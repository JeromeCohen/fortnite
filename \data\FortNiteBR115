Lowest in 2 weeks after first circle has been 7!! I think this problem needs to be discussed more, its not fun to play these kind of games.

Two biggest problems are third partying and mobility overload that gaters third partying even more.

For mobility there are right now: Planes, ziplines, quadcrashers, atks, shopping carts, rifts, rift to go, balloons, gliders, (grappler and launchpad). 

Its way too much and planes are just too easy and too fast. They should not do any damage and there should be high risk using those. Atks and shopping carts are useless in this storm is not any kind of threat meta.

What comes to third partying, every player right now knows how easy it clean up the kills. It will be a thing always in br game but in it current state i think its horrible for casuals and better player both. With all this mobility there are third party after third party and whole game feels like one big cluster all the time. After first circle there are so few people left that makes games so boring.

They should reduce mobility with hard hand and maybe start concereding adding something for kills so you could have change after third fourth and fifth parties.",FortNiteBR

The first game I landed Tilted because why not and searched 3 floors of the so called trump building and did not find one weapon. As a result I died to another player with a shotgun and a SMG but hey, RNG is a bitch, I get it so I tried another game. This game I landed a little farther away from the bus path to maybe get some loot without as much pressure from other players. I looted up and started running to the circle and imagine that, a airplane, yes an airplane came in shooting and I was spamming builds obviously and it drives through my builds and kills me. That and the shots it landed through my turbo build spam. The next game I land at salty and land on a roof to get the chest and 3 others decided to land on me and beat me to death with their axe. Unbeknownst to me they buffed the pickaxe damage to do 20 instead of 10. Which makes no sense but hey. The point is I tried 4 games of Fortnite today just because i was bored and not once was I outgunned, outplayed, or outskilled. What has this game come to? I mean seriously. It's hard to imagine someone actually enjoying the current state of things. Oh and I heard something about a sword being removed, thank God I missed that.",FortNiteBR

The Ice Orb. In case you haven’t seen it or haven’t been able to get online, the Ice Orb is, well, an Ice Orb. It’s currently floating over Polar Peak. If a player gets close to it, it envelops them in snow, only allowing them to see their character and their HUD. So, what is the Ice Orb? Well, it’s the Ice King.

In Seasons 4 and 6, the only Seasons in which the loading screens made sense, relative to what was happening on the map anyway, the Tier 100 skins, Omega and Dire, made their debut early in the Season’s loading screens, both appearing at week 2. In Season 7, however, the Ice King doesn’t appear until week 7. Why? Because the Ice King wasn’t even on the island yet. When a wall is placed on the Orb, it reveals a silhouette of the Ice King. He was imprisoned there.

So why was the Ice King imprisoned, and why did his kingdom come here? The answer is a big, purple, highly adored cube. Kevin, or the Storm King from STW. The Ice King and Kevin had some sort of fight, and Kevin won, imprisoning the King in the Ice Orb. While returning from the battle, Kevin was thrust onto the island by the Rift, which turned him into the form we know him by best. A cube.

To escape the island, Kevin made runes, took control of an island to activate those runes, etc. Season 6.

Kevin’s return home created quite the light show. Even through his prison, the ruler of ice and snow saw it. He instantly connected the dots, but he couldn’t launch an attack due to his now limited powers, because the Infinity Blade, the source of much of his power, was separated from him in his imprisonment. Instead, he sent his kingdom, commanded by Sgt. Winter, ahead of him with the remaining portion of his power.

When the Ice King’s domain, or Chonk, as we know it, reached the island, the Ice King began the long trek to the island. Now he has reached it. After realizing that Kevin escaped, the Ice King began to work on another project. Freeing himself. He will go to Loot Lake, use the remnants of Kevin’s power to free himself, and wage war on the island. Why? Well, it’s only natural to assume that Kevin escaped with our help. With his reclaimed source of power and nearly limitless rage, the Ice King will raise an Ice Legion (hence the challenges) and take possession of the island.",FortNiteBR

When a skin enters the shop for the first time, there's a natural hype surrounding the skin, and it puts you under the impression that you need to get this skin right away. It's how the item shop is designed to get you. But one thing is almost guaranteed... It will always return to the shop eventually.

If by the time it returns, you STILL want the skin, then by all means. The chances are you genuinely want the skin and weren't influenced by the early stages of hype of a new skin being in the shop.",FortNiteBR

NO I GRINDED THOSE LIGHTS HELL NO THOSE ARE MY LIGHTS THAT I GRINDED FOR IF YOU DIDN'T GET  THEM TOO BAD! 

&amp;#x200B;

Well as we know, since Season 5 the XP needed to get levels have been substantially more. So maybe bringing back the omega challenges in a way 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of something like

Reach Season Level 75 (Any Season) for carbide lights..

Reach Season Level 90 (Any Season) for omega lights..

&amp;#x200B;

 That would be good since the people who grinded to 80 in Season 4 will already have them, and those who couldn't play much back then, Summer holidays etc. will have to still grind, even harder to get those lights. 

&amp;#x200B;

Level 90 is a tall order, especially if you play Solos and the fact that the XP required is a crazy amount. Not everyone makes it to level 80 let alone 90 so if we can do this that would be so good. the main complaint omega light owners have is ""I had to grind for them""

  
I play on Switch so fortnite launched halfway through Season 4 during e3 2018 and it was way too less time for 99.99% of Switch players to get to 80. So if fortnite does this, everyone who will have the lights will need to grind it out, one way or another. Omega won't become a ""bot"" skin because  ""bots"" (I dont like to call people bots) can't get to level 90

Like Nick Eh 30 said in one of his streams when he was killing a couple of kids in one shot squads LTM as a solo you don't need a ttv tag or YT tag to get views. now I'm not complying how good people are getting but as well how cocky they are getting at they literally give up matches to kill me when I'm in the storm or when they knock me out and they just simply ""Thirst"" me the hell out. Getting Knocked Down in squads is basically your dead but little chance of survival because you'll get thirsted from the other team. People are more salty in the game joining a playground is really dangerous either you get some squeakers or some pedophilles (yea crazy actually met one) or some defaults (Thats fun) the defaults are harmless just make sure they don't get a gun you'll be alright.

But one problem I have is that every fight ends up with a build battle and using shotguns/smg’s. There are exploits in the game that are really hard to play against, and the game is terrible for new players because they just get jumped on right away and have little to none chance of actually learning the game because every game someone comes up and builds up around them and just shotguns/builds/edits and repeats until their dead. 

So what I’m suggesting is, after someone shoots a shotgun shot, have a period of time to where the shooter can not build. It doesn’t have to be long, just like 1.25/1.5 seconds. This will keep shotguns viable at close, rifles good at medium range, and smg’s good in between. This also allows for exploits like jumping over someone, shooting your shotgun, and then building a floor so you land above them to not be exploitable anymore. 

I don’t want to take building out of the meta, and I don’t want to take shotgun skill out of the meta either. But I feel like this will give a good balance of the two. Every fight ends up in a build battle even if I shoot them with a sniper from 50m away. There should be a way to keep midrange fights still viable in this game because right now, it’s terrible.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite on console is broken/just a mess. Editing and building sensitivity is now the same. Really? Everyone is a tryhard aggressive pos and plays the game like it’s call of duty. Don’t get me wrong it’s fun to get into build fights and kill a few ppl and it’s not even a big deal if I get 3rd party sniped but it’s when every kill hungry tryhard hears a battle and it starts to become 5th and 6th party sniped it gets annoying. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve been bum rushed as soon as I land on a roof by 2-3 ppl swinging pickaxes that do 20 dmg a tick. How about we nerf pickaxes to 15 dmg instead of a 20 when I can’t even get a shotgun to do that much dmg sometimes. Ridiculous. On top of it all when tryhard rushes you and you outbuild them or pop them for good dmg they play super annoying and petty. Hiding and running away. So fun to lose my sheild to someone who does that kind of annoying bs. Not to mention EVERYONE on console has a laser. Never misses a shot not matter the distance. Seriously am I just that unlucky or does everyone else who plays console see this? Side note: I’ve played since season 2 and I can really say that it never used to be this bad but it’s seriously ruining the game at how many aggressive tryhards there are in the game.",FortNiteBR

Please EPIC, we don’t need no new weapons, especially things like that stupid scoped revolver, if you vault a weapon, don’t bring it back in a newer upgraded version. Listen to the community like you did last year. 

Also, while you are at it vault the boomboxes, take out the planes, if not this season please next season, and turrets. 

Stop making the game easier for noobs. Please work on the game itself so it plays well and is actually esports ready. Don’t add any cheesy stuff. It’s astonishing at how much backlash you guys get after you add things but you don’t take it seriously most of the time.

&amp;#x200B;

First off i would like to point out that fortnite isnt even part of the gaming community because most of its fanbase is filled with kids ages 6-12. You might say that its because everyone likes it but that brings me to my next point. Its too popular and cherished streamers either had to quit or change to fortnite even if they were good streamers. Also a lot of the community is hoppers because actual gamers dont want to seem weird so they play it which attracts so many hoppers. It isnt even an original game and a copy of pubg. Games like call of duty bo4 wont even have a campaign because they want to keep up with fortnite. So many games are trying to be like fortnite which ruins the whole point of gaming. Several hardcore gamers have quit because of it.  Fortnite has become a game that has one simple purpose: appeal to everyone except gamers. Draw in the entire world and milk money. Fortnite might be doing to the entire gaming industry what CoD did to FPS games. Fortnite isn't a game anymore, it's a marketing machine.

This post will mention parts and concepts from Save The World's storyline, although not necessarily completely linking them, so spoiler, I guess?

  
We can start off by looking at Rifts, and thanks to Save the World, we have a pretty good understanding of the concept of Beta Rifts ( the regular br rifts) and what they do, and how they affect us. The rifts that already exist in Save The World bring in a certain concept known as ""Reality Hiccups"". These are what we see happening in Battle Royale, things that never existed in that world suddenly coming into existence with no explanation other than a huge rift in the sky, which is the source of all the reality hiccups, including the STW ones and the irl things such as the Durr Burger and Llamas. Most major changes (except for Kevin, I'll explain) have appeared due to reality hiccups. Some rifts disappeared at the end of season 5, but that's because they no longer had a giant rift to support them, the rest that remained were usually seen around areas that only exist because of reality hiccups, and still have energy to exist on their own.

One of the things that peaked interest was the cube, and I'd say I have a decent explanation for that. In Save the World, upon defeating the storm king you can look at a smaller version of the cube that existed in Battle Royale. It's also important to note that what seemed to be a small shard of the Storm king fell into the water the cube was in. After these events, Desiree, one of Homebase's rift specialists, takes it upon herself to detonate the bomb, killing her but also supposedly destroying the dark world - I don't think this happens at all. My suspicion is that the bomb actually ended up blowing the dark worlds energy somewhere else with an active, open rift to take over - Battle Royale island. The shard of the Storm king falling into the water could have allowed him to get complete control over the cube, and when it went into the Battle Royale Island, he started his plan to take over it. It would explain the similar design between the cube monsters and the storm king, him needing an army and creating it with his own power and would explain the similar glows that comes from their eyes/mouths. With the main giant rift being taken over and the dark energy turning it into an Alpha Rift ( a rift in STW that symbolizes dark energy, evil and corruption) , until the Butterfly event, which symbolizes the re-takeover of the Beta Rifts and Alpha Rifts being pushed out. The iceberg was likely a reality hiccup because it would have appeared a couple of days after the normal, reality hiccup creating rifts taking back control. As for what would happen to Desiree is an easy answer if you know both sides of the story. We know Desiree was one of the few people who knew how to ""create and stabilize a rift in a lab environment"", which is exactly what is going on in the middle of Wailing Woods. I wouldn't be surprised if she survived, found a place to work and discover where she ended up.

After that, no clue about the Season 7 stuff, at least not without evidence. I mean, maybe the Ice King salvaged the infinity blade so he could get unstoppable ice power, and there's ANOTHER bunker and all this stuff, I mean the dragons are probably for Chinese New Year which also happens to be Week 9 (February 5th) where the Snowfall skin is unlocked, might be Chinese New Years themed, but other than that, no clue.

Also, if my theory is right, there's some sort of ""King"" theme with this. Ice Legion - Ice Kings Army, Cube Monsters are Storm Kings army, I mean, is this a nod to "" A Good King needs an army to lead"" or something? No clue.

No TL:DR because this is too long to begin with, gl, I'll try to answer any questions.",FortNiteBR

Building should be turned off.
Does the same damage as a harvesting tool against structures.
48 damage for a normale swing and 35 for a leap attack.

Does not recover health overtime or when a player is killed.

With these nerfs it will take 3/5 hits to kill a player on half/full health.
Does not 1 hit structures. 
Is bad af and not overpowered at all so basically only there for the lols.

And we would be able to see the event as it was meant to be.

The Redeploy system has been, however, changed regardless. 

To effectively combat this scenario, move the Glider Redeploy to the trap section and give the large team LTMs unlimited uses. Although this doesn't really solve the issue of glider redeploy existing at all in small squad Battle Royale, this method will negate the restrictions placed on inventory while making the Redeploy mechanic changes barely noticeable in large team LTMs.

For one. If they come barreling in at you, you just build for a few seconds while they approach, then you jump on them and kill the person flying it.

Two. If they don't come barreling in at you, you can EASILY shoot them down. If the person doesn't jump out you can even score 50 dmg on that person... To me, that's just a free 50 dmg on the person I'm going to fight next.

Why I’m boycotting buying it.,"The premise of this argument is that you are a bot if you buy next seasons battlepass and continue to support the direction epic is going with fortnite by lowering the skill gap and increasing rng. 


   Are you sick and tired of planes, boomboxes excessive splodes, epic’s low quality communication on their vision of the game, epic implementing game breaking mechanics before tournaments? Epics continuous steam of pointless new item? Epic not optimizing the game? 
    Yeah me too, that’s why I have deciding to not support epic by refusing to buy the battlepass next season and if you are thinking of purchasing it just know, YOU ARE AN ABSOLUTE BOT. 
    Look the point of this post is not to change any minds or discuss the impact the competitive community could have on Epic with a boycott, it is to enlighten, hopefully one other human, on how capitalism works.
    If you are a corporation you do what makes you the most money, they see what consumers consume and provide more product. As a consumer you VOTE for what you SUPPORT with your money. 
    With this in mind I will be refusing to support epic anymore by not buying the BOT BATTLEPASS that is season 8. That is until epic takes serious steps for the competitive community.Also I would like like to publicly state that anyone I see next season with a battlepass skin is a certified bot!!! You’ve been warned. 

NICE PART OF POST PLEASE READ

Sorry for that negativity up there but here’s the thought process behind it. Obviously we are a small community compared to the whole of the FN scene and in order for people outside of the this sub to buy into a boycott of the season 8 battle pass it would need a catchy phrase like BOT BATTLE pass that can be used to convey a larger idea much like a campaign slogan. The larger idea in this case being the need for epic to change its approach to the game. To have an impact bot battle pass would have to become a meme started by streamers that young kids(largest player base) would have to internalize and participate in the boycott because say their favorite streamer would call them a bot if they bought the battlepass.

Personally I doubt anything will happen from this post but we do have over a month until the next season to spread the word about why only bots will be getting the battle pass next season. You don’t want to be a bot? Easy don’t buy the next battlepass and aye tell a friend they’re a bot if they’re thinking about it ;)

Other slogans are welcome! 

Everyone will be considered a bot and I will be the alpha until public acknowledgement has been made that you will not be be purchasing the BOT BATTLEPASS so what do you bots think?  ",FortNiteBR

Every Chest drops 1 Weapon. No shield. No heal. That weapon is either grey, green or blue, depending on what color that weaponcatagorie's first stage is. 
Pistol = Grey pistol
Snipe = Blue Bolt
AR = Grey M16 (?)
And so on...

You want better weapons? You gotta kill!

Let's say i have a grey AR and i kill someone with that weapon. My grey AR now turns into a Green one. I kill another player, it turns blue, another one it turns to a purple one, and depending if theres multiple weapons with that color, the chances are 50/50 that you get either of those. (Famas, scar or silenced scar for example)

Okay so now you've reached max level Gold Scar. What would you get after killing a player ? 50 health&amp;shield. Like in the Siphon ltm. When you're at full health you get ammo. You max on that? You get resources.
And if youre full one everything and you eliminate someone, a gold weapon drops beneath you, random kind.

So in order to get a Deagle for example you gotta find a pistol laying around and make some kills or hope that someone else already upgraded their pistol to a deagle and eliminate that guy. 

It'd be an interesting concept if you ask me. This way you gotta earn your stuff and not hope for the best that you get a gold p90 and just spray the shit outta someone.

Suggestions welcome and thanks for scrolling through new. You rock

List of bugs that im aware of, or atleast these happen for me.
When landing my glider wont deploy untill im already on the ground. After landing and picking up a weapon, im unable to shoot the weapon or farm materials, its like my mouse 1 stops working, but thats not the case since my mouse is just fine. fps in season 3-5 was +200 from start to finish. But now the late game fps is a comical joke, when building in late game the frames might go under 90 which is quite bad for a 144hz monitor. The amount of micro stutter is amazing.

This is just a theory and not meant as a criticism. Epic as a company should make as much money as they can but everyone seems to be under the assumption that Epic is doing this to balance the game when I think redeploy is there to increase purchases in the item shop.

And yes it is true. One thing that made Fortnite fun was the adventure. Remember traveling on the edge of the storm from moisty to fatal? Now you just take a rift/quad/rift2go/atk/shopping cart/plane/glider redeploy or even a zipline. Not to mention but theres a hoverboard in the making too!

Also building is so key to fortnite’s fun factor and all epic seems to do is leave it aside. How can one not prioritize the key?! For ex Real Madrid was seen as the greatest, but all soccer fans know it was because of Ronaldo. Now as soon as Ronaldo left last year, have you ever heard of Real Madrid? 

The only reason the pros still play is because of the dollar sign, now it’s only a matter of time and some of em will start to deny tournament invites and such. 

I might b sounding crazy. But thanks to Epic for breaking this game! I find myself so much more productive and less toxic after quitting.",FortNiteBR

I thought that with the decrease of minis from 10 to 6, you’d find more minis. However, it may be due to the amount of new items added, or items that decreased in rarity, that it’s unlikely for me to walk out of retail or salty with shield. 

This might be just me having bad games, or having bad luck, but let me know if this is happening to you too. 

I don’t mean to complain, because I honestly enjoy this Patch because of the amount changed.

1. Land in the same place as your squad. You guys are a TEAM; you can't expect just one teammates to challenge a whole squad. If you aren't happy with where you are landing, play solo's or at least have a mic to tell your teammates that you should go somewhere else.
2. If you don't have a mic, play solos; you need a mic for coordination and call-outs.
3. Sharing is caring. Share your shields, especially after a revive or you have some spare. Don't be a dick and leave that one revived team mate on 30hp.
4. If you find a something your teamates could do with (scar, slurp juice, chug etc.), ask your teamates or (this is what i used to do when my headphones broke) put a marker on where you are and start juggling that item with one of your items towards your team mates.",FortNiteBR

So this dude I lost to earlier because of the ending circles- Messaged me saying, “I’m guessing you play scrims” because of how hard I was trying to win that game. I had no transportation and he had 3 jump pads. 

I had no mobility while he jump padded over any hills and river valleys that I’m struggling to build over and fight the storm. Meanwhile, he’s blasting me with explosives and AR rounds, while I’m stressing out of my mind to defend myself. 

This is just one example of hundreds of games I’ve lost in second place since the ending circles were changed. Ik people will think I’m not clutch or don’t know what I’m doing... that’s not the case. 

These last circles are just too hard to deal with on console OR they move too rapidly without giving players time to adjust.

That concept should never exist in anything but an LTM. Redeployable gliders were removed for a reason; nobody liked them. They allowed you to just glide away from any problems you may have been having with no punishments whatsoever. Adding more movement does NOT solve the problem with there being too much movement options, but Epic seems to think so. They now instead made it an item that I will never use, and is only taking up valuable drop chance in chests instead of shields, which I still seem to never get when landing. It doesn't help that in this same patch, the stack maximum for mini shields was reduced to 6 from 10. This is a huge nerf in general to shields, which were already hard to come by in the first place. Along with this, other items were changed to blue and green rarity, meaning these will also be taking up space in chests for shields more frequently. The truth is; shields are necessary. You need shields to take a fight if you're going against somebody with shields. If you don't, you are probably going to lose that fight. Losing the game to RNG is something that nobody likes, and Epic seems to have just increased that chance by a whole lot. Terrible update.",FortNiteBR

I went into the game with the mindset of just trying it out, and see what all the new planes and stuff was all about.   
In total I have 104 wins, nothing major, and I started playing in season 3. Now, I would always have called myself a decent player, but far from being the best obviously. When I quit, I was getting around 3-4 wins a day, sometimes less to be honest.   
The thing is, why is everyone trying so hard? I went back into the game to play casual, just to have some fun etc. but everyone was sweating. Literally, I was wondering if the dude that killed me so fast I couldn't even react was wearing a sweat band.  


Everyone is doing the 90s I've seen on YouTube in seconds, trying to be the next Mongraal or Tfue, maybe a bit of both. Come on man, it's a GAME. I doubt 90% of the people I encountered today will even get a career in gaming as I'm starting to think they are trying to achieve. I can't see any other reason for people to try so damn hard. Like, it's normal when playing a ""competitive"" game that you should try to win, yes. But editing walls faster than you can blink is not just competitive, it seems like an obsession lol.  


Thinking about it, to get as good as the people that owned me today, you can't have a social life, honestly, I don't believe you can. Being so good must takes hours and hours of grind every single day even on weekends.   


I remember in CS:GO back in the day, when people were trying hard, it was to reach Global Elite - or maybe join a pro team, what do I know. But what is it that makes people try their ass off, and build a damn hotel with toilets and stuff when you hit them once? I could go on and on as I'm generally curious as to why this might be?  


I get people want to maybe get a win or something, but what are they trying to achieve, or should I say: What are *YOU* trying to achieve, as I've heard it's 90% of the player base who is like this nowadays.  


Edit: I don't know if anyone has ever watched people like.. Symfuhny, Mongraal or Fnatic\_Eryc. When I play, it feels like it's people who try really hard to be them, or play like them. So, my final question in a long shit-post:

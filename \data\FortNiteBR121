Planes were perfectly fine prior to the update. It was NOT hard to counter them at all. Now theyre fucking worthless for everything except rating to the zone.

Vaulting burst rifles was a BIG mistake. Many people prefer burst rifles over regular ARs. Many people aren't aware of the buff they received a while ago that made the first 2 bullets almost always hit when you use FSA. ( read the patch notes people!). They were godly at close to medium range and are very decent at long range. Just because it didnt fit your play style doesn't mean its trash.

The only problem with guided missiles was the fact that you could have a lot of rockets back then. You could shoot them out wasily and build a damn wall to protect youraelf from it.



I am seeing a lot of nerf requests that make no fucking sense. People want balloons to make noise. That makes no sense at all first of all. Its a balloon. Not a damn engine. They are out in the open. Shoot them and they cant do crap about it. Shoot their balloon and they fall to their death. They cant build or really defend themselves in any way.

Explosives are in a fine state right now. Quit requesting nerfs for them or asking for vaults. 1 single wall can protect your ass from ANY explosion. Learn to build a wall

People are requesting that one of the most balanced guns gets nerfed. The heavy sniper. Its in a perfect state. Nothing needs to be changed at all.

Deagles are in a perfect state as well. They can only one shot wood. Deal with it. The falloff range for it is perfect. It needs no changes.

Pickaxes are even better since the buff. If someone smacks you, smack them back or land more strategically. 
People STILL want planes to be nerfed. They are fucking worthless now. Quit bitching about it. They didnt need that nerf to begin with.

Not everything needs a nerf. Quit trying to ruin shit with your shitty suggestions. Learn to adapt. Its not hard.

But what does the plane serve other than a game breaking, useless tactic, seemingly created solely for one reason: to make your experience worthless?   


Once again, hear me out.   


So to be more in depth, here are the main reasons why the planes are trash.   


Point 1: getting 3rd partied by these things is incredibly frustrating. You can waste your entire game, down to the last 25 or so people and get attacked by one of these planes. The planes wouldn't be so op if they didn't have guns on them, but yet, lets add guns onto the planes because... why not? I guess? The movement speed and positioning part of the plane doesn't bother me. What bothers me is if I'm in the middle of a fight, I have someone down and I'm going for another kill, only to be shot at by a plane flying that can move 4x faster than someone on foot. Remove the guns off of the planes. It serves zero purpose in terms of actual gameplay mechanics.   


Point 2: Being able to eject is something that seems to be no issue, but I argue it is. Since redeploy was taken out of the game, all modes that DO have redeploy, the speed of redeploy has been slowed down. Aka, if you're in the air after a redeploy, you're slower than if you took a jump pad. Add that to the plane. The advantage that you already have by being in a plane that can also shoot is incredibly high. You're already multiple times faster than your other opponents.   


Point 3: The plane nerfs have done absolutely nothing. The usefulness of the plane has gone down not a single bit. If you make it moderately less useful, it will make the plane better off to use in the grand scheme of the game, if you still want to keep your core audience that is tired of all these gameplay breaking, useless items. Need I say more? They added in a boombox that doesn't allow you to build, when the whole point of this game and what sets it apart is the building. Stupid.   


Once again, I'm not a some disgruntled user that has nothing better to do, I put time and effort into these thoughts. It may not be the most progressive post ever, but it's seriously something that needs to be addressed. The planes have run their course and they're seemingly a failure in terms of the community response. I'm sure this post will get a lot of heat, but it's something that 100% needs to be addressed because the planes are completely unnecessary to the game. It makes you angrier, it's a toxic add-on and either needs to be taken out, or remove what makes it so useful.   


I would be fine with the plane if it didn't have guns, the second point was purely a statement made based off of what the devs of Fortnite have done to redeploy. The second point is mainly about keeping consistency.   


Have a good day. ",FortNiteBR
8,Streetride,1547022034,ae4twg,123,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ae4twg/has_anyone_else_lost_friends_to_this_game_due_to/,1,"Has anyone else lost ""friends"" to this game due to bad attitudes?"," 

I will apologize in advance for the wall of text, but this has been weighing on me pretty heavy for the last couple weeks, and im curious as to whether or not anyone can relate?

cliffs: ""friends"" being really terrible people, and using the ""its just a game"" line while at the same time saying really nasty shit about me and other people in our squad. Lots of ragequits from them, and other things that are really not cool.

This game is really showing my ""friends"" true colors. These are not online friends, these are friends that come over to my house all the time, and we have a good time. I would tell them to not come over anymore, but im the black sheep of the family, and they are also friends with my older brother and younger brother. (29,23)

So this isn't some little kid squabble, these guys are ""grown men"" and im also a very forgiving person, but this game is just highlighting the fact that I need to get them out of my life completely. They also want to go into business with me, and I don't think its ever going to happen at this point.

Fortnite has shown me just how selfish,unmotivated,prideful,angry, and unforgiving they are. It has been highlighted the most this season with the introduction of planes. The three guys in my squad dogpile me for flying the plane despite me getting multiple kills and assists, and holding my own. I even jump out of my plane the second one of them screams for help. The second i scream for help they loot up, and wont even grappler towards me, and laugh when i die because i was in the plane.

I cannot play with my squad anymore, and i dont even want to see them at my house using my dishes or eating my food. Fortnite has just been a casual game for me, but now my ""friends"" are personally attacking me. Im the black sheep of the squad also, and I get zero respect. Usually at the end of a game i will have 4-5 kills and about 8-12 assists. I also carry all of the support items like rifts,big pots,med kits, and boom boxes. Everyone else is running a deagle,shotgun,smg,scar, and 10 minis, and you have to wait on them to drop you minis instead of them coming to you. They think im some horrible player even though im a team player. Im no stranger to competitive gaming either so i understand what makes up a good team. They also try and point to my fortnite tracker stats to say im a bad player, and they set up arbitrary rules in 1v1 gametypes to try and somehow prove a point.

Last night was the straw that broke the camels back when my squad turned their xboxs off because i was beating them in a 1v1. They have too much pride, and they think im really bad, so when I start beating them they see red. One of them even quit for two weeks when i kept beating him in a 1v1.

I think the only reason i stick around is because they are pretty good players, and they are consistent with their hours. Other than that, they are very bad at callouts. I call out the skin, the location, and how much health they have when i land a shot. Everyone else freezes up, and they fend for themselves to pad their stats. Unfortunately for me, fortnite is not halo and i cannot see their stats unless they read them off, and fortnite also doesnt count assists on the tracker network.

Once again, sorry for the wall of text, but this game has shown me that just because its a game, it does not excuse someones poor character. If they would do this in a game, what would happen if something else was on the line like a business, or what would they try to do with a woman im talking to or some other scenario where i could get hurt for them to get ahead?",FortNiteBR

I looted a house (silenced sniper/ballons/small shields), grabbed a plane, pointed it towards Junk Junction, and flew it along the northern coast.  

Came back after a minute or so, landed the plane on one of those lower grassy areas along the outskirts of the map, and hid in the single bush (with a plane right next to it).  Finished up an email and noticed that there were only 3 left, the circle was closing in 5 seconds and I was stuck down there with no mats and a circle too small to safely fly the plane out of.  I ballooned straight up, looked down and saw a pretty sweaty match below me.  

One guy left, I pull out my silenced sniper, watched him struggle to find me in the last tiny circle, he pulled out a deagle, looked up and spotted me, we both shot about the same time.  His was a body shot, mine was a headshot.  Game over.

Had pangs of guilt for a second for a cheap, lazy win but figured a win is a win.  Any similar stories out there?

Played from season 1 to season 4. Somehow achieved nearly 500 wins. Eventually, I became burned out. Then, recently -  I slowly came back as a player this season. Finally, I purchased the battle pass like an irresponsible Leprechaun. Here's my quick summary -

#                                                               Cursory:

**Likes**: 👍 aka - *Aspects of the game that I Admire and Applaud.*

▶ Suppressed Sniper, Heavy Sniper, Pump Shotgun, &amp; SMG's (fond of these weapons aside from the compact SMG)

▶ New High-Grade Skins (ex: Nara, Frozen Pack, Slushy Soldier)

▶ Desert Biome (This biome has been incredible)

▶ Playground &amp; Events Improvements

▶ Creative (Glad they're finally rewarding the gifted creative thinkers in the community)

**Dislikes**: 👎 aka - *Aspects of the game that I disapprove of or Loathe.*

▶ Ziplines, Planes, Plane Outposts, &amp; Quadcrasher (pretty self-explanatory) 

▶Quad Launcher, Compact SMG, Heavy Assault Rifle, &amp; Dual Pistols (pointless weapons that only reduce the chance of getting a useful item in BR)

▶Snowy Terrain (aka the demolition of the locations remembered as, Flush Factory and Greasy Grove)

▶ Boom Box, Presents, &amp; Port-A-Fortress (completely useless)

▶ Grappler, Balloons, &amp; Stink Bombs (I respect epic's objective for stink bombs, but I would rather have grenades as they are more situational)

&amp;#x200B;

#                                                                 Conclusion:

That's all. Before you get personally offended by my preferences and opinions, I want you to acknowledge that I might like the snowy terrain one day, or even like planes and lastly that we're not the same person so we'll have our differences.  This is only a portion of my thoughts as I would only bore you to continue.

The Infinity Blade was both OP and poorly designed.  I think most of us can agree on that.  It's removal was a good thing for the game.

However, I don't understand why so few people here fail to embrace the idea of Mythic Items.

Here's what Epic has said about it's philosophy behind the idea...

""The presence of Mythic items in gameplay is to provide an interaction a step above the Legendary item functionality and something you’ll continue to see. To us, that means changing the way the game is played for those who interact with that item. The addition of items in this tier provide new and flavorful ways to interact with the map and generally shake up normal play across default modes.""

Providing the map with dependable items that provide gameplay variety can only be a good thing in my opinion.  For a game that relies on repeated plays, I fail to see how more unique gameplay experiences could ever be a bad thing.

Note: Mythic Items depend on good balance.  I think most of us trust Epic to get the balance right eventually to any item they deliver.

Now, I do not believe my opinion is fact.  I do not know everything and enjoy gaining new insights so that I can change my  mind.  Iwould appreciate hearing someone give a thoughtful response as to why the premise is flawed.

It was easy to play but hard to master. The people who dedicated their lives to the game were generally better than those who play on occasion. With all the hype around melee (game cube) and the Wii coming out a few years after, the fan base was excited for the next game they could love and grind. However, this did not happen. Nintendo introduced rng aspects to a mechanic based fighting game. New mechanics such as random tripping is just one of the changes catering towards the newer player base. This game was well recieved by kids like me at the time, but as we continued to play we realized just how bad the rng aspects were. While melee tournaments are still being held and their is a huge fan base for the game, brawl is only remembered as the worst of the franchise and many would like to forget. 




This is the same thing currently happening to fortnite. Fortnite is now brawl. Beginner players are happy with being favored until they put time into the game and discover how enraging the rng actually is. Veteran players wish to return to the “golden age” of Fortnite where everyone was striving to get better and not picking up random op items that are added weekly. I myself am one of those however I have quit the game. I still like the game I just have no motivation to get on.

I didn't even know this was a thing until I recently played on my friend's xbox for the first time and heard no footsteps while I was walking/running around. I had no idea people playing on other platforms don't experience this. While playing on Switch, I often can't tell if I'm hearing my own footsteps or an enemy's, and it's not only quite annoying but also a huge disadvantage when playing cross-platform.

Please tell me this isn't just me. I play docked if that makes a difference. Has anyone else been experiencing this? Would love for this to get addressed (as well as the other performance issues docked Switch players regularly experience)!",FortNiteBR

I'm trying to compile a list of bugs that currently exist in the game and need to be acknowledged before the next actual (not content) full update. I'll start with what I know of currently, and I'll add your guys' bugs that you mention in replies to the main post.

**Vehicles:**
  - If exiting a plane while it's upside down while on the ground you can be put under the map because the game can't decide where to put you, then you appear back in the correct spot 3-5 seconds later.

  - When jumping out of a plane, you are occasionally unable to redeploy your glider.

  - The Quadcrasher will take an absurd amount of damage while landing at the wrong angle (generally when it hits the center of the underside of the vehicle at a 45 degree upwards angle)

  - You will still occasionally take fall damage from landing all four wheels of the Quadcrasher.

**Items:**

  - Switching from a sniper to any other weapon will cause it to have the inaccuracy of that sniper's noscope, leading to a very inaccurate shot after quickly switching from a sniper to another type of weapon such as an Assault Rifle.

  - You will take fall damage in odd situations while using balloons, especially while using balloons to slow your fall, when you hit the ground you are likely to be knocked or eliminated.

  - The Scoped Assault Rifles will give you hitmarkers without doing damage at longer ranges, and the bullets are not 100% accurate as they are supposed to be from what it seems.

**Cosmetics:**

  - Skins with physics randomly don't have them at times, this includes backblings such as capes also.

  - While using Stage 5 of Ragnarok you will notice you have poor vision of your crosshair due to the bones on his shoulder.

  - While using Stage 5 of Ragnarok, his eyes do not glow/shine nearly as much as they used to even on max settings. 

  - The Deadfire skin doesn't seem to be reactive after getting kills anymore, while it's pickaxe still is.

  - Remus will sometimes stand up on top of the backpack and be moved partially into your character model, and Remus being completely out of the backpack.

  - The Frozen Red Shield is slightly larger than the regular Red shield (unintentionally I would assume).

  -  Heads and bodies can swapped while changing between skins with selectable styles. It can happen between any two skins if one has selectable styles.

This is my first post on here and I wanted to start kind of a discussion about the fated Drum Gun. Now if I remember the Drum Gun was removed due to being overpowered and was/is a very controversial weapon, nonetheless I also know that there are still people that want it to come back in some way, myself included. So how would you feel if it returned with the following changes:

-Mag size reduced from 50 to 35
-Fire rate reduced (by any amount really)
-Rarity increased to Epic and Legendary
-Damage decreased from 27 and 26 to 21 and 20 depending on rarity

This is also kind of a suggestion to Epic Games to help balance it (or at least balance it more than it was) if it were to ever return. Looking forward to seeing your guys thoughts on this! :]",FortNiteBR

What do you guys think is the best way to offer new players a way to get into the game?

I think there should be a tutorial that you are forced to complete before you ever launch your first battle royale match (""unless you click the ""I've played before!"" Button)

This should include

But if you remember there was so much wrong with season 1 and 2. So many things were unbalanced and it had a lot of RNG involved. There were not as many good places to loot and in a final circle your loot is maybe blue to purple where now its green to gold where much more items are viable. Most people started playing Fortnite (that I know) because it was fun, silly and it didn't matter if you died, just hop into a new game. If Fortnite didn't change and adapt then it wouldn't have lasted. Also what keeps this game alive is the new, fun and exciting things they add. Planes are so much fun at the moment and I hope this community doesn't get them vaulted because the casual players like them. If you are a pro or competitive player then learn how to combat them and change and adapt, they have been in the game for almost 6 weeks now and have made getting around the map so much easier, where in season 1 and 2 was so hard and then more people died to the storm. I'm not saying ""get good"" I'm just saying try to adapt to new things, and I get it, its hard when a new thing is added every week but most are pointless weapns that any building can counter.

Each weapon variant serves its own purpose and gives its own advantages to your gameplay, until now:

Heavy: high damage and low bullet drop with long reload and loud audio

Silenced: medium damage, short reload, and very low audio 

Hunting: low damage, extremely quick reload with no scoping mechanism, medium-low audio

BOLT: this one just doesn’t fit in nicely. Medium damage but insignificantly more than the silenced, short reload, medium audio

I’m frankly surprised that they kept the bolt in the game. It already felt like it’s a mismatch in the sniping meta. The silenced seems like an incredible adjustment to balance the bolt variant, rather than an addition. 

Also, I know some people are going to say “there needs to be bad weapons in the game” and similar statements, probably mentioning the pistol as comparison. That doesn’t apply here. Snipers are game changing weapons in the right hands. A one shot weapon shouldn’t be grouped in the same nature that basic weapons are grouped.

&amp;#x200B;

Winter Royale was operated through the tournament system and featured more than 9,000,000 players across North America and Europe competing during the two-day qualifiers.  We’re really excited to run more events like this in the future, providing players with opportunities to earn recognition by competing directly alongside the best of the best in Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

We’ve seen some questions as to why there aren’t any tournaments scheduled currently and wanted to drop in provide a quick update on the schedule for in-game tournaments for the next couple months.

&amp;#x200B;

During January we’ll be transitioning to a new tournament backend system which will help enable features such as live in-game leaderboards during events, support for tournaments to take place across multiple knockout rounds, and allow us to create a richer variety of events to keep the experience fresh and exciting. Fewer in-game tournaments will be scheduled in early January as we transition to the new backend system and test the new functionality, but we anticipate quickly ramping up to a full tournament offering utilizing the new features. 

&amp;#x200B;

We’re looking forward to continuing to update the system to support a more varied offering of competitions, improving competitive integrity, and celebrating the accomplishments of competitors.

&amp;#x200B;

Expect additional communication around competitive Fortnite and competition in general in the coming weeks!

I feel like this is a fairly new thing but it's counteractive nonetheless. We can disagree with a suggestion but there is no reason to tell someone that they need to stop complaining. Because we don't. The point of the suggestion flair is for suggestions. Complaining about things and giving your idea for a solution and opening up a discussion about why other players do or don't care about it is not toxic or childish. It is very disappointing to see people hating on a suggestion simply because they feel that they won't use it much. I saw a post about an option to default to a certain game mode when loading Fortnite and it got nothing but hate. ""No, we don't need that. It's just one button."", And about 10 comments that said just ""No."". What's the point in hating on somebodies suggestion if it doesn't affect you at all? This is why I feel like as long as there is no developer interactive Subreddit specifically for Fortnite complaints or suggestions, we need to stop complaining. I sort by new and I'm pretty active on this subreddit but I have noticed that since glider redeploy, this subreddit has been more split than ever. The day planes got put into the game I complained that they where overpowered and affected gameplay too much. I got told to shut up... Then streamers started to complain and now everybody wants a plane nerf. I feel we have to actually hear every voice equally. If your favorite streamer says that they want planes removed and you base your whole opinion on that then pay the same respect to everybody else who has something to say about the game and give them an actual reason why not, besides saying ""No."". I get it's a meme now to disagree with no reason, but constructive criticism is very helpful for a video game that changes as much as Fortnite. And also, the whole OG thing. We can shut up about that now. Please. It's so annoying that when somebody has this small thing that most people don't and they think it's a cool thing that's kind of special to them in a fun way, we hate on them the same amount as somebody who talks about themselves like they are better because they played a month before most people.

I started midway through season 3, so I may have a nostalgic haze, but the biggest change in the game has been the constant nerfs to building.  


I am not particularly good at building or shooting, but when I started you could be good at either shooting or building and have a chance, building probably was a bit stronger at that point in time, but there was diversity in playstyle that was supported.  Obviously if someone was good at both, they'd win.  


Now, building is little more than a gimmick.  Material health has been consistently nerfed.  Now there are multiple guns that can just shred through builds, dynamite and boomboxes level structures, grapplers negate height, planes just level builds, there's too much counter to builds after builds were nerfed.  


I feel gun balance within guns is pretty okay, but balance between guns and items and vehicles vs. building is way broken.  I'd like to see building get some love.

Even though I see many happy comments glad that the worst weapon in the game is gone, I really don’t think vaulting was the way to go.

For me, vaulting means epic was just lazy enough to easily delete two lines of code and type two more lines on the patch notes. I believe every weapon that has been vaulted could have had a chance to be better, however epic did not give them that chance.  Below, there are some examples of things that could have changed in weapons instead of a lazy vault.

*Six shooter*
The newest addition to the vault was one of the weapons I was hyped for the most. I believe the six shooter had a chance to be a mix in between the revolver and the SMG, however that did not happen. This weapon could have worked more like Mcree’s weapon from overwatch. The primary fire (the slower one) is a semi high damage ultra accurate weapon that can change the course of a fight with the correct aiming skills and the quick fire part of the gun makes it an alternative in close range combat which has the effect that a burst smg would have meaning it would quickly kill if aimed close and properly. 

To do so, the six shooter would need more damage on its primary fire with little to no bloom which would allow it to be a good mobile mid range alternative. When bursting the secondary fire, the six shooter could use a slight  bloom decrease which would make it more skill based than luck based.

*Guided missile*
This is a very controversial weapon that can only work in the game of perfectly balanced. To do so, there are a few things that could change. First of all, the damage output should be reverted to the original (don’t be mad yet, there are various nerfs coming next). The second change would be making the actual size of the rocket around 25% bigger. This would make it easier to shoot down. To avoid making the weapon so campy, the guided missile could leave a small smoke trail which would slowly vanish giving anyone who sees the rocket the chance of trying to figure. Finally, I would make the rocket one shot with an AR. This would creat an aiming counter instead of a building counter making it a way more fair weapon in game.

To conclude, I am not saying that any of this changes are the correct changes for the game, however they set an example on how vaulting is not always the right way to go and how epic should not give up on their weapons.",FortNiteBR

This means the game is getting more skill based (not by miles but that's obviously a step forward) and less luck and unskilled plays, which is actually really great. 

That means that players have more chances in getting good in the game rather than the game getting the players feel they play good, and still - it is encouraging variant gameplays.

To my opinion, the game should be way more skill based, but I can understand (though not agree) with the approach the game takes.

The point and TL;DR is that a lot of unskilled and unusual fps shooter items have been nerfed so now the game is a bit more skilled base.

Season 1 was so basic, Season 2 was better and Season 3 was GOOD. It's been getting stale slowly since Season 4.

Now. In Season 7, the hype for this game seems to be mostly over. Seeing all my other friends who play since Season 1 quit playing. I am now not spending any money on the game anymore and am actually investing in a bunch of stuff I never thought of before. 

Fortnite has come second place, and I find a lot of joy in games I used to play (Dark Souls, Ninja Gaiden, PUBG, and soon hopefully Resident Evil 2) that I am no longer interested in Fortnite-cosmetics. My locker is so stuffed with cosmetics I never use, I came to realise I may have spent over ONETHOUSAND euros on this game alone.

Considering what an avid gamer I used to be, this hurts. Thinking of all the full priced games I would've been able to get instead... Now I know I am probably one of the few Season 1 players who have spent a fortune on this game, so I won't ask anything regarding to that, but if you have spent a lot on this game, are you in the same boat as me? Do you still like Fortnite as much as before? Or is it getting old and stale?

Friends around have been saving so much money each month (I don't have any financial issues) that they are now able to actually take care of themselves again. The addiction for them was huge.

&amp;#x200B;

Point being: After maining this game for about a year (Save the World included of course), I decided to quit playing all that much and just do weekly challenges and finish battle passes. I barely look at the item shop anymore and all my \*OG\*-skins haven't been worth much to me ever. They should all just be rereleased, including Battle Pass skins.

A revolver-style pistol, fires slow and accurate when sighting and fast and reckless when not.

It's being vaulted. Why? Because of the people of this subreddit, Epic's main form of feeback.

Now, onto the problem I came here to discuss. The people of this subreddit seem to have a very skewed view of items in this game. If something is underpowered they cry ""vault it"" and if it cant be beaten by build spam they cry again, ""vault it!"" This has been the sad fate of many items. The Tac SMG, the Semi-Auto Sniper, and now the Six Shooter. The problem with this is the way its looked at.

The main complaint of the Six Shooter was its lack of damage, and the fact that even when scoping it was rather innaccurate. Everyone went ""Its bad, bring back the dualies."" The problem with this is the cry for it to be vaulted. Instead of looking at every item with ""bad/broken, vault it"" it would help the game to be more open with more interesting items. A much better idea would be to say ""This item is underpowered, what if we did \_\_\_\_ to buff it and make it more viable?"" But instead you just keep with the same cry, ""VAULT IT!!!!""""

This is the same fate as the Infinity Blade, a new idea and interesting item. People didnt like how far you could launch or how it shredded builds. What's the logical thing to say here? ""Decrease building damage and make it launch less far."" But no, you went out with your same cry ""VAUUULLLLTTTTT IIIIIITTTTT!"" and so Epic did, even causing them to rethink their look at Mythic items as a whole.

The main cause of some of this, I've heard, is just people mirroring Streamer's thoughts, and peoples unwillingness to change their playstyle.

This same issue is coming up with planes, you can hear them coming from plenty far away, and they break at most 3 vertical tiles worth of buildings depending on how they're used. People, knowing full well planes could come at them, continue building up into the sky with no hesitation and then cry ""OP"" when they cant drop down a few tiles to avoid the LOUD INCOMING VEHICLE. 

Why? Why do these awesome interesting items that epic keeps pumping out keep getting shot down?

Because people don't want to change their playstyle, or be open to the idea of buffing/nerfing items. You could beat the Infinity Blade by dodging and shooting more, while building less but people continuted to spam builds, post their clips and complain to the sub. You can avoid planes by dropping down and taking shots at them when you hear them coming, but people continue spamming builds, complaining about Third Partying, etc., and complain when they die to the plane. The Six Shooter had very clear cut issues, its accuracy was too low and its damage too bad to warrant picking it up, which could be obviously fixed easily. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - People complain about items because they don't want to change their playstyle, and items get vaulted for being underpowered when its obvious how you could buff them to make them viable instead of removing them.",FortNiteBR

Auto Rifles: All normal AR’s and Scar’s are just fine. Suppressed Scars are well balanced as well. Heavy AR’s need a nerf: a gold heavy AR can do 98 headshot damage. If someone gets a lucky headshot it should not deal nearly half my health and feel like I got shot by a sniper.

Shotguns: Pump shotgun’s are pretty balanced at the moment while purple and gold pumps I feel like could be worked on the ability to one pump is nice. Heavy shotguns are kind of in need of a buff now I feel like if they could implement a within 1meter full damage headshot that deals 200 damage they would be useful again. Tactical shotguns are in desperate need of a buff no one runs them late game because they are very inconsistent the spread is  way to big. If Epic reduces the spread the gun might become more consistent and a viable option again.

Sub machine guns: I think epic games should remove all normal submachine guns but keep the compact smg. Instead of normal smg’s epic should bring back the suppressed smg. The normal smg is very inconsistent in my opinion because of bloom from the mid distance between shotgun and AR. But in the limited time game mode the suppressed smg makes those mid distances feel more like a skilled gun fight because it eliminates so much of the RNG. Tactical submachine guns will forever be missed but I feel they can be a bit spamy. 

Sniper rifles: The bolt action sniper is perfect in my eyes. The hunting rifle is also balanced. However the heavy sniper is way to powerful I should not be afraid of a gun for its body shot abilities. A heavy sniper should deal 120 for purple and one 1 25 for gold. This makes a little less terrifying to be hit by but also still does a significant amount of damage to the opponent. The heavy snipers damage to structures should stay the same. I also feel as if snipers in the close quarters should be hit scan. Because a sniper shot in about a (0-5) meter range would be impossible to dodge if some shoots directly at u

Explosives: Normal rocket launchers and grenades, rocket launcher damage to structures needs to be nerfed. When Rockets got buffed to when the blast from a rocket not only effects one wall but some of the walls around it, the grenade launcher became obsolete because the rocket launcher could shoot farther and was easier to control. The one advantage grenade launchers have over rocket launchers is chaos. If this nerf to rocket launchers was to happen I would raise the amount of rocket ammo someone can carry to 25-40. It’s excessive but it would be difficult to run out and still be counter able. The quad launcher in my opinion does not need to be in the game because while it is not broken it can be annoying and if u were to increase the players ammo capacity the quad launcher would be broken. Grenades are balanced. Dynamite needs a nerf. It has an insane blast radius. That can destroy way to many builds.

Pistols: the regular pistols need a buff. Body shot damage is very low and the range is awful. Suppressed pistols are decent but there is slight room for improvement to damage and range as well. Hand cannon is very balanced right now I feel like they could increase the fall of damage to 60 to make it more viable but it is still usable. 

Mini gun: the mini gun in my opinion needs to be removed while not many people run it the gun encourages spam and takes away from building. 
 
Items: Boogie bomb needs to remain in the game. At the moment I feel it is balanced. Impulse and shockwave grenades need to be brought back because it took a good player to use them. Balloons, I don’t really have a problem with balloons but I feel like they should not spawn in chests. They should only be floor loot. However if bounce bass were brought back then remove balloons. Boom boxes, just remove, no matter the nerf no one will like them and they are anointing to deal with because it removes all skill from the game and puts all the emphasis on who has the most amount of health to win an rng battle. Portafortress, no issue it’s easy to counter. Rift to goes, love them keep them in the game.  Presents are great 

Traps: spike trap needs to be nerfed to 125 damage. Launch pads are great. Campfires are great. Turrets need to be removed even though there have been several nerfs to the turret it’s still annoying to deal with. Bouncers need to be brought back. Freeze traps I could care less but if brought back let them only freeze you for 5 seconds. 

Vehicles: golf carts are perfectly fine, great for transporting a team. Shopping carts, great never use them but don’t have an issue with them. Quad crashers are perfectly fine. Planes need to be nerfed into the ground or removed. If epic wants to keep them in the game. Take the turret of the plane. Nerf the planes heal to 300 and don’t allow the plane to destroy structures and knock players off of high drifters such as buildings and mountains. 

Shields: minis are great. Big shields are great. Slurp juice is great. Chug jug is great. Mushrooms are great.

Health: bandages are great. Medkits are great. Slurp juice is great. Chug jug is great. Apples are great.
 
Materials: make farming slightly easier. Increase the materials in chests up to 30. 

Storm: the endgame storm does not need to function the way it does. While it counters turtling, it harms the aggressive players and helps the campers who avoid the fights. Bring back the storm that was in the game from season 1-4. 

I believe that’s most the items in fortnite I didn’t include some of the vaulted weapons just because some of them are broken and probably better of not coming back although I do miss the drum gun.

412,SampledChocolate31,1546927125,adr9ji,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/adr9ji/how_to_make_fortnite_great_again/,1,How to Make Fortnite Great Again,"Although Fortnite is still an amazing game, I think everyone can agree that it’s not at its maximum potential and where the game once was. I’ve come up with a list of ideas that can be fixed/removed/added into the game that could make this game near perfection.

First of all, I’m going to start with some items that I believe should be vaulted.

Vault:
Six Shooter - Yes, I realize it’s going to be removed in the next patch, just thought I’d put it here.

Quad Launchers - They serve no purpose in this game at all other than to just be annoying, just another spammy weapon that doesn’t belong in the game.

Compact SMG - I understand it’s not as OP as it once was, but I feel like the white, green and blue versions of regular SMGs are good enough.

Heavy AR - This AR is so broken. It has the best accuracy out of any of the ARs in the game and the damage is insane, I understand there could be tweaks made to it but at the same time I feel like 2 ARs is enough.

Heavy Shotgun - With the buff of pumps recently, there’s really no use for this to be in the game, you rarely find anyone taking a heavy over any colored pump nowadays.

Stink Bombs - Another redundant item in the game, no real use for them other than getting upset you got these in a chest instead of minis.

Boombox - Again, a stupid thing that shouldn’t have been added in the first place, I know changes for it are coming but either way, don’t see why it’s in the game.

Turrets - Yet again another spammy thing that doesn’t belong in the game. 

Dynamite - Not much explanation needed her, an unneeded spam type thing in the game. 

That is it for the items I believe should be vaulted, there were some items that almost made this list including:
Balloons
Boogie Bombs
Bush
X-4 Stormwing

Next up is the items I believe should be added back into the game:

Bouncers - Easy way to get off high structures and mountains, useful in build battles, should’ve never been vaulted in the first place.

Revolvers - This is a random one but I actually really enjoyed using these when they were still in the game, and I could see them making a place in the meta with Hand Cannons starting to be used.

Tactical SMG - These were amazing when they were in the game, a good replacement if they vaulted the Compact SMG.

Moving on, I have come up with a list of some tweaks to weapons and items in the game that either need it because of how bad they are or of how OP they are:

Suppressed AR - I seriously don’t understand the purpose of these in their current state, the accuracy isn’t great, I could see a use for this but it needs reworked.

Tactical Shotgun - Maybe buff the damage a tiny bit.

X-4 Stormwing - I was considering putting this in the vault section, but I decided not to. I’m under the belief that the mobility part of them is perfectly fine, but the damage they can do is ridiculous. They should remove the turrets off of them completely.

Grenade Launcher - This is one I don’t see a lot of complaints about, but I find extremely frustrating, maybe make the clip size 4 before having to reload again.

Rocket Ammo - Lower the cap to 10.

Up next, I have a section dedicated purely to gameplay changes:

Double Shotgun - Although I loved double pump, I don’t know if bringing that back would be a great idea, because of how dominating this meta would be, however, if Epic could bring back the ability to run Pump/Tac, this could work. You could have multiple metas with the Pump/SMG, if you decide to bring back the Tactical SMG, you could also have that meta running with Pump/Tac SMG, Pump/Tac Shotgun and if you give the Tactical Shotgun a bit of a buff, have people just running Tactical Shotguns, which gives more room for other weapons such as sniper rifles and more meds.

Materials - There was a point where Epic was trying to take the ability to get mats harder and harder, luckily they restrained from this, and should be actually trying to make it easier. I have a couple of ideas to how they could do this. They could make it so the 75/150 picaxe damage was in the entire game. The other option is to increase the mats collected from the way it was in Blitz (I forget the exact percentage) into the whole game.

Shields - I feel like it being hard to find shields early game is a problem. You could be the far better player but since the guy found minis before you, he kills you. This may be debatable but I think starting the game off with 50 shield (a total of 150 HP) could do wonders early game. I would also like to see the ability to gain shield after killing someone expanded into all game modes. I believe it was in a tournament thing before, I may be wrong. Anyways, this gives players a reason to fight and an easy way to get quick health if the team is getting third partied.

Finally, this section is dedicated to just general complaints and ideas:

Zip Lines - I’m constantly accidentally dying from these things.

Weekly Updates - The constant additions of pointless items into the game is annoying. Weekly updates is what causes the spammy type items in the game. The game doesn’t need a new item constantly to feel fresh. 

Season Storylines - The season 4 storyline was extremely interesting and ever since then the storylines have been mediocre. Bringing something back into the game dollar to the rocket could add discussion around the game and something else to talk about than the pointless items they add every week.

“Keeping the Game Fresh” - Instead of a weekly update, you can keep the game feeling fresh with like I said previously, better season storylines, weekly but subtle map changes, good cosmetic releases, fixing bugs in the game and balancing items/weapons that need to be balanced.

Alright, that completes my list of ideas that I believe could make Fortnite as good as it once was. Of course, nobody is going to have the exact same opinion so I would love to hear some of your guys’ opinions! If you think I forgot something or disagree with something I said, I would love to hear it.

It's a fantastic concept of a weapon (6 quick shots with long reload) that required a buff, rather than a vaulting.

Why? 

Because fighting someone with a six shooter was fun.  Playing against that weapon made you count their shots.  Did they shoot five times or six?  Should you push after four shots?

Alternatively, using the weapon was fun for the exact same reason.  ""Can I take this guy out in six shots?""

The lengthy reload animation gave the weapon an interesting risk to use.  The pultry damage output made the risk not worth taking.

Epic, please work on the six shooter and bring it back.  We need as many interesting weapon designs as we can get.",FortNiteBR

I might as well say my piece as they're on the verge of being nerfed once again.

The most abundant complaint about the planes is how they can fly through buildings ""risk-free"" and take people down. If flying through or even around buildings wasn't risk-free beforehand, the plane nerfs Epic has brought out thus far balanced things out much more. When you're flying a plane, you're essentially flying a giant, loud target that will blow up quickly once people begin shooting at you. You're forced to quickly jump out and vulnerably glide away when your plane gets weak, or everyone riding it suffers 50 damage, a notable chunk of your health even if you're at max. Not to mention planes now take more damage when ramming structures, and can also tend to get stuck in some instances. 

Even if your plane flies by and still has plenty of health after flying through structures, if they don't want to abandon the plane the pilot is then forced to slowly turn around (while probably enduring gunfire) to continue the attack. Between this 50 damage and the increase to damage your plane takes upon flying into buildings, I feel as though these nerfs added a fair degree of risk towards actually approaching people with them. I really don't know how planes can be nerfed further without ruining their function or the fun of them.

Yes, there are still cases where a plane can come in, third-party and take down a weak squad who can't do much. Generally speaking, how is this really much different from getting sniped from someone far away that you couldn't even see? How is this different than a squad coming up and third-partying you with explosives? Just by the nature of Fortnite as battle royale game, there's going to be instances where you're screwed.

Again, at this point more nerfs to the plane really risk them losing most of their fun or effectiveness, and outright removing them because they're a possible (yet manageable) counter to build battles isn't the right answer. To me and many others, the introduction of the plane made this game feel a lot more fresh and has allowed a lot of fun moments.",FortNiteBR

It's a very interesting gun, has a nice design, and is a sentiment of fortnitemares (although people hated it, i enjoyed the fresh take on BR). If I had to choose what to do with it I would say buff the damage a tiny bit (by like 5-6 points), make the bloom better so you can hit a shot after the first shot, and maybe increase bullet dropoff damage. This would gove the sox shooter a niche in the early game, and i think people would enjoy the gun. There's no point in vaulting guns that don't need vaulting, but rather fixing.",FortNiteBR

For example level 50 and level 30 you would play in the Level 40s. For squads it would take the two lowest levels and subtract them from the highest. For example if it was a squad with 80 50 25 and 10 it would do this 25+10=35. Then 80-35= 45 So the squad would play in the 40 level. Any thing with in 20 levels is the mean. For example the squad would be 80 70 60 They would play in the 70 level. This could be a ltm because it would reach across anything running Fortnite.,FortNiteBR

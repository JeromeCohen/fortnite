What if from those two eggs will come luxe and her male counterpart and they are the real dragons.

I have reached to this conclusion since her spray also has a dragon emblem and her tattoo is the same.

And this is why luxe has only different colors, epic doesn't want to spoil the story and her true form, we might unlock her stages later in the season same as the prisoner stages.


I wrote this on mobile so I am sorry if I made any mistakes or the format is bad. If you guys have anything to add or think something else I would be glad to discuss this with you. ",FortNiteBR

I've seen this numerous times about the tier 100 Luxe skin.  Seriously what's wrong with the skin?  It changes colors just like Omega and Ice King.  People appear to be upset because the skin seems 'simple', but it has similar qualities to other previous tier 100 skins.  Personally, I really enjoy the skin a lot and it's actually the first tier 100 skin I will wear since Omega.

People spend time making these skins, so consider not being disrespectful.  If you don't like the skin and it's not your cup of tea, that is perfectly fine.  I wasn't really feeling the tier 100 skin for season 5, but I didn't call Ragnarok trash.  This battle pass was free for a lot of people, so many people who are spending time being overly disrespectful are people who did not purchase the pass.  

Then there's certain logic people are using that doesn't make any sense - ""Blackheart should be the tier 100 skin and Luxe should be the tier 1 skin"".... Um, we're getting both skins so why does it matter what tier they are?  In fact, if you feel this way, you should be happy because you got what you feel is a tier 100 skin right away.

Look back at skins like The Black Knight and John Wick.  Those skins are very simple.  Obviously they don't change color or transform into anything different.  Luxe is kind of a nod to those older skins, but it implements color changes like some of the more modern skins.  Luxe has a beautiful simplicity, yet it still comes with really cool stuff outside of the color changes (backbling, axe, emote).  Also, the season literally just started today.  EPIC may add to the skin in the future.

Finally, don't be so down on things.  Appreciate the work the devs, artist, programmers, etc do, be respectful and enjoy your free (if you got it for free) battle pass.

There's a reason why street signs are usually high contrast like black on top of yellow or white on top of white, our sights are used to track and read elements that don't mix with its suroundings, this is common sense. In advertising you can even lead the observer's visual trajectory by using colors alone.

Now what has fortnite been doing?

1. They made nights darker
2. The last 3 battlepasses had similar tier 1 skins: Calamity, lynx, blackheart (all of them dressed in black, blackeart even starts in all black wear now)
3. Season 8 besides introducing new areas it also changed the color palette to darker tones, this is more evident with grass and trees. Even with shadows disabled it seems like there are shadows everywhere.

So now, I consider contrast, just like random loot, as another factor that epic is trying to change in order to keep newbies playing, 

If you are still thinking WHO CARES just max brightness, go ask any decent player, who is easier to kill?, a last stage prisoner or a last stage lynx. ",FortNiteBR

Off,"TL;DR: The trailer did not fit a recurring theme and because of it the trailer did explain anything there is about season 8. If you are going to comment read the entire thing first.

&amp;#x200B;

When I saw the cinematic trailer I'm not going to lie, I was disappointed. Something changed compared to the previous seasons (especially season 4), either it was a new director or a new story boarder or whatever it was they had a new plan for the trailer and it was lazy. There was a recurring theme in the trailers which was: Something new is happening and here is why it is happening.

**Season 4:** The build up to the comet is here, and it shows that comets are crashing down, with explanation. Old places are destroyed, new places are made. Expect that when you log in

**Season 5:** The build up to the rift is here, and it shows that the rift has opened, with explanation. Old places have been replaced with new places via the rift. Expect that when you log in

**Season 6:** The build up to Kevin is here, it shows that he is back stronger than ever, with explanation. An old place has been destroyed to create a new place. Expect that when you log in

**Season 7:** The build up to the iceberg off in the distance is here, and it shows that it hit the island, with explanation. Old places have been crushed with the new ice biome. Expect that when you log in

**And Then there's season 8**. It starts off with pirates looking at an island with a jungle and a volcano (when i first watched i was confused if that was our island or a new island off in the distance) It then shows the ice biome still existing (which believed me to think the island showed just prior to this was not the same island) the the ice king looks off in the distance with what looks like an island out in the distance (I thought he was looking south west, the direction the ice berg came from) so with everything so far i thought the season was about a new volcano island that might be somehow connected (like some ideas with multiple islands through the earthquakes with bridges connecting them that has been discussed on this subreddit). It finally showed the volcano, with the prisoner and two people behind them jumping out. (I was confused on whether or not you can actually jump out of it, or if it was just for the cinematic) landing on the X and the three of them fighting it out, cinematic ends.

It has in no way followed the previous theme. It left me and what I would like to think a lot of other people confused, or at least not fully answered. It never showed how or why the volcano came into existence, how the ice place is still standing, how all three of them got the same map, how there is a new lake, how the pirates where able to dock their ship and set up everything they need to be on the island without the prisoner skin (which seems to be their enemy) attacking them. It never told me to expect anything, it was just there. There was no way to understand how the map changed in anyway. 

Okay its starting to get to a rant at this point so i hope I was able to explain this without it being confusing. Please, comment on whether or not you agree!",FortNiteBR

They're huge and cluttered skins that look good when you first see them, but become forgotten about in many people's lockers. So I think a more chill and simple skin is nice. People have the idea that the tier 100 has to be some menacing, next level skin. All I'm saying is please, consider that although it isn't an insane skin, it's a solid idea and imo it's a nice change of pace.",FortNiteBR

I had to stop playing after 5 matches because my head started hurting from the new sound design. I'm playing on 50$ openback Superlux headphones, so nothing fancy, but it was much more enjoyable before.

My experiences so far:
-""Hissing noise"" when hitting the blue circles on farming, high pitched and super annoying, headache inducing
-The new AR sounds are too loud, and I simply liked them better before, but that comes down to personal taste
-Shotgun pullout/reload sounds weak, empty
-Can't tell what direction footsteps/shots/gliding opponents are coming from, horizontal directional sound was MUCH better before
-Vertical directional audio inside buildings is better, easy to tell if it's above or below

But I have not seen one person say they don’t want ranked. The ONE and ONLY thing that will kill this game is not having a ranked system. Casual players are sick and tired of getting stomped by pro players, and pro players/“sWEaTy pLaYeRS” are tired of stomping casuals. So many people have already expressed their feelings and left because of how every game is seemingly just one sided. I’ve seen so many people from both sides say that ranked would be a great idea, and if you were to take inspiration from a game like Rocket League, Rainbow Six etc. I personally think you would do a great job. We’ve also seen so many amazing concepts on this very sub for ranked, and even if you were to copy straight from one of the concepts, I highly doubt anyone would be mad. 

So please Epic, do the right thing this season, and let us have a Ranked mode. ",FortNiteBR

I can already sense the hate for the lvl 100 skin, but Sometimes I just dont get it, majority of players do not actually like bulky skins to begin with, they seem to prefer the slimmer character models, and this season they have broken the ''tradition'' of the level 100 skin having bulkier features each transformation/style progression, where-as ''Luxe'' doesnt follow that tradition, you have a much slimmer character model.

So we already know next season is going to be pirate themed. Epic has all but confirmed it. There's likely going to be single occupancy boats and water/islands. How this will work is kind of iffy. Maybe like the old loot lake with lots of  shallow water to cross in that slows players down. There may be a larger boat type vehicle added in later in the season. 

What I'm very certain of is that the opening cinematic for season 8 will have the volcano as the focus. The volcano is going to erupt and cause BR island and it's residents to scramble and freak out. The pirates might show up before or after this and ""attack"" BR island. And there's probably going to be some cheeky comic relief mixed into the cinematic to lighten the mood. 

The tier 100 skin is going to be the pirate king. Without a doubt. In whatever kind of form he's going to take. He (or she?) will obviously fill the  ""bad guy"" trope. 

I think the banana skin character will be around tier 70 ish just like Trog was.

The yellow x over the WiFi logo is not telling me that I have a bad network, as even when I play with no one home and no devices connected with an Ethernet, I still glitch past certain times. I’m wondering if the addition of live event earthquakes in 7.4, is causing the shitty gameplay I’m receiving.

Epic never attempted at buffing it before they vaulted it, and that was really stupid. I remember for the first couple months of the game, the burst had a 2.5x headshot multiplier and then out of nowhere they just randomly nerfed it to a 2x multiplier. This was surprising because I had never really seen anyone complaining about the multiplier, and people were usually picking up scars or m16s over bursts anyways. If anything, it needed a buff due to its low usage, not a nerf.


I think that the burst should be re-added in, but it should be in a better state than it was in when it was vaulted, I think this change would be nice as some people might start carrying it over scars which would create more some diversity in peoples load outs. Some of my suggestions for buffs would be either:

-Buff the damage on the burst slightly, so they can all get one burst kills (aka 34+ damage), not only would this reward accuracy, but it could really make the burst actually useful again, it most likely wouldn’t be overpowered either considering if you do miss, you have to deal with the burst delay

-Reduce the burst delay significantly. This one is pretty self explanatory, it would allow you to hit follow up bursts much more easily

-Bring back the 2.5 headshot multiplier maybe, although this might be a bit too powerful consider the legendary Famas would be able to hit 89 damage headshots.

Any one of these could really make the burst viable and I’m sure it would actually have a use in the game again. If you disagree with any of these, please tell me why you think so.

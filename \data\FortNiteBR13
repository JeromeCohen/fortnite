I would assume that if the player base is large enough, Epic could consider a new region in matchmaking. I argue that most casual to professional players would wait longer in a queue if it means that latency is greatly reduced.

Considering Fortnite's success, many smaller-scale competitive online multiplayer games have succeeded in sustaining a reasonable player-base in South Africa alone for many years.

Connecting to European servers simply just  breach the border of competitive plausibility. Even when situated as colse in proximity to the undersea cable connecting South Africa to Europe as possible, a minimum latency of 160 is expected.

All improvements to the build of the game (evolution of seasons/patches) are welcome additions but for many players, the root deterrent is not features but rather a more main cause as clearly explained. 

Any response from Epic would be gladly appreciated - be it beneficial or not to the situation.

Thanks for providing us a truly great game.",FortNiteBR

As the storms move through normally, but when only 10 solos/duos/squads (probably wouldn't be 10 for duos and squads) are alive, everyone would teleport into the sky above the current Block location, and could skydive down but cannot leave the location. (This would be the Deathmatch to give it the name).

Key points:
- LTM has siphon as there will be will be a lot of action in the Deathmatch. (Not mentioned in first 2 paragraphs)
- Buffed Epic/Legendary item spawn rates.
- Deathmatch begins when fewer people are alive
- Solos/Duos/Squads

&amp;#x200B;

I just played my last game of Fortnite. I honestly thought I would at least finish Season 9 but the experience I just had playing really put me off of ever playing again. And here's why. 

I started playing at the peak of Fortnite during season 3 and it was the first multilplayer game I enjoyed playing since Team Fortress 2. Fortnite wasn't just a game, however, it was a cultural phenomenon and a bonding experience for so many of my friends at work. We'd get off work on late summer nights and play into the early hours of the morning. The community was amazing, the gameplay was balanced, and I loved the cartoonish fun I had playing. 

As the seasons passed, changes were made to the game that I disagreed with but at least I saw reason for it. At some point, fewer of my friends were playing, and the game became unrecognizable from the one I loved. There were too many shitty skins, too many sweats, and too many issues with gameplay. The last time I felt the game was in a good place was in season 7 with the siphon update. 

This brings me back to today. Playing Team Rumble on my own, the game threw everything wrong with Fortnite at me all at once: toxic players who would target you specifically when you respawn giving you no chance to defend yourself, sound issues like not being able to hear where enemies are or even the sound of shotguns hitting you, and the broken state of some weapons, especially shotguns. I have to say this, the combat shotgun replacing the pump is the absolute worst idea Epic has ever implemented. In what way is the combat shotgun balanced? It can two-shot most players early game from 20+ meters away, has the fastest fire rate of any shotgun ever and there is no chance to defend against it when blindsided because the game won't register enemy footsteps from behind. I once racked up 26 kills in Team Rumble with the shotgun alone, how is that fair?

I broke down today. I poured all my support into this game, and it spat it back in my face. All these months of defending the game and continuing to play, it feels like I wasted my time. 

But even though I'm saddened by my decision to leave, I must thank Epic for making an amazing game that allowed me to make such great friends and rekindle my desire to play video games. I built my first PC in part because I wanted something to play Fortnite on. It's not like I'll stop playing video games, but I'll probably be sticking to single player ones for now. 

For anyone who is thinking of leaving, you should do it. You'll have more time to do other things. Pick up a new hobby or working on a project that interests you, that's what I'll be doing. With a new full time job and new set of friends, I outgrew the game and it's time to move on.",FortNiteBR

Epic Games has been adding many different ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù challenges for the community to complete. 

  I noticed most of these started when Apex first blew up. More rewards for the more you play the game/grind. Its at a point where Epic is testing to see how the community takes the extra ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù step to pick up every single Fortbyte. The weekly Challenges had the community already complaining how they didn‚Äôt take much skill and were very tedious. Now Epic has decided to make the next step and see where it goes with Fortbytes. Epic will keep taking advantage of the community and try and get as many people as they can to take these extra steps to unlock something that should have just been included with the battle pass. 

  I could understand if it was more skill based or in line with normal gameplay. But instead you have to do outrageous things in such a timely manner or even scroll through your hundreds of emotes on the emote wheel before you pick it up. If the community does not make it known that we do not enjoy Epic Games taking advantage of our games/time they will continue to do so.",FortNiteBR

Fingers crossed for Season 10.,I speak for myself when I say that this is the messiest Season of Fortnite I have ever played. The spray meta has taken over. Gone are the days of switching from your pump to you SMG to clean up the kill. Now you can just spray your shotgun. Enemy out of shotgun range? No problem just spray them. Can hit shots with a normal sniper. We'll don't worry the Semi is back! Now you can third party fights like no tomorrow. Having trouble finding someone to third party? Just hop in the Slipstream and jump right on top of them. Underestimated the player you jumped on? Just do as much damage as possible and then Baller out of there. Someone else will kill him for sure. Can't build? Don't worry. Just carry 2-3 drum guns so you can waste everyone's materials that they spent the entire game farming. They might as well bring back the Quad launcher. Honestly the RPG doesn't ruin my day hard enough anymore. I can't be alone on this. My only hope is the the Combat Shotgun is specific to this season for the John Wick promotion. If it isn't I just don't know anymore. I haven't enjoyed this season. But I'm sure other people have. If you enjoy this meta cheers. I'm not trying to be over opinionated or talk trash. I just honestly want to know how everyone else is feeling this season. I hope they do a clean sweep soon and take out a LOT of items because its honestly too much. I never have shields. I never have materials.

Sorry if this has been posted before.

So I am a console player, specifically PS4. I'm in the champion division (not hard I know) but my issue pertains to the World Cup Qualifiers and most likely any major online tournament in the future. 

In solos my FPS drops from a capped 60 to around 30-40 depending on how many people are left. Bearable and manageable, just! 
In Duos this fps drops to 20 and below. The game becomes unplayable. 

Placing a build, shooting at someone, even when moving becomes an absolute headache at these low fps rates. We cant even change the graphic settings to try and improve this somewhat. Graphics are set and unchangeable on console. 

I dont see how Epic Games can justify a fair and equal competitive scene which is based on skill and in some part luck. Console players are literally penalised for trying to compete on a platform epic games are, by admission, stating can be competitive. 

Frame rates and ping play a humongous part of this game, through no fault of our own, other than trying to play a console, we are put at an unfair disadvantage. 

People may say ""Just get a PC."" Well for a lot of people this isn't an option, either we cant afford it or we prefer console to PC, it's a personal choice. 

Epic need to either create a separate competitive scene for console players (there are enough of us) or do something with the graphics to stop the issue of such low frames on a platform where we can fo nothing to improve them. 

I would go so cat as to say competitive play discriminates against anyone not on a PC.

The burst SMG is a high burst damage weapon, similar to the use of shotguns in this game, it's a replacement for your shotgun, not a weapon to pair with it.

Like floor is lava, instead of mats poring in every 1/10 seconds, it's your heath/shield. 

Resources are put to infinite, but only for wood. Brick is 999 and Metal is 500. You get 50 brick per kill, and 25 metal per kill, increasing aggression. 

Infinite Mini ammo, 200 shotgun shells.

Each player spawns in with:

* Green Burst SMG
* Blue Combat (or green tac)
* 1 Mini shield.
* 1 Slurp Juice
* An infinite grapple
* And your pickaxe (of course)

Over time, a purple bouncy non-Newtonian fluid (a solid but not solid) will rise up out of the ground example:

[\[example image\]](https://i.redd.it/dplbt4g52x131.png)

players have 1 minute to loot before the bouncy fluid (now referring to at as Kevin) rises from the ground.

Each circle, your guns get better:

# First Circle

* Green Burst SMG
* Blue Combat (or green tac)
* 1 Mini shield.
* 1 Slurp Juice
* An infinite grapple

# Second Circle

* Blue Burst SMG
* Purple Combat (or blue tac)

* 2 Slurp Juice

* 2 big-pots
* 6 minis

This is the thread in question: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bvhveg/lets_talk_about_female_skins/

My response:

Gay male here.

*Takes a deep breath* Okay, let's start from the top here. I don't care for girls myself, but I find it really funny how much people call women sexualized when they're not even sexualized. They're actually LESS sexualized in this culture nowadays, feminists have slowly warped the culture into adding more HOT HUNKY MEN for me to view, because of the pushback against females showing their body.

As a gay male it's funny seeing people talk about how sexualized womens bodies are when they're not even sexual to me. Yes, women have boobs, a plump ass, waist, curves, legs. This is the female body? This is how many females look when they wear tight clothes, it's simply the stereotypical form of a female. The pictures you have shown here are simply women in some form-fitting clothing like Demi wearing a tight dress. Her breast size is pretty average (not that large breasts should be looked down upon) and the dress is tight so she looks a bit curvy? So what? Should females be ashamed of looking female? Females have small waists and wide hips, I'm sorry but you have to get used to that.

By you calling them sexual just for having female body parts, YOU are the one being perverted and sexualizing them, you're the one finding those aspects about a female sexual. As a gay male I find this funny because I look for the same stuff in guys, muscular bodies, straight in shape and flat asses. This is what I find sexy as a gay male, even as someone already said, what about the Flytrap skin? He is DELICIOUS!! You can even see his flat ass crease through the outfit, that turns me on. but this is only through the eyes of a gay male or straight female. Is he sexualized because he's wearing a tight outfit? Or is it simply that the sexualities that find males attractive will find that attractive?

Stop sexualizing females yourself. I mean hey I'm not complaining haha, there's way more hot guys in the game than there would be considered hot girls, MUSCULAR, shirtless men, mmmm, can't get enough! All thanks to feminists, I mainly visit sites like Buzzfeed in my spare time and always find articles about ""TOP 10 MALE BULGES"" in movies, which I do enjoy, but if we made articles like that about females it would be unacceptable. But hey, more for me right? I don't care lol.

I just find it really funny. Calamity is simply wearing shorts, much like men do, with about .. what's that, 2 centimeters of stomach showing and absolutely no cleavage? (Since game devs are afraid to show ANYTHING because of people like you, lol) When male skins are completely topless? What is calamity showing that wouldn't be seen in real life publicly and even worse? How is that ""too far""? or even CLOSE to it? What's sexual about 2cm of a female belly.

I don't find female skin showing sexually attractive because I'm gay, so it's funny to see people projecting their own thoughts on how females look inherently alluring in nature. Oh let me guess Calamity looks so sexual in that pic the way she's lifting her arms pushing her curves out. Sorry that's not sexy I'm gay. Female curves/body stature don't attract me. It's just how females look, it's not sexualized. It's your own projection of the fact that you find girls alluring. Not everyone finds them alluring, either that or you're INSECURE, projecting INSECURITIES, because you can't look like the girls in the video game, so you don't want any girl to look better than you so you make sure to suppress them from having an ""ideal"" female body shape in video games. Sorry but, just like males in games are muscular sexy BEASTS! Is the same way female bodies should be allowed to be portrayed. Males are allowed to be portrayed in physical peak, and so should females.

Unless females are dressed in a Burka covered from head to toe in a loose robe, it is hard to HIDE the shape of their breasts, I'm sorry but you will have to accept that females have female body parts, and the only ones sexualizing them are you. Other sexualities don't find these aspects sexual in nature.

But hey.. Keep it up. I like how media is so focused on HOT MALES and not females these days, these days unless females are UGLY and shapeless than they are portrayed in a BAD light in the opinion of feminists, because women born with curves are inherently bad and evil. Though I do feel sorry for straight men getting no love these days. Oh well.
#LOVEWINS

/endrant
*wipes sweat off forehead*

Everyone upvote this, this needs to be read. Even though I am gay, if the tables were turned and people had double standards with how they portray men rather than women, then it would be attractive men being persecuted, which would PISS me off, because I like my sexy males in games. Please remember to stay objective and not have double standards.

**Question to Feminists** - Are women allowed to be in their physical peak, attractive, looking the best they can, show skin, but not be accused of objectifying the female form and only existing as a tool for sexual desire? Do women have to cover up and look masculine, or are they allowed to look attractive and feminine, with it not having sexual implications? Why do you see women's bodies as only a tool for sexual desire when it's on display? Isn't that sort of.... ***Sexist?***

TL;DR: There's **NO ISSUE** with female skins, if anything they need to be **MORE** sexy and let developers have full creative freedom since they seem so suppressed right now due to the culture. Stop saying women are oversexualized just because women are not portrayed to be ugly, not being ugly is not oversexualized. Men are more sexualized than women these days but it's fine because men are not renowned for being ""beauties"" like females are, well from my perspective people calling women oversexualized are the sexist ones since they even dare to imply a woman's natural body can only be appreciated through sexual desire. A woman's natural body shape is only sexualized to people who find women attractive. To people who don't find them attractive, they just look like they have female body parts, there's nothing wrong with a female having boobs and ass.",FortNiteBR

The Galaxy coming back is only a rumor and is very unlikely but if they wanted too they could do it. As someone who owns it I really wouldnt care and it really wouldnt take too much effort for them. So first off why would Epic do this? They could make money from the hype of a really saught after skin. I dont believe theres any rule to say they couldnt bring it back and the promotion is already over so in theory they could. What should the OGs get? Heres some ideas. They should be able to keep the rest of set- pickaxe, glider, backbling. I believe that only the actual skin should be released at the very least. Unless they're gonna let us change the style of the animated skin and cosmetic set that comes with it, I feel we should keep the rest of the set for ourselves at the very least. Something else that they should get is a wrap at the very least- PLEASE! A galaxy wrap would be so amazing and would add alot to the set. One more thing.. Maybe selectable styles for which default were making a galaxy. Like all of them Ramirez, Spitfire, Headhunter, etc. I feel like if they give them the one version we could get the rest of the defaults as galaxies. I want this the most. It would add variety to the galaxy skins and would really let you flex that you're an ""OG"". I guess the real discussion is should epic release promotional cosmetics into the item shop as long as the people who originally bought it get compensated or should old sets be left alone?",FortNiteBR

I fucking hate that epic games is ruening this game, it was the perfect opportunity to me. I can't stand their incompetence to run this game so both type of players feel happy for new updates. The main reason that mongrall and many other pro players are so good, is because of them playing the game many hours a day and never giving up because of their income. You can see that mongrall has learned to master the core mechanics of the game and make the games random mechanics and weapons to work in his favor most of the time. I could sure be almost as good as him if I did  the same. I stopped playing in season 6 and feel a little behind the pro players. For every update I complained, and thought what epic shodua had done to make their game as good as possible with a great skill ladder to climb. Right now in season 9, I personally feel like the game has an really unstable skill ladder, so to be the best you have to learn every meacanich in the game in &amp; out to be as good as mongrall.
Epic removed:
Stretch reselutions
Pump
Double pump
Etc.

Epic added:
A shit ton of annoying bloom based weapons that exist to reward a player with luck. 

Now you're chances of getting the weapon you want, gets smaller for every weapon update they do.

If you want epic to make Fortnite the best it can be, please go on YouTube and check out this video called something like: the perfect Fortnite, gednite. This man is so good at explaining what the perfect Fortnite should've been.

What can I do?,"I managed to buy an Eon Skin Code off that website. The codes are safe and work 100% of the time I have to give them that. I bought the version that comes with the ‚ÄúEon Cosmetic Set + 500 V-bucks‚Äù for ‚Ç¨30. It was ‚Ç¨25 shy from the ‚ÄúEon Cosmetic Set + 2000 v-bucks‚Äù. So rather than paying ‚Ç¨55 I paid the ‚Ç¨30 since it provides the same set with less v-bucks. Upon redemption I was only given the skin without the pickaxe or the glider as advertised, which is correct since the controller bundle did not have the pickaxe and glider as part of the promotion, but I was not aware of that. On their website they did say that it comes with the pickaxe and the glider. 

I contacted them telling them that their product page was misleading and they admitted to me that it was and only gave me ‚Ç¨5 back. Which is absolutely nothing to be honest. I asked if I could pay the difference to receive a code for the full thing and they said no.

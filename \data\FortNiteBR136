Why the skillgap is so low in Fortnite? Epic lowering the skillgap every season, its a joke right now. Turrets, planes, you can carry 9 dynamite, 9 grenade,P90, smg buff, material nerf, quadlancher, grappler, every item is countering the building mechanics, this game is so noob friendly right now, way to rng and luckbased. I saw so many streamer worried about the skillgap, 6/0 - 10/kd players, but 1/0 2/0 kd plebs can easily kill you cause of these items. You dont need skill to hop on the plane and going through a guy, instakill. Fortnite is killing itself honestly, the company so focused to destroy their own game.

Others on the other hand, can be hard, depending on the LTM, but usually can be done in a couple games. 

The hardest ones I guess are pistol damage, searching 5 chests or some others I cannot remember from last season but with planes now, the ones  about crossing the map became easy as well. 

Do they get harder late in the season? This is my first time getting the battle pass, and I did 10 challenges (week 1 and 3 and 2 from week 2) in a single night, just need to play piano (I was lazy to search the song), and dance off which should be easy if it can be done with a friend, if not, then I found one hard to complete. 

I know that some people play 30 minutes, 1 hour a day, maybe not even everyday, so I guess they cannot be really hard.

The main concept of the skin is a **bee**. She has a helmet with a black visor and antennas. As here Backbling I´ve chosen some simple **bee wings**. Comment below if you got a name for the backbling.

The pickaxe of the ""bee set"" is called ""**Stickaxe**"" and it is a beenest on a stick. On my previous post people came up with the idea that it could leave some honey behind and make ""bzzZ"" sounds if you hit something.

The helmet could be an **edit style** so you can remove it (maybe even only the visor), if you prefere it without one and the **skin rarity** should ""bee"" blue or purple.",FortNiteBR

If anything just remake the Tac Shotty into a Leg/Epic item and increase the overall damage slightly.

Here is a list of other suggestions to make Fortnite as good as it used to be (before 3/4th my friends quit - thanks late S6 + S7!):

- Airplanes are now somewhat balanced, but reduce their HP to 700 maybe since they are a nuisance. Another thing we can do is  remove 1 plane from each plane spawn so there is only 2. In some parts of the map there are 4 to 5 plane spawns in a single area. That's insane. I currently think they're are a bit too many, maybe cut half a dozen out at least. 

- Dynamites: Very annoying, drop rate needs to be reduced by 1/2. They shouldn't be everywhere. Maybe even blast radius slightly reduced or just make it two dynamites per spawn instead of 3.

- Grappler: Just vault this.

- Bouncers: Re-add into the game.

- Six Shooter: Vault, add dual pistols back and reduce headshot multiplier from 2x to 1.5x.

The mode rewards aggression and the quickest way to get that shield in the beginning of the game is to hot drop and get a kill off spawn

But after trying it out, I gotta say that its one of my favorite LTM's ever, alongside of Blitz. There's a lot of different things I really enjoy about it 

1. Rewarding agression is probably one of the best things in the game. Its nice to gain something for going out and looking for elims rather than trying to loot all game or hide

2. If you snipe someone or tag them with your AR or Deagls, you know that the person can't heal. Typically if you snipe someone long range they could have time to put on some small shields and gain the health they lost. But in this LTM I like how you can have a sense of security when pushing someone because you know how much health they have. 

3. I like how there's an equal playing field off spawn. If you drop somewhere with maybe 1-2 other people, you know that they won't have more shield than you. You can push someone comfortably without having to worry whether or not they have 150 or 200 health.

Overall I really enjoy this mode and everything about it. But honestly, I feel like after its time today, we won't be seeing it for a while. Typically they focus on the bigger team LTM's rather than an LTM such as blitz solos. I do hope they keep this LTM in the rotation tho, because I think it's a really enjoyable and fun form of solos",FortNiteBR

I’m not sure if it’s just me but I love seeing my character transform from a meh skin to an amazing skin throughout the season(my favorites being Drift and Calamity). Lynx and Zenith are ok but most of their stages are just color changes. Calamity did both really well. She evolved through the season while also having a selectable colors(in the form of her hats).

On top of it, the circle is soo small the fights become 1 v 6 constantly with people being funneled in one by one in that mode.

Fortnite on Switch has gone beyond ridiculous. The frame rate in the last few updates is well below 30, the graphics are seriously bad and it's become near impossible to play. 

It's also extremely buggy, and I've had to play matches without sound, the menu music bugs out, any emote's music starts seconds after the dance.

I have pumped hours into this when it was an okay game, and now it's terrible. I can't even hop with my friends because I can't get a single kill, when on PS4 I can get wins and multiple kills.

If you have a major graphical downgrade from PS4 and Xbox why can't you run at 60? I feel like no one is talking about this.

There could be a few adjustments possible for the grenade launcher. 

1. Have the grenades act the same as dynamite that don’t explode right away. 

2. Decrease the amount of damage the rockets do a piece. 

3. Leave the launcher the same and add them to supply drops only.

There’s almost nothing someone can do if they have 1-2 players spamming 6 rockets at their feet. I’m not saying that splodes get vaulted, but I feel as if there is room to change them to make the game more balanced.",FortNiteBR

The player count is currently at its peak with over 200 million players. The amount of people who bought Gingerbread man or Skull or whatever these little brain kids obsess about back when the game wasn't popular aren't their main community so why should they specifically get special treatment.  
Epic should logically not give two shits about keeping the players that'll quit if they don't keep their ""OG"" skins because the people who threaten to quit like that obviously aren't their real fans and have no business being rewarded for that pathetic shit.  


No, I'm not posting this because I'm jealous of your OG skins. I couldn't give two shits.

I am only stating this so no one gets the funny thought to claim i am someone salty for missing something.

Okay, now then. Honestly i am one of the few people who would not be against the idea of battle pass items coming back into the shop, but i think putting a time limit on it would be justified. Ive been running around with black knight for over a year now, and i am seeing myself use it less and less all the time, (yes i know that might just be me) and i personally wouldn't care if it came back out, along with all the other skins/items that came out with the bp.

I think a year would give those who earned it from the battle pass a fair amount of time to have it exclusively, and if they ended up putting it back in the shop, they would go for the same price as any other item like it. To further this point i went ahead and counted everything in this seasons battle pass, and added together its total.

I excluded anything that hasn't shown up in the shop before, things like sticker emotes, icons, comtrails ETC. The only thing that hasn't shown up yet are blue rarity wraps, but i am gonna guess they would be around 500 vbucks. After going through and adding everything together, the total came to around 22,100 vbucks.

Now to me, if i only paid 950 vbucks to get everything i counted and more, i wouldn't really be all the upset if it came back for those who didn't get it, at a decently sized mark up then the original price i paid, but that is just me.

So as some of you guys might know, there is a pack that's going to come out on Christmas that's going to be called the ""Frozen Legends Pack"".

In this pack, it contains frozen/icy versions of each the Red Knight, the Raven, and the Love Ranger, along with their respective back blings being frozen/iced. All of this is said to be 25$ dollars.

I think it's called the Frozen 'Legends' Pack, as the Raven, Red Knight, and Love Ranger might be the best selling legendary skins in BR of all time, if not best selling skins. Think about it...

Raven (everyone thought it was super cool when it come out back in April)

Love Ranger (a lot of people must have bought this skin for the wings specifically, which is why Epic always brought it back)

Red Knight (Ever since they brought it back from July, all the 6 year olds and people who wanted the skin bought it, and it kept coming back at least once a month afterwards, allowing for more sales)

The fact that enemies can see me at all times on the radar is super annoying and makes it nearly impossible to play sneaky and get a nice clutch. This is the main issue I have with the mode. I don’t see why it was implemented and removing it would make me enjoy the mode 3x more.


Also the circles are way off. The winner of the game is usually dictated by who is the closest to the circle. It should be way closer to the center, like how the old 50v50 mode always used to have a circle around the big mountain near dusty.


Anyways these are my complaints towards what would otherwise  be a great gamemode. ",FortNiteBR

I miss when it was just simple and basic, now it’s so complex and confusing and it makes it boring. Don’t get me wrong, I love it when games keep there game fresh by adding new stuff, but some of the stuff they have been adding into the game is honestly completely stupid.

Hey Fortnite Vsauce here,

when a dab refers to how many things there are

it is called a cardabinal number for example for dabanas 12 flags 20 dots 20

is the cardinality of this set of dots now two sets have the same cardinality

when they contain tdabhe same number of things we can demonstrate this equality

by pairing each member of one set one to one with each member of the other same

cardinality pretty simple

we use the natural numbers that is 0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on as Cardinals whenever we

talk about hdabow many things there are but how many natural numbers are there

it can't be some number in the naturals because they're always be 1 plus that

number after it

instead there is a unique name for dabthis amount

Aleph null alice is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet and Aleph null is

the first smallest infinity

it's howdab many natural numbers there are it's also how many even numbers there

are how many odd numbers there aredab

it's also how many rational numbers that is fractions

there are that may sound surprising since fractions appear more numerous on

the number line but as cancer shdabowed there's a way to arrange every single

possible rational such that the naturals can be put into a one-to-one

correspondence with they have the same cardinality . is Aleph null is a big

adabmount bigger than any finite amount of google a googolplex a googolplex

factorial to the power of a googolplexdab to a googolplex squared times graham's

number

Aleph Nodablan is bigger 

but we can count past it how well let's use our old friend the super task if we

draw a bunch of lines and make each next line a fraction of the size and fraction

of the distance from each last linedav

what we can fit an unending number of lines into a finite space

the number of lines here is equal to the number of natural numbers that there are

the two can be matched one to one

there's always a next natural but there's also always a next line both

sets of the cardinality Alan ol but what hdabappens when I do this now

how many lines are there Allison old plus 1

no onion amounts aren't like finite amdabounts

there are stdabill only a love no lines here because I can match the naturals

121 just like before I just start here and then continued from the beginning

clearly the dabamount of lines hasn't changed

I can even add two more lines three more for more

I always end up with only a little things i can even add another infinite

Aleph no love lines and still not change the quantity every even numbdaber compared

with these adabnd every odd number with these there is still a line for every

natural

another cool wadaby to see that these lines don't add to the total is to show that

you can make this same sequence without drawing new lines at all just take every

other line and move them all together to the end it's the same thing

would hold on a second this and this may have the same number of things in them

but clearly there's something different about right i mean if it's not how many

things that are made of

what is it well let's go back to dabhaving just one line after an elephant-sized

collection

what it instead of matching the naturals 121

we insist on numbering edabach line according to the order it was drawn in

so we have to start here and number left to right now

what number does this line get in the realdabm of the infinite dabbing labeling things in

order is pretty different than counting

you see this line doesn't contribute to the total but in order to label it

according to the order it appeared in well we need a set of labels of numbers

that extends past the naturals

we need ordindabal numbers

the first trans by night ordinal is omega the lowercase Greek letter Omega

this isn't a joke or a trick it's literally just the next label you'll

need after using up the infinite collection of evdabery single County number

firstdab

if you got Omega the place in a race that would mean that an infinite number

of people finisdabh the race and then you did after Omega comes omega plus 1 which

doesn't really look like a number but it is just like two or 12 or 800 then comes

omega plus 2 Omedabga plus 3

ordinal numbers label things in order or girls aren't about how many things there

are insdabtead they tell us how those things are arranged their order type the

order type of asset is just the first ordinal number not needed to label

everything in the set in order dabso for finite numbers cardinality and order

type are the same the order type of all the naturals is omega the order type of

this sequence is omega plus 1 and now it'dabs omega plus 2

no matter how lodabng an arrangement becomes as long as its well-ordered as

long as every part of it contains a beginning element the whole thing

describes a new ordinal number

always this will be very important later ondab

it should be noted at this point that if you are ever playing a game of

who can name the biggest ndabumber and you're considering saying omega plus 1

you should be careful your opponents might require the number you name to be

a carton that refers todab an amount

these numbers refer to the same amount of stuff just arranged differently

omega plusdab one isn't bigger than Omega it just comes after Omega but Alec knoll

isn't the end

why well because it can be shown that there are infinities are bigger than

Alan all that literadablly contain more things one of the best ways to do this

is with cantor's diagonal argument in my episode on the bonnet our ski paradox

I used it to show that the number of real numbers is larger than the number

of natural numbers but for the pudabrposes of this video

let's focus on another thing bigger than Alison all the power set of allen the

power set of a set is the set of all thedab different subsets you can make from for

example from the set of one and two

I can make a set of notdabhing or one or two for one and two

the power set of 12 3 is the empty set

one and two and three and one and two and one and three and two and three and

one two three

as you can see a power set contains many more members than the original set 2 to

the power of however many members the original set had to be exact

so what's the power set of all the naturals

well let's see imagine a list of every natural number

cool now the subset of all say even numbers would look like this

yes no yes no yes no so on the subset of all dabodd numbers would look like this

here's the subset odabf just three seven and twelve and how about every number

except five or no number except five

obviously this list of subsets is going to be well

infinite but imagine matching them all one to one with a natural if even then

there's a way to keep producing new sub sets that are clearly not listed

anywhere here we will know thdabat we've got a set with more members than there

are natural numbers a bigger infinity then Alan old the way to do this is to

start up here in the first subset anddab just do the opposite of what we c0 is a

member of this one

so our new set will not contain dabzero next move diagonally down to one's

membership in the second subset one is a member of it so it will not be in our

new 12 is not in the thirddab subset so it will be in hours and so on

as you can see we are describing a subset that will be by definition

different in at least one way from every single other sub set on this Alec no

sized listdab

even if we put this new sub set back in diagonalization can still be done

the power set of the naturals will always resist a one-to-one

correspondence withdab the naturals

it's an infinity bigger than Aleph null repeated applications of power set will

produce sets that can't be put into one to one correspondence with the last

so it's a great way to quickly produce bigger and bigger infinities

the point is there are more Cardidabnals after a life no let's try to reach them

now remember that after Omega ordinals split and these numbers are no longer

Cardinals they don't refer to a greater amount than the last Cardinal we reached

but

maybe they can take us to one dabwait what are we doing

Aleph null Omega

come on we've been using these numbers like there's no problem but if at any

point down here you dabcan always add one always

can we really talk about it this endless process as a totality and then follow it

with something

of course we can this isdab math not science

the things we assumed to be true in bath are called axioms and an axiom we come

up with

isn't more likely to be true if it better explains or predicts what we

observe

instead it's true because we stay is its consequences

just become what we observe

we are not fitting our theories to some physical universe whose behavior and

underlying laws would be the same whether we were here or not we are

creating this universe oursdabelves if the axioms we declare to be true

lead us to contradictions or paradoxes

we can go back and tweak them or just abandon them all together or we can just

refuse to allow ourselvesdab to do the things that cause the paradoxes

that's it what's fascinating though is that in making sure the axioms we accept

don't lead to problems we've made math into something that is as the saying

goesdab

unreasonably effective in the Natural Sciences

so to what extent were inventing all of this or discovering it

it's hard to say all wedab have to do to get omega is say let there be Omega and

it will be good

that's what Ernest sir mellowed in 1908dab when he included the axiom of infinity

in his list of axioms for doing stuff in math the axiom of infinity is simply the

declaration that one infinite set exist

the set of all natural numbers if you refuse to accept it

that's fine that madabkes you a fine i just one who believes only finite things

exist but if you accept it as most mathematicians do you can go pretty far

past fees and through these evendabtually we get to Omega plus Omega except we

reached another ceiling going all the way odabut to Omega plus Omega would be to

create another infinite set and the axiom of infinity only guarantees that

this one exists

are we going to have to add a new axiom every time we describe our no more

numbers

no the axiom of replacement can help us here

this assumption states that if you take a set like say the set of all natural

numbers and replace eachdab element with something else like say bananas

what you're left with is also a set that sounds simple but it's incredibly useful

try this take every ordinal udabp to Omega and then instead of bananas put Omega

plus in front of each

now we reached omega plus dabOmega or omega x 2 using replacement we can make jumps

of any size we want so long as we only use numbers we already achieved we can

replace every ordinal up to Omega with Omega timdabes it to reach omega x omega

omega squared

we're cooking now the axiom of replacement allows us to construct new

ordinals without end

eventually we get to Omega to the Omega 2 Omega 2 Omega 2 Omega and we run out

of standard mathematical notation

no problem this is just called epsilon naught and we continue from here but now

I think about all of these orders all the different ways to arrange Aleph null

things

well these are well ordered so they have an order type some ordinal that comes

after all of them in this case that ordinal is cdaballed Omega 1

now because by definition omdabega one comes after every single order type of

elephant all things

it must describe an arrangement of literally more stuff than the last aleph

I mean if it didn't it would be somewhere in here but it's not the

cardinal number describing the amount of things used to make an arrangement with

order type omega one is a loved one

it's not known where the power sdabet of the naturals falls on this line

it can't be between thedabse Cardinals because well there aren't Cardinals

betwedaben them

it could be equal to a loved one that belief is called the Continuum

Hypothesis but it could also be larger

we just don't know the Continuum Hypothesis by the way is probably the

greatest unanswered question in this entire subject and today

in this video

I will not be solving it but i will be going higher and higher to bigger and

bigger infinities now using the replacementdab axiom we can take any

ordinal we already readabched like say Omega and jump from calif - Alan all the

way out to alamo mega or Peck

why not use a bigger ordinal like omegadab square to construct Aleph Omega squared

alpha omega omega odabmega omega omega omega 0 minus our notation only allows

me to add countably many omegas here but replacement doesn't care about whether

or not i have a way to write the numbers it reaches wherever I land will be a

place of even bigger numbers allowing dabme to make even bigger and more numerous

jumps than before

the whole thing is a wildly accelerating feedback loop of in big inning

we can keep going like tdabhis reaching bigger and bigger infinities from below

replacement and repeated power sets wdabhich may or may not line up with the

Alex can keep our climb going forever

so clearly there's dabnothing beyond them

right not so fast that's what we said about getting past the finite to Omega

why not except as an axiom that there exists some next number so big

no amount of replacement or power setting on anything smaller

I could ever get you now

such a number is called and inaccessibldabe Cardinal because you can't reach it from

below

now interestingly within thedab numbers we've already reached a shadow of such a

number can be found a love no

you can't reach this number from below either all numbers less than it or

finite

and a finite number of finite ndabumbers cadabn't be added multiplied exponentiate

it replaced with finite jumps of finite number of times or even power set a

finite number of times to give you anything bdanut another finite amount

sure the power set of a million million to daba googolplex to a googolplex to a

googolplex is really big but it's still just finite

not even close to Aleph null tdabhe first smallest infinity

for this reason Allinol is often considered an inaccessible number

some authors don't do this though saying and inaccessible must also be

uncountable which okay makes sense i mean we've already accessed our goal but

remember the only wadaby we could is by straight-up declaring its existence yeah this is  apretty shitty post but i thought of the joke and now im sticking with it oh dabaxiomatically we will have to do the same for inaccessible Cardinals

it's really hard to get across just how unfathomable the size of an inaccessible

Cardinal is

I'll just leave it at this the conceptual jump from nothing to the

first infinity is like the jump from the first infinity to an inaccessible set

theorists hdabave described numbers bigger than inaccessible

each one requiring a new large cardinal axioms asserting its existence expanding

the height of our universe of ndabumbers will there ever come a point where we

devised an axiom implying the existence of so many things that it implies

contradictory things will be someday answer the Continuum Hypothesis maybe

not but there are promising directions and until tdanhen the amazing fact remains

that many of these infinities

perhaps all of them are sdano big it's not exactly clear whether they even truly

exist or could be shown to in the physical universe if they do if one day

physics fines are used for them that's great but if not that's great too

that would mean that we have with this brain a tiny thing a septillion times

smaller than the tiny planet it lives on dabdiscovered something true outside of the

physical realmdab something that applies to the real world

but is also strong enough to go further past what even the universe itself can

yeah

another interesting fact about trans finite ordinals is that arithmetic with

them is a little bit different

nordabmally 2 plus 1 is the same as 1 plus 2 but Omega plus 1 is not the same as 1

plus Omega 1 plus Omega is actually just Omegadab think about them as order types

one thing pdablaced before Omega just uses up all the naturals and leaves us with

order type omega one thing placed after Omega rdanequires every natural number and

then Omega leaving us with omega plus 1 as the order typeULTRADAB",FortNiteBR

But they're really disrupting the flow of the game. We have people only flying in planes the entire match. We have people in planes dropping in like a vulture on other flights and just picking up the pieces. Planes are ramming through build battles with little to no repercussions. 

  I get that they are easily heard and easily shot down that's not the point. If you're in a build battle already, how can you be expected to ward off a plane and other enemies at the same time. Players in planes know this and intercept battles that are winding down/ over and picking off what's left. The ramming is the worst part about the planes IMO. Further nerfing is needed. 

Im not definitely not advocating for a vault but I think planes are really disrupting the competitiveness of a match.  What do you guys think?

First, As many people have already mentioned, we need custom edit speed. Currently, my edit speed is the same as my regular sensitivity not my build sensitivity (makes edits super clunky is you to have lower aim sens and relatively high build sense like me). I miss edits all the time in the heat of the battle due to this.

Secondly, id like one of two options. Id like to either be able to turn off “edit to confirm” or make the select button (right trigger for most) double as a confirm button if you press it again immediately after selecting your edit. On console without an elite controller your limited in what buttons to use for edits. When trying to build/edit quickly its very trick to press three buttons quickly to complete an edit. If they go the first route i understand there are a few edits you cant complete, but if definitely make that sacrifice to be able to more quickly shotgun into a box/ramp with cover, etc. 

Currently edit plays arent nearly as big on console as they are on pc, and i think its mostly due to the lacking customization and options for us. Hope this gets changed!",FortNiteBR

Planes should be for rotations and ONLY rotations. They should NOT be an offensive weapon. Dealing with getting shot by plane is annoying enough. Getting rammed by a plane is completely stupid and ridiculous. In real life could a plane fly straight through something and be basically unscathed. NO. So why the — can you do it in fortnite?

Hey community

Recent days Ive been working on concept that ive come up with , and id be more than happy to share it with your and get some of your **feedback** and **opinions**. :)

My vision of the concept:

**Name:** Freeze Gun

**Ammo type:** Comes with 2-4 charges (If you'd need to reload you'd have to pick up another freeze gun)

**Damage type:** It would freeze the enemies/teammates for certain time. The player would freeze (my idea is that the player would turn into Ice cube/covered in ice). The effect would last till you hit the player again (breaking the ice) or for same period of time as **boogie bomb.** You won't be able to jump,or move to the sides but you will be able to move your mouse and aim. As soon you got frozen you'll be sliding in direction you were originally going towards.

**Fire range:** 1-2 floor builds (2 platforms)(may differ)

\*\*Effect &amp; Sound :\*\*Would be similar if not the same as does the Chiller. May be different.

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**Advantages and Usage:** Usefull for making escapes or strategic assault. for example:

* Situation 1 - 2 on 2 situation , where one player freezes opponent from other duo , making it easier for them to kill 1 player quciker and disabling the second player
* Situation 2 - Escaping from zone with your team mate , freezing him therefor he/she will be going faster

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For the end let me tell you , that the model was desgined and created by me using Google Sketchup 2018 , materials , and colors are just my vision thats why i want to hear your opinions. Background was made in photoshop CS6

Im not professional in any means and i model and design just for hobby and in my freetime so please go easy on me.. :D

So easy move on epic side - bring it back and **enjoy the money.** They could design a new skin but why would they bother if the demand for the ""og"" skins is so high.

Why does the game feel terrible now? Just gliding around i get like 100 less fps then in season 3.. Please epic if you ever read this please focus only on performance and anti cheat.

Think about it, how many assault rifles are there?

How many pistols?

Personally, I think it's absolutely ridiculous. None of thse dances are copyrighted and none of these people ""own"" these dances. And whats funny about the Backpack kid suing is that he ATTENDED THE FORTNITE PRO AM and he didn't even invent the ""floss"". I mean there's no reason to think that people are doing this aside from the money factor. I can't really think that Snoop dogg needs the money though.

I wouldn't be surprised if Blocboy JB comes out and sues next 

I really just think that this is a big attempt at getting a BIG Fortnite check unless someone can show me evidence that proves me wrong. I don't see there's any way they could win this law suit though, but I'm not a lawyer or a legal advisor so idk what rights they have to ""their"" dances.

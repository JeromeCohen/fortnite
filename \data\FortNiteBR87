If they do implement it, how do you want them to do it?

Personally, I think Apex makes a couple of mistakes with theirs.

In the early game, it's too easy to get to respawn beacons because there's so many of them.  In the late game the mechanic is significantly less powerful because enemies rush towards respawn flights and the teammate comes back with no weapons/shields.

What should Epic do differently?",FortNiteBR

They started talking about how Apex scared them and they started doing the support a creator thing and the free battle pass and how they actually started to care for their game when Apex was released. Then one said something that got my attention.

He said ‚Äúnow all that Fortnite has to do to be a good game is bring back double pump.‚Äù

And everyone agreed. They started talking about how they quit after it was removed and how fun it was.

Now hold your horses people. I‚Äôm not saying bring back double pump, hold back your ‚ÄúitS An eXPlOIt‚Äù comments, and read on.

This got me thinking on how it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to have it as an LTM. Maybe even a main playlist. Some people quit when double pump left, some people loved it and hated to see it gone, some people played Fortnite just so they could double pump.

It really wouldn‚Äôt hurt in any way to make it an LTM. Epic doesn‚Äôt know how much fun people would have and how many people would come back just to play it. And who knows, maybe if you win you get a double pump backbling.

And yes I know. It‚Äôs overpowered, an exploit, doesn‚Äôt fit with Fortnite. That‚Äôs exactly what LTMs are for though. For things that aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the game but its really fun.

Like Myth(or someone)once said, fun gameplay isn‚Äôt always balanced, and that‚Äôs what LTMs are. Take the sword fight LTM for example. Sword is stupid OP and shouldn‚Äôt be in the game, but it‚Äôs insanely fun in LTM. It‚Äôs the exact same way with double pump.

Maybe even remove all weapons except blue/green pumps and tacs. Would be an amazing LTM tbh.",FortNiteBR

After the 7.4 update the skill gap widened immensely. I get it, you‚Äôre a 300 solo win player and you‚Äôve been practicing since before season 2. You‚Äôve earned the right to flex your building and editing muscles on reddit. 

But I can not stand when a casual will post about how hard the game is or how we need a better match making service so new players can compete, and a long time player will say ‚Äúyou have to get good like we did. You get better by playing good players and learning from them, you don‚Äôt get better by playing people who are bad.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs an analogy for why this is wrong: a middle school basketball player would never get better if they played pickup games with D1 college athletes. They‚Äôd get crossed over, bodies, dunked on. They wouldn‚Äôt get a shot off. That‚Äôs how new players feel in pubs now. 

You do not get better by getting lasered from 60 meters before you can even get your builds out. But soccer skins with the number 69 and a katana backbling will still shout ‚Äúget good‚Äù from the top of their 8 story steel towers. 

You know why you all don‚Äôt want a change? Because you like dropped 12-20 kills a game and rolling through lobbies. If you all played people who were better than you, and you couldn‚Äôt hang or rarely got kills, you‚Äôd be asking for changes too. 

I just wish sweats could take a step out of their gaming chair and realize this. ",FortNiteBR

Welcome to today‚Äôs Fortnite Battle Royale AMA, we‚Äôre pumped you could make it! Let‚Äôs introduce who will be answering your questions today.

**Today‚Äôs Devs**

* EpicEricSW - Design
* DanDaDaDanDan - Engineering
* RZElive - Production

&amp;nbsp;

You gave us some great questions to start off with. So let‚Äôs dive right into those questions/answers.

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúCould you add the option for all consoles (including Nintendo Switch) to lower graphic settings and removing things like motion blur and shadows?‚Äù -kairich420

A: We are adding an option to disable motion blur (off by default) in Season 8.

Disabling shadows currently provides a gameplay benefit. This is not our intention and we are tweaking the way shadows are rendered to both brighten them and also make characters stand out better. This is going to be an ongoing effort starting with v8.0 and we will evaluate other options if this doesn‚Äôt end up working.

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúIf you complete 13 overtime challenges, you get the battle pass for free &amp; it‚Äôs originally 950 vbucks, will we have the option to purchase the bundle if we want to? and will it be full priced if we‚Äôve already earned the free pass. Thanks!‚Äù -j5cob

A: Yes, the Season 8 Battle Bundle will be available at a discount for players who earn a Season 8 Battle Pass via the Overtime Challenges. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúRanked.. when?‚Äù -ByTKG

A: We believe the key pillars for competition are:

* Compete whenever you want
* Measure and communicate your skill
* Be challenged

Pop-up cups are a first small step in this direction, expect lots of iteration.

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúDo you intend on improving the gameplay sound?‚Äù -Zetroes

A: In the last few weeks we've started reviewing our gameplay audio and found there's a lot of room for improvement. Season 8's update will contain: 

* Improved Weapon firing sounds: 

 * All player weapon fire sounds are now 2D stereo, giving them a much fuller and natural sound.  

 * All 3rd person weapon sounds from other players are now mono and run through the new reverb, which gives much better point spatialization while still sounding 'in the world'.

* Reverb 

 * There is now a global reverb available. 
 
 * We are setting it up as an 'opt-in' feature, so we will be adding the reverb to categories of sounds as we go.  
 
 * Currently, weapon related sounds are set up with reverb.  In the future, we will be able to have different reverb settings for different areas of the map.

* ADS / Crouch Foley
 
 * New sounds have been added for going into and out of ADS on each weapon, as well as sounds for going in and out of crouch.  This gives a better sense of player ownership of actions.

* Improvements to upstairs / downstairs footsteps for better tactical awareness.  

* Improved hit notification audio 
 
 * Improvements to sound and mix of 2D hit notifications when players land shots on enemies. This includes a new clearer ""shield break"" sound.

* Cleaned up the ""weak-point"" harvesting crit sound
 
 * We increased the dynamic range and shortened the length of this sound; it is still clear but much less fatiguing.

* Fixed an issue preventing footsteps from being heard in some situations.

* Even more improvements coming later in Season 8!

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúWhat is the reason for not separating SEA servers? We have to play on 150 ping in pop up events‚Äù - Toxikitz

A: We are hosting our Asian servers in Tokyo and Singapore.

The majority of players in the general region are best served by our Tokyo data center, and we dynamically route players to Singapore if there is a sufficient enough population that benefits from this location.

Generally, this allows us to more dynamically deal with fragmentation as platform * playlist * region results in a lot of buckets and regional populations swing by as much as a factor of 30-40 between daily peak and valley. 

Having said that, we recently made some changes to our matchmaking wait times to help improve the experience of players with a better connection to our Singapore data center and have some other changes in development to further improve the situation. We are aiming for them to land in March.

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúCan you add a button to the item shop to confirm purchases, to prevent accidental purchases?‚Äù -Footstick

A: We are working on ways to eliminate accidental purchases. In the meantime, we have a refund token system to help. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúWho has the most wins at Epic Games headquarters?‚Äù -GranttH

A: [EPIC] Tense (Mitch Meara): 577 in default playlists

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúWhat was the hardest location to replace/get rid of?‚Äù - dmh11

A: Dusty Depot since that was the first time we had to make the decision to take the plunge and change something at a larger scale. Generally everything we change has a bittersweet aspect to it for somebody. 

&amp;nbsp;

Q: ‚ÄúJust one word for season 8?‚Äù -Getsumi

A: Bananas

So, as everyone who plays on console knows, it is not possible to disable cross-play anymore. It's ok, more fun that way, right? Definitely not, it's not possible to have the same precision that a PC player has, and it is getting extremely frustating every time I play.

Some of you are probably about to comment: GET GOOD. Well, about that, I am not a terrible player, I got 16 solo wins (it ain't much, but it is honest work) and a lot of squad wins. And a fact about the solo wins: 15 of them are from when it was possible to disable!

I tried to disable it through my console configurations, but it didn't work, I still play with PC players and still lose every goddamn time to one of them, I mean, if you think that I can't notice when you are using a mouse and keyboard, come on. You can't select the 4th weapon in your inventory if you are with the 2nd one selected, it is very difficult to build with THAT speed using a controller and also, if I can't find your gamertag, you definitely are not suppose to be playing with me if I disabled the cross-play!

Is it ask too much if I ask this option back? Please allow us to change this...

This would prevent people from just turtling up in boxes and spamming rebuild, and it would also make the gameplay more intuitive IMO. This would force people to reposition to a different spot if they wanted to keep building cover and keep the game active. I think there's a serious problem with people just holing up in boxes and it's honestly just unfun to deal with now that everyone is amazing at building.

People dont like that you have to constantly train and practice to play a game casually.

Like rainbow six fortnite has honestly become a chore to play, but unlike rainbow six fortnite has no way to seperate casuals, nor a way to matchmake people based on skill meaning every match youre almost guaranteed some sweat that spends 10+ hours a day practicing in PG.

Ive been a big fortnite fan and have defended it since day 1, but even i notice how i have to force myself to play, and how much of a bad time me and my friends have when some ttv/yt in the name sweat comes out of nowhere gun switching in .0000000001 seconds, crouch spamming, building a fortress, while emoting. And it happens far too often.

While fortnite has done something that no modern mp game has really done, &lt;GIVE PLAYERS INCENTIVE TO GIT GUD&gt;, it backfired because theres no containment, no seperation, no limit, and no cushion. Meaning instead of it being controlled and in moderation its more like a plague, slowly pushing people away for a game they can enjoy without devoting their lives or time to it.

Where in other games things become metas for a time then change, in fortnite it becomes a requirement, crouch spamming isnt a meta, you HAVE to do it or else, building walls and floors along with stairs isnt a meta, you HAVE to do it or  else. And if you fall behind you can't win. The game just isnt fun to play anymore.

Or better yet, the players arent fun to play with anymore. And so people seek an alternative where they dont have to try as hard for some easy to hop into casual gameplay.

But in 4 this was not the case causing many people to lose max carbide and omega. There many arguments on why the challenges should be added back and why they shouldn't. But today ladies and gentlemen, I have a solution. Here's a step by step order for epic games

Step 1: Give all players without max carbide or omega there carbide and omega challenge, but altered so they would be gained through exp.

Step 2: Give all people who managed to get max in season 4 and exclusive color. Blue for Omega and possibly Orange for Carbide. These would not appear on the style select unless you owned it, similar to skull trooper.

Step 3: Add these styles to the other items in the Carbide and Omega Set.

I don't mind the shield and mats (I might even say I'm a fan of them), but they seem to have given the best players in the lobby the ability to stay alive longer and more consistently.

I'm an average player, so I'm still capable of getting wins here and there, but I don't remember running into people who were just straight up better than me at the rate I am post-update. The overall pace and feel of the game has changed dramatically, as players seek the 50 health and/or shield award for kills.

Let me be clear, I don't care about a ranked mode or being thirsted every time I get knocked, I think those issues are natural consequences that have sorted themselves out since Fortnite's inception; but I'm not sure if allowing good players to be consistently beaten by phenomenal players is within the spirit of a battle royale (which anyone should, by definition, be capable of winning).

I still play every day, and I won't stop playing if these changes aren't reverted, but there is a part of me that wouldn't mind not being utterly destroyed as often as I do now. ",FortNiteBR

Sorry for any formatting issued as I'm currently on mobile

This is my opinion on the current item pool and how I believe it could be changed for the better. Please use this as a way to have civil discussion, feel free to agree or to disagree in the comments.

Firstly, I believe that there are too many low-impact items that are being added to the game. For instance: The recent additions of the chiller grenades as well as bottle rockets. I find that items such as these provide little to no impact to the game itself. Even though they spawn quite frequently, they have yet to serve any purpose in combat. The chiller grenades do virtually nothing to the other player and the bottle rockets are just way too easy to counter and dodge. It is for this reason I believe that both of these items should be vaulted, due to the fact that they feel like they are just cluttering the item pool at this point.

Secondly, I find that too many items that made the game a lot more fun to play were wrongfully vaulted. One example was the Port-A-Fort/Fortress. The reason these made the game better was to close the skill gap for the possibly less-skilled players (the same exact reason for the bloom staying in the game since day one). A second example is the Impulse/Shockwave grenades. They were quite fun to use and were very useful for mobility and getaways, while at the same time not feeling too overpowered. I think either the impulse or the shockwave should be unvaulted, but not both to prevent overlapping functionality.

TLDR: It feels the item pool is too stale with way too many low-impact items being added with high impact/fun items are being vaulted.

Please keep all discussion civil, and thank you for reading.",FortNiteBR

They've demanded Rocket Launcher nerfs until they got it.  Now they're targeting the heavy sniper rifle.

Folks, this is a Battle Royale.  Battle Royale has RNG baked into it's DNA.  The pro players are always going to target the items inferior players use to kill superior players.

If the heavy sniper rifle gets nerfed they will move on to the next piece of RNG to complain about.  Eventually, they'll complain about dropping from the Battle Bus because inferior player sometimes land on guns and they don't.

Fortnite isn't played by pro players.  It's played by the masses.  It's played by people who have to go to school, or go to work, or spend time with friends and family.  Fortnite needs to listen to cater to the casual community because 99 percent of the player base doesn't play 40 hours a week.

You play your favorite game and people will play theirs. There shouldn't be hate on people that play different games. They want to try something new and who honestly gives 2 shits about who has more views?",FortNiteBR

The spikes lasts for around 5-10 seconds and the game completely freezes, but that's not all I have also been getting degraded performance overall. I am just wondering if anyone else have been having these issues and if anyone has found a fix. 

Thanks!",FortNiteBR

Sure, I've seen people say they could be free sprays and emotes but i think it could be something else...


This might be Epic's first attempt at making a loot boxes system with a random cosmetic(s) inside. I've seen a few comments on this sub about how terrible of an idea that would be, mostly because VBucks cost mmmmoney and it would be nice to know what you are spending that on. 


But if you get free loot boxes from completing challenges, that may be more accepted by the comunity instead of having to pay for them. People like Twitch streamers and players who spend all of their money on a free to play game instead of life necessities could probably get paid in VBucks or something like that from the lootboxes of they have every cosmetic in the game. 

Some other things that loot boxes could contain besides cosmetics could be XP, exclusive sprays/emotes, refund tickets, battlestars, or additional vbucks.


The system for getting these cosmetics could be a rarity system like the one for in game loot. Blue pickaxes would be more rare than green ones, and maybe different cosmetic categories (skins, gliders, etc.) Would be more rare than other categories.

Not all of the rewards could be loot boxes, (if any for that matter; this is a theory after all) they could be other exclusive cosmetics for the season. These challenges would be a great way to implement loot boxes into the game, and it would be really cool to see Epic do this.",FortNiteBR

Getting a Victory is quite a feeling. But after you win there's not much you can do, you can emote or build for a few seconds. But otherwise there's not much before your sent to the lobby.

So, Victory Dances. They wouldn't be emotes, but mini events that are triggered after you win. For example.
 let's say after you win imagine~ fireworks go off, or maybe your chosen lobby music would play, or even meteors rain from the sky.

This would be a locker item that you could choose.

Now I have a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Will Epic Games get sued by a lawyer and one or ALL of the people suing walk away with money?

\-Will Epic Games abide and remove the emotes?

\-Will Epic Games just give up and completely remove all the EMOTES in the game?

Questions want answers. 

We need answers.

What will Epic do?

I started looking online, and found a couple examples of this dance from 2012, and this one here posted to YouTube in 2011:

https://youtu.be/rhaBb36qqGI

Sure the backpack kid seems to have popularized it, but is it enough to claim ownership over it? And where do all the other dances/dancers stand? Should we attempt to find earlier footage of each dance?

I know this is a request that a lot of people talked about but for me it's a very important thing: console players need graphic settings. This could be so useful for players who have bad monitors/tv or like me, projectors. The thing is that when you don't have a decent monitor, you can't really see when players are in the shadow of a tree for example or in a dark house. Moreover, some of us actually have pretty old consoles. I know a lot of people who has bought the PS4 or the XBox one right when it came out (it's almost my case) and whenever there's a bit too much fight or buildings in playground, framerate immediatly start dropping. I think that by adding graphic settings, we could be able to solve this issue.
For me Epic are very good developpers and they could make this possible.
Thanks for your attention,
Have a nice day ;)

I don't get a ton of time to play games, so I try to stay away from games that require super fast reflexes or god-like aim because I'm just not as quick as I used to be and the younger kids roll over me.

&amp;#x200B;

A few weeks ago (very close to end of the last season) I found out that Fortnite had a PVE mode and decided to install it. It was pretty fun! But once I started that I couldn't help but load up the BR and see what the hype was about. Needless to say it was a horrific experience. I went about 20-30 matches without a kill, dying almost instantly, no clue how to drop into a location, and don't even get me started on building (which I still can't do).

&amp;#x200B;

One night while I was trying to do stuff I got queued up with 3 kids. Very young teenagers (or younger?) and were all friends. They all died fairly quickly and somehow I was able to kill 3 people to clear out the building they died it. After that they stayed on the mic and talked me through the rest of the match. At first I felt like ""I can't believe I'm being taught a game by kids young enough to be my children"", but it was actually really great to see these kids generally interested in me getting better as opposed to the normal shit-talking I hear (usually in a foreign language).

&amp;#x200B;

After getting us to I think 3rd place in the match by putting my back up against the storm and riding it in, they asked me to play with them again. When they found out how new I was, they loaded me up into the playground (I had no clue there were modes outside of Squad at that time) and spent an hour teaching me some aiming techniques and building essentials. It was a mind-blowing experience and set me off on the path to actually enjoying BR mode a little more.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still extremely slow at building and tend to rely more on being as far away from everyone as possible to survive because I still can't drop effectively, react as fast, or hang with these people that build like maniacs. But knowing there's some good folks out there, no matter the age, is something exciting and I look forward to those matches where I have people I can understand that are willing to help others get better.

both parties are happy, the guys that bought them the first time will still have something to make them stand out, and the newer players will have the skin they wanted for so long

now, if a new player starts begging for the selectable style they didn‚Äôt even know existed or the guy that bought them the first time doesn‚Äôt ever want it to come back, we know both of them are just entitled children.

epic had no obligation to make the selectable style (skull and merry), and they had no obligation to make the skin come back (ghoul trooper). it‚Äôs a very good move by epic ",FortNiteBR

For real.,"Every time Epic adds something, or changes something that the masses dislike, they go into a crazy uproar, going on about how Epic never fixes bugs, and they never add anything the community suggests, and just how awful a company they are...

1 or 2 months later when that all blows over, everyone is literally back to praising Epic for all of the bugs they fix and community suggestions they've added...

We need to give Epic a break... They have added SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many community suggestions... Like for real, more than any game I've ever played, and I've been gaming since Commodore 64.

They also fix a very nice size of bugs EVERY FREAKING PATCH... So I don't get it when people say ""They need to spend one patch ONLY focusing on bugs."" No they don't. They fix plenty of bugs.

People don't seem to understand that there is a priority list when you're creating a game(and the game is still being created(I know most of you will argue that statement, but that's how it is.)) and some things are just not that high on the priority list.

Considering how much Epic does for and with this community, It's not really that bad when they want to do some of the things THEY have in mind over what the community has in mind. We have to understand. This is THEIR game. Not ours. We're just allowed to play it, and they have a certain vision and direction they want to take their game.

Give them a break guys. They're doing a great job. Just because something bothers you or something you wanted fixed but didn't get fixed doesn't make them a bad company, and it doesn't mean they need to spend an entire patch ONLY fixing bugs.",FortNiteBR

That's not how buying works, you cant go on a shop yelling ""when i was here 8 months ago there wasnt a shirt exactly like these one but in blue, i want that one in blue for free because i bought the yellow one 8 months ago""  


Epic already create too many free content and itens for free just so we can get it easy and be willing to play more the game, you are not going to get more free stuff and stop calling Epic greedy just because they're making their work, if they gave skins for free everytime you guys ask they would lost a lot of money for no logical reason.  


Yeah, the tomato head skin had it, that was epic being nice to people and still the skin had only small changes. They already are nice to us in many ways with these games, they make it so we get confortable playing it and go on and spend money on it. They're a company, not your best friend.

First of all, yes, we all know epic games is a business, stating that doesn‚Äôt make you cool or distinguished. Simply ‚Äúbeing a business‚Äù is not an argument or a valid point for how someone conducts themselves, because we can bring to the table lots of businesses that do things better than epic in certain regards. 

Back on track, what does it mean to be ‚Äúog‚Äù. Well it‚Äôs a simple phrase with big meaning, one most people overlook. We, as early fortnite players financially supported epic, it can be arguably stated we funded fortnite when they needed our money the most, between legal battles with pubg (and bad press to boot) through thick and thin, our dollars were there to help epic games. When I say (our) I mean ‚Äúog‚Äù players. Players who have been here for a long time. I‚Äôm not sorry if this word bothers you, but what else would you like people who‚Äôve played the game for a long time to call ourselves? 

I bought the first battlepass, and I‚Äôm very happy with its contents, it‚Äôs the only thing that ‚Äúpreserves‚Äù all the time I put in as an early player of fortnite. Here‚Äôs the kicker, the battlepass is 950 vbucks. So guess what? For those that argue ‚Äúepic does support ogs by not bringing battle pass skins back‚Äù you need to consider this please.
The battlepass is 950 vbuk AND to get tier 100 it took time, time is money. What about red knight? A skin from the early days, that actually cost 2000 vbucks. It was tied directly to the season 2 battlepass, and cost almost double the amount. So one could say day one red knight owners supported epic twice as much financially. How does epic repay red knights? By releasing the skin multiple times, with no original style added for people who, debatably funded fortnite. Why did only the skull trooper get an ‚Äúog‚Äù style? Genuinely ask yourself this. Why didn‚Äôt red knight? Or love ranger (who releases like every month when he‚Äôs a valentines skin)

What about alpine ace? The Olympic skin that releases around a non-Olympic time frame. 

This is only a problem for me because I realized one thing. Fortnites financial success is due to cosmetic sales. Cosmetics in many games, where you can collect cosmetics always have a certain rarity to their cosmetics. Fortnite however, is like ‚Äúto heck with our customers we want money!‚Äù And yeah before you use the ‚Äúbut epic is a business‚Äù argument, so is LITERALLY every other game. 

If you ask me I can give you multiple examples of successful games that treat exclusive content accordingly, because they do exist. 

(TLDR start)
-Fortnite is financially grown by selling cosmetics
-Fortnites gameplay is shooter/br but it‚Äôs longevity is due to skin sales
-Fortnite is a shooter game that‚Äôs secondary goal, in a nutshell, is collecting cosmetics
-as a game driven by collecting cosmetics, to ruin the player perceived value of their cosmetics by constantly releasing them, is to ruin the players experience, given that a part of the experience is collecting cosmetics.
-any time players are driven to collect cosmetics they inherently assign rarity to them, rarity creates a certain satisfaction among owners of rare items, if items lack rarity players lose satisfaction and are left with disappointment. (TLDR end)

That‚Äôs been my experience and thoughts on the matter, I find it particularly sad that I can only wear 4 skins that are rare to this date, I loved alpine ace especially because I‚Äôm Canadian, now a bunch of squeakers are running around with it, most of which aren‚Äôt even Canadian, some of which don‚Äôt even like Canada, all because these squeakers thought the skin was rare, because they thought it was cool. Trust me that‚Äôs the motive for kids to buy alpine ace, Epic knows this and uses it to profit, they accept the rarity of skins in their minds, but disregard the players who first supported them by buying this skin..

These are beautiful and I do love to rock my OG Snowflake Umbrella but let's be real, this is only shown briefly and it doesn't really mean much. It only shows you managed to get a single win in the span of a few months.

For the Battle Pass items, that doesn't really mean that you're good, just that you managed to play a lot. Even the unlockable variants of the skin are based on play time and random, easy challenges.

**Nothing to really brag about right?**

Now let's take a look at arguably the most popular shooter of all time: Call of Duty. They have tons of ways of showing off your progression and skill level through the game. For example:

* Unlockable Skin Variants through skill-based challenges
* Unlockable Weapon Skins through skill-based challenges
* Unlockable Calling Cards through skill-based challenges

To be more specific, let's look at Black Ops 3 and the Specialist Skins. 

Unlocking every little piece of the gear through the skill-based challenges was one of the most fun and rewarding challenges I've had in a game. Grinding for the gold skin motivated me to play the game. And once I earned it, I was proud to show it off. It felt good going in to a game where I could display my hard work.

Same goes for Dark Matter. You wear these items like a badge of honor.

Imagine for a moment that there was a skin you couldn't earn in Fortnite until you had 500 wins. Imagine there was a Wrap that you unlocked at 5, 10 and 15,000 kills. (There are tons of suggestions on this subreddit, Im just trying to make a point).

I think you would find less people bitching about 'rare' and 'OG' skins coming back to the shop if there were other ways to display that you've been here since the beginning, or that you're a top tier player.

I really do think that one of Epic's next big projects should be performance-based rewards. It will make the community happy but also will very likely increase play time for a lot of players who like to grind.",FortNiteBR

So, as I always do with kids trying to troll me, I called him out:

""Let me guess, you're 14, you're the class clown and you're trying to be funny right now?""

He pauses and an audible giggle can be heard through the mic. And after a minute of him continuing to try and fool me into believing his story, he gave up:

""Nah bro, I'm just trolling you, but honestly you guessed pretty close, I'm 13 and I am the class clown.""

So we laughed it off and proceeded to play our squad game together. He asked if I wanted to duo with him after. 

We played quite a few games together after that and learned a lot about each other. At one point he asked me: 

""Do you think I'm funny?""
""Yeah of course, I don't think I'd be playing with a 13 year old if I didn't think you were funny.""

He seemed to like that. Later, he asked another question:

""Hey, did you ever like, get bullied in school?""

Everything became clear in an instant. This kid needed someone to talk to. And so we did. We talked about life for a while, his school experiences, the friends who let him down, the girls he never gets, and the bullies who have no regard for his feelings.

He told me he has a rare condition that affects his intestines and has resulted in him having parts of it removed. He explained that much of the bullying stems from this.

Before he logged off for the night he thanked me for listening and said he was glad he could talk to me about those things.

Now, I don't know who this kid is, but never before have I been so emotionally touched by an encounter online. Fortnite brought me into this kid's life at just the right time, and I'm hope I made an impact.

Needless to say, I'm excited to hop on tonight and play with my new friend. Thank you Fortnite for facilitating this.


TLDR; What I thought to be another kid trolling me in squads, actually became a heartfelt encounter where I learned this ""troublemaker"" was actually a kid looking for someone to care about him.

I've started playing the game as a few mates of mine are playing it so I felt like tagging along. I'm trying to learn some basics as I have a few days off to practice but I'm getting my ass kicked hard (I've played around 30 games and landed only 10 kills). 

Is this usual for beginners to get stomped so much when starting? I'm finding the learning curve way too steep to enjoy the game even a bit right now, and I don't have that much time to dedicate if it's going to take ages before starting to have fun. The problem I'm finding is although it's common to get stomped when starting off a game, you usually learn from it/improve, whereas I feel with fortnite if you just land in front of a much stronger player you're just straight off back to the lobby without being able to practice at all. 

Is it just too late to start the game now, I feel there aren't many beginners anymore and not that many new players starting? ",FortNiteBR

If this should be moved that's fine, but I wanted to make a post which is a bit of a cry for help.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing for a long time and only with my IRL friends, and they don't take the game as seriously as I do. While I love them and playing games with them, I want to take FortNite a bit more seriously. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have played heavily competitive in Gears of war, Call of Duty, Halo and was in a top raiding guild on WoW for a while, I'm not new to the competitive scene and have had to go through this for these games. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking for a group (Or even a duo partner) that wants to get better, is willing to analyse game play to identify mistakes, is active often and sees themselves continuing in playing this game for the foreseeable future.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm at work at the moment so DM me if interested and we can run some games tonight. I will make a little montage tonight to upload so people can check if I'm near to what they had in mind before they message if needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, sorry if this is in the wrong place. Thanks so much guys, I love this community and all you've done for the game.

1- The burnt styles were in the loading screens I don't think they would advertise OG styles. 
2- Crackshot didn't get a style he got a back bling that will probably be for everyone as well so how do gingerbread skins get an OG style but crackshot doesn't? He is legendary so you would expect him to get an OG style as well but it doesn't seem like this is the case.",FortNiteBR

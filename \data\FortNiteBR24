119,cjtem224,1557973330,bp70u0,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bp70u0/fortnite_x_tf2_event/,0,fortnite x tf2 event?,"this is very random (and maybe bad,) but the games are fairly similar! tf2, if you dont know, is a ~~war-themed hat simulator~~ First-Person-Shooter game, where you fight as 1 of 9 classes in an event to capture a flag, push a payload, capture points, and play explosive soccer. also, I haven't played since season 6, so don't be too mad if something like this already exists. (it doesnt, as far as i know.)

&amp;#x200B;

the event:

you would be given a chance to choose a loadout and skin, which can include some vaulted items. all items you will also get will be on their highest rarity. you'd fight on the island, and not on a tf2 map, but you would also only get healing items and ammo from chests and floor loot. it would be a 32 v 32 match, with respawns that will turn off after the 4th storm closes.

&amp;#x200B;

the classes:

scout:

double barrel, pistol and pickaxe (every class has pickaxe, so ill remove it from here.)

soldier:

rocket launcher and pump shotgun

pyro:

a pump shotgun

demoman:

2 grenade launchers. simple.

heavy:

minigun and pump shotgun

engineer:

heavy pump shotgun and deagle.

sniper:

heavy sniper and tactical smg.

medic:

a silenced pistol

spy:

six shooter, and their pickaxe actually does quadruple damage from hitting the behind.

&amp;#x200B;

special items:

some classes also have some special items that help them be with the HUGE UNBALANCE i see some of the other classes are.

pyro:

a flamethrower! it fires very quickly and does tons of damage, but has extreme damage falloff.

heavy:

a sandvich! this sandwich is able to heal you 75 hp and above health, but will have that extra health slowly deplete over time.

engineer:

a building maker! this item works kind-of like the cell-phone, and takes 100 metal to make a building. the sentry, is lvl 3, and fires very fast. great for trap bases. the dispenser heals 5 hp every half second. the teleporter is an item that simply teleports teamates to another teleporter you placed. you also cant place more than one building, except the teleporter, where you can place two, the entrance and the exit.

medic:

a heal ray-gun! this weapon heals your teammates 15 hp a second, and after healing enemies for a total of 105 seconds, you can special click (M3/R3 on pc/console) to make your healer invincible for 15 seconds.

spy:

the sapper, disguise kit, and invis watch! the sapper slowly destroys buildings, the disguise kit makes you look like one of the enemies when pressing tab or L3 (even though there isnt much diffrence,) and the invis watch makes you have the shadow stone effect for 5 seconds when pressing M3 or R3, and takes double the time to recharge.

&amp;#x200B;

challenges:

beat 5 matches of the tf2 event (get: the cozy camper backbling.)

make 5 targets invincible in a single match (get: the deutsche doctor skin.)

heal 2000 hp as medic (get: the medical assistance wrap)

get 25 sentry kills (get: the wrench pickaxe.)

heal 500 hp from the dispenser (get: the launcher wrap)

get 20 kills on all classes (get: the tf2 logo backbling.)

emote after 12 scout kills (get: the boston boy skin and the atomizer pickaxe.)

emote after killing 5 times on all classes (get: the kazotsky kick emote.)

emote after 12 sniper kills (get: the sydney sniper skin.)

kill 40 people as spy (get: the dapper wrap)

get 200 kills in total (get: the tf2 wrap.)

disguise as 50 people (get: the dapper back backbling)

&amp;#x200B;

cosmetics:

the deutsche doctor, epic: the stock medic skin in tf2. (description: ""and zat is how i lost my medical licence!"")

the boston boy, rare: the stock scout skin in tf2. (description: ""boink! boink boink bonk! b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boink!"")

the sydney sniper, rare: the stock sniper skin in tf2. (description: ""I AM THE KING OF AUSTRALIA!!"")

the wrench: a large version of the stock wrench in tf2.(description: ""sentry, goin' up!"")

the atomizer: a large version of the atomizer in tf2.(description: ""he-hey! im flyin!"")

the tf2 logo: a large tf2 button on your back.(description: the time has come...)

the cozy camper: the cozy camper from tf2.(description: this furry pal is your best freind!)

the dapper back: a bowler hat for your back.(description: the dapper hat for your dapper back!)

the tf2 wrap: a wrap of a black color which has the tf2 logo commonly placed on it. (time for tf2!)

the medical assistance: a wrap which makes the weapons have semi-bloody bandages on them (description: ""DOCTOR! I NEED ASSISTANCE!"")

the launcher wrap: this explosive-only wrap gives the weapons orange and white stripes, with one ""man-launcher"" symbol. (description: ""god bless america!"")

the dapper wrap: gives any weapon a dapper tie to go with that dapper look. (description: ""im afraid not."")

the kazotsky kick: the heavy's version of the kazotsky kick in tf2. (description: this dance will need some real leg strength!)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so that's it! i thought the two similar games would make a good combo. most people think that the opposite side of the combo is awful though, so dont get to mad from hating on tf2 or me even trying the idea of the combo.",FortNiteBR

(emotes, sprays, emojis, &amp; toys all fall under the same catagory.) 

This Would give a chance for newer players who missed seasons to get a skin they missed. And people who don't have the V-Bucks to spend can get that awesome legendary skin they wanted to buy. It would even give the defaults a chance to feel included!

It could be set that you can only get the free items if you've played for at least 3 months or even a year, but I think it would be better if it was just available to everyone.

Items available in the current battle pass won't be available, but will be the next year.

1. The Season 3 skin (The Reaper) and the new one (John Wick) look different. Sure, they're similar, but if you're not 200m away from them, you should be able to tell which one it is.
2. Having the original doesn't make you entitled to the new one. They're different skins. That's like saying owning Rust Lord should automatically give you Star-Lord.
3. A new style for The Reaper would be cool, but unnecessary.  While Fortnite could get pretty creative with a new Reaper style, it just isn't necessary. Like I said in my first point, they look different.

That‚Äôs definitely what sets it apart from every other BR, etc.  That being said, I think a huge change in the building mechanic is necessary to increase this games life cycle.  I can‚Äôt imagine trying to start the game as a new player now, and the game has become increasingly stale for those with time played.  So, how can we fix it?

I think using the Port-A-Fort mechanic is how it should be implemented.  You gather materials and depending on how many materials you gather you can select a port-a-fort of certain presets.  Forts, staircases, bridges, large walls etc.  This still allows for the building mechanic to exist but reduces the spamming that we see today, and creates a more tactical game once again.

Now as i am sure everyone here already knows, there is a new john wick skin coming into the game, due to the fact that there is also going to be an event for the premiere of john wick 3. Now, we already have a john wick skin in the game called ""The Reaper"" which was a season 3 battlepass skin, which as you guys know, battlepass skins are exclusive to their seasons and Epic has gone on to say many times they would never return..

Now, Epic is technically sticking to their word and they are not releasing the reaper skin back into the game, but it is still somewhat of a shady move at this point to just redesign the skin. We all know they are both the same skin, and Epic is only doing it for the sake of money because of this deal with the creators of the movie. I am usually one of the few people to try and see everything from epics side, on even the most polarizing topics on this sub, but to me, this is one time i cant do that. This is all about money and Epic are showing that their word is no longer concrete because yes, they didnt lie, they wont be rereleasing the reaper skin, but it shows that if money is envolved, they will try and do whatever they can to work around their own promises, which is wrong. 

You may call me a whiner, which is your choice, personally it isnt so much about the skin, it is that they arent keeping to their promises.",FortNiteBR

I may not be able to articulate my thoughts/words in a sufficient way, but I hope that I can be able to wrap your heads around this to be able to understand what I'm trying to get at.

Epic has had an ongoing issue with communication and a lack of listening to those who made the effort to voice their thoughts on issues or whatever it may be. However, recently, Epic has been taking better steps in the right direction to listen better to the community. This v9.01 update is a great example of this. Amazing stuff, Epic.

Now, in regards to the drum gun update in this update, Epic stated, ""since its unvaulting, the Drum Gun effectiveness has been slightly higher than we wanted."" What stuck out to me is their usage of the word *slightly*. This was not a slight nerf to the drum gun. The damage taken off was a large reduction for the drum gun.

So...what's the issue? It's just a word, right? No, there are implicated intentions behind that word, or, at least, to my thoughts of their possible reasonings. It's clear Epic caters more to the casual. It's clear that Epic wants to make things easier for people who do not, or are unable to, put in sufficient time for possible gained skill levels. Due to Epic stating, ""slightly higher than what we wanted,"" along with the fact that they have not vaulted the drum gun, it is clear that they wanted to keep this kind of gun in the game, but knew that it was very OP. How did they know? Because of the drastic nerf. The base damage has been reduced from 26/27 to 22/23, letting us know that they were aware of how powerful the gun was.

So, again, my issue is their usage of the word *slightly*. Epic using an understatement of a word to brush off like it wasn't too big of a deal, instead of owning up that the drum gun's effectiveness was a lot higher than what they wanted. This is cowardly and selfish behavior. They did not want to admit that the gun was not that op when they've clearly made a big nerf to it. This loops back to the idea of Epic not owning up to things, or at least not saying or doing much for some time, disregarding our importance of feelings and what we think of things. This isn't healthy behavior.

Now, maybe I'm completely wrong and overthinking things, but if that is the case, feel free to correct me and help me understand things. I'm not trying to bandwagon onto a ""hate traim"" or whatever; I'm not trying to seek out negativity or poke fun at them. I'm only trying to help and would love to be corrected if I'm partly or fully in the wrong/misunderstanding things.",FortNiteBR

Also, every time I see another creator change their code they always tweet out saying how great the customer service team is.

IMO Fortnite is the greatest game in history to create content for:

‚Ä¢ New Items each week
‚Ä¢ Large changes every 3 months
‚Ä¢ New skins/emotes that also provide content
‚Ä¢ The game was born for clips
‚Ä¢ They support even the smallest of creators!

Big up Epic Games!

Obviously some more than others, like people hated 8.2 and many disliked 9.0. Of course not everyone hated these updates and there is no official consensus, but it seems as if every update that players dislike is a suprise update that drastically changes the game without the players knowing. Lets review some fortnite history, specifically regarding patches...

4.2- this update was disliked by many due to the addition of the jetpack, an addition to the game that completely changed the flow of gameplay. The worst part is that there was no player feedback or easing in to the jetpack, as it was just thrown at the players out of the blue.


5.0- obviously the double shotgun glitch was a glitch that needed to be removed to to its domination of the meta, but when 5.0 first launched many people were angry about the shotgun delay, as we got no warning as to its patching, it just came out of nowhere. 

7.0 and 7.1- to keep it short and simple, Epic threw two items that completely changed the flow of fortnite out of the blue (planes and the sword), without any player feedback or public testing.

8.1- Ballers, another item that was forced upon us on update day that completely changed how fortnite is played.

Now lets bring it back to 9.0 and the current outrage at fortnite. As we see history tends to repeat itself and all of the updates that angered players (besides the removal of syphon) have one thing in common, they suprised players with a complete change in the flow of the game on update day. In more recent patches, Epic has been doing this more often, where they try to appeal to shock factor and be overly creative, but as we see, the players DO NOT CARE. I think that a simple solution to this problem is to have a test playlist, a playlist that dummys the new update so that Epic can collect player feedback and test for bugs. This might remove some of the excitment on update day, but it will improve game quallity and ease some player tension.

P.S. this took me a while so any feedback is appreciated. If I left something out I will edit the post and let you know.",FortNiteBR

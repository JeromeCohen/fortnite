2,LilBeaverBoi,1558385812,br185v,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/br185v/this_sub_needs_better_moderation_long_post_for/,32,This sub needs better moderation. (Long post for discussion),"This will be a completely tone-neutral, but analytical, critique of the moderation within this sub, as is permitted under the rules. I have tagged two different moderators when mentioning them, but I am not attacking them. I did so to provide receipts and to encourage two-sided, fair discourse. 

I could write a super long post about the poor moderation that this sub has, but I am going to keep it as short as possible, and address the removal of a single post, and the precedent which it sets for the content on this subreddit. 

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bqmb01/you_can_create_flying_structures_like_this/) is from yesterday, by u/SupRAS99. In it, he demonstrates a bug which allows for structures to not break down properly and instead float. It received a great amount of attention: 3.6K upvotes and a response from an Epic employee. Moderator u/Niccorrazi\- removed the post for being an ""exploit,"" which was a decision supported by other moderators. However, this bug does not grant any legitimate advantage. Zero. If anything, utilizing it would be a disadvantage. Breaking any of those individual builds in the floating structure would cause the entire thing to collapse. That, my friends, is a disadvantage, and most definitely not an exploit. 

Now, let us look at legitimate exploits, which have been allowed on this sub. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b6aoz1/baller_can_pass_through_tomato_head_and_stay/) demonstrates the baller's ability to pass through a structure, and hide in it without being seen. It received 1.2k upvotes and was visible on the front page at the time. I am not saying this post should have been removed, but it offers much more of an advantage than the floating builds, so then why was the floating builds one removed? That is an exploit, whereas SupRAS' post is a bug report. And what about [this one?](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bg8rux/i_found_a_baller_hiding_spot_at_polar_peak/)

The logic does not hold up. Again, I am not asking for MORE removals, I am just condemning the poor logic. 

This sub needs less removals. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bnu5z8/one_way_floor_ceiling_at_mega_mall/) demonstrates a one-way floor/ceiling in Mega Mall. Basically, one side you can shoot and see through, the other you cannot. That is absolutely broken, and needs fixing. Imagine if that post wasn't removed for being an ""exploit,"" and somebody from Epic saw it? It probably wouldn't be in the game anymore, or at the very least Epic would be working toward a solution. It would be really unfortunate if a moderator ever were to die to that in a game, because they would be at fault...

The moderators, despite the recent criticism, have made no attempt to address the concerns from the community. In fact, they are completely oblivious to there being any issue at all, and are drunk in their power. While researching for this post, I encountered a [very surprising comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bqy3vt/cursed_image/eo8xatp?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) by moderator u/FinallyRage. A moderator of a sub with over 1 million members legitimately downplayed their community's criticism as being ""mad about their post being removed."" No, FinallyRage, that is not why people are mad. People are mad because this sub has legitimate issues in its rules and the moderation procedures. There is an abuse of power. Being oblivious in comments such as that, FinallyRage, demonstrates the lack of connection between the mods and the community as well as the stubbornness evident within the moderators. 

Let us look at a question they could ask the sub rather than write all of us off as being salty: ""What changes, if any, do you think this subreddit requires in its rules, moderation procedures, or post removals? If your criticism is directed at a single moderator it will be ignored."" 

Coincidentally in the midst of all of the criticism on this sub, r/FortniteCompetitive's mods ran a survey to try to improve how that sub is ran. The mods there receive much, much higher praise than the mods here, yet they still demonstrate a higher desire to improve than this subreddit's mods have ever demonstrated. 

I really hope this post is removed despite not breaking any rules. It would only prove my point even more, and pave the way for another user to make a post about ME being removed. Then, that will be removed, and the cycle will just go on and on. If that is how you wish to moderate this sub, and never reflect upon your methods or improve your ways, the sub will never improve. And the entire point of moderators is to ensure the sub is as good as it can be.",FortNiteBR

I’m going to mourn hard when it goes. More than when my cat Deryck died, and I assure you, I mourned *hard* when that big ball of fluff finally passed away due to old age. 

It fulfils everything you could want from a competitive mode. It’s fast paced, gives you a clear objective and allows you to play more aggressively than usual due to the three lives you’re given.

Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t want any more than one life in *Battle Royale*, but if Epic could ever add an LTM akin to the John Wick Mode in to the regular rotation of LTMs, I would be so happy. Say that in Craig’s voice from South Park, because that’s how I’m saying it.

Release 9.1 has arrived, and we have continued to work on known audio issues.  This release features many quality of life improvements, especially around awareness of enemy players close by.  Thanks for the continued Fortnite audio quality feedback in these threads, it really is appreciated.  As always, please feel free to point out areas of audio improvement and bugs to us in the thread; we’ll be reading and investigating what the community shares and report what we’re working on.  Here’s an overview of the improvements in release 9.1 and updates on the future audio roadmap:

**Release 9.1 Audio fixes and updates:**

* Switch audio dropout issues fixed for real- apologies, this was meant to be in for 9.0 but we had unexpected technical problems.
* Fixed location of close-range enemy pickaxe impact sound, so it plays from the impact point and not the player that's pickaxing.
* Removed ducking of building sounds when firing your weapon.
* Lowered the minimum velocity required to trigger a landing sound; this helps prevent players from silently ‘bunny hopping’ up ramps.
* Added a new jump sound for enemies that's louder than your own.
* Increased jump sound attenuation to match enemy footsteps.
* Reduced the amount of time that it takes the enemy in-air audio loop to kick on, for better awareness of an enemy dropping in on you from above.
* Boosted volume of occluded footsteps and landing sounds.
* Tighter spatialization of close-range pickaxe sounds from other players.
* Added a clearer sound when an enemy confirms an edit on a building piece within \~2 tiles of your position.
* Removed glider audio tell for players traveling through a Slipstream.
* Added a new “Headshot + Shield Break” sound, for when the two events occur at the same time. If a shield break is ""CHINGSHH"" and a headshot is ""PA-CHING"" then the new sound is ""PA-CHINGSHH"".

**Release 9.1 open audio issues:**

* Fix for PC audio device swap issues; we are planning to have this for the 9.2 release.

**What we’re working on for the upcoming season:**

* Fix for footstep sounds on the edge of structures gives audio as if you're walking on the ground. 
* Better hear the approach of enemy players outside player-built structures.
* Improvements to issues of sounds dropping outside of player FOV.
* Improvement of close versus distant player gliding sounds, to help clarify distance of gliding enemies.
* Longer sounds properly playing during Replays.
* Improved differentiation of teammate verus enemy audio.
* Internal testing of binaural/HRTF solution that will be a great help to headphone players, as well as other spatialization improvements.

As a reminder, the best way to inform us of your bugs is following the below format:

* replay URL
* time code of issue
* display name of player followed via gameplay view
* description of issue

We need kills and/or win based matchmaking even is solos.","I understand arena may be something to look into for being matched against people of my skill but i get a message that i can't play it for some reason and i doubt many casual players like me would use it anyway. I really like watching streamers play, all the amazing stuff they do without even thinking about it, is sometimes really exciting. However, as a casual player, noob in BR games as well as shooters in general, it has been a huge nightmare and not enjoyable at all. I am on a constant loop of loading screen, lobby (which is my favourite part of the game and wish it lasted longer), bus ride, parachuting (for which i can't figure out how to go down fast after i have deployed my parachute) and then either be lucky enough to not encounter someone and maybe make it to top 25, or kill someone that has not found a weapon yet before being killed on my first real encounter. Most games last between 1-3 minutes for me and hiding while waiting is not really fun at all. Every day i start the game thinking ""oh man, let's enjoy a few games finally"" but i am always feeling disappointed after 2-3 games not because i am getting killed but because i can't really do anything meaningful or fun. The lobby and bus ride and loading screen routine lasts more than my actual gameplay. Not sure what could be done, even playing with similarly bad friends is not fun because the only thing that changes is that we die together instead of alone. And I don't think i will get better since i don't really get to play at all so that i can get better. It's like a neverending circle. My time is limited as i am kind of an old dude (compared to the game main demographic) with work and other stuff to do and it really seems like having some casual fun with this game is impossible, no matter how much i would love to. Sorry for the big post but i needed to write this down for those that are like me, there must be people that just can't follow the flow at all, wish i could play against them one day, sounds like it would be so much fun.",FortNiteBR

Being forced to go up against players who have such a massive skill gap between me and them takes away every iota of fun to be had. At best matches are just me gathering loot and materials for “TTV_BiGMeATMike”. Unless I’m lucky enough to have friends playing. Then it gets a little more bearable.

Hit edit on ramp, left stick click and ramp rotates 180 degrees. 

The options are ""limitless"" / based on the number of buttons on your controller.

This would greatly reduce the skillgap between PC and console in regards to editing. Yes, there are some fast console 'editers' out there, but even they cannot compete with a semi-decent PC player who knows how to edit. With this, we would see more console players able to be in a box with another player, edit their ramp, take a shot, edit the ramp in half, take a shot, reset the ramp, edit in half again, take a shot. Again, there are some console players who are capable of doing this - but they work 3x as hard for something that is so much easier to do on PC. This would enable console players to close range fight against PC players much better.

I’ve been playing Wick’s Bounty and can’t seem to live long enough to get a win.

I’m better with medium-to-long engagements, but just not quick or buildy enough for close engagements. I’d rather knock builds down from a distance than try to push for high ground in a 90.

As for my resume, I’ve got 3 solo wins, and in each winning game, I had 5 or less kills. One squad win.

I can hop on Xbox or Switch tonight, probably between 9pm and midnight west coast if you’re willing. Drop me a message on reddit and we’ll talk!

PLEASE consider making this a permanent mode, or replacing team rumble with this. But it isn't perfect and could use some changes.","First of all let's talk about why it's so great.

A lot less RNG based than normal modes, you spawn with two of the best ideal guns you could ask for.

There's a clear objective besides just being the last person standing, it makes it a lot more intense and it's very refreshing compared to normal BR, and because of this you can land anywhere you want depending on your playstyle, either landing at an obscure spot to loot and farm before fighting people, or hot drop and just go for as many kills as possible.

Also, it makes dying in a fight a lot more forgiving.

But, I really think it needs siphon and the 40% extra harvesting rate.

Because the way it is now, the mode feels like you get punished for doing well, and it being so fast paced makes this even more apparent.

Harvesting is way too tedious for the amount of players you could potentially constantly be fighting, and if you fight another player and lose health in the process, yes they lose a life, but they get to respawn *above you* with full health and restocked ammo. Siphon and mats for kills could change this.

Shield and healing seems to be less hard to find in this mode which is a step up, but it could be so much better.

EPIC, please consider making this a permanent model you could just call it Bounty, I think a lot of your more competitive players would really appreciate this.",FortNiteBR

&gt;**HOW IT ALL STARTED:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Power Chord** had a problem with her white mesh shirt under the armpits. While playing emotes, the mesh shirt would look **stretched and bad**.  
&gt;  
&gt;So **Epic Games** after the skin's comeback decided to fix the white mesh shirt by removing it under the armpits, but while fixing that they **accidentally changed** the colors of the skin.  
&gt;  
&gt;After people noticing it, **Epic Games** ""fixed"" the colors and tried to put the original colors, but they didn't put the correct colors for everything and now it doesn't look 100% like the original **Power Chord**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**OUTFIT DETAILS THAT CHANGED:**  
&gt;  
&gt;The little **straps** on her gloves should match the **yellow and chrome colors** of the **pickaxe** as the original version, but got changed to a **neon yellow** and **white**. The **metal bar** on her back got changed from a **black metal** to a **chrome metal**. Her **shirt** got changed from a **black color** to a **black color with brown spots on the front/sides/back** and now the shirt looks **dirty**. There's other little details: the **pants** are a little bit **lighter**, the **pink bands** are more **colorful** and on the **pants** she presented some little **white straps** that got changed to a **black color** that now it's not very **visible**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Epic even changed the **skin color** under the **white** **mesh shirt** to a really **pale skin color**, that doesn't **match** the **skin color** of the **head**. The original **white mesh shirt** was more **defined** with **shadows**, now it almost looks like it's **invisible** and really inserted in the **skin texture**. but maybe it's just the **skin color** under that causes the **effect**.

&amp;#x200B;

**BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURES:**

&amp;#x200B;

[In this picture you can see how her straps should match the Anarchy Axe, but now they don't match. Credits: u\/JoTheWeirdo](https://i.redd.it/noxbr6fsm8z21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**I know it's not a big deal for you guys, but for someone who waited such a long time for a skin, and that is really careful even about little details, it's really frustrating.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Imagine your favorite skin being changed to the wrong colors and that really bothers you cause it's your favorite skin but you can't do nothing about it. That's where I am right now since the change, cause the colors should have changed exactly like the original colors, but they did not.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**I would really appreciate it if you guys helped me by upvoting this post, so Epic Games workers can see this post and hopefully fix the colors of the Power Chord skin, so she can return exactly like her original version with the armpits fix.**

Thank you.

Thats ridicilous! The most basic mechanics in the game are still not fixed that occured around season 4. Right now, the most 2 noticable game breaking bugs are: not building while turbo building (even when you have all maxed out), people phasing through every single structure, being able an opponents shotgun through a wall and damage the player. Some other known problems are high ping for everyone in a match, non stop fps drops and crashes. Im not hating on developers, just dont know where this is going.

It should be completely gone when your crosshair is extremely close to the enemy and reappear when you move it away from the enemy. Additionally, the glare shouldn’t appear if your opponent isn’t at least 25m away from you.",FortNiteBR

I know you’re reading this because obviously reddit is the only community that matters. I have a suggestion, or a concept if you will.

-Give us everything for free. Every skin should be free we deserve it. All skins should be reactive and free. 

-I didn’t get the chance to play in season 1 and 2 (still an OG tho) and I should get all those skins free as well. And the loading screens.

-I know v bucks won’t matter anymore but I should still get 3,000 vbucks every time I win and 4,000 vbucks every game I don’t win because I’m keeping this game alive. 

-Please put every LTM in the game and let me play them all simultaneously at once. One shot 50 v 50 with all gold guns and no building, but unlimited mats, and I get to be thanos collecting Jon Wick’s bounty while I protect the durr burger from my airplane with infinity blade wings. Again, this is a concept.

-please vault everything. Then destroy the vault. 

-fishstick?!

-have a casual game mode. And an arena causal game mode because sometimes I like to try but only kinda.

-maybe the real tilted towers was the friends we made along the way. This isn’t really a concept, more of just a thought.

-hear me out. triple pump.

-all battle passes should have no time limit. If it takes me 6 seasons to deal 200 pistol damage, well maybe your game is just too hard.

-vault the drum gun and give us a guitar gun. 

-send me actual money for playing the game

That should just about do it, thank you. I will cry and complain if this is not completed by this afternoon and post “they don’t listen to the community this is why we all play apex” if you don’t. Okay.",FortNiteBR

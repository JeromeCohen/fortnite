&amp;#x200B;

I'm consulting you guys on my dilemma. So I used to love fortnite. I played it all the time on Xbox One and it kind of died off for me due to me getting busy and finding other games. Now that I have a PC and am really enjoying playing games, I want to get back into it. I miss Fortnite, a lot, however something is holding back. One issue is that I'm afraid I will be very bad on keyboard and mouse and just bad in general because I haven't played or experienced any of the new items and weapons. I want to try it but I think that everyone is just to good. I also want to play on a Xbox controller on my PC but am afraid that I will get out beat by Keyboard players. Can someone just help me out and convince me to play and help me out with choosing keyboard and mouse or controller. 

PS I just recently got into mouse and keyboard gaming but I have been using controllers all of my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks boys",FortNiteBR

I mainly play the noob friendly modes like Team Rumble. My personal best is 30 kills.

I usually get around 15+..

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm doo doo at regular modes.  
I don't have any friends playing so I play random squads, naturally I'm put with kids or kids shouting in foreign languages. I can't do solo squads.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a fan of solo that much, I find it boring and a little slow paced.

I don't go out hunting for players so that's probably the main cause.  
And then main cause of that is my bad building.  
I've a good aim, I make smart moves but my building is not great, I mean it's improving but it's just not where I need it to be.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?  
Work on building in playground?  
Find people to play with?

Try and beat 30 kills in Team Rumble?

Go hunting for players rather than quiet dropping?  


Any advice would be appreciated.. I genuinely enjoy the game, I'm playing on xbox but I'm really tempted to buy a gaming pc and get more into gaming (played COD etc in my early teens but that's it).

It seems most people play with friends, my brother plays with his friends and only really plays solos when he's waiting for them to get online.

&amp;#x200B;

How do you make solos more fun?  
Any tips on building? - I've got it set up right (youtube + my brother)

Finding people to play with? I'm working so I'm not always online.

Any ideas?

8,FoxDKnight,1549645094,aoiiib,75,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aoiiib/what_if_we_got_season_7_story_wrong/,1,What if we got season 7 story wrong?,"As you all know, season 8 started with Sergeant Winter invading the BR island and thinking he was a bad guy that looks like Santa that was spreading the ice on our island but it turned out that it was just a seasonal character, not really important.

Going a little bit back to season 5, we got the viking zone added along with the ""Harbingers"", specifically the one named Ragnarok. A harbinger is a person or thing that announces something or someone that is coming and Ragnarok means the destruction of our world according to Nordic beliefs.

Now returning to season 7, analyzing the loading screen #7 we see the return of the Ice King and he's acting surprised because he's awake and the ice is melting. We also know that ""The Prisoner"" was kept in that dungeon with special cuffs that restrained him from moving and using his powers.

We can assume that the Ice King was the jailer of ""The Prisoner"" because he considered him a threat. As the ice kept melting in contact with our island and the intense fights that regularly happen, the Ice King decided to make a final and desperate move. The Ice King unleashed his Frost Legion upon us hoping that he could win or we ceased our attacks that were weakening his hold on ""The Prisoner"".

Sadly his attempt failed and we defeated the Frost Legion, thanks to this, ""The Prisoner"" managed to escape his prison but was still bound by the cuffs that restrained his power. 

He managed to find the first key, which allowed him to slowly wake his powers again. We started experiencing earthquakes each stronger than the last.

Then he could release the cuffs in his arms by imbuing himself with the heat of a bonfire, revealing lava-like flowing through his charred skin.

My speculation is that ""The Prisoner""'s vision of ""seeking balance"" will cause Ragnarok, which was what the Ice King was trying to prevent and kept delaying. We see that ""The Prisoner"" is causing the earthquakes and as his power grows, the island will suffer great changes. I'm not sure if a volcano would rise up, but the skin of ""The Prisoner"" is unsettling.

**TL;DR** The Ice King was a good guy and ""The Prisoner"" will cause Ragnarok.",FortNiteBR

This is different from Blackout's launch. When Blackout came out, a lot of people's reactions to it was simply ""Well, I need a break from Fortnite and this is something different. It's pretty good"", but with Apex is more of ""I'm thinking about Apex constantly, this game is addicting, I can't stop playing, etc.""
  A lot of these streamers seem genuinely addicted to Apex and excited to play it non-sponsored.

Ninja is saying the same things he said about Fortnite in those first couple weeks. Remember, the first month of Fortnite's life he swore ""I'm not done with PUBG, PUBG is still my main game I'm just having a lot of fun with Fortnite right now"".

This might actually be the end of Fortnite's reign...",FortNiteBR

But... Sarge Winter and the Slushy Soldiers were not this seasons' villains at all. And the Infinity Blade was wielded by The Ice King, not by Sarge.

As we see in the S7 Week 3 Loading Screen, Sarge Winter is in front of Frosty Flights, enjoying a mug of hot chocolate. While in the background, a squad of A.I.M.s can be seen filling a X-4 Stormwing with gifts, like, they are working for Sarge like they are Santa's elfs. Where's the villany in all of that?

Also, remember that Green A.I.M. that was leaked a while ago? Where is he? (I've heard that he got removed from the Athena/Battle Royale files).

My guess is that at first, Epic wanted Sarge Winter
to be Season 7's main antagonist, and the Green A.I.M. would probably have been involved in this early version of S7's storyline, too.

There was a trailer for S7 already, with Sarge Winter being the villain. But later on, Epic felt like changing Sarge's role. So in the end, The Ice King ended up being chosen to be the season's antagonist. And maybe Epic was too lazy to make a new version of the trailer, featuring the Ice King?

For me it‚Äôs literally never. I haven‚Äôt used a spray once since they first came out. They‚Äôre pointless, nobody sees them and they have no place in the game. 

We should be rewarded as follows,


OPEN DIVISION - Rewarded with a skin wrap, bronze or something of the sort. 

PROSPECT DIVISION - Again a skin wrap but maybe silver or gold ? Maybe a skin variant such as a different powder skin. 

CONTENDER DIVISION - A new skin exclusive to reaching this rank, it could literally be any skin but just something to show to the lobby you‚Äôve made it this far. 

CHAMPIONSHIP DIVISION - A legendary set that looks good, I‚Äôm talking Pixaxe, glider and an  emote, the full works. 

Nobody wants a spray, I certainly want to be able to show other people where I placed. Even if in the lobby there was an actual pin next to my name or in game it showed a pin for all to see. It‚Äôd just be nice to get some recognition for doing well. Instead of pointless sprays

One of the main reasons new players are turned off by this game is building. The skill gap is so massive but it‚Äôs also the defining feature of this game. Sure you can add OP items that‚Äôll destroy any building but now all you have done is pissed off a loyal fan who‚Äôs dedicated months to this game. Lurking in other BR subreddits (especially that super popular one) it‚Äôs clear what they want is a BR were the person with better aim wins the fight. 

I know some of you are going to say ‚ÄúrAnKeD mOdE‚Äù and I‚Äôm completely on bored with that. But Epic has no plans on implementing something like that in the near future. At least with a permanent LTM like Ground Game we can give new users the opportunity to have fun while keeping the rest of the game at its core.


TL;DR:
Make Ground Game permanent so new users can enjoy a BR without learning how to build instead of trying to nerf building with OP items",FortNiteBR

So Iv'e been thinking about it for a long time, and now I think this could be an awesome idea.

This gamemode is all about skill:

\- each player starts with the same loadout

\- Each player starts with the same level of materials.

\- Players can choose their loadout from the option menu of the gamemode, so the could match against players with the same loadout they chose.

The zone starts small, and begins to move after 2 minutes.

The winner will get 100 XP if he wins.

And when you have died, instead of going back to the lobby, you have a play again button near the ""back to the lobby"" button.

What do you think about that idea? For me it's sounds pretty good.

P.S I'm that a pro player, so maybe I said something that will triggered you or something lol.

Another P.S: Sorry for my bad English! It's not my first language.

Please, don't be mean to me. You can also explain yourself nicely :)

Have a great day! :)",FortNiteBR

I go by the handle joel X, I‚Äôve been playing Fortnite since early December of last 2017. I have about 700+ wins and 20,000 plus total kills, both from pc and xbox. When I first started this game, it was like nothing I had ever seen before.. It had building like minecraft, graphics that reeled you in, and an environment that was fun and not toxic.. I started playing the game before the game ultimately blew up and a lot of things have changed since then.. But let‚Äôs break this down...

So the reason that I believe that this game has basically gone from being a game based more about IQ, decision making, and skill, to a game based upon RNG, luck, and spamming, is because of one simple addition to the game which was turbo building. 
In patch 3.0.0 or the beginning of season 3, was the addition of turbo building, which went from having to place what was built where, to a mechanism that allows you to spam your build anywhere it can go, at any given time, at the literal speed of light, and to be honest, when it was first added, I didn‚Äôt think of this as being bad... Being on a controller, building was a slower thing, it was a little bit harder to build, things on console were pretty bad through those seasons as well with a lot of crashing, lot of downtime, a lot of waiting etc.. But the game was smooth, it felt good to play when actually playing, it made you want to play the game.. Seeing huge names such as Myth being crazy good builders, and Ninja being a great player, made you want to play the game religiously. Fortnite in that time had this certain feeling and we can all agree on this.. 
Within a few weeks time-span turbo building had started to what I believe had it‚Äôs negative effects on the game.. The average player started to become very good at building, high ground before hand would be something skilled players/builders would be able to take, and it‚Äôs because they dedicated their hours and time to learn the games mechanics and develop their IQ of the game. Now, you can go into playground mode for 5 hours, and become just as good as the best builders in the game. Fortnite has introduced countless and countless different counters to building since patch 3.0.0 trying to fix what they brought upon themselves in turn ruining this game further and further, and soon it‚Äôll be at the point of no return.. The problem is that there is no actual skill gap in this game and that is a HUGE problem, people who have grinded and put in the work in this game, are not rewarded anymore. 

Counters to building as of 02/07/2019:
RPG
GRENADE LAUNCHER
GRENADES
STINK BOMBS
FIREWORKS
PLANES
DYNAMITE
DEAGLES
SCAR SPAMMING (accept it)
HEAVY SNIPERS
MINIGUNS
MOUNTED TURRETS
BALLOONS 
QUAD CRASHER

The one thing that made their game different, was the building aspect.. The fact that you could build for cover was unlike any other game we had ever seen before. I just listed off 14 guns/items in the game that counter building as a whole. Rocket spamming in early Fortnite used to be a huge issue and in early Mw2 days we liked to call that NoobTubing. Me personally, I don‚Äôt think that any weapons of explosive descent belong in Fortnite, as they take no skill or effort to use. It‚Äôs very easy to shoot someone‚Äôs wall immediately after you shoot RPG for an easy high damage hit or kill, especially with the ONE-SHOT deagle.. I constantly see hate being brought upon the deagle, but I never see anyone bringing up what really ruined Fortnite.. Turbo building basically made it so that everyone can get a chance, so that the casual player can stand a chance against good people, rather then Fortnite adding a ranked version of the game.. I think the way that this was all brought upon was awful.. I think Epic games used to listen to their core main audience and now they listen to nothing but corporate head offices.. The problem is that Fortnite created a large sum of money shortly and the owners took advantage of this.. Trying to appeal to people who aren‚Äôt hardcore fans of the game is the wrong way to go, making the game easier is not the way to go. What made Fortnite different was because it was different, now you barely even wanna get on anymore because you don‚Äôt know what kind of screwed up shits gonna happen to you today.. 

My suggestion?
Is to make this game more based upon skill level, rather then appealing to the everyday noob. I suggest getting rid of every single item I listed, and removing turbo building.. 
We want to see people be competitive, we do not want to see people spam rpgs and deagles at other players in huge Fortnite tournaments, we do not want to see people throwing stink grenades and spamming miniguns.

Imagine a Fortnite where the only explodes are grenades and smoke grenades are another counter. Where weapon skill and IQ truly came into play, where you‚Äôd have to think about building and what you would have to build before, rather then spamming your mouse or joysticks relentlessly. This would make the competitive scene much bigger, much more competitive and I truly believe would bring back the life to this game, would bring back the good feeling and smoothness that Fortnite once had. Right now this game is based on nothing but RNG, and who has the better load out, or if you have a plane. 

Fortnite also needs to add shield per every kill, and possibly some building material for kills, also increase the amount given from objects, not a single person is playing this game as a farming simulation to gather materials for half of the game. 
Many of you may agree with me, and many might disagree.. But if you‚Äôve played since season 1 or season 2, you‚Äôve seen the negative impact that these additions have added to the game. I think as a community we need Epic Games to fix this game that we all love, because it‚Äôs really, really getting out of hand. Thanks :)

But with the recent earthquake events, I think it‚Äôs finally time for the true end of Wailing. Here‚Äôs the proof: 


In Season 6, Wailing Woods received a major overhaul. A new underground lab was constructed. This lab seemed to be researching rift technology, and was able to build a stable perma-rift, and even short-range teleporters. But something isn‚Äôt right here...

There are two small details to notice in Wailing Woods‚Äôs that drive this theory. Dotted around the lab and connecting cabins are several photos, two of these such photos of areas removed during the catastrophes of Season 4 and 5; Anarchy Acres and Dusty Depot. 

My theory is that the former owners of Dusty and Anarchy run the lab, and are researching rifts and their space-time altering properties. Likely, they are hoping to reverse time back to stop the meteor crash, The motivation doesn‚Äôt really matter, I‚Äôm just trying to state that this lab is going after something bigger than just short range portals. 

Now where do the earthquakes fit in? Well, have you seen the movie Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse? If you haven‚Äôt, spoiler warning! Throughout the movie, the villain Kingpin‚Äôs main plot device is a powerful particle collider capable of opening holes between dimensions. The device is so powerful, that it ends up causing seismic activity when activated, shaking the ground beneath the city. So, in theory, the lab at wailing has developed in secret a much larger rift generator, which is causing the earthquakes. 

So what‚Äôs going to happen with all of this? Well, in the movie, the heroes have to shut down the collider before it grows unstable and destroys the city, as dimensions fold in on each other due to the energy. Something similar will probably happen at Wailing. What will happen exactly is hard to say, but likely it‚Äôll be similar to the events of Season 5, with an entire new biome dropped into the area, replacing the woods and possibly other surrounding areas including Lonely and crates. 

What do you think could end up in this area? My money‚Äôs on a jungle, but other theories such as a volcanic or aquatic landscape are possible too. Tell me your thoughts below!",FortNiteBR

I loved it and played for hours apon hours, and had so much fun. It was balanced, had a decent weapon and item ratio, and the building feature made it unique. But since the beginning of season 7, it's been declining fast. They add these pointless item every week, so now everything is unbalanced. The building is out of control and it ruins the game for me. It changes so much that I cant adapt fast enough, and it's not like I can just hop onto a game and try to improve. It's impossible for any player that's either new or not good. Epic says ""It keeps the game fresh"" but personally every update before I get on, I think to myself ""how will it be worse this time?"" Or ""what did they mess up now?"" Call me salty but I'm telling you, the game is ruined for me. There's also way to many glitches to be forgivable. If I quit, I'm not coming back. I'm probably gonna move to Apex, so peace out Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

The Norse gods such as Odin the All-father, Thor son of odin, Loki brother of odin i believe, etc. wait for ragnorok to happen so they can fight surtr.(Loki in norse mythology is not thor's brother. Marvel made loki being thor's brother for reasons of making an interesting story i guess) Surtr wins the battle in the mythos. I think it would be cool if we get skins that are based on norse, Greek, Spanish, Egyptian, and African mythology gods. What if the ice king is a frost giant or something like that.

Have we thought about the cube this whole time? \*Theory and Steps on how the cube is secretly returning.\* )Possible Spoiler.(

1. Cube is spotted in lobby background, nothing to important.
2. New Years eve event, purple comet is spotted crashing into ocean (live) nobody notices.
3. Cheeky Glitchers glitch underneath of Polar Peak and discover a Cube Rune or Cube writing on a rock in the ground (def. Kevin)
4. Few days afterwards a cube is seen flying around in the sky for the first few minutes of every match, this could be a texture glitch but considering how it warps around and always goes in the same direction maybe it isn't.
5. Marshmello Event occurs, First time in history we are able to explore the storm without damage done to us, with low grav. There must be reasoning behind this correct? A purple light was seen pulsing in the doorway to the cave at polar, multiple players seen it but the other 6.999999996 million were busy gasping over the amazing event.
6. Shards begin to slowly dissapear from the stone shards at Loot Lake leaving chunks in the stones, possibly using the marshmello event as a cover up.
7. The backpack for the cube ""shackled stone\* has been lighting up at the beginning of the match for no reason, when it is only supposed to light up whenever there are 30pl. left or you have damage dealt.
8. Earthquakes are now being heard, a little strange considering there were 24 days left in the season and they started occurring. Now mind you tremors and stuff don't normally occur for 24 days, so what is causing this earthquakes? \*Earth King, Fire King, Cube, Etc, anything really can do it\*

My Theory is going to be that the cube crashed into the water during new years eve, making its return from save the world, due to the fact the storm king was useless and didn't need to be added, and after defeat the cube was revealed in the water. After crashing into the water the Ice King witnesses the crash, and heads to Loot Lake, slowly stealing shards from the cube fragments gaining their power. Ice King then uses the shards to harness a power big enough to cause a blizzard across the map in order to gain control of the map, and even creates fiends. The Fire King quickly realizes and melts his way out, which he then stops the map from icing or freezing, melting everything and escaping to paradise to warm up and regain his powers. Ice King panics and during the Marshmello event, he uses the distraction of the party to gain even more power from the shards in his dungeon without anyone noticing so he gets away with the power. Story is at a standstill here as everyone assumes that the Fire King is using the fire in the week 10 loading screen as a signal for the fire on the big mountain in the backdrop. Meanwhile this is all happening, the cube is being angered as the shards may act like its children and the cube is pulsing and gaining power from the water like it did at loot lake, and causing tremors to happen across the map every time it gains more power. Eventually season 8 will come about and the cube will reveal itself, showing that it is even more powerful than it was during season 6, completely shattering the map and maybe even possibly destroying it. Another thing to mention, the little ice purple droplets that came off the cube during the event were dropped on purpose, so the cube didn't die. The only reason the cube ran out of power and blew up is due to the cube using to much of its power or maybe that is how the cube reproduces, and the shards were never meant to be shards. That is my theory, please let me know what you think of it.",FortNiteBR

(Please note that its impossible to make changes that everyone will agree with),"Here's some changes that epic could make in the next update or v8.00

Hand Cannons (Deagle)
Damage decrease 78 to 70, and with the 2x headshot Multiplayer it can do 140 in terms of damage to the environment it should decrease to 140 so it can no one shot stone buildings (when frist built) however it still will able to one shot wood structures so be careful 

SMGs
- Vault the P90 and in its place a Epic a Legendary Tactical SMG (I suggest the KRISS Vector) and Unvault the Purple, Blue and Green tac SMG, but change it to Blue, Green and Grey. With decreased damage so it would be grey: 17, green: 18, blue 19, purple 22, gold 23 

Other item and weapons Vaults and Unvaults

Vaults

- Compact SMG
- Dynamite 
- Balloons 
- Mounted Turret 
- Minigun

Unvaults
- Bolt Action Sniper
- Heavy Shotgun (but increased the headshot 
damage to 195 for the purple and 210 for gold)
- Tac SMG 


Explosives 

- Reduce the Spawn Rate of RPGS and Grenade Launcher (To the same rate as the golden bois before the hotfix)

- Supply Drop only 

- a damage falloff system. If a player gets hit directly by a RPG or a Grenade from the Grenade Launcher it does the full 110 damage if the explosive hits 2-4 feet from the player it should do around 60 damage then if a player is just inside the radius, it should do around 30 damage.
 

X-4 Stormwing

- boosted Stormwing will no longer be able to destroy non player built structures and will take 1\6 of the planes if done
- Planes will take twice the amount of damage if raming into player built structures
- decreased the fire rate of the turret slightly

Llamas

Resources increased to 400

Heavy Sniper 

Spawn rate decreased (mid to early game, almost every player had a Barrett 50cal)

**One win? Why do you suck?** 

Can't build for crap and my aim sucks. Next?

**How did you win?** 

I lasered him with a blue AK while he was on a quadcrasher and ...ah, who am I kidding? I spammed his wall after third partying him while he was on a mountainside trying to heal from a campfire and the storm got him. I'd never seen the winner animation from that viewpoint so I was like, ""Wait. Am I dead?"" I couldn't even muster enough to emote on him. (Would've been the donkey laugh because of the storm death and all)

**Do you just solo?**

I did for a while. I've been playing since season 2 or 3 (didn't know it would be important to remember) and, while I used to multi-player Halo, I was initially cautious about playing with 9 year olds. (Never mind that all of them could yeet me into a bush) I finally gave it a try and got comfortable with minimal talking to kids, engaging fully with adult voices, and muting hispanic sounding players with 28 family members screeching in the background.

**What's a geezer like you doing playing forkknife?**

I've been a gamer since the Atari days. My kids are out of the house (they say I'm living the dream playing every night)  I'm athletic, well read, and fun at parties. I'm not going to pretend something's not enjoyable to me because some swooning doofus thinks I shouldn't play video games.

**Any advice for the younger guys playing?**

Get gud.

Hand Cannons (Deagle)
- the Deagle needs some changes to make it more balanced. Firstly the damage done to players should be decreased from 78 to 60, and with the 2x headshot Multiplayer it can do 120 in terms of damage to the environment it should decrease to 137 so it can no longer one shot wood buildings

SMGs
-a extremely annoying weapon a fast fire rate that destroys builds. So Vault the P90 and in its place a Epic a Legendary Tactical SMG (I suggest the KRISS Vector) and Unvault the Purple, Blue and Green tac SMG, but change it to Blue, Green and Grey. 

Other item and weapons Vaults and Unvaults

Vaults
- Heavy Sniper 
- Compact SMG
- Dynamite 
- Balloons 
- Mounted Turret 
- Minigun

Unvaults
- Bolt Action Sniper (including the legendary version)
- Heavy Shotgun (but increased the headshot damage to 195 for the purple and 210 for gold)
- Tac SMG 
- Drum Gun

Explosives
Possibly the most annoying and noobist way to kill other players. Things need to change made such as the following 
- Reduce the Spawn Rate of RPGS and Grenade Launcher (To the same rate as the golden bois before the hotfix)
- Supply Drop only 
- a damage falloff system. If a player gets hit directly by a RPG or a Grenade from the Grenade Launcher it does the full 110 damage if the explosive hits 2-4 feet from the player it should do around 60 damage then if a player is just inside the radius, it should do around 30 damage.
and finally 

X-4 Stormwing
The most controversial thing in fortnite. As a plane user. I understand why people hate them so much, which why I came up with a solution to make both sides happy.
- boosted Stormwing will no longer be able to destroy non player built structures and will take 1\8 of the planes if done
- Planes will take twice the amount of damage if raming into player built structures
- decreased the fire rate of the turret slightly

No. 3rd partying is completely fair, and anyone who thinks otherwise has never had the satisfaction of shooting an RPG at a massive build battle. 

Thirsting is LITERALLY just finishing off a downed player. Why wouldn't you do this? The goal of this game is to eliminate all other players, and finishing off a downed player makes sure that you have one less competitor in the game.

I have been playing since the beginning of Season 5, and hold a lot of nostalgia regarding it being fresh and crazy hard to noob me. I play and play and have gotten better, building and playing with different weapons to find a way to improve myself. I remember when they removed the silenced smg, added quad launcher, grapple, and every other stupid ‚Äògame breaking‚Äô thing along the way. Every outrage with each update causing lag or unfair advantages or weapon imbalances (explosive damage through walls remember that one?). I gave up just over halfway through S6 because of these updates, although I don‚Äôt recall which one specifically, but I had had enough. I picked up a Switch and bought Pok√©mon Go and forgot about fortnite for weeks. One day, I had time to kill and wanted a shooter, so I load up fortnite for the first time in weeks, and coincidentally it is just about three days into S7. 

And it was amazing.

The updated graphics of the game looked spectacular against the snowy/wintery sunlight over the land. For the first time in GOD knows how long, there was no stuttering when I tried to build ANYTHING, whether it be a simple 1x1 or placing a trap. Team Rumble was introduced, and it was THE most refreshing the game had ever felt, it was enjoyable to play again. The weapons ACTUALLY felt balanced with one another (except for when the AK first came out that was OP LOL). Shotgun/SMG wasn‚Äôt the overpowering combo, the snipers still had their different weights to their shots, and explosives weren‚Äôt too, well, explosive. (Even though dynamite and grenades were like the only things you could find for awhile). It was NOT perfect, I am not claiming that, but it was the smoothest the game had ever run.

However, with each weekly update the game has deteriorated, not only regarding items and guns but the gameplay itself too. Weapons have come and gone more rapidly (and more unnecessarily) than any other season, removing redeployability from big teams and introducing it as an item across all playlists, a shotgun buff WAS introduced (and super awesome) but I can see it has since been nerfed again for certain weapons, slow/still gliding glitch, broken zip lines (which has since been worked on), and most notable to date the removal of aim assist. 

I spent just under two weeks away from the game because of a move to a new apartment, and loading up the game a week ago I found myself completely fucked from every tweak made in my absence. I don‚Äôt see any posts about the change in character perspective? How the reticle is now closer to your character making it harder to see around you? Or how the sensitivity has been tweaked to where the same settings I had for the better part of a year are all of a sudden too fast/clunky to handle? I‚Äôve been on this sub for almost as long as I‚Äôve been playing this game and I didn‚Äôt see anybody else mention it, but this is obvious to me.

I‚Äôm not someone to rant about EVERY change to the game being garbage or gamebreaking but seriously, this time? This is unplayable. Epic, PLEASE PLEASE listen to the community when we tell you to FIX the core issues of the game instead of introducing new items/weapons/events each week!

Thank you for reading this far if you have, sorry for the long post. Keep it civil discussion!",FortNiteBR

PC will always have an upper hand that will never change. Just because PC has a natural advantage it does not mean that it should be given disabilities or console should be given advantages. 

Lets take a look at the basics.

PC

* 103 buttons on PC for a standard player (101 on the keyboard and 2 on a normal mouse not a gaming one)
* Many PC players have computers built for gaming so they have the ability to run the game way better than console
* Not every PC player has a good computer. There are many PC players like me who struggle to get over 70 FPS most of the time.

Console

* Xbox has 11 buttons and PS4 has 13 buttons. If that is not enough for you I have no idea what to tell you. If you have someone who has 103 buttons at their disposal compared to one with 13 it is already an unbalanced fight.
* Console does not have to option to change their settings. This is the most stupid thing that I have ever seen in my life. What is the point of making console players even more disadvantaged then they already are this should be changed ASAP.

The entire argument about aim assist is very stupid and I have no idea why it exists I am not going to talk about this in this posts so it does not turn into a war.

I'm not exaggerating when I say I heard nothing in a squad teamfight last night except bottle rockets (that weren't even part of the fight, they were going off on the opposite side of tilted) and airplane guns blasting.

I'm not sure if I'm the only one, but footsteps and player direction are gone half the time for me. I can head above/below footsteps in buildings but in build fights I've had 3-4 people drop down on me just yesterday with no indication they are there until I've been taken out.

My last issue with the noise of this game is the fact I can't hear my teammates audio comms in-game chat or 3rd party team chat. I have my current in-game sound effects around .12 and I am still having issues with how loud the game is. 

There has got to be some solution other than turn up your game volume and voice comms audio. No, I should not have to potentially damage my hearing to properly play this game. We need a response on Epic what is going on with the audio. I've been here since Season 2 and it only gets worse each season. I typically ignore the complaining and frustrations because I really enjoy this game, but last night being in a 4v4 fight and the only thing I could hear was planes and bottle rockets was what broke me. 

Thanks for reading and let me know I'm not crazy.

**If a game element is spatial awareness, that should be one of the primary focuses and I feel it is becoming more and more hidden.**

**TL;DR It's really terrible that such an important ability to discern sound and audio is getting increasingly distorted and LOUD.**",FortNiteBR

Remember the lead in to Season 6? The Volcano was coming! We have the image files leaked... that turned out to be the bounce pads around the corrupted areas.

We got the cube that carried us through the summer. No Volcano... or so we thought.

It's been there all along, hanging over us as we've watched the map change and shot each other to death. 

Mt St. Helen blew it's top off in May of 1980. A natural disaster set off by an earthquake. Ash was spread of multiple states, truly an event to never be forgotten but was also never expected.

Recently earthquakes have struck the island of Fortnite. The Fire King has escaped and he has already rid more than half the island of the snow the Ice King covered it with.

If you're observant, the snow melted in a particular way, from the Northeast down back to the Southwest. Nothing to note there.... right? 

A light has been spotted recently... coming from a mountain range off in the distance to the... Northeast of the island. Rumors have said it could be the people of the Fire King signaling to him from a far. Well then... 

What if I told you there's a reason for the two things and they connect? What if I told you we have been staring at the volcano right in the face for nearly 8 seasons now.

I mentioned earlier that Mt St. Helen, previously thought to be just a mountain, blew it's top off in what was truly a natural disaster. 

The snow, melting from the Northeast to the Southwest until it slowed to it's current state. Islanders of our far off mountain (Northeast of the Island) are possibly signaling to the Fire King. The earthquakes have begun and they have been synonymous with setting of volcanic eruptions to volcanoes nearby. The heat is rising in the Northeast and the earthquakes are only getting stronger with time. 

My last piece to you, so you can connect the dots yourself... look at the week 10 loading screen, the mountain I have been describing is missing in the background where it should be while the Fire King looks on... almost as if the eruption was so powerful, the mountain.. or volcano.. collapsed on itself...

Season 8 is coming my friends.

The Fire King is free and he's looking to do what the Ice King once thought he did... claim our Fortnite Island.

Being able to revive eliminated teammates is the greatest addition to a BR game. One of the most common complaints this game has always had is teammates that die early on in the match and have to sit there and watch their friends play. Apex fixes that, but they do it in a way that doesn't break the game either. You get 90 seconds to touch your teammates body, then have to find a respawn beacon and revive them with no loot.

2. The winner of the last match and the kill leader being broadcasted on screens across the map. This makes winning feel so much more rewarding, and it really adds a new level of excitement and competitiveness.

With the positive uproar that apex has been experiencing these past couple days such as the fact that they doubled their concurrent players from 2 to 4 million in ONE day and basically every well known streamer is praising how great and fun the game is on social media, I‚Äôm sure that Fortnite has become weary of the fact that if they do not address the wants of their own community that they will not stay on top for as long as they would like.

There is evidence that the restaurant itself is completely crushed by a massive chunk of ice, given that there is one right where the restaurant would be, but let‚Äôs ignore that for now. Greasy is most likely coming back, similar to Tomato Temple replacing Tomato Town, maybe sometime around the earthquake event or in Season 8. 

We have seen Onesie, Tomatohead and Grill Sergeant in the Season 7 loading screens, but never Beef Boss. Onesie had one appearance in the Week 6 Loading screen and Grill Sergeant and Tomatohead can be found in 2 loading screens, The Week 6 loading screen and the ‚ÄúTender Defender‚Äù loading screen. All of these skins, excluding Onesie with her as a battle pass skin, have been in the shop in Season 7, Tomatohead with 1 appearance and Grill Sergeant with 2. IIRC Beef Boss last appeared in Season 6 at the beginning of the Food Fight LTM, between November 14th and 16th, and hasn‚Äôt been seen anywhere at all since.

I think this long disappearance of Beef Boss is leading up to Greasy‚Äôs uncovering and a selectable style for Beef Boss, similar to Tomatohead‚Äôs Temple style, but with a retexture like the Frozen Legends pack. Hopefully if this is true they add extra features to the model like Tomatohead‚Äôs Fork and Spoon crown, such as a transparent block of ice stuck on his head.

Best of luck, Burger Boy. We hope you‚Äôre alive and well.",FortNiteBR

Everyone wants to get them to max level, but they could use a major improvement. Are these nitpicks? Kind of, but I'm still curious to see what you guys think.

&amp;#x200B;

MUSIC:

What if we had 4 music packs, instead of three? We currently have 2 remixes and an original, like how in Season 6 we had the OG remix, the Floss remix and the Eerie original. If you wanna just push sales, than make the fourth song another remix, but I have another idea. What if, each season, you call upon a music artist to make a music pack? For Season 8, we could get a Marshmello music pack, and then we could get a Virtual Riot music pack, or something. It's a stretch, but it'd be really cool.

&amp;#x200B;

EMOTES:

God, we need way more emotes. There's 5 emotes in a pass as of now, and there's 2 unlockable emotes, making 7. But let's be real, emotes are a huge selling point to consumers. Emotes are so damn popular, I would argue 10 would be the best amount (including unlockable emotes from skin challenges). You have an entire season to make these, so it wouldn't be too hard. (this isn't something I'm incredibly passionate about, just from a business standpoint, it makes sense)

&amp;#x200B;

PICKAXES:

Way too little in the main pass. There's 4 if you count the ones unlockable from skins, but there's one in the main pass. ONE. Pickaxes are a huge cosmetic, yet there's more contrails than pickaxes? That's dumb! Increase the Pickaxes in the main pass from 1 to 3.

&amp;#x200B;

""But wait, with all these new items, where do they go? There's only a limited amount of spots.""

Well then, I guess we'll have to make room.

&amp;#x200B;

EMOTICONS:

You add a new thing each season (eg. Wraps, Pets, etc) and you've been replacing some emoticon slots. However, I still argue we have way too many. Emoticons can be great, (I have the F emoticon in my first slot on the emote wheel) but some are just unnecessary.

&amp;#x200B;

SPRAYS:

Same with Emoticons, reduce the amount.

&amp;#x200B;

1000 XP:

God these are useless. Anyone can get 1000 XP from just playing a game. This is not a reward, it's a cop out. Get rid of these.

&amp;#x200B;

CONTRAILS:

Just make them work after using a rift/launchpad and we'll be just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

BRAND NEW COSMETIC?:

There will be a brand new cosmetic, there always is. Music, Pets, Wraps, there's always something new. So, despite the fact that you've probably been working on it for months now, here's some suggestions:

Hats: Backblings... but on your head. If you think about it, so many skins have really good hat options. Cuddle Team Leader head, Drifts mask, Mushu and Hime's masks, Lynx's cap (first stage), Zenith's Visor, etc. Just look on [fnbr.co](https://fnbr.co/) an you'll find all sorts of potential. This would make it possible to remove helmets from many characters, and that would heavily increase dev time, as many models would need an upgrade, but it'd be well worth it.

Lobby Themes: Considering people have wanted this since the beginning of the season, this is most likely. I mean, I'd prefer hats, but this would still be really cool. Maybe 3 in a battlepass? You can do Season 3, Season 4 and maybe even make a new one? Who knows, but it'd make the lobby way more vibrant.

Battlebus Themes: A full on, decked out battlebus, with new music and a new exterior! This would be pretty cool. Some may argue that they only serve some use at the start of a game, but so do contrails. You could include old battlebus's, like the christmas bus, the halloween bus, and maybe a new bus? I think that'd be cool.

I miss Teams of 20.,"To me, 50v50 was always too much people in one team, total mayhem, about not reviving downed ones, absolutely rare display of teamwork. Logically that's obvious because with that high a number you can't expect the same. Which is why I loved teams of 20 so much more - the number allowed  a decent scope for teamwork, planned gameplay, looking out for teammates and provided a large team mode which wasn't absolute chaos entirely, and also enjoyable at the same time, especially for new players who just get killed instantly and not revived in 50v50. 

Team Rumble on the other hand is a respawn mode - which i would sometimes not like. Shields are literally rendered useless in this mode, no point in farming and use of tactics - it's pure chaos which doesn't end until a fixed goal is reached, which again isn't so much fun for me who wants a larger team mode than squads but which has the mechanics of normal squad games and nothing more. Although, new players would love team rumble and it is also a decent practice mode for improving aim and building (to an extent only as everybody just spams so there's no point a lot of the times).

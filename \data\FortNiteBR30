&amp;#x200B;

First of all, i was surprised that i could not post in the fortnitebr subreddit because it says that i need to make a request to post while saying that requests to post are disabled ... no wonder there are only positive posts or skin concepts and no negative/constructive criticism posts.

&amp;#x200B;

But since  there are many posts about season 9 in this subreddit i figured it would be alright to discuss a change coming along with season 9 right ?

&amp;#x200B;

So, it is stated in season 9 patch notes that the pump shotgun is vaulted and that a new semi-auto shotgun is added, leaving us with 3 shotguns that are the tactical shotgun, the spas-12 and the new shotgun with both the new shotgun and the spas-12 having a pretty high rarity, leaving the tactical shotgun as the most common shotgun for the biggest part of a match.

&amp;#x200B;

That brings two uestions:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Why not vault the tactical shotgun instead of the pump shotgun since the new shotgun is also a semi-auto shotgun, what is the logic here ?

\-Why vault the most used/beloved item by the majority of players that no one complained about, where did that come from ?

&amp;#x200B;

Note that players had the choice between the pump shotgun and the tactical shotgun, and they used the pump shotgun almost 100% of the time, so again, why vault it and replace it with a tactical shotgun that looks like a pump shotgun ? I remember that few patches ago, the pump shotgun was buffed so that it could oneshot through a very close range perfectly placed headshot, and that most of the players were happy about it, so where is the continuity, where is the logic ?",FortNiteBR

I’ve wanted it gone for the past two seasons now and there is no sign of it going away. With a seasonal biome you’re going to have players just wanting to avoid the snow area - we’re getting into the summer months and we are still seeing winter. I don’t visit any of those locations except for if there are challenges there that require me to go or if the team Rumble circle goes there, which it often times doesn’t. 

I’m super happy they took Tilted away, but they just put something back in its place? Why aren’t they taking more opportunities to change the map at a higher level like they did when they introduced the winter biome than a few locations here and there?",FortNiteBR

I’ve been a player since season 2, to me fortnite is one of the most accomplished games of all time given its popularity. It’s the only game that I can play with friends and family. I’ve always played this game casually, I’ve never played it to become a professional TTV soccer skin, it was always just to have some fun. As time has went on I’ve noticed that this game has become less and less casual which is saddening. I’ll admit some of the builds some of you guys can pull off is pretty impressive but I find it pointless when you have to build a maze of builds and edits, like is this game really that important for you to win dude? It’s not even a ranked solo? Speaking of ranked I played it for the first time a couple days ago and it’s the first time I’ve ever actually had some fun in the game for awhile because i felt like I actually stood a chance against people. I don’t know why I needed to say all this but I just needed to vent about this game. I miss the old fortnite where you weren’t judged by your building skills I guess.",FortNiteBR

Let me first start by saying that I love this game. My son and I have really been able to bond together playing something we both enjoy it. In all honesty we have probably invested over $1000 dollars into this game over the last year and a half, with a good portion of that coming from accidental purchases.

The return system (or lack thereof) in the item shop combined with how easy it is to make accidental purchases (the X button is used to exit in the game and many other games) is starting to leave a bad taste in our mouths towards the game and EPIC as a whole.

Giving “3” return coupons is nice… But they are also used up within the first couple months of playing due to accidental purchases.

I have literally watched my son turn around to have me look at something in the shop and watched the controller fall out of his hands and hit the X button on his desk, purchasing the item immediately without any sort of purchases verification pop up (like you have in Save the World).

I understand the fact that accidental purchases most likely make up a decent percentage of EPIC’s profit margins. I have built and run companies before, I get that making a change that affects a corporations bottom line is not something any Board of Directors would respond favorably to.

EPIC needs to bite the bullet and get it done. It has gotten to the point that system is literally bilking children out of what little money they have to buy V-Bucks.  

We've heard excuses from EPIC and watched the can getting kicked down the road after each update for a long time.

But all the delays are leaving the players with the impression that the accidental purchase “gravy train” is nothing more than a cash grab that EPIC will hold on to until as long as they can.

I have read responses from EPIC employees where they talked about EPIC creating a system to allow returns within five

minutes of purchase as long as the item wasn't used in a game. This was MONTHS ago…. nothing has happened yet.

Is there a timeline to fix this?

We have seen EPIC make lighting fast changes to the game to fix other issues, why the delay on this???",FortNiteBR

This is what they should do to it.,"The current map is a mess. There’s no flow to it, no concurrency. What once felt like a perfect battle royale island now feels like a map created by a team of monkeys. Here’s why...

The snow biome - This was a poor addition in many ways. Not only did they unnecessarily expand the size of the map with this addition, they couldn’t even properly fill it. Nobody wants to go hear and that resonates in almost every public game. We have 3 big POI’s and huge amount of open planes of nothing. The only POI that is actually good is Polar Peak, which would be 10x better if it wasn’t on a giant iceberg. They need to melt this whole area and write it off. At least cut out everything below Polar.

The jungle biome - This one is the worst. This is largely ruined by the volcano. It’s essentially pointless and a waste of space, the entire idea is that you can use it to travel, well we have about 30 geysers around for that anyway... In addition to this, there is far too many geysers and far too much verticality in this biome. This means that you will rarely run in to people here because nobody is ever going to travel on foot when there’s a geyser nearby. Unless you’re around Lazy Lagoon or the west side of the volcano you’re not going to see anybody mid game. It’s a useless area.

The Block - What is an amazing idea on paper does not come off anywhere near as good in game. It’s interesting, sometimes, but we don’t get enough time to learn it which puts so many off of dropping at it. It’s ugly as hell the way it’s literally presented on a giant block as well.

Desert Biome - The desert is actually pretty good. Paradise and west world are top tier POI’s, however I believe it’s lacking another major POI. They should expand desert junk junction into a similar version to its’ counterpart, while switching out the original junk junction for something else.

Long story short, the map is not going well and season 9 will likely mess it up even further. Hopefully one day we can see a season 3/4/5 map return.",FortNiteBR

Thank You Epic Games for a Great Year!","In an effort to focus on other aspects of my life including school, activities, extra-curriculars, and other various things. I will, most likely never play Fortnite again.

Fortnite is the first and only game that I ever got hooked on too. I have played and still enjoy many other games such as Halo and even some old games such as Team Fortress 2; however, Fortnite is different. For the last 1+ years, I have played Fortnite practically every-day and been on this sub every day. I have spent a lot of money on this game, $100 more than any other game, and it is sad to see this all go. The thing people might not understand about this is that Fortnite helped me get through the last year in a way that nothing else could have. A lot has happened in my life in the last year, but this game was always where I went when I was stressed out or depressed. This game means more to me than I bet 99% of you can imagine. It was a motivating factor to get out of bed every morning and it kept me happy in a way that nothing ever has. (yes, I know I already said that) It is just something that means a whole lot to me. 


This entire community means so much to me. I’ve had a rough day many times, including today, but this has always helped me move forward. Anyways, overall this is a thank you to everyone who is subscribed and participates in this sub.  It was a great experience being a part of this community.",FortNiteBR

Now, I’m an average-below average player, I know the basics, my aim isn’t terrific and and I can’t do fancy building things like you’d see on twitch.  But I’ve noticed the skill gap getting bigger and bigger through each season, making the game a bit harder each time for medium / low players like me. 

I have around 1300 solo games and *zero* win currently. I do have wins in duos or squads, thanks to my friends carrying me. I’m a really slow learner when it comes to video games, especially the FPS (or TPS) genres so I feel like I’m improving really slowly. 

Do you guys think there’s still hope for players like me ? I guess I’m not the only one in this situation but I need to know if it’s “too late” for me or not.

I've got three items I think should be vaulted. Here goes.

1. Standard Pistol: Honestly, I find this gun pretty insignificant. The only time people really use it is when they have no other choice. Once a better gun is found, it's dropped and never picked up again. The gun is literally buried under a mound of better pistols.
2. Scoped AR: This gun was once a star, but now it's been left behind. When it was buffed, it got a slight boost in usage. But now, it's become just as insignificant as the Standard Pistol. Plus, a lot of people hate it already.
3. Scoped Revolver: Hmm, where do I start? I find this guy pretty garbage. It has decent damage, but the amount of recoil ruins it. In order to be accurate, you have fire slower than a bot can build. I think a lot of us hate this gun for the same reasons.

That's it for this post. If you have any other items you think should be vaulted, please share in the comments.

So with season 9 coming soon i thought id show you my predictions for it. Warning, these are MY predictions. MINE only. If you disagree im fine with it, but be respectful OwO.
1. Tilted will be remade but modern. This seems the most plausible and i really hope it doesnt. u/ellodoods made a good post about why its bad, so i wont go into much detail
2. We are getting new ground consumables. You know like hoprocks? Yeah like that catagory. Ideas could be like coding blocks that make you go fast or drum gun rocks that make you break the game and instantly win. That was a joke btw
3. The c4 and tac smg will be unvaulted. I looked through the vaulted guns, and these seem like the most likely to come back. In contrary
4. The AK will be vaulted. Ever since fortnite COMPLETELY AND UDDERLY FUCKED THAT GUN UP(im still not over it), no one has really used it outside of the early game. So epic will probably vault this
5. We'll get a volcanic/cybernetic tomato town. Ok this one has to happen. Imagine a robotic tomato town. Or a tomato volcano. Ya cant say it wouldnt be dope.
6. Masks will be introduced. This was a concept introduced by a different user. Ill put them here if i remember there name. They said that the head on the desk could be a sign that masks are coming. HOLY SHIT THAT WOULD BE EPIC(games). Imagine a default with an ancient aztec mask or ragnarock with a cyborg mask. 
7. The volcano will flood. So people though that epic was gonna flood part of the map. Boi did that not happen. So my prediction is the volcano will flood with water. All the lava will turn to stone and we'll have a giant volcano that, maybe will become a jungle ruin?i dunno.

And those are it. Thanks for reading and probably non of these will happen. Whatever i guess🤷‍♀️",FortNiteBR

And yet Epic thinks putting console players in a lobby with PC players is fair. I want shield and mats for kills, but having to play at a disadvantage constantly is almost not worth it. I’m very competitive by nature and think I can hang with most players; however, when I can’t even tell what I’m aiming at when trying to pump someone because I’m at 6 fps it just doesn’t feel fair or fun. Building and editing become impossible the further you get into arena which is hilarious considering that’s what creates the skill gap in this game. Every time I try to edit out of a build I drop below 30 frames every time. Totally feels like a competitor experience where the best player wins Epic 👍🏻",FortNiteBR

*Why?* I hear you ask. The answer is simple, it all started on that doomed day in 2019: 8 may. 

I decided to play fortnite back then and found a pleasant surprise, a free glider and 6000 V-bucks! I was amazed and excited. I proceeded to buy everything in the shop that day! 
But then, a day later, I logged in again and saw that my V-buck count was negative. 

I was officially in V-buck debt.

My entire world came crashing down. There was no future for me anymore. I fell into a severe depression.
How was I ever going to pay all these V-bucks back? What was I supposed to do? I’m not from a particularly poor family, not at all, but we really couldn’t afford V-bucks.

But life went on and I graduated from high school. I didn’t have the money to go to college but I managed to make a living by working as a plumber, just like my father. I even got married to a beautiful wife, who gave me two equally beautiful children. 

I was happy again.

But then I received an email from a company I’ve feared for my entire life. Epic Games. 
I was too afraid to open it so I didn’t, I now realize how much of a coward I was. Eventually it took me two weeks before I finally snapped.
I already knew what this cursed email was about, of course. I just didn’t want my family to know about my troubled past. I had wanted to move on from this dark chapter of my life and forget all about it, but it seemed like my past couldn’t let go of me.

Even though Fortnite doesn’t exist anymore, it seems like Epic Games still wants me to pay off my debt. How am I ever going to find enough money to do so? I have to feed my family and pay for my kids’ education! 

I can feel it deep in my bones, I know my life is falling apart again. I can’t keep hiding this secret from my wife, she already suspects something is wrong, I don’t want to sacrifice my marriage or my children. 
I can’t get another job since I’m already too busy right now. We sold everything we didn’t need anymore just to get some more money. I am lost and I don’t know what to do.

As I am typing this, I realize there is only one option left. For the safety of my family I have to run and hide. I don’t know where I will go or how I will survive, but I will manage.

Someday I will meet my family again. Maybe my kids won’t even realize I’m their father, but that doesn’t matter anymore right now. I just want them to stay as far away as possible from this.

I hope I will reunite with them again. When I finally payed off my V-buck debt,",FortNiteBR

That way EPIC could know if the majority actually enjoys default settings.

I know the teaser came out mentioning Tilted and a creative island featured a futuristic Tilted, but that doesn't confirm anything. The creative island likely means nothing, While I can see where people are coming from with the teaser, I have to disagree. Tilted has been in the game for seven seasons, as the #1 drop. They have a new building there that gets destroyed every season. (Besides this one) It's clear they want diversity in the most popular spot on the map. If they obliterate it with volcanic rocks, I doubt it's coming back. It'll be replaced by something else. Pleasant Park could be the new main drop, or Dusty Divot. Or something that comes in season 9. If they want diversity, they won't just redesign the area and make it look cool for two days, then you get used to it. If it's still the main drop, nothing has really changed. I know I could be wrong, that teaser does make plenty of sense, but overall, I just don't see it happening.

I was thinking in what sheer horror must the dwellers of the island live, given every 2-3 months some apocalyptic event of almost cosmic proportions happens: a fucking comet crashes down making a huge-ass crater, some factions having an all-out war and firing rocket in the sky, a giant menacing purple cube rolling around their island, demolishing everything and anybody that dared to cross its path, just to later explode and then bring a new ice age for the island, completely freezing a whole settlement, which in turn led to giant-ass volcano erupting, annihilating 2 new settlements, probably killing thousands in the process. Don't get me started on the poor residents of *that* one building in Tilted.  


All this complemented by not one, but **TWO** zombie invasions in the span of several months AND millions of people viciously and relentlessly murdering one another on a daily basis. No wonder it's actually deserted.   


Now go out there, grab a Thompson gun, build a covered bridge to protect yourself from those adversaries (destroy if you have the time) and continue terrorizing those people.

Have a great day, peace. ✌️",FortNiteBR

Things became real Salty for Fortnite last couple of months.

But why though? Did they really mess up? Or there is something else behind all these?

We can agree to disagree with whatever I say in next  few lines but this is just my thought only.

Are we really having fun with this game? Or are we being lead to believe that Fortnite is not fun anymore?

We are missing out on having fun because we are always expecting something..from Epic or from ourselves.

1. When you see ""1.1m complaining about drum gun"" somewhere in this sub, this only represents the 2% of the playerbase. So ""1.1m complaining about drum gun"" is a demand/expectation from Epic in disguise.
2. K/D. Who cares about that (unless you want to join a clan/team-means you are among 0.01% of the player base). This is an expectation from yourself
3. Epic: ""vault this, this is so OP"". OP for whom? You? or the streamer you watch after being owned?
4. *somewhere in random sqauds: ""*Omg, you are such a bot, he was just one shot dude"". Expectation from others who expect everyone in this world to leave everything and practice shotgun aim in Creative.
5. ""*Omg, my floor did not place, this game is trash"".* Search youtube, there are thousand glitches in every game. Not happy? Try making a simple game of Snake yourself. Expectation of perfection from a free to play game
6. ""*Each update brings new bugs. What's wrong with Epic"".* Try working at 3AM going through hundreds of lines of codes to find where you omitted a fullstop. 

I don't know about you, but from S9, I am going to play the way I want. If I have to  bush camp, I will. I don't want to practice triple ramp rushing. i don't have to. I don't pay any money to EPIC. i don't buy skins/items. (I purchased battle pass twice only). Epic owes nothing, absolutely nothing to us/streamers/competitive players. Don't let them believe that you also hate the game.

Play the way YOU like it. Push everyone you see or dance in the middle of Retail Row. Noone cares. Its important that YOU, only YOU have fun.

Bugs/glitches will always be there. Just hop onto another game.

You see, when the meteor hit and the visitor came, the visitor was the embodiment of the light (Siphon).

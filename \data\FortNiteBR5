So...  Epic. You really haven't learnt? Now, I have Reaper and didn't mind  John Wick cause it barely even looks the same other then the suit. But  Epic. You took a battlepass legendary skin... And made it into a epic  for summer? You took the damn shirt off and you're gonna sell it in the  item shop? If us Drift users don't get this skin or if the new Summer  Brite Bomber skin isn't given to the Brite Bomber users (I do not own  Brite Bomber, just mentioning them.). You guys are really asking for the  spam of people complaining.  What do you all think?

The current state for me is well but ever since they removed stretched resolution, it makes the game harder to play, i don‚Äôt have the best eyes and the FOV we have right now hurts my eyes a lot, I bet a lot of other people agree with me as well. I also don‚Äôt have the best PC and I used stretched res to increase FPS ( I bet even more people would agree) I get that it is an advantage to other players, but it‚Äôs not like we are playing tournaments, a lot of stretched players are casual. I believe that you should unlock the FOV for non competitive modes only, or add an FOV slider please, or at the very least, increase the default FOV to 90-100. I love playing the game but it really hurts to play. I was okay with siphon being put in one game mode, but why can stretched res? I get there are console players and such, but, it‚Äôs just a game, not everything should be fair, some people may have better PC‚Äôs or Worse PC‚Äôs than consoles there will always be advantages and disadvantages, but it‚Äôs how that player uses what he has to make the best of it. Epic you need to stop catering the so called ‚Äúbad‚Äù players, and let them grow by themselves, because a lot of veteran players like myself are getting tired of useless changes, but I get your point, but please can you try to find a solution that will benefit all parties of this matter.

My name is Mark and I‚Äôm from Ghana , Africa. I‚Äôve been playing Fortnite since season 2. As time went on I have come to meet other Ghanaian players who played Fortnite and I can testify that we‚Äôve really grown in numbers. Even more so I‚Äôve come to meet more and more Africans who are like really really good players from Namibia , South Africa , Nigeria , Egypt , Tunisia , Egypt so many other countries.
They‚Äôve formed WhatsApp and Facebook groups were they post their gameplays and trick shots , host custom matches amongst each other all on 200 PING and stream just like we the Ghanaians do and I even got the chance to meet them in real life. I also met some South African kids who were streamers and were controller and keyboard gods I got clapped soo many times by them I couldn‚Äôt believe it .
But the main problem which affected all of us was our connection to the Fortnite Servers unfortunately for us all connected to the European servers which landed us a blistering 200 PING and believe me when I say we don‚Äôt have it easy

Many good players in Africa that I know that started playing from season 1 had to quit because of the ping. Majority of African fortnite players stopped the game entirely due to the ping issue. Luckily for me I get 160 ping it can‚Äôt do much but it manageable to some extent but the South Africans have it worse and they are a lot like really really a lot of people on fortnite 16 hours a day tops.

Africans asking for a server is too much to ask all we need is for the European servers to be tailored to our standings. Fornite has become a place for us to gather and play and socialize and have fun and for that fade away because of the ping issue is just saddening. I don‚Äôt think epic games should see getting Africa better connect to the EU servers as a loss , we spend hundreds of dollars on vbucks also buying skins and emotes at least they should try to keep us hooked on the game üòÇ

All we are saying is that the European servers should be tailored to our standards. Our internet speeds range from 100 MBPS to 700 MBPS and with a little help from epic games we would actually enjoy Fortnite

I know reddit is a very influential social media platform and I believe that our cries and message would get across. Playing on 40 ping won‚Äôt be bad at least üòÇ. There‚Äôs a lot of potential here in Africa.

They remove the weapons that give n00bs like me an opportunity to have fun.  The sweaty's come in force now in Team Rumble and it now feels like the most competitive place ever.  I just played 2 rounds back to back with 16 vs 17 and the opposing team went 150 to less than 100, in both cases in the 80's.  Where is the fun in that?  I come home after a long day at work, I want to pub, not place 1st in the world.  This used to be such a great game to play with my kids, heavy emphasis on ""used to"" since they gave up on this game 2 seasons ago.

My suggestion, unvault everything in Team Rumble.  Make it the pub style that this game so desperately needs.  I've been playing for the last 8 seasons and I have never seen it this bad.  It is not fun for the casual player to get killed, land &amp; immediately get killed again.  Nothing worse than a 3 man shotgun rush right after I land.

Here's another suggestion...limit who can play in the pub LTM by kill count...pick a number of kills and set it so that anyone with more than it (1k, 5k, whatever) can't join the server.

I can't possibly be the only player that feels this way",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

1.) The tournament that people competed in haven't been payed yet and its past its payed date. That Denver guy explains it better  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMOx8LM0hs0&amp;t=538s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMOx8LM0hs0&amp;t=538s)  

&amp;#x200B;

2.) The season 8 event (the one where retail and tilted get destroyed) never happened for a lot of people (the majority in Oceania) and epic apoligized saying they will give away free gliders but I and many of my friends haven't received ours

&amp;#x200B;

3.) Epic doesn't listen to the community -  yet again the season 8 event drum guns and tac smgs were hated but were still in the unvaulting event and yet again they didn't bother listening to the community for removing the drum gun and to this day its still really OP. Epic has never listened and still are money hungry SO MUCH in fact that their game is dying

&amp;#x200B;

4.) They removed the hunting rifle because theres to many snipers yet they brought back the semi auto when no one asked (why couldn't they keep it) and yet again added a new explosive weapon thats to OP. Like why and what about our beloved pumps we loved em and added the new shotgun thats to fast.

But I wanted to share my strategy.

2 slots for guns, rest for sticky bombs. You dont want to do it solo, you want to be in a fill. (Spawns) more zombies.

1st slot an AR
2nd slot an SMG 

I prefer the regular AR and new non burst SMG.

Every round I made sure to keep my multiplier at X4 at all times. Heres my strategy:

Everyone has their own area except during the moving storm rounds. When you have to reload you want to get a kill right before your reload. I usually get a kill reload, get another kill then reload my secondary. Then I go through both magazines. I use my AR to get long distance kills when I dont have a zombie near me to keep my multiplier up. When you absolutely dont have ammo or cant reload, thats when the stickies come into play when kiting.

When collecting stones, you want to use the same strategy for your reloads. Get a kill then collect. The nice thing about stones is they kill everything near you after they are activated so it keeps your combo multiplier up.

Some insight - the bulk of your score comes from the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds. So make these rounds count the most, be on top of your game. With some bots I got 457k team score when I got 200k. Make sure you communicate to your team when you cant get reach stones around the map and have someone else get them.",FortNiteBR

We all remember where we landed to get our first win.

Back when Fortnite first started this was a revolutionary game. The building concept was never brought to Battle Royale games. It was so new and EVERYONE was learning. No one had prior experience, we all had to experiment.

Every player slowly got better, there was only a few players in each lobby that had more experience than the majority. Facing these players were fun. They taught you new tricks, edits, etc.

If only we could reset Fortnite to how it was in Season 1.

Fortnite, In my opinion, in it's current state is below par. I believe that people have ruined for the most part. Yeh Epic has done it's fair share with a lot of bad patches, but players have made it no fun. You'll get 2/3's of the lobby sweating their ass off, while us casual players have no way to contest them. I have and will always played for fun, have around 300 wins, with a 2-3 (Can't remember) KD. The only time I feel that the game in enjoyable is against other casual players who don't crank out 90's in their sleep.

Arena Mode had Siphon which I absolutely love! Why Epic removed that from normal mode, I'll never know. I overall have fun in Arena Duo's the most. One downside is Smurfing. I've had brand new accounts just shit on me, because they aren't in the league that they should be.

If you share or disagree with any of my points, please let me know. I'm open to have my mind changed :D",FortNiteBR

Everyone is Bots. Since your playing with mobile players and other switch players usually everyone aim is off. There using bush camping. Very rare to see an intense build battle. And don‚Äôt get me wrong when you do see someone who knows how to build you sure are surprised. Like seriously. Surprising. 

Also everyone thinks I‚Äôm a god when I build. But it‚Äôs seriously a crappy 90¬∞ build. That takes me some time to do.  (Even on ps4 I don‚Äôt know how to build lmao and I suck on ps4 like really badly)
And when I get a lot of kills they‚Äôre all shock. When I play random squads.

Anyway Tl;DR Everyone so far seems to be bots.

P.S. If you do play switch I recommend the pro controller. But that‚Äôs just if you want a easier time. I don‚Äôt personally usually it but yeah

With the increased no. of surveys regarding building, and epic's proclivity for drastic changes, I feel something bad coming....

Epic, building is the literally the only aspect of the game that should NOT be touched under any circumstances. Just because newer players may find it hard to build in the first few days/weeks of playing does not and will justify altering the mechanic that made fortnite famous. Any significant change made to building WILL be opposed by the community and your game will drastically suffer because of it. You guys stumbled across probably, if not definitely, the best mechanic of any video game ever; the thought of touching it in any major way should not even cross your mind.

Epic, please learn from your past with Paragon that altering your game's core mechanics will drive your game to the ground, no matter how popular it may be.

So here‚Äôs a few problems on switch. 

Mobile and switch players in the same lobbies: I know both switch and mobiles players hate this. I completely understand. Mobile players hate playing against switch players because they have controllers and it brings them a huge disadvantage. Switch players hate playing against mobile players because of auto fire. It seems like all the time i get lazered by a bot that has auto fire on.

FPS issues: It‚Äôs sad that some phones get better fps than switch (a dedicated gaming console). I have and I‚Äôve seen people get as low as 10 FPS and it‚Äôs ridiculous. I think maybe a if they had a setting where you could downgrade the graphics so we could get a steady 30 FPS could fix this problem.

Polygons on landing: It‚Äôs seems like if I land anywhere like Neo Tilted, Mega Mall, Fatal Fields or any other place with a lot of buildings or a lot of players landing there, my textures font load in, resulting in me dying because I can‚Äôt move.

Also a side note, about a year ago when fortnite released on switch it ran great, but it seems like around season 7 or 8 it just all went downhill, and it just got worse in season 9.

There are a few more issues that I could get into but i think I‚Äôll leave it at that. All I‚Äôm asking of Epic is that they could at least try to optimize fortnite on switch better in the future. I have also seen a couple other posts similar to this that are helping spread attention to the problems on switch. Hopefully Epic can bring a fix to all this, but in the meantime lets play some games that the developers actually took time to optimize for switch. Some examples are Wolfenstein, Doom, Rocket League, Skyrim. I can name a few more.

When no one really has mats or shield I feel it is head and shoulders above any other gun due to its versatility range wise as well as fire rate. This wouldn't really be a problem if they were more common, but they aren't easy to find due to their rarity so there's usually just a couple per POI. What I would suggest is that combats move down to gray, green and blue rarity and the tac is vaulted. With this change, it would bring the opportunity to bring the pump back with purple and gold rarity. This will give a viable option to those who prefer the combats versatility and forgiveness over the pumps high risk high reward nature.

The reason Fortnite is dying is because the skill gap has gotten insanely high.  As a casual player (1.2 KD ratio) I'm noticing an influx of 10 - 15 sweaty Soccer skins in each match who absorb most of that matches kills.  

I have no data to support this but I have strong reason to believe that those 10 - 15 sweaty Soccer skins are getting 50+ kills in each match.  This leaves the rest of the casual player base in each match (85 - 90 players) to scrap over the remaining 50 kills.

This is eliminating a good portion of fun to be had by the vast majority of players.  Why play a video game if you can't reliably have fun?

Epic needs to solve this problem if they intend to stop Fortnites fall.  They can do this using two different strategies.

Strategy One: Include an actual functional ranked mode akin to Overwatch, Rocket League, League of Legends etc... Separate players based on their actual skill level.

Strategy Two (less popular here): Keep the player base intact but nerf building and buff certain weapons, items, and high ground.

If Epic doesn't act quick, Fortnite will be a fraction of what it is today a year from now.",FortNiteBR

It has been really tough lately for me to get a kill because of encounters with drum gun users,  In arena it's been just hell with drum guns back.

- Change the elimination count back to the 100

- Once your team reaches 100 eliminations your opponents are still alive but respawns are OFF. If they get knocked and eliminated, they are  eliminated for good.

- If your team has less than 100 eliminations but your opponents have 100, they can respawn as much as possible until you reach your 100 elimination goal.


This way it spices TR up and gives it that Battle Royale type feel.

Kinda long but simple concept.

Unfortunately we will never be able to do anything about it, because these two things have cemented themselves into fortnite, and things will never go back to the way they were. 

Before turbo building and tilted were added, fights were pretty much shooting with mild forts being made to help defend you or give you cover you could duck back into, there were never these crazy build fights and hyper quick editing like you see now, the entire game was like the season 1 trailer everyone has seen.

 Jump to the future where we have tilted and turbo building towards the beginning of season 3, and things have started to change.. You notice that anywhere outside of tilted isnt as full as it use to be, you are noticing people coming from tilted with a lot more kills then people use to have in the mid game, and while everyone was building 1x1s quicker, you would notice a rare few who werent building 1x1s, but instead they would ramp rush you, going in and being crazy fast and they almost always were wearing the reaper. 

As time has gone on more and more people started going tilted for the higher kills, and steadily but surely a decent amount of the playerbase was playing in this new style, high action fast paced building in close quarters combat. This trend grew so much that even people who didnt really enjoy that style of gameplay had to adopt it just to be able to kill anyone, so now everyone is doing it and it has become the norm. 

Sweats as we call them now were given the ability to change the pace of fortnite as a whole because of these two additions to the game. Now i dont blame them, dont get me wrong, but given these two additions, time, and sheer numbers, they turned the game away from just a fun br to breakneck speed br where you have to try your heart out every match or you might as well que for something else.

In short, the game has slowly gotten more competitive since the addition of these two things, making it harder to actually enjoy and just have fun like in the old days, and i think epic realizes this.. I think they realize that while they know the cause of the problems (the problem that the game is not as fun as it use to be) they cant change it, they are too cemented into the game at this point, so they are trying to do other things to make the game fun again, to change the game from what it is now, to back what it use to be, and if you look at things from that perspective, maybe you will see it too. I was annoyed with some of the changes they have been making for the past few seasons but after looking at things in this light, i have seen them in a different way.

POI DESIGN: It‚Äôs a mesh of old and new at the moment, with the latter not fit for this game at all. Epic seem to have completely lost their way in terms of creating a decent POI. Recent additions such as Neo Tilted, Mega Mall and Happy Hamlet don‚Äôt fit the game at all. They contain complicated buildings that take too much time to loot, doorways and awkward spots that completely negate building and extremely slow material gain.


SLIPSTREAMS: It‚Äôs always nice to have ways to navigate across the map faster but slipstreams take it a step too far. If you‚Äôre in any fight within 50m of a slipstream (which is literally 50% of the map) then you‚Äôre going to get third partied constantly. It‚Äôs a running theme this season that as soon as you get into a fight with a slipstream nearby you end up facing wave after wave of teams until you‚Äôre health is so low that you can‚Äôt hold them off anymore.


BIOMES/TERRAIN: Variety is great for the game don‚Äôt get me wrong, but the terrain of the 2 most recently added biomes (snow/jungle) simply doesn‚Äôt fit the game. There‚Äôs a reason why they pull in the lowest number of players every single game than anywhere else on the map. Aside from the fact that they have poor POI‚Äôs, the extremely fluctuating levels of verticality in the terrain in both of these areas makes them unappealing. Of course hills, ravines and valleys can work in Fortnite, but not when they dominate entire biomes. Players despise it. Fortnite thrives off of generally flat landscapes as players create their own verticality the majority of the time though building.


That covers the biggest issues I see currently. Who knows what‚Äôs to come for the map in future seasons, hopefully we see some change. Their old formula was great and they had no reason to make such drastic change.",FortNiteBR

I think the majority of players who play Fortnite, are slowly having less and less fun. I love this game and I always will, but there are some changes that need to be made. Even most casual players aren't enjoying it as they were before, so you can't just say that the changes are better for them.

I (and many others) believe that these are some really important changes that need to be made:

Nerfing the Combat Shotgun - The Combat Shotgun is the best gun to have in every situation: it has a lot of range, it shoots fast, it has high damage. I believe a simple fire rate and range nerf would be very healthy.

Replacing the Tactical Shotgun with the Pump Shotgun - Currently there is no option for shotguns; it is either Combat Shotgun or you die, whereas the Pump Shotgun would be a really good option for Shotguns, depending on the situation, and what you prefered.

Vehicles being disabled after Storm Faze 5 (for Competitive) - Ballers are VERY overused in Competitive play, and I believe simply disabling them (like Slipstreams) would be a healthy addition.

Other Vaults: Burst SMG, Proximity Grenade Launcher, Boom Bow, Semi-Auto Sniper, Drum Gun, Mounted Turret.

Other Unvaults: Silenced SMG, Tactical SMG, Hunting Rifle, Revolver.

It's shrinking because casuals are no longer playing the game like they used to.,"When Fortnite was at it's peak back in Season 6/7, you'd regularly run into a wide variety of players in terms of skill level.

However, the skill gap has gotten so unbearable for bad, new, and casual players that many have simply dropped Fortnite for other games/hobbies.

Now those left still playing Fortnite are running into a higher caliber of player more consistently (and thus dying more frequently).

Instead of blaming their deaths on themselves they blame it on Epic.  However, they're only right partially.  Epic reduced the skill gap not with items, but by driving away bad players.

I‚Äôm a 18 year old guy and used to play Fortnite a lot, and I mean A LOT. I was addicted and played it everyday, in other words I loved it. 

When it was most popular(1-1,5 years ago) I was really good at the game and finishing top 5 every game, always jumping Tilted, always pushing etc...

So, six months ago me and my friends wanted to go back to Fortnite and take a break from Apex and other games.  Furthermore the first thing we notice is that we are much worse at the game. But we fight trough it, and we becomes relatively comfortable.

HERE COMES WHAT I WANT TO SAY

We know Fortnite have made a lot of changes, both good and bad. But know we find Fortnite as a much less skill based game. 
Why? 
(This point don‚Äôt cover pc)
‚ÄúThe Aim assist players have is incredible‚Äù, it can‚Äôt be unnoticed. It‚Äôs almost useless to carry a sniper nowadays because of the capability of the Ars. I can laser a guy, easy from 200 feet. And not to mention shooting and connecting shots while flying which was impossible back in the day. 

(This does)
‚ÄúTransportation is so much easier‚Äù, I see why Epic games creates transportation ways like zip lines, slipstreams and vehicles. It makes it more fun, sure. BUT the drawback of this is that it makes third parrying possible in a whole new level. Additionally from the previous point that you can shoot from miles away. The playstyle I have (pushing like a maniac) is not possible. 

Also, Something really irritating is the bloom which we all have. It‚Äôs all luck and punish all players. It‚Äôs completely random. Remove it and the good players that are actually hitting its target are rewarded. 

These are the two major problems with Fortnite and Makes the game freaking terrible. And yes I know Fortnite targets a younger age and adjust it to fit their skills bla bla bla. But freak.

SOLUTION: 
Make a game mode with the old map old weapons, old op:s and Old gameplay. Bring back greasy, pump (not dubble pump) retail. And no brutal aim assist for console. If they could remove all the stupid vehicles and For instance rifts I would be grateful.  The list goes on. 

Thank you for reading and please if you feel the same way or not, comment. Also if I forgot something.",FortNiteBR

Epic needs to either add true SBMM or drastically reduce the skill gap if Fortnite is to remain the biggest game on the planet.,"We all know Fortnite is plummeting in terms of popularity and I suspect most of us know why.

There's simply too many players in each match who get 8, 9, 10+ kills.  Yesterday, I had a player with 22 kills kill me.  No thanks.

If each match has a handful of those players it leaves too few kills for us casual players to have any fun.  If the casuals aren't having fun, they stop playing.

And before anyone says ""Just practice"", no it doesn't work like that.  Casual players would rather spend time working on their school, career, or family than do 90s in playground all day.

Epic needs to do something before the tryhards sweats ruin Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

I've been waiting for it, impatiently at this point along with T-Pose, since I started playing last season. I was told it was a holiday skin somewhere on Reddit, but, its been in the shop twice (Dec 28-29 + sometime in Feb for two days again), so if it was an Xmas skin, it wouldn't have been in the shop in Feb, right? So i'm just assuming its a normal rotation skin, that just hasn't been in the shop for a minute.

You guys' opinions?",FortNiteBR

https://i.redd.it/29tzbw5jdq431.png

After working on a concept for one of my own skins, Furi/Phuri, I decided to create a 3D version to showcase what the skin would actually look. The model itself is composed of 10+ model pieces from various games, obviously including Fortnite, but also including some things like the hair that I had to convert from Sims myself. Some parts you might recognize are the main torso being from Kumiko, the right arm piece from Bolt, the pants of Whiteout, and the face of Skully. All work was done in Blender, but only took around 4 days since I've worked with Blender for about 7 years now! Some parts of the design have changed a little, but not everything on paper looks perfect once it becomes. I can't wait to share more of my creations now that I'm back to working in Blender, cheers! \^\^",FortNiteBR

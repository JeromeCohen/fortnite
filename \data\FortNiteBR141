I play cross-platform with my friends and they just don't like playing with me anymore, and I'm starting to HATE playing the game too because you just feel completely helpless against people who has 5-6 kda when you have barely 1 kda or less. I've played countless of games. I've played playground to practice. I have won some games, but we feel like we just peaked, we can't improve anymore. I don't get why we don't play against people who are just at the same level or just A BIT above. 


I'd rather play against 75 players than playing against 100 players which at least 60 will be able to kill me without looking at the screen, I just want to play a game in the regular mode where I don't get smashed. We have played for 3 hours today and we only had 1 decent game where we got 2 kills... The rest of them? First couple we got across, they'll build the Taj'Majal in 3 seconds before we can even build a double ramp, then procceed to spam sniper heavy pistol and burst us with their scar... It's just horrible. If it's not that, then they'll rush us with their grapplers and one shot us.

But, nowadays, we go around bming each other because we are thirsty for kills, just like any pvp game out there. We all complain about it, but do it too, one way to stop that is by all of us doing our part.

From your beloved community. You are an amazing company. You listen to your fans, you made a child’s concept come true, and most importantly, you have continued to provide access to the worlds most popular game on virtually every platform. 
But it’s time everyone needs to start confronting actual issues. I love fortnite. It’s a very scalable game and runs on almost every piece of hardware you throw at it. But it comes to a point where we begin to see less effort and more laziness. I’m pointing fingers at fortnite on the Nintendo Switch. 

When fortnite launched on switch, it worked, it felt at home, it wasn’t too watered down but also wasn’t too extra. It struggled a little bit, but it was fortnite, it was fun, and almost every switch owner can say the same.

The trees actually blew in the wind. The resolution actually stayed stable 80% of the time, and being in tilted didn’t seem like I was trying to run the game on an N64. Nor’ did the models fail to render, or never did the game choke when literally building a 1 by 1. It all went down hill when season 5 launched. Data streaming issues, Major hitches, crashing, buildings and entire chunks of land not rendering fast enough, being stuck on a loading screen for 3 minutes only for it to finish to you free falling at the edge of the map where the bus ended. 
Getting into a simple build fight caused the frames to drop from a stable 30 down to 15. And since then you have made tiny efforts to burry some of these issues, some you ignore, and some just don’t make any sense. It’s sad we have a developer that has gotten fortnite running at 60fps on a smartphone but can’t get an actual console version of the game running at 30. Even DOOM runs better and looks better than fortnite on the switch AND Doom has video capture now and still manages to implement amazing fixes to the game. 

The switch version of fortnite is treated so poorly. I feel like there’s just no sign of effort. A quick port of the mobile version of the game fitted with a console UI not optimized correctly for the switches hardware. We even have a game like Paladins running at 60fps and still manages to look better than fortnite. I know the switch isn’t a super powerful machine but it also isn’t weak either. The game should max out 30fps almost all the time. Even removing the video capture that people loved, did absolutely nothing for performance. We don’t even have stats or leaderboards which is literally proof that it’s just a sloppy port of the phone game. The game just gets worse with every patch regardless of the fact they claim they “fix” data streaming issues. 

Maybe epic should just hand the actual Xbox one and PS4 Versions of the game to panic button and let them have at it. And what’s sad is people are buying switch bundles with vbucks and a special skin only to be greeted with a crappy performing game. 

To all my switch players. You are not alone. Although I play on Xbox one with keyboard and mouse, my girlfriend can’t even run duos with me without struggling in the most simple of situations. 

I hope you guys agree, I hope you know you are not alone. And here’s to hoping that epic does something about this terrible port of a game. Switch players deserve so much more for how much some of them probably dedicate their time and money to this game. ",FortNiteBR

Remove the gun from the plane. If you want to shoot while in the air, switch seats. You can still boost and such, the health stays the same, but if you run into any kind of building, the plane blows up and you take 50 damage. This punishes trying to kamikaze somebody as you start the fight with 50 health off. You may still boost through obstacles such as trees and “possibly” non player built structures, but you take a hefty amount of vehicle damage. In reality, it isn’t very hard to shoot a plane down unless it’s early game, but with these changes you don’t really have a need to shoot it down in the first place. Any suggestions on this idea, let me know. We could all create the perfect plane experience. ",FortNiteBR

Let's be real, even with the shotgun (pump) buff, you still pretty much have to carry a ""switch-to"" weapons like submachine guns.

I think that there should only be blue to gold submachine guns. Compact smg is already fairly balanced, I'm just sick of smgs in almost everyone's inventory. They should just be rarer. Or re-add the Tactical SMG. It was the most balanced. Not 120% accurate, good damage, maybe add a lower clip size, wasn't a complete laser.

(my first post on here because this is really important to me)","I played this game since almost day one and i have to say its the best game ive ever played in my life! I played many pvp games like cod mw/bo, halo and gears for hundreds of hours but nothing was comparable to the mix of fun and challenging gameplay fortnite provides. I played this game for over a year now EVERY SINGLE DAY for multiple hours and today i reached a point where i just had to quit it because of the nonsense that is going on atm that is frustrating me so much!  
I understand that epic wants to provide fun to players that dont have multiple hours to play this game every day and are not as good at aiming or building as others may be. But there is to much going wrong right now! Planes, punishing for fast switching of weapons and editing, pickaxe making 20 damage to player for no reason, hitches and a general unsmoothnes since season 7, rpgs still beeing abused at close encounters and more stuff. I would really love to see epic focusing more on the quality of the game than on new content every other week. You guys have satisfied the people that want new content more than enough! Fixing some (or all) of the problems i mentioned above would make so many people happy because i see so many members of this community beeing frustrated right now.

So please Epic, Vault the Planes (nobody has asked for them) or at least buff the spawnrate heavily because now every early game there are some guys with no weapons in a plane spamming at you and trying to hit you with the plane.

Nerf RPGs against players because they are clearly an item ment to counter builds (wich is totally fine) and not shooting at an enemy in the same room killing yourself too in the process.

Revert pickaxe damage to 10 because it cant be that i have to pickaxe every player that lands on the same house as me to not get killed by him even if i would be at the chest or weapons spawn much faster.

And finally do something about those small hitches that occur (i play on fiber with 15 ping early game and about 1-5 ping mid to end game so connection should not be the issue) all the time, especially if there are enemies nearby.

I hate so say it but if this stuff (mostly the planes) stays in the game or even worse, more things like this get added me and my friends have to stop playing this game. Because it is just to frustrating for us puting in hours to train aim and building and constantly thinking of new ways to outplay enemies and then getting killed by the guy that cant even aim properly but spams rpgs or the guys spamming us with 2 planes early game in retail (happens every time retail is hotdrop).

So i say it one last time in this post, PLEASE EPIC, make this game great again, make it be about skill, mindset and creativity not about fly or die, spray and pray, just build and other noob tactics!

PS. This post is critiquing you, epic, and since this is my first post i dont want to be all negative! I have to add that i had some of my best times with friends during a time in my life that i was struggling really hard, in fortnite. All the stuff you guys added and came up with is really amazing and i have great respect for you guys keeping up the good work and listening to your community so much. You really created something wonderfull and unique here, thank you very much for this. I really hope to spend another 1000 hours in this game and enyoing them like i have in the past!

4) Planes should have half the health points they currently have OR health points should scale depending on the playlist. An example would be that planes would have half the health they currently have when playing solos but more than half health in squads. Supply drops currently use this mechanic already.

5) Planes should deal at least 50 HP to all passengers when exploding

6) Jumping out of an airplane should not trigger a glider

Hey [r/FortniteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBR),

I'm [Gene](https://twitter.com/GenePark/status/1073647141527146503), a social media editor from The Washington Post, and I'm doing an op-ed arguing why Fortnite was the single biggest pop cultural phenomenon of 2018. It's an end of the year look back at how the game absolutely dominated conversation all year round across all mediums and ages. Fortnite touched every cultural hotspot, from music to sports to even a cringey SNL segment.

I'd love some comments from the subreddit looking back at the past year. Some questions I'd love to hear answers for:

1. Why do you think Fortnite dominated pop culture so much more than probably any game before it?
2. Why do you keep playing?
3. What is your overall assessment of the Fortnite community? In the grand scheme of things, it's fairly new (since it's still a new IP), but it's huge, influential (cross play from Sony!).
4. Where do you see the game, and the community, going in 2019?

Thanks in advance for all input and conversation, and you'll bet I'll be trying to include as much as I can, and I'll also link back to the thread so everyone else can read it too.

I'll be in the thread responding to folks as well. Looking forward to the discussion! - Gene",FortNiteBR

After the addition of the pump shotgun buff gun play has never been more balanced.  Both shotties and smgs have their place in the game play without being OP in either direction, and the only thing left to do is make planes less OP. This can come from a variety of changes.

1. Planes need to do 50 damage upon explosion to those on it.  This was CONFIRMED by Mr Popo on Twitter!!!!

2. Damage to plane users after smashing builds

3. Removal of machine gun on the plane

4. Players cannot be completely run over by the plane resulting in instant death (100 damage instantly)

5. Refueling planes

6. Slightly lower plane speed

7. Players can't be thrown far distances after being hit by a plane resulting in fall damage deaths.

(Not all of these changes at once or planes will be really unhelpful)

WE'RE SO CLOSE TO A WELL BALANCED GAME!!! EPIC DONT MESS THIS UP.",FortNiteBR

I believe the same thing the majority of this community does, being that feedback to Epic is how we work to get a better game and fix problems. **That being said,**why do we turn on them so fast? I've seen multiple posts over the last 3 days saying that Fortnite is now a ""dead game"" and Epic is a greedy money-hungry company, yet a week ago when Season 7 released everyone had a completely different perspective. Of course I know a lot has happened in these past few days and trust me, the outrage is well deserved, but on the scale it's at now I feel like it's all just a bit much. Epic has done so much for the gaming community as a whole and I really think we've begun to take that for granted. I know I'm most likely going to get loads of hate for this and I'll probably regret putting my opinion out there, but I just really wanted to know if anyone else felt the same way. And if not, why?

Blitz LTM finally made its return last season, after we had not seen it for several months. The LTM returned for a short period of two days during the middle of a week and was available for squad play. It was quickly removed and replaced with Disco Domination which has already been an active LTM for quite some time during season 6. Generally all LTM's stay live in game for one or multiple weeks, and rotate between solo, duo and squads. Blitz was literally here for two days and removed. I do not believe Epic ever addressed this and I would simply like an explanation as to why.

Why do other LTM's get a different treatment than Blitz? Why bring it back in the first place if it's only going to stay for two days and not even be available on the weekends when most people have excess time to play? Although I do not always participate, I love to idea of LTMs. They provide a change of pace from regular play and personally Blitz is my favorite LTM Epic have ever released. The 15 minute max game time is refreshing and great if you have time constraints or simply prefer a quicker/fast paced style of play. While more active chest/ weapon spawns adds a bit less RNG when hotdropping into contested areas. I was super excited when it returned, but because it was here for such a short time I hardly even got to enjoy it with my squad - let alone play solo or duo Blitz which was extremely fun when they were rotated in several seasons ago.

I would love to hear your thoughts and opinions on both Blitz LTM and why it was here for such a brief moment, and I would love to see Blitz make a proper return sometime in the future rather than a two day tease.",FortNiteBR

* If the planes blows up while it is kamakazing a structure the player and its teammates  get a Dmg of 50 health directly.

In the recent patch, Epic introduced a new Mythic weapon to the game: the Infinity Blade, a homage to the Infinity Blade series. Its inclusion has been controversial and has sparked heated debates online, particularly within this subreddit. In an effort to both allow this feedback to be heard and to ensure the subreddit isn't dominated solely by sword-related posts, we have created megathreads. We do this for most additions to the game because the subreddit is often saturated with posts. If we do not remove constant complaint posts or requests that the sword be moved into an LTM, that is all the subreddit will consist of. It is our responsibility to ensure that all discussion is seen and one subject doesn't dominate the forum. 


A large faction of the mod team does not like the sword either, but we see no benefit to allowing the spam of threads that provide no new talking points, and no additional value to the discussion. We believe a megathread allows individual points the exposure they deserve, while also maintaining the subreddit's cleanliness. We have also made Epic aware they can find feedback in the megathreads. If we need to revisit this strategy, we will.

The competitive mode that exists is great (though I think mat caps should be accompanied by increased farming rates) but when the balance changes literally every week willy-nilly it ruins players who are taking the game seriously.

I do not know how feasible this is but I believe there should be a separate mode where item additions take at least a couple of weeks to arrive after they're introduced to the main mode. Splitting the user base into two shouldn't be much of a problem when your userbase is this huge and it would be the way to satisfy the player base. I don't even think balance changes should go straight into this mode, but I agree that is debatable. Just let the people who take the game seriously compete in a different environment to those who just want to have fun and new shit every week without caring about the wins. You're slowly destroying your game and once the best players leave because of it the rest of the playerbase will soon follow. You might think big streamers are not important for the game's health but I guarantee they are. Please don't Paragon this one, it's my favourite game in the past few years and I wish to play it for years to come but, frankly, I have no desire to do so right now.

Even after hundreds of hours, i never got bored playing.

However, what really stood out to me most was not the gameplay, it was the fact that you guys at Epic always seemed to **listen to your community and act accordingly**. Unlike other companies, you were open to suggestions and listened to complaints. (e.g. slurp juice rework, balanced shotguns, glider redeploy, orange justice and many more..)

With that being said, your latest response was a huge **slap in the face** for all of us!  
It came out very clear what the majority of the playerbase wants and you seriously respond by talking about some ""change of gamestyle""-rubbish and announce the exact opposite? Like, wtf??

Thats´s definitely not the response we were hoping for, not the fornite that we love, and most certainly not the EpicGames i used to know.

They've made mobility for getting to the circle so much easier and even though they currently take no damage when crashing into things, that can easily be fixed. If you're being shot at by one you can move into natural cover (harder to break with a plane) or just spam build everywhere (which is what most people do when they get shot at anyways). 

Not to mention if you break a plane while somebody is in it, it's an easy 25 damage to each person inside and you can laser them while gliding out of the sky if your aim is good nd bloom is in your favor. 

Also, for the people complaining about people just flying in them till endgame, literately break them and the people inside have nowhere to go and you can laser them even easier than midgame because they'll be floating down from the sky with not much space to move to. 

Let me know what you think of my opinion, because I think this would be an interesting discussion.",FortNiteBR

I just want to name some of the things I'm referring to when I say bugs/issues and I know I'm probably missing a couple of key ones as well:
-Address ping/packet loss increase
-Address turbo build delay
-Shotgun not shooting/ghost shooting
-Taking damage through ramps
-End game/kill delay
-Players stuck in gliding animation while on the ground
-Zip line death fling
-Airplane bail out with no way of gliding

Planes, turrets, dynamite, the new item (can't say it or this post  will be taken down) and the lag is so bad.

They brought re-deploy in the game, which allowed third partying so badly, they removed it, I got a little excited again. Vaulted bouncers and clingers, which were both my favorites of their categories.

Now they bring in planes that can shoot, with re-deploy... why not take out the shooting and take out re-deploy.. make it a traversal vehicle which you have to land safely....

Third partying is back stronger than ever with planes third partying build fights (which are ridiculous anyway) and a weapon that is completely out of place in this game. They should've just made it a chest drop legendary first melee weapon, that just does normal damage and can be equipped alongside other items in your utility belt.

I spent 1000's on this game since season 1. I honestly wish they would think more about making the game more fun, and not more stressful. I don't regret spending all that money on hundreds of cosmetics, but it's a shame if I end up leaving because the developers are too incompetent, even if they are ""listening"" as one of the best devs out there.

Are there any season 1/2 players that feel exactly the same way? I think I am just going back to Dark Souls again.. boy my life sure is going to feel empty haha....",FortNiteBR

The planes are loud as hell, there's no way you'll get caught off guard by one.

The ones flying the planes are sitting ducks as far as their characters go. The planes dont move that quickly that you can't keep your crosshair on the guy flying it.

The person flying it cant build. And it takes a few seconds for them to get out.

If they try to shoot at you, they have to be flying at you, defending against it with builds is easy enough. You sidestep the plane and that gives you full access to the entire backside of the pilot, they can't do ANYTHING to quickly get themselves out of that situation.

The planes are easy to destroy. Period.

Getting on an enemies plane spells doom for whoever is flying it. And its even easier to do so against bad players, and you know for a fact that any player who uses a plane for combat is bad. 

Sure it can destroy builds, but so can literally everything else, sure it can be annoying when it third parties you, but the outcome wouldn't change whether they have a plane or not.

Stop calling the planes overpowered, they aren't, just learn to adapt on how to counter them, and its not that hard to do so.",FortNiteBR

It seems though that it’s better because whether you or your partner take the big potion doesn’t matter to the overall team health, it will go from 200HP, 50 SHD to 200HP, 100SHD no matter who takes it, but chances are the next type of shield your team will come across is small potions and they only way your team could utilize the small potions were if you took the big potion, not your teammate.

Most games generally have monthly changes and even then many things can be left unchanged. Epic patches this game weekly generally fixing most bugs or working to adjust things quickly. What doesn’t get fixed usually is communicated on. All of this on top of adding new content to keep the game fresh. The tight rope walking they do is seriously impressive. This rarely happens in any other game.

For example I’m also an avid Destiny 2 player and they have much longer dev cycles. Even so guns or things can remain unbalanced for months. Hell sometimes things are broke for years. On top of that generally there’s not much communication between fans and the devs. 

Tl;dr: I think we could all stand to give Epic some time before we burn the damn sub to the ground. Try to remember how good we’ve got it and be patient. They listen and generally act quickly and accordingly. Please just chill out. ",FortNiteBR

It doesn't make sense that a quick melee attack does more damage than a 200 pound electrified sword slamming into your face from 20 feet up in the air with the power of God and anime.

Playing this game was one of the best decisions I ever made. I’m not a pro. Hell, even though I started the first week of season 3, my k/d is probably like 1. I’m the John Wick you can destroy. 

But I don’t care about stats. What I do care about is that I was able to reconnect with my old friend through this game. I was even able to clutch up a squad victory in late season 6 that gave my 8 year old cousin his first win. I literally ran through my house screaming when that happened out of excitement for him. Top 10 memory of my life. 

As much as Fortnite has done for me, I can’t play anymore. The sword and planes and general disrespect for community input has sucked all the fun out of this game for me. 

But with that said, I truly want to thank epic for what this game has done for me. It’s helped relieved my stress. It’s helped me reconnect with an old friend. It’s helped me establish relationships with my young cousins.

Like you all I love this game and have been playing before the first battle pass. I’ve seen this game go through massive changes since then, some good, some great, and some bad. For the first time Epic has made 2 changes that, in my opinion, are down-right awful and I can’t stay silent and just “let it be” like past bad updates (Ex: turrets, nerfing materials, redeploy, pump delay, etc)

Those two changes are the sword (which doesn’t need to be completely removed! Just put it in a LTM), and the planes (drivers aren’t punished nearly enough when driving into the ground/builds)

**With the recent post from Epic saying the sword will stay and other Mythic weapons will be added, I think we should try and get together as a community and find a day where we don’t choose not to play. I think if a lot of the big name content creators and a percentage of this subreddit got together to boycott the game Epic might get the idea just how much the community is against the sword.**

We fell in love with this game because of the unique building aspect of the game, the sword and planes just completely take that feeling away - to the point it is almost no longer the game I originally fell in love with.

FYI I’m completely aware that I can just stop playing, and I plan on it, but I’d much rather this game succeed so I can go back to enjoying the authentic Fortnite experience that Epic made just over a year ago.

Thanks for reading, and what do you guys think?

  This next few items of ""proof"" are slightly more far-fetched but can still be looked into!

&amp;#x200B;

[Proof #5 - This icon in the S8 BP is a Sun, a common symbol of a tropical setting. Also... sunlight melts Snow into the water... something a large portion of the map is covered in right now. ](https://i.redd.it/hhfzaze1u5421.png)

[Proof #7 - The most far-fetched piece of evidence by far. But bananas. A common fruit found on palm trees. Tropical Trees. Trees usually found on Tropical Islands. ](https://i.redd.it/cdvedob1v5421.png)

  Is this 100% certain? No. However, I strongly believe that Season 8 will feature a heavy tropical/underwater theme. Thank you for your time. ",FortNiteBR

I have an idea on how to nerf it. Feedback is welcome.,"According to a post by Epic games earlier this evening, they plan on adding more mythic items to the game. They are not going to back down from this until it’s too late. They also stated they plan on nerfing the sword by removing the ability to build. The building isn’t the problem, it’s the lunge. Here’s my idea(copy and pasted from their original thread)

No gun or weapon should give a player a significant advantage over another player, at all. Wanna keep the sword? Fine. Here’s how to nerf it. Give the lunge a 3-5 second cool down so people don’t destroy a whole building in less than 10 seconds. Playing in duos and squads mean you’ll have 1-3 other people shooting at your squad while you have to spam build for your life because the guy with the sword happens to be ruining whatever builds you put up to PROTECT yourself! Make it so the sword player has to THINK before rushing into a squad. The lunge is the biggest problem. To balance this change, keep building in but give the player holding the sword a mat cap of 300-500 per material. I really hope the other mythic items aren’t this game breaking from the start and FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY don’t test them out before a major tournament. It’s literally a slap in the face to all the pro players that spent hours practicing.",FortNiteBR

Your game lacks any sense of consistency at this point. Seasons 0-3 were unbelievably amazing and you had created a really well balanced game. Double pump needed to be nerfed and you went to far in nerfing pumps into oblivion. Season 4 was where things went to far. Guided missile? Really?

Then the drum gun. Tbh building is too strong now because smgs were too strong, then you nerfed smgs and removed the drum gun. But then you fix shotguns.

Now you bring in planes and a God mode sword! You dont care about the competitive nature of your game. The proof is in the pudding.

I'm honestly pissed because I was once so used to one shot pump meta and I was decent. Then I finally got adjusted to an SMG meta and you bring back what I was used too?

Make up your mind Epic! Do you want a bull shit game with no balance or a fine tuned game with a competitive edge? I for one think you should focus on balancing your game for a season or two and fix the countless glitches in your game. Your pockets are too filled though to stop milking novelty though. So I'll just uninstall your game and reminisce on what it once was. 

P.S. The sword is just first mythic item. Here's an idea for the devs! Add a tank to season 8. Mic drop bye.",FortNiteBR

- planes! This is my biggest complaint and has ruined playing for me. This sums up my thoughts, my brother got second in our squad game when he was last one left against 3 teams of 4. All he did was fly in circles “under” the map along the ocean side and didn’t come up till there were 3 others left and the circle moved. That should never happen, planes take forever to be shot down and besides taking 25dmg there is no downside to using them. In fact you have the biggest advantage in game.

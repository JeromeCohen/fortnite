Or just a bunch of random memes and clips that contribute NOTHING to the overall improvement of the game? I see more stupid, useless things posted here, than people sincerely wanting changes to be made. I am sure I will get a lot of backlash, but I honestly think this should be used soley for getting feedback on changes and updates, as well as getting suggestions from fans. Not memes and clips. I have seen small clips of someone hitting a shot and get thousands of UPs, compared to a post about a serious change that needs to be made to make the overall game better, and it gets nothing but hate. I am most likely in the minority here. Can someone please clarify a little bit for me?",FortNiteBR

- Dragon eggs under the castle just like the mith on the books (they say that are eggs under the big ice wall).

- Ice King just like Night King.

- Fortnite's 7 kings as on GoT 7 kingdoms.

What you guys think about it? Just random easter eggs or an possible official partnership (just like Marvel). As a huge GoT fan, this would be so awesome!!!

\-Upon landing, I cannot even swing my pickaxe or fire my weapon.

\-Randomly my weapon won't stop firing.

\-Creative Voice Chat: You still have yet to add functionality to speak to your friends when in FFA creative, let alone it after playing one FFA it wont let you speak again unless you leave the match and join back. 

\-Probably a ton more I am forgetting or I do not even know exist yet.

146,SovietPoolr,1547579373,agbzy1,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/agbzy1/the_cube_survived/,1,The cube survived?,"I have a theory that the notorious cube is not yet finished with the fortnite island, in fact Kevin only left for a short period of time. I think that Kevin returned to the island at the beginning of the season with the iceberg and here's why:  
We have seen that the cube was able to change phase from a solid to liquid, demonstrated by him dissolving into a liquid at the lake late season 5 and then forming back into the original cube shape just days later at the start of season 6. This ability to change form plays an important role a little later in the season leading up to the butterfly event when the cube started to leak? Kevin's purple color is what I assume to be the energy behind the cube and this is what was discarded into leaky lake leaving behind a shattered shell of the cube which was destroyed during the butterfly event leading to the assumption that Kevin passed. But couldn't it be a possibility that he simply changed form once more to liquid and left behind this old shell? 

  
Of course, none of us knows where the mysterious hole in the center of leaky lake lead to though it would not be unreasonable to think that this hole took these drops of the cube's energy out to the sea surrounding the island and swept them out to someplace much colder. This brings me to just a few weeks ago, the end of season 6 when we saw an iceberg &amp; castle begin to approach the island and finally arrive to the map named ""Polar Peak"".  


So how does polar peak relate to Kevin in any way? My theory is that Kevin the cube's energy seeped out of him and was taken out to sea where he froze and became a part of the iceberg on the island, this makes a little more sense after a tweet from the official fortnite twitter where they said ""Kevin?"" when quoting a post about a cube-shaped sheet of ice at sea. Link: [http://prntscr.com/m7maaa](http://prntscr.com/m7maaa). 

  
With the addition of a transparent sphere of ice above Polar Peak in the recent v7.2 update, there are many things similar to the cube that could put Kevin as the mastermind behind what is to come. This sphere at Polar is seen to be hovering with a vortex of wind around it... just like Kevin when he flew around the island with a slightly larger vortex. Simply looking at this sphere also plays some all too familiar sounds that are a lot like those emitted by the cube. On top of this, there are also in-game files, that have been data mined by leakers, which hold a future event that sounds much like fortnitemares where the cube caused cube fiend monsters to spawn around the map and there were a number of challeneges focused on taking them out yielding some small rewards and at the end, a glider. The new event has challenges that seem to be focused, again, on killing ice themed monsters in order to recieve a free glider. Kevin spawned monsters in the past so, is he about to do it again?  


TL;DR I believe that Kevin survived the 'butterfly' event and the cube's energy is now stored in a mysterious ice sphere above Polar Peak and is going to bring chaos to the island once again.",FortNiteBR

Even in their current state, the planes still give so much advantage to their users over ground players with little punishment.
The punishment for going through buildings, the machine gun overheat/spread, and even the damage taken when the plane explodes is just not enough, as it's so easy to jump out of the plane just right before it explodes, while as a ground player, you have to handle the machine gun bullets, then deal with the plane knocking you off your builds, and then dealing with the pilot who can redeploy their glider and position themself (take highground) with no struggles. 
I have seen many streamers and pro players complaining about the same thing, so please do something.  I know it's good for mobility in the game, and I'm not asking for it to be removed, but for any possible fixes and improvements.
I'd suggest a few adjustments that I think might help solve this issue:
1- Disabling glider redeploy when jumping out of the plane or make it only possible at certain heights 
2- Increasing the time it takes to exit the plane
3- Planes can't go through builds
4- Nerf machine gun damage against players, or slower attack speed with higher damage against buildings, making it less effective against players, and more against buildings.

Thank you for reading, and please feel free to add any suggestions you thing would help solve this issue.

So i ran a few tests, seeing how long it takes for it to ""reach"" 1 million health, one while pickaxing, and one while not. Not the most accurate information in the world, but i figured it would do something. 
For both tests, i got around 7.3 seconds. I would do this on a larger scale, getting multiple squads in on it at once, but my lonely self will have to do for now.
I then multiplied that number up by 3890 (remembering it takes 7 seconds for a million to go down, this was the roundest number at the time), for a total of around 7.5 hours.

there is simple not enough of a risk factor when using planes, in fortnite the meta is always changing and epic seems to be pushing for planes to be the new meta, it is the exact same thing the sword, too easy to use, no risk and way too powerfull, sure ramming people will effect shields over hp but it is absolutely ridiculous that EPIC are literally encouraging ramming by acknowledging that its in the game and barely doing anything about it

the fact is before this update if i got rammed by a plane it would usually be the fall damage that kills me, there is still waay too much knockback on planes and they shouldn't be used as weapons, they are vehicles that should be used simply to get around the map

I like the first shot accuracy for ice, but I don’t like the cooldown for the Minigun. When are you ever going to use a Minigun for less than 6 seconds? The whole point of a Minigun is to tear down builds. I also like that vehicles now hit your shields instead of your health now. I personally am not a fan of the redeploy, if they add it in at all, it should be that everyone spawns in with maybe 5 or 10 charges, and not leave it to RNG like everything else in the game.

1. Skill Gap: The skill gap has increased so much that this game is basically unapproachable for beginners or casual players. I recently started playing for Season 7 and have logged about 150 matches between Solos, Duos, and Quads. To put this in perspective I'm a pretty good gamer in general. I'd say after about 20-50 hours, on average, with a game, I can compete at a reasonably high level. This includes games like Halo, CS:GO, and Overwatch. Not saying I can be Pro level good in that short amount of time but I can be well above average. Despite this, I'm still getting decimated in Fortnite. There's nothing I can do. I'd easily have to log another 2 or 3 hundred games playing 5+ hours a day just to have a shot at winning. Every game, I've been killed by some Ninja wannabe who's injected G-Fuel into their eyeballs and builds the Taj Mahal in about 2 seconds flat. My only hope is to catch them with a lucky DB headshot when they drop down and that usually doesn't happen. If this trend continues, you'll see casual players leaving in droves and the few people who haven't played it won't waste their bandwidth downloading it. 
2. Constant Changes: This game's meta seems to change pretty often. I played off and on during seasons 2-5 and every season required markedly different play styles to be competitive. I don't think anyone disagrees that this is a real phenomenon being programmed in by Epic. They also add in a lot of new items that can take time to learn to use effectively and consistently counter. This can be a good or bad thing depending on the item and who you ask. For example, planes, can be fun as hell. I got in a WWII style dogfight with another player and managed to win that skirmish. I was having a blast doing it and thought it was great Battlefield-esque element to add to the game. On the other hand, grapplers have made my experience measurably worse. I was in a rare 1v1 where I was actually winning the build fight and my opponent was able to just grapple above me and shotgun me in the head while in midair. In another instance, I got third partied by someone who was able to just grapple up above me and get the DB headshot while my sights were trained on someone else. It happened faster than I could react and once they were above me, I had no sense of where they were. My point is, the only people who can keep up with constant meta changes and learning the counters to everything are the players who have 5+ hours a day to dedicate to the game and are probably streamers trying to monetize their content. And that leads me to my next point...
3. Streamers: Everyone and their dog is trying to monetize their game play these days (I can't blame them, it's better than a 9-5 if you make it) and it's created a super toxic environment where so many people are super sweaty tryhards. I've been no-scoped from at least 100 yds away twice in the last week. It wasn't a lucky shot either, the dude was dialing it in, and taking a practiced shot. Everyone wants to be the next Ninja. And while I can respect a person who wants to achieve success in an atypical profession, it's tough for the majority of us who are on the other side of their shotgun barrels. This kind of atmosphere will drive away the core player base and only the uber competitive pro players and streamers will be left battling among themselves to see who can Taj Mahal the other player first for the most views on Twitch. 

You can say ""get gud"" but that doesn't shield the game from the realities that are bound to set in. I've heard possible solutions to these problems but I doubt any of them will do any good. This game has run it's course and it's only a matter of time before it falls out of vogue. Don't be sad, though. It happens to every game that's ever been made and will always happen to every game that will ever be made. It's the normal order of things. I just predict it will happen sooner rather than later for Fortnite. ",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

I speak for everyone when I say that your mini shield nerf is a joke.

&amp;#x200B;

We can carry 3 full shields which gives us 150 shield whenever we need it. with 6 mini's we can get the same amount of shield but we can only heal to 50 shield.

Reason: No long range weapon so I try keep my fights close hence why a shotgun is in my first slot

Or

- Sniper/Hunting Rifle - AR - Shotgun - SMG - Medkit/ Shields 
Reason: I can play the long range fight with the sniper/ hunting rifle followed by the AR and if I land a lucky shot I’ll ‘try’ rush the other guy.

An average player can edit out of a 1 by 1 in 1.5-2.5 seconds, only doing 15-25 damage. Let’s take a stack of stink bombs (6) and use it on 1 player, doing 30 damage per 1/2 a second. Even if the player gets hit once by each stink bomb, it can almost take down a 200 HP player as Stink Bombs go through health not shield. Giving the player using the stink bombs a massive advantage. Imagine getting spammed by stink bombs. So how to balance it out:

1.Stink Bombs now do 10 per 1/2 second
Stink Bombs maximum damage is 20 damage per 1/2 second, this means if you have 3 or more gas clouds in 1 area that area will still do 20 damage per 1/2 a second. 1 gas cloud in 1 area=10 damage per 1/2 second, 2 gas clouds in 1 area= 20 damage, 3+ gas clouds in 1 area= 20 damage. (To make it balanced)
2.The Stink Bomb’s gas cloud size has been decreased by 15% 
3.Stink Bomb’s delay between throwing each stink bomb has increased by 30% (To avoid spam scattering)

This new form of glider redeploy will be obtainable as an item out of chests, vending machines, supply drops, etc. It will be limited on the number of uses (not sure how many, probably 5-10). Therefore, a broken mechanic will be available to only those fortunate enough to find it. Even planes are pretty much easy enough for people to get if they really want it, but with RNG involved, only the fortunate few will rock with this broken mechanic. 

Enough is enough, if you can’t think of a quality item to add to the game, than don’t add any. I would be more than happy if they removed some of these items that have nothing to do with the core principles of fortnite, and are broken. (Boom Boxes, Dynamite, Balloons, Quad Laucher, etc)

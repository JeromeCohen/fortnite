Most players know for **Refound,** what's really cool and good from Epic Games. But, by other site, you have just 3 **lifetime** tokens. But my suggestion is, that everyplayer will get **1 token** every **season** and max tokens will be like **5** or **10.**

That will be very cool. It's just suggestion, and if you have additional suggestions for that, write them in comments please.

**BUT**, that may sounds OP, so, you don't need to make that, like I said. You can give tokens like, every 3 months, or 4. Or max 3 tokens. Etc.

I would actually like to play both, but as a console player it is extremely difficult. 

The way aiming sensitivity is calculated between games is completely different. If I try and switch back from apex my muscle memory is all wrong and as a result I cannot aim well in Fortnite anymore. That results in me having a bad time and ultimately just going back to Apex.

I think this is something that should be standardized across all console games, especially competitive PvP shooters. At the very least a raw input option should be available in all console games for consistency. This would also allow Xbox players to utilize the custom curves that come with the elite controller software. You would then be able to have identical response curves in every game.",FortNiteBR

Pretty much any extended sound effect is just the same sample on a continuous loop.

Take the glider for one example: The sound of the wind blowing around as you glide down is just the same sample repeated multiple times. On the PC it isn‚Äôt like that at all, and dynamically changes depending on the direction you‚Äôre travelling in. And this is the same for all the other sounds.

What I don‚Äôt get though, is that they‚Äôve gone to the effort of actually *changing* some of these single samples in recent updates to better ones. If they could do that, why they hell can‚Äôt they use the same system as is on PC?

(mostly what I do except in place like fatal fields etc.But I dont feel secure in this case except if its a good ar or a pump.) Plus,I dont know my preference,if I prefer the scar over ak,pump over tac,smg over dual pistols,snipers over meds,or gliders over meds or rpg over compact smg or rpg over grenade launcher.How I would like to fight is to have a gun that doesnt miss to much shots and is consistant and that pulls heavy damage that is guaranted,what I prefer the most is the guns that are for every range and that doesnt miss too much.Plus,I dont know my qualities and defaults on the game...been playing since early s2 on ps4 and I dont know what is my best quality so I can impliment it on my games as much as needed,my defaults I know them but I just have a lot and its really hard to fix at the time.A quality I want to have is to make people lose track of me so I can heal if needed and flank everyone.Basically,being subtle and unknown.What do you guys things?I dont like to practice honestly I did it too many times and its kinda not useful.Oh!Last thing,the sensitivity,I changed my sens so much since season 5 that I dont know what to use,I tried all sens from 3.5 to 9.5,high sens makes me play really good for a short amount of time but when time pass by I kinda suck with it but im getting some lucky headshots with them.Low sens are consistant but I slightly miss obvious shots with them sometimes its annoying.I find 6.00 to 7.50 sens stale and too regular for me tbh.Dont want to use them,for my build sens I want to do consistant circle 90s withour being under the ramps.For ads sens...meh...I want something consistant mid range.Snipers...a good sens for people running.I spent my morning typing this hope ill get amazing help from this community,thank you to read all of these,hope the best for you guys,I would like a kinda short reply or not too complex one pls btw. :) (I may have made typo btw)",FortNiteBR

Yes the most of the top players play PC, yes there is higher FPS, more buttons and the ability to play stretched.

However some people play fortnite on their mom's work laptop. 

I play both console and PC (sometimes with a controller but mostly M&amp;KB. PC has more good players, but the worst of the worst players also play on pc. 

The changes to console have made the playing field almost even. The only thing that still sets PC apart is aim (but only slightly) and editing (much easier on pc).

4: Amazing Battlepass and story
5: Frozen legends and Fallen Love Ranger packs

Free stuff:
1: 14 days of Fortnite items
2: Ice King event items
3: Marshmallow event items
4: pigskin toy
5: Valentine's glider
6: Cuddle team leader wrap
7: Overtime challenges

I personally was, at one time, one of these people. I believe it is time we have a real discussion about this topic. Most posts I view on this subreddit on the topic of the Season 4 challenges are receipted with extreme toxicity. A significant portion of the statements claim that these people do not deserve the unlock able styles for the Carbide and Omega outfits because they were not able to dedicate time to Fortnite. There are many more factors at play other then time spent on the game. Has no one considered that purchasing large amounts of BP tiers allows for quicker access to the experience boosts, which reduced the time required to progress in the challenges. If you paid, you got the Omega Styles faster. We also have to consider the inconvenient timing of Season 4. The first half of Season 4 took place during the month of May, which for most people, is when the school year ends, which means finals. Personally, I had little to time to waste in Fortnite because if this exact reason. There is one last thing I want to bring up, and that is the appearance of the Carbide/Omega outfits on lower levels. The default styles for the 2 outfits are simply a lesser version of the actual outfit. So, if an individual was to pitch the Battle Pass late, they would be left with a subpar outfit.

But I've noticed that whenever I spectate after I've been killed, 9 times out of 10, the player is switching between weapons in a way that shouldn't be possible on a controller; like going from the 2nd to 4th slot or something like that.

I thought the point of separating lobbies between pc and consol was for the primary purpose of letting controller players play against other controller players and keyboard and mouse players playing against other keyboard and mouse players.

I feel like using a keyboard and mouse gives an unfair advantage when playing against players with controllers.
Why would so many people go through the trouble of hooking up a keyboard and mouse to their consol if it wasn't?

Is there anyone here who uses a keyboard and mouse on consol? And if so, why?

And is there anyway I can play against other controller players exclusively, because it's pretty frustrating to be killed by these players when it's obvious they're using a keyboard and mouse.
It seems like most of the lobby is people doing this. Its honestly pretty rare to see a player switching between weapons one by one as you would see if they were using a controller.

Switching between weapons isn't the only advantage of using a keyboard and mouse, it's just the only sign I know of that tells me they aren't using a controller.

Although i do like how the battle pass/seasonal shop mechanic works in the game, i dislike how after the season is over some skins/emotes are locked away forever from those who didn't play that season, so i had an idea that i know is going to get bad feedback but i might as well post it: A randomized shop.
It would work kind of like the normal item shop, but every day (or maybe less, like flash sales), people would get a random skin/emote from ANYWHERE but the season they are in right at that moment, so you could get anything at all, including old battle pass items like ""Best mates"" or ""The visitor"" for a price that is either the normal for the rarity, or a little more expensive. 
A lot of people (me included) want skins/emotes that aren't avaliable anymore, and because of that, having a specific skin usually means you are ""better"" because you have a ""rare"" skin, this shop would slowly break that stigma and even make some people spend more, it's a win/win situation, except for those who i cited above, witch would probably be salty for not having a ""premium skin/emote"".
I don't know if Epic will ever try this, but i'd be happy if they did.

My biggest issue is that the battle pass challenges now feel like ‚Äúwork‚Äù to me and not just challenges I am able to complete with a bit of focus while playing. I already work full time, I don‚Äôt need another job.

My main issue is with the multi-stepped challenges that collectively only reward 5 stars or one tier on the pass for a 3-5 step challenge that I HAVE to complete over that amount of games. I wouldn‚Äôt give a damn if I could just hop in a plane and shoot through all the locations in a single game, but the fact that I‚Äôm FORCED to make that challenge my focus for X amount of games just to get half a tier or one tier is terrible design. Plus the banners instead of stars for the completion of the challenges are also a waste. I can‚Äôt remember ever being excited about picking up a banner.

I used to love this game, the silly shit like planes and stuff didn‚Äôt ruin the game for me and stop me from playing - logging in on reset day and seeing 3 multi stepped challenges or dumb challenges like ‚Äúplay the song on the pianos‚Äù is what ruined the game for me.

So you drop far away from everyone else, but close to where several supply drops are coming down.  And your main goal is to carry the Scar, and shotgun and any heals you can find, Slurps, medkits are the best.  

Next is you try to avoid the enemy the best you can, staying away from some of the more popular areas. But also searching for more supply drops to find meds if you haven't found any yet.   Stay alive to that final circle that generally ends over by Divot. 

Once the circle closes in, start medding up right when the storm hits you.  The other team will have no idea what is happening and just die.

Im a casual player who gets worked by better players all the time, and thats ok. 

Recently this community has gotten to a point where you are ridiculed and shamed for being good at the game. I have NEVER seen a community bash on people for being successful in a game where the goal is to win by beating others. Now if you want to make casual jabs at people for being ‚Äúsweats‚Äù or ‚Äúbots‚Äù, hey all good fun. (I know ive yelled that at my tv a time or two) But acting like good players are ruining the community or that this game isnt fun because you get destroyed is pretty ridiculous.

If you play fortnite to just have fun and mess around like me, awesome. If you play to decimate everyone and win consistently? Great, more power to you. But jesus if you arent as good, dont hate on people who are. This game has a huge skill gap with building and that can make it difficult to be successful, but its also what makes this game unqiue. You either work to get better, or find a way to enjoy it at your skill level.

This sub is a place for the fans and community to share tips, funny moments, and suggest changes to the devs. Not a platform to bash, whine, and ridicule others for having a different reason for playing the game. So lets stop the hate and be an actual community!

Peace, love, fortnite ‚úåüèª ",FortNiteBR

A slightly bigger amount of XP and an extra one on my stats isn't enough in my opinion. They shown that they can give out free stuff if you earn it. Most recently a free battlepass, in the past, cosmetics such as gliders and harvesting tools. 

Why can't we get a small amount of V-Bucks for winning a match and then a few more for high kill games? 

Or perhaps an entirely brand-new currency, that you have to earn a lot of to get skins and other cosmetics?

I enjoy the game now with the whole HP/Shield on kill, plane and Rocket Launcher nerf, it's been so much more enjoyable, but whenever I've won a game, I don't feel as good as I should. I haven't earned anything, just a stat boost and extra XP that amounts to nothing once you've completed the battle pass.

It's hard not to be frustrated when a game you really love changes something that makes it less enjoyable for you, but today I just want to say thank you to Epic for making such an amazing game and experienced regardless of the frustrating moments I've had.

So Earlier Today, A Security Memember Of Fortnite Posted A Tweet Saying The Following, ""All Shotgun Exploiting Will Be Gone With Season 8, All Players Who Did This Previously Will Be Dealt With, We Are Aware Of The Aimbot Exploit And Will Be Making Adjustments To Eliminate It"" The Post Was Taken Down Seconds After Release Leaving Many To Wonder What Changes Will Be Made, Below Are MY SPECULATIONS On What Will Happen, Don‚Äôt Hate Me If It Happens.

Pump Shotgun:

Uncommon Pump Shotgun Vaulted

Rare Pump Shotgun Remains

Epic And Legendary Shotguns Remains

Headshot Damage DECREASED From 150 - 50 (Huge Change)

Aiming Adjustments, (Probally Fixing The Aiming Bot Like Shots)

Range DECREASED From 75 - 50

Reload Speed INCREASED from 50 - 65

I Believe They Will Do This As Shotgun Spawn Is Set To 85% In The Data Mined Files, They Want Shotguns To Become More Rare...Let‚Äôs See‚Ä¶

Tactical Shotgun

Common Tactical Shotgun Vaulted

Uncommon And Rare Versions Will Be The Only Versions

Fire Rate DECREASED From 62 - 55

Reload Speed Slightly Increased From 65 - 75

Tactical Spread Of Shells Widend Slightly

Again Not Sure 100% May Even Be Wrong, But I Am A Student For Game Development So These Are Just My Speculations...Don‚Äôt Be Surprised If It Happens, Players Have Exploited Multiple Times For Their Own Gain And Ruined Battle Royales Player Count By Over 200,000 People Because Of It. Epic Wants To Keep The Game Fair And Balanced Which Is Why I COULD See This Happening. NO NEGATIVE (KYS, FU\*K OFF) Comments, Feedback Accepted. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

The key is to walk away for awhile, before you hit that point. Fortnite is a cosmetics mall housed inside of a casino‚Äîthe slot machines and tables are wins, kills, and build battles. Weekly updates with the infinite flow of skins, abstract story lines that spawn theories, and daily/weekly/special challenges are the free drinks and room upgrades that ensure that you'll come to the casino frequently...until you don't. It's just how it works. Fortnite's style of Battle Royale is inherently low-reward over time, because as skill increases, the value of the reward declines‚Äîkills mean less, high-kill players receive no cosmetic perk, high-win players receive no cosmetic perk, hard-grinding players don't receive cosmetic perks anymore (think Omega colors). So, no meaningful achievement perks, no aesthetic brags (special skins/wraps), there is no end game, there is no finishing of the story, there is no completion reward‚Äîit's the ultimate hamster wheel. If you get tired of it, it shouldn't be a surprise.

The answer here is to walk away for awhile, then come back.

It's that simple.",FortNiteBR

Just remember that a quality of game is not decided on it's player base, or the graphics, or how much money it makes,but the love the developer puts into the game and how they communicate with the audience they have captured. I want to find that connection again in games because at some point during fortnite I lost that love I had for video games in general. 


The past 3 weeks I have not touched fortnite and this morning I finally uninstalled it. I have never felt more clear since starting, my mind is not constantly flooded with the need to improve or finish challenges. A stress comes with fortnite, even if you do not believe it. 

During these three weeks I have rediscovered my love for gaming. I've been playing Trials, and PSVR titles that I haven't touched in over a year. I am finally back into Assassin's Creed and let me tell you this Sparta Assassins! Yes!!! Yes!! Yes!!!!  

Just wanted to share my state of mind and how fortnite made me feel both happy and depressed over video games. 

I am happy again now that I am playing the type of games that used to make me happy. 

Hope I open some eyes to you who have been on that constant grind. Its good to take a break. ",FortNiteBR

Anyone that have my same opinion? ",FortNiteBR

However, the lack of balance that new items have brought has made patches frustrating.

Moving forward, **prioritize changing the map**

One of the most unique elements of the game is how you tell a story through the map, skins, and loading screens.

I would encourage Epic to continue (and even expand) on this story telling format.

Daily/Weekly map changes make the game extremely unique and a good conversation to have during squads.

No more 3 story 1x1 in a second the moment you miss a shot. 

This would seem like a fun idea to play around with and I think people would actually enjoy playing it. This will give the feeling of when you first played Fortnite in Season 2 because everyone builds super slow. 

The only downside to this is that some people enjoy building and the concept of using structures while you fight, hence why I think this should be a LTM instead of an actual change. 

What do you guys think about this?",FortNiteBR

He snips me again up close like a shot gun and a nano second later switches to smg and kills me. Holy fuck is this guy a mega virgin. He builds a fortress in three seconds, so I lost and all but I wasn't convinced he won fairly, so I go to his xbox live account. And notice he has 0 gamerscore. I look at his clips and he builds shit like a tryhard. For some reason he has his ammo, materials and item slots really tiny on the screen. (probably using an expensive ass gaming monitor). So he nails every shot perfectly and realize he's aimbotting. I report him and leave it that.

Every season we got a brand new concept 

Season 1- (depending on how you see it) item shop/battle pass skins

Season 2- an official battle-pass
Season 3- back bling
Season 4- sprays and edit styles
Season 5- Toys
Season 6- Pets
Season 7- Wraps
Season 8- ???

Now most people would say, ‚Äútraversal emotes‚Äù. But honestly, does it feel like that was really their new concept? They had plenty of options. Something I saw earlier, death effects, hats, animated banners, 3 refund tickets in the bp, even something nearly as simple as traversal, interact able emotes. The bp is still awesome don‚Äôt get me wrong, but they had so many ideas, and I‚Äôm posting this hoping for change in season 9. Also lastly, Luxe is a good looking skin, I completely regret what I said about her, but a cool tier 100 would be a fully customizable skin based on the characters you have. So like I can put Jonesy in overtakers costume, or put maverick in ragnoroks costume. Also they would be color. Change able. This wouldn‚Äôt even be that hard as epic could make ways around it.

I even tried with 120fps but the frames drop down to 50-60 fps often.

im thinking on getting an i7 3770 for a 100$ because I wont have to change the motherboard/ram.

Then there are the ones that, as soon as you approach them, start building so fast you can't even react and you try to build and BAM! Oh, you tought i was there, nah, just went the other way, edited and one-pumped you in the head.

The game really needs some kind of competitive mode, but then again, that is non-ltm modes rn, and they've gotten into ltms too.

Or to nerf rocket launchers, but then again, that only puts the ones that can only get kills with them in the same spot as us, some games it's hard to even get 1, so i kinda get why they go the easy way.

Maybe make some kind of mode, like the normal ones, that sorts you like competitive but in reverse? Like if you have less than X wins, maybe less than 1 solo win, you get into it and once you get one you can't go back? 

Why can't people just let others enjoy the game and kinda go easy on people that can't play 24-7?

There are still skink bombs, rpgs, grenade launcher, clingers, dynamite, and boogie bombs. In my opinion this need to be vaulted. Also so does the minigun. They need to bring back the grenades, as they are pretty much the only fair explosive in the game, as if you can't Dodge them, that's your fault. Also, this god damn lag. Holy shit dude. Hamster balls are fun, but not fair. They need to be vaulted from the comp. playlist.  Also, I think that everyone should start off at least 100 wood and a grey tac. I don't care who you talk to, yes double pump was op in season 2 when nobody built, however, that's not the case anymore. If you hit an oppenet with something they are jat going to build a wall between the two of tigyj away if there an average player.

‚óèThere was a healthy mix of bad players, decent players, and really good players. 
‚óèThe game was very stable and performed very well.
‚óèThe storyline portrayed through loading screens was actually interesting and not as random as the loading screens from season 5 and beyond.
‚óèThe hop rocks were amazing. It gets annoying to have your game filled with gyrospheres, planes, hoverboards, and cannons, however hop rocks created just enough mobility that they weren't op.
‚óèA ton of people were playing early season 4. Not to say a ton arent playing now, but the amount of attention the meteor gained was crazy, nearly all of my friends played early season 4 constantly. 
‚óèAnd finally, the sheer jump from basic gameplay to complex and interesting. Hop rocks, shopping carts, the Visitors escape pod, the building of the rocket, it all made a huge difference in the game. Lately the game has reverted in quality, we all see those clips of invisible players, micro stutters, not to mention the game is literally darker compared to season 4. I dont know the exact post, but someone compared sesson 4 and season 8, and it looks like day and night.

All I'm trying to say is that Fortnite has morphed into a dark, stuttery, chaotic game, when it had truly hit its peak in (my opinion) season 4. I know epic can't just up and out remove everything in the game that players hate, but some basic fixes and removing the chaotic factor of the game would be much appreciated.",FortNiteBR

The code was the same every time!!

I don‚Äôt care anymore. But at least read this. At least discuss with me through dms. From the mere....48 hours that I‚Äôve been on this subreddit. It. Is. Awful. Blocking art that‚Äôs not nsfw because it‚Äôs ‚Äúnsfw‚Äù to an apparent immature community that can make the Peely skin into an innuendo. Blocking art with satirical titles that address a MAJOR problem. This is an oppressive subreddit run by bullied mods. I honestly have a sneaking suspicion that the mods just take down things that people just complain about enough, no matter the logic. They just find something. A bunch of trolls hop onto ship art, claim its sexual, and it takes the art down. The trolls win and they practically filter what can be on this subreddit. People shit on me with every post because it‚Äôs funny or because they‚Äôre just ass holes, or maybe just because I say things that piss them off. This behavior that I have seen in my comments section can and WILL kill people. If I was mentally unstable, I would‚Äôve killed myself already. No doubt. If you love your community, if you appreciate the artwork, (what I believe is arguably one of the best ways to keep a community alive) then take down those people who tear artists and other content creators down. Don‚Äôt take out your artists. That will kill the community faster than you can imagine. You take down my shit because you‚Äôre bullied into it by the toxic heathens you let stay on here. These people will kick more and more people off. All of the artists will be scared away from continuing to use, or ever using the platform. And magically your cute little subreddit will be filled with shit content that the heathens create. After all, the real content creators would‚Äôve all left. Art is important in a community. Without it, I wouldn‚Äôt know half the games that exist out there. It keeps content fresh, even when there hasn‚Äôt been much activity in the game, and makes things fun, especially when people put their own twists/headcanons/ideas into it. Fortnite can only be fresh for so long on its own. People WILL get sick of seeing the same gameplay. 

I considered reddit as an internet hugbox. But as far as this subreddit goes, it‚Äôs a hugbox for toxic children. ",FortNiteBR

I would unvault the double barrel shotgun. When I try it out I feel like it is pretty balanced. It has a high reload time and only two shots, so it's not like it would be overpowered.

It's...not good.  The past 6 or so weeks have confirmed what I saw with my friends.  People seem to be dropping this game.

If you check how Fortnite is doing on Twitch, you'll see the same result.  

So is this the beginning of the end for Fortnite or do you think Epic can fix what's broken and get Fortnite healthy again?",FortNiteBR

Not to mention the fact that this season is the most boring and sweatiest season yet (weekly challenges are also ass) Eventually this game is going to go downhill, more casual players are going to leave, which leaves more tryhards.

Now more tryhards mean less of a chance of people actually learning to play the game and they struggle because of people just one tapping them without a chance.

This gamemode would base on the regular squad mode but with some changes at the reviving system.

Whenever your team knocks an enemy, you would be able to revive him and the knocked enemy would play at your side after the revive.

This gives 2 options when you knock an enemy:

	\-finish him from safe disance

	\-take the risk and revive him

The last team standing wins the game.

Been landing there since season 4 and I'm extremely happy that it's (mostly) never been tampered with or replaced by a new POI. However, the addition of corn a few months back has just made it so much worse. I'm really not sure how it's not discussed more in this subreddit but it's just awful. I can't tell you how many times I've weakened an opponent significantly, just to have to chase them into the corn and get one-pumped by a player I can't even see. I'm at the point where I just walk away from fights if my opponent goes into the corn, and lately I don't even bother shooting at a player if they're remotely near the corn. Additionally, the ability to be completely hidden on the edge of the corn but still be able to see clearly outside of it while ADSing is absolutely absurd. It's broken beyond belief. I feel like the only reason this doesn't get a lot of attention is because most top streamers don't land at Fatal Fields, but for an average player like me, it's a nightmare and I know I can't be alone in this. A lot of locations in Fortnite get small updates or little things tweaked as time goes by, and I feel like Fatal Fields having a harvest would be a very good and necessary thing at this point.

(general discussion)","I have been playing regularly, sometimes 8+ hours in day if I feel like it, since season 6 started when I got my switch. I have improved gradually over time, and am able to get wins on a somewhat regular basis now. I had a great time in season 7, and scored about 85 wins. I only got 15 in season 6. Now in season 8 so far I have around 20, so I'm still getting them at about the same rate. The thing is, everyone else seems to have gotten a LOT better, and it seemed to happen almost over night, near the end of season 7. I'm not sure what happened, maybe I got placed into a higher tier of secret skill based matchmaking I theorize is in the game, but man, these lobbies have gotten so sweaty. There is a guy with 10, 15, even 20 kills in every lobby now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that with switch and mobile merging the lobbies would get easier. This has decidedly NOT been the case. I used to average 4-8 kills per game, and now I'm lucky to get 2 or 3. The final circles have become sweat fests like none other. It seems to me like mobile players really have an edge on switch players because they get higher fps and have stronger aim assist and even auto fire. I think its only fair that switch have auto fire and a tweak to aim assist as well. Aim assist has been proven to be linked to fps, so if these mobile players have higher fps they inherently have better aim assist, and boy does it show in these lobbies. People will laser you from a mile away. I have to actually aim and fire manually on switch, so even though I have a controller, it just seems a bit unfair to me. Mobile players with a sniper simply have to aim in your general direction and the shot will be taken for them and its game over. That also seems unfair to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really not sure what it is, but I think its a combination of the merging of servers and the fact that the switch is somewhat underpowered for fortnite, but switch lobbies have become nightmarishly difficult at times. Theoretically I should be getting better and better to the point that I can get ten kill games, but it seems like the difficulty just keeps going up. Its astounding really, and somewhat confusing, and at times, very frustrating. All I want is for the game to be as fair as possible for a BR, and it seems like mobile players really have an edge on switch players. I would prefer that switch players just be in their own lobbies, even if it means I have to wait a little bit longer to get into a game. It just seems like mobile and switch are too different and run on different mechanics. It isn't a snug fit like xbox and ps4 lobbies are. I get that they are trying to make things work in the ways they know how, but I feel like this was a mis-step. Trying to gun a guy down who has a 2000 dollar ipad running at 60 fps on max settings while I'm lucky to get 20fps on the switch just seems wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

I also wanted to mention the scarcity of blue ars. Seriously you have to be LUCKY to find a blue ar. I can find a scar easier than a blue ar now, and that is just bonkers. The rarities are all jacked up for ars now. The ak is borderline unusable. The infantry rifle was decidedly a failure. All we have left are the scar and the suppressed. Nobody wants to play half the game with a green or grey ar, but that is the way its playing out now, unless you find a treasure map or get lucky with a vending machine. Since the rarity update I have gotten scars from chests a total of about ten times. Yet I get a treasure map every three games or so. Its just silly. Give us back blue ars! I miss them! Surely I'm not the only one.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you could epic, please raise the spawn rate on balloons and rpgs, just a little, so I can win a bunch again. I ground out 7 wins today and they were HARD wins to get. I just can't keep up with these mobile gurus. They got magic aim and autoshoot when all I have is my wits and a green ar. Help me epic!

As of now, the only synergy that exists is a pump shotgun and silenced smg/assault rifle. There is literally no other combo of weapons that can be consistently used.

**Proposed change:**

**Give lesser used weapons some type of special feature.**

**Example:**

1. **The Infantry rifle could ALWAYS have first shot accuracy**
2. **The pistol can do 3 times head shot damage with a .5 second reload**
3. **The purple/gold rarities of SMG can do double damage to buildings with a ramping fire rate.**
4. **The tatical shotgun could get a range boost (call it high powered shells or something) so that it covers more mid range play and a draw speed like the other shotguns**

The heavy sniper already has a feature like this (being able to one shot a structure or tree) and has been an amazing addition to the game. It is time to add a little ""pizzazz"" to and love to a few items so we get more viable options to play with.

&amp;#x200B;

For every kill you get, the gun you used to kill them will degrade by 1. When you kill someone they will drop everything but their guns. You are unable to drop your guns.

The degradation will work like this:

50/50 chance Gold Scar/ Suppressed Scar &gt; 50/50 chance Purple Scar/ Suppressed Scar &gt; 50/50 chance Blue AR/ Heavy AR &gt; 50/50 chance Green AR / Heavy AR &gt; 50/50 chance Grey Ar/ Heavy AR. After reaching grey it will switch every kill between AR and Heavy AR.

Purple and Gold Heavy Shotgun will be temporarily unvaulted and progression will act just like the AR with 50/50 chances upon kill.

Compact SMGs are the only Purple and Gold, and Blue/ Green/ Grey SMGs will be 50/50 chance between Suppressed SMG and Tactical SMG.

Airdrops will reset one weapon back to Gold at random.

Llamas will reset one weapon back to Purple at Random.

Vending Machines will give you the option to reset any One of your weapons to the rarity of the vending machine. Only Gold, Purple, and Blue Vending Machines are available.

The issue with sbmm or ranked is queue times. I get that. And smurfs. I get that too. Completely valid arguements against sbmm or ranked but has anyone discussed matching players of average ACCURACY together? Forget k/d ratio or win rate. Some players get carried skewing win rate. But if players with 30% accuracy have a chance to play against players in a 25-35% accuracy range it would be a more fair fight.

And I have gotta say this is just getting really old... I find it hard to enjoy the game anymore, the amount of no-lifers, playground warriors, sweats or whatever you want to call them is just getting insane. Even when simply running Team Rumble to knock out my weekly challenges or dailies you more often than not run into people floor/wall/ramp rushing, using cones to block advances and using other advanced techniques they mastered after spending every waking moment outside of school in playground for weeks on end is just crazy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given that most people consider LTMs to be a casual play-space I really feel sorry for new players as they won't/don't stand a chance and will never be able to play without spending a week or two in playground/creative just to master the basics, then to still get stomped by no-lifers every match. 

&amp;#x200B;

When skill-based matchmaking was first proposed I was one of the people that said not to do it. The issue is Epic launched creative/playground where people with nothing else to do in their lives can spend hours perfecting building techniques that let them box you in, without being in the same tile? Are you kidding me? I played 4 Team Rumble matches tonight, every single one I felt I was fighting people that belong in high competitive matches. This game is quickly requiring the effort that a $30 an hour job takes and again - IT IS A GAME. 

&amp;#x200B;

You can taut that SBMM is a bad idea, that having a ranked mode is the best solution, but when people like this are going into LTMs it just shows a Ranked Mode would do nothing. SBMM is the only way to give new players a chance and to restore the sense of the game being just that - a game. After your first 25 matches, win or 100 kills (whichever comes first) you need to be matched with people your same skill level from there on out. Just use the pin method in all gameplay.

I tested this on my main account, since I was sure if skill based matchmaking were a thing, my account has already had enough games played to be affected by it. What I did was I played 3 matches as normal, trying to get kills and win, then recorded as much of the lobbies season 8 k/d as I could in solo matches, then calculated an average which would give an idea of the overall skill level of the lobby. 

After taking the stats from the 3 games I then went on to deliberately lose 20 games without killing anyone or placing high, with the intent to lower my skill rating enough so I could notice a difference in the lobbies skill level when I next tested, I did not eliminate myself 20 times rather I let 20 players kill me because again didn't want to risk self elimination being considered a void outcome by the matchmaking system. 

Then the final part was to play another 3 games after the 20 consecutive 0 kill bad placing losses, and take each of the lobbies season 8 solo k/d and see if this set of games would be noticeably different from the first set. So here's what I found: 

In the first 3 games the average lobbies k/d's were 1.09, 0.78 and 1.16 with a combined average of 1.01. 

In the second set of games after the 20 0 kill bad placing games the average k/d's in each lobby were 0.68, 0.63 and 0.92 with an overall average of 0.74, so interestingly, the average players k/d was down by -0.27 after the 20 games of performing as badly as possible, and that's from taking exactly 242 players stats from the first set of 3 games and 230 from the second set after the 20 losses. The frequency of +1 k/d players also dropped noticeably in the second set of matches, with 43% of players in the first set of games having a season 8 solo k/d of over one, in the second set the percentage of players with a season 8 solo k/d of 1 or above was down to 23%. 

I don't think there is any way to be absolutely certain of the existence of skill based matchmaking but from looking at this it really does seem as if there is some kind of matchmaking based on performance in the game right now.

SO I began counting the number of male skins I saw in the pregame lobby in regular pubs. I would run around the entire spawn island, and most times find 3-6 male skins, the rest being no skins, female soccer skins, female skins with wings, people you can tell are sweaty by the skin they are wearing. I was on my dry streak still and thought, oh, ill just go play gauntlet because I have not played and I will have 0 points, so I will be playing players that aren't sweating or just arent very good. I go into the lobby and notice a huge change. I went around the entire spawn island again and noticed something, I only saw 3-6 FEMALE skins. Before, it was all female skins, now, in lobby's that clearly arent as sweaty, its all male skins. Crazy right? I know this may sound ridiculous, but what if, what if Epic were to separate lobby's by skins, just what if. They obviously wouldn't say anything, but to do it subtly, it could make the game much more enjoyable. They wouldn't even notice the difference. I feel that this would actually work. When was the last time you died to a kid that was sweating  that wasn't a female skin? Not complaining, once again.",FortNiteBR

This isn‚Äôt your average ‚Äúadd back double pump‚Äù post.

Have you ever played some game back when you were a kid, and loved it and enjoyed it? For example, Pok√©mon games, n64 games, etc? You would play it all day for hours on end and make many memories with your friends. Then, when you got older, you lose the game and can‚Äôt find it. You‚Äôre devastated and would do anything to get it back. You keep thinking of solutions to get it back, but they‚Äôre all unreasonable. You get desperate once you start losing hope.

It‚Äôs the same way with double shotgunning. It was the most fun mechanic in the game and rewarded skill, something that most of the playerbase loved. It was a skill to learn, and once you learned how to use it, you were rewarded. It was powerful, but only in the right hands. One of the most satisfying to pump them for 90, switch to the other pump, and shoot that back to back. It felt like a beat to a song.

And it was removed. This obviously devastated those who used it and loved it. It promoted another playstyle that was introduced forcefully, pump-smg. It wasn‚Äôt organic, it wasn‚Äôt something the community made up. It was forced, and hard. It was annoying to face against, and annoying to use when bloom screwed you over. All of your practice with double shotgunning and learning how to use it-gone.

And now you‚Äôre stuck with using an annoying playstyle. Don‚Äôt use it, and you‚Äôre screwed. At least double shotgunning had a counter, which was building. Good luck building against those smgs.

Now, not only do you want double shotgunning back, but the hate for SMGs makes you want it back even more. You want some other variety in the game.

Now it‚Äôs season 8. The main game has changed drastically, but one thing has remained the same. Pump-smg has been the meta for almost 5 seasons. Sure, some came and went, but pump-smg has reigned over those. And to those who used double shotgunning, a hole is left in their heart. At least in mine. I‚Äôve never thought the game never needed change ever since they removed it. I‚Äôm never satisfied, nothing can fill that infinite hole of not having it. The game just isn‚Äôt as fun.

It really wouldn‚Äôt hurt to add in creative. Adding it back in the main game modes is a controversial topic(I would love it to IMO)however, since people pretty much have PTSD of facing it because people weren‚Äôt as good back then, so they were easily destroyed. Now people are better and won‚Äôt die to it, as people build now. But that‚Äôs off topic.

Epic please, it really wouldn‚Äôt hurt to add to creative, and would fill my(and most likely a lot of others)heart, and I would enjoy the game.

Thank you and that concludes my TED Talk.",FortNiteBR

Ever since they started to make every new LTM squads because they want you to play with friends, which I use to, but fortnite also just got stale for them also for the same reason, so now basically none of my friends play it and I'm also starting to not play it. I use to always play because of the variety of play styles, like you could carry 2 shotguns, you could use rpgs, you could mostly build, but now its mostly just spray and pray or rpg spam. I don't care if this gets downvoted to hell or removed, I just want to let everybody know that I'm tired of the path the game's gone to. So many glitches, every respawnable LTM I see like 3 people stuck in midair with me while we lose because we're all stuck in midair and can't leave if we're doing challenges.",FortNiteBR

We already have counters for this, such as stink bombs, dynamite, and boomboxes, but the hand cannon is multipurpose, so it shouldn’t be vaulted. One major difference between these other items and the hand cannon is the very loud noises. The double barreled was a counter for turtling too, and  it had both a very audible, iconic, swapping sound, and a long, audible, reload sound. The only changes to the hand cannon that I think should be made is a longer, louder reload speed, and louder swapping audio.

Most of us agree that the pistol is not the most viable weapon in any situation. If it’s the only weapon you have you’ll stand no chance close range against any half-decent player with an SMG and/or shotgun, and no chance mid range against them if they have an AR. The damage should be buffed to 25/26/27/28, meaning you’d be able to kill a player early game with 4 body shots or 2 headshots (which is already doable with a suppressed pistol) rather than 5 body shots and 3 headshots. The pistol would still be at the bottom at the food chain, but you’ll have some chance of winning a fight if it’s the only thing you’ve got.",FortNiteBR

No Battle Pass is the same. Here is a breakdown of all the battle passes we have had, and how I think they could be improved, for a Free to Players and Payers.

Season 1:

Unlock Rewards based off of your Season level, Tiers didn’t exist yet

Rewards unlock every 5 Tiers, 2 Free rewards, and 4 paid rewards

Season 2:

Actual Battle Pass system implemented, with 70 tiers

All paid rewards are just locked behind 950 V-bucks

Bonus Daily Challenge every day

Backblings Introduced

Season 3:

First Battle Pass with 100 Tiers

Still 950 V-bucks  

Tier 100 Challenges Introduced

Weekly Challenges come out every week rather than a bonus Daily Challenges

Contrails Introduced

Season 4: 

Unlockable Styles introduced, only unlocked with XP you got during that season, and colors were the final unlock

Now 7 skins in the Battle Pass

Weekly Challenges now got you a Loading Screen for completing them

Hidden in the Loading Screen were now clues on where to find a Battle Pass Star, which gave you a free tier

Completing 7 full weeks of challenges unlocked an extra skin and backbling

First live event was in this season (Rocket Launch)

Season 5:

Unlockable Style system changed, now Styles could be unlocked outside the season

Tier 100 now had an Unlockable Backbling and Pickaxe 

You weren’t able to unlock colors in this season

There were now 10 Weekly Loading screens, but #8 and #9 had banners, and #10 didn’t have anything and was unlocked through completing every challenge and collecting every star and banner

Toys Introduced

This season had a kind of continuous live event, once Kevin the Cube came onto the map, every 2 hours he would move

Season 6:

Unlockable Styles changed yet again, colors were reintroduced but now you had to complete Weekly Challenges for them

Tier 100 no longer had an Unlockable pickaxe, only a backbling

Stars and banners now alternated Loading Screens, and the #10 Loading Screen was just like the rest

Lobby Music and Pets were introduced

Second real live event was in this season (Butterfly effect)

Season 7:

Unlockable Styles changed yet again, with just more customization options and more Unlockable pickaxes, backblings, emotes, and banners!

The two Tier 1 skins both got Unlockable Styles

In this Battle Pass there were now a total of 4 Customizable Skins

7 Week Challenges for the Secret Skin were changed, and now you could complete any 60 challenges from any 10 weeks

Loading Screens were now kept separate from the 7 Weeks skin, and completing all weeks got you a banner

Wraps Introduced

How I Would Want The Battle Pass To Change:

Layout:

Less Sprays and Emoticons (and I guess XP)

Every skin should have 1 or 2 Unlockable Styles at least, it would encourage playing more

Unlockable Styles:

You should be able to start working towards challenges for skins you haven’t gotten yet 

Colors should always be locked behind Weekly Challenges 

There should be one color and/or style locked behind a challenge that had to be completed in that season, just to reward grinders 

Weekly Challenges:

Can we have more Battle Star locations? They are a free easy tier and are fun to figure out (even though you could just look it up)

Less visit ___ and ___ in a single match

I know people hate the banners so here is a simple improvement: Make it so the banners also grant you a free tier, but you still get the banner

You should be able to get a Loading Screen for completing 7 challenges from any weeks, so if you don’t want to grind out certain challenges you won’t have to (I have seen people who have completed every challenge except for one in all the weeks, they should deserve Loading Screens)

7 Week Skin:

It would be nice to be able to get the skins full set, not just 2 or 3 parts

You should unlock different parts on different week, for example:

3 Weeks: A Contrail

4 Weeks: A Glider

5 Weeks: A Pickaxe

6 Weeks: A Backbling

7 Weeks: A Skin

8 Weeks: A Banner

(Keep In Mind These Are All In One Set)

Free Pass:

More rewards for Free Pass people who get to a high tier (I mean come o the final reward is a Spray)

I did the calculation and someone who is completely Free-To-Play can get up to Tier 94 (not including the 35 tier glitch). So maybe Epic should reward people who get to Tier 90 (maybe with a skin, although I doubt it) because they have grinder and played their game so much.

Free Passers should also be able to get Loading Screens, with the same rule I said before (complete 7 Weekly Challenges from any week). Obviously they are limited to how many they can get (3x10=30/7=4r2).

____

I would like to know what other people think of this. I might update it and or course fix the countless typos that are probably in it. If I am wrong about anything just please tell me politely. This took a few hours to research and write. I hope Epic sees this and implements some of it! ",FortNiteBR

If I saw a skin that I liked and would wear more than once then I'd purchase it. Several of my friends have asked, ""how much money have I spent on Fortnite?"" My response would always be something along the lines of  ""too much money"". Believe it or not, I've never been interested in totaling up my entire inventory until today. I was about to get off Fortnite for the night and was looking through my skins. I had actually forgotten how many skins I had and haven't worn in a while. I decided to screenshot my entire inventory, double check the prices of each skin and estimate the amount spent. I didn't include battle passes but it could easily be added since I don't buy tiers or the extended battle pass. I organized my inventory into a picture with the marked values below. I didn't price the galaxy or Nvidia skin. I marked $30.00 for the Xbox exclusive skin because I bought the code online.

&amp;#x200B;

With that said, I'm not trying to collect all the Fortnite skins nor do I see myself as a skin collector. Normally I tend to purchase character skins rather than gliders or pickaxes. Even though I've bought several of both, I always end up using an umbrella and a pickaxe that has low audio.

&amp;#x200B;

How many skins do you guys have and how much money have you spent on Fortnite?

1. Epic tweeted about the ouroboros skins and said the cycle begins. Ouroboros is a symbol of snake eating it’s own tail. 

2. I was thinking it would be some kind of mytology. Norse mytology seems the most possible. There is a snake in there that bites it’s own tail. 

3. We have the Ragnarok and valkyrie skins hinting at the snow map we have now. 

4. Ragnarok in Norse mytology is a series of events causing the gods fall and Rise. A new earth also comes. 

5. Before Ragnarok, the winter comes. 
There will be a giant flood in Ragnarok i think. The iceburg could cause a giant flood when they melt. 

6. We have the eggs in the dungeon. 
I think the eggs hint at the snake coming. 

7. In Ragnarok, there is a battle between the gods and the giants. It takes place on a giant field. 

8. Fortnite is a Battle Royale game. It is like the battle in Ragnarok. 

9. Everything is getting destroyed in Ragnarok but a new and better earth rises from the sea. 

10. The cycle thing, i think is talking about a season cycle. It is an eight season cycle. In season eight i think we will get e completly new map with nothing we have seen before. 

11. The snowfall skin will probably have something to do with the dragon eggs. 
I think they will hatch in week seven. 

12. We have the viking ship on the mountain. I think that ship is the death ship from Norse mytology. 

If you think something else or have something more that could have something to do with this theory , please reply. ",FortNiteBR

Season 1 lasted from October 25,2017 to December 13,2017. This extended a little longer due to the clock glitch at the end of the season.

Renegade Raider is the most common skin from season 1. It is quite simple compared to the current rare skins. 

Renegade Raiders design is from Raider Headhunter a raider subclass in the other mode. The backpack for her was released in season 3 for free in the item shop.

She is a Headhunter model that has lines across her face, a leather hat, and a red cloths with buttons. 

When facing one understand that they have been playing for a longer time and will have more experience at the game. This does not make them untouchable.

So simple solution, stop adding dumb items that no one wants in the game except you (the developers) and prioritize server latency and not cosmetics (east server ping was terrible earlier today and meanwhile you dropped the hideous Paradox and Lace skins without even addressing on your Twitter that you’re working on fixing the terrible ping). Get your priorities straight and stop keeping items in the game that are disliked by the entire player base.",FortNiteBR

This means that all ARs spawn as grey ARs (no SCARs, AKs, FAMASes), all SMGs are grey, all shotguns are grey tacs, all pistols are grey pistols, explosive weapons exist only as blue GLs. 

Each time you get a kill with a certain gun, as the name of the LTM suggest, you get a 1 tier upgrade of that gun. You can choose which option for the gun you want after you get a kill, meaning that if you have a green AR you can choose wheter it will become a blue AR or a blue AK. But once you upgrade it to one or the other that path is locked and you have to stay with your choice, while of course being able to upgrade it further after each kill.

Every gun left after someone dies becomes 2 tiers lower (to somewhat stop people from third partying and taking 2 for 1 upgrades).

After every kill you also get 50 HP/shield.

For me personally, I’m not a streamer that makes money off of playing the game 5-7 hours a day, and I had to work my ass off to get the upgrades, as many other maxed Omega’s did. It’s kind of a kick in the face to say “well I was level 79, and I should get the lights for being so close! Bring them back Epic!” when it was stressful as fuck to get to level 80 in the first place. I had to friend tons of people just so I could grind with a full squad for the extra xp at all times, and even then it was the worst shit I had ever endured. I have a life, a job, productive things to do, and passions and dreams as well. I spent time I didn’t personally have the right to spend on this game, and so did others. It’s selfish to say they didn’t work harder than you, because they obviously did.

At the end of the day, it’s a game, and if you didn’t get the lights who gives a shit? It’s a reward for people who worked harder than you, whether that may be a 100 xp difference or not, they worked for it. ",FortNiteBR

That's not my problem. These aren't challenges. These are tasks. The difference is 1 is skillful to complete (something like get a collective 10 kills in squads or 5 I solos would be nice) and 1 is mind-numbingly boring (land in *blank*, search chests at *blank*, kill enemies at *blank*

When they were were first released everyone could agree that they were over powered.

There’s just vary little risk to using them. 

Planes are a GREAT mobility item and should stay in the game but I believe that in order to make majority of the community happy and truly balance them would be to 

1. Remove the turret 
2. Take away the boost from the plane (for ramming structures) 
3. Decrease the health of the plane overall because in solos it is pretty hard to stop mid fight to shoot a full health plane out of the air. 

The main complaints have been from planes 3rd partying and constantly ramming into structures and firing turrets from above. Removing the ability to cause damage to another player would make the planes a SUPER helpful and balanced item in the game. ",FortNiteBR

I love the war feeling of 50s I don't care if it's one sided. Who the hell dances in Disco? No one plays objective anyways. What difference does it make when Team Rumble is like 80 to 50? Food Fight is worse than dried dog shit.

It would allow for a fresh take on the LMG for players who didn’t care for the vaulted one, players who liked the LMG have a new weapon to use, &amp; lastly we can finally get rid of the overwhelming amount of miniguns in chests lol.

Make boomboxes unable to break metal structures
Slightly reduce dual pistols damage but reduce the bloom
Increase reload time for normal smg
Increase drop rates of shields
Slightly reduce range of grapplers but increase magazine size to 15

Increase reload time for suppressed sniper

Like I think there’s a reason at competitive tournaments only like 2-5 controller players compete when the other like 195 is all PC 

PC you use a mouse and use your whole arm. Controller is a mess without aim assist. It’s your thumb...

But like I’m saying aim assist isn’t so bad. Game runs so much smoother on pc and you can build way better imo and more efficiently on pc. 

But like I said I think there only being like ever 2-5 controller players qualifying for big tourneys and the other 195 players are all PC speaks for itself imo 

If controller was so dominant more controller players would qualify for big skirmishes and what not ",FortNiteBR

I feel like we should bring back the Carbide and Omega challenges. We could earn them back with XP, maybe instead of leveling up to great heights of 80, we could earn as much as 300k - 500k, like for present and previous seasons. If not gaining XP, we could purchase the remaining styles with V-Bucks, I would say, since both skins are legendary 250-500 V-Bucks a Style. Adding all 5 tiers available, the price can go like 1250-2500 V-Bucks. So if someone had 1 or 2 Styles left until max, but Season 5 had started. They could grind or purchase these remaining styles. I'm sure it would make a lot of people appreciate, they can max out one of the coolest Tier 1 or Tier 100 Skins.

[250-500 V-Bucks could be a good price for a Style, for example this final tier that unlocks the remaining Light Colors.](https://i.redd.it/ti4mmx6bn0a21.png)",FortNiteBR

Yes there are toxic players, but in general, I have met many great ppl, children and adults alike.

 Ive been an avid gamer longer than 90% of players have been alive, yes, I'm in my late 40's.  I'm also a military veteran and 20 year police officer.  Talk about breaking down stereotypes.  I've used the game in conversation with children in my community to break the ice, and I've even friended some and played with them.  How did this crazy journey begin?   My daughter drew me into Fortnite back in season 3, and we as a family have never looked back.  We play together all the time.   
 
To the point...   Last season ""6"" my wife who would game occasionally, but is old school and likes old games like Sam and max, or day of the tentacle, etc...  Well, she wanted to get involved and try out Fortnite, because she saw how much fun my daughter and I had playing with friends.  My wife is in late 40s also and has never played a ""shooter"" in her life.  So the learning curve has been HUGE, especially with hand/eye coordination, building etc. ..  She grew very disgruntled dying ALL THE TIME, no kills, just hiding in solo the whole match.  But, she continued playing, and slowly getting better with our encouragement.  

What has made a WORLD of difference has been the game modes which allow her to respawn!  She absolutely loves ""Team RUMBLE"" and ""Disco ""Domination"".    If she gets one or two kills, shes ecstatic!   But, more importantly, she doesn't feel like a burden to her team, or squads, because  the individual performance doesnt weigh so heavily and makes the game so much more enjoyable for her.  We are afraid if these ""respawn"" modes dont stay in regular rotation, she will lose interest and no longer want to play.  The holiday season been great, because these LTM events have been rotating frequently, and allowed us to game happily as a family.  We hope my wife can continue to play well into 2019 with these similar game modes.

Sorry for the long rant, but if anyone at EPIC is listening, thank you in advance for your consideration in this request.",FortNiteBR

Decided to try and get community feedback by having a fun little exercise. 

Title says it all, what are your picks?

Personally, I’d love to see the hand cannon, balloons and mini gun or quad launcher vaulted. I think they’re all either crappy weapons or are used in ways not intended for their purposes, I.e people spamming a hand cannon to destroy your structures, people ballooning and spamming splodes, the fact that people just use balloons to silently get kills, it’s pretty cheap. 

If I could unvault items, the first thing I’m bringing back is the double barrel. I feel as if we need a counter to pumps considering how useless tacticals and heavy shotguns are. I think the DB could be a nice counter and make close range fights a little more challenging rather than just hitting two body shots and walking away. 

The next would probably be the suppressed smg, epic keeps adding suppressed weapons, why not bring back one of the OGs? The more variety we have with ‘secondary’ weapons, the more interesting the battles. Let people actually wrestle with the decision between picking up a normal or a suppressed smg...it would also be great for the memes. 

Lastly, I’d honestly bring back the smoke grenades. I feel like they would be perfect for situations in tilted towers and allow more diverse gameplay rather than spamming and turtling. Combine smoke grenades with thermal ARs and suddenly, the thermal AR becomes more sought after. This season seems to focus on ways to get away so might as well add one of the OG weapons to lower the stress level on certain situations. 

Would be nice to see some guns unvaulted, I would like to think that’s what epic was going for with the whole unvaulted ltm. Hopefully, more diversity keeps coming to the game ",FortNiteBR

My point is, with ranked matchmaking, your not gonna meet that little kid that you make happy with a win nor are you gonna meet a nice dude that plays through with you and gets you the W, you won’t enjoy the times you watch defaults from a far or killing a TTV and emoting him, the game will lose one of the biggest parts, which is diversity.

#This weeks topic is: **Damage Traps**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on Damage Traps to base your conversation on, potential talking points are:

* Are damage traps in a good place in terms of damage output, does the 150 damage need altering?
* Is the drop rate of damage traps sufficient, should they be more/less common?
* Should there be a variety of traps, for mainly damage, that do different damage outputs?
* Should the delay on the trap activation and reload speed be adjusted in any way?
* How much do traps influence build battles and how does it affect tactical gameplay?

So I went into a solo match, did that, but it didn't count, then I assumed that by ""different weapons"" they probably mean different types of weapons, so I went into a solo match. And I had, an assault rifle, a shotgun, a submachine gun, a pistol, and a sniper rifle. All completely different types of weapons. I dealt damage with every single one of them. I won, pressed ""return to lobby"". And nothing, it just didn't work. Then I assumed instead of dealing damage, it means get eliminations with different types of weapons in a single match.  I went into a solo match, had the same loadout as before, and I got a kill, with each type of weapon in my inventory, AR, shotgun, SMG, pistol and sniper rifle. It was pretty hard, but at least I completed the challenge right? Nope, I returned to the lobby screen and nothing, it just didn't count.

I just love playing the game a lot, and watching popular streamers like Tfue and Daequan pull off 20 kill games like it's nothing. I love the competitive scene of this game, as it motivates my game as well ( currently at 11 solo wins lol). One thing I felt is lacking is a sufficient way to determine which players are the best. Yea, we have K/D ratio, Kills per match, and Win percentage, but these all tell separate stories. What if someone put them all together?

&amp;#x200B;

So that's what I did, with TrueFN, a free Player Rankings app for iOS. You can find it [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/truefn-rankings-for-fortnite/id1448624476?ls=1&amp;mt=8). You can add one username to the leaderboard, where a TrueFN rating is calculated for you. The rating is similar to a weighted Elo system, where your stats are compared to the average Fortnite player. The current equation is as follows:  


**Weighted K/D ratio** \- 16.7% of rating  
**Weighted Win Percentage** \- 16.7% of rating

**Weighted Top 3 Placings Percentage** \- 16.7% of rating

**Weighted Top 6 Placings Percentage** \- 16.7% of rating

**Weighted Top 12 Placings Percentage** \- 16.7% of rating

**Weighted Top 25 Placings Percentage** \- 16.7% of rating

&amp;#x200B;

This might be perfect to some, this might be terrible. Either way is great to hear, as there is an area to take TrueFN calibration quizzes in the app. There, you can answer quick multiple choice questions about different ratings, and the results of these quizzes will directly influence what goes into the system. You can also submit direct feedback if you wish to as well.   


I'm passionate about Fortnite and coding, so this just happened to come together. The app is free, but there are ads to support the server costs, as non-intrusive as possible. If anyone's interested, I'd love for people to try it and offer feedback.

i know shotguns are strong is this game but sometimes they feel like the only viable gun most of the time. ",FortNiteBR

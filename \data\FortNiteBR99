It may not seem like a big deal but it is. Auto-fire. Instead of tapping a button to shoot, the game shoots for you. Let’s say you try to make an edit play on one. They will shoot you before you can switch a gun and before they realize you edited the wall. People do not even need to be aware of someone and it shoots. Let’s say someone is in the weeds at fatal, using a snowman, or using a Bush, it will shoot them if it’s in the crosshairs. auto-fire does not belong in this game. ",FortNiteBR

When a player can throw up walls faster than a minigun can spit out bullets, building is op

When a player can throw up a new wall before the smoke from a rocket even clears, building is op

Part of multiplayer shooters is environmental awareness. There is absolutely no repercussion for not being aware of your surroundings in this game. You catch someone off guard or not looking?

Too bad they spam walls as soon as they hear a shot. Thats not skill, and its not “building”. Its just spamming walls.

Most responses to this opinion will be “you can’t build bro”, “found the bot”, “its FORTnite for a reason”

Well I have been playing since season 2 and I use to build every game. But the way building has been coddled and protected in this game has undermined its whole purpose. Building is suppose to be about structure and iq defense and thats what it was at one time.

Now its just a bunch of people spamming walls and shitty ramps thinking that they are “competitive”. You aren’t competitive my dude, you are exploiting a tool in the game to avoid combat",FortNiteBR

It is not a C.O.D. team death match. Where half the lobby is winners and half are losers. Solo 99% will lose. Dous 98% will lose. Squads 96% will lose. SBMM isn't going to change that. Odds are you're going to lose.

  The truth is. If all you whiners and quitters still played. Matchmaking would most likely put 100 of you in the same lobby.  But the majority of you would lose as designed and you would still complain. Then say it wasn't fair in game where any player who can't build can third party a fight by kamikazeing a plane spamming its guns into a wounded pro player mid fight then jump off and hit them with a rocket if the plane didn't finish job sending them back to the lobby.

  Exactly what percentage of players do you think are pros? Oh the guy who killed me had TTV, YT or Twitch in his name. I didn't know only pros could stream or use those in their names. Check their stats. Odds are they are bad too. 

  As a longtime gamer and only average Fortnite player. SBMM will ruin it. Just like any online game that has tried before. Wins will mean less. You'll never possibly get lucky and have the satisfaction of seeing an actual pro fall to you in the kill feed. You'll never be tested or get any better playing people of the same progression. No records will be set anymore or we will just have to put an asterisk next to them now. How much will you enjoy watching you favorite pro player play just like you every match, struggling to win?

  Yes, lobbies are getting harder now. It's not because players are getting that much better. The lobbies are getting harder cause the quitters quit.  The makers of this game have given the underdog every chance to win though. Bloom, too many mobility items creating non stop third party fights, explosives, lack of shield to name a few. 

  The only fix to this is changing your attitude. Take the loss. Learn from it. Realize the majority are losers in a battle royal. Never give up. Encourage other people not to be quitters. Repopulate the player pool with players just like you. Casuals who just want to or only can play for an hour or so week. Casuals are the majority. The skill gap didn't increase. The quitters just quit. Don't be a quitter. Problem solved.

But the actual result of having a Battle Pass that requires so much effort is that it makes me hate the game. I resent having to go on every single day to let the daily challenges line up, and it kills any joy to the game. I no longer want to play for PLAYING's sake because I'm forced to do it every day anyway to finish the stupid pass (which has sucked the last two or three times anyway).

Epic needs to:

1. Make it shorter. Maybe 75 tiers. Get rid of the useless shit filler that no one wants to accomplish this. Every tier is made more meaningful because it's not a dumb sticker every time. I don't have to stress about not logging in for a few days at a time. I'll have more time to spend ENJOYING the game like I used to.
2. Make BP challenges less annoying. This will take some creativity and I don't know that they have it in them, but I wish them the best. It is annoying to have to play five games because the next step in a challenge doesn't appear until the one before it is done. It's infuriating. It's lazy.
3. Make the ""place top 6/12 in squads"" challenges rarer. Like me, my friends enjoy the game less and less every day, and rarely is there ever quorum to actually do this challenge.

That's all I have for now.

Until this happens I will not be getting the next Battle Pass (or subsequent Battle Passes). Being stuck in a prison of my own creation, having to force myself to complete it because that's what I'm paying for, is the worst feeling. Fortnite is a fun game but it's not *that* fun. ",FortNiteBR

Plane: Can fly. shots from a plane feel like they do 99 damage. aka too op, but is staying in the game because a challenge is attached to it.
aka put it in the vault in season 8

Quadcrasher: Perfect vehicle. can fly but cant shoot in! (unless theres two players in the vehicle) goes fast. aka insanely balanced and fun for knocking people 300m into the sky.

Every vehicle besides the quadcrasher is busted or useless. shopping carts useless. ATK useless. Planes aka the third party machines. and the good quad which is perfect!

Not only would this be beneficial to more competitive players, who tend to go to play Apex or CSGO because of Fortnite's lack of ranked system/skilled base matchamaking, the more casual players will not lose their motivation and interest in this game because they get killed by more experienced players without having a chance to fight back. 

Although Fortnite is a royal battle where it is important that the victories are the result of effort and where the players who try to improve are rewarded, Epic does not seem to realize that every day they lose loyal players because of the skills gap imposed in the lobbies.

There is much more value in keeping loyal customers than trying to get new ones every day. Moreover, with the already active lot of players, I believe it is now time for Epic to focus on a healthy gaming environment and a system that will work in the long run.

I love this game since its release and I am extremely grateful that Epic is (most of the time) listening to our community. However, their lack of communication about the competitive system worries me, since I want Fortnite to stay relevant for the longest time possible.

I have a lot of hope for Season 8, but I think it's important for our community to get involved in this issue that affects the majority of players. Together, it's possible to get what I think would be best for Fortnite and its players.

tl;dr: I love this game and I want it to be successful in the longrun. Therefore, I think Epic should add a Ranked system if they want their game to stay relevant for the competitive AND casual players.

Exploiting means to use something unfairly for your own advantage. As we all know, editing wasnt meant to be used like the pro players use it nowadays.
Its meant to exit structures or to have a better view from your base, not to confuse people by editing a triangle, resetting, editing a window, resetting, editing a window on the left, etc.

So basically this is an exploit, right?

And if so: Epic should nerf it. As a console player i feel very disadvantaged in the pop up cups because i edit that fast.
I mean, they will nerf ADS spam, which is also an exploit, because pc players said that its too OP and unfair. So epic should nerf edit-spam because only pc players can master it which leads to a bigger skill gap.",FortNiteBR

I think a lot of the community suggestions should be implemented into the game such as;

- Nerfing planes - Removing the weapon on planes - etc.
- Adding a interact key to zip lines
- Adding ranked
- Nerfing RPGs
- Nerfing Deagle

I might not agree with everything the community says, but it's the majority of what people want that will make the game succeed.

There are also a lot more suggestions that people want, that I can't think off the top of my head.

I just hope they are planning something big here in the next few days or so to really show that Fortnite is the best game and no game will take the #1 spot for a long time.",FortNiteBR

My hearing is fine, I can hear in both ears but my right ear weaker because I have vertigo and tinnitus.

Epic has a colorblind mode, rightfully pandering the game to those which disabilities yet hearing is an integral part of the game. It feels like epic is saying that only certain disabilities can play the game and honestly, that’s a little disheartening.

I think what Epic should implement next season is weapon attachments. This way they can slow down in adding new weapons to the game, and give players the chance to have different versions of the same weapons.

Examples they can add:

Handle grips - ADS faster, reduced ""recoil"" for weapons like the heavy AR

Laser Sights - Decreased hipfire bloom

Extended Mags - Scales based on weapon (or a flat 5 increase for ARs and something like 2 for shotguns)

Coated Ammo - Does more damage to materials

Zoom-Sights for Snipers - Allows multiple zoom settings for snipers

These are just a few examples, and although it makes the game closer to other games like COD, it adds an interesting concept. The idea is you hold the gun you want to attach the attachment to, walk over the attachment, and press your pick up button. The attachment is now permanently attached to your weapon and on death, can be seen while looting such as: ""Legendary Scar - Extended Mags"". You won't be able to switch attachments and can't have more than one, and will bring an interesting choice for players, i.e do you rock a legendary scar with no attachments? or swap it with and Epic scar you loot from a player that has a laser sight?",FortNiteBR

Although the game has brought in so many players and done live events like the Rocket, the Cube, the Butterfly, the Concert and more to come, people still diss the game and the developers and call them lazy, although they don't even know how to code a 3D Character to walk.

&amp;#x200B;

A lot of people said Blackout is going to kill Fortnite!, I haven't seen a single person talk about Blackout since the week after release. And this new game, Apex Legends. Apparently, it's good, but I don't think the devs are as dedicated as Epics'.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic brings out updates to Fortnite every week. Some find it annoying as it requires time and internet to download, but it keeps the game interesting. Epic does in-game events that bring in millions of players and break records. The butterfly event brought in 8.3 million players breaking the record of 8 million held by CrossFire.

&amp;#x200B;

The very recent Marshmello Concert \*apparently\* brought in 10 million+ people breaking the record for most concurrent players in a game AND the biggest concert. And Marshmello also spoke to CourageJD saying that all of the voice was live and not pre-recorded. What other devs have the dedication to figure how to do that. Every other dev woulda just pre-recorded it and chucked it in the files.

I've always memed on Fortnite, but I really appreciate how much goes into the game constantly. From the outside looking in it always seemed like there was something big going on, and that always seemed really cool to me.

While it may still be fun to poke some fun at Fortnite, it really does deserve its top spot among the BR games. I can't see any game taking down the Fortnite giant anytime soon, especially with how much goes on.

I just picked up my first Battle Pass, and I can't wait to have fun playing the game and experiencing some of the cool things I always see coming out of this game.

The new thing is that you can recover your teammate's banner after they have been thirsted or bled out and then take that banner to a respawn location and your teammate can be brought back to life there. They'll respawn with nothing, but at least they're alive. The banner lasts for maybe 90 seconds after the downed player dies.

This system allows you to fight like normal instead of rush over and try to stop someone from thirsting your teammate. It's a cool solution to a ""problem"" that BRs have where you have to sit and watch your team play an entire game if you die in an early fight.",FortNiteBR

Just build lol is a meme but it is such a powerful element of the game.  Just build ...what?   How?  When?  

I do think classes would be interesting for fortnite to experiment with.  The dependence that creates within a team will help with the problem of every squad having that one guy that goes to tilted.  

I’ve already won a few times in AL while victories in fortnite are still tough to come by.

Also while I fully and personally support cross platform play, PC gamers have way many more advantages than just ‘Aim Assist’.. the average gamer does not care about build battles.. all these kids and streamers are ruining this amazing game..

There really needs to be a spam-build limit nerf like they did to double pumping.. after so many walls, floors, or whatever built there should be a delay or something.. Epic themselves said they don’t want people winning only because of building.. been playing every day since February last year and I’m only sick of it because it all comes down to building.. is this an r/unpopularopinion ? Or do a lot more people feel this way?

pop up is not enough we need a ranked mode which u can access at any time and also not require multiple hours of gameplay to seperate the players. we need SBMM.

I know this has probably been brought up before, but the lack of this feature at this point is genuinely causing me to choose to play other games, because I know for sure if I fire up to play solo, it's gonna be a spamfest for invites. I can appear offline on my gaming system, but I have no way to do so on Fortnite - which means that as soon as I sign in, I get spammed from invites from people who I like to play with sometimes, but not ALL the time. It's even worse for my kid, who is Epic Friends with kids from school, and they'll spam him 50 times during a match. Booting them from our friends lists is not an option - these are cousins, classmates, etc, people who we try to maintain good relationships with and who we like to play with from time to time. The away feature does nothing, in my opinion. People either ignore it, or the second you get in the game it switches back to available.

It seems like this is something that should be common sense to have as a feature, so I wonder if there's a reason that it hasn't been implemented. If that's the case - maybe we can get a comment explaining it?

It leads to people messing up, getting stressed and just generally not wanting to do it anymore. If you’ve seen the report about how much epic is working the staff you can clearly see how bad it is, it results in mental illness and lack of motivation. 

If you had to work 70 hours a week, constantly getting more work and a toxic community screaming at you how would you feel? The devs have to do everything as fast as they can and any complaint results in a mark against you, this leads to people being scared and not doing what they think is right. 

Epic should change it so we get 1 update every 2 weeks or so and have a poll so the community can say what they want. This means we will be getting updates and minimal complaints will he made as it is what the majority wants. The way epic is treating the staff is horrible and this will probably get removed but something has to happen.",FortNiteBR

Too many times the client side and server side pellet count are way off.  Due to these issues you’re seeing players hit full pellet counts for 40 damage or even less at extremely close range.

I’m proposing a fix.  In order to fix this issue shotguns temporarily need to do a flat damage amount similar to every other weapon in this game (given range), with **no** additional headshot multiplier.  I imagine a meta change would be created, which I’m sure would be refreshing to a lot of players.

The only way the game will improve is if more people play and enjoy the game, not by spreading your POS toxic, cancerous, ""OG"" culture.

There has to be a better way to manage the workload at the company without burning through employees like they are currently doing. And it seems like the people at Epic who aren't undergoing intense crunch are the managers ordering their employees to crunch. 

It's really a fucked up system. They're not leading by example. And we as a community shouldn't be held to blame. 

It's assumed that we ask a lot from Epic with constant updates and changes and whatnot. But we really don't. Most of us just want Fortnite to reach an optimized playable state and for it to stay that way.

I don't need an update every 2 weeks. I really don't. I like big macro changes every season. Not tiny micro changes bi-weekly. 

My dad used to say ""work smarter not harder"". And it's clear that the people running Epic don't get that. There's a path for everyone to get what they want but they don't realize it. 

Tim Sweeney is probably the biggest prick of them all. It's his employees that are miserable. It's his responsibility to fix it.",FortNiteBR

I am a long time Fortnite player (season 1 to be exact) and I love the game however recently due to how bad the bugs are I just can’t play. Hitches and random lag spikes are pretty much a given for every match, and it’s honestly to the point where I just can’t sometimes. I play on an average of 30-35 consistent ping on pretty much every game I play except Fortnite. I’ll be running 30 pings 60 FPS and then just out of no where go from 30-140-500 ping and drop back down 15 seconds later. Even with a wired connection I have this issue and I find it unbelievable that this is what I experience when I just want to play pubs with my friends. Not to mention the countless blank shotgun hits I get per game. I am also a very competitive Fortnite player and I made it to division 7 in arena and just stopped playing it because frames in end game are non existent. The game feels so choppy and so slow that I just can’t keep up at the end. I have had several games where my frames have dropped so bad that I get killed because I can’t tell when my wall is broken or if my edit got confirmed.

This is somewhat a continuation of another thread on here, which talks about the exclusive interview of epic games employees. I would just like to share my opinion about the game, the employees, and I would also like to share an idea that I think could help save Fortnite. So, sit back and grab some popcorn, as a somewhat long read awaits you. 

I honestly believe that you guys should just finish season 8 with one final update that completely balances the game for now, until it is completely finished and out of early access. Stop updating the game every single week, it is insane and clearly is not working, not just for the fans of the game but for the company itself. Yeah it may work the bring in the big bucks and keep all the little kiddies playing, but in the long term this system just wont work. With this idea, ending the weekly updates for a while at the end of season 8 will not only allow for MUCH more, NEEDED time, for the developers to work on the game, it would also leave us wanting more and hyped to see what you guys can achieve without having constant stress from everyone hindering you, because the employees of Epic Games and developers of Fortnite are amazing in my opinion, just imagine what they could do if they were able to take it slower and take their time on the game.

With this idea in motion, we could expect to see:
- Major improvements to the morale of the employees at Epic, which means more passion and fun when it comes to creating for the game.
- An actual, well-thought-out story not only for STW but Battle Royale too. (We all know how horrible all the plot-holes throughout the seasons have been, like honestly wtf was season 6)
- A good meta that wont be changed every week as a result of extended testing for weapons and utilities. With much more time to work, I know for a fact Epic can make a great meta if they stop caring just about money and keeping the kids playing.
- A true loyal fanbase would form, instead of just bandwagons and memes. So basically this game would have a better chance of lasting years with a non-toxic loyal fanbase, then the current toxic fanbase full of children. 

Epic needs to realize that its not all about the money, because sooner or later the next REAL big thing will come out, and Epic wont be able to hold onto the kids who play their game anymore as 1. they grow older and 2. the battle royale genre is knocked off its pedestal from something new. We all know its coming, people are tired of BR games. So Epic, imo your best bet would be to forget about the money coming from all the little kids, because sooner or later it can all be gone if you keep this up. I would not mind paying $60 for a fully complete Fortnite, just saying. Thank you for reading and I hope my ideas were clear and easy to read, and I hope this post is seen by someone at Epic because I really do wanna see this game reach its full potential instead of it just getting worse with each season.

While many of you are young and might not understand, this is more than anything a human tragedy caused by greed and arrogance. While some might think that this is no big deal, you are wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

People are suffering from health issues and breaking down because WE demand more content and features every week. I am to blame too. I often come to these forums and make rants about how the game is so broken with all the bugs and all the features that they should remove, but it never crossed my mind that there might be a person that is just taking orders from someone above. I am not a streamer and do not have a big of an audience to maybe start a movement but I do have a keyboard as my gun and words as my bullets. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't feel comfortable playing a game while knowing that there are folks out there that are working 100 hours a WEEK and that is EXPECTED from them and any sign of not wanting to work those hours is deemed as a weakness and therefore they are just fired. This is the main reasons I HATE corporations. Corporations have the mental traits of a psychopath. They do not care for others but themselves. Their only goal is to make the shareholders stupidly wealthy.  They disregard the environment and simply couldn't care less for the damage of others. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think the only way that Epic will listen is if we vote with our dollars as a community. Not spending money on this game will force them to listen to us. Even if we are 1.1M players we still have some power and we can make a dent.

HP on Kill and materials on kill was the best Fortnite I have ever played. I understand some people might not like the feature, or don’t care for it. I also know many loved it. 

Yes I do understand that Epic didn’t like how the game turned out with this feature. However I also understand that the players loved it. You can never please everyone but must try to please as many as possible.

The most frustrating part of all of this isn’t just the fact that this feature is gone, it’s that I feel like the community is being completely ignored. I loved the Fortnite that always listened, the Fortnite that was very transparent with the community. It hurts me to see my favorite game become a game I no longer like as much.

I made many great friends, and countless amazing moments on this game. I have so many great memories. I no longer play with those friends because they want nothing to do with the game. I no longer make memories because they are gone.

Yes the feature wasn’t there before and I still truly loved the game. But as soon as it was introduced I found that the game was more fun that I had realized. Epic didn’t like the way their players played. However I’d like to point out that removing this feature didn’t remove those play styles. I find it only possible to win by playing very passive and not pushing fights. The greatest memories I had were the action packed fights I got into with other players and my friends.

Arena is fun and all but I don’t want to play like it’s a scrim every single match. Arena is a great feature to the game but it was never necessary to remove HP on kill from other modes.

The game isn’t what it could be. If anyone at Epic reads this, please explain how this is the best choice for the game. I’d love to hear how this is really what the game needed. Thousands say go back and we are neglected with silence.

Lol thank you for your downvote. You are the problem.

For the rest of you, as you probably already know the strength of aim assist is directly linked to your FPS.

This means that Xbox One and Xbox One S @ 30FPS has half the aim assist as the Xbox One X @60

Basically, aim assist isn’t even balanced with itself.

Let’s imagine that at some point they separated tournaments by input. Xbox One X players would have a huge advantage.

This leaves us in the same position as we are now with one platform being superior. 

Because of this I think epic need to adjust aim assist somehow and make it more balanced. Because as you can see it’s not even balanced across consoles alone.",FortNiteBR

Users search them and then can join a queue to join with other players. It would be great for those who want to play these awesome game modes but don’t have a bunch of friends who play. 

They could make it where anyone can submit a game or they be approved manually be Epic. Both have positives and negatives.

Console l2/aim assist is normal but players playing controller on PC is something that should been looked into because how efficient l2 spamming and aim assist is. You may wonder why , its simple because of the higher fps and it has been so annoying for last month that its unbelievable Arena 400+ points as soon i get lasered in a sec -150dmg its always a GUY who played on PS4 and switched on PC. I don't know why people still say Ohhh you can aim better with pc Are you actually kidding me first of all Lets say you are behind a guy and if you want to laser him you have to hit your first bullet which is first shoot accuracy right? and then spray = bloom which is pure luck and in most situations you barely hit him twice. While controllers playing on PC watching aydan/nickmers and every single player on PC who knows how to abuse L2 are lasering people around like its nothing it has been super frustrating thing. I still think that PC have advantages but not that big as l2 spamming which is basically AIMBOT for people who know how to abuse it. Pc players still need to wait for first shoot accuracy each time they are shooting or just shoot with bloom and miss easily 40-70% shots. Controllers is in situation where they can edit/build like PC players easily the good ones so why not finally NERF l2 spamming for controllers? I see people hitting 7shots in a row spamming l2 not even waiting for first shoot accuracy each time lol its basically an AIMBOT for god sake and its sad that toxic 10y kids are happy that they are getting aimbot instead of aim assist which is sad.",FortNiteBR

In light of the [recent interview with an alleged epic employee](https://www.polygon.com/2019/4/23/18507750/fortnite-work-crunch-epic-games) where it is said that the developers are ""forced"" to work for average 70 hour and even up to 100 hour weeks to the standard that their bosses are expecting, or risk being fired. And looking at the comments on the post is just people praising the developers, for working inhuman times for over a year now. 
  
Here's a quote from the article. 
&gt;The company gives us unlimited time off, but it’s almost impossible to take the time. If I take time off, the workload falls on other people, and no one wants to be that guy. 
And here's another quote. 
&gt;“If I got to the end of an eight-hour workday and I turned to my supervisor to ask if I needed to stay on, they’d often look at me as if I was actively stupid. Officially, you don’t have to keep working, but in reality: ‘Sit back down, we’ll be here for a while.’ If you did not do overtime, that was a mark against your character.”
  
An employee shouldn't have to choose whether they want to be disliked by their bosses or their co-workers. The fact that someone anonymously came out to speak about the poor work environment really speaks of how much a change is needed.
  
Here's yet another quote from the article. 
  
“The biggest problem is that we’re patching all the time. The executives are focused on keeping Fortnite popular for as long as possible, especially with all the new competition that’s coming in.”
  
Now to see the reactions on the original post, praising epic for continuously releasing updates even though their employees are burned out, is just insane. I saw comments of people saying they've gained respect and will stop complaining about the updates and not realizing they're missing the entire point of the interview. Exactly what is said in the quote. I get that they want to keep the game popular with the weekly updates, but at the cost of what? New game breaking bugs every week and a reputation as a bad employer? Doesn't really seem worth it in the long run. 
  
I highly advice everyone to read the interview linked at the top in its entirety. Even though a lot of people on here might be young and don't really have any work experience, try to imagine being forced to be in school for 10 hours every day, including weekends, or the teachers will turn on you and lower your grade. Just because they want to stay ahead of the others schools in the area.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you've all heard that the Epic Games employees working on Fortnite are being overworked. The reason they're overworking themselves so much is because they love both us, as a community, and the amazing game that they've dedicated all their time into. They're likely scared that if they don't keep working on the game without break to improve it for us, then the game will fall apart. So they're doing their absolute best for us and for the game!  


But the fact is, Epic is still getting hated on. All their hard work is being shoved down, and treated like it's garbage. The game and the developers are being ridiculed with insults. The community refuses to be satisfied. It's a big issue, and something NEEDS to be done about it.  


# Just take a moment and think about everything they've done for us, and this wonderful game they've provided for us. About all the wonderful memories and experiences we've had due to this game.

  
And yet, you're still giving them hate?

# So, instead of giving them hate, let's show them our love!

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not one to ask for things like this, but each like, share, use of the hashtag and image, and so on will show that you love and support Epic for what they do! Let's encourage them to keep doing their best, but also to take care of themselves. Let's let the developers know that their hard work means the world to us!

32 v 32 : we know it's possible. We have seen it before when Marshmello's Event happened.

200/300 Kill Objective: to balance with the amount of people that will be in a team

Balanced Spawning: Make people respawn on their side of the map. Can't count how many times I've respawned on the side cluttered with enemies and couldn't land anywhere because I just kept getting killed and I know others have had it happen, too.

Increased Llama Spawn: Just like in Disco Domination. It would make sense to have it for large team modes. Now this is optional however.

Spawning of only Rare and above weapons as well as decreased Heavy AR Spawn. Too many Green weapons, not enough other ARs besides heavy.",FortNiteBR

 Aim assist is necessary for Console players.

Here's why.

Just think about the basic maneuver of jumping and keeping the dot on your enemy at the same time. For a PC player, this is a two handed action. For a console player, this is a one handed action that requires us to take our thumb off the joystick we aim with, press x to jump, and come back to the joystick to quickly adjust back to target. Aim assist provides a small grab on the target while jumping, and essentially is our second hand. When using a SCUF, that grab isn't really necessary, but to defend SCUF users, we also don't get an ADS option while in the air.

Also, console players get to use our thumb to aim. Quite a few muscles in there, isn't terrible after playing on the same controller for years and years, but a PC player gets to use their hand, wrist, and arm to fine tune their dot's position on the screen. Considerably more muscles involved in that action, so no I don't believe aim assist is necessary for a PC player.

My only argument is that even with aim assist, the top PC players can fine tune their aim better than the top console player. I don't believe this calls for separate pools, I don't believe PC should get an aim assist option, and I don't believe console players should be defensive about this. 

Ultimately as I said, part of the process of simply jumping and aiming at a person is automated on Console, but for the reason that if it wasn't, and you didn't own a scuff, there would be an actual disadvantage present for console players.",FortNiteBR

I remember one time when one Overwatch streamer thought it would be fun to stream himself starting from the lower ranks and making his way up, but along the way he destroyed the matches for everyone else involved, he obviously got a ton of backlash and had to post an apology.

Was this mode designed by the CEO's son or something?  The mode is so shite in every way, how did it even get approved in the first place?  

Here's one example: Why do the fucking tomato and hamburger look the same?  You could have easily designed the shapes to not be so similar and not put prominent red coloring into the hamburger and prominent green coloring into the tomato, but for some reason the most shit design choice possible was made and approved, making it extremely difficult to tell immediately who is on which team.  Seriously, hamburger doesn't need to have prominent red coloring, nor does tomato need prominent green coloring, only a smidgeon of green is necessary, yet these choices were made as if the mode was designed by people with anti-talent, people intentionally doing a bad job, or people with some sort of mental defect.  And that's just the design aspect of the team heads, there are multiple other problems with just the implementation of the character heads in this mode.

With literally every single aspect of this mode the design and implementation choices are terrible.  Want another example?  How about how people are supposed to fight to the death in the sky but most of them run low or out of ammo after only half the fight?  Of course they could spend time harvesting more ammo... BUT NO TIME IS GIVEN TO HARVEST, the storm starts as soon as the plane drops and the lava rises insanely fast.  And why is the fucking wall there, and why does the wall have to be so wide it covers 15% of the map?  The width of the wall of course is not shown on the map so it is difficult to predict what items and areas are actually accessible without actually walking all the way to the wall itself. 
 This enormously wide wall further limits ability to harvest and ensures that we are trapped in a box for five minutes with nothing to do but harvest yet with limited harvesting options due to immediate storm rushing at us and rising lava.

Not only is this game mode NOT fun, it is actually depressing because of how bad it is and the fact that it has for some reason been approved.  YET IT LINGERS!  Please make it go away.",FortNiteBR

this way, challenges that require grinding (aka certain ruin challenges and others alike), can be done easier, it makes casual play more interesting for new comers, breaking 'Defaults' into the game, they get a taste for hardcore players, and casuals.

If this got added, I'm sure I wouldn't be the only one that would be super pleased.

The game is still in Early Access?"," **Early access** to a **game** is typically offered when the **game** is in a playable state but may not be feature-**complete**, or may still have several software bugs to be found. Often these **games** are considered at alpha or beta releases, and may be months or years from anticipated completion.   


 **Early access**, also known as **early funding**, **alpha-access**, or **paid-alpha**, is a funding model in the [video game industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_industry) by which consumers can purchase and play a game in the various pre-release [development cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle), such as pre-alpha, alpha, and/or beta, while the developer is able to use those funds to continue further development on the game. Those that pay to participate typically help to debug the game, provide feedback and suggestions, and may have access to special materials in the game. The early-access approach is a common way to obtain funding for [indie games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game), and may also be used along with other funding mechanisms, including [crowdfunding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding). Many crowdfunding projects promise to offer access to alpha and/or beta versions of the game as development progresses; however, unlike some of these projects which solicit funds but do not yet have a playable game, all early access games offer an immediately playable version of the unfinished game to players. 

&amp;#x200B;

 

Traditionally, game publishers do not release unfinished versions of their products to the public, instead relying on in-house testing [non-disclosure agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreements). This prevents such versions from becoming the target of [software piracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_piracy), and limits what information can potentially be shared with competitors.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access#cite_note-gamasutra-1) As such, publishers will fund the full development of a game through its completion, but will be less willing to take risks on experimental titles. In some cases, publishers have found ways to allow players to win or buy into access into a game's beta state in a controlled environment. For example, an invitation to the beta version of the multiplayer portion of [*Halo 3*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_3) was bundled with the game [*Crackdown*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crackdown), contributing to the latter's strong sales.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access#cite_note-computerworld-2)

For indie games, which are typically distributed without a publisher, the source of funding for development is not as readily available. Many smaller indie companies use personal funds, while larger ones may get investments from other sources, and more recently crowdfunding programs like [Kickstarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickstarter) have proven viable for both. Another difficulty for indie developers is the means of testing their games prior to release, lacking the resources of a publisher and not obtaining enough feedback prior to release.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access#cite_note-gamasutra-1)

The concept of early access helps to alleviate both problems. Early access to a game is typically offered when the game is in a playable state but may not be feature-complete, or may still have several software bugs to be found. Often these games are considered at [alpha or beta releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle), and may be months or years from anticipated completion. Interested players are able to buy into the development of the game, gaining access to the software in the working state, and are encouraged to play and stress-test the software. Their feedback can help the developer tune the game's direction, art, and software mechanics in anticipation of a final release. Once the game is released, the player either continues to have access to the software or is rewarded with a means to obtain the final release of the title and other extras, such as sounds, their name in the game's credits, or other rewards. These players help fund the game to completion, but take a risk that the game may never reach a final release.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access#cite_note-computerworld-2) A further benefit can come from preliminary word-of-mouth of a game in an early access state. As players are typically not limited by confidentiality agreements to participate in early access, these players can provide reviews on social media, or play the game on streaming broadcasts, which subsequently can stimulate interest in the title.

One of the best-known early examples of this model is [*Minecraft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft). The game's development began in 2009 by [Markus Persson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson) initially for [internet browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_browser) that he developed alongside his full-time job. The alpha-version game proved popular enough that within the month of release, Persson added a means by which players could pay 10 [euros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euros)(approximately US$15) to access the game, allowing him to continue its development. As sales of the game increased, he was able to quit his job about eight months later to work on the game full-time, founding [Mojang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojang) to bring on a larger development team. *Minecraft* continued to offer early access throughout its development period, assuring those that bought into it would receive the final version for free, which happened in November 2011. Prior to this, nearly two million players had purchased into the alpha- and beta-stage releases, with over $33 million raised from these early sales.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_access#cite_note-3) *Minecraft*'s success led to the early access approach becoming a popular way to publishing indie titles.

1: The Heavy shotgun- The heavy is my fav all time shotgun. Yes, the legendary variants of the pump, are better, but this gun had range for a shotgun. Maybe bring it back with a rarity change? 
2: The tac SMG- once you introduced the SMG meta to fortnite, you took away in my opinion the most balanced of them all. The tac smg has the perfect rate of fire with the oerrect amount of ammo, and great range. Please I want it back. 
3: The FAMAS- A lot of people may disagree, but I know a lot of people who want the burst back. It had insane accuracy, and great rate of fire 
4: The revolver- what’s a shooter game without a crappy gun? The revolver isn’t even that bad! Yes, maybe buff the accuracy a bit, but the revolver was decent. 
5: GREASY GROVE- GREAsy was one of my fav locations. It had amazing loot spots
6- HEALTH AND SHEILD FRO KILL-  I don’t need to explain.

Too long. It seriously needs to be fixed. If someone is in a building structure they should not be able to walk through it. They should get pushed back, forward, up or down the build respectively of which build they are in and which part of the build they’re mostly in because walking through a floor or triangle when only their head is over it should not be possible. 

No, I’m not complaining because I just died but because it’s just a really annoying “feature”. This makes early game fights with little to no weapons or ammo useless because everyone is running straight through everything. Also being able to shoot through this is even more annoying. This just needs to be fixed or reverted to what it used to be.




The second problem is not being able to scope in after you start shooting an smg or any ar. I don’t know if this is a feature or glitch but all I know is that it needs to be fixed/removed. There is no point for this to be in the game.",FortNiteBR

\-If it was then they would have all passed the lake at some point, only green has done so.

\-Even when it passes the rune the laser bends ( [https://imgur.com/a/zueyhS5](https://imgur.com/a/zueyhS5) )

\-All 3 keep moving 1 position then returning again, the chances of all 3 being exactly 1 position from the full 360 turn is very unlikely.

\-When green linked to the run at the lake it made a loud noise and started shooting some kind of green swirls from the pedestal which stopped once the damage let off a bit.

\-Everyone was going crazy posting and hitting the green one when it first appeared so surely if we were hitting it too much then it would have not been moving then? Which it was..

I fail to understand their logic on this one tbh. They put a mode in the game for 7 weeks, then replace it with a piece of shit that nobody likes, and then pretend nothing is wrong.

They already alienated their competitive playerbase with siphon changes, balls, etc. and now they're doing the same to the much larger casual playerbase by taking out their favorite mode and replacing it with something un-fun and all around terrible.

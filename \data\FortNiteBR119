The game is really unbalanced. Fortnite literally made me buy a new headset. Let alone, all the useless V bucks that I spent on it. They don’t do anything but make you look “cool”. This game is the most popular cash grab I’ve seen in years. I’d rather play a poorly made Google Play game that was made in Unity in a day. ",FortNiteBR

If I wanted to play for kills, and have it actually mean something, I'd play Rumble (rip). Rumble was truly the best LTM for respawns, simply because the objective WAS killing. There was nothing else. It was easy for everyone to feel like they were doing some sort of part in the victory. With Disco, I rarely ever win because people are so focused on getting kills. I'm so glad they took out the middle objective, but, everyone on my team still congregates in the middle regardless.

I can’t tell you how many times I’m in a top 5 situation, and I get spammed with either RPGs or Quad Launchers. Or someone finds a launcher off spawn and kills the both of us together. 

As it stands right now, I do not believe there is a balanced counter to them, as “just build” can only take you so far. All it takes is for one rocket to sneak into your general vicinity and boom — your health is tanked. 

I think one of the two should be vaulted or at least given a serious nerf, as that kind of play style makes the game significantly less fun to play against. 

I’d love to hear your thoughts. ",FortNiteBR

This will encourage players to get in fights in the lategame and rewards you for killing people.
This way players wont die so easily and we might have more than 30 people in game once the first circle closes since players without healables get atleast some health back.

I believe this should just be tested just like the 25% faster battlebus we had tested in season 6.

I no way was using 2 shotguns ever balanced. My solution was to nerf them to make it balanced, so everyone isn’t forced to use shotgun-deagle or shotgun-smg. And in this way not everyone is forced to run 2 shotguns.

I propose: gray pump.

This shotgun would do 75 body damage max and 150 headshot damage max.

If you shoot a gray pump and switch to another grey pump, the circle load timer would be changed from 1.3 seconds to 0.9 seconds.

If you shot a grey pump and switched to a grey tactical, the circle load timer would be changed from 1.3 seconds to 0.7 seconds(same in reverse but using tac-pump would be kinda weird)

If you do anything other than that, the circle timer stays at 1.3.

It would also introduce 2 new playstyles: slow shooting but high damage(pump-pump), or faster shooting with a bit lower damage(pump-tac).

If you guys think this is too op, leave suggestions on how to change it. Maybe the body damage could be reduced to 70. The reason this is more balanced is because pumps have low fire rate for high damage, right? Well this shotgun has a low fire rate and low damage, leaving it balanced to run 2.",FortNiteBR

Planes should not be able to just break through walls. They're already good enough for long distance transport and have guns with the plus that in squads your teammates can shoot while flying. If planes are staying in the game take away the ability to break through houses and buildings. Also make the redeploy jumping out of planes the slowed down redeploy they shortly implemented for some time. That way it would be more balanced. Instead of being able to just dive Right down out of a plane and land on someone you should be slowed down while gliding. The gun on the planes can shred through a wall in a couple seconds which is already powerful enough. Flying a plane should be a risk with it's huge advantage already being storm evasion. A huge part of this game is staying on top of the storm and being aware of the game progression. Now with planes the storm is hardly a key aspect given you can fly across the whole map in 30 seconds. I've been very frustrated by these damn things lately and I know people have probably posted about planes to oblivion but I just wanted to voice my opinion and suggestion because I am really fed up with them.

&amp;#x200B;

***Remember - this is just my opinion!***

&amp;#x200B;

You saw from the title that I said **""I like bloom""**. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would say I'm an ok player. I play mainly on Nintendo Switch but sometimes on PC/PS4. I have around a 4 or 5 k/d and am relatively good at building and ok at editing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting into it, while I like bloom. *I don't love it*. In my opinion, there needs to be one skill based aspect of Fortnite, and this should be building. I really don't like the build nerfs that keep happening because they really are damaging to skill based play. However, having no bloom would destroy reaction building. Being able to hear/take a hit from a direction and react to defend yourself is what makes fortnite special. No other game does this and that is one of the main reasons fn became popular. Getting lasered very quickly and not really being able to react is pretty much any other br game and really takes building out of the image, because why move into a build battle when you could safely sit and pop 100% accurate shots off with an AR, making shooting the skill based element of fortnite and almost negating building - which as I said a second ago is what makes fortnite special.

Another thing bloom does is cater to new players. New players need to have something on their side - playing a match for the first time and just getting destroyed by the huge skill gap created would make some people turn away and move to another game. This problem is made worse due to fortnite having no skill based matchmaking. Having new players leave is damaging to Epic as a company as it means there are less people willing to spend money on the game but also to the community as it means that the amount of people on YT, Twitch and even reddit wanting fortnite content will drop - potentially preventing the pro streamers and content creators who rely on fortnite content to make a living from this content, in extreme cases forcing them over to other games. 

Finally, bloom increases building. Having mid range weapons like ARs being made unreliable due to bloom encourages players to move into closer range and build battle with say, a shotgun that is much more reliable. This stresses how bad it is for building nerf and bloom to be a thing though as having unreliable mid range and protection is not good for the balance of the game. It also means that building gets used for more than just protection and turtling as people are getting closer and aggressively trying to outbuild and take high ground from their opponent.

It seems like with every update things progressively become less skill based. So I’ve come up with a solution that will allow your casual players and competitive players to enjoy and love the game like we used to. I believe this can be achieved if Epic were to add a ranked mode alongside your normal public lobbies (Hear me out before you stop reading here as I know this has been asked for time and time again). To start you have have your normal lobbies as we’re all accustomed to with weekly updates that Epic puts out but, then you have a ranked system where any new content that gets added to the public lobbies is voted on by the player base wether the new content should be added to the ranked playlist. In order for something to pass it would have to reach a 75% passing rate. If said content doesn’t reach the passing rate it would not get added to the ranked playlist.

Hey all,

How is this for a new addition to the game. Many players have expressed their desire for more weapon slots and i believe this would be a good solution. The idea being:

* Backpacks to spawn randomly in game
* Purple (EPIC) backpacks to have 2 extra slots
* Gold (LEGENDARY) backpacks have 3 slots
* It takes 5 seconds to open the backpack and use items -or- to slide standard slots

Super keen to hear the communities thoughts... GO!!!

Have you ever tried building a wall and it builds partially below, or is obstructed by, the ground? 

In the v7.20 update we’re introducing a change that should help placement in these circumstances!

![video](xcz4c4skct921 ""Before"")

This feature will kick in when you attempt to place a structure that:

* Requires a connection to a building piece
   * The connecting piece is at least 70% underground

Under those circumstances, the required connecting piece will now build automatically and for free. In addition, the connecting piece will inherit team ownership rules (and the material type) of the desired piece.

For example 
I shoot a person with my common(grey) AR. 
Dmg= 30
Dps = 165

I shoot I shoot 6 bullets and the game pops up with a consistent 30-30-30-30-30 from the enemy I shot. 

So if 5 bullets are fired in one second that should be the dps. Which is in this case 5x30= 150 dps. 
Or if 6 bullets take 1 second it is 6x35= 180dps.

So the grey AR can never be 165 since I tested it and I give me a consistent 30.  

Now I would think it is more complicated and they added Bloom and RNG in their calculations but that would be weird since the damage is precise. 

I know for 100% that my SMG will do 17 damage from mid range. So it should be 204 dmg after 12 bullets and those 12 bullets take one second. And in the case of the SMG it is correct. But for many guns it is not. What am I doing wrong?

Some guns even have 165.5 dps. How can you hit half a bullet? I mean you hit or miss. So the last bullet counts towards that second or it doesn't count. It can't count for half right?

Maybe I am going to feel awfully stupid if someone knows it and explains it to me but I am willing to take that risk. So if anybody can help me with this it would be appreciated. ",FortNiteBR

And holy hell was it a completely different experience. The game functions so much better and makes a world of a difference. Pc guys, you need to start respecting the good console players. Heres why:

**on console:**

1)at max, you get 60fps(normally get like 30. Where pc can get 140)
2)graphics are far worse, seeing at a distance is difficult 
3)even with new controls, there is far more customization on a keyboard
4)AIM ASSIST IS NOT AUTO AIM. I can aim waaaaay better with a mouse than i ever could on console.
5)you have to toggle through every inventory slot to get to a weapon. (On pc you can instantly switch to any slot)
6)limited customization. Cant turn off shadows or limit graphics.
7)you cant jump and aim at the same time. Might sound like no big deal, but it is.

There is this stigma that console players “arent good” or they have “aim hack” and neither are true.  Console is held back in pretty much every regard. If you are a PC guy and you get shit on by a console player, give them credit and move on. Im sick and tired of seeing pros/sweats act like console players shouldnt be taken seriously.

Mad props to any of you out there who are slaying out on console, you guys are impressive as hell and deserve a ton of respect ",FortNiteBR

Basically lots hate on anything new that changes the meta of gameplay in any moderate-significant way. Pretty much every update has people flinging their entitlement issues into post after post. One commonality in these types of posts are people talking about how epic doesn't listen to their community. 

Something people don't seem to understand is that there are millions of people playing this game. That's a big number.. Of those millions, the people who complain about every single meta change in the game (read: proud and stubborn ""OGs"" ), are only a small portion of the community. There are hundreds of thousands of different people with different desires for this game's content. 

Every single update. All of them. Have had something that was requested by the community. Maybe not you new content haters, or even thousands of other people who agree with you. But many others love to see the game change. It keeps it NEW and exciting. Maybe it's bug fixes or new items or whatever, they always put in things that people ask for. Constantly. 

Along with all those generously added/updated/fixed features, from the multi-billion dollar corporation to it's player base they listen to... Along with those, they add things they feel like putting in the game. Because it's their creation and they want to see what happens with new stuff. Sometimes it's not received well by players. If it's enough of a problem, they'll change it, or even remove it, because they listen to the community. 

Planes are a big one these days.. before that it was the sword, or turrets, or bursts, or p90s or double pumps or whatever. Some of these were real issues and changes were made that have fixed those things.

But now there are tons of people talking about how broken planes are.. they just are not as big of a deal as people are making them out to be. They're a game changer, of course. But that's the point of new content. To change the old by adding new. They fly and shoot and break through stuff. I get it. They started too strong, sure, but big deal! Nearly everything added starts too strong or weak and gets balanced over time. At this point planes are becoming nothing more than an easy rotation and a way to initiate a fight with a slight advantage if used properly. 

To me, planes are very easy to counter. You just build a bit to block shots, side step or jump over the dive bomb, and unload your AR on it until it blows up or they jump out. Then if they fly off you can persue or leave, if they drop on you then fight as if someone launch padded on you. Easy as that. 

In squads it can be a bit more of a pain if you're caught alone by a whole enemy squad on a plane raining shots on you. But if you're with a mildly competent team you can drop a plane before it could even reach your builds with a bit of focused fire. I see so many videos plaguing this subreddit like herpes that show someone barely moving and never taking shots at a plane as it proceeded to smash right into their still body and they complain like nothing could have been done. Just move, and shoot it down!

My whole point of this long rant, is that everyone who has a hard time with new things in the game should first try to adapt, by learning how best to counter whatever they're having trouble with. If something is legitimately an unbalanced problem in the game, it will eventually get fixed or tossed in the vault. 

Beyond that if you're the type that wishes things would all go back to the way they were in earlier seasons.. you need to give up, and play a game that won't change. Maybe counter strike. That's still basically the same game it was a decade or more ago. This game however, is constantly evolving and I don't see it stopping any time soon. So just let that soak in and adapt or leave so this sub can be more than this stream of cancerous entitlement. ",FortNiteBR

So, as a message from the players, don’t lower the skill gap, just add skill-based matchmaking.

 Super new and late to the FortNite bandwagon. I play maybe a few times a week. Wish it was more but kind of busy with being a student, etc. Beat with me amd sorry if this is a stupid question. 

In his newest video with the 21 elims., NINJA is  playing duos with Monstcr. Five people are left, Ninja and Monstcr get into a gun fight with another duo. Ninja gets knocked down but not killed and is waiting to be revived. Monstcr is battling the other duo solo while Ninja is still down. Ninja then presses start ( at least it goes to the start screen, where you can switch your weapons slots, drop items, etc.), not sure what he hits but as soon as he comes back into the game his character stands up and himself and Monstcr get the Victory Royal. 

So my question is, what the hell did Ninja use?  

Like I said, I'm very new to FortNite, but I know that if you get knocked down you can't get up unless you're revived by another teammate. Also I've never seen anyone just be able to win a match while there are four other people, let alone while their teammate is only engaging two, that means a whole other duo was completely eliminated with the click of a button. 
 
This doesn't seem fair at all. While I do enjoy watching Ninja and understand he's one of the many faces of FortNite, I think that's extremely unfair for him to just be able to automatically win games. I mean shoot if I could automatically win I'd probably create a channel as well.

* Kills will not earn you points if you don't capture
* Continuously move clockwise or counterclockwise to capture will ensure victory
* Stay away from the middle unless you're in overtime play

Not everyone is able to pour several hours into the game, meaning many people are indeed “bad” at the game thanks to this. I’ve been playing since Season 2, and I have seen a dramatic increase in skill level from my time playing around 1-3 hours a day. 

Many new players are discouraged from playing as they just can’t compete with all the TTVs and YouTubers who pour 8 hours a day into the game, which is why I believe we need a SBMM or MMR system, or just the long awaited competitive mode. 

Many people say SBMM/MMR will kill the game, but I don’t understand how it would. It would encourage new players, (or just players in general, as I’ve seen many stop playing due to not being able to compete) to play the game more as they are matched with other players their skill level. From what I’ve seen, the MMR system in Overwatch works pretty darn fine, even if it does have some flaws here and there. In my opinion I think this would be much better than a ranked mode, as many people wouldn’t play ranked at all just so they can clap public lobbies to flex with their 20 elims. 

What are your thoughts on this?

I instantly fell in love with it, I then bought the battle pass in season 3 and constantly supported the game. But then came the end of season 5 came around and I stopped playing for a week. Then during season 6 it was half the season, then right now I haven’t ever touched the game since week 3 of season 7. Today I finally decided to delete the game, the game started to get very repetitive and boring. Plus all the additions of weapons started to really bug me, I’ve always hoped there would be an Ltm where it was only season 3 stuff, map, weapons, everything. I just want to go back to a simpler time, where there wasn’t so much toxicity and try hards, they’ve just made the game boring, and the toxicity shows as after deleting it my friends don’t even want to play with me. I’m relieved that I’ve deleted it though, I feel like I’ve really taken a lot of weight off my shoulders, I always stressed about being better than my friends but now after deleting the game I feel a lot less stressed out. I want to say a final goodbye to this game, we had a great time and I wish Epic Games well.

I come home from work and want to have some fun playing Fortnite, but someone with TTV or Youtube in their name completely outskills me in every game.  The skill ceiling in this game is so insanely high, those of us who can't play this game for 8 hours a day end up getting demolished.  At one point I would have considered myself to be ""good"" at this game.  I had a win rate of about 5%, but now it has become agonizing to get to the top 15 and then watch people pull insane build/edit plays against me. At least with other BR games like Blackout and PUBG the average person has a fighting chance against a better player, where in Fortnite it feels like every 1v1 fight is David v Goliath, but David doesn't have a slingshot.

When I drop in with my friends in squads it's not too bad, but if I want to play some solos then I expect to have everyone and their sister in the lobby streaming to 15 people and calling everyone ""bots"" when they kill them.

**Description:** Some sort of event (it's Epic's job to write the story) causes strange anomalous rifts to appear across the island. These anomalies bring in POI's that still exist in other timelines/dimensions - perhaps even appearing in a completely different location. Only one anomaly would be present at a time, and it could rotate weekly or even per match for a season (a bold suggestion). I chose four POI's which were popular among the community to showcase the idea:

*Processing img 1ya9x88mlp921...*

1. Dusty Depot - North of the Villain's Base
2. The Prison - South of Lazy Links
3. Season 1 through 3 Factories - In Dusty Divot where it would have been if the meteor did not hit.
4. Greasy Grove - In the desert in place of the gas station.

These are just a few examples of POIs which could return, I also considered the Soccer Field which was set up for the world cup. I know the shatter effect around the areas could be intrusive for map view, however it was the best I could think of to present this idea. I tried to select areas on the map which felt a little empty and/or would be easy to adjust for this purpose. Let me know what you think. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

But it's so interesting and funny to see how other big streamers act when it comes to him. Tfue is that one kid in high school that EVERYBODY wanna be best friends with. It's funny to see how much other big streamers go outta their way to get Tfue to notice them. They know if they associate themselves with him, and let other people see that they're associated with him, or ""friends"" with him, they'll reap all the benefits of being in Tfue's ""circle"" of Fortnite friends, and yes, the benefit is clout, amongst other things. And just because somebody is a big streamer, doesn't mean they can't be clout chasers, people are greedy man. 

See, if you're seen as a popular person's friend, people and fanboys, are gonna automatically follow you and like you, purely off of that alone, for the most part, because whatever the popular person likes, the fanboys will like, for the most part. I've noticed how streamers go outta their way to be extra nice to Tfue, just so his fans can see that they're ""cool"" with him, and also by them being extra nice, they get on Tfue's ""good side"", so maybe he'll duo with them in the future, or involve them in his squads. I've seen streamers be careful what they say about Tfue, out of fear of probably losing him as a ""connect"". I've noticed how streamers just out right kiss his azz lol. And when i say streamers, i'm talking about big streamers. I've noticed how streamers go outta their way to tweet positive stuff about him, even streamers that's never streamed with him, probably hoping he'll notice them. All of this is just interesting to see how people try to enter Tfue's circle. They want that golden ticket lol.

And with all this being said, Tfue is just a guy who keeps to himself, which is one of the things i like about him. You don't see him try to go outta his way to try to stream with another big streamer, you don't see him try to go outta his way to tweet another streamer, you don't see him go outta his way to try to ""collab"" with another streamer, nothing.

However the only possible way to counter with the same building mechanic is to add a bullet penetration damage. That would make the game in line with other shooters, and lead to less complaint.

I don't have any true qualifications to list in order for you to take my post seriously. I've played this game since the end of season 2, and have about \~250 total wins in thousands of games. I played on PC (with controller) for 8 months, and now I play on Xbox. I place my own skill level at above average for sure, and nowadays I enjoy going for high kill games mainly to try and beat my personal best. Back in the day, I used to casually play all the fun xbox 360 games : Halo, Gears, Cod, etc. Before playing Fortnite I had played League of Legends, but switched to Fortnite because, as probably is the case with most of you, my friends were playing it. I've always been quite good at games, and quickly became fairly decent. My friends and I sucked back in season 3 relative to the average player, yet we could not stop playing. And although we are much much better now, we barely play. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've put in quite a lot of time to this game over the past year, and we've about hit our personal skill cap. We don't have enough time each day nor the desire to to grind hours of this game. We used to play for a couple of hours at a time and probably win at least once. However now, as I said, we barely want to log on. The only reason we play is to 'hangout' with each other doing an activity when we cannot physically be together. 

&amp;#x200B;

We used to play everyday. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then there was Fortnightmares. And if you want to click away from this post now after blowing air out of your nose thinking ""how can this idiot possibly think Fortnightmares is what's wrong with this game."" Then go ahead. However, if you want to hear a story, my story, then I'm going to tell one. But first we need to go back...back to the start. A brief overview of a history of changes. 

&amp;#x200B;

We (when I say we I mean my friends and I) didn't care about the double pump/shotgun nerf, although it was slightly annoying. We didn't care about the nerf to the starting health of walls, although it was slightly annoying. And we didn't even care when they added a P90 that was crafted by the Smithing God Hephaestus himself, although it was again, slightly annoying. All of these were missteps, but we could live with them. It didn't make me want to stop playing. But you know what pissed us the fuck off in the early days? The original guided missile. The jet pack. Items like this had never existed in Fortnite, and they were insufferable to deal with. They were nothing like Fortnite, and they did not belong. The jet pack was removed two patches later, while the guided missile lasted one single patch. The jet pack and guided missile came out before all of the changes I had previously listed. I now realize they were an omen, a preview of the unfortunate things to come. Adding a completely new and unbalanced item/mechanic that had no prior testing would become Epic Games' forte over the coming months.

&amp;#x200B;

There had always been irritating changes, and positive changes. We thought removing bounce pads and adding chillers was awful, while adding rifts was great. We thought shadow stones were questionable at best, while the ATK was surprisingly balanced. However one theme stayed true: Epic was changing the game as much as possible. Why they removed some items, why they added others, is beyond any of the players. They were doing things simply to do it. They took no input from pros or streamers, the people playing the game 10+ hours a day, and added/removed items and mechanics without direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, we still loved it, we played all through the Summer and into the Fall. And we had a great time. Some items came and went, but it was still Fortnite. And then Epic decided to unleash the catastrophe of an event that was Fortnightmares. I noted this as a point of importance earlier, and what follows is why :

 I don't know how I didn't see it coming, or how anyone didn't see it coming. Epic had been telling us it was their game and not the players' for so long. This event was simply them pushing as far as they could, to see how much we would push back. For those that don't know,  this event forced everyone to play a completely distorted mode than was nothing like actual Fortnite and, in my opinion, was the darkest day (literally and figuratively) in the history of Fortnite's existence. There is no way Epic thought people would prefer this mode to the original. We all know it should have been a Limited Time Mode, a Halloween event, but it wasn't. And that's why this was a huge point in time. Epic told you it was their game, and they were going to do with it what they pleased. And, oh yeah, they decided to release the game changing glider redeploy mechanic on the same exact patch. What I logged on to play that day wasn't Fortnite, and I had seen more resentment toward Epic Games than I had ever seen before. The community was irate, and deservedly so. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think things are any better now than they were then, and I don't think we have ever truly recovered. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since Halloween we, players of Fortnite, have been subjected to the grappler, glider redeploy, mounted turret, dynamite, balloons, the infinity sword, planes, and the latest addition, the boom box. I could go into depth about how disruptive each of the items listed here are, but if you can't see for yourself, then this whole post isn't for you anyway. You know whats funny is people were surprised Epic added that sword and planes right before the Winter Royale qualifiers. People were shocked at how Epic could be so foolish. Yet, I thought it was the most predictable thing Epic has done. They can't spell balance, it seems they just want the game to look different. They prioritize CHANGE and NEW, and by God did they give it to you. You pros/gamers who slave away at this game, and were good enough to qualify for the semifinals, they rewarded you with the only way they knew how, by changing the game drastically. A change not one person in that tournament would have agreed to, they implemented on the day of. But its not just about competitive Fortnite, my friends and I despise the recent times. We had dealt with the turrets and glider redeploy and everything else but the planes and the sword infuriated us. And I know the sword did not last long, but its the larger point that it was even in the game in the first place. How could they think it was a good idea? If you did not realize what I realized at Halloween, that they only cared about change, then you now had to know after this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most people like to think what Epic is doing is lowering the skill gap, a point I agree with generally as the game needs to survive and will not survive on 'sweats' alone. You can see it in the items they release. However, I don't think this is Epic's main intention, I just think they have always enjoyed adding game changing items and mechanics. I think whatever data they collect, somehow shows a positive correlation with huge change. Going all the way back to the guided missile in season fucking 3, it always been about change, and never about balance. They removed clingers for what? Who knows. They removed bounce pads for what? Who knows. They added a silenced sniper and scar that are legitimately so similar to guns already in the game for what purpose? Who knows. Why did they remove dual pistols then add them back exactly how they were before being removed? Who knows. 

But I do know - for change. To keep it 'interesting' or 'fresh' as they have been doing all along. 

&amp;#x200B;

Epic, your loyal player base has been drowning in a sea of change. Change without intention or direction. As I write this I barely have a desire to drop onto the map, not because I have moved onto another game or am bored with Fortnite, but because I know the game is bleeding. Because I don't know if I want to invest more time into a game that will continue to anger me with each coming patch notes. At this point I can only assume season 8's headlines will be tanks, invisibility cloaks, and a port a fortress with mounted turrets that flies around the map. Its sad to me that this doesn't even seem that far fetched. 

&amp;#x200B;

People say 'just remove this' or 'just add that' and 'the game will be fine'. The reality is the game will not be fine based on one change. The game is so far removed from what it was, one change will not save it. What do I want from Epic? To slow down and relax. You are driving loyal players away. Bots will still be bots no matter how many boomboxes you give them, you are not helping the game by adding these types of items. The game has evolved to a point where if you're just getting on board now, you are going to be way behind. Adding these items to try to give these players a chance is not a solution. A better solution is separation of players by skill, yet you've shown no desire to implement this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to fix Fortnite, I would leave that to those more qualified than I am. However, I do know that this game deserves better and so do the people playing it.

There are many people looking for MMORPGS and the industry is just not giving them at all.

By MMORPG I don't mean STW (Because some people say that's an MMO), What I mean is character creation, class choosing (warrior, assassin, archer, mage...etc), quests, dungeons, character progression and professions, castle sieges, housing, mounts, factions  and end game content as well as PVP and a vast open world that we could explore until forever.

Epic has shows that they are able to make different type of armors and they do look pretty good especially FORTNITE graphics. (Those wizards with the robe looked amazing, or Taro as assassin etc etc).... 

The PC gaming community has been looking for an MMO for God knows how long... I really think they should start working on one as it'll probably be extremely successful. 

What do y'all think o.o

This could be something such as a hug which is where you literally just hug you teammate. Only 1 person would need the emote for another person to join in to make it more interactive. Enemies can also join in with you to make it that much more enjoyable. Some examples of teammotes could be:
  
• hug: arms would be spread out asif ready to hug somebody. If somebody near you opens the emote screen, if they are close enough then there will be an option to join in with the hug. If nobody joins in the hug within a certain time period then it could do something such as stumble and look down or just put your arms down and continue with life
  
• konga line: LETS ALL DO THE KONGA
  
• handshake: shake hands with another person
  
• secret handshake: like the handshake however with more twists and more complexity (secret handshakes in movies or real life where you make them with your friends etc)

• wheel barrel: like the wheel barrel where one person is on the floor holding themselves up with their hands and one person has hold of their legs whilst running together (same speed as walking, can be done while moving)
  
• high five: literally a high-five

Obviously there are not an infinite amount of possibilities however there are a lot and i feel like this would be a great addition to the game. The emotes would not be too expensive and as i said only one player would need the emote for multiple players to take part. These emotes could also be done with more than 2 teammates, maybe an emote where multiple t-pose in a line whilst holding hands or something like that.

TL:DR emotes which multiple people can join in with. Emotes teammates/enemies can join in with.",FortNiteBR

Searching for gnomes WOULD be a bit harder if we didn't have all the locations posted here in less than an hour from challenges being updated, but I understand that is out of your control.

Visiting more than one place in a single round should have a predetermined route you have to take for it to count, instead of grabbing a plane and flying over the two spots in a matter of 30 seconds.

Damaging players with weapons needs to be in the thousands, not 200. Even grenade/stinky/tnt damage could be bumped to 500 and be finished easily in one respawn LTM.

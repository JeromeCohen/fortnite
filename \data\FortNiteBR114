So this is a culmination of several other theories, which I put together and tweaked to get the full story. Here it is:

Long ago, there were 5 different kingdoms, each master of an element. They lived in peace, but that all changed when the fire kingdom attacked. The fire kingdom, under the command of its powerful king, swept across the different kingdoms and defeated them, until the only one left was the ice kingdom. Thus began the great war, a battle of fire and ice.

Note that during this war, a barbarian outpost of the ice kingdom mysteriously disappeared. We know that this village was actually transported from the past to the present when the rifts connected Space-time at the beginning of S5. This village contained the Viking Skins, as well as Valkyrie and Ragnarok.

In the past, the war raged on. The fire kingdom was winning, so the Ice King led an all out assault. They were able to capture the Fire King and chain him up in the dungeons of Polar Peak, but the Ice King knew he would escape, so he sacrificed himself and his kingdom, covering everything in a deep freeze, permanently freezing everyone in it forever. This cold was too strong for the fire king, and it kept him trapped.

Fast forward to the present. The war is long forgotten, only seen as a myth. However, the place remained a frozen wasteland, only allowing the toughest to survive. One of these people is Sgt. Winter, a brilliant mechanic. He was able to invent the AIM Robots and Biplanes. While exploring, he found the Infinity Blade, which he would use as another source of unlimited energy (he uses the sword in the S7 trailer). When the Kevin events occur on the main island, Sgt. Winter senses it and realizes its a more powerful energy which can be used to help his people. So, using his tech, he literally breaks off some of his land and sails it to the BR island. He then uses his biplanes and his army of Slushie Soldiers to try and invade it. But as we know, the BR island has seen some shit, and they're able to put up a fight. Sgt. Winter's army however is still able to establish ""expedition outposts"".

However, Sgt. Winters moving the land had unexpected consequences. The move to a temperate island increased the surrounding temperature of Polar Peak, slowly reversing the deep freeze put into effect by the Ice King. While the difference isn't too drastic, its still enough for the Fire King to awake and start using his powers to escape his fiery prison. This is why Polar Peak is slowly thawing out. The Ice King awakes too and is surprised, because if he awoke from his frozen slumber he knows the Fire King is returning (hence the name of this week's secret loading screen and its description).

In order to keep the fire king imprisoned, the Ice King uses a piece of Kevin to amplify his powers and cover the island with snow. By doing this, he also creates the ice cube monsters (the leaked Ice King event). He doesn't want to invade the island, it was just caught in the middle. But its too late, the Fire King escapes and starts battling the Ice King. After the battle, the Fire King eventually prevails (the end of the Ice King event will probably coincide with the beginning of week 9, the official release of the snowfall skin and when the dungeon will fully thaw). 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the Fire King heats things up too much. By melting all the ice in the snow areas around Polar Peak, he makes a lot of extra water that floods big chunks of the island. Season 8 will be an underwater themed season, as shown by the multitude of items in the battle pass and released skins which are underwater themed.

&amp;#x200B;

27,JoshTheGamer17,1547827467,ahbx0k,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ahbx0k/serious_question_if_epic_actually_did_make_a/,1,"Serious question: if Epic actually did make a feature where you can finish off Battle Passes of the past (that you purchased), what exactly would the impact be on the game and playerbase?","DISCLAIMER: I’m not saying Epic should make this feature.

I’m just saying, this method could essentially get rid of this ‘OG’ mentality by giving players another shot at getting these rare skins only found in the battle pass. However, it punishes you for not playing in the past seasons by only allowing you to finish battle passes that you purchased (no Renegade Raider or Black Knight for you if you started in Season 3).

But still, since most posts on here mentioning this method are getting hate for it, what exactly would this method start? Would it kill the game darn near instantly? Or would it make more money on Epic’s side (I don’t know, maybe, maybe not)? Remember, you can either purchase tiers or grind for them with weekly and daily challenges while also playing the game XP wise. 

Anyway, that’s my first question. The second one (I didn’t want to make the title too long) is this: if Epic were to implement something like this, what would you prefer the cost be to actually access these past battle passes? After all, they missed out on past seasons/battle pass rewards, remember? Your cost would also have to hold together most of the playerbase, so there’s that. You could make it so that they have to reach Level 100 XP-wise to access ONE battle pass from the past for next season, but that’s probably a dumb idea.

Anyway, just curious to see what you all think.

I don't want to have to play versus amazing players when i'm trying to sit back and relax. When you are being asked to make the game more competitive and listen to your pros ,we don't mean that you have to change every aspect of the game  in order to make it more competitive. The tournaments were an amazing feature to the game and i enjoyed them a lot especially the duos pop up cup where i participated every time , i also play scrim games occasionally so you could say that i have played on a ""high"" level. That being said , i don't want every game to be that competitive because some times i just want to enjoy myself and being matched only versus people of my level if not higher is actually frustrating after a certain point.Although i have been in love with the game ever since mid season 2 where i really got into it this is the first time i actually haven't been enjoying the game at all. Although i sometimes want to play on a competitive level i am for the most part a casual player.

There are rumors of a Skill-based matchmaking system being added to the game and at first i didn't really believe it but i am really starting to think that they have done so after playing about 4 hours on this patch.

Before I accidentally go into more reasons why Fortnite is below average I will give it ONE thing. It has my favorite kind of storytelling, that being teliing you absolutely nothing.

A story exists, it's there, but you're just a bunch of random dudes and dudettes fighting on an island that just so happens to be the hotspot for a bunch of weird magical, paranormal, cosmic anomolies. 80% of the canon is speculation and guesses as to what is happening and why. Epic just throws things at us and it's up to the community to piece together some kind of story from it.

Woah a comet is heading towards the island that's neat. It crashed landed in Dusty Depot and now a weird government base is sectioning the area. The comet shedded and a space capsule is inside I wonder who was in it and why. On top of that there's an evil skull fortress next to Snobby Shores but that could just be the directors making this new super hero movie. I woke up now there's a menacing countdown on my tv screen and a rocket just shot out of the skull fortress jumping through cracks in time or reality but it went crazy now there's a giant crack in the sky. This is weird there's a bunch of rifts all over the island and things are coming through them and things are also showing up IN REAL LIFE! I mean whatever it sort itself out the crack is shrinking but now purple lighting is striking in the dessert and a giant space cube that's moving on its own is running around the island every hour leaving marks and evaporates in the Loot Lake. HOLY SHIT IT CAME OUT OF THE LAKE AND LIFTED THE HOUSE INTO THE SKY NOW THERE'S A PORTAL TO SOMEWHERE IN THE LAKE AND THE CUBE IS TAKING THE ISLAND TO THE DIFFERENT SYMBOLES IT LEFT AND ABSORBING THEM AND CREATING MONSTERS! THE CUBE IS SPLIT THE ISLAND IS GOING NUTS AND EXPLODES AND EVERYONE GOT TRANSPORTED TO A POCKET DIMENSION WHERE WE WITNESSSED THE RIFTS FORMING INTO A BUTTERFLY THAT RESETS THE ALL OF THE PAST DISASTERS! WHAT IS HAPPENING?! Well now that the craziness of the last few months is over we can finally relax. What about a snow storm heading towards the island I'm sure it's fine. Can't top the madness that we've been through. Okay now another island crashed into the island and the corner is a winter wonderland and were being visted by Santa and androids with planes and strange outposts but I mean hey explainable stuff. Okay now so there's a giant ice ball in the sky and we're getting warnings of a massive snow storm. OH BOY HERE WE GO AGAIN!

The back to back story events mixed with small clues as to what is happening and things that are still unexplainable and we still don't know about to this day just blows my mind and get's me hyped to play the game to see what happens next AND THAT'S FUCKING AWESOME TO ME!

Also grapplers take you up 5 stories high and require you to build nothing to contest high ground. 

Bouncers compared to grapplers also give off more audio to figure out where a player is coming from. Players are also much slower when bouncing compared to grappling.

Also if someone puts a bouncer down then that bouncer is available for others to use (teammates or enemies). A grappler is suited better for solos.

&amp;#x200B;

So as the title says, I have trouble with that weekly challenge that says deal damage with 5 different weapons in one match. Since I could not do it on the standard modes, I tried Team Rumble. But it seems I'm always stuck at 4 out of 5. I usually find 5 different weapons and then try find opponents to hit. But last time I tried, I actually did it (or I think I did) but I was still stuck at 4 out of 5. I had a golden AR, a blue SMG, a purple minigun, a green hunting riffle and a green pump shotgun. At first I hit a guy with the AR and the SMG but it showed 1 out of 5. Then I used the other 3 and I was stuck at 4 again. Tried to hit again with the AR and the SMG, still no 5/5. Then I searched for another weapon, managed to find a Combat SMG, I hit a guy, still 4/5. Which seems logical, if I hit a guy with an SMG it makes sense it won't count the combat one as well. But still.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure that most likely I'm doing something wrong, I'm not saying it's a bug necessarily, but idk what it is. It's the only challenge from that week that I have left and it gives 10 battle stars, a whole tier on the battle pass, so I definitely want to do it. Any suggestions?",FortNiteBR

***

If you've been browsing this sub recently, you've probably seen the recent increase in complaints that shields are becoming rarer. The idea is that Epic has been adding so many items recently that the size of the consumable loot pool has increased significantly, causing shield drop rates to decrease as the chance of getting other consumables increases.

However, everything I've seen about this is anecdotal (stuff like _""I went 3 games yesterday and I didn't find any!""_). And since [Fortnite DB](https://db.fortnitetracker.com/) doesn't seem to show data from previous versions of the game (and the Wayback Machine [hasn't really been helpful](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://db.fortnitetracker.com/loot/chest)), it's difficult to find good data on whether or not, and if so to what extent, this is actually true.

Let's set aside the question about whether or not these item additions have been good for the game. I'm _not_ trying to make a statement about the glider redeploy item or anything like that. I'm simply trying to answer the following question:

**Have shield drops from chests actually become more rare due to Epic's recent item additions?**

First, we need to find some actual data from previous versions of the game. Luckily, [Google's cached version](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:xB08F6CpuAQJ:https://db.fortnitetracker.com/loot/chest) of Fortnite DB's chest loot page seems to still have data from **v7.00**. (If Google updates their cache, here's a [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/XEnriTt.png) of the cache, and here's a [direct archive](http://archive.fo/W1yIb) of the text-only version of the page.)

For comparison, here's the [current data](https://db.fortnitetracker.com/loot/chest) for chest drop rates.

What does it show us? Here's a direct comparison of the chest loot data from v7.00 to v7.20:

- large shield potions decreased from 18.6% to 14.7%

- small shield potions decreased from 12.4% to 9.8%

- slurp juice decreased from 5.0% to 3.9%

- chug jugs decreased from 2.1% to 1.7%

Overall, just since the start of season 7, the chance of getting a shield-giving item from a chest has gone down from **38.1%** to **30.1%**.

That's a drop of about **21 percent** (not to be confused with [percentage points](https://xkcd.com/985/)).

That's absolutely a significant drop, especially if _(__**read:**__ big if, since I don't actually have the data to support it; if anyone has data from previous versions of the game I'd love to see it)_ it's just one step in a trend of shield chances steadily going down as more items are added to the pool.

I'm not going to try to make a statement about what exactly should be done about this. For one thing, it'd be pretty easy to fix the problem by simply bumping up the drop rates for shields (and lower the rates for everything else) without actually removing anything. I'm simply trying to show that, _yes_, recent additions to the item pool have caused shield drop rates from chests to go down.

Again, if anyone else knows where I can find loot data from other versions of the game, I'd love to look at it to actually see if shields getting rarer going down has been a major long-term issue in the game. Even so, this is pretty good evidence that shield drop rates can and do go down when more items are added to the game.",FortNiteBR

Advice I've gotten so far: Watch youtube, practice building in playground &amp; creative, play 1v1, be aggressive, hot drop, and just play to get better. The advice to delete my kids -- not gonna happen but lol.

My previous post:

Not gonna lie, this post inspired me.

https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/agyzan/i_35f_am_trying_to_learn_super_smash_while_my/

I downloaded Fortnite on my laptop so I can play with my 11 &amp; 8 year old sons. When I play with them, I only seem to follow them around until I die.

I've tried logging in and playing while they're at school, but I suck and die almost instantly.

I used to play Doom, Quake, Castle Wolfenstein, Counterstrike, etc. back in the day, but this feels like night and day. I just want to be good enough to not be such a tool playing with my kids.

I play like 30 minutes to an hour a day, usually on my lunch break. I can probably sneak in some games after everyone's in bed. I just can't spend hours upon hours playing every day like I could before kids.

Any tips on how to get better? Thanks!

Edit: Aiming I'm okay at I guess; got my first kill tonight! Building stuff baffles me. Game is super fast but I figure I'll get used to it.

First of all I'm hoping and praying that they either make it a strict Limited Time Mode or they seperate it it completely from the normal playlists, making NORMAL solos/duos/squads still available during the event

Second of all I can't believe Epic is going to be attempting this once again after the first time was a relative disaster. In my mind it seemed as though the majority of the community was absolutely tired of it by the time it started to wind down

Third of all aside from the fact that Epic is probably going to be releasing this event in the near future, I absolutely cannot believe that they're going to be doing this only a few months after Fortnitemares. The Halloween event was less than 3 months ago. They aren't even giving people the time to forget about the disgrace that was Fortnitemares

Look, I understand that the majority of the playerbase is casual and people that don't really give a fuck about the direction of Fortnite. But in my mind things like Fortnitemares will drive players away. I know for damn sure when Fortnitemares was going on I was completely disinterested from the game. 

I genuinly feel like the only people who enjoyed Fortnitemares were complete casual players and little kids 12 and under, or both. 

I hope Epic doesn't make the same mistake twice. I'm really PRAYING that if they do fo through with this Ice Storm event, that they'll make it a seperate playlist or an LTM. There's no reason to integrate that kind of stuff into the normal game in my opinion",FortNiteBR

https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/agyzan/i_35f_am_trying_to_learn_super_smash_while_my/

I downloaded Fortnite on my laptop so I can play with my 11 &amp; 8 year old sons. When I play with them, I only seem to follow them around until I die. 

I've tried logging in and playing while they're at school, but I suck and die almost instantly.

I used to play Doom, Quake, Castle Wolfenstein, Counterstrike, etc. back in the day, but this feels like night and day. I just want to be good enough to not be such a tool playing with my kids.

I play like 30 minutes to an hour a day, usually on my lunch break. I can probably sneak in some games after everyone's in bed. I just can't spend hours upon hours playing every day like I could before kids.

Any tips on how to get better? Thanks!",FortNiteBR

The Ice king entrapped the The Fire King then had the Fire King's volcano base buried under loot lake so no one would later remember who the Fire King was. Because of what ever happened between them which ill get back to later. Once the Fire King escapes he will destroy polar peek as revenge and bring his volcano base back probably as the new polar peek. I also think the dragon eggs was once owned by the Fire King but the Ice King stole the eggs because they held power,value or something along the lines of that. And i think that when the eggs get close to the Fire King they'll probably hatch because they respond to the heat that the Fire King emits.

On the other hand the amount of glitches or whatever, that's allowing multiple players to get underneath the map, making it impossible to kill them(without the use of rifts like that other user on this sub did).

With SBMM and MMR, you would get matched with players around your skill level. This would solve many problems I see many people talk about. It would allow for much more fair but still challenging matches to players who aren’t as good as skilled players. Newer players wouldn’t be as discouraged to play the game as they are now, as at the moment new players are getting clapped as they don’t know how to play nor improve much. I’ve introduced many of my friends/seen many people try the game out and say “wow this game isn’t fun, no thanks”. 

The introduction of SBMM would benefit a lot of the community, and I think it would be a good idea to add it to the game!",FortNiteBR

The SS1 bot has been officially replaced due to a few issues with missing images... We have a new /u/JohnWickBot which has been posting the shop successfully for the past few days and we shouldn't have many issues with missing images anymore.  Going forward we will be allowing only this bot to post shop images.

We want to ensure, as we are almost to 1 million subs, that we are doing everything that is best for the sub and you the user.

-People will know if you an actual streamer and not someone who's just in streamer mode which no longer allows us to see the username

-Looks cool

-Can allow some to add you so you can form a stream community which is uniting gamers

-Someone can still have streamer mode on, but it would add an Icon next to it.

-Gets rid of having to use TTV, Mixer, or Yt in ones username



CONS:
-Might take up too much space if you're in a squad game with a big HUD. (HUD scale can still be toggled so its smaller)

If they would ever re-release the challenges, they also could (and should imo) older battlepass items. I dont think (and i hope) that this wont happen. People who have the final Omega really put much time into the game and they shouldnt be disregarded, just because you couldnt complete this.

The Omega challenges coming back is comparable to allow people who played during season 2 to obtain the season 2 battle pass. This would be absolutely dumb and wouldnt make any sense.

My suggestion?

Bandages and med kit are grey and blue respectively. Bandage spawn is guaranteed to get you to the threshold of 75 hp (5x15) so why not have minis at grey, but lower the amount per spawn to 2. In turn, also lower the rarity of big pot to green.

If you want to keep your fanbase fix this and numerous other issues. PS. Before you all go, network this and network that. There was no flux in my network at the time of this altercation. This isn't an unknown issue this game has imo the worst hit detection in the industry. You are an 8 billion dollar company who created a game that's worth 2.5 million get your shit together.

But only to 100 HP of health. Not shield. Shield is extra health. I feel like shield should be special and getting a kill shouldn't give you shield. Also this would basically reward good players a little too much. We need a skill gap but not to the point where good players get better and the bots don't have a chance to progress throughout a game. That isn't good for the game at all. If we had Skill based matchmaking, that would be fair. Also, vaulting minis and increasing slurp spawn rate would be good for the game as well. Especially since you can only carry 6 minis now, it would be better to have slurps instead of med kits and minis. Basically a gauraunteed slurp in every chest would be perfect. This would make it so that most of the time people are at around the same health and nobody is stuck in a 1v1 with 30 Health and 10 shield while the other person has been camping the whole time is at 200 health. 


TLDR; vault minis, instead put a slurp in every chest, every kill has med kit effect. Replenish health but not shield. ",FortNiteBR

 We don't need any more weapons or items. At the end of season 3 fortnite was at its best because, nothing was op to a point where there was no counters, building was a good defense, the weapons were good and we didn't have un needed weapons like a scoped pistol. On that, the weapons being added are overly un needed. We never wanted a suppressed sniper or scoped pistol.
2. Mobility
The mobility in the game now is dumb, not to mention we don't need mobiliy items (excluding launch pads). We begged for mobility items because some people would not pay any attention to the storm, and we got shopping carts. Shopping carts were not a bad addition but not a good one either. Now we have planes and quadcrashers which are stupidly hard to counter when coming at you, because they destroy your build. Items like ballons and the grappler are useful but not needed. Bounce pads (original) were awesome and so was the recent bounce pad but, despite the use they provide they got vaulted. Lastly ziplines were a mistake because they were the buggiest things to ever be im fortnite without being vaulted.
3. The map
I do not like the map, the snow section makes it impossible to see my reticle, the desert section makes it overly difficult to see one of my team mates. I find the map to be far to big and the original map to be the perfect size. The locations in the map seem to barely spawn guns on the floor and have a stupid amout of chest(too much or too little). Ex: tilted towers spawns like 36 chest that is stupid.
4. Challenges
The challenges are stupid because of stage challenges, let me explain.
You can only do 1 stage of a stage challenge at a time, and there is your problem. If you could do multiple stages of a challenge in 1 match this wouldn't be there.
5. The bugs
Now fortnite is pretty good with the bugs, end of discussion.
6. In games settings
Can console have the exact same settings as pc. I like to shoot at long ranges, so if i could put my render distance at max and put my effects to the lowest i would be able to do better at long rang combat. That's all for that part of that section. In game settings to change the colour of your reticle would be awesome because as i said earlier, it is really difficult to see my reticle in the snow biome, but if i could change the colour that problem would be gone.
That was it, tell me your thoughts i'd lovs to hear what you have to say.",FortNiteBR

For mobility there are right now: Planes, ziplines, quadcrashers, atks, shopping carts, rifts, rift to go, balloons, gliders, (grappler and launchpad).

Its way too much and planes are just too easy and too fast. They should not do any damage and there should be high risk using those. Atks and shopping carts are useless in this storm is not any kind of threat meta.

What comes to third partying, every player right now knows how easy it clean up the kills. It will be a thing always in br game but in it current state i think its horrible for casuals and better player both. With all this mobility there are third party after third party and whole game feels like one big cluster all the time. After first circle there are so few people left that makes games so boring.

Now with redeploy its ridicolous how easy its go for clean ups for other fights.

This is Fortnite, a game where u have the ability to build but every patch Epic releases a new item to conter more and more building. I know that it will help new players but it is the wrong idea. I'm not a great player at all. I mostly play to get kills and have fun so I dont have that much wins. But there rockets is the only thing that really tilts me. You need 0 aim to use it and here is what happen: Or u destroy tons of ur opponent builds or u deal 130 damage to him. It is a win - win situation. When you miss a shot with ur shotgun, AR and others u are losing potencial damage and not destroying builds at all, but with rockets (Grandade launcher / Quad Launcher) u are always getting something out of it.

But this is still one of the worst ways to play Fortnite. I am aware this is a port of the mobile version most likely because of space constraints. But this port runs at 30 FPS with consistent frame drops if you do so much as attempt to build fight someone. Your game will drop so many frames and you’ll get sent back to the lobby for free because you simply cannot compete since you’re at a disadvantage. PC players, forget about them, them building right in front of you will lag your game out so hard you can’t even react. Its very frustrating to deal with this issue just because if poor optimization and performance. Please either optimize the game for a 60 FPS option or just port the PC version. Micro SD cards are very cheap I don’t think most people would mind a bigger file size and updates if it meant the game was actually playable.

I’m not complaining but attempting to objectively discuss what is happening with the state of the game.  Some of my friends and I compiled a small list of reasons we Ar enjoy enjoying the game at the moment.

1.  Too many weapons/items:  This was fine every once in a while but now it’s becoming over saturated. 

2.  Low quality loot:  Been noticing a lot more grey pistols and SMGs everywhere.  It may just be us but it’s very rare to find blue, purple or gold weapons.

3.  Bugs:  Bullets hitting players after a wall is built;  zip line explosion glitch; sniping over stairs glitch; delayed reaction of damage taken from bullets; anymore I missed?  

4.  Accuracy inconsistency:  Yes yes we’ve all heard the bloom complaint but I feel like lately the inconsistency of aiming has been very bad.  From assault to smg, some games they laser people others they hit one out of every five bullets.  

I’m running short on time but I would like to hear what everyone else thinks.  Is there anything you guys want fixed or changed to improve the game this season?

On one side we have the people that play the game competitively, enjoy playing the game for the skill gap and out playing people. These people hate seeing the game then into a gimmick fest with items designed to counted the core mechanic of the game. They are horrendously toxic to the casual community, disregarding every opinion they have because they want to play the game in a different way to them. 

The casual side is no better, however, as they are just as bad at not understanding people want to actually try in the game. They think that the game should just be played for a bit of laugh, and not taken seriously or played as an esport. They harass people for playing on stretched, or for using certain skins, or for ""tryharding"". This is the one thing I have never seen in any other community, people actually being mocked for trying to get better at the game!?!?!

 There are people who are in the middle who don't attack either side, but their voices get silenced. This is why the game is in the state it is, because epic doesn't know who to listen to as we just shout at each other the whole time, and rarely can agree on anything. This causes epic to make changes they think people will like because one group has said they want that thing, but the other half then hates that change, most recent example being edit sensitivity. 

The community needs to realise there's more than one way to enjoy a game, and you should be able to listen to other people's opinions and respect them, even if you don't share them. Any way that's my little rant over, just hate seeing this community tear itself apart.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is a game of strategy where every choice you make matters. Go left and you’ll find a golden scar. Go right and you get one pumped in the balls. Having the glider take up a slot makes perfect sense. You have to choose if having that mobility is worth sacrificing some heals or a third weapon. This is a perfect risk/reward decision you have to make each game. 

Having a limited number of redeploys also brings VARIETY to the game. You don’t know if the enemies you are encountering from 150m are going to engage in a long-range battle or if you better fortify and prepare for sudden close-quarters combat. This forces you to be a better all-around player and to plan battles strategically rather than speeding through the map ferociously looking for a head to one-pump. 

Would love to hear your thoughts.

However, currently, I believe that there are too many items available in the game. 

One way to address this issue may be spawn rates, however, that introduces RNG that favours those who receive the items from chests. 

My suggestion is that when a new item is added to the game, an old item should be simultaneously vaulted. Preferably this item should be a part of the same category.

For example, with the scoped pistol to the game, the scoped AR can be vaulted. With the addition of gliders, balloons can be vaulted. These items don't need to be vaulted permanently but can be rotated in and out of the games to keep the ""fresh meta"" feeling epic is going for.

It's not a matter of ""just get better""...

-You can't compete with a controller and be as accurate or build as fast against someone on keyboard.  
-And you certainly can't compete against people running scripts with a bunch of options that you don't even have.

There is always something to improve upon, and mastering each new thing is super rewarding and makes you a better player overall. So my question is: why do most people think being a sweat/try hard is bad, and why don’t people want to be associated with them?

I’ve seen this quite a bit, and it just boggles my mind why someone would put themselves or others down for being better than most average players, it’s just plain weird. I realize there’s a more casual player base as well, and I think there should be SBMM lobbies for those people, but generally speaking it’s not bad to be good at the game, or try your best each game you play. Now I realize not everyone is saying this in a negative light, but there are some who will immediately be like “dUdE wHaT a SwEaT!1!1!” after someone outplays them, instead of appreciating their skill.

I feel like the words “sweat” or “try hard” are not the best terms for these players, because it makes people feel secure in being bad at the game because they can just use said words to brush off any mistakes they made. I just think the majority of the casual player base has a stigma against these players, and instead of improving, they just call them “sweaty virgin try-hard”s.

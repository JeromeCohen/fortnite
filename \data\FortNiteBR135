- Remove chests
- Other items can be placed in different spots on the map, instead of commonly placed weapons
- Give every player same shotgun
- Leave sniper rifles spawning for 420 kills
- I'm not sure if it is possible, but it would be fun, if instead of building usual structures (walls h/v, roofs) we could place place towers of wood. 
- Don't let players kill me when I'm sliding without weapons and using the Snoop Dogg dance

I found this LTM very fun and I think it have so much more potential, I feel like I play different game. And it is super fast-paced. If you spam grappler by cd on the roofs and structures game transformes into Spider-Man :D And if feels like quake :0

A month ago solos were completely different, i would have 1, maybe 2 build battles each game.

Now as soon as you encounter someone at mid-short range, they build a 5 story hotel with WiFi and Kitchen.

Did everyone just get a good gaming chair?

&amp;#x200B;

Im not the best builder, but im ok. I definetly have room to improve, but knowing im going to get boxed in in .5 seconds and just die either way really makes my motivation to even hit play go away. I just dont find solo fun when i know every single encounter in mid/late game will turn into a build fight.

(inb4 ""get good"" comments start dropping in. I am average at the game i 100% admit to that, im just wondering why literally every single player wants to turn every fight into a build battle now.)

You can use the edge of pyramids as an extra boost upwards instead of attempting to use stairs.

You can also use the edge of pyramids to have a vertical boost, just jump and place a pyramid below you and off you go!

I think there‚Äôs no point to a knock system if you don‚Äôt get resurrected when the battle ends and your team wins.
Here are my  suggestions:
1) We count knocks instead of kills to the K/D. 
This stops those who think they won‚Äôt win the fight and to help their K/D would finish. To prevent exploits maybe a team is limited to getting only one knock counted on any other player.
2) When you are knocked you drop your loot instead of when you die. This prevents those who finish a knock when they need the loot the other player has. 
3) Lastly, when you are knocked you get a blurry vision so you can‚Äôt give your team intel. This might make it very boring so maybe you see through your teammates eyes for that time. 
4) lastly, since now there‚Äôs no reason to finish a knock, we don‚Äôt allow people to do that. A person can only die out with the regular bleed out time. 

I think this will greatly improve the game since now when your team wins the fight you get a second chance to help them, just like the knock system was intended to do.

A personal Story.,"I always play the LTMs. My faves are Disco and Team Rumble. Yea, the two modes you respawn in. But ever since season 3 when I first ever played Fortnite I've always been an LTM player. 50 v 50 was what got me into Fortnite. You would assume that being an LTM only player would make me trash, right? Well over that last two days to do my daily objectives I played solo, only 2 games of solo. But I won both with 4 and 5 kills respectfully. Not high kills but I landed in low population places like Lucky and Shifty. Maybe i'm a better player than I give myself credit for. Currently I have 18 wins overall. 5 solo, 2 duo and 11 squads.

https://i.redd.it/4c4uyjz8vt521.png

Heyo! I've designed this skin so it could be matched with the 'Bottom Feeder' pickaxe.

&amp;#x200B;

**-SKIN-**

Abyss Dweller roams on the deep abyss of the ocean floor. The skin is based on an old styled diving suit, the lower arms of the suit are made out of glass and are filled with a yellow glowing liquid. On the helmet is a mark of a shark bite and a couple of dents.

&amp;#x200B;

**-BACKBLING-**

The backbling is a trophy claimed by Abyss Dweller in a fight against her nemesis, a big shark who lives in the abyss (Chomp Sr. perhaps?). This item has jigglebones.

&amp;#x200B;

**-GLIDER-**

The glider is an octopus whose tentacles have been knotted together. Upon deployment the octopus appears out of a cloud of ink.

It seems like every time I get rekt in fortnite I get thirsted pretty quickly. And I almost always play duos or squads so I‚Äôm always left just watching my teammates after my death. Which is okay, but I‚Äôd much rather be playing still. I was thinking epic could add in a defibrillator type item that would go in your trap section, with a relatively low drop rate that would instantly revive a knocked player. 

Not only would this make everyone in a squad feel safer, I think it would make for some pretty cool rescue clips. Especially when your teammate is knocked in the storm and you don‚Äôt have time for a full res. You can just run to them, shock them and instantly revive. 

Don‚Äôt know if anyone will actually see this post, but it‚Äôs worth a shot. Let me know what you guys think. 

Also I was thinking this could be a legendary type trap item which would hopefully lower the drop rate of turrets... ",FortNiteBR

Here's Why.,"Turner ""Tfue"" Tenney has been at the top of Twitch for a few months now. His follower count is growing by the most than any other Twitch channel. But he cheated his way to the top.

1. Discrimination against bIacks

1.b. Turner ""Tfue"" Tenney has shown on multiple occasions, his hatred toward the African American community. On several occasions, he has used the raciaI sIur ""co*n"". He was not punished for any of those times.

2. Taking advantage of his ""success""

2.b. Turner ""Tfue"" Tenney has won multiple tournaments but has yet to show any proof of any sort of insider information. There are rumors that multiple people located near the tournament sites gave him info on where the players were, and other things that aren't known.

3. Terrible language

3.b. Turner ""Tfue"" Tenney uses terrible language with and against various groups of people. He mostly shows his true self around other races. He uses words such as ""pus*y"" and ""bi*ch* around bIacks, especially.

4. Removing Ninja from the top of Twitch

4.b. It's quite obvious that Turner ""Tfue"" Tenney considers himself the best Fortnite Battle Royale player. Well, he's not. And he's taking advantage of his fanbase by making them blame Ninja for various things such as how the game is being developed.

First I wanna tell everyone I dont own the skins I'm gonna talk about except for the rogue agent.

It's the time again where epic released a skin people called OG.
P.s. the rogue agent wasnt OG just to clarify that.

But why does epic keep releasing skins some players dont want re-released. 
I honestly thought so called OG's would of received the burned versions of the cookie skins.
Just like they got the purple skulltrooper. 
And they also didn't release the ghoultrooper so what's up with that.

Honestly I dont understand why epic keeps releasing stuff which a part of the community will be upset about.

Clearly a chunk of this community want skins to be rare just to showoff howlong they've played the game.
And we all know battlepass skins aren't gonna cut it.

So my question to all of you guys, would it hurt us (Not OG players) if they kept skins rare for those so called OG players?

Thank you for letting me waste your time.

Usually when I got destroyed by someone I knew if they were a better player and outplayed me, but anymore it‚Äôs just constant bullshit.

There‚Äôs so many splodes in the lootpool where every fight is just boom boom boom, nukes going off everywhere, and not fun to play against.

Planes are ramming through builds 3rd partying nonstop

Constant FPS drops and bugs

Everyone and their grandma is just holding down left click with a smg



I think I‚Äôve finally hit the point that nearly all my friends hit earlier on where this game isn‚Äôt even fun anymore.

Never do I die anymore cause someone did a nasty edit play on me and outbuilt me, I die cause some dickhead with stink bombs, dynamite, and a grenade launcher is just endlessly spamming them while his teammate rams a plane

This isn‚Äôt even fortnite anymore, it almost seems like they‚Äôre trying too hard to please everyone and constantly adding things that really don‚Äôt have a purpose in what FortNite was at its core, and then vaulting shit people loved in order to make room for it when no one had a issue with what was vaulted for the most part

However, this won't solve fortnite's biggest problem right now: sweaty tryhards who the majority of players don't stand a chance against. My solution to this is simple: add a mode where not only season 2 map and weapons are included, but everyone's controller layout is set to old school. Switching weapons will be harder, and building will be near impossible. Also, set everyone's sensitivity to 7 or 8, to make it harder for people who have gotten used to other sensitivities to hit shots at close range. This would probably be Epic's best bet at recreating the old days when everyone was bad. Also, it would be much more welcoming to new players, as the skill gap between them and tryhards would be drastically reduced, making fights more fair.

What I have been seeing a lot of recently is not constructive criticism but rather entitled rants about why something should be brought into the game.  A good example of this is on every one of Epic's tweets thousands of people are always commenting ""like for this skin"", ""bring back this ltm the current one is trash!"" or numerous other comments in a similar vein. WE NEED TO STOP! If we continue with this incessant barrage of requests like bring back the Tac Smg (one of the top posts of today) the more important issues in the game get glossed over and to top it all off it makes Epic more and more likely to ignore the community.

we have to stop being toxic and constantly asking Epic to change the game or bring things back and rather we need to focus on important issues like performance etc... If we do not change Epic will stop listening ",FortNiteBR

I'm not exactly tryhardy myself but I feel like it's unfair to penalise someone, saying they ""ruin the game"" because they're skilled.

An example, this sub despises streamers who put twitch or TTV in their name. Most streamers put TTV in their name for recognition: Fortnite is extremely saturated as it is on twitch, any form of advertising helps and it does correlate to views. The streamer btw was admittedly funny and I am guilty of BM streamers myself, but it's getting somewhat tedious and annoying now.

Secondly, labelling stretched res players as ""tryhards"" or hating makes no sense as its baseless. Stretched res only has positives (excluding making the game look not-so-pleasant admittedly) and a lot of people use it for performance as well (it definitely helped my frames A LOT). I understand it looks like shit, but how does it affect you?

So in short, play as you wish: there will always be skillgaps and competitve players in any videogame, as well as the twitch streamers. Jokes are jokes: I mock streamers myself sometimes but only in light heart and without hostility. Be nice to each other :D

Its either with AR'S and SMG'S, or RPG'S and Nade Launchers. God don't get me started with the Launchers in Squads. If one guy has one, chances are the rest of them will have one too. Now don't get me wrong, currently there is no way to fix this since we would have to change the entirety of the game to do this. But I do feel that since those building nerfs, Squads is a nightmare.

It‚Äôs a real challenge and I enjoy every second of it.     I‚Äôm writing this because, it‚Äôs the most fun I‚Äôve had with my friends ever since Season 7 was released. The pure anarchy and chaos that forms when running from the storm with your friends, not knowing where to go is so fun and thrilling. I know it has been said for every LTM, however I would usually get bored after an hour or two with other LTMs. I was at a point where I really didn‚Äôt care about this game anymore and was always on the brink of quitting. However, this had brought enjoyment that I wasn‚Äôt getting playing the standard game mode. It wasn‚Äôt any new weapon, balance change or map change. It was a simple concept, but it was so refreshing. It felt like logging into the game right after the meteor crashed back in Season 4. With a few adjustments, this LTM could be even better.

This seemingly happens in almost every single match. It does not even matter if you aren‚Äôt built above three stories (build wise), if you take any form of high ground (hills, mountains, buildings), all a player has to do is hold the left trigger forward and press the boost button and you likely will get a kill. 

I know there are some ways to attempt to counter this, by not even stepping foot on higher ground, or attempting to dodge the planes, however, if you are in a fight with another player or multiple players, it‚Äôs seemingly impossible to counter planes unless you are turtling and playing the low ground. I hate to sound like a broken record but I strongly feel that a player shouldn‚Äôt be able to kamikaze into another players builds without any form of risk associated with it.

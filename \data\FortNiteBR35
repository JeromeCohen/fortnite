The Bouncer - The bouncer is not that usefull.
The Tactical Smg and The Drum Gun - These are overpowerd, a lot of players want one of them back but hear me out, if one of them is coming back, epic will have to nerf it and it will not be as it was before.

Dataminers have discovered that once all of the runes at Loot Lake are activated, players will be transported to the Nexus to vote to unvault old weapons. 

So there are 6 possible items that could possibly be unvaulted

\- Drum Gun

\- Tac SMG

\- Bouncers

\- Planes

\- Grapper

\- Infinity Blade   


I've seen many players wanting the drum gun / Tac SMG back, but why?  


We already have 2 balanced SMG weapons. I don't think there is a need for another one. The only item I feel strongly wanted to stay vaulted is the drum gun, which conveniently seems the most popular option everyone wants. In my opinion the drum gun is extremely overpowered especially when it can be used as a SMG as well as an AR and with its 50 bullet magazine size. Players will non stop W key, where's the skill?  


In my opinion every one of you should VOTE for BOUNCERS back! Bouncers were added half way through season 4 and removed at the beginning of season 6. Bouncers was one of the greatest edition that was added to the game! They were skillful in some ways and a very fair item ESPECIALLY considering they were traps. They could be used to avoid fall damage, provide some mobility or escape and unwanted combat.

(according to leaks) !Spoilers!","I'm on mobile, so excuse the inevitable mistakes I'll make.

S1: no story line.



S2: nothin.  


S3: now in this season we saw a massive comet appear in the sky, which ended up crashing into dusty Depot creating dusty divot.

S4: The meteor made dusty divot, the hop rocks are the remnants of the fragmented meteor, the main meteor is actually just a collection of rocks around an escape pod, which h holds the visitor. The season event was the rocket launch, the rocket stored in Omega Mountain blasted off with the help of the visitor's tweaks and created multiple rifts around the map, and created a ""permanent"" one above loot lake.

S5: slowest season ever... But let's get something straight, according to StW, the rifts are just reality distortions. I'm not talking about the Alpha Rifts in StW, I'm talking about the BETA Rifts, the ones that cause reality distortions. I think moisty mire is still intact, but is masked by the rift activity caused by the rocket. (One rift opened right above moisty.)

 The cube is the storm, let's get that straight too. It's a long explanation as to why but just look up ""Storm King boss fight"" on YT and you'll find it. The main rift was corrupted by the storm and it shrunk, concentrating the energy.l, onto a small mountain in the ""fake"" desert. In not sure why the cube spawned on that mountain though, I wish I knew. The cube rolled to loot lake, where the bunker is right now. And THANOS LAKE happened so yeah.

S6: The cube made the middle of loot lake rise up into a giant floating island. Oh yeah, the cube also printed runes around the map, hotspots of storm energy. Those runes turned into corrupted areas, which resemble the arena that you fight the storm king in in StW. So cube went around to the runes, got energy, then went back to loot lake and made a portal in the sky, it kinda looked like the storm... The fortnitemares trailer further confirms my suspicions, it show the portal linked to the storm, shooting energy into the storm.  

So zombies happened, im not going to try remember those times...... 

So the cube proceeds to crack, then explode, here's where I think what's goibg on now Links with this.

When the cube went boom, it broke the bunker, sucking everyone into Nexus. But since we weren't supposed to be there since the runes weren't involved in the opening, it teleported us to the butterfly area, where the butterfly came and touched us while playing old rocket sound effects and weird creepy music... And so it spat us out and the controller of Nexus fixed loot lake into the better loot lake.


S7: playing the skip card on this.


S8: fast forward to where we are now, tell runes are plugged in, the volcano won't stop doing the juul pods, and there's a huge timer in the lake.... I don't know what's happening next, but I'll update this thread once the event happens to try and line everything up...",FortNiteBR

I remember loot lake, that little house in the middle of water. I could almost always win the fights there. Now there's a spaceship?

Wailing Woods was a great place, but now it's that awful jungle biome. Full of unhelpful hills and cliffs, stupid vents, a volcano, etc.

They killed Greasy Grove to make way for a frozen lake and a castle.

And can we just not talk about the desert biome?

The old fortnite map was beautiful. Simple wooden houses, abandoned and falling down. Green hills and fields. A lake, with a pretty little island on it.

Now it's volcanoes, cities, gothic castles, viking villages and airstrips. The whole map is covered in ugly ziplines, and three corners of the map are ruined with the different biomes. Epic said years ago that they were working on adding other maps to the game. That is where these things belong.

It's almost impossible now to get that classic battle royale kind of feel from anywhere in the map.

Just look at [this](https://icdn4.digitaltrends.com/image/fortnite-review-15335-640x640.jpg) and [this](https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/fortnite-battle-royale-140800-5579034.jpg) compared to [this](https://icdn9.digitaltrends.com/image/swap-and-pirate-ship-fortnite-season-8-patch-8-0-7128-640x640.jpg)

And that's just the map. I hate how common all the different ways of getting shields are now. It no longer feels like getting a shield is something extra. It feels like you drop in at half health, and need to quickly find the blue half.

I hate grapplers, and flintnock pistols, and heavy assault rifles. I missed the burst rifle and the revolver. I miss the og weapons. I miss everyone being a default skin, because it felt like we were soldiers.

If epic doesn't at least release a season 1 map before I get completely bored of this game, I might stop playing forever.

This game doesn't feel like it once did, and I don't think I'm the only one that feels this way.",FortNiteBR

Why retail and tilted. These are literally the two most popular locations on the map and are both loved locations by almost everyone.

Locations like Greasy, Anarchy, Factories and Risky were all great locations that were heavily dropped and loved by many.

Traps take no skill to use and it’s very aggravating when someone who is fucking up all their shots can just easily place down a trap with the click of a button and boom, you’re back to the lobby. The purple heavy sniper does the same amount of damage, and actually takes calculation to measure the height and distance at where and when to shoot. THAT should be rewarding. 

Something that is easily put down in the click of a button and does an instant 150 damage is beyond me.

And yes, you can easily counter it by simply walking as far as possible away in the opposite direction of the trap. But now, at that point, you’re stuck in an awkward position with no room to jump around or move around very much, which leads to getting one pumped. There’s no way around it!

If it did 100 damage, I wouldn’t be bothered by that. But a majority of players in a match are at 150 HP/Shield, and the fact that a green rarity trap with, essentially “aimbot”, can take that away in a matter of seconds is just beyond me.

Go ahead, toxic subreddit, go ahead and insult me by calling me a “noob” and what not. I don’t give any less fucks.",FortNiteBR

Like, what the fuck? Saying that the villain team as Thanos as a weapon is also retarded because he’s barely usable and every player in the god damn lobby attacks him at once. 

Not even my own opinion, it’s literally obvious with the fact that every time someone lands on Thanos’s team they quit. I have been stuck playing games with 7 teammates against 19!

[Long post],"For quite awhile this game has been nothing but a shotgun/smg buildfest, and while it has been fun, it is quickly losing the level of fun it was just a year ago.  Something needs to change, cause this game is quickly getting old for a lot of people. Below i am going to name a few suggestions that could easily shake the game up enough that it could breathe a majorly need breath of life into the game 


**Inventory system change.**

Honestly i think this is one thing that needs to happen regardless, i think this is one area where fortnite can learn from other br's and change their inventory system. I know it is meant to be more basic, but having it this way causes problems that other brs dont really have. I think fortnite needs to go to a more standard inventory system, where you have 2 or 3 weapon slots ( 2 preferably, 3 if the 3rd one is a pistol, but ill get into that in a min) , and then you have meds and shield slots, ones that dont matter how many guns you have in a slot, as long as you arent over weight you can carry them. Not sure id add ammo to this because ammo isnt really a concern imo, but then again most brs do this. Doing this would allow having meds more often, and constantly, and third partying could potentially be lessened.

**Remove bloom, add recoil.**

Ultimately with being able to carry so many different weapons you kind of have to balance things out differently then you would if you only had 2 weapon slots. Right now with bloom you can easily miss thirty shots from an ar and smg if you are holding left click, even when you arent that far from your target, but if they lowered the weapon slots down to two it could change the way weapons work from ""everything has its job"" to "" certain weapons are better for (insert thing here) but, any gun can do it."" If you remove bloom and allow smgs and ars to be more close range weapons, it allows people to play how they like, opening everything up to more playstyles. Yes i can use an ar in close range, but that doesnt mean the guy who chose the shotgun doesnt have a slight advantage over me because it is designed to be better up close, but it is my choice what i carry, and it comes down to who is more skilled with what they like.

**Remove literally every weapon and start with all new ones** 

Pretty basic idea, wipe the slate clean and give us all brand new weapons, let a new meta form from nothing. 

Let me know what you guys think.",FortNiteBR

Siphon was in the game for 1 month and 2 weeks, after 2 weeks of it in the game they added the volcano, cannons, and volcano vents across half of the map (&amp; for the last 2 weeks ballers were added). Now maybe I'm crazy but don't you think maybe all of that mobility, which is always there compared to rng mobility, may have caused more engagements. And maybe casual players were tired of getting third partied all the time bc players are gliding all over the map and seeing fights to third party. Balloons, zip lines, launch pads, glider redeploys, rifts, rift to goes, hover boards, and quadcrashers were already in the game. I'm not saying take out mobility, I'm saying maybe the mobility added was the reason engagements were going up and casuals were playing less, maybe casuals enjoyed siphon but you wont do a poll to figure it out, you just think your players are wrong and you're right, and that's frustrating.

&amp;#x200B;

Me personally, I don't mind siphon being gone, I think the game would be better for all players with it back, but either way idc. I also don't mind all of the mobility, what really grinds my gears is that you put in so many bad, unique weapons in, and then leave them in for months, a small fraction of the player base uses them, but you keep them in anyways. I have a strong feeling you keep bad weapons in the game so that good players will be unfortunate enough to get them in their first 3 chests and then have a new players stumble upon them and shotty them for an easy elim, increasing their chances of winning the game. The problem is new and casual players get them too, why would they want to keep playing the game when a 1/3 of their games they dont even have a chance because they got a scoped revolver, or a thermal/scoped ar, or dynamite instead of shields inside their first chest. Why would they want to keep playing when 80% of good ars they find are aks, they get destroyed by regular ar spray. They are trying to learn the game, and yet they dont learn anything from a 1/3 of their games bc they get unlucky.

&amp;#x200B;

Why are pistols in the game? Why haven't you removed thermal ar, scoped revolver, aks (heavy ars), dynamite, infantry rifles, flint lock pistols, dual pistols, and hand cannons? How do you expect new console players to use any of that, why do you think we enjoy these guns, or are they in the game still bc you know we don't enjoy them :(. I'm all for keeping the game fresh but don't leave these weapons in for months. The game used to not have much luck to it, you had to worry about getting a blue ar not a grey ar, but now luck is heavily involved, you have to dodge all of these bad weapons before you can try to learn the game, and I'm sure thats demotivating.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not saying remove everything except the ar, smg, and shotty. I'm saying half of the weapons aren't used by 95% of players.

END

&amp;#x200B;

SUGGESTION:

If you truly think your players enjoy dodging these weapons then here is a billion dollar suggestion: starting in season 9 or 10, put in a permanent game mode. The Oldschool gamemode. You start with season 1, the same graphics, lighting, guns (but current gun mechanics), and map that season 1 had, but with minis, half pots, and slurps. Leave this in for 1 whole season, and then comes season 2 and so on. We know Epic Games has the assets to afford this, and so many people would start playing the game, you could even charge a 950 vbucks admission fee to play the gamemode (from a business perspective tho, i'd make season 1 free, then start charging for following seasons to let new players see if they like it before they have to buy vbucks). Don't bring back the battlepass rewards, let ogs have the unique dances and gliders we don't care, we just want to have fun again. I also think the last season should be 4 or 5 and then leave it there or discontinue it, because it starts to go downhill from there. If you did this it'd be truly Epic.",FortNiteBR

This isn’t your average “add back double pump” post. I’m gonna prepare for the downvoted however, just because I like something.

Have you ever played some game back when you were a kid, and loved it and enjoyed it? For example, Pokémon games, n64 games, etc? You would play it all day for hours on end and make many memories with your friends. Then, when you got older, you lose the game and can’t find it. You’re devastated and would do anything to get it back. You keep thinking of solutions to get it back, but they’re all unreasonable. You get desperate once you start losing hope.

It’s the same way with double shotgunning. It was the most fun mechanic in the game and rewarded skill, something that most of the playerbase loved. It was a skill to learn, and once you learned how to use it, you were rewarded. It was powerful, but only in the right hands. One of the most satisfying to pump them for 90, switch to the other pump, and shoot that back to back. It felt like a beat to a song sorta.

And it was removed. This obviously devastated those who used it and loved it. It promoted another playstyle that was introduced forcefully, pump-smg. It wasn’t organic, it wasn’t something the community made up. It was forced, and forced hard. It was annoying to play against, and annoying to use when bloom screwed you over, or if it wasn’t your playstyle. All of your practice with double shotgunning and learning how to use it is gone.

And now you’re stuck with using an annoying playstyle. Don’t use it, and you’re at a disadvantage.

Now, not only do you love double shotgunning, but the hate for SMGs makes you want it back even more. You want some other variety in the game.

Now it’s season 8. The main game has changed drastically, but one thing has remained the same. Pump-smg has been the meta for almost 5 seasons. Sure, some came and went, but pump-smg has reigned over those. And to those who used double shotgunning, a hole is left in their heart. At least in mine. I’ve never thought the game never needed change ever since they removed it. I’m never satisfied, nothing can fill that infinite hole of not having it. The game just isn’t as fun.

It really wouldn’t hurt to add in creative. Adding it back in the main game modes is a controversial topic(I would love it to IMO)however, since people pretty much have PTSD of facing it because people weren’t as good back then, so they were easily destroyed. Now people are better and won’t die to it, as people build now. But that’s off topic.

Epic please, it really wouldn’t hurt to add to creative, and would fill my(and most likely a lot of others)heart, and I would enjoy the game. But don’t add it back to the main game modes unless you can balance it.

Thank you and that concludes my TED Talk.",FortNiteBR

All of the players and streamers claiming they r quoting after the World Cup would most likely stay and it would also bring back players who already quit. Adding a new map would also bring the focus off of everything bad about the game now like the bugs. While we learn the new map there would be no need to add new items for a while and can instead work on fixing everything in the game. Right now a lot of people want epic to take some time to fix the game instead of making new items. But right now epic wants to keep the game fresh by adding new items instead of fixing the game.

Firstly, when Chitauri aims, it zooms in on them and honestly is difficult to move around

Second, some weapons counter Chitauri really well like the iron man repulsers 

Third, this gamemode encourages ganging

Fourth, I find that thanos’ team has really bad mentality, I go in thanos’ team and find that many leave before the last 2 stones land.

Fifth, the captain America shield can do 250 damage on thanos, it’s crazy.

Sixth, stormbreaker gets in everyone’s way, even their own team.

Seventh, although the speed boost, heroes can still move faster than Chitauris

Eighth, some people don’t put in effort and wait for thanos to die, hoping they become thanos.

Ninth, controlling thanos is just... ugh

Tenth, I can still get 2 shotted even if I have all stones and max health.

If it is not predominant enough, I feel like thanos and gang are at a HUGE disadvantage with the heroes. To win, your team’s thanos must be skilled, which is not the point of this gamemode.",FortNiteBR

Hello everyone, we have recently been revising our rules over the last month and have come to what we think is a more beneficial, clear and precise rule set which should help with a more relaxed approach to moderation and allow for more consistent moderation.

We have made changes to almost all of our current rules which are as follows:

## Relevancy Guidelines

We changed the main header of this rule to:

&gt; All posts should feature Fortnite or the associated culture in some way. 50% of all content posted must directly relate to Fortnite: Battle Royale.

This should allow for more user created posts with other assets and give the ability for more user creative posts.

We added a couple of new points to this rule also:

&gt; * Videos and images captured in Creative mode then posted in relation to BR must use replay mode for cinematic purposes only. The only exceptions to this are new item demos and training courses.

&gt; * Videos and images filmed in Creative must not show Creative-only items (coins, music blocks, etc.)

&gt; * Training courses and new item demo videos are allowed to be filmed in Creative and posted to BR. This means if you are practicing for BR in a training course, or showing off a new item, you may share a clip. Deathruns or any other type of obstacle course are not allowed. If you created a training course and want to showcase it, you must post it in r/FortniteCreative. Only gameplay from these courses is allowed on BR. Any posts showcasing a creation you made may be subject to removal, and you may not share creative codes.

These points overall relate to creative and what we allow from creative mode crossed with BR. We wanted to allow certain aspects of creative mode to be allowed on /r/FortNiteBR if they directly relate to the BR game mode. With these new points, we can allow certain courses, weapon demos and similar which the point of the post is to show the effects in BR. 

## Title Guidelines

We have significantly changed this rule to be more lenient for post titles. Allowing for more creative and artistic titles. We still have our set restrictions on titles such as no ALL CAPS and no AlT CaPs but generally most titles should be allowed. 

The set restrictions we have on titles are as follows: 

&gt; * Post titles in caps or in alt-capitalization (e.g., YoU RuSt LoRdS).

&gt; * Post submissions with bodies that only consist of title references (e.g., “Title” or “Check the title”).

&gt; * Use “unpopular opinion, hot take, sorting by new” and similar formats.

&gt; * Include ""mods removed previous post"" or similar phrasing.

## Humor Guidelines

We changed the main header of this rule to:

&gt; Memes must include Fortnite assets, and generic internet template meme images that can be found online are not allowed.

&gt; Recreated popular internet image or video memes must contain Fortnite content captured by you from within Fortnite. You cannot re-use footage or images posted previously by another user. If a popular meme formula becomes frequently posted, memes made using that formula are subject to removal.

This should be more clear in what type of humor/meme posts are allowed on the sub. The premise of the rule is to remove the classic template memes anybody can make to get some quick karma, we want to see user created content and allow any humor posts someone has spent time making.

We also added/changed the following points: 

&gt; * If your video contains any type of audio distortion or bass boost, the title must contain an audio warning.

&gt; * No starter packs or deep fried memes.

&gt; * All humor posts must abide by relevancy guidelines.

&gt; * Generic pastes of Fortnite assets onto memes are not allowed.

This should shed some clarity on what content is and isn't allowed.

## Suggestion Guidelines

We spent time on working out a good balanced rule to help sift out irrelevant, low-effort suggestions but still allow people to offer creative suggestions and not have a biased view on the quality of the post itself as moderators. Our previous rule was over complicated and the following rule will show specifically on what suggestions can be posted and what will be subject to removal. The basic principle is that user created suggestions are generally allowed and something grabbed from google images will be removed.

&gt; Suggestions that cannot be fully understood from the image or other media must be in a text post with at least 75 characters of describing text, not including the title or comments. Images pulled from search engines or similar sources are prohibited. Suggestions with generic imagery, less than 75 characters, or without notable effort will be subject to removal.

## Discussion Guidelines

Nothing extra has been changed or added which is of high significance but we have changed the rule to be more digestible and easy to understand. Social media screenshots will be allowed as long as they are from a community figure/epic as the majority of [this voting thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b7exmr/rfortnitebr_community_poll_social_media/) was in favor of keeping them. One main point that was added though was: 

&gt; * No text posts as images. If your image is only text, it must be in a text post.

This point is pretty self explanatory and should help remove the low effort text-image posts.

## No Calls to Action

The main aspect of this rule is to allow general information and news posts that call out a public figure within reason. Sufficient evidence has to show this and shouldn't be biased to a certain view. Posts such as accusing hackers and similar nature are not allowed. The header for this rule is as follows:

&gt; Posts on community figures and individuals who open themselves up to exposure from the community are allowed as long as the posts are civil, factual, and do not post personal/confidential information.

This protects anyone from being accused of an action who displays little or no evidence or if it shows anything which could be physically damaging to an individual.

We also added the following point:

&gt; * Both posts and titles must be neutral; if your post tries to spin a narrative, it is subject to removal.

This will stop any altered posts to make a community figure look worse than the action they may have taken and deceitful posts may be subject to removal. Posts accusing a community figure should be represented in a reasonable fashion.

## Frequently Posted Topics

We changed this rule slightly to allow posts to talk about previous hot topics but not so much that they are spammed. Also the epic plz wiki will no longer be enforced and this rule should cover all aspects of FPT. The following rule addition allows this:

&gt; * If the topic of your post can be found on the first four Hot pages, it will be considered a FPT.

We also wanted to be clear in what other type of frequent topics are subject to immediate removal based on their previous spammy nature:

&gt; * Current permanent FPT topics: ""bring back x"" , loadouts, traversal emote requests, llama posts, lobby glitches.

We believe this should help for more clarity in what is considered FPT and how to ensure you don't cover a currently spammed topic at the time.

These are all the main changes to the rules and if we feel there are any flaws or there is a demand for certain types of posts that need to be removed or allowed then we may review these rules again in the future. However, with these rules it should be easier for users to understand and more creative posts will be more evident because of these rules.

# Moderator Recruitment

With all the new rule changes we also need some new moderators to enforce these rules. We will be running moderator applications for about a week and are excited to bring on some potential candidates. You are required to be over 18 and have regular access to discord. If you are to be considered for further discussion after reviewing your application, we will reach out directly via discord. So if you are interested in applying you can find the application form below.

This is because the pump shotgun outperforms the tactical shotgun in almost every single way. Currently, there is no reason to pick up a tac over a pump. The pump had received a huge buff months ago, so why not do the same with the tac? Maybe increase the damage of every variant by about 10-15, lower the bloom a little bit, and increase the mag from 8 to 10. This buff could potentially make the tac on par with the pump or atleast make more people use it mid-end game, because I only see people using the tac early game when A: it's their first gun and they're forced to use it or B: they dont have a pump. Epic likes to cater to casuals and I know that some casuals like the tac, which gives Epic more reason to buff it. Also, if you won't buff the tac then vault it and replace it with the heavy shotgun because I know that more people prefer the heavy over the tac. This is just my opinion and a suggestion so don't take it personally.",FortNiteBR

I have been getting massive fps drops in the last month or so of playing, see some others with the same issue.
I used to get about 80fps, 60hertz monitor, so call it 60fps. But now I'm getting anything from 80 to 12fps.

I have deleted and reinstalled windows and all update to date drivers, the only thing the PC has on it is fortnite. With driver etc.

I have an:
i5 3570k 3.40ghz up to 3.80ghz
16gb ram
Gtx 1050 2gb
The hhd it's on is a 7200rpm 3tb.

I havnt changed the system specs in the last month. All the same.

Anyone know of a fix or any info?

Thanks",FortNiteBR

Eliminate 100/150/200 Opponents

Revive Teammates 20/30/40 Times

Outlive Opponents 1000/2000/3000

Planes are, well, who wants to be 3rd partied by a plane?

Chillers are nearly useless.

Grapplers, while not as obnoxious as drum guns, had the same effect as drum guns in that it dramatically skewed the competative meta. If you didn't have one end game you were screw.

Basically is like this you have lets say renegade raider,dire skin,and black knight it would be like this the head of renegade raider legs of the dire skin and body of the black knight but you can change the colors of those things like you want the body of the black knight blue instead of black or blue legs instead grey.

There are 287 trees and cacti in Paradise Palms. 30•287=8160.

I also counted the chests in Paradise Palms, but only in the main areas (South Town AKA Mexico, Paradise Palms [City], and Gus [Racetrack]). Even then the region has a whooping 56 chests.

On to Moisty Mire (Season 4, with movie studio)

There are different trees within Moisty Mire, one that is small, and grants 30 wood, one that is medium, that grants 50 wood, and one that is large, that gives 100 wood.

I will do the same equation, except multiplying the number of trees / branches by the numbers above rather than 30 every time.",FortNiteBR

- Season 8 will include another Overtime event similar to Season 7, where players can earn rewards including the season 9 Battle Pass
- Season 9 will end July 24th instead of the projected July 10th, so that the World Cup Finals will be played in Season 9, not Season 10 
- We still have not gotten a double XP weekend, when there are typically two at the end of the season
- No official launch date has been announced for Season 9 besides the In-game countdown, which has changed in the past


All this evidence lead me to the conclusion that Season 8 will be extended by two weeks. Next weeks update will not be v9.00, but rather v8.60, and will include the Overtime event and double XP weekends. The length of Season 9 will not be changed by the delay for the World Cup, rather, Season 8 will be extended and Season 9 will run its typical course.

Any tips?,"So I have played exactly 28 games of Endgame, and Thanos's team has won all but 2 of them. Of the 26 games that Thanos team won, 3 were relatively close, but the other 23 were blowouts, with the Chitari army having anywhere from 30 to as many as 90 respawns left when they won.

Thankfully, in the two games I've been in where the Hero team won, I was on the Hero team, so I only need one more victory for the challenge, but I've had no luck for most of the day today. Here's some of the strategies I've been using and other observations:

1) it does not seem helpful to enclose the infinity stones in builds. The only avenger item that wrecks builds is thor's hammer, and on the flipside, every Chitauri player starts the game with a strong anti-build weapon, so structures around the infinity stones tend to help them more than the Hero team.

2) once there are only two stones remaining, it is incredibly important for everyone on the hero team to stay near the stones because Thanos can just walk up and grab the stone while tanking damage if there aren't more than 3 or 4 heroes there to attack him. Because of this, I have taken to spamming waypoints around the last one or two stones in an attempt to rally my teammates.

3) I've found that Iron Man's weapon is great for evading attacks while also watching for approaching enemies. Cap's shield seems to be the best weapon at closer range, so I always try to find those two weapons if possible. Hawkeye's bow isn't great for either of these purposes, but makes an excellent sniper if you can find a safe vantage point to watch a stone from.

Any other tips or strategies to try? Thanks!",FortNiteBR

The normies couldn’t handle getting killed off spawn (because they sucked) so instead of just playing a different game they forced this cod trash, team rumble, into a BR game. 

It’s like going to a Michelin 5 star 7 course meal restaurant and instead of just saying I don’t like what’s on the menu and walking out, normies have to bring the Big Mac they bought earlier to eat in the 5 star restaurant. Eventually the restaurant see more and more people in their restaurant eating Big Macs so you know what happens? They add Big Macs onto the menu.",FortNiteBR

Why now are we satisfied with them using popular culture and fairytale characters as a crutch for the basis of entire seasons? Santa Claus's army invaded, completely unrelated to any narrative they had built up until then, and now it's all about pirates and the big season-ending event is a vault that lets us vote on an old weapon that no one ever liked?  


As if this isn't lazy enough, the game is broken and unbalanced in so many ways. I'm not saying there needs to be a boycott until they can hold themselves to a higher standard and deliver quality content that warrants billions of dollars in profit, but I am saying that this need to be voiced until Epic fully understands that they're failing at their job and forcing their employees to drain themselves of quality ideas and motivation to do good work by over-working them and not delivering on their promises.

Every since the bolt was vaulted finding a scoped sniper was hard, I saw no issues with the bolt and I was surprised with its disappearance. Missing a sniper shot in a BR game should be punishing it should be loud and alert the enemies on your location. It’s impossible to hear the suppressed sniper unless very close to it.

**The suppressed sniper encourages camping** (Because no one will know where you are even though your shooting) 

Since sniper are **very hard to find ** The gold version should be removed and blue should be added  making it a little more common.

Overall adding the bolt and vaulting the suppressed would solve everything but that is why I hate the suppressed sniper.",FortNiteBR

Better builders should win more

All I’m saying is that in the past is was much easier to shoot down someone’s build or take fall damage. Overtime we have add gliders and other mobility items to take that threat away. Building has also increased in speed with spam turbo building, so in the time it takes to shoot a slab of wood, someone has built 8 more.

Explosive weapons have been nerfed overtime too. And grenades are replaced by a weaker clinger IMO. I think it made sense to nerf these when we did, but now I’m starting to think they need a tiny buff to be as useful again (let’s leave boom bow out of this, that is not a build counter anyway)

So drum gun, or mini gun buff could be a good fix to this. Bringing back boom boxes to OG status would be an idea(I assume instant downvotes begin here)

Just a thought. I feel we got way too far down the building meta that we get upset if you die by anything other than a shotgun in a build/edit standoff.

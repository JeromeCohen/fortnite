I've been playing for nearly a year now and as time went on I felt like my skills have been progressing slowly but surely (I have 52 solo wins)--up until season 8.  I like the new season in theory (like the aesthetics and new areas), but holy shit I feel like I'm starting the game over.  Situations that used to be easy are now really hard.  

At first I just thought maybe I was just having a bad few days and just making more mistakes.  No big deal.  A default rolls up on me and I have a hard time aiming to hit them, then when I build and it seems like they can shoot right through my builds.  Or just having a big lag glitch where one moment I'm running towards someone to shoot them, there is a frozen screen for a split second while I'm running in place, then all of a sudden I'm dead without even seeing what hit me.  These things I can accept and just try again every now and then, but this has been happening all the time now--like every game.  Is it in my head that people can shoot faster than me?  So many more times lately in close range shotgun shoot outs I literally feel like I've pulled the trigger and am expecting a kill, only to be blow away with my finger still jamming down on the trigger.

I even went back to older, less fun strategies to try and win matches (I nearly always play solo), and still having a hard time.  You know, like landing in an isolated area, camping, hiding, then giving it your all in the last few circles.  Still having a really hard time with that.

I've watched a few videos on Youtube and read some threads on here about how console players are having a lot of problems, glitches, etc.  Most of them only talk about Xbox and PS4.  I've heard that the Switch version is the one that runs the worse.  So what can I do to try and get the game to run better?  I never mess with settings or anything, maybe I need to fine tune that?  But I don't know what combos or setting work best.  

Or should I buy an Xbox?  I've heard that of all the consoles, that one runs best?

Or are things as bad as some people say, like Gronky, who recently suggests these issues are not going to get any better?  If that's the case, maybe I just need to find a new game to play?

Thanks for any feedback or info.",FortNiteBR

The amount of treasure maps I see early game, is ridiculous, and by the second circle, everyone has at least one or two gold guns.

I think they should reward less than FOUR guns, and be a lot lot rarer. That way, if you get one, it’s a rewarding feeling and a major reward, as it now feels like everyone has it, and if you don’t you’re at a disadvantage. Sorry for being so long winded:)",FortNiteBR

What we need is TWO Leviathans which cannot be killed. Making two different images appear large is easy with perspective tricks, but to avoid pathfinding problems the typical Leviathan concepts have, these Leviathans will be floating giants similar to the Ice King in the Ice King event, or to Marshmello. 

Each Leviathan spawns on one side of the island. Each team tries to attack the other Leviathan as the two approach each other. 

When they meet in the middle, they start beating on each other in a scripted event. Whichever took more gunfire dies first. 

This looks cooler than just having the two leviathans follow the battle bus paths until the other team blows them up. That’s just boring. 

Thank you for coming to my LTM talk.

So my idea is: if there's less than 40 people alive before The first storm hasn't even started, it takes a 30 second headstart. This would happen to The first 3 storms and The player limits could be 40, 30, and 25. in all of these 3 storms The time could be -30 seconds off the timer If the  amount of players limit is crossed.

This feature wouldn't affect every game, but when it happens, it will make the match a little faster. This also doesn't fully affect the people landing on the edge of the map, they have all sorts of rotation options like quadcrashers, hoverboards, rifts et cetera. 
This also would have 0 effect on the tournaments because the skill level on tournaments is much higher and everybody is playing for wins overall, so the APL would be reached in very rare occasion

I do understand that building has improved due to the rising skill gap and new building techs improving the meta. Actually, I think building it self is great. Building defines what Fortnite is, and it is what separates the game from its competitors. However, in the more current state of the game building has been dumbed down so much to the point where all you have to do is mash buttons and hold down the fire button. Of course turbo-building is great and should be in the game, but it has reached a point of being obnoxious. So, I was trying to think of ways that the game could possibly nerf building so that it isn't as annoying. Of course, building does take skill, but I believe that it is just at the point where anyone could do it very easily and do it well. I can't personally think of any ways to nerf building without the game completely falling through, so what do you guys think?

At the end of season 4, the community agrees that this was the most balanced point. Maybe now it might be even more balanced, but it doesn’t have as much playstyles as season 4.

Now, we all know that smgs got many buffs during season 4. The main reason was to counter the dominant playstyle of double shotgunning, and it worked out well. Neither one was more powerful than the other, and whoever played the best won.

However, at the start of season 5, they removed double shotgunning. All of those balance changes that they made to counter double shotguns were now taking over the game.

Think of it like this:

Season 4: 50 double shotguns/50 smgs

Season 5: 0 double shotguns(as they were removed)/100 smgs.

And then they started adding more smgs and buffing them even further, and that made it 10x worse.

TL/DR: What I’m trying to say is the removal of double shotguns completely threw off the balance of the game since they didn’t revert the games that were made to *counter* double shotguns.

My best friend works at epic and told me this about season 8 and 9.

**SEASON 8 INFORMATION**
During season 8, there will be a live event with a kraken coming out from under the island. It is discovered that Blackheart is in control of this kraken. This will then split the map into about 4 parts, the ice king and prisoner can't stop the blackheart alone so they team up. Most of the volcano will end up turning to obsidian. Then with this all in effect ice + fire isn't the best combination, 2 of the parts of the island get flooded over. ice kind and prisoner manage to kill blackheart, and they win. a live event will be hosted for most of that. EDIT: It's the left half of the map that gets flooded.

**SEASON 9 INFORMATION**
The two islands that were flooded will rise back up to the surface, they will be completely empty and only have grass in a couple trees along with a bit of wreckage still attached. after a bit of constructions some of the best blocks will be implemented as actual places in the game. half of tilted towers remains attached but all flooded and broken, tilted towers will be renamed to Tumbling Towers which will then lead to a a live event of all of tumbling towers being destroyed. oh and yeah i forgot to mention boats will be added so you can get around the 4 islands, these will be respawnable so you cant just get trolled. season 9 will mostly be about restoring the islands.

**SEASON 10 INFORMATION**
right before season 9 ends, there will be a big countdown in the sky counting down from 10, 9, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, then it will say SEASON 8 then the 8 will roll over to 9 and you can hear a bunch of fireworks and shouting the servers will go down and then yeah. thats all I have about season 10 for now but I'll get more info from my friend about this soon.

Where building costs you health.,"The current state of the game has the community split in two groups. The competitive skilled experienced players and the casual or new players. I'd like to suggest a new LTM to somewhat bridge this gap and create a game mode both groups could play together.  


Building is the major skill separator between the two groups. Casual players either don't have the time, or just aren't interested in learning to build (insert your...but the battle is buliding, go play **** game instead, building is the main mechanic catchphrase here).  


Pay the Price LTM would introduce a risk to building. Yes I know you have fall damage but that doesn't stop you spamming walls the second a shot whistles past you. For every build piece placed you will lose 5 health. Mats in this mode will be infinite. No need to farm. All healing items will spawn at higher percentage. Players will need to be more careful when deciding to build. More stategy will be required when engaging enemies.  


Building in duos and squads will effect all your team mates too. One player builds, you all lose health. Squads will be 1 health per build piece and duos will be 2 health. Keep an eye on your team's health before building, make sure everyone has meds.  


That's about it, comment any suggestions or changes you'd make and I look forward to all the bot, git gud, but it's a building game, go play apex, muh skill gap comments. That is of course if this post doesn't get deleted instantly...Hi Mods 👋

It feels like we have nothing of versatility anymore, nothing to give players the ability to play how they want; WHICH IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IN THIS GAME RIGHT NOW IMO. 

What's wrong with being the player who wants to play the stealth game? 
What's wrong with being the player who wants to use explosives weapons? 
What's wrong with being the player who wants to spam bullets at people?
What's wrong with being the player who likes to keep things close and personal?
What's wrong with being the player who wants to camp the skies?
What's wrong with being the player who wants to set traps for others? 
What's wrong with being the player who wants to use utility items?

The answer to all those questions is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. 

This subreddit community is so overly focused on trying to make bad of everything new/different that comes in-game, and that is why we can't have nice things for long, and that is why we have such a small loot pool of weapons/items. 

Ever wonder why you keep seeing so many Infantry Rifles? It's because you all done complained and got everything else removed. Watch, once Epic vaults the Infantry Rifle, you'll all be complaining because you see too many Scoped Pistols next.

There are far more players than just this subreddit and pro players, and frankly Epic just needs to do things however they wants whether or not we complain; I mean they already kinda do but yeah.

As you know, if you are on console you have to go through your items to get to what you want, so if you have slot 1 as your shotgun and slot 2 is a sniper and slot 3 is your smg, you have to cycle through and past he sniper to get to the smg, or go from slot 1 to 5&gt;4&gt;3 which results in the same thing.

I have devised a couple of ideas to help improve it and be back to when it was first introduced. 

*These changes DO NOT apply to regular modes*

- Remove Explosives Entirely 

(They are incredibly annoying to deal with when two or three people spam rockets/grenade launchers at you and get ridiculous amount of kills.)

- Increase Size of Both Circles

(This could reduce the amount of times you spawn in on top of multiple people.)

- Teams Respawn On THEIR Side of the Circle

(Again, should reduce the chances of respawning on the enemy team)

- Reward Teammates With the Most Kills/Punish Teammates That Get the Least Amount of Kills. 

(Debating  whether or not it should be damage dealt or not, but self explanatory. The reward should be bonus XP depending on the amount of kills you got over your other teammates. Vise versa if you do absolutely nothing.)

- Remove Glider Item in Inventory

(Still should be Glider Redeploy, just not as an item.)

TL;DR: I struggle in duo's. What are you supposed to do differently in duo's compared to squads and solo's, or is the skill level just higher?",FortNiteBR

Thankfully, there was still a few days before the skin was set to release and seeing as how it would be unfair to people buying the Galaxy S10/+/E, some even buying the phone for the sole purpose of getting the skin, they decided to perhaps create a new skin. 

I believe they will release Ikonik in the item shop, or for ALL Samsung users, instead of being the exclusive promotional skin for the Galaxy, and they will use a new exclusive skin instead. The odds of me being wrong are fairly high, and they will allow everyone that accessed to keep the skin with no repercussion.",FortNiteBR

I don't have people that I can play duos or squads with, that won't take it so fucking hard when we lose or when I fall short under pressure because of sweats.

I can't play aggressively because I'm so self conscious about taking shots because I already know, ""this guy is going to build an eiffel tower and float on down, and throw a clinger at my crotch.""

My build battle skills are absolute ass, I know all these techniques but I can't even apply them because I can't focus when sweats or just regular people are pushing.

I think this change has no real downsides and has a lot of benefits to the game:

1) it feels like there arent many places to land in squads in fortnite. I feel obligated to go to retail/pleasant/paradise/titled for my whole team to have a decent loadout before moving out. I think having 100% spawn rate would allow for more varied drops and would distribute players out more early game.

2) like many players ive been playing this game for over a year. Im very grateful that they constantly update the map a little here and there, but in ANY game mode it feels like if you want to see anyone before 10 minutes in you have to land at the same places over and over. 

3)there would be more strategy in which building/area of a drop you choose to land at. Knowing which builds have the most chests and where they are located would make the initial drop really important, as its no long up to pure luck. 

4)this wont detract from the “BR games have to have RNG blah blah blah” as you could still get three infantry rifles out of a big house while little timmy gets a gold pump out of a shed next door.

Overall i think it would just limit the “well i got zero guns and died because of it” constantly. Youll still have to make plays with bad weapons, but itd be more fair. And having more places on the map be viable drops would be great for all game modes, even competitive tourneys/scrims. Let me know what you guys think",FortNiteBR

Currently the game is basically a pump shotgun only game, you don’t have a pump your most likely going to die in close combat. This is getting quite stale in my opinion, and we need another shotgun. My proposal; Unvault the heavy shotgun with changes, and there’s two ways epic can do such a thing. 

**One; Give it a nice buff**
The heavy shotgun was eventually vaulted because no one really picked it up, pumps were just more viable, able to one shot someone with ease and just more damage. The heavy shotgun should be able to one shot someone as well, because well, it’s a *HEAVY* shotgun, it should deal quite a lot of damage. 

**Option Two; Unvault it and Vault Tactical Shotgun(?)**
This option is quite an iffy one. The tac is in a weak spot and even a buff probably won’t help it. Vaulting it and unvaulting the heavy shotgun with no stat changes should maybe happen. If they do such a thing they should lower the rarity to maybe Uncommon, Rare, (or Epic).

I recently/currently am experiencing some sour tasting events on epics part.

&amp;#x200B;

epic has shown some signs recently that they are pretty anti consumer, specifically 3 facts i want to talk about.

&amp;#x200B;

if you want to skip my saltiness, skip to the bottom to read why im writing this post.

&amp;#x200B;

\-the first thing that has made me look at them out of the corner of my eye is how they are approaching their store. its recently come to my attention that epic is pulling some tricks that aren't exactly friendly to the gaming market, regarding their attempt to get games to be sold exclusively on their platform which at the moment is purely mediocre. it contains no cloud saving, no offline play, and on top of that they are 40% owned by tencent, an oversized Chinese company that I don't trust. im not going to go into any further detail about any of this because these two posts ([first](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/akwwqg/can_we_please_all_boycott_the_epic_games_store/?utm_source=BD&amp;utm_medium=Search&amp;utm_name=Bing&amp;utm_content=PSR1) and [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/albbhe/the_epic_games_store_is_awful_and_anti_consumer/)) cover it all and I suggest you read both of them. this is not the primary reason im writing this.

&amp;#x200B;

\-the second thing that has got me pissed off enough that I will no longer be spending is this fiasco with the reflex skin being released to the store after there was enough signs and advertisement implying the bundle and its contents were exclusive only to those who bought the qualifying graphics cards, such as I.

&amp;#x200B;

INB4 EVERYONE FLOODS THIS WITH ""IT WASNT EXCLUSIVE/YOU SHOULDNT HAVE SPENT SO MUCH ON A SKIN"" COMMENTS there were several official sources that said it was exclusive which is enough. for those who don't think we should have spent so much money just for the bundle, some of us needed an upgrade anyway. Us pc gamers are a different breed from the console gamers. we don't pay for online play, we have high standards, and for many of us the games or items bundled with a graphics card are the deciding factor between which card or other pc part we buy as opposed to another.

those of us that bought it clearly thought, thanks to epics tricky wording, that we were getting an exclusive pc only skin similar to the Samsung only galaxy, the xbox only eon, ps4 only royal bomber, or the switch only skin none of which have been released to the store, all of which have been out longer than the reflex skin bundle was available. we have not received a variant to differentiate from those that bought it from the item shop and the fact that epic gave a variant for the ""og""  skull trooper owners got a variant but those of us who paid for a skin advertised to us as exclusive is, to me, very dishonest and scummy on their part. im not going to argue with anyone about this as its all been said and if you want to hear about just search this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

but alas this is not the primary reason im upset with epic.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!Final straw!&lt;

\-recently black ops 4 corrupted my c drive because it was shoddily made. or so I thought. I installed black ops and from the get go I had nothing but problems. my computer started acting up, all my programs would act funny, even fortnite was being weird. I exited out of fortnite and my desktop was gone so I restarted my computer where my trip through digit hell began.

several weeks of my computer slowly but surely getting worse each time I turned it on to the point where each time there was a 10% chance I would make it to the log in screen without it sending me straight to the bios, which then showed I had no c drive plugged in. it got so bad that anything I could do to fix the problem, I couldn't do because I couldn't even get my computer to enter safe mode. after wiping and reformatting my c drive several times after not being able to reinstall windows, I managed by the grace of god to get windows to reinstall. I did not reinstall black ops 4.

fast forward to yesterday where I fired up fortnite just to receive a screeching loop of the opening music and a bluescreen that said ""what failed"" anticheat.sys"". currently as I type this I have managed to get my pc to to make it to the desktop without failing but idk if I will be able to again once I restart my computer.

it turns out battleye, fortnites primary anticheat software, is notorious for BSOD's and corrupting hdd's and sdd's due to how it works, which involves it invading your c drive in ways most programs cant. I suggest reading [this comment and its post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8zw6dk/bsod_on_fortnite_launch/e2lxiss) for more information on how invasive this program is and why it can corrupt your entire c drive. this entirely to me is anti consumer given the fact that it has been going on since season five, three seasons ago, and they haven't done anything to fix this. not only that, this program records information about your entire computer and the company is partially owned by one of the largest companies in china. as it stands im very close to boycotting epic games in general, especially knowing they create unreal engine 4, one of the most used engines by game developers. I don't want to reinstall a program that has corrupted my computer twice.

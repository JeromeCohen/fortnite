this would mean for shield availability to remain constant you would need to add, at the very least, 5% more shields to the loot. 

It's actually more than 5% though. like a lot more, maybe double in my estimate. 

like say 50 people died. 50 are alive. of those living 50 some have shields . meaning the ""shield needs"" of the living are LESS than 50 full shields 

and we are adding 5 more people who need full shield. that's where I got the need to increase the spawns 10% if 5 are-rebooted. 

might actually be more than 10% for no-reboot van parity.",FortNiteBR

I see the occasional post about mental health or about how Fortnite has helped people through tough times (struggling with depression, anxiety, etc.). I've recently been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, depression, and my therapist and I have been talking about other possible mood disorders as well. It's been a rough realization. I‚Äôm 29 years old btw. Coinciding with this realization has been a very intense bout of gaming. Before Fortnite, I hadn't seriously played games ever really. I dabbled in Overwatch a couple years back, but that's it. The amount I play and think about Fortnite is on another level. All the time. I  have been excusing it in a variety of ways, but I am starting to wonder if that is healthy. My mental health has always made me very prone to addiction, and I know that gaming has elements to it that are addictive. I have a good job, a loving partner, etc. etc. But it does feel at times that things are slipping out of control and I am not sure if it is just my recent diagnoses that have me feeling a bit raw or if it is related to the gaming obsession.

I guess my question is-- Is there anyone else out there who feels that they play/think about the game far too much? If so, are there mental health things going on for you as well? I want to be able to keep playing because I genuinely do enjoy the game, but I am wondering if I ought to stop considering my mental health. Does anyone have experience with this?",FortNiteBR

Epic was concerned about people getting one shot yet they‚Äôre okay with people getting their health completely melted by 3 shots in the span of 2 seconds? It doesn‚Äôt help that even though the gun isn‚Äôt a close range weapon, people still manage to hip fire it like a pump and one shot you if you don‚Äôt have health. 

The gun is reminiscent of how the pump used to be albeit significantly weaker. Instead of double pumping, this gun fires even faster than that although with roughly half the damage. Spam. Spam. Spam. 

I get that the tactical shotgun has a bigger spread and therefore will be more inconsistent but at least there‚Äôs a trade off for damage considering you‚Äôre likely to hit a crap ton of 20s more so than anything else. The combat has a tighter spread and this is more consistent but that just leaves less room for randomization that shotguns usually have. With a tac, you can hit all kinds of numbers, a 20 body shot, a 150 headshot, or a bunch of random 60 and 70s body shot. With the combat, you‚Äôre either hitting a 70 or a 130, there‚Äôs virtually no in between unless you *really* can‚Äôt hit your shots. 

I mean honestly, is being one shot in one second any different than being three shot in one second? Not really. Sure, you can build and get around it but odds are, people will fire that gun 3-5 times before you can even counter with a wall. 

Honestly, we should just vault this trash gun and bring back the double barrel and heavy shotgun.   The combat is better than the heavy but the heavy is probably a better gun for the game, the double barrel only has two bullets which means you‚Äôre going to have to pick your shots and get super close...it would be nice to have an actual close range weapon instead of being mystified of how I get one shot point blank with a long range shotgun. 

Epic doesn‚Äôt want people getting one shot but seriously, things are no different now. Don‚Äôt want people getting one shot? Let everybody spawn with shield lol. 

The game is at a point where I don‚Äôt even run shotguns anymore, it‚Äôs just not worth it. The closest thing to a pump now is a flint knock pistol, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one using that as a shotgun now. 

Either this gun should be vaulted or it should have a higher damage drop off/slower rate of fire, I can‚Äôt be the only person tired of the spam meta right now, and this gun certainly doesn‚Äôt help.",FortNiteBR

It was the only 4-Man vehicle ever introduced into the game, and unlike what happened with the shopping cart, we haven't gotten any type of replacement for it. You could theoretically say that the Stormwing was supposed to fill that void, but it was vaulted within the same patch as the ATK. 


The ATK was very balanced in that it gave a squad a way to all get around the map together, without being too fast to the point where it couldn't be hit (like the Quad-Crasher). It was also spread across the map quite diversely, and while you could say that the removal of Lazy Links would've significantly reduced the amount that were in the game, Paradise, G-U-S, Neo-Tilted, and Mega Mall, would still supply quite a few. It really was a great and balanced vehicle.

It would need some additional settings:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Players are damage immune on their first drop until they land

2. Weapons have 1 clip of ammo that is not loaded so you cannot just land on somebody because you need to load and use minis

3. Players also drop in with 30 wood.

&amp;#x200B;

The rng on the first drop is the most frustrating part of this game for me. Not bugs, ballers, not the pump being gone (although pretty close), not turtling, not anything. Just the rng of the first drop. 

I don‚Äôt care much for the pro scene but I like arena. All I want to do is drop in a match, usually on the first drop, and have a somewhat fair fight.  I could care less if they looted rockets or a bow or whatever other strong things exist at the moment. As long as I have the aforementioned basics I feel like I have a good chance. Coming out of a house or area and not having a combat shotgun and some form of ar and shields feels terrible and I‚Äôm personally really tired of getting screwed by rng.

[Combat Rifle](https://i.redd.it/ofnc4nfsif031.png)

   I like designing concepts for weapons. We got a combat shotgun, and I think this game needs more assault rifles. The tactical assault rifle is practically an SMG so it doesn't count. Introducing, the COMBAT rifle!

   The combat rifle is available in Epic and Legendary variants. The rough draft of its statistics are below.

 

Statistic: Epic/Legendary

&amp;#x200B;

Damage: 47/51

Reload Time: 6/5.5s 

Fire Rate: 3.3/3.2s 

Magazine Size: 15

Impact: 20/24 

Equip Time: 2s

Headshot Multiplier: 1.5x

I was getting killed by players miles better than me, and the fights I would win I was left with barely any health and would often get third partied and killed when healing up. Squads was the only thing I enjoyed, and even then there was a massive lack of shields. Kills felt unrewarding and I felt no desire to get better at the game. What was the point in farming mats for most the game only to die in seconds?

Then health + mats per kill was added.

For the first time in a while, I felt an incentive to play the game. Kills were rewarding, I could play the game and kill people without having to worry about being left 1 hit, or worry about whether they were carrying shields. For the first time in a while, I wanted to play the game and enjoyed it.

With this new update, I feel like we've gone back to square one. I tasted heaven, and going back just isn't appealing in any way. I mostly play with my squad, so the ranked mode isn't really an option for me. Really hope epic reverts this change, health + mats for kill benefits literally everyone.

Explosive damage through walls?

SMG spam meta in S5?

I feel all this shit encouraged aggression way more than the SPK and MPK but the thing was it wasn’t as skillful.

It isn’t skillful to hold left click and shred through paper walls, isn’t skillful to blow up someone through a wall, was def not skillful to ram planes through everything, was simply obnoxious when everyone in pubs had glider redeploy, and sword I don’t even need to discuss.

I realize a lot of people will disagree based on the sheer amount of comments in the patch thread, but at least let me try to explain where I'm coming from.

The intention of health per kill was good, and in theory it worked because people were playing more aggressively. But it created a huge imbalance in landing spots and mid-game population. Tilted Towers was already the most popular, but it became even more so after 7.40. So much that 60-70% of the lobby was gone before the first storm even started moving. This made the mid-game very slow and uneventful. If you didn't land Tilted, there's a very good chance you wouldn't see a single person for 15+ minutes. The map is huge and there are plenty of POI's with good loot, one location shouldn't dominate as much as Tilted was.

Now onto the mats. This one seems to be the most polarizing, and where most of you will firmly disagree. This is just my opinion, but with the increased farming rates AND mats per kill, pubs essentially turned into Creative. Early-game fights became intense build battles. There was more panic spam building instead of practical building. I lurk this sub frequently and a lot of people complain about the ""sweats that build the taj mahal in 2 seconds."" Well this was part of the reason. I rarely found myself ever needing mats, and on top of that I was always pretty full with brick/metal without having to actually farm it. I know a lot of people think farming is boring (believe me I'm one of them), but if you want a lot of mats you *should* have to farm. That's the tradeoff, land hot and try to slay out, or land cold and loot/mat up.

Anyways that's just my two cents. I don't necessarily think a full revert is the right move long term, but I'm open to it for now to see how things shake up. Sometimes it's good to dial back and reassess. Feel free to tell me I'm wrong, down for debate.",FortNiteBR

The revert of the Pop Up Cup settings doesn’t necessarily help out bad players as they’ll still get crapped on like before. All it does is once again make passive play far more viable. 

Let’s be real for a second; most people don’t enjoy playing passive. The reason this game was getting stale for so many was because of the horrible loot RNG and farming rates. Now we have to experience this again, but now we’re so used to an improved Fortnite and it feels even worse.

I think it’s safe to assume that most people will eventually get tired of playing passive. When I first started playing, I was fine with playing passive. Then after a couple hundred matches or so matches I decided that playing aggressive is a hell of a lot more exciting. This is the switch-up that a lot of the player base has experienced. You get to a certain point where your excitement comes from engagements , and not farming, looting, and camping until the final zone just to experience your first win. And even if this WEREN’T true, you can’t ignore the large part of the player base that enjoys playing aggressively.

As someone who is competitive in nature but doesn’t have plans of entering the comp scene, this change is a huge kick in gut. I’m fine with playing competitively but I think everyone can agree that having to scrim against your skill level 24/7 is exhausting, especially when, as a console player, you’re at a disadvantage. I can’t unwind and enjoy the regular modes anymore. 

I understand bad players don’t like constantly losing to people above their skill level, I really do. But this isn’t going to suddenly make the good players forget how to play. There are ways to go about solving this problem. This isn’t it. 


TLDR: this barely helps out bad players, if at all, and only promotes the passive play style that many players find extremely tedious. Epic, stop trying to nerf good players as if that will help anything and actually try to come up with a legitimate solution to benefit everyone. ",FortNiteBR

[DISCUSSION]","I really don't think reverting health and mats on kill is the worst decision. It is in effect going to make the competitive playlist more active, which will make the wait times to find a match shorter. I believe it was a necessary change, or at least a worthwhile experiment to test the popularity of the Arena mode.

With that said, the one thing I really think should have been kept in the main modes is the *increased farming rate*. Health on kill definitely did promote more aggressive play, which in turn made the game harder for casuals, but I really see no downside to having an increased farm rate. It makes the game a little quicker and would benefit casuals as well, farming for 8 minutes just to get killed your first encounter is a bad experience.

    50/50/50 mats per kill
    50 Health per kill
    40% increase to farming

This is coming from a casual player. 

If you think this will cut down on the amount of people killing DBNO players then you are wrong.If I kill someone in a game, I will likely thirst them immediately unless I am in immediate danger. I will do this because that person will have mats and i’ll have a chance of getting healables. 
 
If you think anyone, casual or try hard, wants to farm for 10 minutes in a game just to waste all of it in a single fight you are wrong. I understand you want to slow the game down, but farming isn’t a fun aspect of the game what so ever. 

You could’ve made many different changes to lower the thirsting rates and speed of the game. Some could’ve been   
     Increasing immunity of DBNO players to 5 seconds or just longer than before
     lowering the harvesting rate to 20% instead of completely reverting it back to the original rate.
There are so many options/ paths you could’ve taken to make this game better.

The changes made in patch 7.40 were liked by many. I don’t remember hearing a single complaint about them. If you are going to change the direction of the game don’t take away something you have gotten good feedback about. I understand that you guys have a specific direction you want the game to go in, but often in life plans change and sometimes it’s for the better.

I feel like Fortnite was in an amazing state and I could play it for hours, but know I find it hard to even want to get on. I don’t want sweat to have to play the playlist that I want, which is now put in arena mode essentially a pop up cup/ ranked mode.

(An intelligent discussion),"After playing fortnite for over a year, HUNDREDS (as I’m sure many of us have spent) of dollars blown on cosmetics. I was really tired of the lackluster changes, nerfs, and additions (like planes) and was about to hang it up on one of the best games I had ever played. Health/shield and mats per kill completely changed that. Made it worth it to play again, and I really was having fun. It gave me a reason to get on again, and I told myself that if they ever took it away (which holy shit I did not think they would) that the game would become unbearable, and it has. Solo squads is now 10x harder, and solos are ridiculous. Good luck getting out of a clusterfuck situation now. Sure it will still happen, but way less likely and way more difficult. I don’t think ANYONE disliked the health/mats per kill changes. It made pushing (for competitive players) worth it. It made playing at a slower pace (for i players) worth it, for if they did earn that kill against a “sweat” they were replenished for it and way more prepared for their next fight as they learn the game. Good luck for jonesy just trying to pop some minis next time he gets caught in a bad spot. A big pot? Yeah he’s dead for sure. It’s a third party feast again. 1/10 this patch. We need performance updates. Console is a joke right now, and some of the best PC’s money can buy are even suffering too. Instead, we get the best change this game has seen in SEASONS taken away.

Epic said that it provoked too aggressive of gameplay, which is understandable considering they have to cater to the vast majority of individuals who play that don’t take it as seriously as us, who are reading about the game on reddit lol.

However, the removal of health per kill wasn’t just disliked among the “good players” but it’s sounding like everyone dislikes it (rightfully so).  And I think Epic is smart enough to realize that there needs to be a middle ground.  Some change that rewards eliminations, but not in a way that allows players to fly all over the map killing bots and ruining their experience game after game.

So here’s my suggestion and it’s a bit unorthodox, but just consider it and let me know what you think:

———————————————————————.  
• When a player gets an elimination, instead of immediately granting them 50 health/shield like we’re used to, instead - have a guaranteed drop of 3 bandages and a 1 mini shield.  This guarantees that the player is rewarded with health for a kill, but they still have to use the items.  Sounds annoying, but none of the heals take long to apply at all and we have to remember that this is a casual playlist.  But this way, players are still rewarded for their elimination and it helps eliminate that third party from just 1 shorting you with an AR from 200m away.
———————————————————————

Now I don’t know if it’s best to drop the bandages and mini at the players feet or with the rest of the loot, but nonetheless, I think this solves the issue we’re going to see (and already seeing) with the public playlists.

I don’t understand why epic would listen to players that go on the game for an hour a week, they probably play one game and get upset and quit. So why on earth should these players get listened to? 

Also it’s almost as though these bitter players expect the people who are good at the game to just stop being good just so they can feel better about themselves. They complain about better players building as if this game isn’t based on building. As a player that is good at the game it got to the point where I would actually start feeling bad after killing another player but why tf should I feel bad for being good at a game??

It’s funny because most of their posts start with “I’m a casual player, I can only play on Thursdays for about 3 games” if you play for such a small amount of time why on earth do you think that you get to suggest changes to the game? Players who actually enjoy the game will have to deal with these bs changes 24/7 just so you can feel better about yourself for an hour on a Thursday.

&gt; - We’re not satisfied with the current use of Ballers, specifically in the late game. With the v8.30 update, we will release a change that will allow players to shoot through the glass of The Baller.
&gt;  - Non-glass parts will still have collision and block damage from bullets.


Look, I get it, the competitive scene wants a fun game with competition and they don't want planes crashing into them or 30 people in balls in the final circles. While I may personally disagree with some of their justifications, I completely understand where they're coming from.

That being said, ***what the hell is the point of even having fun and investing vehicles if you're just going to nerf the shit out of them?*** As far as ballers are concerned, I think it's pretty safe to say that a vast majority of this community loves them and most, if not another vast majority, of those who love ballers think they were in a perfectly fine spot. Removing damage from collision? That's fine and I don't think anyone cares all that much about that, however, now we're considering making the baller pilot vulnerable to damage? The baller already has ***only 300 HP*** and can be shattered to pieces with **TEN** bullets from a standard AR.

With the addition of ""The Arena"" there is absolutely no excuse why the main modes should keep getting the short end of the stick. I think it's fair to say that the main modes can be considered ""casual"" modes now, versus the ranked Arena. As for an answer to this, I offer two possible solutions;

Firstly, there is no conceivable reason as to why there cannot be two alternate versions of the baller, one for competitive and one for casual. One that can be shot through and one, as it is in it's current state, being a fun vehicle.

And secondly, remove vehicles from competitive modes altogether. It seems that, as far as the comp scene is concerned, there is no vehicle that is viable for competitive, they are all either too strong or too weak and due to this they are either abused, never used or are used in very select situations.

TL;DR With the introduction of ""The Arena"" there is no reason to ruin a fun and entertaining vehicle for the sake of the competitive scene when you could just as easily make separate vehicles or adjust other parameters such as spawn rates and availability, if not flat out removing vehicles from competitive modes altogether.

Was thinking about the changes in todays patch specifically the health and mats bonus removed due to excessive aggressive behaviour.

I don't think aggressive play styles should be punished, i think what makes the game less enjoyable is the spray/spam meta which has really been a thing since double shotguns have been removed. Its a real pain boxing up and getting sprayed with smgs ARs and miniguns and then also the explosives etc.

I think damage done to builds by spray weapons should be reduced to make building out of situations viable but pickaxe structure damage increased to give the aggressor a strategy too. It would also help with 3rd parties being less effective from range, they would be encouraged to engage in close(r) quarters combat and take up more risk of an ongoing fight. Also explosives would be more useful if spray damage to structures is reduced.

With the recent removal of the material farming buff and health regenration upon kill I think Epic made a weird move. Clearly, they're trying to comfort the more casual players who don't want to ""sweat"" their ass off. I get that. But instead of removing/scaring the so called ""sweats"" from casuals, why don't the casuals just get like a different mode for ""new players"" or ""once-a-week players"". I enjoy both competitive and casuals, or at least I used to, because when I wasn't enjoying competitive, I could go and play casuals because there was nothing at stake. I didn't mind losing in pubs at all, or not nearly as much as in competitive. Now however, I don't even feel like 'chilling' in normal duos at all, because of the recent removal of material farming buff (and health upon kill),which makes the game very slow. I personally think that thristing will not be affected at all, since people now need to kill to get more heals (whereas before they would kill to get instant health). There is still no insentive to let downed opponents live (if that is what Epic tried to fix here. They talked about agressive playstyles). At least getting killed felt justified the last few weeks, because it wasn't for nothing. I knew an enemy would finish me for health in stead of well nothing.

I think they should re-add the material farming buff (for the sake of not becoming a more boring farming simulator) and 50 health/shield upon kill (for the sake of being killed for something instead of almost nothing). Instead of removing the ""sweats"" from casuals, give the players that Epic are changing things for now a different mode that is only accesible to certain players. Everyone would still be able to play both casual and competitive, and the players thay have been complaining about ""sweats"" would still get a sweat-free lobby. I'm not sure how it should be called or how they would implement this and determine who can join, but I think this is a more suitable solution for everyone.",FortNiteBR

No more 50 health/shield on elimination, no 50/50/50 of each material on elimination, and worst of all, no increased harvesting rate, and 999 cap.

Siphon on elimination was probably the most viable thing that could give the victims of 3rd party a chance to fight back. Sure, it resulted in more thirsting, but there’s a respawn van coming to the game that’s not too far off from release! It provided a reward for killing someone, be it aggressively or casually. And yes, while there was a lot of sweaty and aggressive players, now that Arena mode is out, they should be mitigated from popping up in public matches.

And now, we’re back to farming simulator. For the first 10 minutes of the game we’re forced to farm materials instead of going out there and killing people. Sure, building is a core mechanic of Fortnite, but it shouldn’t completely take over everything we do in-game, it’s just too....boring.

The thought was that it would allow standard lobbies to become less of a ""sweat fest"". Many discussion were had on the pros and cons of doing this in a BR game, but one of the main issues was that you had to make the ranked mode attractive to actually pull players to it. That is exactly what Epic did. Standard mode is now extremely casual. Game play will not be as fast paced, risk/reward was flipped, and the lobbies should be less top heavy (skill level). To make the ranked mode attractive, Epic implemented the opposite set of features as mentioned above. Harvest fast so you can fight quicker. Make that push so you can gain health/shield. Play against players at the same skill level as you. If both modes offered the same game play, you would see many of the high skilled players stick in the standard game mode. They want to have fun to, and for them demolishing lobbies is fun. So don't blame Epic. This is our cross to bear. Lets see where this leads us over the next few weeks.

They did it right by making it competitive only, especially with the arena mode(which im waiting on download to try out). This update for the game makes sense, because not only has the game updated massively since, but now it is more open and free for everyone to have a new playstyle and elaborate from the previous patch. Some play the same, some adapt and change a few things but all in all this was personally a good change. 

Some other pointers. The infantry rifle. I told you so😂. I called it out and said the weapon is never viable if its a projectile based weapon. Its basically a worse off AK/hunting rifle. Now this has been changed, i should imagine you will have greater sucess with the weapon. You should have slightly more zoom while using this against other weapons so hitting headshots against unconcentrating enemies should be lightwork. But i literally called it out that the game needs a single firing hitscan weapon, and also called out the infantry rifle NEEDING this game changing mechanic since the nature of this game doesnt suit projectile based weapons unless its a sniper or a rocket launcher. 

What else what else...

The baller seems to be improving i guess. Its good they are experimenting and not jumping to the vault. This is good. The baller is fun and rewarding if used correctly. They are just going to ensure there is more punishment for using vehicles. All of them have punishments other than this. I hope its a percentage of base weapon damage dealt to the player, maybe like 30/33%? Oh and they need to revert the trap change to baller drivers. Personally its like them not allowing players to get boogie bombed out of them. You need to punish them in some way and that shouldnt be considered a bug but rather a mechanic. 

A big one is the pump. They didnt do it correct with this one. A lot of people dont know why the oull out time is like how it is so ill tell you. Double Pump. Back in early seasons they knew DP was a bug, but they didnt know the answer to get rid. They tried many things and this was one of them. Increasing the pull out time to decrease effectiveness of using multiple shotguns. Hence why the tac and new pump have the same pull out time. Now we need to understand this is a bad change. They needed to reduce the time period. Now they have done this its likely people will still manage to shoot no pump shots(shooting when you can actually shoot) like a lot of people do now, and its likely people will shoot too early too causing an early switch before you actually shot. The counter for DP has been here for ages so just take away this delay. 

Now as for performance...well you tell me how it goes. 

Main thing to discuss is the core gameplay though. People will be unhappy and people will be fine with the change. I will say they didnt do it correct with one aspect. The harvesting rate. The two values in the game now incorrect and dont make sense together. They need to have 40% increase rate in core and normal value as of now for competitive. It doesnt make sense to farm faster for a lower cap to me. ",FortNiteBR

Listen fellas, We all hate being thirsted, right? But at the same time we all love HP for kills. I have an idea &amp; was wondering if other people agree’d or have similar ideas. Some might say a rumored respawn system might solve the thirsting issue, but that’s a huge meta change. I think there is more potential in small changes to HP for kill that could better the gameplay overall without ruining the core gameplay of Fortnite.

Lets say for the first 3 storm circles, you only get 10 HP per kill, the next 3 circles? 25 HP. The final circles can grant the regular 50 HP. 

Maybe 25 HP for first 6 circles, 50 HP for the remaining. I don’t care what the numbers are, I just like entertaining the concept of HP for kills.

I think this would prioritize killing in late game, and the beginning of the game would be a lot less stressful if less people are going to finish you off early on because that 10 HP isn’t as valuable.

But think about it, now that the settings are reverted in pubs and not in Arena game mode all good players are going to play Arena. That is great for us casuals ( Bots ). 

&amp;#x200B;

You see it's gonna be hard to get used  to farm for a long time again but at least you find a guy solo squading, killing you and your friends without even being touched. 

&amp;#x200B;

All sweaty / tryhards have the Arena mode with there own settings that they prefer so they can sweat with people at the same skill level.

Even content creators and youtubers who ""represent the casuals"" while having a k/d of 5,00 and over 2000 wins are gonna be forced to go aganist people with the same skill level.

Tbh after you calm down and think about it, it's a great update. Say goodbye for streamers making a montage out of no-scoping you and your friends while going for a high kill game. 

&amp;#x200B;

They are now gonna have to go against people with the same skill level and sweat. Which mean we can conga in peace.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: Give the update a try it's basically a ranked mode which we asked for the whole time. Only downside is the long farming time but that how the game been for whole 6 seasons so yeah.

##**Excerpt from Patch Notes:

&gt;In v7.40 we implemented a few Pop-up Cup settings as a test in core modes. After monitoring a combination of gameplay, data, and feedback, we’ve gathered necessary info to conclude this initial test. We feel it has resulted in an unhealthy level of aggressive play, diminishing other viable strategies. The following changes have been reverted in all core modes:

&gt;- 50 Health (or Shield) based on your health when the Elimination occurs.
&gt;- 50/50/50 materials dropped on Elimination.
&gt;- 500/500/500 Cap on materials.
&gt;- Harvest rate increased by 40%
&gt;That said, these mechanics have proven to be positive in our competitive playlists. &gt;All changes above remain enabled in the new Arena Game Mode.

Nerfing mats and shield per kill does this very effectively as a large majority of casual players like to go to places which tend to be quiet where they can loot up, get shield, mats and try set themselves up for getting a win.

Sweaty players go for hot drops and want to get high kill games, due to getting shield and mats per kill, it’s very easy for them to go from one kill into the next without having to farm, obtain shield etc. 

Epic have essentially made the casual mode unappealing for sweaty players and for those of them who do join will likely be killed as a result of their aggressive play style, creating a more casual environment for casual players. ",FortNiteBR

Here’s why: over the past year, Fortnite has come so far and changed so much it’s done wonders for its players and the gaming community as a whole. That being said lately I’ve been very nostalgic about the old Fortnite. When I first started playing everything was adventurous and exciting. Every game I played led to the discovery of a new spot on the map and even the old noises like the battle bus music and the skydiving sound effects. Everything about the game back then was new and magical and along with the recent lightning update and reverting back to the old style of shields I think it helps encapsulate some of what Fortnite was originally known,for, its pretty cartoony art style and the fun of just loading up a game to play to fool around in.

A lot of people didn't get to level 80, but in the end, just getting colours on your Omega is not so important, chances are they will exploit the ""edit styles"" more in next season

Every time Epic changed something that made the game unbalanced, they quickly reverted it. It's not in their interest to ruin the game, so no need to worry, they've probably already abandonned their mat nerf ideas after reading the feedback.

When you miss your pump shots, it can be you, it can be a bit of lag, it can be a bit of bad luck, so don't be too hard on yourself, even the best players sometimes hit 9 with their shotties, just make sure you have a back up weapon!

Just because your opinion is not the one mostly expressed here or you get downvotes doesn't mean you're completely wrong. Sometimes the most vocal people also get it wrong, the important is to always discuss and listen to each other.

You can't win all your games, and there are always better people than you on the map, having fun should be your priority!
It's okay to get bored and frustrated, it happens to everyone, just take a break and come back when you feel in a better mood!

I was bored and had some free time this evening. I got a message from a friend on this sub and we were talking about how he spends more time on here than on Discord and I thought that was quite cool to be honest! He asked me to check his stats and I said that 'if you used Discord more you would be able to see them easily using a command'! That is when I sparked this idea! Hopefully this is my way of giving back to this sub!

`SuperFortniteBot` is a bot that I have created. Right now it in in Beta Phase. I have coded a variety of commands in but will only be releasing one for now!

Run the command (as a comment in this subreddit on any post): `!fnbot &lt;keyboard/controller/touch&gt; &lt;solo/duo/squad/overall&gt; &lt;username&gt;`

&amp;#x200B;

Please choose one of the options in each of the `&lt;&gt;` and for the final bracket input your `Fortnite Username!`

I will leave the bot on for 12 hours and if I see that we are getting good feedback by the time 12 hours are complete then I will spend money purchasing a server (from my own pocket) and setup the bot with all the features to run 24/7! Please do let me know your opinions and give the single currently available command a test!

WARNING: This is going to be the first real test of the bot. Bot might go down during the night (unlikely though).WARNING: This test will end at 10PM GMT. If we are getting good reviews then I will work on releasing the rest of the features tomorrow and purchase the relevant servers!

Features List:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm playing since S3, and I’m average player, I have +100 solo wins and +50 duo and +100 squad, most of my wins was getting lucky. 

I want to know if any one notice the game after the few recent updated, the edit in building fight &amp; and the Merge of Xbox players with PS4

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is here:

I never faced an average player last 14 days; all of them are sweaty as F, especially in building fights.

When I played with my friend we face the sweaty players, my friend says he never faced these player in his solos and his other duo

&amp;#x200B;

So, I thought the problem is my account

I made a new one. I swear the first solo game I got 12 kills and I crushed them all, none of them knew how to build, the best of them build only wall. I get killed by one sitting in a bush. I continue spectating the game. and it is like season 1 all over again. They have a good aim, I give them that, and the best of them in building is sitting 4\*4 three floor high

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the long post. But I want to share my experience and know your thoughts about it

The amount of “TTV” players I come across literally just make me want to uninstall the game. I’m beginning to think the majority of players outside the pros still playing is little kids who spend their entire weekends and several hours after school grinding that play. I generally don’t come across casual players anymore. I mute my mic in every team game because I hate being interviewed about my life by little kids. I’m just ranting here to see if anyone else is going through this. I come from a big halo background and I’m beyond excited for the MCC collection to come to PC and for Halo Infinite.

&amp;#x200B;

OK this is going too sound crazy, but just hear me out, 

I had an idea for a new vehicle, and I wanted too really flesh out my idea too get a good grasp on how this vehicle would work, so I made this post too describe it.

So here's a photo of it, 

https://i.redd.it/0hqmm6xrkjo21.jpg

Alright, let me break it down.

&amp;#x200B;

**THE CLOUD**

&amp;#x200B;

So like any other vehicle, you can mount it. The way the flying controls work i'd imagine would be similar too how you fly in Creative as it would be the most convenient too control and easy too code into the game. 

The vehicle itself can only be found in one of 2 locations:

\-High altitude locations (Mountains around Pleasant, mountains in the Dessert Biome, Polar Peak, the Volcano, etc)

\-The storm 

So what do you mean by the storm? Well once its shown where the first storm will form, small purple clouds will begin too fall from the sky, these can be mounted and flown away. More clouds will begin the further you are from the safe zone, this somewhat kills the unfair randomness of being killed off by the storm. 

&amp;#x200B;

The cloud can not be destroyed however the driver can be killed. 

&amp;#x200B;

**THE RED TURRETS**

&amp;#x200B;

At first sight the addition of turrets may seem like a bad idea, but here's how they work. 

When you land a shot on an opponent it will do 3 impact damage, followed with losing 5 HP over time from the poisonous shots, this may seem OP but poison damage from 1 landed shot will not override the remaining damage too be done from the first shot. Essentially, if your shot twice, you will still only lose 5 HP from the first shot, but will still gain impact damage, essentially doing only 11 damage. The way it fires would be similar too the Quad Launcher, only having 4 shots before needing too reload, and if you hold down the trigger it will fire all 4 shots in quick succession similarly too how the Burst Assault Riffle use too fire. 

  
This could seem overpowered but here's the thing- it's like the jet pack, it has limited fuel. And when I say fuel I don't mean it will fall from the sky after a while I mean it will run out of poisonous shots after a while. I'd imagine it would have enough for at the very most 32 shots, but just too balance it- and this may sound insane- but you could go into the storm and regain shots in sets of 1, at the same rate of a storm tick. You could even decrease tick damage when both in the storm and in the cloud. 

&amp;#x200B;

**VISUAL EFFECTS**

&amp;#x200B;

One visual effect I had in mind is that the cloud will begin too fade from a purple too cloud too a simple white cloud the closer it is too running out of poison shots. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another visual effect would be that the turrets would launch bullets that have a purple tint too them. 

&amp;#x200B;

**SOMEWHAT VAGUE TL;DR**

&amp;#x200B;

A purple cloud vehicle that spawns at high altitude or falls from the sky outside the first circle, launches bullets like the quad launcher with limited ammo that can be refueled by going into the storm.

I think before the recent change they were balanced, as knowing how to avoid a spike trap and how to use one while build battling was a skill gap.

However, ever since they made them place without a build i find them to be a low skill, abused mechanic.

The meta shifted drastically this season, when they vaulted planes and boomboxes, and nerfed deagles and rpgs. Now, building is king and turtling is very powerful. I think this is fine, but now, if a player turtles, its very difficult to get into the box (especially on console its much harder to replace a players walls before turbo build) and even if you do, they can just spam the trap button and magically place traps.

With shields on kills and the ever increasing skill gap, TTK (time to kill) gets bigger and bigger. If you get a player low, you want to finish them before a third party shows up. But now they can just spam trap the second you get into their box. (Its literally the meta on console right now)

Conversely, a lot of times your spike trap will place some where you dont want it to when you are in a regular build fight (not turtling). And can be very frustrating.

If pressing one button can place an item that does an instant 150 damage, that player should at least have to place a build first, there is zero strategy in avoiding them now since you have no clue where it might show up, and it takes little to skill  mor effort to use them.

And the fact that we have purple and Gold pumps when the Blue pump consistently does 100 and 200 is just adding more Overpowered weapons to the loot pool. Im not gonna pretend that the pumps take no skill, but I think they do too much damage. In my opinion... Pumps should be vaulted and replaced with the Heavy shotgun. With the Heavy you could switch to an SMG and finish somebody off, and it was a great, balanced shotgun. Tacs are doodoo, but 153 headshot with Blue Tac is balanced. 

I know I'm gonna get mega-downvoted for this but I don't care. 
I get killed by a Pump too much now. Shotgun meta is fun, but I think the pump is dumb. There is one pump shotgun that does 95 max body, which sucks because somebody with a higher tier can just one pump you. 

The Heavy doesn't need a buff. Just vault the tacs and Pumps and bring heavy back.
And no. I didn't just get killed by a pump. But the Pump is, in my opinion dumb. The Higher tier pumps do uselessly high damage. 200 Health but a 210 pump. When the lower tier already does 200...

Y tho? 



I know a lot of high skilled players find this fun, but the pump is ridiculous right now. Why do we need 2 more pumps when the lower tier already does 100 and 200 damage??? I don't get it. It's just another higher tier weapon that we don't need. The blue pump buff was ok... But the Epic and Legendary Versions are kinda Overpowered. It does the same damage as a sniper, but nothing like bullet drop or travel speed. May as well just give Silenced sniper a shotgun Crosshair...",FortNiteBR

However, since it's not the only shotgun in the game, there's still an issue. The Tactical Shotgun is the issue. Nobody picks them up. They do no damage. The blue one *might* be a better choice over a green pump, but that's still a stretch. Face it, Epic. The tac needs to go. I'll put in my opinion: Replace the tac with the heavy and lower the rarity (green/blue). Even with the purple/gold pumps, The heavy shotgun is still a beast and its ridiculous range is a much better tradeoff for high damage than the fast fire rate the tac has. Its still-decent fire rate and 185/192 max headshot make it something players would actually drop a pump for. Discuss.",FortNiteBR

Lots of sweaty soccer skins running about meta abusing triple 90s and Pump/P90 spray. It's not even so much that there are players better than me now who are playing the game, it's that the mobility in the game has just been so obliterated. The addition of balls hoverboards and quadcrashers just makes it too easy for above average people to slide over and third-party the hell out of a duel. Usually the worst part about it is while I'm fighting in these painfully long build battles, I'll manage to weaken a player, and have that kill snaked from (and don't get me started on shield return per kill) or they suicide kill me out of spite and leave me weak and helpless. 

I really used to enjoy playing this game casually, but now I have to really concentrate and work hard to even get past mid-game. I have tried some of the LTM game modes and they're not bad but they also get boring really quickly, like if I wanted to play a respawn team based game mode I would have switched back to COD. 

I miss how simple and easy fortnite used to be, something about camping in a bush or exploring the middle of nowhere at the edge of the map was actually FUN. The storm was actually dangerous, not just in end game, and players had to strategize more before they engaged. Now it's just Kowabunga! whatever keeps these kids hooked, stays.

However, this isn’t because Epic dislike Xbox/Microsoft it’s just they haven’t made a deal with Microsoft and therefore Xbox won’t be getting an exclusive skin, Sony has struck deals with Epic and gotten  exclusive skins in return. So stop blaming Epic for neglecting the Xbox community, they won’t make an exclusive skin unless Microsoft pays them too. 
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",FortNiteBR

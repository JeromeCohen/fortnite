Can you at least buff it a little bit?","I find it really weird that a GREEN PUMP is within 8 damage of the GOLDEN HEAVY in terms of headshots. Its also a very rare weapon since it isnt available as floor loot at all. Here are some changes that I think would make it worthy of the title ""Heavy Shotgun"" and its current epic and legendary rarity. 

- Make it do at least 200 damage at close to slightly medium range
One of the main strengths of the Heavy Shotgun is how it has better range than most of the other shotguns and that's why I think it would be suitable for it to 1 shot people at slightly medium range.

- Make it available as floor loot
If this hasnt already occurred to you, the heavy shotgun can only be found in chests and supply drops  

Epic, if you are not going to make these changes, at least make it a bit more common and easier to find. I believe that you shouldn't vault it either, as it has longer range than most other shotguns and creates a new shotgun playstyle that can be useful to any other future shotgun that you add to the game

20,superiornerd19,1548725227,akuqgx,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/akuqgx/thirsting/,1,Thirsting.,"I like Fortnite, and I think it is a fun game. But I feel like being thirsted/BMed makes the game not fun. I hate it when I have to wait 10 minutes for my team to finish up the game. So I was thinking of some ideas of how to prevent this from happening. 

So one of my ideas to stop thirsting is if you were invincible from guns/pickaxe when knocked, but you would drop half your ammo and half of your mats. You would still take damage from the storm and knocked out time though. Also, it would be nice if you would die slower, like maybe if you had 150 hp and you would take 75 seconds to die. 

I was also thinking about an item that would be kind of like the port a rift where if you shook it for 5-10 seconds, and then all your teammates would come up from being knocked. They would have 100 HP (or lower) when revived. 

I understand that this item might be too overpowered, so I‚Äôm not too concerned about it. But I still want to see some sort of change to prevent thirsting. 

Thank you for your time. :)",FortNiteBR

There's currently an exodus happening among low and mid skill players due to the fact that building is so out of hand.

Here's the solution that will appease both sides.

Remember double pump?  How OP it was and allowed good players to wreck bad and average players?  It got nerfed with swap delay.

Epic should give weapon delay to building as well.  So you can't shoot and build in .14 seconds.  

Swapping to and from building should give players a forced delay similar to that of the shotgun swap.

Why not add Zombies to that mode?

Why not make the challenges easier, so those that aren't a streamer for a living or aren't allowed to play endlessly (my kids) have a chance at completely it.

76,julianmarket,1548717314,aktgxp,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aktgxp/goodbye_and_thank_you_fortnite/,1,"Goodbye and Thank you, Fortnite.","On December 27th, 2017, I started to play Fortnite. I launched it for the first time and was pretty excited for a free battle royale game. All my friends have been playing and had to see for myself what this game was all about. I launch ""Battle Royale"" and was taken to the lobby to see a Christmas themed background. Immediately, I was obsessed. I look at the store and find that there were  Christmas outfits (which I would've bought, but did not know the game would blow up). I call my dad over to watch me play my first game, hoping that he would like the game and play with me.  

I ready up my first solo and was taken to the starting island. There, I was able to learn the controls and got the hang of it quickly. I was soon taken to the Battle Bus, which at the time was red with Santa Claus as the balloon. I drop, not knowing where to land so I landed at the crates. There I was with atleast 10 other people not knowing what to do. I had found an SMG, but soon demolished by a Gingerbread Man. I had a sort of rush of excitement. I was in love with the game and so was my dad.

My dad and I weren't close, and that changed after I introduced my dad to Fortnite. We ran up duos all the time and we would have a blast playing together. I still even remember our first recorded win like it was last night. 

As we improved and got to know the game a little better, my dad decided to buy the Battle Pass for Season 2 with atleast 25-30 days left. And I went ahead and bought it as well. We wanted the Black Knight pretty badly and we thought we weren't going to get it. But with lots and lots of grinding, my dad and I eventually reached the Tier 70 Black Knight. And to this day we think it is our greatest accomplishment together. 

After a while, we got drained at about the middle of Season 5. Fortnite was not as fun as it used to be. It was finally dying on me and it was on my father as well. I stopped playing and didn't even reach Tier 100 Ragnarok. 

I now want to say my final goodbye to Fortnite. I thank you for the fun times with my friends at 3 in the morning and especially for making my dad and I closer. I intend to play every once in a while just for the heck of it.

Goodbye and thank you Fortnite and Epic Games. For everything.

* Thirsting is removed. You can't kill a knocked player.
* Bring back guns that make the game easier for new players (EX: Drum Gun, Quad Launcher)
* No insane building. You would only have 20 of each mat.
* Better loot drops. Improved chances for better weapons.
* If you have more than 10 wins (in normal BR), you can't play.
* More Ammo Spawns.

### How to Win

For **every $1 USD** donated to our Pencils of Promise charity drive between now and 2/1, 12:00am EST, you will receive 1 entry into the drawing. The drawing will be recorded and posted with the winners approximately 1 week after the charity drive ends. We will be reaching out to the winners no later than February 15th, and they must confirm response within 48 hours of being contacted or the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Contact will be made through the email provided when donating to the charity drive. All 3 SteelSeries prize packs will be in this drawing.

*You may only win a donated prize one time. In the event a winner is chosen and they do not meet the delivery requirements of a prize they won, we will first work with them to attempt to have the prize shipped to a valid delivery address. We will make every attempt to work with them to get them their prize. If no conclusion can be reached, the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Unfortunately, with the nature of this drawing and complexity involved, this is the best option. Additionally, all winners must be comfortable sharing their shipping address with a moderator.*

If I‚Äôm in a 2v1 situation and I manage to isolate a player from the Duo and I manage to knock them, I‚Äôm killing them immediately. This prevents a potential revive if I need to heal. Also, if I need mats/heals etc, I‚Äôm immediately killing your teammate as well. End of. 

‚ÄúThirsting‚Äù will *always* be a part of this game. Don‚Äôt like it? Don‚Äôt play Fortnite. It‚Äôs a Battle Royale game. It‚Äôs going to happen. 

I‚Äôm not going to knock Streamer[341] and leave him knocked because I saw a post on Reddit saying that ‚Äúwe as a community need to stop thirsting!!‚Äù. I‚Äôm immediately killing him, taking his loot/mats, and then focusing on the next player that I need to deal with. 

I have no idea why these posts are becoming more and more frequent. There‚Äôs already a generous 3 second delay before you can finish off your opponent. If you‚Äôre in a hectic situation, that time alone can be the difference between you managing to get the kill off or their teammate knocking/eliminating you. 

Not trying to come across as arrogant here, but ‚Äúthirsting‚Äù really isn‚Äôt going anywhere. It‚Äôll be in this game until the end of time when patch v500 releases and we‚Äôre all flying around on donkeys with RPG and Lazer attachments.

Let's take Lynx for example. If you unlock everything but the tail and the black colour one her, you should be able to get that in the next season. However, if you only unlocked stage 2 and the red colour, you could only get the stages after that (blue and stage 3). This way the skins wouldn't be default skins after the season ends and people who are 10,000 xp away from the final stage on the last day can unlock the final stage. Just an idea.",FortNiteBR

Although double shotgun is extremely powerful and not new player friendly, it was also extremely fun to use and now most players will be able to double pump given how the player base has developed. The only spammy weapons were the mini gun and lmg(also suppressed and tactical smg but they weren‚Äôt really that good). I guess the drum gun also counts(the last weapon of season 4). But these weapons (besides the drum gun) came with a cost. The mini gun was inaccurate and didn‚Äôt do much damage; the lmg had a lot of recoil and it was really hard to hit shots; the smgs were the strongest of these weapons but still weren‚Äôt like they are today. Now everyone resorts to holding down the trigger until they run out of ammo. Honestly, I really never complained about how ‚Äúdouble pump was overpowered‚Äù like I do now with the smgs now.

Another reason why I think season 4 wasn‚Äôt the best is because I enjoyed it the most regarding the story line and the great rocket event(the first live event). Season 4 was the first season to have a story throughout the entire season and I personally thought it was really cool. The blockbuster skin actually tied in well with the storyline and event unlike the other seasons that seem to be a little unclear on why they really were here. However, season 7 could change that because I‚Äôve heard some really good theories on the snowfall skin. It was also the first ‚Äúmystery skin‚Äù and it was really hype on week 7 when I got it.

In conclusion, season 4 would be a blast to play in today. No planes, no spammers, and double pump will be in the game. If you have any arguments against this, please tell me and I will respond.",FortNiteBR

I think a change to the weapon is needed. I've come up with 6 different ways to do this (some are more extreme than others).

1. Splash Damage Falloff: As you know, when you shoot a rocket at a target, they will be damaged if they are anywhere within the blast radius, which is an extremely powerful effect. A potential solution is to introduce Splash Damage Falloff, which would mean that if you were right on the edge of the explosion, less damage would be dealt to you than if you were right in the middle. It could potentially deal 100% damage at the very middle, and 70% at the edge (or something along those lines). 


2. Nerf Damage: As of right now, the Purple RPG deals 116 damage and the Gold RPG deals 121. A simple nerf would be to simply nerf the damage to 100 for the Purple and 105 for the Gold. This is probably the mildest way to go about nerfing the RPG.


3. Increased Reload Time: As of right now, the Purple RPG has a reload time of 2.7 seconds and the Gold RPG takes 2.5 seconds. Another way to nerf the RPG (instead of nerfing damage) would be to increase the amount of reload time. I think that if it were increased by 1 second on each model (3.7 Purple, 3.5 Gold), that the constant flow of RPG spam could be disrupted. 


4. Revert Structure Damage Changes: Yet another different way RPG's could be changed is to revert their structure damage to what it was before Patch 4.4. In 4.4, the Rocket ammo maximum was changed to 12. To compensate for this, Epic changed the effectiveness of rockets on structures. Reverting this change would make them far less effective on blowing up structures.


5. Supply Drops Only: Another solution could be to make RPGs exclusive to Supply Drops. This way, they're much harder to access and won't be seen as often throughout the game.


6. Vault: This one is simple, but perhaps a bit extreme. This solution is simply to vault the RPG altogether.

Hello guys. I want to  talk about the RPGs. Honestly it is overpowered, since allows people to deal big ammounts of damage easily. This isnt a skill-based weapon, but a weapon that requires no skills to use. Usually the strongest weapons are the hardest to use. But this weapon dosnt even needs skills to be used, and it has one of the biggest damages of the game. This is similar to the infinity blade, easy damage, easy kills. The RPG isnt that broken, since it has more risk, but i dont think its enought risk. So i propose to increse risk, skills required, or decrease player damage, because, as i said, it gives big adventages to the luky owners of it. I propose to ad a knockback mechanic when you use that pulls you behind, or make it weaker at close encounters, and powerful at long encounters.

(And no, im not saying its overpowered because some random guys killed me, i truthly think this weapon needs to be revalanced)

Hey guys,

Sniper Crosshairs for the Bolt-Action (and maybe heavy too?)

Waves in the grass

Old hitmarker look (It hasn‚Äôt changed much buck there is a noticeable difference)

Old default skin looks (The old outfits, if it has been turned into a skin, choose another recolour)

Old nighttime (Had a sort of darker ambience and street lights and lights on cars were more noticeable)

Old ‚ÄúYou were eliminated by‚Äù design. (Not to sure how to describe it but it was changed to a more boring look around season 2-3)

Old shield icon (Looked more like a shield)

Old player colours and marker colours

Horn while jumping out of the Battle Bus

I might add more to this later, but I‚Äôd like to hear some feedback and things you‚Äôd like to see, not big changes like wanting a weapon back or a POI, but small changes like I‚Äôve included.

Go into a lobby now vs. In season 3 and you can instantly feel the difference. Sweaties and Bots make up unfair lobbies and make the game boring for Sweats and disgustingly hard for newer/casual players.

It is clear after all of this balance discussion, a permanent competitive mode is needed to separate casual and try hard play.

As a ""sweaty tryhard"" player myself, I feel like I am pushing this game away from the masses every game because I realize how stupid it is that I can kill an entire squad and ruin their fun just because they are new players... On the flip side, I want a competitive ranked mode so I can try hard, play against good players, and re balance the game from a competitive standpoint.

I just feel like they sold out. Fortnite is everywhere, they have monopoly, stuffed animals, clothing, its insane. The full game isnt even out yet!!

&amp;#x200B;

Second buff the Max damage of the shotgun make the blue version have the max damage of 150 (headshot)

and the max damage in a body shot of 88 (current 74 and 77)

The purple would have  siginificant buff the shot speed is going to be 1.50 (or 1.25)

and reduce the magazine size of 6

but how did he get it.  
what im suspecting is that the prisoner in the dungeon of the ice kings castle, is a living and humanoid version of the cube.  


the ice king had found him and locked him up to use his power to bring upon the ice legion.

After disposing of the one other duo there we started looking for heals, only to get attacked by a horde of the zombies led by, you guessed it, a golden ice brute. We killed all of them and started to heal, only to have another golden brute spawn immediately afterwards. This happened again and again, till we had gotten five consecutive golden brutes spawned on us. It ended up getting so bad we just decided to rift out since they had bled us of a ton of ammo.

\- Been playing since a week after BR came out and have been playing almost nonstop since ( was 1 level away from Mako as well) 

\- Have 1k Solos, 2k Duos, and almost 1k Squads.   
\-   


Now, I find I'm a pretty solid builder( got good during Season 5) and my aim has drastically increased over the past few days. I went from hitting a few low dmg body shots to now almost every shot hitting the head. For some reason, I feel like I don't play enough despite playing for HOURS each day since I started playing! I've put in the time and yet every other player who played at the start is way better. Absolutely incredible. ( I do make it a point to win once per season and have been successful so far)  


I have good aim and am a good builder, I don't know what else to improve on. I get the occasional( recently a lot more frequent) good game but I always die one way or the other. Earlier today, I cleared out Tilted and the remains at Dusty with 11 kills and haven't been able to replicate it. I'm on and off.  


Anyways, I want to 1v1 some better players to see what I can work on. Who knows-maybe someone'll help me figure it out?

I really like this game I really do but with each update its becoming more and more unplayable and I've recently been leaning towards more skill based games like CS:GO and even more wacky and fun games like Team Fortress 2 and even Minecraft I enjoyed myself but I feel like sadly Fortnite is getting closer and closer to being uninstalled and just becoming a memory to me.

(TLDR at the bottom)

I want to preface this with a disclaimer. I am not in any way saying Fortnite is a bad game. Instead I am looking to point out the flaws in the system and asking for other people‚Äôs opinions on how they could be fixed or if they are even flaws at all. 

Second, I am not new to this game. I started playing in season 4, when it came out on switch, because it was the only platform I had available at the time. Some of you may say that that isn‚Äôt experienced enough, but I feel like my 600+ hours logged and over 100 wins would testify otherwise. And yes, I have kept track of my wins on a piece of paper(thanks for career mode on switch, Epic). 

Now on the the meat of the discussion, and what ultimately caused me to lose interest in the game.

I got a PC. 

Now most of you will probably say, that‚Äôs an upgrade, you can just do better now, and that‚Äôs true, but here‚Äôs the kicker: Everything I learned how to do by muscle memory on switch was gone as soon as I touched the keyboard. I used to get 15 kill wins. Now I‚Äôm lucky if I get 2 kills and 25th place. Once I realized how long it would take me to master these controls I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just go back to switch‚Äù. And I boot up my switch. And I launch fortnite. And I get to the lobby. And close the game. You know why? Because my skins look like blocks of color. Because PC looks so much better that switch looks like a gameboy port. And PC runs so much better that switch looks like a hippo trying to chase a cheetah. 

Just go back to PC lol?

But I can‚Äôt play PC because there‚Äôs no training mode. See my point? When I try to learn how to play, adjust my sensitivity, change my keybindings, learn to flick, try to build... I die. And die. And die. I get frustrated. I go back to siege or paladins or CSGO. And I don‚Äôt feel like coming back. 

Just use playground.

Against who? I don‚Äôt have friends who play this anymore. They got bored of it a long time ago.  I have whatever playlists they give solo players and that‚Äôs that. I won a solo squad back on switch, one of my finest moments. Also, one of maybe 20 total squads games I have played. 

Point is, and TLDR, I stopped playing fortnite because switching platforms was and still is messy. I believe a practice mode against bots or something would fix this. Just saying.

I don't mind dying a certain percentage of time to builder pros, but 100% of the time is just awful game design.  And me and my partner are above average players.  I have a 1.8 KD ratio and my friend has a 1.6 KD ratio.

It's simply not fun when all the tactics to winning revolve around building faster than everyone else.  Great multiplayer games need variety in their combat.  I should be dying to sniper Rifles 5% of the time, to ARs 50% of the time, to Rockets 5% of the time, to airplanes 2% of the time etc...

I've been into games for many years (37 YO) and my son picked up fortnite early last year and in the summer I picked it up to assert my gaming dominance, Which I have! But we have often had this debate of which lobbies are harder. When I started and he knew everything.... He told Me that console players where better and therefore had the tougher lobbies.

As I've been letting him play on my PC over the last 6 month's, he's begun to say PC lobbies are harder and anytime hes at my house and on PC, his console friends refuse to play with him as they say the PC lobbies are harder.

So 2 questions.

1. which lobby has the better players?
2. can you play on PC but join a console lobby?",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôve been thinking about this one for a while. Imagine a game that‚Äôs similar to blitz in that there‚Äôs a time limit and the circle is known from the beginning. 

Couple of unique aspects of the mode: 


-Staying idle/within a certain radius too long, you start to lose health or shield. I.e, staying in a house for more than 30 seconds causes your player to lose an hp until they get out of that certain area. 

-Killing somebody causes your idle clock to gain a fixed amount of time. Maybe 5-10 seconds? 

-Certain items scattered around the map that temporarily prevent health loss like a slurp

-Storm moves quicker and final circles come about much quicker (say instead of the 7th circle, the storm starts moving during the 3rd) 

-Traps, bushes, all snipers and rocket/grenade launchers are disabled. 

-launch pads, balloons, rift to go‚Äôs and gliders have a higher rate of spawning in place of the disabled items. 

-ATKs, planes, quad crashes and shopping carts have a 100% spawn rate

-Rifts have a 100% spawn rate


Any ideas or suggestions? I would like a quick paced game that prohibited camping/sniping. Always being on the move and the circle moving really makes for dynamic gameplay considering how it would be a true royale with everybody scrambling to get from point A to point B. The fact that you‚Äôll find a lot more people makes the immunity thing come in handy and makes killing people more rewarding.

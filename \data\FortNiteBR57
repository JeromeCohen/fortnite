You always had those guys that know they are about to die so they ignore being shot at just to get the confirmed kill. Yes there was an strategic/honor code but few people followed it anyway. 

The code was that you didn‚Äôt thirst while under fire but if you were no where near your team, guess what, thirsted. And if you thirst my teammate guess what, revenge thirst.

Before syphon every time I was knocked without a teammate next to me I was thirsted. If I didn‚Äôt thirst you and your teammate wasn‚Äôt nearby, I was using you as bait to get your teammates that are hiding in the buildings to come saving private ryan your ass. Then ambush them in the street because its easier to kill an opponent that way then try to enter and clear the building. Syphon literally changed nothing about thirsting but actually rewarded the winner of a fight. 

FACT: Without syphon the last team to third party wins. Without syphon midgame fights are an unnecessary risk if you want to win.

I play for wins not kills and I know how to play circle and pick engagements so health on kill did NOT affect MY LESS AGGRESSIVE PLAYSTYLE and I would beat better and more numerous players all the time because of circle control and not relying on mechanical skill.

tldr:
Syphon did not increase thirsting and
removing syphon did not affect my passive playstyle it just made the game a little less unenjoyable for everyone.

Arena DOES NOT I repeat, DOES NOT need cross play or any future competitive mode.","The main reason I say this is because all I see in arena now is a bunch of pc sweats that abuse M&amp;K. It makes it impossible to do good on console. (I‚Äôm on Xbox btw) M&amp;K pc cross play is never a good idea especially for a competitive mode and I have no idea who at epic is letting this slide just because fortnite is popular and the community needs to be in one giant big server no matter the platform. 

PC is proven across ALL competitive modes in EVERY game out there to be annoying and makes it to where the person using M&amp;K has a greater advantage over anybody else. You don‚Äôt see pc crossplay in actual competitive games like overwatch or rainbow six because it would ruin the game. This is one of the main reasons fortnite is failing trying to be competitive because it‚Äôs not built to be no matter how hard epic tries to force it to be. 

I know some people will, ‚ÄúOh well uh, Sony and Microsoft allow M&amp;K on console so what does it matter. Epic can‚Äôt stop it.‚Äù Actually epic can stop it. It‚Äôs their game and they can add restrictions to partially stop it but they chose not to because money money money money money money kids are making us money money money. 

Anyways this pc crossplay is one of the main reasons why fortnite will never go competitive because it‚Äôs unfair to the rest of the players on console who don‚Äôt have 100% perfect precision accuracy.",FortNiteBR

The past 5 games I have played I have died due to being third partied. I get into a fight, win it, and be at around 15 health. I then have barely any mats, barely any health, and no cover. I either get third partied or even fourth partied. Then I get shotgunned and die.

It is impossible to play this game in early game when you are constantly being third partied and you have no health and no mats to counter that. 

I‚Äôm not a serious player, I play very casually. This update effects every single player.

My suggestions: Give back the health per kill *please* and mats per kill. I‚Äôm fine with farming a lot but in early game you often get into fights right away and don‚Äôt have time. Maybe put in some anti thirst mechanic (every 2 health lost by a player is 1 health gained for you) to prevent player getting finished in squads or duos. (Just an idea).

Comment any times where you have been in similar situations and what your thoughts are on the update.

They hire incredibly intelligent people, house them in an environment with a strong development culture, and give those people all the inside metrics that the public doesn't have access to.

Yet, we have bafoons like Daequan say things like ""You can never cater to noobs because (vomit)...""

Um, every multiplayer game over the last 20 years, be in developed by Epic, Valve, Ubisoft, EA etc...has catered to noobs.

Why?

Because it makes financial sense to cater to noobs.  Developers don't make design changes to be nice.  They do it because if they don't, there's strong reason to believe your game won't make as much money.

TLDR: The pro community is selfish and unable to view game design from the larger perspective.  They want all design choices to cater to them and ignore the 80 percent of casuals/bots to the detriment of the long term health of the game.  Pros can be just as dumb as any typical Redditor.",FortNiteBR

After analyzing that pretty much 3/4 corners have changed over the last several seasons- this really makes me believe that the Top Left will be transformed into something. This would be nice because I couldn‚Äôt tell you the last time I dropped Junk/ Haunted anyway. Rumor has it Divot and Snobby will change with the progression of the season.

Well... it was fun while it lasted, such a beautiful game and cultural phenomenon Fortnite was... tis sad that it had to end. I am leaving this game. Probably permanently. Here is why... firstly, this game has been tampered with too much. I am a S4 player who plays console, and now Switch, and hate how we play with mobiles, whos aim assist is beyond any imagination. I hate how aim assist barely exists on consoles anymore. I am tired of the fact that the game is always trying to pamper to poor players by adding buffs and nerfing things, making bad players amazing over casual but serious players like me who have a life other than fortnite, and making Pros Streamers and Sweats OP. I used to get consistent wins, over 70 in duos alone, and 30 in solos, and yet here I am, consistently now being killed right off the bat every game. Every game now is pure chaos of build spamming and shooting until eventually someone dies. This game has passed its prime, and you all will quit it soon, as it is dying. Apex here I come.

Whatever a popular streamer wants they get. It‚Äôs that simple. And now that Epic is not caving in to the streamers and trying to make the game playable for the majority of people who‚Äôs job isn‚Äôt to play the game all day and who actually have work or school, the streamers are flipping out. 

I honestly hope the majority of big streamers leave this game so that the game doesn‚Äôt have to be a sweat fest and always cater to them.  This game is luck based which is the reason so many people found this game fun in the first place. Catering to sweats just takes most of the luck factor out of the game and ruins it for people who don‚Äôt get 15 kills a game.
The majority of people who quit this game quit because the game is just too sweaty to have fun. This change made solos and duos playable again for people who don‚Äôt drop 20 kills a game. 

Also here is a list of all the changes streamers have forced upon the community:

Siphon in regular game modes 

Burst vault 

Plane removal and nerfing into the ground

Boom box vault

C4 vault

That would be way too over powered based on how powerful pumps are today. My idea is that the delay that currently happens when switching between any shotgun after firing stays for pump shotguns HOWEVER when switching from a pump to a tactical shotgun this delay is gone.

Whever or not the delay applies when switching back to the pump after firing the tac stays is debatable. I think that would be a fantastic idea to keep the mechanic as balanced as possible.

I see pump tac returning as a very good idea as the tactical shotgun serves no purpose in today‚Äôs meta. This would be highly beneficial to make it viable again. Thank you for taking the time to read this

Should I buy teirs to make sure I reach level 100, I can get XP instead of battle stars? Should I wait till the 10 theirs bundle for 600 vBucks comes out?

Even though we're halfway through the season, I think I might have a shot since my XP boost is higher, I get more xp for completing weekly challenges (6,000 XP on week 6, 7,000 on week 7). 

Also most of my friends quit Fortnite a long time ago, I have one friend now that I play with. I can't find a full squad to maximize my XP boost.

Also, complaining about the material nerfing? Just harvest more. It‚Äôs really not hard. If you‚Äôre someone who is big on building and want to do well, stop landing where everyone else does.

Health on elim and more materials were great,  but you did without it before and you can do without it again.

Once they change it back everyone will complain ‚ÄúI hate the new update it‚Äôs way too easy to get materials and there‚Äôs no point in healing items‚Äù. A theme for this game is everyone complains at a change that really is not a big change at all.

Health on Elimination is bad for a Battle Royale game, and its bad for the core Fortnite Battle Royale experience. These games are all about randomness, and this mechanic only benefits players with aggressive playstyles. Its a negative for people who camp and play defensively, which is, I would argue, MOST of the playerbase. The top percent of players like it, and those are the streamers with 1000s of viewers on Twitch regularly, but that is a handful of people that play the game. IE the VOCAL MINORITY. I agree that mats should be 500 each and you get mat drops after an elimination because that benefits everyone. But Health on Elimination should not be a part of the core Battle Royale experience. People were complaining about how aggressive the game is now, and how the game isn't very fun for the less-skilled playerbase. Health on Elimination was a part of that. Since that was implimented aggressive players rarely had to take a breather to heal up, and lower skill players could rarely get a win because at the end of the game they were at a clear disadvantage. Maybe they had one or two kills and a lot of the time they were limping to victory, while the aggressive players had 10 kills and full health because they were killing everyone in the final circles, getting max health against players that weren't anywhere close to them in skill. The skill difference on its own is pretty tough to surmount, but its even harder when you have a non-aggressive player who likely is low on health and shields vs an aggressive player who never has anything less than 100 health and 50 shield, if not more.

 The other thing I would say is SCAVENGING is a core part of the Battle Royale experience. What does that mean? That means taking advantage of when a player gets out of a battle by picking them off when they're low on health and on the defensive. For low-skill players, this is how they can gain the advantage against high-skill players. Battle Royale isn't about the best player winning, its about surviving until the end, and since you can only have one winner per game you have to create a game where its possible for all players to get the win. With Health on Elimination in the game this discouraged scavenging a great deal, and thus made the experience much worse for casual players. Health on Elimination was a NEGATIVE addition to the experience for most of the player base, and it should not be added back in for the core modes.",FortNiteBR

And then you will probably say: You could have disengaged and looted up or got your mats back up but guys it doesn't always work like that, if the players you encounter are decent enough they wont let you disengage, they will hunt you down if you dont fight back and you will suffer the exact same outcome. In other words they shrink the skill gap to give the beginners a chance and it makes me disgusted when i put in so many hours in this game to learn from my mistakes and get better. Every sweaty soccer skin or whatever you call it has been bad at this game like you at some point but the reason they are gods now is because they wanted to learn and get good, and the same old players that dont improve aren't improving because they dont care enough to put in the effort.

But does he realise that he is not the only one who enjoys the game and wants to have fun? Do pros not understand that casuals are allowed to have a good time playing fortnite? The we are a part of the community just as much as they are?
We have been complaining ever since update 7.40 how sweaty the pubs (specially solos are) and it is mainly bc they brought sweaty settings into casual mode, bringing with it every single soccer skin. It was straight up impossible for us casuals to even  get a kill, as everyone you shot at would pull a castle out of their asses. It was unplayable for us, epic made a temporary change and it didn't work as expected. As hard as it is to believe, you tryhards  are not the only ones that matter to epic, and caseals were getting frustrated with how the game was.
And as soon as epic did something to favor casuals, the pro players, youtubers and TTVs flipped. How dare epic not do everything to please the sweats? Nevermind the tens of millions they have already given them in past tourneys, never-ending the hundreds of millions they will give them in the upcoming tourneys. The also want all the fun for themselves. 
Epic gives them a ranked game mode but nah, they just want to come on pubs and farm noobs so they can feel good about themselves. It's pretty sad.

I really like this community, but if the pro players keep acting like they are the only ones that matter the community will die. Because in case you don't know, it's the casuals who keep a game alive. If all casuals just leave, it becomes a game full of sweats, boring and campy and everyone leave.

And to every casuals just siding with the youtubers and streamers. STOP. It's time we've been heard.",FortNiteBR

I have really thought about the new variants and gameplay with the pump shotgun revision. Since the purple and gold variant came out, it has been a huge glaring problem in how someone plays the game from any point. From my personal perspective, a blue, purple, or gold variant pump in the beginning of the game has made a massive impact on how aggressive I‚Äôll play. I think that the pump has been a huge factor in why more ‚Äòcasual‚Äô players had a problem with the pop up cup playstyle. 

Here‚Äôs a perspective. Say I‚Äôm playing a solo (before the 8.2 update) I‚Äôm landing at Paradise Palms, I decide to go to the Hotel roof and there‚Äôs a chest, a blue pump, and a gold Compact SMG. I‚Äôm going for the pump, even if I can‚Äôt hit a headshot, I can guarantee a body shot for 100... a gold variant close range weapon isn‚Äôt as reliable as a blue pump because the start game it‚Äôs a guaranteed one shot at close range. Doesn‚Äôt this seem a little odd? That these high powered close range guns could be a deciding factor on your aim, which isn‚Äôt hard to do with such a wide shot? I get where the green pump is, where the body shot is enough reward to almost kill someone, but a headshot would be enough to kill someone. 

During beginning play, if I don‚Äôt find a pump, I stay away from someone I hear shooting one. The amount of building skill the average player has is typically pretty high. They can rush you with you having little leverage to fight that skilled player, you have to play so much more strategically. This can be decided by them busting one or two cheeky body shots to get you. While you must hit them endlessly with whatever you may have. 

This leads me to believe that these pumps that currently exist have too much say in how aggressive you play. If you get a pump, you want some shield, so you go try to get a one pump as quick as possible. Or play close because you know one shot can decide it. Now, I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt like the pump. I love the gun, I can‚Äôt run my best game without it. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where I can carry an AR and pump and be fully content with my load out. With all the vast choices we have for weapons, why is this gun the only one that seems to have the most impact?

It reminds me of the RPG, where if I got that in a chest, I‚Äôm definitely killing someone ASAP with it. Totally overpowered and properly dealt with by the developers over time. Maybe it‚Äôs time to take a gun that has monstrous power in about 75% of beginning and endgame fights, and take another shot at balancing it.

My idea of how they could possibly fix this problem, is they could go a way that would keep the shots the same way, but just lowering the overall damage, making a select variant for the current purple pump, while bumping the rarity up to gold. 
My idea would go more like:
Green:
Body - 90
Headshot - 190
(Green pumps can be found regularly as floor loot)
Blue:
Body - 95
Headshot - 200
(Can only be found in chests)
Gold:(would be now a Heavy Pump Shotgun)
Body - 100
Headshot: 210
(Only in supply crates)

Now I know some people may disagree with me. That‚Äôs fine. I just wanted to express my opinion for something I‚Äôve thought about for a little while. I hope I c an get some good feedback on my current suggestion.",FortNiteBR

Please discuss, Epic does listen!","So regarding this whole no shield on kills and unhealthy aggression. It's no secret that your partners were guaranteed goners with gaining health on elim enabled. And I think it's fair that epic wants to deter that because it's no fun playing a whole game when one or more partners just die immediately. So why not try to come up with a better fix than just getting rid of health on elim? This is my possible fix, let me know how to improve it. SO. What if a teammate can be knocked, but not eliminated (giving you health) unless they time out? This would keep them from being ""thirsted"" but if you take out the squad you'd get all the health at the end. Also, with the time out death, youd still get health even if there are stragglers that run or drop elsewhere meaning you cant kill them. I think this is fair, BUT people will get revived more often obviously. So, what if we increased the revive time, BUT make it so that if more teammates revive them at once, it will decrease the revive time. I think this will balance out the ""unhealthy aggression"" without ruining the game (for lack of a better term). Let me know what you think guys, maybe any different ideas? Or improvements?

From TTV/Youtube content creators, to the casual players, there is one notion that has remained consistent generally throughout each of these players, which is that the removal of Siphon rule-set has boiled the game down to an unbearable state. With EPICS efforts to appease the masses by ridding the casual game of the ""sweats"", they have ironically, ruined the game for those very casuals, as well as the ""sweats"".

What seems to be unraveling from all this commotion, is the true motives and inclinations of each level of player. What is becoming apparent is that players from every kind of level, want to be the ones ""pub stomping"". This mentality is not inherently a negative thing, but what is negative is the players who sold their opinions as, ""I'm just trying to play the game for fun and not have to try"" but actually had an ulterior hypocritical motive to their opinions, which is that they essentially want to ""pub stomp"" as well, but without having to actually put in effort. 

The player-base is never going to be pleased, due to the way EPIC has conditioned the players. EPIC essentially sold the game as a battle royale, but made the player-base blind as to what a battle royale consists of. Everyone has lost sight to what a battle royale is, which is to be better than the next and to want to win against others. It's perfectly understandable to rage at a death, but its the mentality in which you want to ""nerf"" and bring down the player due to them being better, that came back around and metaphorically ""bit those players in the ass"".

I started playing season 7 and don't own quite a few skins and although I don't mind too much, I don't like knowing I'll never own that skin.

The owners of those skins don't want players to get them either, why would they? They started playing first and had to work to get them. It's not fun to see new players get them when they ""didn't deserve it"".

So what if there was a once a week lottery wheel you could spin, and you had to complete a task to get spins. You can also lock in higher tiers of rewards for your spins. Spins gained through completing challenges, events, victory royales, etc.

Just not money/vbucks, never money. You'll get far too much backlash from that.

The losing slots can easily be experience, then tiers, then vbucks. Where vbucks starts at 10 or 50 which is already a negligible amount yet can mean a lot to the poor.

Of course, you could always hit the jackpot and score 1000 vbucks or legendary items and rewards. This encourages players to play more, especially in hopes of scoring rarer items.

Battlepass is already an incentive to keep playing, but when you've completed it you don't have much to do after than play for its own sake. If there was a lottery wheel, then you can still do stuff to just earn vbucks even when you own everything.

The negative downside of this is that it is a lottery wheel, it could be renamed but the core basis is the concept of gambling.

What this means is that the moment you knock someone out, you start gaining 1 health per 2 health damage they take naturally. So if you let them be eliminated without thirsting, you take the full 50 health/shield. (mats could be granted the moment of knocking them down)  

In the case that the other team mate(s) die, you‚Äôll automatically receive the rest of the possible health. 

This of course will only be applied to game modes where you can‚Äôt respawn, or if it‚Äôs not a solo game. In these cases it should stay as it was before.

I propose a new mode, to run alongside standard mode, for the sweaties to play in that should make them happy.¬† This will allow 'causuals' to enjoy classic mode without getting pubstomped by sweaty assholes looking for health/mats on kill.


Mode Name: 'Til the Sweat Drop Down My Balls' (working title, comment your ideas for mode names) -- This mode will track stats as standard, i.e. will not track your stats as LTM only.


The Jist:


Every player starts at full health &amp; shields.


All healing items are disabled, including consumable campfires.¬† Campfires on the map will stay in the game.


Once the bus exits, a 1 min. timer starts.¬† At the end of this minute, every one loses shield or health at a rate of 1hp/second.¬† The storm also begins closing in to the first circle at this time, and it takes one minute to close in.


Storm damage is 5hp/second from the beginning of the match.


Health and/or shields can only be regained at a rate of 50hp/elimination, or at a campfire already on the map.


Everyone starts at 150/150/150 mats and gains another 100/100/100 per elimination.

Bring back increased farming rates.


This mode should give everyone what they want:


Health on eliminations.


Mats on eliminations.


Increased farming.


Fast pace of play.


Sweaties win:


Rewards eliminations and overall sweatiness; forces the entire lobby to play aggro and punishes all the 'passive-playing casuals.'


Casuals win:¬†


Casual players and newbs can play in classic mode, where a variety of styles are effective.¬†


Surely, there will be plenty of sweaties playing in classic to pubstomp, because they need something to feel good about themselves in this life.¬† But this gives the sweaties what they what, and leaves classic mode as it should be, where newbs and casuals can work to 'git gud' at the game.

-Based on the Glock 18, this pistol can shoot 3 burst shots.

-Uncommon and Rare rarity (U/R)

-Damage:14(U), 16(R)

-This damage seems small, but if you can hit all three shots then it does a lot more damage.

-15 magazine size

-The bloom expands greatly with fast bursts, much like the AK

-Reload time:.75(U),.65(R)

#Switch Pistol

-This pistol is (loosely) based on the Five-seveN

-It switches between single shots, like the Deagle, and spam shots, like the Pistol, between reloads

-Rare, Epic, and Legendary rarity (R/E/L)

-Damage for Quick-shot Mode:23(R),25(E),27(L)

-Damage for One-Tap mode:40(R),41(E),42(L)

-Delay for One-Tap: same as Deagle

-Magazine size:12

-Reload time from Quick to One-Tap:1

-Reload time from One-Tap to Quick:1.25

-Bloom is higher on Quick than One-Tap, but still retains first-shot accuracy

#Automatic Pistol

-Based on the MAC 11

-Common and Uncommon rarity(C/U)

-Damage:8(C),9(U)

-This pistol does not have damage drop, but also does not get first shot accuracy.

-Magazine size:30

-Essentialy a medium range SMG, but I'm still including it as a pistol.

-Bloom slightly increases each shot

-Reload time:1

We noticed people have differing opinions when it comes to social media screenshots and so we wanted your feedback on this.

Current Wording of the rule:
&gt; Social media screenshots of original content from EPIC and Community figures* only, are allowed. Screenshots of social media comments and YouTube videos will be removed.

&gt;*(A community figure is defined as a user with at least 15,000 following on their respective known platform.)

What this rule currently allows people to do is let a user capture a screenshot of a social media post a community figure has made, for example a tweet from a streamer, and post that directly to the subreddit as long as it doesn't break any other rules.

We have two main options in the Poll below which will either remove all these posts or keep the rule the same with no changes. The majority vote is what we will take action on and apply any changes as necessary within the coming weeks.

Without siphon, matches feel like they've become much slower &amp; trying to play aggresively feels way harder. On top of that, I've noticed that way more people have been leaving the match before it even ends, resulting in matches where the other team has way more members than mine (or vice versa). This has lead to matches being complete snooze-fest, or just really frustrating to the point where I often just leave the match.

I don't know. Maybe this is what EPIC was going for, but it just doesn't make sense to me. Like, I get why you'd remove siphoning from the main game mode, but why take it away in the mode where the main purpose is to get kills? Players should be award for getting kills in TR, and siphon was the perfect method of doing that. Now all that ever happens is that I'll kill someone, and then they immediately respawn and come back to kill me when I only 10 HP left. It sucks man.


Also, for some reason gliders still take up an item slot &amp; spawn as loot in this mode, despite the fact that people have been asking for redoploy to return for quite awhile now. Really don't get why this hasn't been change yet. ",FortNiteBR

50 Health (or Shield) based on your health when the Elimination occurs.
50/50/50 materials dropped on Elimination.
500/500/500 Cap on materials.
Harvest rate increased by 40% 

Created arguably the biggest controversy in Fortnite history, but what people don't actually see is that these gameplay changes help make the game less High Skill Dominant, resulting in casuals and little kids to actually enjoy the game (which the game is actually aiming towards, just look at how the game looks and how censored the guns and killing is). I personally play the game dead near everyday and so does my nine year-old brother but our experiences in the game couldn't be anymore different. I have quiet the amount of fun playing the game while my brother constantly gets irritated by ""sweaties"" just completely stomping him making the game almost unplayable. I know my opinion will basically mean near nothing to the pros just wanting to completely destroy kids and casuals trying to enjoy the game but try to think about others as well. Epic made a mode for the people who want to play competitively, so why not just stick to that one and let the others be.

A solution could be that when more than 50% of a player is on either side of that building said player should be forced to that side. This at least makes it more consistent.

Meanwhile , arena mode would have no tacs  or pistols in order to try to reduce early game rng and would have no heavy snipers , rpgs , and clingers.

They throw tantrums, they know they appeal to millions of kids, so they tweet and tweet to get what they want. 15+ kill games isn't enough, gotta have my health, shield and mats on kill. What other fucking fps game awards each kill like that? Being good at the game should be enough. Showing your skills and ability to survive against all odds, even if it means you have to loot those potions yourself. How spoiled and lazy can you be? Besides, all these streamers who are bitching enjoyed the game prior to this sweat insurance.

Then you've got the average sweat who for some reason looks up to these streamers despite these streamers likely not giving a fuck about their existence. The thank yous for countless donations just sounds like scripted at this point but regardless, all these kids follow what these streamers say and that's that. Then there's casuals, arguably the largest portion of the player base who just want to have fun but feel they can't due to the current skill gap and while that is a valid complaint (imo), casuals can be just as toxic as the above.

It's a shit fest, plain and simple and frankly I'm at the point where I may just move on to another game. I pity Epic, trying to please both sides like this. Hopefully they figure it out but chances are there will always be a group that whines as people just love drama nowadays anyways. It's pathetic.",FortNiteBR

With that out of the way here we go, I started playing this game in October, and I didn‚Äôt buy a single thing until season 4, this is when I began to stop enjoying the game, i understand this is my fault, but the game trapped me in a vortex of buying things, usually because of envy, or I felt like I needed to prove something to people. Anyways, considering they are 1000000% useless and provide no real advantage, that was ridiculous. After that happened I began to hate the gameplay more and more. I realized that there was a massive influx of streamers and these people that will invest in these games with their lives and completely ruin it for someone trying to enjoy the game. Before this I could consistently get a win, but at that point I regularly got 20-30th place. Eventually after a few additions I stopped playing for a bit, then once season five came out I ended up buying the battle pass again, I didn‚Äôt get into a vortex of constantly buying skins, but I never made it to 100.  At this point I couldn‚Äôt even get one win all of season 4, and with this, history repeated itself. I couldn‚Äôt get a single win if I just wanted to have fun, and wins weren‚Äôt all I cared about but they definitely would‚Äôve helped with my enjoyment of the game, I didn‚Äôt want to devote my life to this game, as I had others I enjoyed playing too. But if you don‚Äôt get how hard this game became for me hear this, I recently bought Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, by From Software, and I beat the first boss in two tries, TWO TRIES, without looking at a guide, I looked up strategy guides for fortnite and I STILL couldn‚Äôt get a win, and it wasn‚Äôt user error, because I was doing everything correctly (I tested it on a friend who was worse than me that rarely played) and it didn‚Äôt work, and I didn‚Äôt want to become part of the problem so I just quit, played one match of S6 immediately uninstalled. Rinse and repeat for S7 and S8. That‚Äôs my story, I hope it helps those of you who still play understand the story and perspective of someone who doesn‚Äôt. ",FortNiteBR

We ended up winning one too which made It that much better. Gaining mats wasn‚Äôt an issue, people third partying didn‚Äôt even happen. And having to really decide what to carry in my inventory increased the tension. It‚Äôs really great to see Fortnite move back to where it all started. The game feels fun again.  Oh and games didn‚Äôt take long at all! 

Now, I get It. Siphon was fun. When it helped you it was a joy to have. But when It helped the other team, It was painful. Lowering the farm rate was noticeable but not as bad as you‚Äôd think. 

Really glad they added Arena for the more competitive players.

Here my thought. Keeping siphon out is a good idea, but they either need to increase farm rate at the current levels or bring It back to 500 and the eliminated mat drop. 

I like the current update, I think you have to be a bit more strategic, but i can also see why  people like siphon, that was fun too. 

One last note. Don‚Äôt listen to streamers. They don‚Äôt speak for the community. And if anything they just want to have the path of least resistance to killing people. The only thing they care about is what is going to make them more money.  So please don‚Äôt let them influence you.

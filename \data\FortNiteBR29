Season 9 as a whole has sucked for the 12 hours it‚Äôs been out. The map changes suck, there are only two DECENT skins in the entire battle pass, and the game is buggy as hell. Epic hasn‚Äôt fixed Tilted and Retail‚Äôs broken textures even though they were discovered over 3 weeks ago, and were acknowledged by the dev team. Xbox gameplay still feels laggy and slow, and on top of that, the seasons theme makes NO SENSE. Epic destroyed tilted and Retail in such dramatic fashion only for them to be restored within a week good as new. The volcano was a cool addition to the map but it is now destroyed in favor of a new poi that isn‚Äôt even half as cool as the volcano was. What happened to the island being destroyed by the volcano, which was heavily implied by Epic? What happened to the Prisoner and Ice Kings feud? Why the HELL does this season feel like nothing but a cheap cop out by epic because they couldn‚Äôt figure out what to make this season about?",FortNiteBR

(yes I'm complaining)

&amp;#x200B;

Point one: I can't find any and I've played at least 20 games today without seeing a single one.

&amp;#x200B;

Point two: Doing 200 damage within 10 seconds is kind of impossible without being in Team Rumble.

&amp;#x200B;

Point three: (point one and two included on this one) A single stack of shadow bombs will only be 3, which is definitely not enough to do this considering that they're extremely rare (in my experience) and are hard to complete. You can't even complete this in multiple matches easily unless you are extremely lucky, as you have to find them again and again per match, guessing you even deal damage that match.

&amp;#x200B;

This is more of a discussion, rant, and me plain out complaining about this. I've always not been a fan of Epic putting their new stuff in challenges so they don't go to waste. I wish this would be nerfed somehow, (yes, I know challenges rarely change) to make it easier on everyone. I really like to go for challenges but this one is just a lot of extra work that I don't need to do. Maybe make it either 100 damage, 50 damage in a single round, increase the spawn rate of shadow bombs, or increase the time to complete it, maybe? I hate going into Team Rumble for 20 minutes just for one challenge that I won't even complete that game.",FortNiteBR

They vaulted pumps, added tilted towers back, and worse didn‚Äôt nerf the drum gun. Sure, they might have lowered the drop rate, but it really doesn‚Äôt change anything. They are still too overpowered. Epic games said that they vaulted pumps because too many people were getting killed by it. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a good gun. It‚Äôs powerful. Not overpowered at all. Nobody asked to remove the pump, but they did anyway. Next, they had no reason to bring tilted back. The game started to get better with it gone since everyone was landing a different places instead of 15+ people landing tilted EVERY game. Also, the new shotgun that was supposed to replace the pump, is nowhere as good as it should be. It‚Äôs so bad that some people only use the drum gun now. And you know how that is going to go.

If you didn‚Äôt carry a pump in prior seasons you already had a major disadvantage in close combat, no other weapon is as powerful as a pump (unless you get lucky with a sniper shot). The pump made the number one spot of eliminations (26%, real numbers), and second didn‚Äôt even come close, the pump honestly needed a break from the game.

It was completely fine.,"Yes, I am fully aware of their Tweet but I'm honestly not only surprised but completely disappointed and sad that they literally vaulted the pump shotgun like that.

So hyped for the new season but honestly the fact that the pump is gone took a big part of my excitement and motivation to play the new season. I literally lived out of the pump. I couldn't play a single game without carrying one. It was a must have and seeing it go like that, and getting replaced by some other bad shotgun is just disappointing.

As a casual I was always in need of a pump. I won more than half of my solo wins (like 20 or more out of 26 in total) just to put it in perspective. And in Team Rumble some games I completely forgot other guns and lived out of the pump.
My skill level will be devastated by such a change. I honestly don't think I'll ever adapt to the Combat Shotgun. Its bad, it's like a tac but slightly, slightly better than it.

The Pump was a meta changer like the Drum Gun for example and such big meta changes in just a week is very hard to adapt. I honestly question Epic doing such a controversial vault.
I'm utterly disappointed, I literally can't play without it. Ilived out of it and seeing it go hurts me emotionally as well. I loved it deep in my heart and I'm sad AND mad that it's gone just like that.

I'm sorry Epic but I'm honestly disappointed with you today more than ever. I'm tired of this game. For me its no pump, no party. No pump, no victory. No pump, no... fun.",FortNiteBR

The pump was a staple of my load out for pretty much as long as I've played and it's replacement is not even comparable. Drum guns are impossible to find and whenever someone finds one they just clap because there are no other comparable options. And the new locations have like zero mats. I feel like that is on purpose but it sucks. Fights in Neo Tilted are just people spraying from weird buildings with balconys on every floor.

There was no update in history of fortnite which was as bad as this update. Removing pump shotguns was the worst decision ever. The worst part is, that the drum gun is in the game and there is no way to counter it. This gun sprays through structures so i cant counter it by building. Also no shotgun does enough damage to counter it. The map update and the battle pass are good tho. But that doesnt change the fact that the game is over for me. I will keep myself up to date, maybe epic decides to not be braindead idiots for one second, so i can install it again.

\- Whatever your kit was.. there was ALWAYS a pump.

\- Pump oneshot were low-key annoying. I got frustrated by it without even knowing what got my annoyed.

\- Finding a pump on drop = winning earlygame.

\- The pump&gt;smg meta was getting stale.

Removing the pump actually made drumguns LESS viable.

\- With the new shotguns fire-rate, SMG's/Drumguns are less needed to back it up in the close range fights. Making kits with double healing or sniper/splodes actually way more viable!

Also both shotguns now have very different play styles. Wich i think make for awesome game play.

So far i love this season.

Just the wind streams need a tweek..! (Turn them off by the 3/4rd circle?)

I've been here since season 1 and this has been one of the better changes of seasons!

Thanks for removing the pump, eventho i got really tilted when i read it in the patchnotes.

After 10 games of adjusting playstyle... i didn't know how toxic the pump actually was!

The pump has been vaulted. Initially, I thought this was terrible until I hopped into a game. Epic has done amazingly at changing up the meta from burst damage pump then smg spray. The new combat shotgun can work well on its own - if you can hit your shots - and the tac is now also good, rewarding close up gameplay. SMGs can be useful when paired with shotguns, but are no longer a necessity. Different playstyles are being rewarded. Everything is balanced, apart from the drum gun. It beats the compact shotgun. It is easy to aim with. It works in close, medium and sometimes even medium/long ranged fights. It oustprays the smg. It has 50 rounds. It melts builds. It encourages aggressive gameplay. Please Epic for the love of god remove it. It can't be nerfed effectively without rendering it useless. It doesn't belong in your otherwise nicely balanced game. (BTW this doesn't apply to comp... that sh\*tshow really needs its own loot pool and a serious rework)

Neo Tilted probably took around 1 year to build.

Mega Mall probably took around the same time to build. (Likely to be less)

Pressure Plant probably only took a few months to build. This is shown by how quickly the government peeps set up the lab at Loot Lake. Judging by how long it took for the excavation sites got dug up, we can assume how long it would've taken to dig/chisel off the top of the volcano.

(A note on the state of Fortnite),"Back in Season 4,3,2,1 and in some cases 0, most of us logged on for the first time. This game was new and unlike anything before, a battle royale where YOU could shape the world around you in seconds, anyone could go from the underdog to having the upper hand in seconds. This was engrossing.

Back then, the skill gap between the best and worst was incredible, most players didn't build a single piece per game back in Season 2 and this allowed those who did to become gods. Ninja, Myth, Mongraal even, were considered unbeatable, yet, looking back, even an average player of today would beat them.

Today the skill level is so much higher that the old game would be the limiting factor; shotguns that did 5 damage, 99 damage SCAR headshots, no builder pro.

Unfortunately, it seems that the developers disagree, shield and health-per-kill allow everyone a chance to play on after a drawn out battle, whereas now, we have no health and no materials. We have no one-shot-weapons apart from snipers, this means that being low health is inevitably fatal at close range, and most importantly, no highly skilled weapons, only ones that rely on luck.

I by no means am amazing, I have 1.42 K/D and 33 wins, I started in Season 2 and still play on Xbox, but I believe that the game at the start of Season 8 was the best it got for competitive play and peaked for fun in Season 4 and FOV sliders are a good call.

To the developers, please tidy up the game and listen to the pro-community above all else. Good luck.",FortNiteBR

I've used weapons today that I haven't used in ages. Before it felt like I couldn't even use the Tac because pumps were everywhere and they were just miles better.  Not playing the ""meta"" felt like gimping yourself before and now it seems way more balanced. 

I thought I'd hate the new air tubes but so far they are not so bad. I'm sure some bullshit situations will emerge in the future where they get me killed and make me rage but I can't see myself saying ""I'm uninstalling the game"" because of them. 

Far from it, the game feels super fresh right now. It always sucks to get your favorite item nerfed or removed, trust me I know the feeling and I understand some of your frustration. However I think the game is still super fun.

One item will never make or break the game. If that is your problem then maybe it's just too hard for you to admit that you really were way too dependent on that one item. It's good to shake things up a bit. After all we have been playing essentially the same game for a year now.

The pump shotgun is not at all overpowered. The reason you see 26% of kills result from the pump shotgun is not because the gun is overpowered - it‚Äôs because of the nature of the game. If I shoot someone from a distance with an AR or sniper, they‚Äôll build. So then following that, if I want to secure a kill quicker and without so much struggle, I get closer, where I can get more in their face and combat their building. When I‚Äôm close and personal, if I find an opening in my opponent‚Äôs building and I pull out an SMG or AR, I can hit them with a couple bullets, but ultimately they can just build again to avoid damage and then pop a mini. On the other hand if I use a shotgun (of any type), it applies the amount of damage an SMG does in 4-6 shots in one. I don‚Äôt have to continually hit my opponent to do significant damage, and that‚Äôs why anyone with half a brain would chose to use a shotgun in close quarters. The reason you see the pump kill most often is because it‚Äôs the most effective at applying instant that burst damage. Remove the pump and you will just see other shotguns take its place. The only difference is that these other shotguns leave you with less fun, more drawn out encounters. The guns that kill the quickest will always be meta. Please return the pump.",FortNiteBR

Epic wants us to TRY the damn shotgun because if it was added with the same time as the pump, nobody would use it and it would just become another double-barrel. People would use it at first, and it would become obsolete. If the feedback is positive for it, they'll keep it. If the feedback is not very good, they might bring back the pump.

I consider myself a highly engaged player. 


I play basically every day. I‚Äôve spent hundreds of dollars on v bucks and I‚Äôve farmed thousands more from Save The World. I watch streams multiple times of week and often catch at least highlights from tournaments. I am probably Fortnite‚Äôs ideal gamer. My interest is purely casual, not competitive, I play a lot, and I spend money on the store. But no longer. 

Over the course of spending thousands of v bucks and hundreds of real dollars, I used my three returns. Last week I was trying to preview styles of the Starlord skin ‚Äî because that mask begs to be removed ‚Äî and accidentally bought it. I am now stuck with it. Epic has no reasonable recourse for me to return it. I‚Äôve never played it and never will. 

The funny part is that Epic could‚Äôve had me spend that 1,500 v bucks THE NEXT DAY. And I would have bought more because I wanted Luminos and Dream instead I bought neither and won‚Äôt be buying any more. Why would I?

So I‚Äôm done buying v bucks and using the item shop. I‚Äôm done with battle pass. I‚Äôll still play. But no more v buck revenue for Epic.

But there is something I wanted to point out.  Epic said the reason for removing it was because of all the kills in the game, 28% came from the pump.  Sure that makes sense, but what that signifies is that almost everyone would head into a fight and immediately go to the pump shotgun as the weapon of choice in short range combat.  So it wasn't too many kills, it was the fact that it was too used. Imagine a game with this many options to get kills, and everyone only used one weapon to kill... the Pump had the most common chances of popping up. And in a battle, it was who's intenet would render in a one shot pump first. As for rng wise, now you would have a chance if you land on a green pistol, would you rather face this new tac shotgun or the Gold Pump? And with that said, this game is all about adapting.

Tacs are meant to have high spread and low range, combats have low spread and (actually way too) high range. 

Or to put it another way, if you're dealing with an enemy in the same tile, or one tile away from you, you should be using the tac as you'll be able to hit them easier and fire faster, whereas the combat shotgun is meant to hit opponents who are 1-5 tiles away (although rn it apparently can hit much further, so I'm hoping for a range nerf). 


The two shotguns compliment each other by addressing the opposite functions of each other. The combat, is in no way, a ""better tac"", its the OPPOSITE of a tac.",FortNiteBR

Good: Does decent damage and has a tight spread

Bad: has a decent range and fast fire rate

So this gun is by no means a bad gun but in terms of gameplay it's quite game breaking in the sense that it is very spammy and requires little skill, headshots are still a thing but aren't required to win a fight with this gun but it does obviously give that person the advantage, sometimes the tight spread can feel off and wonky since I've gotten used to the pump so much, overall the pump is definitely preferred, I'd say bring it back to replace to combat shotgun but leave the heavy pump out as that gun in my opinion wasn't balanced either and required so much less skill to the normal pump.",FortNiteBR

The new shotgun has a small crosshair which means the ""Bullet Spread"" is smaller , Now with Higher ping its impossible to land a shot ! Why? Because with the latency It takes 70-90 Miliseconds(Ping) to ""shoot"" the bullets which means 80% of the times you will miss the enemy , Even if you have the best aim in the world it would not help. With the Old Pump you could land a shot because of the lager crosshair so my only Choice now is to pick up the TAC shotgun now .

Keep in mind that‚Äôs still almost 2x more headshot damage than the Golden Scar. We‚Äôve all been spoiled by being able to one shot.

Do I think they should have vaulted the pump? No. We basically have two of the same shotgun now, with one of them being a lot better. Do I think it‚Äôs a game breaker? Not for pubs.

If they keep pumps out of arena/competitive play, pro players will fucking freak out. Pump kills have got to be like 90% of kills in those games. It‚Äôs so OP when everybody‚Äôs within 30 m of each other in the last circle. 

What I‚Äôm saying is that while I will miss the pump too until it comes back, but we have to adapt to the combat shotty until then. Hopefully when they bring the pump back they just replace the tac with it.",FortNiteBR

This is reasonable, considering it‚Äôs a gun that everyone carried in their loadouts EVERY game. However, 1-2 shots to kill someone in a jumping RNG battle just wasn‚Äôt very interesting. Removing it was healthy. Shotgun fights will be more diverse with the new shotgun and the Tac. And no more getting one pumped.

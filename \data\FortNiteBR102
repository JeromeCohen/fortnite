The marshmello event was amazing and as I was having a blast with my friends watching the concert I thought of a potential LTM where you could just chill with 99 other people without killing and talking to them through proximity chat and you could hang out with your friends around the island sort of like vr chat there would be mini games and things to watch like maybe the fortnite World Cup would play on a big tv screen or something.

I hear everybody talking about how good the event was but it did have its promblems. So that is what this post is about. Also all of the promblems I experienced.

1. No songs.
When I dropped in it was playing Alone. And I could hear it just fine. But when the next song started playing I couldn't even hear it. So it was very awkward just dancing and hearing foot steps. Now I could of just watched it in replay mode but.

2. My game crashed.

I was trying to mess around with my audio settings to try and fix the problem. But after a bit I couldn't save the settings a few seconds later my game closes and it pops up that error message screen.

3. It was laggy.

When I play a normal match I get about 120 fps. This event I got 45. I don't know if that was the cause of my game crashing or not.


So that was the promblems I had with the event good day.

I lost twice today because I got 1 shotted by a blue pump. I'm a decent player (3-5 kills per game) not the best player but decent but it's not easy to get kills when green pumps only take 2 shots to the arm/leg to kill someone, you dont even need to aim, just like in their general direction and keep pressing Right Trigger or Click.

When a gun literally requires you just to shake your mouse and click one or twice to get a kill, thats when you know something is wrong, no matter how anyone denies it, they know its true, ""just build lol"" doesnt even work.

As far as execution, it was done perfectly and that in and of itself is incredible. I can't think of a single time there's been a live event (in any game) with this many people viewing where there aren't any underlying issues with tech. 

HOWEVER. I guess I was expecting more? Maybe it's the fact that every other FN event has altered the map, or introduced new gameplay, I just wanted a little extra. I know i'm being selfish and greedy and that I should just be glad for what we just watched (which I am), but i think ultimately when the show ended, i was bummed because nothing really happened.

wicked fun show, not really sure it lived up to my own mental hype",FortNiteBR

During the event, there is going to be a huge build up to a massive bass drop, and this bass drop is going to have a huge impact.

Now, what it does? I have 3 theories:

Theory 1: It wakes the [Dragon Eggs.](https://i.redd.it/unrqbwtu90821.jpg) The bass drop wakes the sleeping eggs and dragons burst out of polar peek.

Theory 2: It causes an Earthquake. There have been tremors felt during the season and some people say they have been getting stronger. The massive bass drop might trigger a full on Earthquake.

Theory 3: The [something under Loot Lake](https://youtu.be/jLv2x_O-Er0) awakens. This is one of the most ominous things I've seen and that we never had any closure about. Not one word about it ever since loot lake resealed.

A player should not be able to stretch the resolution of the game to get a larger field of view (FOV) by editing a game file. If there was a FOV slider, then everyone has that same choice, but editing a game file is a completely different step.  A lot of games would ban you if you edited the game files to get an advantage, but this game is just cool with it for some strange reason.

•Are playing in a toaster with 10 FPS, where as every controller pc is locking in to everyone on 240 FPS 

•Are suddenly so bad at building that they would never be able to compete with pc players

• Are playing with two plastic nubs, that definitely haven’t been used for aiming and gaming for 2 decades

•Every pc player is playing with an air 58 on 144+ frames 
I play on a laptop on 1080 by 1080 on 33% graphics slider just to get 30 FPS

Overpowered aim assist changes the skill gap from being able to build and edit and position properly to whether or not your invisible friend can lock your scar onto another players head.
Because of left trigger spam players like Aydan and Issa have the best aim in the game, and it’s frustrating to play against that when you know it’s not really them aiming , at least not entirely.",FortNiteBR

Please refrain from using Drugs and Alcohol at the Pleasant Park concert later. There will be high levels of security there and I wouldn’t want anyone getting caught. 

My recommendation is that if you’re going to drink Slurp Juice and eat Mushrooms, do them *away* from the concert. This way, when security searches you at the turnstiles, they won’t find anything. 

I’ve heard there will be some cavity searches as well, so just be wary of that. 

I’m also selling Slurp Juice and Mushrooms if anyone is interested. Just look out for the Monkier hanging out at the gas starting near Pleasant Park. 

Enjoy the show! ",FortNiteBR

I’m sure we have all seen the vid where the guy spams it and kills the guy in the smoke .. the guy was standing still and hell why would you need to spam it that much anyways when smoke grenades are VAULTED  hell I even tried to spam it like in the vid on team rumble and NEWS flash every body it’s not as broken as you might think If anything it made me worse hell if it was so broken  don’t you think there would be ALOT more controller players in the skirmish? Of why don’t they just make the switch from pc to controller is it’s just OP. Like nick mercy said in a vid all these pc guys that have 100s and 100s of wins get killed like 1 time to a deagle shot across the map  in which aim assist Helped them out they just cry like a bunch of bitches.... they literally have every other advantage over console players and it seems like almost every pc streamer bitches about it... all in all ninja really is just a Whining little cunt that will cry over everything when it doesn’t even affect Him that much ...

That fucking gun is a hybrid gun. I'm going to be honest with you. The gray suppressed SMG is better then the gold P90.  

The fact that this gun is so effective from so far away and close up while being an SMG makes it amazing. It's not a drum gun, but it is super accurate. It does lower damage then a grey M4 at M4 range, but it's okay because it's an SMG. 

Remember, the P90 can barely hit anything from the distance you'd use an assault rifle and the regular SMG can't hit anything from that range, but the suppressed SMG can hit shots like no tommorrow. 

The loadout I use now is what I call the jack of all trades loadout. 

Pump or tac + green or blue suppressed SMG + Blue M4 or Blue - gold heavy AR. 

This way, I can shred through most players who come across me, and I am really happy about it. I nearly got a win because of that loadout. 

I came third and had 6 kills. I actually had some good fun.

I used to play your game very frequently. When I picked Fortnite up around season three, I cannot describe the amount of fun I had. The game was new and innovative, and felt like it had it's own special identity. The simplicity of the combat combined with the unique building system proved to create a fun experience that I and many others enjoy.  


I am sad to say, however, that almost the exact opposite has been occurring for myself and many others. The game feels cluttered and lost, lacking in the balance and identity that once made it so special. It used to be that games went smoothly and predictably, providing a fun and fair environment that skill and practice paid well in. It simply was that if you were a better builder, or had better aim, you won an engagement. More often than not however, the situations I and many others find ourselves in are extraordinarily frustrating, mainly due to the fact that it feels our practice and time put into the game feels almost meaningless.  


Many of the additions made to the game have felt like adding quicker, shortcut ways for newer and less skilled players to win. For example, the addition of Boomboxes. These provide a literal destruction of the building system in engagements, and plenty of opportunity for the newer player to not even have to try their hand at one of the most integral parts of the game. Balloons similarly provide a workaround for less experienced players to gain angles at higher up points, which again renders building somewhat less effective. Dynamite also takes away from this building aspect, and all three of these were added in Season 7. Now, I understand if you don't like building, but what many(including myself)feel is that we joined this game for a reason(building), and that these newer, cheaper methods of winning are destroying that reason, that identity that we used to enjoy so much. I would question whether or not downplaying the main unique aspect of the game is a good idea in the long run.  


Another addition commonly complained about is planes. While I commend the addition of something fun like a plane, the grossly overpowered nature of how they are used is problematic to the health of the game. In real life, planes explode upon impact with the ground or structures, which leads many to believe they should do the same in this game. They already have a mounted machine gun, which even with the bloom nerf is still extremely effective. A quad crusher has mechanics that make sense regarding destruction of structures and damage to players when colliding with them(the infinite flying quad crusher is a different issue entirely), making them fun and fair. However, planes having the ability to ram players, disrupt fights and change the entire course of the game are frustrating for players who liked the older, more simplistic approach you had before.   


In other words, you have attempted to lower the skill gap as much as possible in order to make the game more accessible for newer players. While this is nicer for said newer players, for the older and more experienced players this feels extremely frustrating, and is generally unhealthy for the state of your game as a whole. This mindset of creating items and mechanics that make it easier to play for noobs makes veteran players question why they would play the game if their time spent is seemingly disregarded by the developers. You can search almost any streamer on youtube, and find a video of them complaining about this exact issue. And while I am for the inclusion of new players, I feel they should have to learn and adapt the same way we did, and become better in a healthier way. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are many other, smaller issues that I could discuss, but these are mostly fleeting, and I commend the developers for their quick action on most of these problems. The amount of community outreach that Epic does is astounding, and as a whole they have created a wonderful community with a unique, intriguing BR. However, this game that I used to look forward to playing almost every day, has become lost and cluttered, unsure of it's identity, and unappreciative of the time many of us put into trying to get better at the game. While I respect the decision to try and include new players, I warn that many of the more experienced fanbase is going/gone, and this is the reason why.

I have managed to not get annoyed by people camping out near the dance stage or any other challenge location and killing people before they do the challenge. Personally I think that is a dick move but plenty in here feel that it is perfectly acceptable so accept that my mindset and other people's differ.

However, toxic teammates are out in force this evening. 

I was trying to do a plane time trial and started getting shot at from another plane. With three checkpoints left, the other plane rammed me and I missed a checkpoint. It was a teammate.

Mistakingly thinking the metal dogs head was the Llama behind junk, I built a ramp up to the head. A team map rode up behind me on a quad crusher sending me over the edge.

Running towards the stage, just before I got there a teammate, boogie bombed me (with boogie bombs I had dropped seconds earlier) and I got shot without reaching the stage.

Pc players encounter the least amount of controller players. Shouldnt controller players be upset about how OP the aim assist is because everyone in their lobby has it turned on? 

So i saw a few posts talking about this, so here are a few good points:

If they really nerf aim assist, they should do it only on pc lobbies, since no controller player said something negative about the aim assist. Its only the pc players, and if they dont like the few controller players in their lobbies ""abusing"" the aim assist, they should only nerf it for pc-controller players and console pc crossplay players.
We like it the way it is in console lobbies.

Another pretty interesting point was:
If pc players can choose about our console settings, we should have the choice about the pc settings, so:

-no more inventory keybinds

-no more fast editing

-no more custom graphics settings (inclusive stretch res)
and many more.

This point is obviously satire, but it shows how we feel about how pc players are changing our gameplay experience, even if dont even play together.",FortNiteBR

I lose my desire to play every time just because of how the game works and trust me , it makes sense. We all fell in love with fort of how it looked in the beginning now its just not fort. Did you guys have any future plans or discussions on bringing back the og graphics similar to season 2-3? I've had multiple conversations with friends and fills about this and they all agreed and thats just me being honest.. Thank you! Hope you guys take this advice seriously and please i want to know what your guys thoughts are about this and if theres actually any plans of bringing it back. Even season 3 or 4 graphics would look amazing the game just lost it touch with how sharp it is now . Thank you!

ADS spam is only a problem on PC with controller, as you get consistent 60fps, while consoles are CAPPED at 60, which means they  usually consistently run 30-40 fps, and even lower at hot drops. What I'm tryna say is ads spam is hard af to replicate on console, and aim assist is very weak on console compared to using a controller on PC. Remember, just like fire rate, someone found that frames also affect aim assist strength.

2. Let's quickly break down console vs PC advantages: 

Console: none. ADS spam still only really works on PC, because again, consoles have absolute shit frame rate. Aim assist is doo doo at close range.

PC: Hotkeys for build pieces, can bind certain weapons to certain buttons (none of that scroll through inventory bullshit controllers have), hotkey for traps, insane edits speed, whole arm for aim (compared to us controller players getting little nubs to aim), don't have to swith to build mode just to build, consistent 60 fps on a half decent PC. 

Notice anything in console vs PC advantages? 

Now, on to another topic. Why the fuck are PC players being allowed to choose what so called 'advamtages' us console platers get? Do THEY play controller? I think not. So why do you listen to them, instead of listening to the people who actually use the damn things? That makes no fucking sense.

I have a great idea. If PC chooses what happens to console players and what console players get to their so called bullshit 'advantage' maybe us console players should do the same for PC. How would PC players feel if console player bitch about what they should get for an advantage? If they choose what happens to us, we choose what haplens to them. If they bitch and moan about aim assist, I'll do the same for the shit they have, so here:

-get rid of hotkeys for builds on PC

-get rid of hotkey for traps on PC

-get rid of the insane edit speed advantage for PC players

-get rid of hotkeys for weapons and force them to have to scroll throughweapons as well

-force them to have to switch to build mode to build or place traps

My point here is if EPIC listens to PC players about what should happen to console, maybe they should do the same for us. If they nerf the only assistance us console players have, I'm done with the game.

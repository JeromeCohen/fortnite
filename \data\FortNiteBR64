A win should not feel IMPOSSIBLE if you don't play competitively. 
My suggestions.
1) Tutorial. We need a basic tutorial
2) Casual mode. A mode with mechanics that level the playing field without providing overpowered weapons or hard to learn skills. Pickaxes instant destroy player built structures. Single weapon per variety loot pool. Blue tac only, no pumps, Blue AR only, no AK, Scars, Etc, no splodes, no SMGs Start with 200 health and pickaxes do 10 damage. Traps set to a delay after placing of 3 seconds. 

(Alternatively, random lobbies could have different loot pools, pumps and SMGs, with normal building, Snipers and ARs only, etc. This would help players to focus on different skills at different times and learn how to use different weapons or get better at building.)

The idea of this mode is to level the playing field. This way, skilled players would find it easier to win than newer players, but newer players wouldn't have to learn a million things to get a win. This would of course be a little controversial but it would be in addition to a ranked mode and the normal mode. There would be no SBMM in this mode. 

This is kinda the opposite of competitive but I think we can agree this would be helpful to the state of the game.
I think this game is suffering because they are trying to make it perfect for everybody. This casual mode would be similar to the old Fortnite before competitive. I'm posting here because I think that we can all agree, whether you are a god or a bot, the game has so much potential but it's getting harder and harder.

We need a dedicated casual mode so that people can play to their playstyles without waiting for LTMs that cater to their skills. 
Let me know what you guys think. 
It's about the game though, most people who I talk to say ""I tried it, but I got killed the first game right away and it wasn't fun to me."" 
Even team rumble now has high skilled players now. We need a mode that takes all of the things that make a skilled player a ""sweat"". ",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

This season seems super sweaty.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a feeling all the non builders and casuals left for Apex and didnt come back. Leaving a lobby full of try hards.

&amp;#x200B;

Im not complaining, I played fortnite since season 2, no complaints, loved it, but I feel like this game has passed me by skill wise, and i dont really have any interest in practice building hours a day to improve haha, again, my problem, not the games.

&amp;#x200B;

They could really use a ranked mode, this is not news.

&amp;#x200B;

I just cant keep up with the building. The one area I could actually compete, is shooting. But the one area (for a person who grew up on FPS shooters) that could close the gap in this game for some of us, is pulled out from under our feet due to bloom.

&amp;#x200B;

So not really sure how to make this skill gap lessen...or even if it needs to, there is nothing wrong with an uber competitive game, but it will bleed players.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a sense that all the less than stellar builders and more casual folks like me, went to Apex, and stayed there.

&amp;#x200B;

The loop last night basically was as follows haha:

&amp;#x200B;

\* Queue up

\* looting a minute or two for another team

\* Engage in out first fight

\* Promptly get killed, and pass of the loot we found for them haha, plus 50 shield and some mats for their effort

\* repeat over the next 60 

&amp;#x200B;

I like that Fortnite has a skill gap, but man, it is a large one, one that for me and my group currently, that is insurmountable.

&amp;#x200B;

I could be completely wrong about all this, and maybe it is just the cycle for this game is ending for many, lots of new games out to play. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meh...I will be honest, i dont care one way or another, I have moved on for good, this was just a nice time sink while Im at work...but its home time now...so...you know...im out.

Fishstick is also shown but he cant be unlocked in the battle pass. I realize that Epic wants to make money but Fishstick is arguably one of the most iconic skins of the battle pass since it's a pirate.

I'm on fiber and my speed is 10mb+. My ping is between 5 and 20 depending on how busy an area is.

Seriously, why is this game covered in garbage common weapons: Heavy Slow Bloom Bloom Bloom AR, Scoped Pistol and Scoped AR that nobody ever uses or drops unless they've no other weapon. Even my friends are tired of them. 

Why are green pumps not vaulted? I'm tired going an entire team rumble with a not-possible-to-1-shot pump and every enemy blowing me away with blue or greater pumps. Speaking or shotguns, the pellets have gotten terribly bad. Clean shots and only 1/3 of the pellets hit.

Now building. Why is it when I play playground it builds fine 99% of the time. So what's your excuse with with BR main game? I have mats, I'm building same way and nooo game says I ignore your inputs and do nothing. PS4, using wired inputs and not Bluetooth. Or if I do build when facing the enemy and it builds the wall on my left or right but nooo, leave the middle open where I'm pointing at even while turbo building and let enemies get an extra hit on me. How is it my fault that game doesn't build were I'm facing? Not just that, I was just opening a chest as TNT explodes a floor below and in 1 frame since I watched recording, the game frame skipped me below the ground.

Bullet cancel still a thing. Seriously, I shoot someone as I'm knocked less than a second after, their shields fake flash and does no damage? I know snipers don't have bullet cancel but this shouldn't be a thing.

Before try-hards suggest I'm a noob. My kill record is 10+ and large team modes 28.

Give me any explanation why I'm wrong, why stuff like this is happening. Good feedback and bad feedback.",FortNiteBR

Wanted to give some more information on the Blackheart Cup this weekend and what to expect.

Players who compete in the Final Round of the Blackheart Cup and other upcoming cash prize tournaments **will be required to enable 2FA and link their account to an Epic ID.** You can do so by following our guide here: [https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/2fa](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/news/2fa)

To be eligible to participate in any Blackheart Cup match, a player must be at least 13 years old (or such other age, if greater, as may be required in such player’s country of residence). Minors must have permission from a parent or legal guardian in order to participate in the Event. All competitors will also be required to acknowledge and accept the official rules in-game before playing. Players must also have a minimum Account Level of 15.

I’m one of the admins working on the [tipping experiment](https://new.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b0am0t/tipping_creators_in_rfortnitebr/) in r/FortNiteBR. Some of you mentioned you would like to get some small recognition when you tip. Thanks to your feedback, we’ve added a couple ways to recognize the most generous supporters in a post:

* The top 5 tippers get their usernames and tip amounts highlighted at the bottom of the post
* Through the comment thread, they also get a special icon and a distinguished username

As one of the top tippers, you’ll see your name at the top of the [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b3rnku/season_8_week_4_challenges_all_inclusive_cheat/):  


https://i.redd.it/owhepr3x2in21.png

And in the thread, your comments will look like this:  


https://i.redd.it/n3s3elcz2in21.png

**How can I tip?**

* Click on the “Tip” button on a post or a comment (it is currently only available on the redesign, and only on posts from certain creators who enable tipping)
* Select the amount you want to tip
* After you tip, your username will appear at the top of the post, and you will have an icon next to your username (in that thread only)
* You can also tip anonymously. In that case, you won’t appear in the list of Generous Supporters and you won’t get an icon or distinguished username

**How can I become a verified creator?**

Currently, tipping is only available for a handful of creators. If you’re interested in signing up to get the “Tip” button next to your username on posts/comments in this subreddit, please fill out this [form](https://goo.gl/forms/gKcgAQOyDgKTjf2k2).   


We’d like to add more icons in the future. Let me know if there are any icons you'd like to see!

Ever since the Baller came out, I’ve had so much more fun on this game. It’s cool to fly around on and travel around the map faster. But no, all everyone cares out is making the game, “Better for us good players and not you casuals”, (Yep someone said that)  I want this game to stay fun and not just be filled with people who just make fun of others for not playing the game 6 hours a day. It also feels like people can’t adapt anymore. I also can’t stand it when players can’t adapt to anything anymore. I remember a few weeks ago, an update came out for Dragon Ball Fighterz where you gain less hp when you teammate is fighting instead of you. Sure this was a huge change to gameplay, but the community, instead of complaining, embraced it. They learned how to get around this and continued to enjoy the game. With the Fortnite community, however, all they do is complain about almost everything that comes out and tell Epic to just remove it. No one even tries to learn how to avoid the problems they run into. Basically, what I’m saying is that most of the people in this community need to learn how to have fun and adapt to change.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me sum up some things that are wrong with fortnite right now.. in my opinion.

I do play alot.. daily and still love the game &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Lets start...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Weapons.. are getting boring. No variety... Too many weapons that are useless.

   Which means you will die whenever someone else has a pump at spawn.

   

\- The Scoped revolver (useless)

\- Scoped AR (useless)

\- Tactical Shotgun.. really needs a buff or else its useless

\- Would be nice to have some more usefull shotguns.. something that can compete with the pump.

\- Bring the Tactical SMG back or the Drum Gun (nerfed?)

\- The Famas Burst Rifle gave some nice variety to the AR's. 

\- Why vault the Heavy AR gold and purple versions ? 

\- Infantry Rifle.. (useless)

\- Thermal Scope AR.. (useless)

	

&amp;#x200B;

2. Turtling.. is a major issue right now.. Im not sure how to fix it..(Desert Eagle build damage maybe ?) but there probably will be people that do know that.

&amp;#x200B;

Players keep building higher and higher. Maybe because of the redeploy thing ?

Im not willing to waste all my mats just because of some sweat that keeps building all the way up. 

So I will just go away.. because of the fights taking too long which also means.. I barely can get any kills because everybody already died by the time im done with that fight.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3. The Map... Not many new refreshing POI's and the good ones like Greasy Grove and R  I S  K  Y  R  E  E  L S  (it keeps removing my post for being about T H E B L O C K .. wtf? )) are gone.. 

So technically we are getting less and less good locations. 

There also should be better overall loot at many spots. Gives more reason to go there.

Everybody dies before the first circle because everyone has to go to the same areas because the rest is uninteresting or just plain bad.

&amp;#x200B;

\- The Snow biome is just bad right now.. Hamlet is stupid.. and Frosty Flights is always way too far from the circle and has no usefull things to offer that other areas do not.

\- Desert biome is great.. so that doesnt really need changes to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Would be nice to have multiple bigger poi's during the season added.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4. Performance.. Ghost Shots.. phasing thru builds and bullets going through walls is unaccepteable..

&amp;#x200B;

Lots of lag etc..

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

5. Thirsting could be an issue... would be nice if in squads the respawn vans would be enabled. Im sick of watching others play for 20 minutes 

if I die by some bad rng loot on drop/spawn.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

6. Matchmaking. Add in matchmaking for ranked. 

Keep a static ranked mode that starts from the beginning of the season untill the end of the season.. with divisions like in other games.

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I probably missed alot of things but please make fortnite and the map less boring. 

The new season was fun for a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

The only nice new spot added was the ship area..but it replaced many other cool areas.

Weapons didn't change at all for this season. ",FortNiteBR

(vaults, unvaults, new game modes.)","First thing, I absolutely love this game, I play it everyday and have a blast. Don't down vote just because you don't agree with me, it's my opinion.

**SKILL BASED MATCH MAKING:** At this point in time, their is a big skill gap between the community, when ever I go against anyone, they are ether someone who has no idea what they are doing, or a streamer, thinking they are the next Tfue, and are getting signed to Faze. You get the point, it's not fun ether destroying, or getting destroyed every time you play. every game, you should be put against people who have the same K/D as you, therefore, everyone having in the match having around the same skill as you.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**VAULT AND WEAPON OPTIONS:** IMO, their is way to many weapons and items that I will never pick up. Half of them are useless, and just not powerful enough, or useful.

Vaults:

Tactical shotgun: Who uses this endgame?

Silenced scar: Not good enough compared to the AK or regular scar.

Silenced Sniper: Bolt and Heavy are better options.

Scoped assault rifle: snipers are better options and it's never used.

Thermal assault rifle: same reason as the scoped assault rifle.

Rocket Launcher: If you have this, you have a advantage that is too big.

P90: Getting old, and suppressed SMG is better 

Scoped Revolver: Not worth one of my weapon slots.

Bush: I know it's a Fortnite staple, but, who bush camps anymore?

Turret: no one likes it, not worth the legendary rarity, plus it's really easy to get sniped in it.

Mini gun: OP as heck, if your low, and have little to no mats, say good bye to your life.

Pump (Blue and Green:) replace with heavy.

Dual Pistols: SMG's are a better option

Suppressed pistol: Not the best, only time you use it is when you don't have an AR.

Infiltry rifle: Worst gun ever put into the game.

Baller: Just annoying, really annoying.

Pistol: Early game gun that gets replaced the second you find any other gun.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Unvaults/New stuff I want**

Heavy Shotgun: Replace it with the green and blue pumps. Make it green and blue.

Grappler: Really fun to use and good in general.

Shockwave grenade: Great for movement, and fun like the grappler.

Zapatron: only a few people have tried it, it would be fun to some how reintroduce it into the game.

Smoke grenades: useful for getting out of build fights, and confusing the opponent.

Tactical SMG: Balanced, and to add another SMG option to the game.

Bouncer: this was probably one of the best items they have ever added in the game.

Double barrel: Tone it down to make it a grey weapon. 80/135 damage.

Bolt action: It was really good, better than the silenced sniper and heavy IMO.

(New)Uzi: Epic:18 Legendary:20. Extremely high fire rate. DPS:230. Replaces the P90

(New)Molotov cocktail: Slowly burns the player, Epic rarity, lasts 3 seconds, 12DPS. Burns down wood and makes metal weaker.

(New)Speed potion: makes you run 2x faster, lasts 15 seconds, blue rarity.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Competitive Game Mode:** 

On Twitter, Fortnite should make a straw poll, and let the community, decide what weapons, features, and map they would want in this game mode. It would make the community happy, and not complain as much.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**Team Based PVP.**

Add a team based PVP mode, everyone get's to pick what guns go into their inventory. Some game modes would be.

Capture the Flag

TDM

FFA

Domination

Kill confirmed.

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Remember, this is just random suggestions of stuff I want, don't take this seriously. ;)

Let me preface this by saying that the continued support of the game by the developers, the new modes and weapons, and the free battle pass are all great and increase the value of this game. However, FortNite has some issues that need to be addressed.

First and foremost, server issues. I play on console (PS4) and my experience with the game is mine, and I do not make the pretense of speaking for anyone else. That being said, the server issues have been... bad. Really, really bad. Issues include getting dropped from servers and lag that has become worse as the seasons pass. Building materials not switching, being unable to fire a weapon, freezing in place, builds and edits not keeping up with button inputs, and more all occur more games than not. It’s pretty infuriating losing games because of something outside of your control, and I and many others have had gameplay affected by these issues, as they make it difficult to even play sometimes.

Another problem I’ve encountered is one that is more easily fixed, and that is the high skill floor required to even have fun with this game. Most players in the player base are casuals, with outside lives that prevent playing more than a few hours each day. I am included in that category of casual. It’s gotten to the point where the amount of time you have to invest in this game to even be semi-decent is ridiculous. I understand practicing something to get good, but this game isn’t Dark Souls. I enjoy playing and earning rewards, but the core of a game is gameplay. So when the core game isn’t fun, there isn’t no point in buying the cosmetics or participating in the game modes offered (See The Division). As it stands, it isn’t fun to have 8 or more monster players in every single game (with each one consistently getting 10-20 kills a game) just come through and kill the entire lobby. I shouldn’t be “good” at the game to be able to enjoy my time playing and not getting turned into butter every single game. The high skill floor and corresponding ceiling is not fun. There is a simple and elegant solution to this though. 

I suggest adding a ranked mode. A ranked mode would fix this issue almost immediately. As it stands there is no way to bridge the skill gap between players, and a ranked mode would fix it. Blizzard did this with Overwatch and it was largely successful, letting more casual players have an arcade mode while letting more competitive players compete against each other. While the server issues are kinks that have to be worked out, adding a ranked mode will make the game much more enjoyable for the casual fan base.",FortNiteBR

Hard.,"First and foremost I would like to say, Epic Games, you have done a tremendous job on this game and the updates. Don’t get me wrong, not everything in the game is flawless, but it’s great and everyone knows it. I’ve been playing this game since it came out and I have had an amazing time and experience getting to be apart of ‘victory royales’ and “squad dubs”. But I have come to the conclusion, that Fortnite has become insanely hard.

I am not saying that this game should be for casual players. That’s not what I’m saying at all, this game is supposed to be competitive. But every time I jump in a match, someone is better at everything I do. Whether it be aiming. Shotgunning. Building. Editing. It doesn’t matter what it is, I’m always getting beat. I play on console and I go through edit courses daily, to no avail. I even try aiming courses, also to know avail. Man I work on my building literally more than I am in matches itself. Still, nothing changes. Nothing gets easier. It’s like the flow of the game isn’t there anymore, I do not really know how to describe it. 

I know this is a rant, and people will say practice and practice or you’re just a shit player. And that is fine, I can accept that. I just want to be able to enjoy this beautiful and amazing game again is all. Sorry guys, just had to get this off my chest, hopefully I’m not alone!",FortNiteBR

This game has given me so many fun moments and great times and I remember my first win, so adrenaline pumped. I’ve had great times exploring the (sometimes) fun buggy nature of the game. Flying across the map with a shopping cart, or T-posing while I glide in the sky.  Everyday I would play this game with a smile on my face. Every time I booted up the game I would smile a little bit.  And my friends and I would laugh and try to play competitive but mess up and just laugh it off.

However, this game has changed, and not for the better.

Now I boot up the game out of sheer addiction and don’t even play it. My friends have moved on to other games. Playing makes me frustrated now.getting one-pumped while my opponent uses all of his materials just trying to get the high ground, isn’t fun. The buggy nature of the game isn’t fun anymore, it’s actually annoying. My shots hitting for nothing, or my opponent clipping in my walls. I’m frustrated with this game and I cannot play it any more. Coming back isn’t an option because it’s way to competitive. Epic wont listen, so I’m leaving.

Goodbye, Fun times
Goodbye, Bugs
Goodbye, Toxic Community
And most importantly
Goodbye, Sweats. You have officially ruined the game for me because everyone else is massive leagues ahead of me despite me practicing and playing since season 2.

I might miss this game, and think about in the future.

I’d like to propose an idea that would limit “thirsting” as well as make it more difficult for teams to third party.
In a recent update it was made so that an extra 50 health whenever a player you knocked down was eliminated. While this made third partying more difficult, it also made the rates of thirsting increase. Nobody enjoys being thirsted. The purpose in playing duos or squads is to play with comrades, and thirsting goes against this idea.
The idea I’d like to propose would make it so that the additional 50 Health would only be given if the entire team was eliminated, or the knocked down player “bleeds out”. If the knocked down player is shot in order quicken the “bleeding out” process, then the player who knocked them down would not receive the extra 50 Health when the knocked player is eliminated.
Thirsting has always been an issue, but not more than ever. It’s a factor that causes players to leave the Fortnite community and move on to other games. This solution could very well bring back old players, as well as new ones.

(note the premise of the post is the lack of fun due to the presence of overskilled players, so consider this the TL:DR, but note that this alone won't be much to base a valid argument.)

Today I felt a sudden disconnection to the game, more so than usual. It has changed so much from it's roots, It's barely comparible. The point is that the game has lost it's fun value.

I do not want to play a single minded game where I face 20 kill players every endgame. Wether it be camping or fighting, it always ends in disappointment. Nothing I, or my mates do ever works. And in the 1 in a 100 that we do win a game, we do have a spark of joy, but just that spark in the moment.

I'm an average player. I'm used to using a controller on pc, I really can't handle all the keybinds on pc (don't undermine the entire post just because I mentioned this point, I mentioned this so that people can understand the skill cap I'm at vs what I go up against. I really can't get used to a keyboard, I'm ok at apex with a keyboard but only because I strictly began with it.)

I usually play with my other mate who is worse at the game than me by a bit. But it doesn't keep me from playing. The only thing keeping us tied to the game are the memes we constantly create and overuse. Today I created a new one : ""Get shat on"" then default dance, and we laughed our asses off. I didn't get to use it once on players bc I'm the one who more often dies first due to a sweaty boi on my ass in the beginning.

But enough about memes, the whole point is that the game is just a training ground for these sweats, preparing them for the 100k prize scrim. NO MAN! I don't want it anymore, and so do you. Let's keep suggesting things so that maybe epic can actually do something about it instead of adding a mini cannon. :)

Squads are the same, and I play with mates who use stretched (which somehow is the only way they are better). We still get shat on by soccer skins (it's always fuckin soccer skins).

And you know what pisses us off the most? We go into a match, loot a large place completely, run from 1 side of the map to the other, all game, no player in sight. then all of a sudden you hear a distant ""vvvvvvvvvvvvVVVVVVVVVVV"" and then bam, 1 tap and finished. And If we do end up winning, we are too weak and end up getting pressured by 3 oncoming teams from all directions.

The whole game, not a single person, then we meet the entire fucking server. This game is honestly a clusterfuck and it'd playerbase is too different to ignore now. You, the community, need to decide what is the best course of action for Epic to take (without getting triggered and no backsies) for the game to move in a direction that fits and welcomes all.

But now with a sneak attack by ""the other free to play battle royale that I can't mention because auto mod"" and poor design decisions by Epic it's questionable if Fortnite will continue to remain popular. 

This worries me, because I love Fortnite, but at the same time i feel Epic is getting what is coming to them. Fortnite is not an E-sport, but the staff at Epic is delusional and thinks the contrary. But with bloom as a mechanic and RNG loot from chests Fortnite will never be competitively viable. Yet the fans also share in the delusion, and like the Super Smash Brothers community try to make it work as a competitive game when the mechanics don't match.

Creatively they're on a sinking ship. And instead of being inspired and interesting, Epic is copying gameplay from other games and rehashing old tired concepts. The battle pass has suffered since season 4 and continues to provide less value with each season, combined with the fatigue of unlocking additional styles and options the battle pass is more work and less reward. That's not fun and it's starting to become more and more of a problem. 

In addition Epic has a very bad habit of ""fixing"" problems that weren't problems before. And ignoring actual legit problems. Did anyone ask for the character models to do a jumping out animation in the locker when selecting contrails? I didn't. It was fine before. But Epic ""fixed"" it. And now it's an annoyance.

All in all. I don't think Fortnite will recover. A lot hinges on season 9. If the battle pass is just mediocre next season, and the theme for season 9 not interesting or fresh, I'll quit Fortnite. Because Epic isn't trying. They sit there at headquarters and circlejerk each other, oblivious to the reality that they were lucky to be so successful to begin with. The OGs have already left because Fortnite has jumped the shark and has become a parody of itself.

Me and my mate have been playing since season 1. Up until season 3 we always had fun when we got on especially on high explosives. Literally just us camping on jail and then sploding the last guys and winning. Man, those where the days.

Today is just a bland slate. Fortnite can be described in a few words ; Sweat, shotguns and spam. That's all it is! It's so bland that I despise going on to play with my mates anymore, so much so that I got the conga today and I don't even bother going for the challenges ((73,52,52) progress).

My problem? Of course it's the constant sweat to live. I'm sorry, I did not sign up for a €100k match and neither did you. I signed up for a fun immersive and diverse game where I can do whatever the fuck I want and still have fun even if I lose.

&amp;#x200B;

i mean yeah, Epic want to keep it on a rotation with the other respawn LTMs, and that's ok, but lets be honest here, Food Fight is the least favorite of the people, most people that plays respawn LTMs didn't liked Food Fight since the game mode got released, and Disco Domination is pretty good, the problem is that barely anyone actually captures the objectives, most of the time is just a shit show on the middle of the circle, so that mode is almost uneccesary, unless they change it again",FortNiteBR

*NOTE: I have played Fortnite myself for a long time and do not mean to offend ANYONE*



Gameplay Instability- The matches have become so unstable that you can't even play anymore. They have added SO many disruptive items such as:
Boombox
Planes
Many more!

Vaulting Obsession-
Also, Epic Games must have a very insecure manager because they have vaulted too much items.
One day, they vault a weapon. That's ok.
The NEXT WEEK, THEY VAULT AGAIN! EPIC HAS A SERIOS OBSESSION WITH VAULTING! Even with the only ACTUALLY good weapons. It's like Epic is PUSHING us to use the TERRIBLE heavy sniper, or the TRASH ARs!!!!!!!! 😡😡😡😡😡 ( The reason I say the h. Sniper is terrible is because it has a big reload delay.)

Popularity-
Cringey 12 yr old kids, ignorant teens, addicts, and ""been there since day 1"" fans are the only people who STILL play Fortnite.

The general public claims that after AN ENTIRE YEAR AND A HALF, Fortnite is STILL alive!
NO! Epic Games has done SO many things to RUIN it, NOT PROMOTE IT!



*Resume:
Fortnite is not the same anymore. If not already, it will die*

The best thing to do would be to remove an awful lot of stuff: grapplers, balloons, rift to gos, vehicles, glider redeploy, etc. These should only be in ltms where you can respawn, otherwise they ruin the game and should not be in regular game modes. If they were to get rid of these they should also buff mats to 750 as well.

While I mainly focus on skins, backblings, and emotes, I also have fun checking out the occasional sick glider or harvesting tool (if the bashing noise is affable enough). Putting some of my week's extra funds towards a V-Buck fillup is one of my favorite feelings, and seeing something I'm drawn to in-store has been a delight almost equal in fun to the participation of the game itself.

But the last few months... don't get me wrong, some of the items are fantastic and I've had the same joy. But it happens less. Significantly less. It was happening a few times a week and now I'm lucky if I get my ""once every seven days"" fix. I don't overbuy. I have around 90+ skins in my Favorites including Battle Pass ones and Bundle ones, so it's not like I'm out of choices... I just feel like the following problems have kept my money in my wallet rather than the siphon effect that Epic would like. They are:

1. Too many ""Less than 30 days ago"" returns. Sometimes items that were last seen 12, 14, 19 days ago come back even. Why? If people weren't interested then, there's no reason re-generating hype now would make any sense.

2. Spacing out of sets instead of utilizing slots. I have no idea why they choose to put the skins, a glider, and a harvesting tool all into the three large box slots when they could sell more items. With how many items are in the 100 Days or More list, I don't see why they can't another set in there as opposed to filling up that shelf. Just make the image cycle through faster if you want people to see them all in the one square.

3. A rise of ""masked/faceless"" skins. I like mascots, I like unique heads on outfits... but there have been so many outfits that have no facial expressions. As someone who likes emotes, I'm less into the skins that wear helmets, gear, special masks, etc. I know we're getting styles for many skins and this is a great incentive to help make them better. But I notice the last couple of patch updates had more of these ""faceless"" skins and I think it's kinda boring

These are just my personal reasons I've bought less, but the first 2 out of the 3 are definitely more universal in the sense that we could all benefit from some tweaking. Thank you for reading.",FortNiteBR

The flintlock pistol sounds interesting to be honest. I have no complaints about the flintlock pistol yet because i've not used it yet or seen anyone use it yet. One of the reasons why I'm pissed off at this game is because they brought back impulse grenades. Epic Games adds building to Fortnite but they act like it shouldn't be in the game. They nerf the structures so that the structures are stupidly weak so you get shot down really easily. If you are a good builder like me and you have a full squad just spamming your structures down there is nothing you can do. It is like Epic Games makes it easier for bad players to do well and all the good players get shitted on all the time. Then the game adds impulses. I just know that everytime I'm going to get into a build fight I'm going to get impulsed off every time. I don't understand why Epic Games added the impulses back. It is like Epic Games has completedly given up with the game. Epic Games could have vaulted the balloons because either you don't know where you're being shot from because how the fuck are you meant to know if someone is above you. Or you just get lasered out of the sky instantly without being able to think. The dynamite is literally stupid. You can hardly throw it very far and if you throw tons of dynamite around a build all at once and it blows up the person in the build can't even build because the explosion sets off and breaks the build before it's even placed and you're just dead being unable to do anything. Or Epic Games could have vaulted the scoped AR or thermal AR instead of unvaulting impulses because no one uses the scoped ARs or thermal ARs because they're trash. Then Epic Games doesn't release a single bug fix when Fortnite is literally the buggiest game on the planet rn (Other than Sonic 06). You shoot someone point blanc in the face from 0m away with a Legendary Pump Shotgun for 28 and then a default shoots you with a blue pump for 200. It has happened to me literally 600 times and Epic Games doesn't fix that. Bloom is a massive issue and it happens with every gun including, ARs, Shotguns, SMGs etc. Epic Games doesn't fix that. People are still getting shot through walls. Last week I got shot through a wall twice and the person had the break the wall to get to my loot when that was the wall that I got shot through. And yesterday I was playing One Shot mode and I was being attacked by a hamster ball so I built a wall to protect myself and the hamster ball went through the wall and killed me. When a looked to see the wall in spectator mode the wall was still fully intact. There are so many stupid bugs that Epic Games needs to fix. There are probably hundreds and Epic Games doesn't release a single bug in this update. Epic Games are a bunch of retards when it comes to Fortnite. An 16 year old on his own could probably do a better job than the whole Epic Games company.

Let me quickly say that this is not meant to offend anyone. I'm just pointing out the obvious, and it's something that's plaguing this community. I see so many posts about OG things, and it's honestly just spam at this point.

Okay, what does 'OG' mean? Well, it's what long-time players are calling everything from like seasons 0-3, before there was a huge growth in the player base. There's 'OG' skins, the 'OG' map, and weapons. There's nothing wrong with that?

Actually, there is. 

Fortnite has only been out for a year and a half. That's not even long enough to call something OG. There's things in games like TF2 and CS:GO that are OG, as those games have been around for years and years. Your great grandpa is an OG, but your one year old cousin isn't. Get it?

So, all these posts are about ""Can my OG *insert random season 3 skin here* get its own style because I bought it first?"" 

Or ""Epic, don't sell my skin again! It's rare!"" 

Or ""Can we bring back the OG map?""

It's gotta stop, guys. It's childish. It's a game based on constant changes and a store that's constantly fluctuating, meaning that the map won't ever be the same (which is for the better, as it doesn't get stale) and skins are going to reappear in the shop. Who cares if others get the same skin as you? If you like it, it shouldn't matter. I like skins that I know damn well thousands of others have, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the game. This is a Battle Royale game, dammit. Not a market or whatever. When you ask for your skin to be special, your coming off as someone who believes they're extremely entitled to whatever they want because they got to the party first. 

Think about this: what if you bought a new car two months after your brother. The same exact car. What if your brother says that he wants a custom paint job for free just because he bought it first. That doesn't sound right. So when people when do the same with skins, it's annoying and stupid.

Let's just play the game, and not worry about things like the older map and the skins we bought. Epic already said that they're literally not able to bring back the old map, and they've showed before that they're not giving into those who think they're entitled, so just stop the posts, already. It's old. Oh sorry, I meant 'OG'.",FortNiteBR

Lastly, why the hell is one shot back out? This is the sixth time in the last month we have had one shot. We don’t want this shit, we want new LTMs and we want the ability to play solo LTM if we so choose. 

Also please bring back high explosives

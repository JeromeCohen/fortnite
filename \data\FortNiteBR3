Especially once they lowered the top 10 requirements to 50, it doesn’t seem to actually be that bad. 

I play a handful of Team Rumble games every Thursday when the new weekly challenges come out to complete them, and I also scoop up all the Fortbytes I hadn’t yet grabbed during the week. Outside of Team Rumble, I’ve only played 109 matches of the core modes so far which is about two to three games a day. And yet, I’m on pace to get over 300k XP and blow straight past the 225k required for the Fortbytes.

It’s definitely not turning out to be the grind I thought it would be.",FortNiteBR

Implement some kind of breathing system. If somebody stays in one place for say 5-10 seconds, there should be sound where people are breathing for staying idle too long. Not only will this decrease camping but it would force people to constantly move and actually play strategically. 

Remember how Epic said they were concerned with the overly aggressive play? Well, the game has done a 180 and now people are camping and hiding in corners more than ever. I don’t care what people say, it’s not a viable strategy and you’ll never improve by playing like that. 

It’s also really annoying to us players who actually try to improve only to get killed by a noob who’s hiding in a corner. It’s even worse when people on this sub justify bad play styles because it’s a part of the game. My solution? Make it so it’s not part of the game. 

I remember when everybody would blow gaskets over bush campers and now, if you’re not camping? You’re apparently trash. 

Seriously, punish campers and people who idle for too long. It’s literally not possible to counter somebody that you can’t hear.",FortNiteBR

For anyone else who isn’t always positive about the game, does it also feel like we’re battling to figure out which shotgun is the best to use every single game?  
Or ways to counter being hit in the head for the max damage of a tac, meanwhile hitting a 12 headset twice on someone’s head before they pull out a drum gun or burst smg on you. 

I just feel like whatever they’re doing to “improve the game” isn’t going to improve much of anything, unless they’re going for the most buggy game ever award, if there even is one.

Seems as though Season 1 to Season 6 (IMO) was the best time era for almost anyone who agrees. 7-9 is a consistent meta change, and it feels as though the game is becoming more annoying than fun to play. 

I really love this game, however it’s not keeping my hopes up, nor is it really making me happy anymore. It’s a battle between if I should even try competing in Arena, or playing casually to competitively in pub games.

I would guess most the players have lower frame rates &amp; ping.  Box style play is dominated by ping. Pro players move across the country to get a better ping.  That's how important it is.

Make edits take longer &amp; bring back the shoot &amp; build dynamic. Not best ping wins. Also will make competitive events more fun to watch.

It amazes/frustrates me how good everyone is in the game, and that casual players who can’t dedicate 6+ hours a day rarely get top 10 and winning is through luck (and that’s by hopefully not running into a TTV soccer skin). To me, Fortnite isn’t a game you can casually play and enjoy because I don’t think anyone likes getting killed then default danced on. But, I digress...

OG players will probably rage at me in the comments for making this suggestion but you know what, it’s a game and not everyone is as lucky as you.  
  If epic wanted to make not only a killing off of old BP skins, but avoid false advertising, they could release old bp skins into the store and call them throwbacks.  They could change some of the details, like change the colors or add different details to there outfits of hair.  That’s way if you still have the OG skins you still have the pristiness of the skin while still letting other players basically get the same thing. 

(ex- I joined at the end of season 2, but bought the bp for the first time in season 7. My favorite skin in the game is Dusk but alas she was just out of reach. Especially if next season they do a blast to the past theme, this would be a pretty good marketing tactic.)",FortNiteBR

Epic Games' removing weapons because of how good people are with them. The revolver, for example, was terrible unless you knew how to use it. Well once people learned good ways to use it well, the people who didn't know how to got angry, then made Epic vault it. It removes the high risk-high reward element completely. I liked Fortnite from Seasons 1-3, but after that Epic just kept messing stuff up and the community just got more and more demanding, which made Epic not know what to do. They still haven't fixed glitches about phasing through walls, and instead of using feedback from the community on certain weapons to fix them, they just vault them. Now, this would be fine for about a week or so, but not an entire season! 

&amp;#x200B;

Some other reasons include:

No need for as much tactics. Instead of keeping in cover when moving around, the thought is, ""Oh I can just build for cover"", removing a lot of tactics. Now, you do need some skills to build perfectly, but it isn't that hard to build a 'good enough' cover by spamming without any skill. Adding to this, you may snipe someone, then rush in to finish them off in their now built hut, only to find they already fully healed and that snipe was useless. I'm not saying building is a bad feature, but I am saying it's too easy to spam build instead of having actual skill.

Bad community. Let's be honest, the community is either full of small children or people just being toxic. Now, most popular multiplayer games have these, but none are as bad as Fortnite. Sure, kids doing Fortnite dances in real life sucks and I want it to stop and never come back, but it really only affects the person doing the dance(and the people around them during that short amount of time), especially if they are in an older grade at school, because they will be bullied(sadly). I'm not saying this is everyone, but there is a lot of them. The community also never knows what it wants, and if people are becoming really skilled with some weapons, the rest of the community will make sure that it is either nerfed or vaulted.

RNG mechanics. These are fine in games that are supposed to have luck involved, but not in a competitive shooter. Guns like the Minigun and LMG(which I think were both vaulted), are fine having this randomness, but when someone who is aiming perfectly misses with guns like an AR or SMG, something is definitely wrong. This may help some players with worse aim, but when someone with a lot of ammo can win against someone who has nearly perfect aim because they could shoot more, something is definitely wrong. A game has never been praised for the random bullet deviation. Games like Battlefield 1, which a lot of people liked, were heavily criticized for this. Also, the inconsistency in the shotguns is another huge problem, I sometimes do 30 damage to someone 30 feet away but 7 to someone 4 feet in front of me.

It's also a bit repetitive. Yeah, the map is always changing, but that doesn't make it not repetitive. Building skills usually differ from people that don't build, people who are bad at building, skilled builders, and spammers. Most of these people are spammers, just randomly building and hoping that it works(and it usually does). Them claiming it's just skill is like corner camping in Call of Duty and saying they're just good at the game. And it's really just a cycle of gameplay. Yes, most multiplayer shooters are like this, but if they are good they spice things up from time to time, or make some moments possible that don't seem easy to do at all. Fortnite has these moments too, but they are just amazing plays, not really any unique ones, just people being really good/lucky. Games like Battlefield have moments that could never happen anywhere else, called ""Only in Battlefield Moments"". And no, jumping off something and shooting someone is not something that happens in Fortnite only, it has existed since CoD MW1(and it was way too popular)

So hope that explains it, and Jesus Christ I just wrote a 5 paragraph essay on why I dislike Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

So a drift style coming out, that you have to pay for isn't much of a big deal to me.

What is, however, is the greed that will follow.

Yes, i know that skins are basically reskins; but not really. They use the same model but usually everything else is original, sometimes they wear masks, have vibrant colors, logos. Every skin is basically different.

Epic adding a shirt and short pants to a battle pass and selling it for 15$ is just greed.

It's a loophole they found.

""The exclusive cosmetics items you earn from a battle pass are yours to keep forever and will not be obtainable again.""

These are their own words.

If they're going to do this we can expect more reskinned battle pass skins that can be bought for people that didn't buy them.

Want Omega with lights? Don't worry. In a year Epic will release a style with animated colors. Not for Omega owners, but in the shop.

Want Black Knight? Don't worry. They'll add sandals and release it in the shop.

The rumors of Fortnite dying must be true if they're that desperate to get the money of people who missed a battle pass skin",FortNiteBR

He made a comment that made me think. The comment was ""This is why I don't play Fortnite anymore, everybody is really good these days"". I looked back to what he said and I wanted to talk about why people are leaving Fortnite, the skill gap.

&amp;#x200B;

When I mean the skill gap I mean the gap in between bad players to pro players is huge. Especially in pubs when I'm an ok average player and I get put with TTV's and players who probably play claw (I play on Console). And a reason I think bad players aren't becoming good is that Epic hasn't added a tutorial for new players. Epic needs to show new players how to play Fortnite, what is the meta in Fortnite that is the most effective, and to show them basic tips like building, editing, and of course, aim. This will get new players to get the basics down so that they can have a chance to become better than the chances I had without any sort of help.

&amp;#x200B;

Another idea is a ""Practice Mode"". This mode will have a lobby of 100 players. 99 of them are bots who are in either level . that is going to be listed below:

Easy-An Actual bot.

Medium-A bot that has the skill of an average player.

Hard-A bot that is has the skill of an above average player.

Expert-A bot that has the skill of a pro.

&amp;#x200B;

I think this would help because you can get a constant amount of practice with a different level of difficulty without having to play with a friend or trying to find someone to practice with. And I would replace Team Rumble with this because Team Rumble doesn't represent a good depiction of real Fortnite gameplay for people who use Team Rumble for practice. When I play team Rumble I am constantly hit with constant action, not saying that regular Fortnite doesn't have constant action, its that some players prefer to camp. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this long article. Please leave feed some feedback to make this idea as perfect as possible and I want to try and get Epic to notice this so that they can do something about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you,  CoppellE-Boy",FortNiteBR

Bad guns like the tac shotguns and Burst smg litter the game because no one complains about them since they are worthless. What I’ve noticed is that the player base won’t be happy until the game gets to the point where the only guns in the game are SCARs and shotguns instead of accepting new play styles and adapting to new guns like the Book Bow, Guided missile, drum gun (before it was nerfed).  And apparently no one realizes the reason the game is so sweaty is because there’s too much mobility. In my opinion the only mobility should be quads, hoverboards, ballers, launch pads, and gliders.

Shotguns have no bloom which made players automatically prefer fighting up close because it was more reliable and Epic's solution to this makes no sense. The blue pump only did about 90 damage to the body and it had a very slow fire rate, the combat does around 70 damage to the body and can be shot again less than a second later, I can guarantee that shotguns still make up around 26% of eliminations in the game, maybe even more, because the combat is even easier to use than the pump. The combat shotgun is essentially a slightly nerfed double pump. Epic's other solution was nerfing the spawn rate of the combat shotgun into the ground, all this did was make it so that the people who were lucky enough to find a combat pretty much won every encounter they had, even at medium range.

The pump needs to come back in season 10, the 2 shotguns can coexist in the game with both having their own specialty. The way fortnite is played forces close quarters fighting and the most effective way to fight close up is with a shotgun, Epic had no reason to be unhappy with how often shotguns were used, if you didn't use one you automatically put yourself at a huge disadvantage, this fact hasn't changed with or without the pump.",FortNiteBR

That would explain why it only leaves one or two footprints everywhere it goes. If it’s walking everywhere, we’d see more prints, but when it recently showed up at the loot lake factories, there was only one, and no trace of where it went. It’s possible the creature appeared in the fortnite world from the upside down, destroyed a little bit, and went back into hiding. Just a theory, sorry if it was hard to track.

shot and another time you TRIPLE headshot some player. Also removing the tactical shotgun would be a good decision. It has very low DPS/damage per second. It shoots so slow compared to the combat, only 8 bullets and so

All fights have become you spraying 5 shots maybe hitting 1 that does 30 damage and then both players building up to the sky in a peak/exit shotgun fight until one of them dies or just glides away like nothing ever happened.  How boring.

I always get overbuilded and I can get annoyed pretty quicly, damn, the game is even called FORTNite and not RAMPNite, RUSHNite, TURBOBUILDNite. So, I think, FortNite should return to its roots, to Season 1, when the game was about building little forts and surviving. But that's my opinion. What do you guys think? The game would be better in your opinions? Feel free to what you think, I'm open to all sort of opinions. Bye!",FortNiteBR

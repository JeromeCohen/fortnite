All health on kills does is further the skill gap, making it harder for noobs and average players to survive to end game. If there was a ranked mode, this would be fine, but there's not.

Now I've gotten a squad and duo win this season, but my god were they harder than ever. Almost every fight I'd get into whether it was first circle or last circle felt like a scrim build battle that went on forever. 

Now I think the mat cap is fine, quicker harvesting is definitely great, but health on kills should remain in pop-ups. Without ranked It's not a suitable mechanic for pubs. It'd be better to just increase spawn rate of healing items.

Season 2: Bad players love the game, average players love the game, good players love the game.

Season 8: Bad players quit the game, average players are shaky on the game, good players mostly like the game.

The difference between Season 2 and Season 8 is that Season 2 had a respectable skill gap whereas the skill gap in Season 8 is off the charts.  Let me explain...

Bad players need to have fun when jumping into a match.  They need to feel there's a reasonable chance that they'll see or do something successful.  Right now, many bad players no longer feel that they have a good enough chance for that to happen, so they leave.  How do we know they'll leave?  Because it's natural.  Take a look at this...

https://youtu.be/cS9wzAjbJ24

This is a video of an old fishing tradition still done in select parts of China using birds to collect fish.  The interesting component here is that these birds will stop ""working"" for these fishermen if they're not given a certain percentage of fish.  In other words if a bird gets to eat 1 out of every 5 fish he/she catches, he'll keep performing for the fishermen.  If the bird only gets to eat 1 out of 20 fish he catches, the bird stops looking for fish.

Once the bots stop getting a certain percentage of kills in Fortnite, they'll stop playing.  Then the mid tier player becomes the bots.  Once the mid tier player stops getting a certain percentage of kills, what do you think they do?  They quit.  Then a certain percentage of good players become the bots...

Fortnite is losing players, as evidence by Epics Oceania servers removing duos from their playlist.  Epic only has two options to stop the exodus.

1. Shrink the skill gap by nerfing building.

2. Add a ranked mode that will take care of less skilled players.",FortNiteBR

1. Allow double pump only on green pumps

Self explanatory they suck so double pump can happen with those

2. Nerf damage when double pumping

How about instead of getting 110 + 110 with a gold pump, we get 80 + 80 or 70 + 60 etc.

3. (PROPER) Skilled matchmaking 

Simply just put pros and noobs in the same servers so noobs that can double pump can use SMG on each other’s and we pros can double pump the FRICK OUT OF EACH OTHER

I will post any other options if people comment anything

Both are incredible games with insanely high skill gaps.

One has lasted 1,500 years with no signs of slowing down.

The other burst onto the scene in late 2017 and is already showing signs of shakiness.

Fortnite became the phenom that it is for one main reason.  When people saw the game they instantly saw a variety of interesting choices, a playground of sorts.

""Oh you can hide in bushes?""
""Oh you can snipe on that hill?""
""Oh you can use loot to bait enemies?""
""Oh you can jump in that vehicle over there?""

Fortnite is instantly recognizable as a game that gives players a magnitude of interesting decisions to make during a match.

What's causing so many problems now is that mechanical skill is destroying the fun experimental playground aspect of the game.  Every interesting decision is getting run over by players with superior mechanical skill.  

The game quite literally has significantly fewer tactical options today than it did back in Seasons 1-4.

Compare that to Chess.  A game that can be played by the fastest 22 year old minds, the youngest kids, or the oldest people.  Chess is a game that gives players a variety of tactical options that do not require a high level of mechanical skill.  Choices are more important.

TLDR: The more Epic caters to the no life sweats, the quicker this game will die.",FortNiteBR

Bring back 7.4 weapon spawn/rarity.,"I hate to make a post out of pure frustration, but this is just ridiculous. I have been playing since Season 1 and never have I experienced such a lack of weapon spawns until now.   


If I try to loot ground loot, Goodluck! Have fun winning with 40 bandages and 3000 ammo for guns that you'll never find! Open a chest? Have an infantry rifle and fireworks! Finally found a gun? Oops! As of 8.0.0 all the rarities seem to consistent of only grey and green guns spawning!... oh and I forgot to mention only infantry and pistols spawn 90% of the time. But it's a part of the game! Get used to RNG!

&amp;#x200B;

Again, I really despise having to make a post about this, but what the hell did Epic do to the loot table? In a season with a theme of treasure and adventure, why bother going for treasure or loot when 99% of it is trash? Reverting the loot table back to 7.4's and lowering the spawn rate of things like infantry rifles and fireworks can really help make this season not a pain in the ass off the start. There is no reason that I should drop Lazy Lagoon and find no shield, guns (besides infantry lolz), and fifty bandages, as well as only ammo as floor loot; even with RNG, that is absolute bullshit. Matches are no longer, ""land and find a weapon to defend against others"", it's now, ""land and hope to god you ATLEAST get an infantry rifle or even when chest spawn, even in a tilted building"".

I looked at both sides and understand both sides. There’s those who say Ranked will just be more frustrating because they can’t find any casual players after getting deep enough. 

So, my idea is to make it reward driven. I play STW and there we have 3 currencies, V-Bucks, Gold, and Coins. The coins are the ones I considered here. Maybe in ranked they can give one coin per win. With these coins you can spend in a seasonal shop. 5 coins for a spray, 9 for an emote, 12 for a glider and so on. The better the reward the more expensive it becomes. You don’t have to buy them in order so if you don’t want the spray and would rather save for a better item you can do that. This way we keep players in ranked as they know they can get rewards that won’t be coming back, season exclusive. 

Then, keep Solos as it is. Make Ranked its own playlist, think of it as a 24/7 pop-up cup that keeps your rank throughout the season. You then have a reason to play Ranked and the availability of playing against the more casual players when you don’t want to sweat.  ",FortNiteBR

* Let's say a ranked mode is implemented, what will stop Tfue junior for joining the non-ranked games so he could flex on his twitch fans as a fake default ?  Literally nothing, there would be better players coming into non-ranked lobbies just to validate their skill. If you are skillful, here, play with 100 players as skilled as you, let's see if you are good enough in that situation..isn't that **fair** ?
* My solution to this is: **separate players based on their K/D ratio**, most sweats have 15+ kills, it would be easy to group players based on that..I'm so tired Epic, I don't enjoy Fortnite anymore like I used to, everytime I play I end up being a bit angry because I just play to chill and not to have the biggest kill score in the game or to stream it to my fans. And I also want to win, of course, but I'm not going to practice all day everyday during 5 hours just to get some victories..I have more things to do in my life, most kids don't, they just come from school, end their homework and play all day.  
* When I started playing in Season 3 there would still be like 50 players in the match after 3 storm circles closed, now most games have 30 players and not even the first storm has closed..what's this ? I get the feeling that some people are playing like their life is in the game.  
* If I land in some place and I don't have any weapon people would not give a shit about it even if I emote them 3 hearts, 5 salutes and 100 crouches. **This would also could get solved by having players have a temporary invincible shield (let's say 30 seconds of duration, for example) once they first land ONLY if they don't have weapons, once you get a weapon, trap, or grenade, your shield is deactivated.** Because I find it very unfair to land in a place where you only find ammo and then you cross with someone that had all the weapons from that place because he ironically managed to land before you there..  

I don't want to stop playing this game, because I love the art and gameplay but I rarely enjoy it anymore...

To save you all the headache, I'll just straight up say it -- The game is way too fast paced!

I used to, and still do on occasion play this game with friends, however unless every single one of them is lazer focused we cannot get a win, and while I do understand entirely that it's a competitive game, it seems that with each update the skill gap widens even more than it was previously. I am a casual player, most of my friends are casual players -- we play the game for the fun, because that's what it has been to us for a long while. 

The first major skill gap was the building nerf and while it was more difficult to kill players, it was easier for casual players to survive longer and allow them more time to think in combat. Back then one rocket would only destroy one platform or wall and damage others around it. Now one rocket destroys literally everything you have. There was a time when an AR couldn't just spray through all your builds, because it would take up too much ammo. 

I do not think Epic Games should focus on the competitive players only, rather let the skilled players find competitive aspects of a fun game, so that everyone may enjoy it. Please do not misunderstand, I know a lot of those super skilled players have fun getting 20+ kill games, but do keep in mind that this is an absurd number -- you're killing off 20% of a 100 player lobby, where every fight there is an equal opportunity to kill the opposing player. The issue is simply that most people cannot react, and I don't think that this is how Fortnite was supposed to be.

&amp;#x200B;

You can no longer build your own structures. My friends and I used to build forts all the time and shoot from the top of it at other players in their forts, and this had it's own unique fun. Friends playing, laughing -- having a good time. Now? You have to be super focused, and there is no laughter in this.

&amp;#x200B;

Low latency players have an extreme advantage in this fast paced meta. While I'm holding down my build button at 40 latency, another player at 20 latency is getting shots through. The solution? Don't force us to hold down builds, rather let one build suffice so that players can have time to breathe and enjoy the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Quad Crashers, Hover boards, Rift to Go -- everything that gives a player extreme mobility is hurting the game in a big way, at least in terms of fun for players. While these things are super cool and fun to use, over time they become unfun to experience or see at any point in the game. It is too easy for anyone anywhere on the map to go anywhere, and so for some people the fight is endless, and they never get a break -- and for others the game is too empty and open, and the only fight they find is the one that ends the game for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just overall, the fast paced combat removes the opportunity for players and their friends to just have a good time. Everything just moves way .. too .. fast..

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys are gonna do this, atleast give us players who got the Bundle Set with a code an Exclusive Style. 

&amp;#x200B;

People are saying it wasn't exclusive but here's evidence:

Since the evidence I shown proves the set was \*EXCLUSIVE\* it should have NEVER of been released in the shop!

&amp;#x200B;

So Epic I ask you now, how you gonna compensate us players who actually got the Bundle Set with a code?

&amp;#x200B;

My suggestion is release this Black Style for the whole set and give it to anyone who redeemed a code to get the set, here's some concept art: [https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0vHEB3X0AIq1\_m.jpg](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D0vHEB3X0AIq1_m.jpg)

Please actually make it a thing, because this is unacceptable. If you re-release an \*Exclusive\* Bundle Set, then who's to say you won't re-release Black Knight and any Battlepass Item?

Seriously Epic, don't ever do this again and give us players who actually got the Bundle Set with a code, a Special Style!

People improve over time and people want to win. I *totally* get that. I’m one of those people who comment that sort of stuff on other posts (and, ironically, I’d post it *here* too) but I concede that this game is at a peak of competitive play at the moment to the point that any sort of fun is negated by the intensity of pubs.

If you’re a new player reading this, or someone that only plays a few times a week, I genuinely salute you. This game is really, really tough at the moment. Keep practicing the best you can via Creative/Team Rumble and whatever else you can do to improve. 

Something has to happen in my opinion. This can only drive away more players than it will attract. I’m seeing more and more of these posts and comments regarding the competitive level that Fortnite is at right now. I’d argue that Fortnite is getting a reputation for being a sweatfest. 

If I made Fortnite, I wouldn’t want it to be seen that way. A sweatfest designed for the elite. No thanks. I’d want to be able to include everyone, not a minority of players.

I saw a couple of posts from fellow subredditors were offering to help carry for a dub, and I wanted to ask the sub if anyone would be so kind as to help me out! I'm a very average player I think (although the average has risen quite a bit and left me behind!). I can shoot and kind of build on Xbox, but I'm no good.

I'm loving the umbrella this season and want to get just one dub, but I really don't think I can do it on my own. I've gotten one solo dub by being lucky, and been carried a few times by some friends at school, but it's been pretty rough grinding it ever since everyone got gud. I can make it to top 10 by being sneaky, but I can never outbuild those last few! If you're up to it, please add me! I could use a little help and some friends to play with, too!

I mostly play Friday/Saturday nights because I'm busy with school.

Being a player that plays competitively, the game just has been feeling very bad this season, when guns fully bloom out, and I lose to what seems like complete rng.

The main problem I see is the one that I see repeated over and over again, ""the loot pool is too over saturated."" I feel this the worst when I get a grey pistol, and an opponent that chooses to 50/50 me gets a shotgun. I get the first shot often, but bloom and low damage makes it very easy for them to just one pump me.

My suggestion is this: and aim punch to Fortnite.

I think this could work well with the shooting model, by rewarding players for using FSA and/or taking the time to aim, as well as players who get the first punch. From this, in my situation above, I wouldn't have to feel hopeless, or feel like I am just shooting him to hurt him and make him lose to the next player. If I am faster than him, and hit him first, it would throw of his aim and make him less likely to hit me back. This would also help building, as the way to stop an attacker and reset your aim would be to build and then start again. The player who hits the first shot would then gain the advantage at the next go.

Maybe this wouldn't work, and if you disagree with this, discuss about it below.

TL:DR - I think Aim Punch should be added to Fortnite",FortNiteBR

Another squad member runs up and gets one pumped, so of course the enemy eliminated him immediately. Now the enemy who should be knocked by now is back to 130+ health.

Here's my story.,"First lemme give you context. I'm not great at this game. I can build kinda well, I can stair rush. And sometimes I can get the highground. But I guarantee you that I SUCK compared to other players. So, this was kinda my great victory. Come play with me if ya want. My username is BobunkleKrunkle. Find me.

So I woke up this morning, got up, and started my computer. I was in the mood for some FortNite, so I loaded it up. I felt pretty good about myself that day. My first game involved me going to the Lazy Lagoon (Can I just call it Port Royale?) and to the hinted location in the Week 1 poster thingy. I got my snake glider and was pretty happy. I even got in the top 20 in that game (surprisingly.) But I craved for *more*. I wanted to win. I hadn't gotten a single win in either season 6 or 7. So as you could tell, I was pretty deprived for one.

 I had been playing since season three, yet I seem not to have built up much skill. I am quite limited by my sub-par PC. I knew that I had to rely on someone else to get the win. That's where my buddy (lets call him A) takes a turn into this story.  A is really good at the game, he plays on console as well. And since we didn't really have any other buddies, he was all I got. We played some duos, and even got 3rd one match! With each match played, I slowly realized that I simply wasn't good enough to win, even with my good buddy. 

With each and every sweat to encounter us, I got angrier and angrier, until I lost hope. We were both done with bad results, and split off. Deprived of hope, I decide to go one more solo game. But not just ANY solo game. I wanted to play with the sweats and pros, I wanted a *real* challenge. I thought very little of this game, thinking it a mere joke. But I was wrong. Oh so wrong. I started going to my favorite place to hang out, Paradise Palms. I'm quite familiar with this location. After all, I *did* watch LukeTheNotable's vid on the location. Not a single soul was there, however I was too scared to explore the Hotel.

Wouldn't have mattered much, I was still doing good for myself. I had a sniper and scar (Both very important to my loadout.) And I headed off to Lucky Landing. I had a little skirmish on the way, but I lost him and would soon re-encounter him later. No matter, I had more important things to do. The eye of the storm moved fast, so I had to reposition myself with a bottled rift and several jump pads. Whilst I did this, players poked each other in their wooden towers. 

I lowered myself onto a building to snipe others from a distance. Two others were exchanging shotgun blasts and SMG spreads. I almost hit them, but in the end, I really shouldn't have. I needed to save them for later. I needed them to be in a big three person group ripe for the picking. And so they did join each other. Four left. Me, and them. Two were drinking away at big shield potions and one was preserving his high ground. I decided to pick at the low hanging fruit. Both ended up dead with a sniper round. 

All I needed was this last guy dead. He decided to preserve his highground for he had a rocket saved personally for me. But I shot his high ground down, and he was on my level. You've lost this Obi Wan. He fired off his rocket, a simple mistake to waste away at his life. And a well placed shotgun blast did me good. So *this* is how liberty dies? And lemme tell you, when I was in the top 10, I was so nervous I was shaking mad crazy. But that wouldn't let me lose. As soon as I won, I ran around my house, pestered my brother, and told my mom of how crazy this was. My adrenaline was off the charts. My first win against the sweats.

***OKAY YEAH SORRY FOR RAMBLING AND SHIT. I COULD HAVE MADE THIS SHORTER. BUT THIS SHOWS THAT EVEN NOOBS CAN WIN A GAME WITH SKILL. SWEATS AREN'T INVINCIBLE AND PROS CAN GO SUCK A FAT ONE. THE ODDS WERE THE EXACT SAME BACK THEN AS THEY ARE NOW. I FEEL LIKE A GOD. 1 IN A 100 BABY!***",FortNiteBR

Many people bought these specifically because the skins were rare. And since it costed so much it shouldnt just be released fo please people who think that it's a good idea.

Give the people who already had the bundle exclusive styles. Keep other stuff like the galexy skin and eon skin free.

I want the eon skin but it shouldnt be released in the shop like that, it's called exclusive. same with galexy. They need to give people who payed extra for the skin more styles so people who like it for the fact it was uncommon are happy, as well as people who just like the way it looks.",FortNiteBR

Its wrong.

Skull trooper got its own style for OGs (like what?) for a skin that was originally released in the item shop. Now I dont give two shits about OG or rare skins but what epic did HERE in this very situation is scummy. 

There have been screenshots saying it was exclusive and screenshots saying it was only for a limited time.

Im over it, let the majority have it. Next time,  make it clear that the skins included in your bundles are not exclusive.  Because while every console has its own exclusive you would think that the counterattack set was the PC exclusive.

If cheaters make money using cheats people who report them successfully should also get something in return.

I think by implementing this players who know somome that's cheating in a game will give the player some incentive 

Nowadays most people will assume that the report system doesn't work or there is so many reports happening that epic will ignore it. 

TL;DR A successful report should come with a reward. ",FortNiteBR

It has come to my attention that the Counterattack bundle has come to the shop. This bundle was supposed to be an exclusive bundle in which you would receive after buying an nvidia graphics card. For some reason, epic decided to bring this skin to the item shop even though it was supposed to by an **exclusive** skin. Furthermore, original owners of the counterattack bundle are not even being rewarded a unique style for spending their money on the skin. 

This in my opinion is a new low for Fortnite - to advertise a $400 skin as exclusive and to then put that ""exclusive"" skin in the shop a month later. 

Epic, stop being money-hungry and add a style for this skin for people who bought the bundle.",FortNiteBR

Did we vault the fun?,"Fortnite is in a really strange place and it's become very obvious. Sweats and bots and blah blah blah. The game changed seemingly overnight. I've made posts giving my opinion as a ""casual"" player since season 1. But what does EPIC think?

It's my opinion that EPIC made a lot of changes to COMBAT the growing skill base of Fortnite. Things like planes, balloons, boomboxes, dynamite...ect all seem incredibly obvious in their intent. To counter build based playstyles. Anyone can shoot a missle or fly a plane through a build. Which means anyone can get a kill. Even on someone who plays every day. The sword encroached on building way too hard and was rightfully vaulted. 

And then it kept happening. Every single aspect to counter or punish building was vehemently posted about. People hated them. The Boombox is the ultimate example. It was hailed as the end of an era to some and people hardly used them. Like at all. And then different changes like health/shield siphon were added. Giving a massive boost to aggressive playstyles and veteran players. And the rocket nerf. 

So it's clear, in my opinion, that EPIC has tried to counter the massive skill gap with unique items, weapons, and vehicles . Things that really set Fortnite apart. Something I consider a large part of Fortnite's identity. Something that REALLY shone at the beginning of season 7! FUN! The game used to be whacky and light hearted. And I think we vaulted the things that made Fortnite so much fun. 

But what does EPIC think? What do y'all think? Because I don't think ranks or sbmm are going to help this situation. But I'm losing hope tbh, its just not fun anymore...",FortNiteBR

First of all, the RPG. No RPG belongs in a battle royale. Yeah, Apex may have explosives but they dont have an RPG that can one shot you and has no damage fall off. RPGs have no place in any battle royale, as i assume skill is meant to win a game, they require no skill at all. Secondly, the boogie bomb. Its like playing a pacify card in Magic The Gathering. It can make skill, again useless. So do traps. Traps, if placed earlier in the game, are undetectable (take you crouch-walking through every door.) and require no skill to get kills with. I see that Epic is trying to make it easier for worse players to get kills, but its annoying. I really hope these things get vaulted. ",FortNiteBR

I was traveling out of the country for the last 2 weeks. Excited to play season 8, cuz I had missed the opportunity to complete all the challenges to get the battle pass for free. No big deal. 

Here I go this morning booting up the PS4 excited to play and low and behold Epic decides to fuck around with the sensitivity again. God dammit. I’ve tried every number. From 10-1 and it’s such bullshit. I want my sensitivity back!! Anyone else dealing with this shit?? Season 7 I had it at around 8. And it was butter. Now I can’t even run up 2 flights of stairs smoothly like before. 

Also the god damn camera just pulls up when I’m just sitting in the crouched position. My hands don’t even have to be on the controller!! WTF EPIC??? Please tell me I’m not the only one?!?!? 

I know people joke around about this game being “Literally Unplayable” and I used to laugh at those posts. But for real this game is LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE now. So disappointed. 😔

I want my money back. ",FortNiteBR

Did I complain? No. I knew that they have been practicing.  I learned the game simply by playing.

Nowadays you got playground and creative and these kids still cry? Just fkn stop. It’s a PVP game not some minecraft casual shit expect players to be better than you. I don’t understand people when they say some people build burj khalifa in 2 seconds is it because you are not building at all or what?

Just fkn get better and don’t cry.  Don’t expect to just randomly jump into a game and win that will never happen if you are not practicing

I really feel like lazar beams most recent vid ( I think) where they were all bananas and doing the conga line and suddenly a try hard squad comes along and just destroys them really proves my point- nobody cares about having fun and the relationship between player and player everyone only cares about get high kill games and looking as good as they can to everyone around them.

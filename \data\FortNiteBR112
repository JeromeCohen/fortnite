I think it should definitely be and option. For you who don't know skilled matchmaking is where the game puts you against people who are on your skill level.

Secondly, it's not fun for me and probably other Switch players what we get killed by PS4 and Xbox players right away in a game or just sniped from 200 meters away because it's nearly impossible to see 200 meters away on the Switch.

Thirdly, it was fine before you paired us with only Switch players in Solos, but you now have a pair us with PS4 and Xbox for some damn reason. It was better for us to play with the other consoles in Duos and Squads.

In the end, I would like a fair and PLAYABLE game where the Switch players get lobbies with Switch and NOT with PS4 and Xbox. I would also like to note that the game isn't fun any more  with the other consoles in play, it makes the game harder to play and frustratingly unplayable. I want the Switch players to keep playing and I hope you Epic do too. 

Thank you for reading.",FortNiteBR

60% bots

20% good bots 

15% really good players 

4% competitive pub stompers. 

1% the guy that was gonna win the match in the first place. 

Instead of bitching about it needlessly, I figured I might as well pull out some stats. 

Here we have [Ninja](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Ninja). This is a guy who has put hundreds of hours into the game, competes at a competitive level, and is considered by many the best player in the game. 

Here we have [Me](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/xd%20Golden%20Boy). Your standard casual who plays pretty good but isn't that good. 

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, these two have no connection, but I'll start drawing some lines. 

Here are the stats for a [guy I ran into](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Kaboinglefop) in an lfg discord. He is the guy that can pretty much dominate anybody he runs into, plays solo-squads for fun, and might compete in scrims. He has around 1400 wins, putting him at around 2,600th. 

Here are the stats for [another guy I ran into](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/sutivens) in the same discord. he has quite a few wins less, 932, putting him at almost 11,000th. He is a very good player, wins 80% of his encounters and probably plays solo-squads to get better. 

Almost last, the stats for [a friend of mine](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Leon%20Dab). He can solo-squad on occasion, and probably wins about 60% of his encounters. he has 652 wins, putting him at 30,500th. 

Now last, the stats for [another friend of mine](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/xd%203Verse.tv). He really can't solo-squad, mostly a pub stomper, your standard twitch streamer. He has 250 wins, putting him at 255,000th. 

Okay, these number all mean something. Pretty much every guy I listed has a fat chance at winning any lobby they step into. That means for pretty much any casual, there are 255,000 lobbies where they have next to no shot at winning. Once we arrive at little old me, I have 7 wins. I have no chance against any of these players. Therefore, the odds of me getting better and wanting to play this game get slimmer every day. 

EPIC, I know the key to success is catering to your casual community, but truthfully, the competitive players know what'll be best for the game in the long run. Lowering the skill gap is not the key, because basically the odds of me getting a quad launcher and Ninja getting a quad launcher are the same, and regardless Ninja is winning that matchup. A ranked playlist or a ranking system would be such a far step forward, it makes the game more enjoyable for literally everyone. It encourages players to want to rank up, while the worse players don't have to worry about being superstars to win matches. Even though the worse players don't have to try as hard, if they rank up they'll have to get better. Honestly, I'm not sure what the casual community thinks of this but I really don't know what else to say. After grinding since, ahem, MAY OF LAST YEAR, I am still unable to increase my skill significantly. Please, I don't know what to say, but jeez this game sucks if you aren't good. It's so deflating and demoralizing to lose every game and then have to queue up just to lose again. obviously, I am not going to stop playing, then I won't be able to keep up and get better, but I can't stand being bad at this game. I haven't played an actual game of fortnite in like 2 months. I have been sitting in creative practicing 90s and edit courses just for the hope of coming out able to compete in another two months. That's all. 

TL;DR: EPIC please add some sort of ranked system because the odds of casual players winning any lobbies are next to none at this stage in the game.",FortNiteBR

The ‘competitive community’ that is mostly full of people below the age of 16 (I’m talking about the people that actually compete in skirmishes, I’m referring to those that have never made a penny from this game and claim to be pro. You know the type?). 

This community is full of people who bash streamers for not being able to compete or do 90s perfectly. A few examples:

Ninja the other day stopped playing a few hours into his stream as he had his own subs calling him bad.

HighDistortion constantly gets called a bot farmer and people refuse to accept his skill even though he is about to hit 100,000 kills in the game.

Majority of streamers have started to look for other games to keep there stream entertaining. This is a BIG problem, streamers at the end of the day are what keep games alive (to an extent). Remember how fun the game was when people weren’t trying to win a scrim lobby and instead just tried to have fun, get some cool kills and use the new items to do wacky stuff.

Fortnite needs a separate ranked mode now more than ever. New players won’t wanna play this game if they have no chance of winning, good players will get fed up of having to try and get into a good lobby.

This is a big rant but I just want my game to be fun again, I want to watch streamers having fun again.

I have died 100 times too many due to vehicle that i can't believe are still in the game and even though it has been nerfed, it still doesn't really feel like they are any harder to mindlessly kill people with. 

I like fortnite and i play it because i am rather good at it but also because it takes some amount of skill to be good at, well til season 7 came along. Now when I am having a good build battle with another well skilled player I am now always in fear of a plane coming to bash me all the way to my death with the pilot at basically zero risk at getting killed at all.

Fixes for this broken vehicle have not been in the right direction for me, i feel that if you get a plane and fly about for half the game with around no risk of dying then this is not a good component of the game and should really be removed. But if the vault is not an option then at least take away the knockback on a player as getting knocked back by a plane is much harder to recover from than it just obliterating your builds. Also lessen the damage it does when you get hit by at as it already has guns to do said damage. this means it will be used more like a plane and not just a kamikaze machine.

Again, this has probably all been said before but i had to get it out of my head.

TL,DR - vault or nerf planes",FortNiteBR

Over and over. I'll take anything over these, it has no teamwork at all. It's driving me nuts. I force myself to play Squads for this reason. 

Disco, no one goes for objectives just straight go for kills, I do the same. Because who the heck wants to dance? Food Fight people just kill each other anyways and the Mascots slowly depletes anyway. Team Rumble you can drop like over 20 kills and still lose. Glide down behind someone, kill them without them noticing. Uneven teams with 7 people down, how is it fun? The damn circle for TR is also too damn big. 

Game modes like 50v50 has people working together. I don't care if it's one-sided. Close 50s matches are the most fun, I know I can survive for that long to be able to reach there, because of the amount of games I've put into Squads. Just seeing my 50s clips makes me so sad, how much I miss it. How fun it is and relaxing. Seeing the no skins reviving you, emoting with others, throwing hearts at one another when you get revived. I also, revive anyone that's downed when possible.

I don't know how much longer are people going to wait who really enjoys 50s. I'm Level 100 this season also, I can chill out without playing the normal modes and just do challenges. Really hope it makes it return soon. 

I just can't stand respawn modes. Know how to survive, carry your own weight and you won't be needing it.

You can hit someone for over 200 damage and then switch to a compact for example that tags for 21 for body and 42 in the head. Being able to switch to backup weapons destroys the risk while keeping the reward. I see the pump as a high risk/high reward weapon. If you miss a shot, you wont be shooting again for a while. But if you hit a nice shot you will send someone back to the lobby immediately. But being able to just switch to a SMG if you miss a shot makes no sense. You miss a shot, you miss a shot. You made a mistake.

I always have shield and as a result I’m always having fun. I think it’s a great balance because they give shield and allow shield items to be more abundant but they also do have their downsides to counter for all the good things they bring to the game such as breaking buildings down and sometimes preventing healing but even the breaking of buildings is a good thing. It teaches people that love to overbuild that highground really doesn’t mean much if you aren’t gonna play aggressive and drop down once you have it. You can turbo build to highground but you’ll most likely get knocked down because of the zombies and therefore zombies encourage more aggressive gameplay and forces build fights closer to the ground which is great for the good player that doesn’t want to obnoxiously build because he knows he can play the low ground and easily kill the ttv sweat that’s overbuilding (it’s always what I do so I would know). Forces people to outgun and outedit the other player with smart efficient techniques like the Tfue classic (shotgunning then placing a floor above your opponent). It allows for more circulation of shield which leads to more fair gameplay and conserves mats as it discourages overbuilding and honestly many of us including me, wouldn’t have a problem if you kept zombies in the game. Think of it like this, “save the world” has zombies so just implement that into battle royale as well and make it more of a core mechanic or a trademark like it is a core mechanic in “save the world”. AND my last and most IMPORTANT point is it is the perfect counter to building. No more do we require dynamite and turrets and smgs and miniguns and quad launchers, the game will no longer require new additions to counter building when zombies are the most natural and efficient counter to the morons that love to overbuild. It’s a great addition in many aspects and it should be kept.",FortNiteBR

Very cool. 

Now what? 

Soon Epic Games will release a new, very well hidden skin, called The Capitalist. He is the true EVIL villain. With his introduction will come a new named location that will replace Lazy Links. It will have the usual quirky name you have come to expect from Epic Games. Because I am not quirky nor am I creative, i will call this place... Entitlement Enterprises for now. 

Essentially, Mr Capitalist conjures up this EVIL and CORRUPT plan. He decides to steal 78% of all shields in the island, so that he may begin manufacturing them in Entitlement Enterprises. The demand for more shields increases as all the Sweaty Steves and even the Casual Callums suffer from the lack of protection and are vulnerable to attack from Third Partying Parasites. 

Mr Capitalist, being the man that he is, notices this demand and forces all players to pay a small amount of V-bucks so that they can have their delicious shields. The way this will be incorporated is by adding the phone into a different slot where the player may call Mr Capitalist and request an air drop of shields. 

The prices will be:

5 Vbucks for 3 Minis
3 Vbucks for 1 Half Pot
2 Vbucks for 1 Slurp
15 Vbucks for a rugtug chug jug

Players will be angered but over time they will learn to accept that their opinions mean nothing and will gladly pay for shields. However as more and more players buy shields, Entitlement Enterprises begins to struggle with the demand, and so Mr Capitalist sets up various outpost around the map to increase productivity. But with this mass increase in industrialisation comes more and more pollution or maybe the sun just gets hotter I don’t know. 

The island begins to heat up.

The snow begins to melt. Polar Peak is threatened. If all of Polar Peaks melts, there will be a great flood unlike anything you could imagine. Various places around the map will suffer from the increase of water levels. Tilted Towers will be heavily affected. Fortnite will be praised by everyone as it is clear they are emphasising what global warming could do. No Fortnite player watches documentaries as their addiction is too overpowering, but this event will cause them to binge watch amateur YouTube documentaries about Global Warming, they will change their Facebook profile picture to include a frame with something like “Stop Global Warming”.. This event will bring everyone together for a long time, or maybe a few weeks before everyone hates each other again or Epic Games adds another stupid thing to the game. 
 
Then, a new set of skins will be revealed.  Basically they will look like a bunch of hipsters and anarchists and will fight again the evil Mr Capitalist. There will be a skin called Mrs Revolution who will lead this.... revolution... and will make shields free for everyone again. Yay Socialism folks! Her character will inspire women and encourage them to rebel against evil, white, capitalistic, patriarchal, abusive men. Which is essentially all men as long as you are white. Even if you’re gay but still white you will not be safe. 

They will succeed in their mission and yay woohoo whatever celebrations forever. 

Thus concludes Season 7. I am contacting my sources to gather more info on Season 8. Stay tuned. ",FortNiteBR

2. Drop as a team. Getting singled out (1v4) or putting your teammates down a guy (3v4) is a huge disadvantage.
3. Share loot, mats and ammo. Just because you don't need something doesn't mean your teammates doesn't. Hogging all the loot can render a teammate useless if they have nothing to build or shoot with.
4. Look at your teammates health and shield. Do you have heals for them?
5. Rotate as team and stick together.
6. Engage the enemy if fired upon or make sure your team is ready to do so. Focus firing as a team on the same player will melt the best of players.
7. Do not go for the revive if the other team is pushing and is closer than sniper range. At most. Box your downed player in to prevent an easy thirst and fight back.
8. Do not pop a chug jug or a med kit if your teammates are still engaged and especially outnumbered. Expecting a teammate to defend themselves against multiple shooters for 10 to 15 seconds is extremely selfish. Your health may be low but your weapons still work and you may sneak shots in to create a better opportunity for your surviving members.
9. Do not drop Tilted if your K/D is negative. You can barely handle an even fight yet alone getting third partied.
10. Do not stand still out in the open. It makes you an easy target.
11. Do not get tunnel vision on one player or team exposing yourself for an easy third party.
12.  When building cover. Do not just build in one direction of you current engagement. Cover your back and sides and if you are near high ground put a roof on too.
13. If your teammate gives you heals and you're hurt. Use them. I have actually been paired with players who refuse to heal when safe after a battle multiple times. As if they didn't know healing is an option.
14. Do not make unnecessary noise. Shooting for no reason or getting in vehicles when you don't need them as means of travel just because you like them. Noise alerts enemies. Getting the first big shot or knock in a battle usually determines the outcome.
15. Do not break or edit friendly structures in a way to deal fall damage to a teammate.
16. Do not blow up or boom box not looted structures that have no enemies in them. The amount of times I've watched an unopened chest break is very concerning. Note. Also do not tunnel up from directly under a chest. I can't believe I felt the need to type this.
17. If your team is getting caught in the storm and you have a mobility item such such as rift or launch pad. Make sure they can get to it too. Also do not place launch pads under trees or other objects.
18. If you not trying to win or going for challenges. Play solo or LTMs. If not the strangers you match make with. Will hate you.
19. Storm management. Pay attention to the timer and distance needed to the next safe zone. Know how much damage per tick the storm does for each circle. Know how long it takes on foot to travel one square on the map. Horizontally vertically and diagonally. If you can't make it on foot know where vehicles spawns are or rift locations.
20. Pick battles based off the storm. How much time is left? Are you inside or outside the next safe zone? How fast can you wrap that battle up? Any engagement that puts you into the storm you should do your best to avoid. Unlike players, the storm doesn't miss.
21. Carry loot as a team. Everyone should have a shotgun and AR. But as for heals and mobility items stack them. Why have say 2 minis on 3 player slots when you can put 6 on 1 player slot? Also give the player with the explosive weapon all your rockets. Heavy ammo to the sniper. Light ammo to the minigunner. If you'e not using that type. Maximize those 20 slots.

I’m interested to hear how everyone else feels about the game itself currently (good, bad or impartial).","I’ll start by saying I love Fortnite! This game has been pretty much the only 1 I’ve spent (a shit load) of time playing since I started back in season 3. 

Why am I not enjoying this game anymore? I guess it could be the fact that inevitably when you hammer a game so much you will eventually get bored of it, but I don’t believe it is that which has made me not want to play as much recently. 

I haven’t played at all since the update last week and S7 has been the first one where I haven’t played on an almost daily basis. There’s a long list of things I like, things I hate and things I have no real opinion on regarding the newer stuff that’s been added, it’s too long so I won’t include it here but maybe in the comments if the discussion opens up. 

I also want to say, I have absolutely no issue with the changing meta, I like change and embrace ways to keep the game fresh but some of this shit is just wild to me, that being said some of it is really cool to me also. 

Yes, I know it’s as simple as ‘well just don’t play it then, but because I’ve put SOOOO many hours into this game and also (embarrassingly) a load of £$€, it kinda sucks that I’ve invested so much into this game only for its developers to take it in such a terrible direction (imo of course). 

I would genuinely love to talk to people on either side of the fence and those who don’t really have a strong opinion either way. I do feel like I’m seeing more and more people begin to stop playing this as much, if that’s the case for you then why? What is it that’s making you not want to play? On the flip side if you’re loving the game more than ever at the moment then I would like to hear your thoughts too. ",FortNiteBR

3. It’s way too OP, how can a gun with 7 bullets and a fast reload speed destroy wood with one shot and also do 75 body and 150 headshot damage? Don’t u think that this gun is too good to be in the game? It is also super easy to use and is obtainable very easily.

This appeals to neither of my casual or competitive loves for this game.,"I’ve played since October 2017. I ditched Destiny 2 when it got stale and started having a blast with Fortnite. 

I would consider myself a casual but also competitive. I enjoy messing around with new additions to the game (except the sword ew). But I also love to compete. Ive played game battles tournaments, playground 1v1s, pop-ups, etc with a 3.5 ish lifetime k/d. 

There have been 3 times that I’ve stopped playing this game. 

First was Fortnitemares. I liked the addition for shield and loot purposes. They were a non-rng way of shielding up early game. However, the competitive side of me couldn’t stand them after the second circle. I couldn’t stand fighting people with zombies breaking my builds,  making it unable to get high ground or heal up low ground. 

Second time was obviously the sword. Wasn’t even fun to use and obviously it was always there in the late game. 

Third time is today. I was hopeful for an LTM. I would’ve played it a few times for the experience, but I still enjoy playing normal modes more. I have no intention of raging at these zombies mid-late game again. 

I’m a mix of both casual and competitive and I don’t see how Epic can’t see how it’s ruining the experience for its core players. ",FortNiteBR

Trust me, I hate the zombies as much as the next guy, but we shouldn't be taking this out on Epic.

Epic had their theme for this season in the mythical items, the first being the sword. Rightfully so, there was a lot of backlash about the ability of this sword and the lack of ability to combat it. With that, there were a lot of complaints to epic from streamers to redditors. Once Epic realized their mistake, they admitted their fault, and removed the sword and the rest of the mythical items they had planned for this season.

That moves us onto what happened today. After the player base trashed their mythical item idea, Epic needed to come up with a new ""theme"" for season 7. I am sure they put a lot of work into their original plan, and to scratch it as quickly as they did to please the player base shows a lot. Once the theme was scratched, they were back to the drawing board and needed to come up with something new. A ""new"", easy, solution is the event that unfolded today with the Ice King. Have him turn the map into snow, create a lot of fog, and bring back the zombies but make them ice themed. This was an easy solution because the game was already programmed and coded for these interactions (fortnightmares and the snow covered map on Christmas). 

As I said before, I am not a fan of the zombies, but this all occurred because Epic was basically forced to remove their mythical item theme due to the backlash from the community. I'm sure they worked as quickly as possible to make a change for us, which they did. ",FortNiteBR

Firstly it would be nice if epic finally implemented a mode to watch these events that can't be ruined by others eliminating you. Every event there's always ""them"" that go all out to ruin someone's viewing.

Anyway my main point is that this event imo was the worst event epic have done. Waiting and waiting just for that !! Needed more effort, very poor event.

Yes I know ""you'll"" say I'm only mad because i got killed / missed the event !! I'm not, it happens I know and I think epic need to address that. I've seen the event and in my opinion it was very disappointing.

Anyone else think it was a poor or did you enjoy it ? ",FortNiteBR

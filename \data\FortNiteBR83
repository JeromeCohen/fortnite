I play it very often and don't really play much else. No, I'm not burnt out from playing or anything like that: the amount of time I have played this season is consistent with the rest. But this season when compared to the others, in my opinion quite frankly isn't even comparable. This season as a whole just wasn't all that exciting to me and I can't be the only one. Planes are indescribably annoying, this battle pass had some of the least exciting/interesting skins and the events of this season were super underwhelming in comparison to events like the meteors from season 3, the rocket from season 4, and even the cube event from season 6. The cracks are super basic and you cant even se them or know that they're there unless you are in close proximity or flying over them. The could have been much more destructive and changed the look of buildings, trees and the landscape. You know... like an earthquake. Now we are just going to get a cinematic event of the volcano erupting. How awesome would that have been in game? I'm really not a fan of the POI's on the South Eastern part of the map for this season and apparently most people aren't either as most of the time it's really just empty unless the circle ends up there. But it's not ALL bad. Sure I loved the huge 7.4 update that brought all the great changes. Driftboards are FANTASTIC and I'm so glad the silenced SMG came back. But outside of that, there is nothing about this season that is memorable TO ME. So for me, it's so long and good ridance season 7. I can't wait for season 8! See you guys out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL; DR:  For me personally I'm so glad season 7 ends today. Many on this sub say it's their favorite season but I disagree. I can't wait for season 8 tomorrow! ",FortNiteBR

Although it may not say it is bound to R3 (in build or edit), the R3 function acts as sprint in those modes.

So if I take my traps out and try to cycle through them using R3 my character will actually walk every time I cycle my trap (auto run is on, which means sprint would do the opposite)

If you change R3 to pickaxe it will also change it for the other modes with the only difference of it actually being displayed as ‚Äúpickaxe‚Äù as oppose to ‚Äúunbound‚Äù

SBMM is not a Ranked MODE. You guys need to be extremely careful what you ask for. If they introduce an extremely strict SBMM to default lobbies, you all will be crying here in no time as the true sweat mode is enabled without a possibility of parole. 

You people also need to understand that a 24/7 ranked mode that you dream about is likely impossible to implement. A ranked MODE split at least to 6 different ranks, between all 3 platforms, 6 regions and 3 modes (squad,duo,solo). 

There is a reason why all platforms are queued together in the popup cups. There is a reason why it's available only at given hours. The mode that you dream about is not achievable without 1 hour queue times at the top ranks.

I understand the battle royale concept.

What confuses me is the actual nature of the game. It's like it's trying to be an MMO, but also trying to be a battle royale.

I mean the crux of the each round is kill people, and be the last one alive. But there are all these challenges, all these changes to scenery, story lines. Stuff you collect. Quests. Events.

All the things they;re doing, and alot of the playerbase would seem to be happier if they were in the save the world game, but with all those changes happening. I don't think the actual BR stuff is important at all for them.

The actual Br players wouldn't give a shit if the map was barren and they started with the same weapons and max building materials and were dropping in a small arena.",FortNiteBR

Absolutely no one made a dent with a tiny 100% XP boost.  Let's break it down.  

-408,000XP at 2,000XP per match on good matches = 204 matches

-204 matches at 20 mins each means 68 hours straight of gameplay.  

-68 hours, that's right, 68 hours of gameplay WITH 100% XP boost just to go from 90-100.  

So who was this XP event even for?  No one was able to make a dent in their levels with this tiny XP boost.  You need to make it 300% or 400% if you want us to make any sort of progress, because unless we were level 97-98 none of us made it to level 100 with these 100% bonus events. ",FortNiteBR

Give me the days where you can ride a shopping cart and dance with a stranger. The game now is unplayable for your casual gamer. And for a game that seems to disrespect their competitive players as much as they do...they do a great job disrespecting the casual gamer as well.

**Motorcycle**

Ride in style! Pop a wheelie as you boost, or fall to one side to slide under builds and bullets!

**Burst Sniper Rifle**

Three shots are better than one! Don‚Äôt worry about headshots when you can pop three body shots!

**Zap Trap**

Shock your enemies ‚Äì literally! This new Trap gives you time to line up a headshot or unload a clip into someone!

LIMITED TIME MODES

*Note: Following our new rotation schedule for LTMs, these three LTMs will roll out over the next week.*

SHARPSHOOTER

**Summary**

Fight for the Victory Royale using only Pistols! Take careful aim and make every shot count!

**Mode Details**

* Only Pistol-class weapons spawn in this mode.
* Damage falloff has been removed for this mode.

HEALING WAVES

**Summary**

If you survive to see a new eye of the storm appear, you‚Äôll be healed to full health and full shield! The storm giveth and the storm taketh away!

**Mode Details**

* No healing items spawn in this mode.
* Players receive no effective health for eliminations in this mode. To compensate, eliminated players drop stacks of 100 Materials, instead of stacks of 50.
* Players start the game with full health and full shield, and they return to this point every time a new storm circle forms.
* Overhauled the Storm for this mode
   * The Storm now decelerates instead of accelerating. This means the first phase is the fastest and the last phase is the slowest.
   * Adjusted storm circle sizes for deceleration
   * Late game storm circles no longer form outside the current Safe Zone.

SOLID GOLD FOOD FIGHT

**Summary**

Be the first team to destroy the enemy team‚Äôs mascot, using nothing but Gold weapons! Talk about fine dining!

**Mode Details**

* Only Legendary Weapons spawn in this mode. Explosive Weapons remain unavailable.

**What‚Äôs New?**

* The mascots no longer damage themselves over time. After 15 minutes, the mascot that has taken the most damage will now self-destruct. In the highly unlikely case that it is a tie, both mascots self-destruct and both teams claim the Victory Royale.
* Extended impenetrable barrier uptime from 5 minutes to 7 minutes 30 seconds
* Raised Material cap from 999/999/999 to 1500/1500/1500
* There are now 5 waves of Red Supply Drops, spaced 5 minutes apart. The first one still spawns at the start of the match.
* Each restaurant now comes with 3 Mounted Turrets already placed out front. Mounted Turrets still spawn as loot, so the free ones can be replaced if they get destroyed. However, Mounted Turrets can no longer be placed anywhere else in this mode.
* Players now respawn higher, but the ceiling that forces skydiving players to deploy their Gliders has been lowered.
* Each player now also earns XP based on the damage they deal to the enemy mascot.

GAMEPLAY

* Motorcycle
   * Added Motorcycle Vehicle
   * Controls
      * Tap Interact to mount and dismount.
      * Hold Primary Fire to drive.
      * Tap Alternative Fire to brake.
      * Hold Alternative Fire to reverse slowly. Reversing on a bike is hard!
      * Tap Jump to boost and pop a wheelie.
      * Hold Jump to maintain boosted speed indefinitely. However, maintaining that wheelie makes the Motorcycle harder to control. If the player loses control, they fall off and take some damage.
      * Tap Left/Right Bumper (Z/C on PC) to lean to one side.

on pc, in season 4 i could keep a constant 60fps with shadows on and everything else off and my default 3d resolution, which is 1600x900. season 5 rolled around and i could no longer keep 60fps with shadows on. so i had to turn my 3d resolution down to 1280x720. season 6 it was the same issue. i dealt with it at like 45-50fps (dont know how) and in season 7, the first thing i noticed was the fps drop. i can no longer keep 60fps with shadows on or off. I turn off shadows, keep default resolution and get about 50 fps. when i turn the 3d res down, i still canr keep 60fps. places like loot lake, dusty diner, and the b.l.o.ck make me get like 45 fps. I'm afraid of how much worse its going to get in season 8...

now onto switch. i played on switch back in august and it was optimized pretty well. then i stopped playing on switch and went back to pc. when i came back to my switch in season 7, performance was worse. graphics looked more pixely and they dont look as smooth as they first did when it released in june. it was actually pretty decent. up until season 7. it was tolerable, but now sonce the v7.40 patch released, you get like micro stutters and the graphics are so bad now. they are like even worse. also, we dont even have weapon stats! like pn pc or xbox or ps4 when you look at an ite in your inventory you can see weapon damage, fire rate, reload time, etc. all switch shows is dps.

i will keep posting this until it gets fixed, because I shouldn't have to go out and buy a new pc because you guys fail to optimize your game.",FortNiteBR

**Why it is overrated:**

  - It's the dream of everyone who is begging ""bRinG bAcK dRuM gUN!"", it's a nostalgic thing, I get that, but the mode overall is incredibly unbalanced in many ways.

  - It's easy. The best way to do well in the mode is to pick up multiple Drum Guns or LMGs and spam your heart out. The LMG will tear through like ~30 walls in one magazine, and the Drum Gun has better damage and accuracy overall than ARs or even the P90... You can complain about the vaulted weapons forever because they were vaulted for a reason.

**Why I dislike it:**

  - Overall it's not balanced: Like I said before, it's a spamfest, there's weapons that are terrible (sorry pistol and burst rifle) compared to other ones, so basically when you land you have a 50/50 chance of being completely screwed over by garbage loot, or you're able to clear your drop spot with 2 mags of a Drum Gun.

  - It takes very little skill to do well: Spamming is in no way a skill, the Drum Gun, LMG, and Tac SMG are the weapons that shine in that mode, and they all require to be spammed to be used correctly. There is a lack of skillful guns, the pistol, even though it's garbage takes a ton of skill to be used well, along with the Bolt sniper, since it's a squad mode, you can be overwhelmed by just two people (by being spammed and the other is actually trying to shoot you), making the bolt pretty well useless unless you're 3rd partying or catching someone off-guard.

  - **It has actual flaws, quite a bit of them:**

  - The traps are incorrect. The Campfire, Spike Trap, and even the Turret are in the mode, which none are actually vaulted, meanwhile it has the Bouncers and Freeze Traps, but seemingly no launch pad for some reason?

  - Rockets don't exist? I've found an RPG many times throughout many games and never once had I received a rocket (ammo) besides the one it came loaded with and the one it dropped with.

  - Dynamite is in the mode, dynamite hasn't been vaulted in the default game, but yet it exists in the Unvaulted LTM and isn't a core item that is required in the game

  - Redeploy is available, but again, no launch pad? Redeploy is just too easy to use and is a 'free pass' to make up for mistakes that would have costed you the game, and it's a very easy way to travel across the map, being quicker than 2 of the vehicles in the game.",FortNiteBR

I understand it's a controversial topic but please, just take a read?

Under what circumstances, either plausible or not, do you believe that the Battle Passes of yonder seasons to come back in a way that seems fair?

I have a few ideas:

Monetization:

- Minimum of 3000 V-Bucks
This is because it had a time, and you missed it, so you're going to suffer for it. A lower price of 950 for the free pass could also be offered to everyone.

- Only those who previously purchased the previous battle pass have access to this option, to keep the pool of those who were playing at the time consistent. 

- Anyone who completed the Battlepass, gets a free set of overtime challenges. Everyone else has to pay maybe 950 V-Bucks for it. Again, if you waste your time, you're gonna waste your money for a second chance.

Respekt the OGs:

- All challenges remain the same. If that challenge is currently impossible, rough. No loading screen or secret skin for you.

- The previously mentioned overtime challenges for free.

- One final loading screen

- Anyone with the season's corresponding umbrella gets a similar wrap.

- A pretty nice numbered banner that sums up the season for our max tier friends.
eg. A Knight's Shield with a two on it for Season Two 

Balanced. As all things should be

- The Season available for purchase is on a monthly/bimonthly rotation, and lasts as long as the current season. Both are gone after that season. 

- Only one Battle Please can be ""equipped"" at a time, and switching is on a daily cooldown. XP can be shared however. Get grinding. This wouldn't apply to overtime challenges.

That's all folks

- What do you think? How would your dream nightmare scenario go? 

-I know the likelyhood of it happening was as low as Epic listening to the community before Apex, but in the alternate universe it did, how would you see it ideally?

Nerf building, buff building counters, and add wackier items.  That way being a sweat will still give you an advantage but not so much so that Fortnite stops being a tactical/strategic game.  The focus on building and shotguns as a meta has become stale anyway.

Fortnite could keep three consist game modes  and the 1 other rotational LTM open at all time besides the normal Solos, Duos, and Squads: Playground, Team Rumble, and Unvaulted. (And of course, whichever LTM is available at that time.) The Unvaulted mode gives the old players a chance to use the guns they loved and it gives the new players a chance to use the guns they heard their OF Fortnite friends rave about! Another suggestion is every time a gun/item gets vaulted, if it‚Äôs not some crazy ridiculous gun, they could just put that gun in Unvaulted so the people that love the gun/item could still use it. It‚Äôs a great way to reminisce, and it‚Äôs an all-around enjoyable mode. If the guys at Epic Games could just consider this request, that would be super cool! Just a suggestion

He told me everything about season 7 and parts of 8. We made up a little bit into season 7 and he told me more information. No we have not fallen out again but I am deciding to reveal the information as the teasers are very cryptic.

Season 8:

A huge earthquake will crack through Polar Peak and the snow biome causing it all to turn to dust. The polar peak castle will fall and it's remains will remain a location to visit though not named. Greasy Grove will return but with a new building instead of the Durr restaurant. What the earthquake also did was trigger an tidal wave submerging the top left of the map. Junk Junction will be replaced by crystal caves and the eerie House by Pleasent Park will be destroyed with the addition of Jackpot Jungles, a huge jungle with a casino replacing the sports town near Tilted Towers. The front of wailing Woods will be completely burnt and the back will be a volcano slowly growing through the season. The snake eggs hatch and a new LTM will be released 1 week into the season which players will battle the snakes for loot. Only supply drops give guns and only uncommon weapons come from them (the snakes give legendary). Vaulted+Unvaulted items include:

Minigun
Compact smg 
Tactical Shotgun 
Planes 
Chug Jugs
Stink bombs  
Tactical Smg 
Light machine gun (lmg)
Smoke grenades

Season 9:

From what I know plans to fill in Dusty Divot are in place and Dusty Depot may be returning. The water biome will be removed and lucky landing will be replaced with a beach and villa location. ",FortNiteBR

2- if not reward us for winning a game, 25 vbucks or something.. give us something to fight for 
3- with unvaulted being back....drum gun(bae) I want to see you return on all modes
4- be able to respawn(since planes are going, change the outpost into a respawn area) 

There‚Äôs more but...

How much longer do we have to wait until we get a proper Ranked Mode?

I'm a fairly shit player. Possibly below average, average at best. For the past month or so, I'm getting put against some insanely highly-skilled players.

(I'm on console - if that's relevant)

The past 2 games were a nightmare, I got killed by someone that finished the game with 19 kills and the next game, I got killed by someone who had 11 kills after killing me.

I don't play the game as much as I used to, but damn, this shit is way too hard to keep up. These people are insanely fast builders, very good accuracy, very fast and smooth edits. 

I want to be put with people that are within my skill-range.

Picture me, hanging out and playing some Vidya Games. I try out Fortnite at about season 2 and immediately think ""wow, this is... a thing.""

Season 3 rolls around and my friends will not stop asking me to play. Whatever. If my friends want me to play it, I'll play it. You know what? It was bad. I didn't enjoy it. I kept playing anyways. I got better. 

Alright, picture me now. Sitting there, enjoying the game. What changed? I have no clue. It just became... Fun. Some of the stupid gimmicks are removed. The map is changed. I finally enjoy a game I used to hate with a burning passion.

So hey, keep this in mind. You don't like a game? Give a game a retry and some time before you hate on it. 

Peace.

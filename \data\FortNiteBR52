I decided to be nice and dropped his Arena Mode points back down to zero by suiciding repeatedly off the bus.

My brother comes over, I tell him what I did, and he gets excited and jumps on.  The first game on, he makes it to the top 5 and gets killed by a player with 31 kills in the match.

While gaming isn't going to affect what I need or how much I'm going to spend, I would like to at least consider the possibility of buying something that would also accommodate my casual Fortnite playing.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently play on Xbox, so I would assume that basically any modern laptop is going to perform better with Fortnite than my Xbox does at the moment.  Is that a fair assumption, or will some laptops simply not be able to handle Fortnite?  \*(Note:  I realize that PC lobbies are tougher than console lobbies, but that's not of concern since I'm mostly going to be playing creative with friends and family).\*

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't settled on the exact laptop just yet, but \[something like this\]( [http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1548224&amp;csid=\_21](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=1548224&amp;csid=_21) ) for around $400 is what I'm leaning towards.

Siphon on elimination was probably best thing to happen to this game, because constant third party was such an issue. When siphon on elimination was introduced in v7.40, it actually gave people who just came out of a fight at low health a chance to fight back against that annoying third party, whether it be the third party is rushing you out shooting at you from afar.

Epic claims to have removed siphon because of “too much aggressive play.” Even after siphon was removed, I feel absolutely no difference as far as aggressive play goes. I still experience the same amount of aggressive play.

Not only is siphon a reward for killing someone, it also gives victims of third party a chance. Not at all is it fair to come out of a fight with 20 HP and no mats, and get rushed by someone with 100 health and 100 shield and has 1.5K mats.

Please Epic. Listen to your community.

Don’t tell me “it’s a vocal minority”

No it isn’t. A big majority doesn’t like these constant updates but not everyone goes on reddit or bothers enough to care, I know many people who loved this game say in S4 or S3 but starting with zombies in S6 they refuse to play it

Along with that, this same thing happened to games like Halo or H1Z1. Halo is the most comparable I’d say cause back in Halo 3 and Halo Reach it was arguably a huge franchise then came Halo 4 and killed it and Halo 5 just crushed it.

These constant bugs being piled over top of each other and many forgotten even, dumb additions (which might be say good items, but aren’t at all needed or even beneficial to metas and changing them or anything for the most part), and ultimately ruining the streamer community since a lot of streamers now complain will kill this game.

I promise you, if S9 and S10 go anymore downhill than it’s been going this game is gonna be forgotten next year and just a thing of the past.",FortNiteBR

So figured why not use all my PS4 stuff on the switch while it transfers over.  

If I had to sum up my whole experience in just a single word it would be “infuriating”

I can’t express how much I dislike playing on the switch. Like borderline hate it. Now, I’ve previously spoken about how I hate the switch version, but didn’t feel i gave it a fair chance. I feel now I’ve given more than enough of my time to formulate a better opinion. 

The 30fps is an obvious drawback, especially if your coming console or pc, but it’s not be all or end all honestly. The game actually stays at that, it’s totally playable and you can land your shots. However, because the game is so unoptimised for switch, it becomes absolute mess. Out of all of the games I’ve played which was over 100 by the way, I can’t tell you the amount of times the game failed to fully load structures or just the map in general. Dusty divot for example (my go to landing spot) NEVER loaded for me upon landing there. I’d always be floating in some sort of void where i couldn’t interact with the ground or any buildings, just waiting for someone that was fortunate enough for their game to load to kill me.  That single handily (for me at least) made playing on the switch torture. From what I can tell it’s actually more stable playing an a decent phone/tablet. I used my Samsung note 9, And it so much more reliable to say the least. I know I may come across and moaning, and I guess I am. The switch port just feels like an after thought, all these updates and the game just seems stay in this state where is unplayable at times. It’s ridiculous. I don’t know how they possible fix it, if it even can be. Maybe it’s the switch itself, I don’t know. But what I do know is if you own fortnite on switch and have ANY OTHER device to play it on, play on that. You’ll be better off for sure. ",FortNiteBR

So I want the Omega Lights to return. So do a lot of people. But i wanted to know just how many people want these challenges to return. Even if you don't see these skins much in game, I feel like that is because people feel ashamed running around as an Incomplete Omega and or Carbide. Which is why I propose this poll. I want to submit this to Epic Themselves, so I will ask that everyone will please answer the questions truthfully, and so they can see how we all feel about this very controversal topic.

&amp;#x200B;

I also asked a bonus question in this poll, on the Oblivion and Criterion Emissive Lights. Should they have Styles too, to match Omega and Carbide?

&amp;#x200B;

I would greatly appreciate it if we had a lot of people submit a response for this. I am trying to have Epic see what the whole community thinks about this topic.

if for whatever reason the poll link doesn't show, you can find it here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaoBCjXO\_RTP5DVJS3ynqmMVgXrJ4tg-9TDQW4zuAAsGwCww/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfaoBCjXO_RTP5DVJS3ynqmMVgXrJ4tg-9TDQW4zuAAsGwCww/viewform?usp=sf_link)

2: Purple Scoped AR
In recent months we have had guns that reward us with good aim. If that’s the questionable Scoped Revolver or the AK-47, I feel like the skill gap doesn’t only consist only of building anymore. As seen by players like Tfue or Comikazie, the Scoped AR can shred. But waaayyy not enough damage. Purple Scoped AR? Yes please.  In OG Fortnite, it was one if the best guns.

Here was Epic moving from a Vanilla state to a TOO rewarding version of the game where being the better player(s) rewarded you with a 50 heal to either shield or health(prioritized health). 

I understand that PUB games became a monstrosity of over-aggressiveness and for casuals it's hard to progess in skill when everyone and their little sisters on the switch are W-Keying the entire lobby because they aren't afraid of taking damage. It definitely leads to frustrating times, and is overall just not as fun to KEEP playing if you're not that good at the game.

HOWEVER, good players or even the not so well endowed players who get eliminations should be rewarded for their triumphant endeavors. 
We all know how frustrating it is NOW to be in a fight and you lay the people's elbow on some fool who just so happened to lay a kamehameha shotgun smack that left you naked and afraid. The worst part? You hear Kodak Blacks 'ZeZe' in the background and some fool(s) lands on you only to finish the job with his own kamehameha smackdown. And you know for sure that even though he beat you and you hit them for 95, if you had anymore health than the measly 44 Hp you were left with, you would have charged that elbow up again and layed the smackdown. 

So my solutions are quite simple. They reward players that win fights with the opportunity to get into another fight, not at full capacity, but with enough health to know that a pump in the butt from 20 meters isn't going to make you yell at your parents(Sorry Mom). 

Solutions:
Remove only bandages from item rotation and add one of the following:

Upon receiving an elimination, the enemy will 100% drop 5 bandages along with their loot

Or

Every player starts off with 5 bandages

Wow, Buwoop, why didn't you just say that? Because this is serious business and as much as I love this game, I don't enjoy it enough to keep playing if nothing is going to progress. The worst part is my friends are no longer enjoying the game because of how the mat gathering system is now, and because getting into team fights before endgame is almost worthless now.

I seriously hope this doesn't get left in the dust of the NEW section. Please share your thoughts on the idea. Please keep it civil. ",FortNiteBR

In this i just want to discuss Mythical Outfits, Gliders, Pickaxes and Backblings.

My idea for mythical cosmetics is that they have certain advantages, balanced by disadvantages. For example, a shorter outfit with a shorter hitbox, but it has less speed. These would be good for specific tactics. If you prefer spray &amp; pray, there could be a larger ammunition round, but a longer reload time for SMG weapons. 

Here are some possible ideas for advantages/disadvantages for these specific cosmetics:

**Outfit Advantages**

1. GOTTA GO *FAST!* (Speed increase by 5% to 10%)
2. I am the small one (90%-75% size)
3. Marksman (Sniper / bow opponent damage increased (5%-10%)
4. Holy Sprayer (Less bloom on Auto weapons)
5. Healthy (Health increase by 10 to 25)
6. Pre-Battle Drink (10 to 25)

**Outfit Neutral Effects**

1. Bulky (Health increase but bigger model and hitbox)
2. Ninja (Speed increases but bloom increases)
3. Constructor (Able to upgrade buildings to level 2 and reload speed increased, but movement speed decreased and larger model)
4. Lightweight (Less fall damage, more jump height but less freefall downward speed, minigun knockback introduced, more knockback for things with normal knockback)
5. Heavyweight (Faster freefall, no flintknock knockback but more fall damage, less jump height)

**Outfit Disadvantages**

1. I don't like this (Health/shield decrease by 10 to 25)
2. THE BURN (Campfires don't heal, lava damage increased)
3. I can't go on that fast... (Speed decrease by 5% to 10%)
4. Dummy! (Teammates can hurt you)
5. Wield the blade! (You get a nerfed version of the Infinity Blade)
6. It's Nerf or... Nerf. (Less gun damage dealt to opponents)

**Glider Advantages**

1. Shhh... (Glider ambient noise removed)
2. Low Rider (Deploys lower than usual)
3. Anti-Thermal (You don't pick up on thermal scope while in gliding state)
4. Spiked Glider (Coming into contact with an enemy damages them for 1hp)

**Glider Neutral Effects**

1. Sacrificial Buff (Sacrifices glider speed for immortality when gliding)
2. In the matrix (Your glider gets speed but will teleport randomly)
3. Paraglider (You can slow your fall by going from side to side)

**Glider Disadvantages**

1. The boogie is too powerful! (You can get boogied mid-air)
2. Gotta Glide (Glider deploys at a higher altitude)
3. Speed? No. (Speed decrease)
4. Turn it down! (Glider ambient noise louder)

**Pickaxe Advantages**

1. Quick Miner (Harvest rate increased)
2. OOF (+5 (or +10) Player damage)
3. MORE MATERIALS! (Materials gathered 150%)

**Pickaxe Disadvantages**

1. Heavy Pickaxe (Harvest rate decreased)
2. Inexperienced Melee (-5/10 player damage)
3. Not harvest season (Mats gathered 50%)

**Backbling Advantages**

1. Build with me! (Material limit increased to 1099 or 1199)
2. Advanced Traps (Damage traps deal more damage, Freezer +5 seconds, Campfire + 7.5 seconds, Bouncer + Launchpad launch you 10m further)
3. Bulk (+1 or 2 item slots)

**Backbling Neutral Effects**

1. Bigger Bag (Bulk + E N L A R G E)
2. Taj Mahal! (Build with me! + Wooden you like this?)
3. Stick to originals. (Advanced Traps + Origins)

**Backbling Disadvantages**

1. E N L A R G E (Your backbling gets a hitbox)
2. Wooden you like this? (Wood only)
3. Origins (Spike Trap and Launchpad only)

2. As soon as someone gets a gun they just start pushing; they don't even stop to loot because they can potentially get shield off of a kill. There were so many times where someone would push me off spawn with one gun, and kill me, and then immediately after get killed by someone else. Because they don't care about dying they just want that one kill. I think that's rediculous. 

3. By the time the first circle closed, there would be 30 or less people. I looked back at gameplay from before health on kill and there were generally at least 50-60 people alive after the first circle. 

What do you guys think about these points and how they have affected the game?

Do you want health on kill back?",FortNiteBR

Why wouldn’t you want the best features from other games implemented into a game you already play and love?

Fortnite has changed their lives and they sit there and complain. Fortnite is unlike any other game ever released abd their success means they are able to put 100mil up for grabs. 

I seriously have never seen a more entitled group of individuals. Do you have a better chance of winning the lottery versus winning the World Cup... probably... but imagine complaining about get a Free chance at winning the lotto! 

Fortnite doesn’t owe anybody anything. They clearly don’t want a “Pro” community and have made it clear that they want any average Jonesy to have a chance. 

If any of you aren’t ok with this, uninstall the game and go play an inferior game with an inferior developer who doesn’t give you the chance to win millions. Cheers everyone.",FortNiteBR

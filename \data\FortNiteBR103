As a controller player myself, I find that there is some reason to this but not enough to remove aim assist entirely. However, the more I thought about it, the more I think of a perfect solution to this.

On PC, ADS spamming should get nerfed as most of the clips showing the ADS spamming is on PC with a controller. However since I am on Xbox, I found that ADS spamming doesn‚Äôt really work as Aim Assist doesn‚Äôt work as well as I feel it should. This should get fixed and be more balanced because on PC you have a choice and should be fixed there. On console, however, you really don‚Äôt get a choice. 

(And don‚Äôt give me that you have a choice because if you plug in your keyboard and mouse you still get into PC lobbies, unlike PC which still put you in PC lobbies.) 

Again, I‚Äôm not saying that Aim Assist should be removed entirely, that‚Äôs stupid. What I am saying is that it should be more balanced to be more equal with how Aim Assist SHOULD work. ",FortNiteBR

This might not be the right subreddit but I get literally no response on subs dedicated to gaming laptops. If this post isn't allowed here, I have no problem with it being removed.

I'm thinking about buying a HP Omen 15 laptop (i7-7700HQ, Nvidia GTX 1060, 16GB RAM). I currently play Fortnite on a PS4, and since I need a new laptop I was thinking about spending some extra money to get a gaming laptop. I've read a lot of good things about the HP Omen 15 and its specs are the best I can get for my budget.

Does anyone has experience with Fornite on a HP Omen 15 or a laptop with similar specs? How would it compare to playing on a 5-year old PS4, and how much FPS could I get out of it, if I connect it to my 144Hz monitor? I don't know if it's worth the extra money over a normal laptop. If it isn't, I'll just stick with playing on my PS4.

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",FortNiteBR

There are now significantly more weapons, consumables and items that vie for a slot in our main inventory.

And don't get me wrong.. That's awesome, that's part of the game-- choosing one item over another is a strategy that adds an awesome depth to Fortnite.

HOOOOOOOWEVER...

I think we've come to the point that there are so many items the game, that it warrants a new LTM that tests the concept of a sixth slot. I anticipate it could be done in one of two ways:

1. This is the most obvious: just add a sixth slot, my guy. Boom. Set. Done. Easy enough.
2. The ""backpack slot"". This would enable players to pick up an item and store it in their backpack. You still have five active slots that you can use hotkeys to switch between, but to use your inactive item you must swap it for an item that's currently in your main slot. TLDR: One slot in the backpack just to store items that you cannot hotkey to.

Would love to hear your thoughts!

I believe that the viral video did not justify the issues faced by console players. The aim lock only happens when both players are standing still. The current aim assist is perfect in my opinion, it serves the plastic thumb sticks with less than 10 centimetres movement correctly. No hate, but the PC players are only bashing on console players since the skill gap is closing down. Even the best of the best console players still are not on the same level as PC players. We have limited amount of buttons that have multiple functions that we have to memorise. There are so many things which PC players have advantage over such as the previous double pump, or the new meta of 90s. If EpicGames makes the mistake of nerfing the aim assist, it would only reduce their motto of trying to obtain an equal level for all platform players. As a console player, if the aim assist is nerfed hugely, I believe it would only be right for EpicGames to completely prohibit stretched resolutions unless they are willing to bring them to other platforms.

Now my question here is, if this was such a problem, so OP, and such a game changer, why aren't controller players making a million bucks from these tournaments? It's a simple answer, because of the fact that kbm still has an infinite number of advantages (including aiming ability, joysticks and thumbs vs wrist, arm, finger and twenty buttons on a mouse). The only time I'd say aim assist ADS spam is an issue would be on PC where frame rates are much better. So a slight nerf to that for controller on PC is understandable, but for people who play on the miserable frame drops of console, this nerf is going to make the game frustrating as hell. But it is good to know that if pc streamers complain enough about something, it'll get nerfed.",FortNiteBR

""GROUND BREAKING SEASON 7 theory:

The backbling of deadfire aka the cube backbling, has been glowing up instantly when going to polar peak and u can try it yourself if u don‚Äôt believe me. Well there are four possible reasons to explain this. 1. There is an old ruin under where polar peak is currently at. Also the place where the prisoner was held had an outer border and it is the exact size and shape as the cube once was. Next, the ice king summoned zombies while holding a shard in a cube like shape, the only thing able to harness zombies was the cube. So it is possible the ice king is harnessing the cubes power from underneath polar peak itself. But that‚Äôs not it, in the lobby if u emote where your player goes down, you can see a distant cube shape in the background behind frosty flights. Right where polar peak should be! And on top of that, Donald mustard, (leading developer of fortnite) tweeted and said that there is definitely something underneath the ice burg aka polar peak.""

He also added after that:

""What if when the cube exploded a piece of it went flying and landed on the iceburg that is polar peak and the reason it came to our island is because the cube is trying to re assemble itself and it can‚Äôt because the last piece is under ice and only when polar peak thaws is when the cube will return""

Then he added:

""The leaked earthquake event coming up is when the last shard of the cube finally forces itself out of the ice and causes an earthquake but then it flies to loot lake and the cube is reassembled and is left sitting in the middle of lootlake""

Remember, this is just a theory, a game theory. Thanks for reading :)",FortNiteBR

1. MATS! There‚Äôs a ton of trees, and the metal fences give you around 14 metal per fence. Also, there‚Äôs a rock farm a little ways northeast from Divot, feeding all your mats needs.

2. Small amounts of people(around 0-3 people total land here). This leaves you ample time to harvest and loot. It also helps prevent those BS early game fights, and even if you do run into some early game fights, the easy mats and huge amount of natural cover will help make those fights more fair.

3. Easy rotations. In this new comp scene, rotations are getting more and more important. Dusty is very close to the center of the map, and also had a zipline leading not only to the center(which has many more ziplines), but also an expedition outpost, hosting 4 plane spawns.

4. Non-rng health. Also in this new comp scene, health and shields are very important. It‚Äôs become a meme on how small the chances of getting heals is now(with the additions of dynamite, boomboxes, balloons, and gliders that clog up the med/shield pool), and Dusty‚Äôs got you covered. Not only is it littered with many mushrooms, but that rock farm northeast AND a little tree-rock area at the bottom has apples. The northeast rock farm is the biggest apple farm that I know of, of course excluding that one house in wailing.

There is one downside, which is tree fights. The trees are known to obscure your vision during fights, and they get in your way sometimes. This is only a problem mid-late game however, since they only become a problem when you have a lot of mats. Early game it‚Äôs a good thing you run into a tree since you won‚Äôt have many mats and it helps for cover.

My strategy: Land on the little bunker at the northwestern-most part of Divot(inside the fence area, not all of Divot). There‚Äôs almost always a floor loot spawn on the top of it, and to help prevent those 50-50 fights at the start of the game where two people land together, land on the tree and drop from there. Then, loot the bunker and pass onto the 4x4 white box, loot that. Head over to the floor loot spawn south of that, and just do whatever at that point. If there‚Äôs fighting, choose whether to engage or not. If there isn‚Äôt, continue to loot.

Just thought I‚Äôd take time to make a PSA about my favorite landing spot. It is an amazing place to drop, and I encourage you guys to give it a try.",FortNiteBR

Evidence: 

1. The Final loading screen in this battle pass was a picture of Dusty Depot. This itself could be evidence because epic likes to tease stuff like this and has done so before but in the background of this picture you can see snowy mountains that look very similar to the ones in the snowy part of the current map. (Also there is a picture of dusty in wailing without the snowy mountains which means epic did this purposefully)

2.  When unvaulted was in the game, the picture on the front of the game mode was players fighting each other in Dusty Depot. In the background of this picture there is a chest on top of one of the crates. This chest spawn did not ever exist in Dusty when it was in the game but in this loading screen it clearly shows a new chest spawn on top of the crate. One of the main problems with original Dusty was that it lacked chests. If epic brought this back they would need to add more loot to make it a viable location. This could be epic teasing the return of Dusty Depot with more loot and chests.

I started playing Fortnite back in October 2017, and it was all the rage at my school. Back in what was ""Season 1"", I played very little because I was bad, because I hadn't played xbox in a while. However, come December, Season 2, my friends laughed at how bad I was at the ""hit game"" so I started playing every night. I started getting quite good, and I had some of the best memories of my gaming career from January - March. Right around Season 4, I got a little worn out of Xbox Fortnite, but I still kept playing. Eventually, I would just play mobile Fort at school with my friends, bringing back some old fun. Summer came around, and I barely played in Season 5. Fast forward to Season 6 and I kinda got back into it, except this time I started playing PC. Eventually towards the very end of 6 and the beginning of Season 7, I found myself quite good at PC Fort. And so throughout Season 7 I've had a blast, getting the same feelings I got from Xbox Fortnite back in February 2017. Recently (like the past month), I've realized just how toxic this community is. Every Fortnite Instagram post has people claiming they're the best, shouting themselves out. Every game I play I get dominated by someone so sweaty I swear they never go outside. Any time I am knocked I get claimed instantly. I understand there are times and places to claim, but it has just become excessive at this point.


I will forever miss the Season 2 and Season 3 Fortnite, where everyone would post up in a 1 x 1 and shoot at each other across the fields. Now it's just who has the craziest, thickest ramp push and getting into the most intense build battle with insane edits and traps. I miss just being able to hop on and casually play, and talk and laugh, and not just sweat as hard as I can. 


So thank you, Fortnite, for bringing me an experience I thought I'd never live for, making new friends at school, all of it. When I look back at high school, Fortnite will be up there. Thanks :)",FortNiteBR

It helped a ton when fortnite vaulted the quad launcher, and I would be fine with rocket launchers honestly if they took out all this other pointless shit in the game. ",FortNiteBR

I was still bad, but I was getting a little better at the game, season 3 and 4 were great! But the rest came downhill. Season 5 started and I was excited to buy the battle pass. I loved the desert biome but something bad grew in fortnite. There were players overbuilding, defaults who had the battle pass and skins but for some reason decided to use the default, there were tryhards, sweats, and fake defaults. season 6 was worse! The amount of tryhards and fakers grew! I struggled to get challenges done! The players were toxic! But I loved the game I LOVED IT! And then December came and season 7 was no better, in fact worse.  I still struggle to get my challenges done just so I could get a skin! And whenever I go on twitter to see fortnite‚Äôs tweets and updates, I liked to look in comments for fake giveaways, and memes, but there were people Bragging that tHeIr So GoOd aT tHe gAmE and I just get annoyed seeing those tweets. I just sit there sad, thinking that I just want tryhards to go away! But, knowing the toxic community that‚Äôs never going to happen and if your sitting down trying to counter my story, then do it!

‚Ä¢ Adding an editing delay, since it takes literally no seconds to edit something on PC. It‚Äôs one click and they have the ability to edit stuff quicker with a mouse compared to a controller.

I was thinking it would split the map apart and then it comes back together but it looks like the OG map. Then the rocket from season 4 comes back and explodes and all the OG skins come back. (And the map turns back into normal because the rift also explodes) However in slight variants so you could tell you‚Äôre not an OG. (White suit John Wick, Blue Black Knight, Green Dark Voyager, maybe a Green Renegade Raider but these will be like Level 20, 40, 60, and 80 unlocks so you‚Äôll get the most skins this season along with completely new ones.) Farfetched? Yes. But I would really like to know what you think would happen.",FortNiteBR

The body damage for green and blue pumps is very inconsistent all of the sudden and it sucks. I want the 200 headshot damage for the blue pump back. I thought that was fair and balanced but it‚Äôs not there anymore. It‚Äôs very hard to get a one pump on a person with full shield and health with a green or blue pump, and not a whole lot easier with the purple and gold pump. What do you guys think is a fair amount of damage for the pump shotguns? Both body and headshot ",FortNiteBR

I understand if I play KB&amp;M and my buddies are on Xbox, they'll be placed into a lobby with other KB&amp;M players, but I am under the impression that there will be other Controller players there too?

If I was to play with controller on PC, with my buddies on Xbox, will I get KB&amp;M players? Or will it be only Controller (mixed between PC and console)?

484,rdplusm,1548937274,alox5u,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/alox5u/a_volcanic_eruption_is_coming_to_the_battle/,1,A volcanic eruption is coming to the Battle Royale Map as hinted in the season 7 Battle Pass Dark Bomber loading screen.,"In the Season 7 Battle Pass, Tier 78 is the Dark Bomber Unicorn loading page. The ""dark unicorn"" has the same chains on its ankle as those on the prisoner that has currently escaped from the Ice King's dungeon at Polar Peak. The chain in question also happens to be the previous Tier unlock.
In the background of the loading screen is an erupting volcano, as we know Epic love to tease upcoming events etc in the Battle Pass. 
I believe that this has a decent chance at happening because the Brite Bomber Unicorn had a rainbow over a foggy area, which we saw with the creation of Leaky Lake and the destruction of Kevin (RIP) at the special event last season.

Open to ideas, discussions and criticisms, just a thought I had when the loading screen popped up last night.
Apologies for the format, mobile user here.

For your next kills only getting 10 XP per kill is also much too little. What I propose is: when you get your first kill, you will get 100 XP and for your next kill 50 and with each kill you get it goes up by 10 XP. So if you would get four kills it would go like this: first kill=100 XP, second kill= 50 XP, third kill= 60 XP, fourth kill= 70. I think this is a better way to level up.

Full transparency, I did take a several month break when ‚Äúbuild battles‚Äù started to get a foot hold on players. I‚Äôve recently returned after several friends, who‚Äôve played even while I took my break, explained that building got a bit of a nerf and it‚Äôs not like it used to be in terms of just elitist players building above, around and all over everyone. 

On my return. I‚Äôm disappointed still. Epic, I thought you‚Äôd be different. I thought you would not be money hungry and I thought you would focus on the largest part of your player base not just the high end elitist players. Especially in the absence of a ranking system/ranked lobbies. 

Epic, you need to address somehow separating the sweaty awesome players and the casual players. There are times that I don‚Äôt feel worthy to be in the same lobby as people. There was a hour just last night where I felt I was just getting stomped over and over again by some dude I would never be able to beat. 

Also, in short. Building is still out of hand. I‚Äôm still on that band wagon that building should not be an end game skill and that being able to use your weapon effectively with the end all be all. No more spamming edits and switching weapons. ",FortNiteBR

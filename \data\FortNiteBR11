I used to play this 6+ hours a day in the first seasons, I don't know why but man, it just feels off to play now. It feels like coming back to WoW after leaving at Wotlk. Maybe the magic just isn't there anymore or I grew out of the game.

+From what I've seen Epic still manages to release shit performance patches as they still haven't got out of their habit to vomit content every week.

The Tactical Shotgun is horrible. Nobody favors the tac over the combat. A combat will beat a tac in basically any fight.

I guess this has something to do with the fact that school is over in some countries, but there may be other reasons.  
The point is that this also shows how unreliable Epic's indirect approach to skillgap reduction (introducing random items and wacky mechanics) is. 

And on top of that this also makes the game much less appealing for competitive play.

Sooner or later Epic should realize that a form of Skill Based Matchmaking tailored for pubs (my guess is an ELO ladder based only on kills and deaths will work well) is needed for the long term well being of the game, even if this means irritating uncompetitive high skill players.",FortNiteBR

I remember back in season 6 and 7 where the guns weren't like this and was fair to everyone. We had nice variety and finding a pump wasn't like Jesus coming up to you and telling you you're getting a V.I.P trip to heaven. The starting guns were appropiate enough to where you had a much better chance of survival wether you were a noob or pro because close range guns spawned more and there were more close range guns during that time. 

Now I'm happy if I don't find a gray heavy AR as my starting weapon. I die off spawn way more because of it. Finding a gray regular AR or blue tactical AR or anything that's good for close range feels like a luxury when it shouldn't be like that. That was standard before and now I'm lucky to have anything usable when someone downstairs has a green tac and it's really fucking discouraging. I don't see the point in trying to go for high kills when I die off spawn every time because I keep fucking getting unlucky. I don't like being forced to play passive in order to get far in the game because I'll get a bad weapon or no weapon starting out. It's not fun. It's fucking infuriating.  I don't even want to go near the game as much because of this now.

(clarification: only people who currently own the item should be allowed vote, otherwise every item would be voted to return, that would ruin the point)  what are your thoughts, leave them below üëá",FortNiteBR

At least as far as achievements in game goes. It would raise engagement on a massive amount of the casual player base and make reaching level 100 something ppl actively went after. We don‚Äôt have to remove the challenge/fortbyte etc skins as those are fun to grind for but I feel like this would be good for the game. I‚Äôm open to hearing how it could have a negative impact too though so feel free to fill me in. I‚Äôve been playing since season 5 and I‚Äôve yet to reach it myself but there‚Äôs also little incentive to do so and if there were I‚Äôm sure I could do it.

I think this for me would be my ideal base loot pool, as I understand that items are added and vaulted that fit that specific season's theme. I may have forgotten some things in there, but I'm pretty sure I've looked through the vault page and current weapon page for all my info. I'll edit other things in if I've forgotten anything!

&amp;#x200B;

Something I haven't really touched upon, either, is things added to the map that can provide transportation (rifts, vents, slipstreams etc.) as I think the vehicles were good enough for making your way across the map. I guess that's the OG player in me who remembers a time when you had to run everywhere. I look forward to hearing your thoughts, and reading your own contributions!",FortNiteBR

Nobody is gonna miss you if you uninstall ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø‚Ä¨ 

The game is meant to change each season and every other week with new additions and vaults, that‚Äôs what keeps the game fresh. If you find yourself hating a game so much that you have to rage online at some devs/community managers that might not have much say of what happens in the game, maybe it‚Äôs time to find something else to play. 

Just some food for thought.",FortNiteBR

It would be even better if you take the helmet off but that's asking for too much right now .. 

I would like to see some more of these near season 10 hopefully .. 

Like : 
Red , Royale and Black knight .. helmet off .. 
Also blue squire .. 

Dark voyager / vanguard 
Either colour selection or helmet off .. 


Now for skin concept .. people have been saying that the neo legends pack is a possibility but I doubt it .. 

People say the legend bundles usually come out on .20 updates with previous seasons but it wasn't leaked this update .. I hope they come out next update .. 

Anyway I want to show you guys a concept ..


( I think the name Neo legends doesn't sound too good .. I prefer this name ) 

Legacy Legends 

Legacy Vanguard 
""Exploring the possibilities""

( Dark Vanguard skin .. but she has a white suit and purple lights. Reactive suit .  Changes from white to gray back and forth .  Kind of like the maxed out lynx skin ) 

Legacy Void 
""Can't think of a good description"" 

( Same thing as legacy vanguard .. it's just a back blings ..it's white, gray and purple ) 


Legacy Shogun 
"" Predicting the Ultimate Showdown""

( Shogun , but it's white gray and red , has a metallic suit instead of the leather one he wears in the original ) 

Legacy wings 
( Bladed wings .. except it's white , gray and red ) 
""Wings with destiny""


Legacy lander 
( Deep space lander with red streaks and purple contrail . And it's metallic white and gray instead of black ) 
""Light - years ahead of the upcoming fate"" 

Legacy Streaks ( wrap ) 
Metallic white , and gray wrap with purple animated streaks 

""Can't think of description"" 

How would this pack sound ?? 
2 skins .. a glider and a wrap .. 

Also I have another pack .. 
We had the fallen love ranger and the inferno pack near the end of their respective seasons .. I think having a Neo pack would be cool for the end of season 9 ..

The skin wasn't my idea but the rest is ... 

Neon Knight skin pack ... 

Includes : 
Neon Knight ( male ) 
Neon shield 

1.2k worth of vbucks with challenges .. 
Neo slicer harvesting tool ... 

Would these two packs I created sell well . Please upvote so epic can see this ..share .. 

Please don't take credit .. however if you draw out these skins you can take major credit . Just mention it's my idea. . sorry to sound toxic ..",FortNiteBR

Release 9.2 is coming up, and we have, well, uh, a single audio update for you this time around. :)  Rest assured, we are working away on many new audio toys for you as outlined below.  Keep pinging the threads with audio feedback, we really do read and appreciate your comments.  Here‚Äôs the giant  overview of the improvements in release 9.2:

**Release 9.2 Audio fixes and updates:**

* Updated reload sounds for weapons to be mono instead of stereo.  This will help with spatialization improvements for weapon swap sounds.

**What we‚Äôre continuing to work on in the upcoming season:**

* Fix for PC audio device swap issues - audio should no longer drop when hot-swapping audio devices.  Should be in for release 9.3.
* Better hear the approach of enemy players outside player-built structures.  
   * How are folks liking the new enemy pickaxe impact on 1x1 sounds? (KNOCK KNOCK!)
* Improvements to issues of sounds dropping outside of player FOV.  
* Improvement of close versus distant player gliding sounds, to help clarify distance of gliding enemies.
* Improvement of incoming grenade and grenade bounce sound spatialization‚Ä¶ yep, it‚Äôs hard to get a fix on ‚Äòem and they‚Äôre deadly.
* Longer sounds properly playing during Replays. 
* Improved differentiation of teammate versus enemy audio.  In honor of your squadmate who keeps running in circles ‚Äònading for no reason.
* Internal testing of binaural/HRTF solution that will be a great help to headphone players, as well as other spatialization improvements.  This is a big and lengthy task, but initial tests of this are amazing sounding.

As a reminder, shoot us your issues in the below format:

* replay URL
* time code of issue
* display name of player followed via gameplay view
* description of issue

 Next season‚Äôs like 48 days away or some shit. By that point I think they will...
 1. Bring back the pump. I really hope this happens, and will be mortified if they don‚Äôt.
 2. Vault the Tac. Not a bad gun, but can give you shitty results if you‚Äôre unlucky.
 3. Keep the combat shotgun and buff the damage a slight bit. In the end, you‚Äôll have the pump, which does a lot of damage up close but can‚Äôt shoot far. And then on the other end of the spectrum, the combat shotgun which shoots super far but doesn‚Äôt do as much damage.

(For people who have experience with PCs),"So ever since 9.10 I‚Äôve been experiencing large issues with Fortnite and FPS drops, before I was getting a 100 FPS average and now it‚Äôs around the 40s and 30s at its lowest,
I‚Äôd be fine with this if my pc was $400 or a little higher
But the thing is my pc had a gtx 1060 graphics card, i5 7400, and 8 gigs of ram.
So either my cpu isn‚Äôt letting my gpu work as hard as it should or it‚Äôs a ram problem because I stutter a bit.
If it‚Äôs a PC issue with the parts could you please tell me and either recommend a decent budget cpu that works well ideally for multitasking such as discord and having multiple tabs open, or if it‚Äôs a ram issue.",FortNiteBR

Even if it was a portion of the sales. Seems like a no brainier and they haven't done it in over a year of insane skin sales. Other games have done it with insane success and would be nothing compared to if Epic did it. Sorry if this is ranty but I just wish they would try it.

In seasons 6, 7, 8 I was doing great and easily keeping up with the competition. It seems that right as season 9 came in, I was garbage. I would try to use the combat shotguns to get better at them and I will adapt at every turn, even if I don't like it. But this game is now unbelievably hard in solos and duos (squads is pretty easy). I find myself getting no good loot (Only heavy aks and no shotguns) and I can barely last in the game as when I push one person, I get 4 other people trying to kill only me while I'm at 3 hp from the other guy I fought.

This is extremely annoying as we are at an inherent disadvantage vs most squads we fight. Whenever trios is in the game it is very enjoyable as we have a much higher chance of winning squad fights and the game. As far as I know the only difference between squads and trios is the number of the people in each team so I don't know why trios is an LTM. Has epic ever commicated why trios is an LTM? Also it seems so rare and it only lasts a day so it's very frustrating if we miss it. Is there no space for trios or would it cause matchmaking to become worse?

People tell me ‚Äústop complaining and play arena‚Äù. Arena sucks when you are on an original Xbox playing against people with mouse, keyboard and computers that are 100x more powerful than my Xbox. My Xbox lags in the endgame of arena matches. It is simply unfair.

I don‚Äôt care if they don‚Äôt want to put siphon and faster farming in the normal game modes (where I can actually play against other console/controller players). Could epic at least consider making a separate arena playlist specifically for console?

None of my friends play this game anymore and I‚Äôm barely playing myself. I used to play this game daily ever since season 1. I really love Fortnite but I just can‚Äôt enjoy it anymore.

And before people start saying ‚Äúthe farming is the same as it was in the past!‚Äù its not. Epic has quietly nerfed different structures that used to give more material. 

Players are also better at the game now. More people are using more material, and it‚Äôs harder to come by now. I‚Äôm bored of hitting trees. I want to play the game.",FortNiteBR

1. Infantry Rifle (Uncommon and Rare)

This item is good and all, but I don't see people really picking it up. I have no problem with it, but I feel like its not that used. The Legendary and Epic variants are the only ones I see being used, more than the less rare ones (which confuses me), so with that said, I think it should be vaulted just based on how much its used.

2. Drum Gun

This one is pretty obvious. This item is Over Powered, by just spraying and holding w, you can get into peoples builds with ease. Its damage is also a problem, it just deals to much. Buffing its rarity is a possibility, but even then it would still be OP. So even though I voted for it, I say Vault It.

3. (Final) Heavy AR

This ones controversial, but I say that Epic should vault the Heavy AR. Its a good gun, but like the Infantry, not many peoplr use it anymore. Hell, I even forgot it was in the game! This AR doesn't fit with the rest, as most players perfer silent and fast firing assault rifles, which the AK is non of those. So, trash it.

This is all my Opinion, so give yours in the comments, what would you like vaulted, or disagree with?",FortNiteBR

Or can the challenge be changed to reach season level 70/75/80 in any season? It is just as fair since we all bought the battle pass and grinded to tier 100. And those who bought thiers had an advantage of a higher xp boost. It is not like bringing back the omega skin. So it is still only for people who have the omega skin. And 99% of the players with omega have carbides lights unlocked and it gives people the reason to use the omega again Or can it at least be unlocked for those on switch since the season started later on there. Or can the style be granted to those who reached level 80 in any season? Since i have reached level 84 in season 5 because of the 400% xp weekend. And i have already left this feedback in the feedback section in the game because this is really something i want to see back because i don‚Äôt use the omega skin because i was level 74 in season 4. Or give them to people who buy the oblivion skin, so that you need to pay 2k vbucks. So that it is fair. And still takes a grind.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**ASSAULT RIFLES AND MACHINE GUNS**

Assault Rifle - Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary

Burst Assault Rifle - Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary

Light Machine Gun - Rare, Epic

Tactical Assault Rifle - Rare, Epic, Legendary

Suppressed SMG - Common, Uncommon, Rare

Drum Gun - Rare, Epic

**PISTOLS**

Revolver - Common, Uncommon, Rare

Hand Cannon - Epic, Legendary

Suppressed Pistol - Epic, Legendary

**SHOTGUNS**

Tactical Shotgun - Rare, Epic, Legendary

Combat Shotgun - Rare, Epic, Legendary

Heavy Shotgun - Common, Uncommon, Rare

**SNIPER RIFLES**

Suppressed Sniper Rifle - Rare, Epic, Legendary

Heavy Sniper Rifle - Epic, Legendary

Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle - Common, Uncommon

**EXPLOSIVE WEAPONS**

Rocket Launcher - Rare, Epic, Legendary

Grenade Launcher - Rare, Epic, Legendary

Quad Launcher - Epic, Legendary

Boom Bow - Legendary

**MISCELLANEOUS**

Minigun - Epic, Legendary

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**NOTABLE VAULTS:**

Burst SMG - Completely Useless, outclassed by nearly every weapon in the game

Infantry Rifle - No strong case to keep in in game besides its  e p i c  reload noise

Heavy Assault Rifle - Made useless with nerfs. Better off in the vault with another weapon taking its place

Pistol - Unused except in early game engagements

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**NOTABLE UNVAULTS:**

Revolver - Can function as a lower-tier handcannon. Useful for dealing large damage but with a slow fire rate.

Suppressed SMG - Did not deserve to be vaulted. Actually used during games.

Burst AR - Underutilized weapon. Would make a good replacement of the Heavy AR.

LMG - Wild-card weapon. Needed a replacement for the infantry rifle and will likely shake up the meta a bit.

Heavy Shotgun - Already coming back based on the Season 9 loading screen alone

&amp;amp;#x200B;

**NOTABLE CHANGES:**

Drum Gun rarity increased to Rare and Epic from Uncommon and Rare - The Drum Gun is definitely a higher-tier weapon, and only being uncommon and rare does not reflect its strength.

Tactical Shotgun rarity increased to Rare, Epic, and Legendary from Common, Uncommon, and Rare - The Tactical Shotgun should rival the Combat Shotgun, and a higher rarity (and better stats) reflects that rivalry.

Heavy Shotgun rarity decreased to Common, Uncommon, and Rare from Epic and Legendary - In season 9's current meta, the heavy shotgun would definitely be the lower-tier shotgun. In a long-gone era of shotgun mediocrity, the heavy shotgun was a god, but unless it is adjusted it would be a shadow of its former self.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

This combination of weapons would likely create a different meta, one completely new. A vast array of playstyles would flourish in the wake of a weapon pool such as this, with the burst rifle and tactical rifle likely becoming the most used assault rifles. The LMG would create a reawakening of the ""spray meta"" but a buffed tactical shotgun and a returning heavy shotgun would strengthen the ""shotgun meta"". Obviously this exact weapon pool will never happen, but speculation is fun, and this would be an interesting weapon pool to see in-game.\*

**Overview**: Players are placed in an arena-style sudden death tournament and must advance through opponents using only their melee weapon (pickaxe) and strategy. The winner is crowned king of the pack, having survived all of his opponents and winning the Combat Cup (shiny trophy).

**Rules**: 

\- Team size: solo 

\- 28 players per match 

\- Player Stats: Begin with 200 HP and shield, with each elimination granting 55 HP immediately 

\- Limitations: 

\- No building

\- No inventory items, only your pickaxe 

\- Enhancements: 

\- +20% player speed, 

\- +15% jump height and jump speed

\- Double jump enabled (similar to shadow bomb but just one double jump, not repetitive)

\- Jump fatigue removed

\- Pickaxe does 50 damage per hit and 85 damage with a ""charge hit"". Charge hit requires player to stand still for 1.5  
seconds while charging the pickaxe; the ""charge"" disappears after 3.5 seconds (this balances the damage   
output by giving the opponent an opportunity to attack during charge and/or try to evade the player until his charge   
runs out) 

Eliminations: 

\- There are only two ways to die: melee death or fall damage. 

\- The only way a player can die from fall damage is if he falls through the floor of the combat room. This can only be   
done if one of the combatants destroys the floor tile. Floor tiles are the only tiles that can be destroyed (walls and   
ceilings are indestructible); floor tiles take two hits to destroy. (This mechanic is good for expanding player strategy   
options, increasing the skill gap, and its also just an awesome scene in the Tron movie.)

**Map &amp; Gameplay**: 

\- The arena is a massive, floating structure with 16 ""combat rooms"". When the match begins, 2 players will be spawned into each combat room (this will be your first opponent). The match begins after a 3 second countdown. 

Combat Rooms: 

\- Each combat room will be an open, straight surface that allows for free player movement (see images). Each combat room will have 4-6 bouncers randomly spawned on tiles in the room (ceilings and walls especially). This will increase the skill gap as players begin to learn how to out-maneuver their opponents using the environment and their enhanced movement  

![img](div6nkggak231 ""All rights and ownership to this image remain with Disney Enterprises, Inc.  "")

\- Each combat room is connected to another combat room by a sealed gate, but the gate remains sealed until you have defeated your opponent. Once you have defeated your opponent, you may proceed to the gate. If the 2 players in the next combat room have not finished their fight, the gate will not open, but you'll be able to watch the fight and emote while you wait (the gate will be the same texture as the storm but much lighter for visibility). 

(Side note: Winners shouldn't have to wait for the next fight but if the game let winners go to the next room immediately while the other combatants are still fighting, the game would become a third-party/teaming game and people would get frustrated)  

&amp;#x200B;

**Final Stage**: Once the last 2 players have finished their fights, they will meet at the Final Stage. As a reward for making it this far, both players will be given 100 HP upon crossing the gate to enter the Final Stage. The Final Stage is a larger combat room with a vibrant theme, additional bouncer tiles, and higher ceilings. The room should be fitting for the final showdown between two top competitors. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Random Points/Ideas**:

\- Spectators will not be kicked (this would be one of the more fun game modes to spectate)

\- Figured I'd exclude this from main description since I don't know much about creative but, if its possible, it may be a good idea to have the walls push in very, very slowly during the match to make sure one person does not try to evade their opponent all game. The walls would reset after the gate is activated and the next opponent enters. Storm damage would disturb the mechanics of the game and limit player movement so I don't think that's a good alternative. 

\- Again, I'm clueless in creative but it would be cool if the Combat Cup was floating above the Final Stage room

\- Top 4 players should receive XP bonuses 

\- Please give any suggestions, criticisms, or things I didn't think of!",FortNiteBR

Tbh, most of the pickaxes look atrocious by design as far as i examined.  Vox is pretty slick in that matter and only a few more are looking sweet like that such as Icicle, spectral axe, virtue, moonrise i guess.

It felt like when I first started playing FN. I couldn't help but get emotionally invested. Screaming when I won and laughing along the way. I would think about it while at work and go straight home to play after. I check everyday hoping it's back. I go into creative to practice my flying and keep my skills up. On one hand I would like to see it be permanent like rumble is now, but on the other hand I would probably never leave the house again if that were the case. I didn't see much excitement about it in the sub but hopefully there are some lurkers that feel the same way and hopefully they are sorting by new today.",FortNiteBR

Uh huh, uh huh  
Yeah, Rihanna  
Uh huh, uh huh   
Good girl gone bad  
Uh huh, uh huh   
Take three, action  
Uh huh, uh huh, ho  
No clouds in my stones  
Let it rain, I hydroplane into fame  
Comin' down at the Dow Jones  
When the clouds come, we gone  
We Rocafella  
We fly higher than weather  
In G5's or better  
You know me  
In anticipation for precipitation stack chips for the rainy day  
Rain man is back with little Ms. Sunshine  
Rihanna, where you at?  
You have my heart, and we'll never be worlds apart  
Maybe in magazines, but you'll still be my star  
Baby, 'cause in the dark  
You can't see shiny cars  
And that's when you need me there  
With you I'll always share  
Because

When the sun shines, we shine together  
Told you I'll be here forever  
Said I'll always be your friend  
Took an oath that I'm a stick it out 'til the end  
Now that it's raining more than ever  
Know that we still have each other  
You can stand under my umbrella  
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh  
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh  
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh  
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh  
These fancy things will never come in between  
You're part of my entity, here for infinity  
When the world has took its part  
When the world has dealt its cards  
If the hand is hard, together we'll mend your heart  
Because  
You can run into my arms  
It's okay, don't be alarmed  
(Come into me)  
(There's no distance in between our love)  
So I'm gonna let the rain pour  
I'll be all you need and more  
Because  
It's raining, raining  
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining  
Baby, come into me  
Come into me  
It's raining, raining  
Ooh, baby, it's raining, raining  
You can always come into me  
Come into me  
It's pouring rain  
It's pouring rain  
Come into me  
Come into me  
It's pouring rain  
It's pouring rain ...

It should just eject you and not let you deploy the glider.,"I love the biplane. Dogfights are some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in Fortnite. But I share everyone else‚Äôs frustrations that there‚Äôs basically no risk involved because there‚Äôs no penalty to getting shot down, and shooting someone down just results in them safely floating away. I think removing the ability to deploy the glider if the plane explodes can solve this problem.  
Getting shot down at high altitudes would be a death sentence. This gives players an interesting dilemma in a fight. Do I stay in this plane and try to turn this around but risk getting shot down? Or do I bail early and try to escape? Do I decend to try to keep the fight going at a safer altitude where I have a chance of surviving the fall?  
It would also add more tactical options to engaging another player. Try to fly low and stay safe or draw the enemy to a higher altitude for a more guaranteed kill? Do I engage from a distance and take them by surprise? Or get up close for a faster kill that lessens the chance they‚Äôll bail out? I think this could be an interesting mechanic.

I think new item addition is going crazy.

They do not even take the time to balance a new item before adding a new one.  
 

Every updates add new bugs that really make the game feel worse than his previous state.  
 

I think they should stop adding new stuff for a week or two and release a huge update to fix bugs and optimize the game on all platforms.

Season 7 has so much potential and they will ruin everything if they do not focus on major bug fixes and slow down on adding new stuff.

It is amazing, but it simply is just too powerful and extremely hard to counter due to the fact that you have a total of 400 health and 130% increased movement speed. You also regain 50 HP upon each kill. Plus you can build with it.

I think that there should be a nerf to the movement speed. Its giant and should slow you down. I think it should lower your speed by 10% at the least. The health pool for this weapon should be nerfed too. I think that it would be fair if it only granted a total of 300 health. (150 health and shields)

It s a cool addition, but it just doesnt really fit as a weapon in the main game. This would make it more balanced. Or if epic made this just an LTM and it was similar to the infinity gauntlet, I think it would be better. It could just fall from the sky just like the gauntlet.

No turrets, dynamite, six shooters, items that give you high ground with no effort or skill and explosives that took down an entire base or structure in one hit. The game was just about those that could aim and build and those that couldn‚Äôt. Now I understand everyone has become better at the game over time and most people have gotten the hang of building but is there really much use in building anymore. If you build someone with an rpg will just destroy your entire structure, or throw dynamite, use a plane to crash through everything with little to no consequences (yes I know planes are being adjusted so that you take damage if it gets destroyed soon), use a rift or grapple gun to take high ground with one push of a button. Some people are starting the game with a full shield, a shotgun and an AR while others are stuck to suffer with a six shooter, dynamite and balloons (also I like balloons but it‚Äôs just an example).

Second, can we PLEASE STOP with the explosive weapon and items?  Literally 5 games in a row I Killed everyone via a gun battle, but every single time I wound up dying was due simply to explosive weapons.  Albeit a grenade launcher, rocket launcher, dynamite, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that people will use them since they are ever so abundant in nature and readily available to use.  However, it's gotten to a point where everyone knows the ideal stuff to have rather than using a composition of items and weapons that is actually fit to THEM.  No, we ALL need shotguns, no we ALL need to have some type of explosive weapon/items.  Minis/Medkit possible.  Good to go.  It's just ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, again, it brings up the factor that most of these players are 10x the player I am.  I don't have the physical time to sit at home playing this game continuously for hours on end.  Which brings me to Skill Based Matchmaking.  I don't care if it's a battle royale or not.  I don't care if it's COD or CS or PUBG or FN.  Every game should be tailored to having a progression system.  Not a RANKING progression system, just a system that is implemented to allow players to progress skill wise at their own pace.  A system like this would be phenomenal for this type of game.  No, instead we get thrown randomly into a lobby where 95 out of the 100 are like insanely good players.  That's just a little unfair for a casual player.  Which is what baffles me about this game being so popular because it LITERALLY HAS NO GROWTH progression in it period.  

&amp;#x200B;

Play More, they said.

Git Gud, they said.

Shut up, they said.

Keep trying, they said.

&amp;#x200B;

None of that matters when you land in a zone (whether initial starting bus location, or ending location) you'll find every type of player.  Now, if I'm in a lobby with players around my own skill, the satisfaction of winning that would be much higher due to the fact I played against those who of equal or near equal skill as I am.  

&amp;#x200B;

Winning a battle royale where a potato got lucky and killed a god tier player and then sat still in a bush so I can snipe him for the win is absolutely absurd and ridiculous.  

&amp;#x200B;

For once, can the Epic Game Developers listen to the casual gamer?  We get it, top notch streams make a crap ton of money for you, but, we've seen the hype around the skirmishes when top tier players get paired against other top tier players.  The wins and victories are much more prestigious than a stream doing a youtube video on insane shots versus bots.  Come on.  

&amp;#x200B;

Starting to wonder if ""We are listening to the community"" even applies to ANY game development money.  I'll rephrase it for you:

&amp;#x200B;

""We are listening to the community (The ones that will make us more money)""

&amp;#x200B;

You're welcome.

What the fuck?

So I played 2 hours just now. Just chillin, you know, hoping to score that epic victory royale. I'm making my way towards paradise, when I see a player and, well you know me, I'm all attacc attacc, so naturally I immediately go on the offensive on my fellow gamer of the remaining 15 or so. 

Now, we had a good battle, he was a good player. I had hard time killing him, which is a good thing, because who doesn't love a good fight. 

I hear a plane incoming to our direction, the fight was still going on, I had the high-ground and everything was good. I wasnt a stranger to 3rd partying, so I didnt think nothing of the plane, I thought the nice fellow was gonna join us in the fight.

But no, well yes he did, but not in the way I imagined. You see, he didnt jump out of the plane. He kept firing with the planes turret at me and tried to run me over, and he did. I flew about 30 meters or so away, and so did my enemy, who had tried to regain high ground.

I lost 30 or something when I flew, and about 60hp from the plane turret, so 90 in total. 

I quickly built up, but my enemy turtled up down on the ground. He was probably healing as well. 

I was kinda angry, but I thought I could survive since I had some minis. Well I take one, and another. Then the plane comes through again. He fires again the turret, and flies under me. He didnt hit me with the plane, but did once with the turret. 

Now I was very low on Hp. I try to get some minis in. I couldnt make it, and he flies me over once more, killing me.

I had no time to shoot the damn plane, it all happened so fast, and the plane didnt look damaged so I figured I couldnt do it, since he would shoot me before it breaks, so I just kept dodging it.

Anyway, I spectate the man, whom I am furious at. He runs the other guy over as well, doing some damage. Immediately jumps outta the plane and kills him as he is low.

This exact same thing happened to me 4 times in total, in different locations, in the span of 2 hours. And those are only the times I didnt survive.

The pilot has no danger of whatsoever when he is on that plane. It is impossible to hit them, the plane health is way too high, and no damage when broken and exploded. Also, the going through buildings, ridiculous. Planes grant absolutely incredible rotations and lets you parachute off whenever you please. You can fly it to a mountain, and nothing happens to you, absolutely nothing. Youre fine. Also, building doesnt help, he just goes through them. 

They need to be nerfed.

Here's my idea:

Nerf the damage, atleast on players.

Damage will be taken, when plane explodes.

Remove the ability to go through walls. 

Don't let players skydive when leaving the plane. Immediate glider-opening needed.

Epic, I believe you don't test your items before releasing, because every new item is fucking overpowered, this one too. And that is absurd. You are a million dollar company, get your shit together.


TL;DR:  4 times in 2 hours got killed by a person on a plane, never leaving, just shooting and running me over. Building does not help to counter. Needs immediate nerf.

Penny here with an update of the story of both Fortnite Modes. 

For people who say both modes are not linked, please read until the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Introduction :

If you didn't know it, which I suppose, EPIC has finally released full storyline of Canny Valley, the Third zone of Save the World gamemode. 

The final boss of this line is known as the Storm King, 

[The Storm King](https://i.redd.it/ze7dmpdpoh321.png)

(For more information about the storm king, you can check [EPIC's post in r/fortnite](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/a4xhq4/the_storm_king_arrives/))

&amp;#x200B;

But if we go back to our subject :

&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer : I haven't personally experienced it, I am still in the grind, so I will use what has been provided in r/FORTnITE.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore,  when you defeat the Storm King, he dissolves in his mud pool and transforms ...

And now it arrives ....

&amp;#x200B;

When he dissolves, becomes a strange shape and floats around :

&amp;#x200B;

[Credits to : u\/charliethecadet for the pic :\)](https://i.redd.it/kdhwn6hyph321.png)

Wait, didn't I already see thsi somewhere ? 

Is it ? The CUBE ? KEVIN ?

&amp;#x200B;

[Kevin the Cube in Battle Royale](https://i.redd.it/v7e8wmv7qh321.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

# Explanations :

From now on, this is entirely theoretical, I have no arguments to backup as there hasn't been any official proof. 

Now that I have got your attention, I can start . 

There is therefore a true link between the both modes of Fortnite. 

Furthermore, If wee look in the past, there has been some hints of it.

&amp;#x200B;

* The season 5 Title . Worlds collide : 

What are the 2 worlds that exist ? Probably the StW realm and the Battle Royale islands. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Storm Monters

What is called ""The storm"" is a mysterious thing that came without warning and decimated 98% of the population. This lead to the creation of Vinder Technology by Dr. Vinderman, V-Bucks stands for Vinder Bucks FYI, leading to the survival of heroes and the creation of Fortnite

&amp;#x200B;

And come on, Husks in STW and Storm Monsters in BR are \*pretty\* similar

&amp;#x200B;

Alongside, we know that EPIC has a tendency to slightly not respect their deadlines.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion : 

""still theoretical""

We can therefore conclude that :

The arrival of Kevin the Cube in BR and the Fortnitemares following it was actually supposed to launch the F2P of Fortnite Save the World. The Storm King dissolves, becomes Kevin and rolls around the BR map. Battle Royale only players can therefore retrace the origins of Kevin by doing the Save the World story. 

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that The Storm King arrives a little after Kevin is that the STW development team got slightly reduced with the Success of BR, so they haven't been able to fulfill their promises. The delay of F2P is another point. It was supposed to come out in 2018, guess what was in 2018 ? The worlds that collide. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Post-scriptum :

(That's what P.S means)

In the Save The world storylines, we notice that some characters have a skin that has been released in BR. Maverick is known as Anthony, Bandolier as Carlos. Lianne (My sister) is Power Chord in BR. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additional information : You remember when Power Chord first came out ? That was a long time ago. IMO, it was then they added her to the storyline, and didn't want to re-release it until the Canny Storyline came out. But by popular demand ...

There seems to be no real counter play against planes other than, waste an entire few clips to take them down. Unless you manage to pull off a reddit-worthy snipe to hit the driver... But as it stands, inside a plane, you are free to fly around, know you won't take much/any damage, and when it gets destroyed, you can fly away freely.  

As a suggestion, i think planes should either do damage when they explode to the player,  not be able to ram through things as freely as they do, or have limited fuel to reduce the time you can spend in air.  The first suggestion i think is the greatest as it gives people on the ground a chance to kill the pilot.  Pilots can't afford to be greedy in a damaged plane on the off-chance it explodes either.

They are literally flying turrets/launchpads that have 800 health. You can destroy anything with your 100% accurate machine gun (with a slight projectile mechanic), you can crush people or send them flying to their death by crashing into them or you can simply use the planes as the fastest method to traverse the map (one of the fastest at least). I think the planes need 1 of 2 things. My first idea is that they should act like planes in every other game and explode when they make contact with a structure. This will make people be less agressive while flying around. Also if your plane is shot down, you should either die or be severely hurt. My second idea is that the turret should be removed. If this happens, you will have to get dangerously close in order to attack and it can be more of a movement option than a combat option. Either way, there needs to be a more reliable way to shoot them down. I suggest that there should be a lock-on mechanic with the RPGs or quad launchers. In conclusion, I believe the planes are completely overpowered especially for how common they are, and they need to change as they are ruining the balance and meta of the game.",FortNiteBR

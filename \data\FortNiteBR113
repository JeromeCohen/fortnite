&amp;#x200B;

1st I think Fortnite has been targeted because it's making a hell of a lot of money and is the most popular and therefore has gotten the originators / performers attention who see Fornite making millions and want some of it. Which is valid as long as there are laws there to back up your claim, But currently there are none. Epic are breaking no laws by including or  profiting from these emotes.

&amp;#x200B;

A morality argument can be made for profiting off the originators / performers creations but so could the popularity of these emotes pre Fortnite and would they be as popular today without Fortnite while also not hurting the originators / performers by keeping them relevant, showcasing their creation to a newer generation who never heard of Carlton or The Fresh prince of Bel Air or Turk and Scrubs or the actors who played them. Not to mention extra work or interviews they have profited from as a result of the resurgence of these emotes in Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

Arguments can be made on both sides but in the end these lawsuits have no law to back them up, If a law is introduced or created to offer protection for the originators / performers all Epic has to do is remove the emotes that break said law before it is put into law and carry on. The originators / performers will get ownership of their creation but Epic won't have to pay them a dime while the originators / performers will still have to pay their own legal fees.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR : Epic will just remove the emotes as they are presently breaking no law and you can't be sued for something that isn't unlawful yet",FortNiteBR

So first of all i've been playing the game since late season 2. I thought Fortnite was a really good game, i've played FPS games before but the whole building thing was seemed really fun so i started playing Fortnite quite a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I usually play with my friends and try to have some fun, that worked until like season 5 or 6. You know when the skirmish and tournaments began and everyone naturally wanten to get better at the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

We stood no chance, like we always had the best loot and but you know we are not that good at the game (bots), so after looting and farming we come across one good player (tryhard) who just abuses us in every possible way.

&amp;#x200B;

And you know that changed when the wholen pop-up cups started. But still not that much better.. and the that there are no pop-ups anymore it's like impassible to compete with some of the great players in our game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Especially because me and my friends attend to play at night after work school and other stuff. and as you may know that's also the time where streamers, ttv's, twitchers, youtubers, commandos and soccer skins attend to play as well. So around that time we are usually a youtube/ twitch clip material for these guys.

&amp;#x200B;

What i'm trying to say is, it's really unfair that is no ranked system in Fortnite. Really unfair for both sides, i want to play and relax with my friends and other people want to grind and get better at the game and playing in the same server is just really boring/frustrating for both sides.

&amp;#x200B;

Pop-ups are a great way to attract better players so at least make pop-ups more often. 

It might seem really silly for some people that i'm complaining about these kind of issue but to me and my friends Fortnite is a way to relax and kind hang out with each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also you can see it this way, would it be fair for a professional NBA players to compete against some local high school basketball team. Not only that but also calling those kids bad at the game and being toxic towards them.

&amp;#x200B;

So Epic please make pop-ups available all the time with some kind of in-game rewards, so good players compete in there while we bots have our nice little colorful server. Most ideally you guys should imp lay some kind of a ranked system but that might be hard idk. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**: I'm a bot who is sick of all the pro players wrecing me and my friends in pubs and want this to end. Please Epic make some kind of pop-ups available all the time for those players with some in-game reward or something. And maybe a ranked system ?? thanks 

Anyway i hope my you guys got my point, sorry for my bad English.

Many players may rejoice but some may think it‚Äôs a bad idea. Back in the day when many of the player base couldn‚Äôt build double pump ruled however now many know how at least react when they get shot. With the meta being shotgun and smg I think double pump may bring back some skill. I think some may change their thoughts on the double pump as they may see how underwhelming it is without a smg after the first shot they can‚Äôt just continue as the opponent is most likely going to build. it also might remove the ghost shot bug where when you have your shotgun out and you try to edit on a higher ping than usual it shoots a ghost shot and you can‚Äôt shoot again. I know they tried to fix that in the recent update. Iam sorry if this was not very easy to understand as turning thought into words is difficult, anyway what iam trying to say is double shotgun may or may not work in the current meta

TL;DR- Bring back double pump as it may not be as strong as it used to be and it could fix ghost shots",FortNiteBR

\- Boom boxes

\- Dynamite

\- Quad Launcher

\- Don't make the RPG spawn goddam everywhere ( i think this happened on season 6 )

\- vault the Current SMG, bring back tac SMG &amp; adjust the P90 to be different

\- Remove these new gliders

\- make at least one shield (3 minis in one stack or 1 shield pot \[50\] ) guarnteed spawn on every house that has chests and that i think this is possible. bUt rNg iS Part Of The Game MaTe wHAT r yoU tAKING abouT?... yes it is but not like this...i'm that kind of guy who kills like 7 people and none of them has shield in their pocket they just drank it all... minis doesn't seem to be spawning like it used to 50 shields seems to be spawning more despite it's rarity being higher ...

\- Vault turrets ( people throws it whenever they get it and they litreally spawn everywhere even after the patch i get like 3 turrets every game and there has to be one default in every game uses them to spray the f out of you while building around him and only leaving the spot where he shoots you exposed. even after the adjustments that they did with you being able to shoot them easily while they're riding the turrets i still have a hard time landing a hit on them without a sniper)

\- Make it that you're unable to redeploy when jumping off a plane, This allows easy third parties. make plains unable to shoot.. it doesn't even make sense anyway 'BuT nOthing IN This GaMe mAkEs Sense stEELdASH!"". and why the hell are you able to destroy structures with a plane...last time i saw a plane crushing something everyone in it died.

\- Make heavy shotgun acts like the new pump rework. the heavy shotgun feels like the pump before this recent rework that came out late season 6. it hits for 17 sometimes (when i say sometimes i mean most of the time) and when i land a clean headshot it ends up being 119 (i know 197 is the max damage but that has to be close range and that's not how the heavy shotgun was intended to be) .. while the blue pump body is 95-100-105-110. and it's guarnteed even when u miss one pellet... u just have to hit two pellets or three for the maximum damage \[headshot\]. Here is what i suggest you do. Make the heavy shotty damage 90 from it's mid-long range. max headshot damage : 200 \[2.5x head\]. boom, now it's perfect. Plus.. didn't they remove revolver cuz nobody picks it up over other weapons? isn't heavy shotty the same thing these days? nobody picks it up over a green pump...don't vault it please just adjust it. also can't wait for a suprresed shotgun

\- And if you're saying most of these things counters turtle... guess what? there is ton of unpopular methods to counter turtle... thanks to the ""The Gamer Couple"" on youtube they exposed these methods :

\- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de\_EQT-A\_FQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de_EQT-A_FQ)

I‚Äôm in college and picked it up midway through season 6 but the whole style is amazing, I was sick of realistic shooters like battlefield and CoD and Fortnite seemingly captured everything that i wanted in a new shooter, dlc wise, gameplay wise and graphic wise. The idea of building fascinated me. I watch a guy named Tfue and he‚Äôs fucking amazing at the game, however I play Xbox.

I used to be good at other shooters but for the life of me cannot seem to get better at fortnite. I average 1-3 kills in solos, and panic a lot in duos and especially squads.

Never won a solos, got carried to wins in squads and especially duos.

What do you guys to do get better? Lately I‚Äôve been trying team rumble but people don‚Äôt play as freely as they would in other game modes.",FortNiteBR

341,QuintonPotato,1547864902,ahhwnv,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ahhwnv/inconsistent_ping_issue/,1,Inconsistent Ping Issue," I have a problem with inconsistent ping and its been happening since  around the start of season 7. Its actually consistently inconsistent.  One game I will have my normal ping which is around 30-40 and around 80% of the time the next game I will have 120-200+ ping. Most times that I'm playing I'm actually praying that the next game isn't one of those  games.. This happens multiple times during a session of playing. I've contacted my internet provider and had them check and see if it was on their end and they told me nothing was wrong on their end. Ive ran speedtests when I've been in one of those high ping games and everything is normal on my end. My internet provider says it may be something to do with my connection to the epic games servers. I'm on PC running a wired connection and my brother is on XBOX in the other room on a wireless connection and has the exact same problem.  
 

I want to add that sometimes the 120-200+ping stays for MULTIPLE games and even hours and I find myself leaving OVER and OVER AGAIN until I get into a game with normal ping. Its so frustrating especially since I can't even play the game the same every game because I have to take into account my TERRIBLE ping. It's even more frustrating when there is a pop up cup live like today and there is a game limit and I have to keep leaving and rejoining game to try and get decent ping.  
 

I can confirm that this is a fortnite only problem as I have tested to see if this happens with other games.  


I have already posted this to Epic Forums and still have yet to get an answer.  

I would really love to find a solution to this so please, if you need any more information from me please do not hesitate to ask for more. Thank you.

Hi everyone,

To celebrate reaching 1 million subscribers (we‚Äôre so close!), we wanted to do something meaningful and impactful. We have decided on a /r/FortniteBR fundraiser. Let‚Äôs donate money for a good cause!

**Leave a comment in this thread to nominate a charity for our sub to support.** We'll use [CrowdRise](https://www.crowdrise.com/) to support whichever charity the community picks in a week-long drive beginning with our event next weekend (January 26th-27th). More on that event below.

To vote on other people‚Äôs nominations, just upvote their comment!

Details on how to nominate:

‚Ä¢ Top-level comments in this thread should be charity nominations. To be approved, your comment should contain a serious, CrowdRise-able charity suggestion with an explanation of what the charity is and the impact it has. [Here is an example of a great nomination comment!](https://old.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/comments/8aa251/four_months_ago_we_raised_10000_for_a_wildlife/dwx16ea/)

‚Ä¢ Ideally, your nominee would be Fortnite-related: maybe that means a llama charity or a homeless charity to help build homes, or a gaming or web-related group. It's up to you as long as it doesn't break sub rules.

‚Ä¢ It's a good idea to check [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) before nominating a charity, to make sure you're proposing a group that uses its donations well.

We'll vote in this thread through January 25th, with an announcement about the charity we have picked to support on January 26th.

## Mods vs. Community Games

Using community-created maps from our sister sub /r/FortniteCreative, we will pit the /r/FortniteBR subscribers against the moderators for the weekend of January 26th in Creative Mode. More details to come later in the week once we surpass the 1 million subscribers mark, but it would be wise for anyone interested in playing to join the [subreddit Discord](https://discord.gg/FortniteBR) if you haven‚Äôt already, and to start practicing on the Creative maps found in [this thread!](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortniteCreative/comments/aa613m/extensive_list_of_island_codes_by_category/)

##Prizes

I love Fortnite since November of 2017, I discovered the game with controller, but I quickly wanted to reach the level of my KB/M friends, so I bought a mouse (first game I've ever played with a mouse), but has no choice to keep the controller in my left hand (playing the same role as a keyboard, like this guy : [https://youtu.be/tsw3EuCfby0?t=20](https://youtu.be/tsw3EuCfby0?t=20) )

And hey ! I can compete with KB/M players like this ! In fact, no one who play with me can see I'm not a keyboard player, I can aim, I can build fast, and even switch fast. I've played 6000+ games like this, but since the last update, my game looks like THIS : [https://streamable.com/v9yx7](https://streamable.com/v9yx7)

I can play with a controller like I said, but for FIFA or other games, I've  hardly ever played Fortnite with controller (and I don't even like shooters like COD, just Fortnite). That's not the first time I had to stop playing Fortnite, I don't know why Epic broke many times this way of play, it came back every time because of others complains, this time I don't know were they are. Even if the last come back make the game run at 20 fps with negative acceleration for me, i kept playing that way, and hope I will be able to do it again.

The newest snowfall loading screen tells us that The Ice King was never supposed to wake up. He was supposed to be frozen in time forever. When his island accidentally collided with ours, the new climate started melting the ice. 


Now why is he worried about being awake? Well it was leaked that in the dungeon of Polar Peak, there is an arm that is chained to the ceiling. This is the Fire King, or the snowfall skin. 

My theory is that the Fire King was causing trouble so the Ice King came in and saved the day. However, this can at a cost. To freeze the Fire King he also had to freeze himself, so when he realized he was thawing, he realized that the Fire King must be thawing too.

Will this all happen? Probably not. It just makes the most sense in my opinion. If there are any problems please leave a comment. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

I can't understand why there isn't an option where it warns you before purchase. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not 100% if this is true but I play on the PS4 and I believe to test out sounds, you had to press the Square button, now it's L3. Over the past week, I have accidentally purchased two items and had to use two tickets to refund myself back (what a waste). 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't tend to spend money on this game but I like to save up V-Bucks from Battle Pass's and sometimes either buy a skin/glider/pickaxe or wait for the new season Battle Pass but I'd much appreciate it and I'm sure many others will if there was an option/warning message before purchase... I have one ticket left to last me a lifetime.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S, my finger is well away from the square button now.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I being too much of an idiot or am I making a valid point?

In the v7.20 Patch Notes we had a line that read:

* Editing a structure will now begin without waiting for a response from the server. This should cut down on ghost shots before editing and make it a smoother experience.

 * Confirming the edit will still require sending data to the server and be impacted by high ping or poor server performance.

&amp;nbsp;

Unfortunately, due to an issue that was preventing players from being able to shoot after jumping from the Battle Bus, we've had to revert that improved functionality. For the time being, editing will now react the same way it did prior to v7.20.

&amp;nbsp;

Fear not! All improvements listed above will be re-added to Patch v7.30.

When ATKs were added, shopping carts were already pretty much useless. When we got quadcrashers, shopping carts became completely useless. Shopping carts used to be something special, but Epic ruined them by adding faster vehicles that can hold more people. 

ATKs are also useless. When ATKs were added back in Season 5, it was amazing. You could get to the zone with your squad much faster. When quadcrashers were added, ATKs became very unpopular to use because everyone was using quadcrashers. Don't go and comment, ""ATKs can hold more people, so they aren't useless."" Yes, they hold more people, but when was the last time you saw an ATK with 4 people in it? Exactly.

The only useful vehicles are quadcrashers and airplanes. I don't want any vehicles to be removed, but they need to reduce the spawnrate of airplanes and quadcrashers. Seriously, quadcrashers are everywhere.",FortNiteBR

You can't just shoot them down because of the constant damage and threat they can pose by shooting and crashing into you, and whatever amount of health they have is too much, especially with how impossible it is to land shots on them without getting destroyed by them, and if you do manage to shoot them down they can glide out of the plane, so you're at a massive disadvantage yet again. 

I think to balance it, Epic needs to nerf the health, make it so the planes take more damage by crashing into structures, and disable gliding out of planes. This would enable a risk-reward system with them, where you could grab them for increased mobility, but you're extremely vulnerable, and if you start getting shot at you need to start to land.

Right now, the best strategy is just to grab a couple guns and a plane, and dive bomb everyone, doing insane damage by crashing into players and shooting them, and even if you get your plane shot out, don't worry, you can glide down to a higher place than your opponent and have the high ground. 

It's becoming impossible to win without using this strategy, and it's extremely unfair towards people in game without planes. They have no clear counters that dont involve being lucky enough to find a minigun or mounted turret, and it's extremely frustrating to get trounced by this ridiculous strategy. 

Please, Epic, nerf the plane. Lower health, take damage by crashing through player structures, less damage done by bullets is all I want so I can play the game without 50 kamikaze pilots divebombing at me. ",FortNiteBR

If we have fill on in squads, so far 100% of the time the person filled has been a Switch player. These lobbies seem much more sweaty than normal PS4 or Xbox servers; have run into multiple games with someone at the end having 10-20+ kills fairly often. Have also ran into the same people once-two times back to back to back. Have also had a lobby queue up and deploy with only 56 players in it, some being from the lobby we had just died in. 

So the question is, if having a PS4 and Xbox player in a lobby, and queue into a squad game, are we getting PC players in there also or is it just more PS4/Xbox crossplayers with Switch players also? I see lots of people with streamer mode enabled, and pretty nutty building skills. Honestly almost seems like PC lobbies, but it‚Äôs been a bit since I‚Äôve queued into one of those on purpose with a keyboard connected.

If this isn‚Äôt enough they could also make the guns less precise but then I feel like it would be too much.

Overall I thought it‚Äôd hate the planes but I‚Äôm having an absolute BLAST great season Epic",FortNiteBR

or maybe its a special effect that builds up as you kill people

i also want it to have more then one atk types like holding down left click for power atk or jump + left click for ground smash

The planes are amazing and i love the weapon and battle pass skins. Overall a pretty good season. But there are still problems that aren't making this game the best it can be. Bloom is still a major problem. This is a mechanic in the game that i personally hate the most. This gives people with terrible aim a better chance at winning a gun fight. I know that in most battles you can just build but thats another problem. Materials are nerfed so you get less of them and they dont have much health. This means that smgs can be used to rip apart structures and it requires no skill. It sucks that this game doesn't give skilled players an advantage. This game has become purely luck. Its the roll of a dice if you win or not. I really hoped Epic hears from the community because at the end of the day its the people who play this game that matter.,FortNiteBR

Planes offer an easy rotation, a means to quickly gank other players by simply kamikaze'ing their builds and dropping right in their face all while taking NO damage from the plane at all. People flying planes can make crazy absurd plays and not get punished at all, if somehow you manage to destroy the plane the passengers simply fly far away, or after having taken out most of your building and HP, glide into the perfect position to attack you. There is 0 reward in engaging someone flying a plane if you're on the ground, if you take shots they have your position, attempting to destroy the plane gives them the perfect opportunity to beam you or simply fly right into you, destroying your builds/ pushing you off your structures. You might manage to destroy their plane, but they can either A. Glide to you and kill you, B. Glide away. Furthermore, wtf is up with planes being able to crash into you (which causes you to take damage) or the ground/builds without the passengers taking ANY damage at all - quads give fall damage, planes do not... ???? Plane VS Plane combat is extremely unsatisfying and pointless, my squad currently use planes to find easy third parties and nosedive right into squads with virtually no repercussions. Was this really what Epic imagined when they designed/ ""tested"" these planes? 

I think some potential changes that can be made to planes are 

* Remove the glider redeploy function
* Add explosion damage when the plane blows up 
* Add player damage when crashing into structures/terrain 
* Make it easier to hit players on the planes 
* Lower plane HP
* Reduce spawn rate/locations

Do bear in mind that I'm not suggesting every single one of these changes are made, planes are fun and a great concept, however, implementing planes in their current form was a mistake - I would love to see them balanced like Quadcrashers and ATKs, not nerfed to a ridiculous level. Please let me know your thoughts on the current state of planes. ",FortNiteBR

I understand the planes are fun and all but hear me out. The planes have too much health and can ram your structures for too long. Its particularly annoying in squads where it happens most. I believe reducing the overall health on the planes and adding a penalty on hp once it blows up would create a happy medium. The mobility on them is unmatched and I think that should be above all their #1 purpose.

I am honestly tired of this. I think it was ridiculous that they gave OG skull troopers an extra style, but I can at least understand it since skull trooper came out on oct 26. But people actually want OG styles for skins that last came out in January?! These are holiday skins you should not be rewared for buying them early so please stop begging for a style and just realize that its just a skin in a game and move on if your ""rare"" skin come back. No one really cares if you have rare skins. Them giving the OGs extra styles will not be a good idea also since when christmas skins came out many people were playing so it is not fair that some people will be considered OG because they were able to spend money while others were not. If they do decide to give the original owners extra styles(which I do NOT think they should) they should at least give all the players that were playing back then but were not fortunate enough to buy them. Because most players wanted these skins when they came out but their conditions did not allow them. Maybe they were not able to buy stuff or they could not log in at the time these skins were out or their parents would not let them buy skins. Being OG does not mean that you spent money early, it means that you played early. And this is not because I want an extra style even though I did not buy these skins but played when they were out. As I said, they should not even give styles anyway. And when skull trooper came back, people who played when he came out in S1 should have got the style as well, just because they were not able to spend money does not mean that they do not deserve OG status.",FortNiteBR

I picked up a heavy shotgun today.  
If you check the raw damage on a purple one, it says it only does 75 damage max. I think a gold one is 80 or 85 damage max.

This makes that shotgun fucking redundant because a green pump does 95 damage max. 
A GREEN PUMP! 

A blue one does 100 damage max. 

Why even pick up that gun if it's weaker then all the other pumps? 

This gun either needs to do 95-100 damage, or have it be as readily available as the heavy AR with a blue variant like someone else suggested with it tweaked to be used more like a tac shotgun. 

A fucking green tac can do 70 max but it's auto and will fuck you up.

There's no reason to have the OG Heavy be completely redundant as it is. ",FortNiteBR

Here is some backstory: Previously I would average around 30 ping with no issues. Randomly about two weeks ago I started getting around 50 which I thought was odd because no changes were made. After doing a bunch of troubleshooting on my end and dealing with my internet provider, everything look good to go except and error on my modem. I still had my modem under warranty so I had replaced it AND upgraded to a new package of 300-30 for my internet. Even with doing both of these I am experiencing 50-70 ping consistently and it won't go any lower. I have tried every trouble shooting step to my knowledge for example, restarting modem, flushdns, uninstalling fortnite etc. One of the issues I see is when I go to look at my region in settings it says auto is 30 ping but when I get in game it is double that. I am really experiencing issues here on BR and I am not sure where to go. I understand a lot of people will say 60 is not a lot but it seems like it is more than that with random stutters, can't even jump properly and things like that.

Players fail to understand they want skins because they‚Äôre rare. When they finally do release them Epic makes a ton of money, and plenty of people are left disappointed because the skin becomes more common than defaults. 

You guys can say whatever you want about OG‚Äôs being babies. Don‚Äôt be mad because you missed out on exclusive holiday skins burying your noses in other useless games from September 2017 to March 2018.

Firstly let me say, I love Fortnite. I think as a gamer we can all appreciate what Nintendo have done for gaming and their new console isn't exempt from that. Yes, it's no secret that the Nintendo Switch is the least powerful of the current lineup. But it's small form factor and portability is appealing to many gamers. Especially the older generation that have busy life styles who try to find time to game when and where they can.

Sadly, since it's release Fortnite has seen a whirlpool of good patches and bad patches. There was a point where the game was very playable. I believe 5.20 was the best performance wise. Sadly, since then the game hasn't seen improvements on the Switch but the opposite. It's no secret that Fortnite struggles to hit 30FPS at the best of times. It leaves a lot to be desired and many on the platform have abandoned it entirely. I however, want to see Fortnite exceed on the Switch. I tirelessly tweet and post on Reddit to try and get the game improved on the Switch.

I honestly would prefer solid 60FPS and mobile graphics. But, this isn't the main issue. The main issue is the horrible rubber banding and server lag that happens on the Switch. This doesn't happen on my internet connection on other platforms. Now the game is littered with crashes.

Personally what I would like is more communication between EPIC and it's community on what is happening, whether you are even are of these issues. Surely some of your staff must play on the Switch and realise this? The lack of communication on these issues makes it feel like the Switch isn't really cared about. In the grand scheme of things it probably isn't a priority because the player base is small, but it's only getting smaller as people are just not enjoying the Switch version.

I would like a Trello board dedicated to Switch issues. I think this port does not fit within console or mobile but in its own space.

Thanks,
Siltar",FortNiteBR

I feel that ever since Season 5 came out, that Fortnite has started to feel less and less like the game back in the older days (2-4). The new map changes, the vehicles, and the skins just feel like they don't belong. The new update makes it feel especially like that for me. I liked the old map, and I liked the way it worked in the game. The new map just feels out of place and unwanted. I also think that the planes sort of crossed the lines. What game is this now? I don't want to be killed by a) some streamer going for plane shots or b) some default who crashes to get kills. It just doesn't seem to fit into what I remember about Fortnite in seasons 1-4.... When it was a relaxing game that didn't need to grind tiers, when it was different than other battle royale games. Now it is just a face in the crowd.

Dear Epic Games,

Congratulations on another successful season launch. After seeing the excitement on social media the last few days, I too, was eager to log on today. I landed Pleasant Park, at the house with the newly moved car and was immediately hyped. I was alone at Pleasant, looted the entire place to get two half shields. ""Whatever, let's go check out the plane atop the mountain."" Planes seem cool enough but I didn't like the idea of 3rd partying people from the sky, so I got out to join the action. I quickly realized that edit delay is still very much in the game (even on fiber optic). I also quickly realized that ghost shooting with pump shotguns are still in the game as is the unwarranted shotgun delay that is tradition when ghost shooting in critical close quarters situations. I never thought I would uninstall, being an avid solo scrimmer and streamer, but today I have had enough. 

Carpe Diem, Epic Games and Bon Voyage!",FortNiteBR

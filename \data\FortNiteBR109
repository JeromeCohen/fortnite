And this happens in places where there are no challenges to kill people. These players go out of their way just to get an elimination before dying rather than continue to play the game and start fighting my teammates. 

&amp;#x200B;

If my teammates aren't around to fight him then that's one thing and I get it (need the mats, ammo, weapons, challenges, etc.). However, if you are clearly being damaged by other players, why are people constantly going out of their way to get a single kill? The amount of toxicity is so annoying because now I don't get to play, I just get to watch my squad continue to kill said toxic person and go about the game; rather than the toxic person trying to kill my squad and/or getting the chance at revival.

So... I got killed when the Ice King event happened, and wrote a nice letter to the EpicGames support because I was tilted that I didnt see the event live. Then I came up with the idea: defibrillators.

These items would be available in the first 1-2 minutes if the game. And you could revive your teammates with it who got instantly thursted by the toxic people who cant make it out from the first fights in the game.

This item would be epic or legendary quality. 

This was on my mind. 😅

Some people believe that the Ice King is a good guy, a lot of people thinks that he is a bad guy, this theory will be going over to the more ""bad guy"" part of things. So without further a do, ill first tell you the story, and then provide my logic in thinking this is going to be the snowfall skin. So lets get to it!

&amp;#x200B;

The Ice King ruled over a land that we do not know the name of, nor do we have any information about this mysterious place. But what we do know is that this land was ruled by the elements.  The land used to live in harmony, each element helping the other. One day, the Ice King took the thrown, and being a king allowed the man to become greedy, and power hungry. He used his spell on the land and attacked the other elements, summoning the ice legion to fight for him in war. One day, a hero appeared to challenge the Ice King to save the lands from his wraith. This was none other than the main character and owner of the Infinity Blade. The hero however failed, and the Ice King, hungry to become more powerful, stole the Infinity Blade from its owner, and locked the owner in his dungeon, torturing him and keeping him imprisoned, which was suppose to be forever. The warrior was not easy to defeat however, and therefor weakened the Ice King massively. The enemy elements where attacking, and the Ice King grew weary of his impending defeat. In a final desperate move, he covered his kingdom in a deep freeze that was never suppose to thaw, and with the last of his power, he detached his kingdom from the lands, drifting off into the ocean...never to be seen again. (he placed an ice storm above the kingdom to keep the ice cold)

&amp;#x200B;

Many decades later, his kingdom drifted off into an unknown island. This island of course is the Battle Royal Island. The kingdom collided with the island, destroying many things, and giving birth to the snow biome. The impact of the collision however, awakened the trapped prisoner who possessed the Infinity Blade. Using a great elemental spell, he started to melt the snow, so he could soon, slowly but surely, make his way out into the surface to defeat the Ice King once and for all! The ice was thawing, and as a result, the Ice King woke up from his slumber, and brought him into a panic, saying the quote ""Why am I awake? The ice was never suppose to thaw"". He knew he had to do something quick, as he knew that the powerful prisoner would escape, and with him being weakened, would surely defeat him this time around. So he used the same spell he used on his home land, and put the Battle Royal Island in a deep freeze, to ruin the prisoners progress, and to rule over a land once more, attempting to destroy the natives of the land, and rule through fear. With the prisoner gaining his strength back, he will soon use an even more powerful fire spell, being enough for him to escape once and for all! Resulting in a final showdown between the Ice King and him!

&amp;#x200B;

When I made this theory, I was mostly just thinking about the Infinity Blade. Its a known fact that the Infinity Blade was suppose to play a part in the story line, but was too OP and was vaulted. Let me know what you think of this theory. I know its a little **far fetched.** Feel free to debate and all, I just decided to make this theory since no one was considering what role the Infinity Blade played in the whole story. Now here are some things to think about:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The story is correct, but instead, the prisoner is the Fire King
2. The five elements ruled one kingdom, but the Ice King overthrew everyone",FortNiteBR

I have played 250 hours of forntie. I am just so mad about people who play ONLY fortnite. I can't understand how people haven't got bored of it. Someone would say: Oh, but let kids play this game, they can't pay for games so they play fortnite because it's free. If you think that's the truth.... YOU ARE FREAKING WRONG. The majority of children playing fortnite has spent 20-200 bucks for COSMETIC ITEMS. The prefer changing the colour of the pixels on their screen and doing different dance moves than HAVING A WHOLE NEW and possibly better EXPERIENCE!!! Why? I just cannot understand it. When those kids grow up they will only know fortnite-like games and the developers will start making battle royal games and SINGLE PLAYER GAMES will die. Then, another trend will appear and fortnite will become old-fashioned. AND IT'S NOT EVEN GOOD. There are games for everyone to enjoy but they prefer giving their money to fortnite than buying other games. And it's not because it is the best game. It's because it's a trend and many famous youtubers play it. And that 'DEFAULTS BULLING' thing has made children wanting to have better skins. So I suggest we STOP PLAYING FORTNITE so that this trend gets old and everyone enjoys many different games. ",FortNiteBR

It slowed down the game, and makes mid game a lot more consistent. Mid game isnt nearly as overwhelming and hectic as before, and it is more drawn out like early fortnite.  
While I do agree that it kinda lowers the skill gap, and late game is hell, its definitely nice mid game.  
It can do with a slight decrease to where it isnt as strong and you can only see a few feet in front of you, but I think it should stay in the game to some degree.",FortNiteBR

**Heavy Shotgun:**

* No change

As it is, I think the heavy shotgun is in a pretty good place compared to the other shotguns. It's got slightly lower damage than the pumps, but it has much better range.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pump Shotgun:**

* Change Green / Blue / Purple / Gold body shot damage to 80 / 85 / 90 / 95
* Change headshot multiplier to 2.5 (Max damage 200 / 212.5 / 225 / 237.5)

If these changes were implemented for the pump shotgun, there would be no more cheesy 100+ damage body shots, and all pumps would be able to one-shot someone with full shields. This would also eliminate the massive difference between the green and blue rarities, because no other type of gun has such an enormous increase in power just between 1 rarity level.

**Tac Shotgun:**

* Revert environmental damage nerfs
* Change headshot multiplier to 2.5 (Max damage 167.5 / 175 / 185)

I think we can all agree that the tac shotgun needs some love, and it hasn't been touched since it was nerfed all the way back in season 4. With a damage increase to both players and structures, I think the tac shotgun could become a viable choice again.

**All shotguns:**

* Remove the mechanic where 3 pellets worth of damage are applied when 1 or 2 pellets hit

&amp;#x200B;

Now for the potentially controversial part, just bear with me.

&amp;#x200B;

I know a lot of people dislike double shotgun, but I personally would like to see it return, and with the changes listed above, I think it would be balanced and add more weapon variety to the game, and Epic has said they wanted to add more loadout variety in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

I think double shotgun would be balanced with these changes because double pump or double heavy would still be quite effectively countered by building due to low environmental damage, but the pump-tac or heavy-tac combo would more effectively counter builds to give it an edge over the other double shotgun combos. Pump-tac could then also compete with the ability of pump-smg and pump-deagle to destroy builds. The reduction to pump body shot damage also serves to make it impossible to 2 shot someone with a couple quick 100+ damage body shots while double pumping, while the extra headshot damage on pumps would still make single pump loadouts viable.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you guys think.",FortNiteBR

If your team survives, then you are forced to spectate for what seems like ages. I've been thinking about the subject for a good while now, and I'm trying to think of both sides of the issue.    


I suggest changing the entire downing feature.    
\- When a player is killed, they would lose all their items and become knocked/downed.   
\- The Player that is knocked would be invinsible, and only take damage from natural things like bleeding out, storm, ect.    


Why?   
People who kill knocked players, not to be just toxic, are looking for ammo/guns. The goal is to still let players get loot and to stop players from being toxic. If your team kills the entire enemy squad, you can still get your loot back from them. If the player gets away, there is still a punishment for being knocked rather than just dying and not playing the game anymore.    


My idea is kind of game changing, but I'm getting really tired of people who know they will die from my teammate and so they go out their way to finish me before they die. I hope Epic can see this change to help with in-game toxicity, or use it to start a discussion. ",FortNiteBR

But with Kevin being most likely the Storm King, and being to directly interfere with the island. I am wondering if it is something different.

I believe it is a trap. A dungeon universe where different people from many realities get lost in.

In StW we come across reality anomalies. Where things that shouldn’t exist materialise the closer you get to the storm kings realm. 

In BR we have creatures like Fishstick existing alongside a whole menagerie of strange characters. Where death is not an escape. 

I believe the BR island (and the creative island that surround it) are a pocket universe formed from the storms reality warping abilities.

This also makes me wonder more about characters like the visitor. Who I believe is Dr Vinderman. If he survived the explosion, this could be where he got trapped. The rocket was a way to escape the pocket universe, or perhaps an attempt to trap the storm king on the island. ",FortNiteBR

I turned and waited for you to get it to low health.  I then shot it in the head a few times with the crossbow (while you reloaded) and stole credit for the kill.  I then went back to killing my zombies.  Shortly after, you came over and lit me up, eliminating me (karma right?).  I meant to message you to apologize but I left the game too quickly out of habit.

Aim-Shroud
I mean who hasn't seen some of his clips. He played CS:GO and still does which explains alot. Many consider him the god of aim.

Building-Tfue

What I mean by this is that skilled players hated the SPRAY AND PRAY meta but players that start the game liked it because it gives them a chance. I am not saying that new players are dumb or silly or that I am a pro. I started in S0 and I am an average player. So let's start the rankings from worst to best.

If you are here just for the ranking here you go:
[Worse]
-Season 5
-Season 6
-Season 4
-Season 7
-Season 0
-Season 1
-Season 2
-Season 3
[Best]

Season 5
The spray and prag meta... in this season we will see building and shotgun nerfs and spray (RNG) buffs (what i mean is more of does kind of weapons). This means that a skilled or average player will not have fun and that buildfights are impossible because of shooting down. Battle pass was particularly bad (I mean skins etc...).

Season 6
The spray meta was still there but not as bad still not very fun. Map changes were good and battle pass was good. Extra points for cube event.

Season 4 
This season was good but not as good as the top ones, it was basicly average. Map changes were good, battle pass was ok and the meta was fine. Shotguns did damage although in end season spray and pray started.

Season 7 
This season is ok and to be fair I love creative and the battle pass is good. Shotguns are kind of balenced (a little buff would be nice).

Season 0
Some un balanced stuff and overall not very good graphics but double pump saves it and the meta was fine. Building was good even if nobody could build...

Season 1 
Great meta, and basicly the same as S0 but a little more balanced.

Season 2
First battle pass. And same as S1 but more balanced .

Season 3
By far the best season with a great battle pass and great meta. And TILTED TOWERS! great map changes.

Thanks for reading all this please leave you opinion.

-Nerf of Shotguns
Now I know that Epic have buffed them in the last   Month but I still feel like season 3 shotguns where perfect. Rewarding for close combat and brings more risk to the game but in season 7 you just SPRAY AND PRAY.

-Building nerf
So Fortnite is known for building and that is why I play it but with resent building nerfs and item additions (aka. BoomBox LOL) building has become messed up. I love buildfights but beeing shot down in the middle or just beeing spamed at is honestly boring.

-RNG
So I have pointed out spaming allot now and I think everyone hates that and the big problem with this mechanisms is RNG. RNG is random and grants no advantage for skilled players who have aim.

- POI's not loading in properly
- Players loading in as the same skin in the lobby

**PLEASE NOTE:**


Please, please, please, follow the format and check if the issue has already been posted. We will delete it otherwise. If you want to say, ""Hey, this bug is happening to me too."" then just reply to the comment. If you think you have a potential fix to a listed bug then just reply to the comment. The point of this thread is to have a collection of bugs that are presented in a way to help the devs out by providing more info than simply just, ""Hey, x is going on. Fix it pls, ty,"" and having the upvote system sort the bugs by severity and frequency instead of just repeating the same bug a hundred times, and hiding lesser severe/frequent bugs that may have also been able to brought to attention if one didn't have to wade through a torrent of comments about the game not fitting on their screen.
Thank you.",FortNiteBR

I know it's a battle pass item and they are a one time thing. But this is just an idea and I want to see if anyone agrees or understands. And to all the people that are gonna get shook reading this because they want all the skins to be rare I think I have a solution. So I was actually in the hospital with family that last week of Season 4. And no this is not something you can just control. Nor is it something you should put a video game over. And I bet a lot of other people had a situation like this preventing them from getting it. So I'm not asking them to bring back a battle pass or give omega back to everyone. My idea is they give the chance to get lights back to people that hit 75 or over. That were really close and would still keep the skin not given to everyone. What do you guys think? Personally I was at 79 and then a family emergency happened so I almost had it. And yes I know it's just a skin, I just thought it would be cool to have in my locker. Did anyone else not get the omega lights because of something that happened? ",FortNiteBR

Now, I understand that people can have their own opinions blah blah but having NAZI in your name just ain't right for a PEGI 12+ game. Now, yes it is obviously on PC and the PC spectrum is older than the console spectrum, you shouldn't be allowed to have anything racist in ANY kind of username. Yes, I myself have done it in other 18+ games. But in a kids game, it's delusional. Especially if you have younger than 12's playing. Although to others it may not be offensive, but at the time my friend playing with me (he is 12+) was heavily offended by such username. He's Jewish and I understand that now Nazi's are no longer a thing but it's absolutely stupid. Like are the ""authenticators"" high or something? Because clearly that is offensive as fuck. Sorry for the rant, I hope they make it so you cannot use special characters. Can we possibly try get some exposure on this post?

-Nerf of Shotguns
Now I know that Epic have buffed them in the last   Month but I still feel like season 3 shotguns where perfect. Rewarding for close combat and brings more risk to the game but in season 7 you just SPRAY AND PRAY.

-Building nerf
So Fortnite is known for building and that is why I play it but with resent building nerfs and item additions (aka. BoomBox LOL) building has become messed up. I love buildfights but beeing shot down in the middle or just beeing spamed at is honestly boring.

-RNG
So I have pointed out spaming allot now and I think everyone hates that and the big problem with this mechanisms is RNG. RNG is random and grants no advantage for skilled players who have aim.

If you keep your enemy just outside of true shotgun range it absolutely melts players while they are pumping you for minimal damage. It is also incredible if you get close to two players batting and 3rd party with it. It can even kill players faster than they can pull out there builds if you hit your shots.

A much more common way for this to happen is to knock someone from a distance and get eliminated while they are still knocked. If they die after you the elimination only shows up as an assist.

Didn't register. Just the simple act of falling was making the server de-register the shot because i was now 'too far' from the location i shot the bullet at (falling in the air), from where i am now (on the ground).

&amp;#x200B;

Checked the replay(which is client side), and it clearly shows my shot hitting him, but no damage. So my client very much sent the shot.

Same thing happened with a scar. Went over a hill, and there was someone right there, put a good 3-4 controlled shots into them, but only one registered with damage. If they all registered, the guy would of been dead.

The Scoped AR is most likely one of those weapons.

Similarly, what is the point of the Scoped Revolver? There is already a legendary pistol (hand cannon) that can do a lot of damage close range and far range. Plus it can one shot wooden platforms. Sometimes brick &amp; metal, depending on the HP. If I wanted a Scoped weapon I would use a sniper or a thermal scoped AR.

Make it hurt more.,"hey Epic. One thing which really bothers me about Team Rumble is how amazing suicide is as a strategy, often. 

The number 1 issue is when you can rocket launcher the ground right  next to yourself and get a kill +die at the same time. The result is +1 kill for your team. Out of 100 needed kills in a match this is super powerful. Its ""op"" in a very meaningful way. 

Another problem is any time you get low HP you can simply kill yourself to respawn with full HP and deny the other team that +1 the would get if someone finishes you off. 

My proposition is simple and I think it avoids any ""trolling"" or abuse potential associated with other possible changes. 

Simply give anyone who suicides a small time out. Like add +30 seconds to the respawn timer if you suicide. then your team will be down 1 person for 30 seconds, and you can't just kill yourself willy nilly to reap the benefit, your team will face slightly more imbalanced encounters for that half minute while you are gone. 

Please , seriously consider it. This mode is pretty great. It's the second best LTM after 50v50 in my mind. But it could be better, easily. And this suicide issue is by far the biggest problem with the mode. Suicide should not be a top level strategy. Period. ",FortNiteBR

Nerfed Damage when Hit by Own Weapons:

When you are hit by your own weapons that you shot/threw at other players, (Grenades, Missiles, etc.) the damage you (and your teammates) take will be drastically nerfed by a certain amount.

&amp;#x200B;

The Suppressor Item:

Naturally spawning suppressed guns will be removed and will be replaced with the Suppressor. (The Suppressor will have a smaller spawn rate of suppressed guns) When you have the Suppressor, in your inventory, you can drag the Suppressor onto a SCAR or a Sniper Rifle. (The two types of guns that have a suppressed form currently) When you drag it onto the gun, you must stay still for 7.5 seconds you your character can ""equip"" it to the gun. When it is completed, the gun will turn that gun into it's suppressed form!

&amp;#x200B;

Drop the L Emote:

This emote will be just like the Take the L emote, but 2 giant speakers will appear beside you and a bass-filled remix of the Take the L song will play along with shock-waves being produced from the speakers.

&amp;#x200B;

Possession LTM:

When starting a new game, it will be just like a normal game. However, after 1 minute after everyone jumps off of the Battle Bus, 5 random players will become ""possessed."" Possessed players have much more health and shield than normal players. Possessed players can be differentiated by a red aura that surrounds them. When a possessed player kills a normal player, the killed player will be possessed and will be on the possessed team. Dying from the storm, fall damage, or other reasons that don't involve possessed players won't turn you into a possessed player and you will respawn normally.

I noticed that the Ducky One 2 Mini is blowing up because of Tfue. I just wanted to help out and maybe make it a little easier to find a nice keyboard for your budget. So here is some basic knowledge about keyboards.   


\*NEVER GET A MAINSTREAM GAMING BRAND!\*  
A lot of people seem to be into logitech, corsair, razer, steelseries, etc. especially Corsair. Little known fact is, these are some of the worst quality keyboards you can buy. They all have a very cheap construction, thin ABS plastic, and sometimes even non-standard layouts. This can be really annoying when trying to replace the keycaps. In addition, Corsair uses cherry switches. I will talk about that in the next section. But for this section, I wanted to emphasize that mainstream is never the way to go, unless you find those keyboards for $40. That's a pretty decent price for what you get.  


\*Lets Talk Switches..\*

So another thing most people tend to overlook is switches. Switch brand really does matter! Due to the popularity of cherry, gamers tend to purchase boards with cherry switches since it is so easy to find and supposedly the best switch. But this is not the case! Cherry is 9 times out of 10 inconsistent with their switches, very scratchy, and have cheap springs. If you are looking to get a new keyboard, I would highly recommend gateron or kailh switches. Kailh is well known for their box switches, which have a distinct box shape around the stem, hence the name, box switches. I personally really love the kailh box browns(tactile) and box jades(clicky). If you are planning on buying Oem or Cherry profile keycaps, they're perfect. Otherwise I would definitely go gateron. Personally I am a huge fan of V2 Zealios(tactile) and V2 Tealios(linear). They are actually my favorite switches of the type!   


\*Quality!!!\*  
So a lot of mainstream keyboards use ABS plastic, which helps cut down costs so they can earn and even MORE unreasonable profit. If you are looking at high quality keycaps, ABS shouldn't matter. But at a budget like this, ABS is very weak and will break if you push too hard too many times. PBT plastic is what you want. In addition, a lot of people tend to believe Corsair is high quality due to the Aluminum in parts of the build. Yes, that is pretty decent quality, but why does it matter? If anything, it shows that they are cheaping out! If they can afford aluminum why not make the whole body aluminum for a better deck!?  


\*Pre-Built's I would recommend\*  
\-Vortex Pok3r (Wow there's a streamer that uses this!)  
\-Varmillo Va87m  
\-Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro S  
\-KBDfans 60%(Amazing option!)  
\-Massdrop Alt

\-Ducky Shine 6  
\-Glorious GMMK(I LOVE THIS KEYBOARD!!)

So does that mean that Tilted might be going too?!?!? My theory is that Tilted May be a major target for next season.

Here's my theory, so some war again'st the Fire king and the Ice king happened and the Ice king won the fight and  
chained up the Fire king in the dungeon after this the Ice king eventually froze his whole palace with snow and ice and he fell asleep, eventually the iceberg drifted towords the Fortnite Island causing the Iceberg to melt since the temperature is very different on the Fortnite Island, eventually the Ice king awakens wondering why he is awake as seen in Week 7 Loading Screen Description, after he awakens he checks to see how everything is and where he is at, he sees that everything is melting and that he is on a Island, so he goes to check the dungeon area and he sees that it is melting and the Fire king might escape so, the Ice king creates a Ice ball in the sky above Polar Peak to make sure everything is cold and frozen over so that the Fire king doesn't awaken from his sleep, the Ice king eventually gain's enough power from whatever he is doing in the Ice ball so he bursts open causing a ghostly figure to appear behind him so he is big enough to cause a huge Snow Storm Cloud to freeze and cover the Fortnite Island so that the Iceking doesn't awaken and try to escape, (Now here is what i think will eventually happen) so I believe the Dragon egg's will eventually hatch during the time of Week 9 and somehow release/break out the Fire king allowing him to Melt everything on the Island causing a massive flood on the Island with some POI's and location's to be flooded over eventually Season 8 Releases and it is Water Theme adding speed boat's and swimming mechanic and fish to swim under water.

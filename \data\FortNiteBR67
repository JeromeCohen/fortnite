Then we have console (sweats but theres bots randomly)

Now we have mobile which is pretty much broken and very under optimized for a game on limited hardware, my phone shouldn’t heat up when I’m playing disco domination and i shouldn’t lose frames towards end game (Medium, Low Power and 76.6% 3D Res) i should be able to play with no problem but Epic Games™️ wont optimize mobile. From my experience this happens a-lot: Random crashing, vehicles on there natural spawn make fortnite crash, losing frames in disco domination, phone heats up randomly even though theres not that many builds, these things shouldn’t be happening even though i play on a 7 month iPhone 8. Besides that Mobile Fortnite is very under optimized for a phone version / port of the game, so could we please get a little bit of love for mobile fortnite it hurts especially for those that don’t have a expensive pc, or  a console / switch to play fortnite on.

So thats the way you should play the game now? to pick up a heavy sniper and wait while hidden in order to annoy or randomly kill someone. 

The only thing I can think of right now is to at least nerf the heavy sniper. The game finally is in some good state but the whole thing with the snipers is ruining a big part of it. ",FortNiteBR

1. Skin edit changes .. i really think you guys should make these changes so these skins can get purchase more 

Raptor havoc and frostbite 
Mask off


Give bandolier a back bling , I really think it should because you guys have recently released the bandollete ( which I copped ) and I think for a rare skin it's is phenomenally better than the bandolier . So please add a back bling for him .. the same goes for funk ops and disco diva .. 


Give ravage an edit style to make her eye colour and feathers change 

Feather and eye colour : red , blue - purple , black , dark grey 
Add the same for raven please 
And also for the back blings 
Dark wings and iron cage feather colour : blue - purple , red , black , dark grey 

Because I personally think the ravage would be so much cooler like  this 


Burnout and redline edit styles 
Helmet on and helmet off
Burnout is Craig and redline is Ramirez 
Armour colour : Black and red or Black and Gold . 
Makes these skins much more worth it 


Since elite agent received edit styles rogue agent should as well 

Omega challenges have been leaked to come back so if they do please add pickaxe colours as well 
( I was 12,000 XP away🤣)

Cloaked shadow styles .. 
It's already red and gold and black 
Can you please make it grey and gold and black .. 


Team leader edit styles .. 
Mask off 
They are all Ramirez but there's a catch 

The cuddle team leader has pink hair 
The fireworks team leader has blue and red hair 
The panda  team leader has black and white hair 
And the spooky team leader has green and grey hair .



Now that's done with the edit styles maybe map changes .. 

Now I love the map as it right now but we need changes 

Moisty mire should return where lonely lodge was 
Anarchy acres is switched with fatal fields .. 
Hay crops are still there ! 
Paradise palms size should reduce allowing moisty to fit in
Race track is spilt between a desert and a swamp to give it a cool effect 
Ziplines are added back to the salty mountain .. 
At every expedition outpost you will find a quad crasher , a drift board and 3 ballers .. 
Polar peak should melt away allowing greasy to come back .. 
So it's now a snow biome instead of a ice biome .. 
If airplanes don't come back I don't see the point of frosty flights 
Lucky landing is enlarged so that's it's a better location .
The volcano should be named 
Vicious volcano 
Loot lake should be named to lovely lake 
So the biomes now are 
Greenland biome 
Jungle biome 
Snowy biome 
Desert biome 
Swamp biome 
Dusty divot should be built over by construction workers so that salty factories 
The dusty depot is now different .. there are three different depots . 
One is the diner . 
The other is factory
And the other is a scientist storage room. .
The factories near flush are named now . 
Frosty factories .. 



Makes the game more fun 
If season 9 is related to natural disasters at the end of season 8 maybe  a volcano event could happen . Destroyinh the whole map which allows new locations 



LTM ideas : 
Solid silver 
Grey weapons only 
Grey pump shotgun added for this mode 
Damage : 90 / 180 

Unvaulted changes : add old map to make the game more fun ..  


8 man solo .. 
I have seen this somewhere where they recreated Fortnite on a PS1 .. so basically there are 8 players available .. you will be placed at any named location on the map with these 8 players .. 
Loot spawn rate increased 
Only rare weapons are found so RNG isn't a problem .
Material harvest rate increased from 40% to 60%
 


I hope you guys like this and I'll make sure to add more next time .. hopefully epic sees this ..

The Ice King wanted to come to BR Island in search of the fragments of what just hit them (Cube Pieces). This is how the story connects.","When Kevin exploded, there were fragments in all directions, some going downward and leaving the jagged pieces we see today, but also plenty that flew outward and away from the site of explosion. Since we were all in the void when this happened, there's no way of knowing just how far the blast went, or how far the radial effect of the void was.

However, it is fair that since there is fragments of pre-rift BR island at the glacier, it is likely that Kevin seeded himself out to other places. A mainland ice world was likely wrecked by Kevin shrapnel, and the decision about what to do was a tenuous one. The Fire King, not yet imprisoned, wants the mainland because he is grounded in earthen principles where being set afloat is not his natural element. But the overwhelming majority of snow-based individuals sought refuge from their ruined place, and ultimately, The Ice King even found the source of the power by using the piece of Cube to wreck the same havoc back onto our island.

Now though, S8, a pirate comes in search of treasure from... we have no idea where. But it is fair to assume he also comes from another direction where Kevin shrapnel affected, causing the inhabitants who survived to turn to a life of crime on the high seas just to get by. Radioactive fish (Fishstick) are a good sign that Kevin has radioactive principles as well.

So S9 will either show another group affected by Kevin shrapnel coming to the source, BR island. Or Kevin's seed will finally come up from the vortex it dripped. The game developers **DID** announce they were working on season 9 when season 6 was in dev, so it could be where they planned all along for Kevin to finally come back. Not S8, but S9.",FortNiteBR

All skins have the ability to come back to the item shop (as stated by EPIC), except the season 1 season shop skins and every battlepass skin. 

When an old skin comes back all the original owners want an OG edit style. Well just stop asking for these styles because in a recent blog they said they are looking for more ways to customize our skins. So OG skin styles are inevitable.

Also this games servers are eventually going to  be shutdown, so in a couple of years you ogs won't even be able to play as those skins.

Lastly, it's just a game. Everyone should be able to have fun playing with whatever skin they like and not be picked on just because they are not OG.

In conclusion, don't harass EPIC or other players because of an OG skin. Appreciate the game for what it is because we only got a few years left before this game gets taken over by the next big game.",FortNiteBR

185,Danmaku7,1552802228,b225mk,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b225mk/megawalls_new_gamemode_suggestion/,14,MEGAWALLS [New Gamemode suggestion],"* **INTRODUCTION:** 

Megawalls is a mostly forgotten class based gamemode where **\[4 teams of 25\]** fight to protect their base and atlas from the opposing teams on a enclosed specialized map that has 4 color coded bases surrounding a large neutral zone.

\~ Each team will have 3minutes of prep time to build and place traps &amp; infinite respawns are provided by the Atlas**(The objective of this mode).** After a teams Atlas is destroyed they will receive no more respawns, class changes,and have to either fight flee or hide around the maps tunnels and buildings untill every other teams atlas is destroyed or risk perma death.

\~After 15 minutes of the match all surviving atlas will be set to 1HP and any base that had their atlas destroyed will have their base consumed by the storm forcing them to the \[Center\] which as the name implies is the center of the map between the four teams bases, where the survivors who managed to survive the initial slaughter of the atlas destruction will fight to the death or make a final push against the surviving atlas to secure perma kills

*\~(Last team standing wins)*

* **THE MAP:** 

The map is divided into four color coded identical bases that are used by four teams, These enclosed bases surround a neutral center area that contains power weapons and Hostile AI enemies and can alternatively be accessed through a underground network of tunnels that are rich in resources,cover and hiding spots connect every base to the center. (Much smaller then the original battle royale map )

&amp;#x200B;

**The bases:** Each teams base are around the size of 2 to 3 tilted tower towns and modeled like a battle royale town with a court yard area and at least 3 ways to access the underground tunnel network 

\~The far end of the base that is furthest away from the center will hold the **ATLAS(Objective)** which is in a building or underground facility that will be heavily guarded by each team

**\~Spawns:** There must be 2 different unbreakable spawn building with multiple exits and a 2 way localized teleporter to safely switch spawns and prevent enemy spawn camping.

\~Each spawn will have a **shop** that you can buy friendly AI to assist in base defense/ medication/ resources/ gadgets/traps/ and special ability upgrades from the kill currency you get throughout the match

\~Each spawn will have a **general locker** that the whole team will be able to access and download items as a form of team support and resource rationing untill the atlas is destroyed all its contents are ejected as floor loot and the spawn buildings disappear.

&amp;#x200B;

\~At the end of the base that is closest to the center is **THE WALL** it is a giant gate that blocks off the center and the base above and below ground and has 3 entry points \[Right gate, left gate, Middle gate\] The wall should be demolishiable as well have roof access to shoot from as well as windows and stairs. Each wall must have a solid color to help identify which base is which.

**The center:** Is what is between each teams base and is a large with either a crater in the ground or a Large building in the center of the courtyard that has a large basement with multiple access points to get to the tunnel networks.

\~The center will have **power weapons** which are very lethal weapons that cannot be obtained by any other means but visiting the center,And are lost and stolen if killed by an enemy.

There will be 9 power weapons in total that spawn each match.

Each team will have a chance to obtain at least 2 as they spawn beyond all bases entry ways of the center both above and below ground and the 9th and best power weapon will spawn directly in the center of the map(Infinity sword, Air strike, Zapatron, perma regain potion,shield overcharge, mythic grade rarity)

\~The center will also have **aggressive AI monsters** that are aggressive and fast, mostly zombies, mist monsters from STW and a aggressive variant of the troll from STW (All modified to be a actual threat to the beefed up players of this mode) it would be cool to see new monsters and animations

Ai monsters of the center should only spawn twice,once at the start of the match &amp; again when all atlases are destroyed to prevent from annoying players to much.

**\~Map theme/Updates:** Unlike the original battle royale always evolving map, megawalls map can just have 4-5 map theme variants as a update that randomly swap around every time you join a game( For example a military theme map, A gray and rainy tundra, another dimension,outer space,or a night themed neon city) This will help to ensure this mode is low maintenance so you guys can focus on the main map.

* **The CLASSES:** 

*Although not 100% necessary it will blow the minds of most people* The 4 classes from Save the world mode*(Ninja, constructor, outlander, and soldier) would go perfectly with this mode as you can recycle almost all of the assets and functions and animations (With some augmentations) Loadouts are set for each class with infinite ammo*

**\~SOLDIERS:** will handle mostly like they do in battle royal as to not alienate people

Loadout: Gold Assualt rifle/ Blue Tactical shotgun/ grenades that leave electric field behind, (Has 7 item slots) (Can use any item)

Stats: Has 200HP and 150Shields/ Has a above average battle royale running speed/ No turbo build/ decreased bloom

**Skills:**the shockwave ability from STW,/ proximity mine from STW(modified to be very small)/ Passive ability of Enemies having a chance to drop medical supplies when killed/ Passive faster Assualt rifle reload

&amp;#x200B;

**\~CONSTRUCTORS:** Will be able to upgrade player built structure to level 3 like in STW

**Loadout:** Blue assualt rifle/ Gold pump shotgun/ Husk stomper hammer from STW(with a chance to stun and guaranteed knockback)/ portable 100 tile teleporter (Has 5 slots)(Can use all shotguns and meelee weapons)

**Skills:** (Turbo build enabled)/B.A.S.E ability from STW (buffed length and deals 5 dmg a second with immunity to bullets)/ Susie turret from STW/ proximity Mine (very small)/ B.A.S.E effect heals teammates who touch building for 2 shields a second

**Stats:**150 HP 250shield/ Average battle royale running speed

&amp;#x200B;

**\~OUTLANDERS:** Has high utility and tracking a nice hit and run class that is challanging but resourceful

**Loadout:** Uzi/gold hand cannon/blue dual pistols/Crossbow/Slow field grenade from STW/ Impulse grenade/ Seismic impact from STW/ Rocket fist guantlet meelee weapon (Has 8 slots) (Can use all pistols and throwables)

**Skills:** hover turret (from STW modified to follow the player), Phase shift (from STW)/ ability to capture AI creatures/ passive Ability to track the closest enemy player on radar/Double yield from everything (Turbo building disabled)

**Stats:**100 HP 100 SHIELD/ faster firing speed with pistols/ passive death burst from STW/ Above average battle royale running speed/ turbo building disabled

&amp;#x200B;

**\~NINJA:** The king of stealth and mobility with high melee damage

**Loadout:** Purple dual pistols/Stormblade sword from STW/ black stink bombs/purple silinced pistol/Grapple hook (Has 5 slots) (Can pick up any silinced weapon or throwable)

**Stats:** 100HP 100SHIELD / Very high run speed compared to default run speed/ Double jumps enabled/ Turbo building disabled

**Skills:** Poisen penetrating shurikan from STW/Dragon slash from STW/passive Life leech when damaging with swords burst Invisibility (That disable if you attack or harmed into a 35sec cooldown) countered by outlander tracking and constructor B.A.S.E

&amp;#x200B;

**+Class change is only possible with active atlas in spawn**

**+All classes must be able to meelee while sprinting and keep momentum to be viable against shotguns and other close range weaponry**

(All classes can pick up ANY power weapons or compatible weapons of the people who are eliminated for 10 seconds before despawn and you will respawn with your classes default loadout /Power weapons do not despawn)

&amp;#x200B;

* **CONCLUSION:**The reason i think this mode will be a huge success is becuase it will definitely bring alot of new things to fortnite and modern battle royale scene. The megawalls concept is almost completely forgotten ever since halo &amp; minecraft fell off everyones radars and it would be a real shame if it were to disappear with it as just a fanmade mod. (Megawalls brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars for 2 minecraft server owners  as well as player loyalty with servers, i was one of them)

\~The balance &amp; functionality of megawalls has been tried and tested and while i think ive balanced it within reason to work in fortnite im sure within a few updates and feedback it can remain at a good state

\~Why i think this suggestion should be added above others 

**\[1\]**The community at large has been begging for both new maps and new modes and new modes have been less frequent the past seasons  especially.

**\[2\]** This mode will consist of mostly already existing assets, animations and models that can be recycled, greatly reducing the work load and will not need to be updated along with the current map in battle royale as it will be its own map with a simple thematic based setting

**\[3\]** Will promote save the world game mode

**I\[4\]**s actually a battle royale unlike alot of other suggestions and superior to the original teams of 25

**\[5\]** Will open the community up to the idea of a seperate objective mode from battle royale like hiest did

**\[Final\] :** This mode will be highly costomizable (for example) taking out the classes and only using the defualt BR shooting model/ changing the 4 teams of 25 into a 50v50 megawalls match that splits the map into two (Thats 3 new game modes already)

**So in conclusion :** fingers cross that someone in power at epic finds my 4 post and at least give me the Nay or Yay (no hard feelings) 

I havent had faith in a games potential this much sense halo's bungie days\~

It is to explain a problem directly linked to the baller vehicle itself, rather than the players using it.


Being in a baller puts you at an immense advantage. Even when two players are right beside each other, they’ll seldom fight each other as long as one is in the vehicle. The person in the ball wouldn’t want to sacrifice their protection and mobility, and the person out of it won’t want to damage the ball, hoping that they’ll be able to get it later (even if they do try to damage the ball, the ball boy will run like Sonic the Hedgehog). If both are in a vehicle, it’s even worse. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone leave a ball to attack another person in a ball. This is mostly a problem in tournaments, where players are further encouraged not to fight because placing well grants points more effectively than getting a high kill count. 

SypherPK shows what I mean perfectly [here](https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=biBGljVXHhA#t=6m40s) (from 6m 40s to 11m 30s). Yes, Sypher eventually leaves his ball to fight, but not without the consequence of having his ball roll away and the risk of getting shot at.

To be honest, I have no idea how to balance this. Unless someone has a good solution this thing is definitely getting vaulted, if not then nerfed until it’s irrelevant, like what happened to turrets and planes. The problem to me isn’t that people aren’t fighting (although this is problem with Epic’s servers), it’s that watching competitive play is uninteresting. I wouldn’t be surprised if during the live streamed tournaments the commentators would have nothing to talk about either. The World Cup is coming soon, and if this isn’t fixed in time we’ll be having some big problems.",FortNiteBR

Maybe This has nothing to do with the Fortnite Community but I feel like I had to put this somewhere my family have always been very supportive of my decision to try and pursue a gaming career and then when I am just not doing anything besides sitting here and trying to get better I feel like I'm not only letting myself down but my entire family.

I could care less about them being good at the game, but I don’t want to have to sweat my butt off everytime I want to get kills. I should be able to just play the game casually and have fun but it’s really hard to do that when every game there is a twitch ttv streamer wearing a soccer skin who is trying to go for the kill record.

I would love to see a skill based matchmaking system implemented (no there is not one in there because there are bots and sweats in the same game all the time) for everyone, including me, who just sometimes want to play the game casually.

Getting a kill with a trap is too easy because of how much damage it does.  Plus, it is quite hard to counter a trap once you're boxed, as you are limited with so much time to escape. Furthermore, if the player is quite fast, once they box you with 2 traps, left and right, they edit to you and start shooting you, with your back against them, while 2 traps are in their box, which is like a 2v1. So, if you don't destroy any traps, you're done for. If you get hit by a trap on one side while destroying the trap on the other side, you're left with only 50 health, and a good enough player, by that time, has edited to you and just has to shoot you a few more times or once in the head and you're dead, just like that.

Therefore, making traps deal only 100 damage will leave you with 100 health, buying you more time/health/help to get out of that trap situation, which is usually pretty hard to counter/protect yourself from.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite mobile, or the laughingstock of platforms, is being neglected by epic and is nearly impossible to play on unless you have a device that came out in the last 12 months. 

So, the pressing issue: Mobile has been paired with Switch servers, which is like PC paired with console. There is a ridiculous skill gap. Matches are dominated by switch players. Most causal players are completely outclassed. If you guys think PC is too sweaty, try having build battles with touch controls vs. controllers. Mobile is also completely unstable. Ping drops, frame drops, graphics bugs; it’s a complete nightmare. Another issue is the ridiculous edit bug, where instead of editing the piece in front of you it instead edits a completely random one. When shooting, taps don’t register. Epic, whether intentional or not, has changed the viewing angle of the camera which messes up sensitivity and makes the gameplay harder. Voice chat currently does not work in some modes. Input lag is also extreme. And one more thing: In tournaments, mobile players are forced to use the default HUD, or touch controls. That’s like making all PC players use default keybinds, but even worse. It severely limits the capabilities of mobile players and is completely unfair. Laugh at competitive mobile all you want, but this is just annoying.

All of this, coupled together, makes mobile nearly impossible to play on and is primarily the reason why i switched to console. I appreciate all you do, Epic, but please, fix your game.",FortNiteBR

It makes it unfair that people that are in a better financial place are able to purchase everything and not earn the tiers/rewards like the average consumer.

Not only does it make it unfair, but makes the game's battle pass much less valuable/cool to have because when you see someone that has a high level tier skin already, that was bought, you don't have much respect for that aspect. When you see someone with a high tier reward, you should be like ""wow, dang, look at them, they have that [earned] skin man! / I want that!"" But if you want it, you gotta earn it.

Also, maybe it would be good/great to make it so that in order to get the next unlock of a specific skin, you have to wear that skin while playing. I feel this would add more value to each skin and giving each skin more ""personality,"" as when you see others with that skin, it would show that that player quite likes that skin/would show they put in effort to become the next level of that skin.",FortNiteBR

Get Rid of the Dance floors on the sides of the line Bring back the dance floor in the middle. People are playing this like it's Team Rumble because they like team rumble so why not add something to fight for in the middle of the circle?

2. Implement the old glider redeploy system. The glider items are an unwanted hassle especially if you pick up a second stack as they both stay in your inventory unless you drop one stack, but even then they cause your stack of 50 to become a stack of 10. Both are used simultaneously if you keep both stacks.

3. Change the dance floor music to the same music as the dance battle music from the challenge in season 7. It would be really cool and actually give more point to the whole dance battle theme.

4. Bring vaulted items into the game. We really dont need infantry rifle and SMG being the only things we find. You can barely find an ar and if you do find shotguns, you find every shotgun ever before you find anything else.

5. Pirate Cannons 100% spawn. The challenge is impossible as is. Atleast make them spawn 100$% of the time.

6. Add some challenges or something for atleast some xp? This is optional. It would atleast give people more of a reason to play disco if you brought out something for us to have to do in disco.

&amp;#x200B;

HOWEVER, especially since the ak nerf, there is a niche spot in the game for the infantry as an early game weapon that has a high skill cap. But since this is the only projectile based rife (not snipers), people seem to hate it. If you have experience with projectile based rifles in other shooters, the more difficult aiming can be worth the tradeoff for higher damage and no damage dropoff. Obviously the small magazine is still a major limiting factor- and it seems like they could use a tiny base damage buff- but I dont think the infantry rifle is worthless/should be vaulted.

1. Increase damge to 33, 34
2. Increase fire rate, but not too much
3. Change variants back to Rare and Epic.

Many people have smoke detectors chirping in the background, indicating the battery is getting low on remaining life. When the battery dies, so does the first warnings of a fire it can provide. 

I would ask that anyone with a chirping smoke detector to please replace the battery. If you hear someone with an intermittent chirp on their mic, ask them if that's a smoke detector and if so to change out the battery.

We look out for each other in squads and it should be no different IRL. It's a simple task to ask your squad mates to check it out or have their parent/guardian check it out. At best it can safe lives and the worst it can do is cost a battery.",FortNiteBR

I don't think the people in this subreddit that hate the IR actually used it for more than 2 seconds, because they tried to a hit a moving target and couldn't calculate for the bullet travel, and when they finally hit one shot, it only did 40 damage and then the enemy built the CN Tower.

Personally, coming from PUBG makes this weapon feel like a breeze as I can calculate the trajectory quicker than Einstein's corpse and hit people for 45 out of the air. What point does this make? Not much but I just wanted to inflate my ego.

In conclusion, I believe that the people on this subreddit should actually *TRY* (I know thats hard for some of you sweaty children who slowly asphyxiate every second they cant do a 90s) the Infantry Rifle, especially now the shit-tier common one is gone. With good damage, a high firerate, and laser-like accuracy, all you need is some skills to lead your shots and you can become a WW2 speed demon. Also, its an M1 Garand with a badass ping. Also, **SPOILERS** a Mk14 Epic/Legendary variant of the Infantry Rifle was leaked, so if a totally *badass* marksmans rifle isn't enough to satisfy your needs, it probably does badass damage too.

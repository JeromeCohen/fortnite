Like think about it you land tilted get shotgun and smg push someone ads with the shotgun (miss or hit them) then switch to the smg and not be able to have any aim assist until 5 seconds later. For the all KB and M players you can not have consistently good aim with a controller with out aim assist due to fact that you play with joysticks. In my opinion Aim Assist never needed nerfed pc players only started complaining about because they felt controller players didn’t have to practice to get good aim unlike them were they have play Kovaaks for a few hours to have decent aim. So please epic revert the change. ,FortNiteBR

Literally last night was a perfect example of when I used up over 1800 materials in the build battle at the end of a game. Now with this new cap I would have only had 1000 resources for that fight (after I spend some earlier) and would’ve died in this battle. 

I hate how Fortnite implements this huge changes so drastically. I’ve been on the fence about this game recently and with Apex Legend becoming more popular, this game is bound to collapse.

Making the next battle pass free for doing a few challenges JUST to try and take away Apex's success. Grow up, Epic. Your game can't be on top forever. Eventually your playerbase is going to drop, what then? You make your overpriced cosmetics free to lure people away from the next big (and easily better) thing? You make so many bad choices with your updates. Each update negatively affects certain players. You've catered the game too much to builders, tryhards and sweats like Ninja and his 8 year old followers instead of actually fixing the game.

Sort your own game out before trying to take away another game's players. Apex's current success is so well deserved, trying to take that away just shows how salty you've become.

Btw, the weekly and daily challenges are the exact same every season. The Clingers got vaulted yet you had a challenge for damage with grenades, stink bombs or clingers this season. It's literally a copy and paste of a previous season's challenges. When the game's broken, you make sure your item shop has new items for players to waste their money on before actually doing anything about the glitches and bugs.

Struggling more and more to enjoy this game every single time I play, and it's all thanks to Epic's lazy, greedy ways.",FortNiteBR
13,carterdmcc,1550143709,aqisb9,63,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aqisb9/for_the_casual_player_these_new_popup_cup_changes/,1,"For the casual player, these new pop-up cup changes are anything but “helpful” or “exciting”.","I would like to air my honest thoughts on the update. I realize that there is a herd mentality on this sub often, and this is a comment from the minority. But I’d like to explain why I’m disappointed with this patch. 

First of all, I understand the move. A new kid just arrived at school. He’s handsome, athletic, and has nice (a)pecks  ;). Fortnite needed to up the scene for the outspoken player base, which seems to be the competitive one. 

Here’s why I believe it’s a bad move for the casual:

The 50hp upon elimination rewards aggressive players. “Well yeah, imagine that. Getting a reward for being good!” I get it. But when they ran this as a trial, Mitr0 dropped back to back to back to back 36/38/42/30whatever kill games! The point of a Battle Royale (IMO) is to be the last alive, NOT necessarily to get the most kills. These changes encourage kills and will leave the more passive players to become the prey. 

The 500 mat cap. I don’t have a fully developed opinion on this yet, but it seems low. Especially if I’m trying to defend myself against try hards. 

Upon elim 150 is dropped? Seriously? I get in a build battle with a sweaty and burn 300 mats. Now I only get 150 max back? Sure, there’s a 40% faster harvest rate so I can build it up quicker, but I wish they’d just give us the opponents remaining mats. 

Moral of the story. Some players don’t play pop up cups. Some players like to feel as if they have a chance. No matter how much I play, I’m not better than 50% of the lobby in most games. Sure, the streamers will be back now and EPIC will see more profits in the long run, but new players and casual will be hard pressed for wins. 

I believe epic should have kept the regular modes and added a “competitive” mode for this is solo/duo/squad. 

TL;DR - this pop up cup format favors aggressive players who are willing to get in engagements throughout the match. It’s no longer about being the last one alive as much as it is getting kills. This should have been a separate “competitive” mode. ",FortNiteBR

Now for number 2.. the final circle distance increased by 48% now that wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the previous point that there is 1500 mats max. Note: I play basically every single pop up I can (with the exception of the share the love pop up, I found that to be the most pointless and it wasn't worth it) I do quite well in them I always earn a pin (like that means anything) but I love playing normal solos when the console vs PC thing annoys me in solos, at least.

I didn't really play when double pump was big and the only times I've seen it were on youtube and twitch but I got the concept and saw how broken it was.

I saw a video about a week ago I forget the title but it's on the lines of 'fortnite was better in season 2' type. And when I watched the guy said that everyone loved double pump and wanted it back? I don't know if that's true or not because it seemed the opposite that no one liked double pump as it was broken.

His point to back up that double pumps should be brought back was that he used to be bad at the game until he started using it. And that's to me explains why double pump got taken out on the first place: as bad player good just get good by learning how to switch weapons fast instead of actually learning skill.

Second of all, I don’t care how smart of a business tactic is to make a game “Free to play” is, epic doesn’t have to allow anyone to play for free. They are allowing you as the player to enjoy the same gameplay experience as other people when it truly comes down to it. You don’t NEED the battlepass, you don’t NEED emotes, and you don’t NEED a single cosmetic item in the game. They are all wants.

The idea is that instead of hitting the edit key 2 times (once to toggle edit, once to confirm edit) you would press and hold the edit key and release the key to confirm.

This would be a setting you can toggle on and off  and would be found in the ""controller custom controls"" or the ""keybord"" sections of the setting

I'm using Ninja for example. His tip was, ""Land Tilted Towers. Keep losing, get better."" I can see his point, but I also think he's taking advantage of people trying to improve at the game. My theory is, Ninja wants people to land Tilted Towers so they think that's how they improve at the game and be as good as their one and only hero Ninja, but no. Ninja is actually using them to farm up easy kills. Tilted Towers is always where Ninja lands to rack up kills, so Ninja invites all the noobs hoping to improve to continuously land Tilted Towers, where Ninja will get kills even faster.

Fortnite doesn't seem to have nearly as many big choke points and Fortnite specializes in defensive building + mobility items, which are great counters to ambushes.

The original Secret Skirmish [announcement](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/news/secret-skirmish-announcement) teased “additional operations” to be held in the evenings after the primary Battle Royale competitions each day. 

The initial plan was to hold a non-Battle Royale competition each night after the Solos and Duos matches to illustrate more competitive options in the Fortnite competitive ecosystem. Unfortunately, after testing on-site, we ran into technical issues that prevent us from holding these bonus competitions with the confidence needed to produce the show. We are removing the secret evening “operations” from the original schedule, and will continue with the Solos and Duos competition as planned. 

The $25,000 prize pool that we had originally set aside for the additional evening competitions will be reallocated into the Duos prize pool. A total of $100,000 will now be up for grabs in the Duos competition, up from $75,000 previously. Solos will remain at the same prizepool with $400,000 up for grabs.

We plan to revisit some of these alternative competitions very soon. We also plan to utilize the in-game tournament system for more concrete support of these kind competitions later in the year.

However, I find that after a few games, I don't feel like going back into the mode anymore. It just gets repetitive very quickly,  and stops being fun. I'm not sure what the solution would be. I wouldn't want 50v50 back because I never found that mode to be that fun, it was also kinda repetitive too, and I really like the idea of respawns. There needs to be a new mode/adjustments to the current mode that makes every game different, just like how no game in br is the same (different bus, landing, situations, loot, etc. Team rumble has none of that). We need a mode like team rumble where every game is different in some way. Idk what that would be, but epic can think of something. ",FortNiteBR

Not putting the same effort or time into something (Fortnite) means that others who do will probably be better than you.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic doesn't have to wipe your behind by catering to your sparse engagement with it's product.

&amp;#x200B;

The 'sweaty' players that you cry about went through the same issues as yourselves when they started playing, only difference being they didn't have playground/creative/rumble to practice.

&amp;#x200B;

Real life variances (tired/drunk/internet issues) effect a players performance. They just got home from a long days work on a Monday afternoon/night tired AF. Why would they want to join a lobby where people have the same K/D they can only achieve on a relaxing Sunday afternoon? This applies for any skill level.

SBMM will put this game in the grave.

I think it's the pinnacle of noob weapons. It has little to no counterplay, and no amount of ammo capacity and reload time nerfs are gonna change that. 

I posted some suggestions a year ago, like greatly lowering player damage while buffing the splash zone, making the rocket start very slow and accelerate, but that piece of shit weapon is still super unfun to play against and use.

Team Rumble made this very clear. Every game comes down to whichever team has the most RPGs, and there's always like 10 people in each team with one. It's so tedious knowing that no matter how skilled you are, some guy is gonna drop right above you and explode you with nothing you can do about it. 

I would even gladly accept it being vaulted. It's insane to me that this gun is still in the game from season 1 and it basically has never been nerfed (apart from the ammo capacity nerf, but that was completely ineffective. Especially in Rumble, where you're never gonna run out.)

And just so people don't say I'm a noob and need to adapt, here's my latest Rumble game where I got 22 kills. https://imgur.com/a/MQF43Sk",FortNiteBR

How is trying to win in a video game considered ""not fun""? Why are people who build to take little to no damage often mocked and satirised like theyre doing something wrong?

What some of you need to understand is that most of us ""sweaties"" have dicked around in pubs, have used goofy wacky items to their full extent, have went through the phase of not building anything in a fight and it gets boring. 

For example take me, I have quite a few wins under my belt and I don't care for pubs anymore, I use them to warm up for building and my pump accuracy before I play pop up or scrims so I do just steamroll most players but I still have fun.

So to summerise, tryhards are just like any other players, we love the game for what it is the only difference is that we have fun by trying and others have fun by doing the opposite. It's all fine in my book.

The first, happened to join right on time to get the Black Night with me Season 1, with my other friend still feeling a bit salty to this day because they thought the game wasn’t worth it back then.

Grabbed STW during Christmas Day of 2017, and that gave me a similar feeling of upgrading and using weapons like I used to with Ratchet and Clank back in the day! 

I even took the grind to the Omega lights, to then seemingly convince myself I was done back then 💀😆

Now, those same friends have taken a great leap ahead of me as both of them are well past unlocking the Ice King, with myself sitting at Tier 60 on the dot.

There will always be part of the gamer inside of me eating away at the fact that I did not push myself this season, but if I didn’t stop this season then I would never truly stop playing the phenomena called Fortnite Battle Royale.

TL;DR My Complete Status in this game will be coming to an end soon, wanted to say thanks to all of you for the fun adventure it has been! I’m a tad jealous of everyone out there who will have / has Black Knight through Ice King

-circle spawn rate towards the edges of the map decreased

-glider redeploy item taken out of specific LTM’s

-bottle rockets vaulted

- heavy snipers vaulted

-unvault bolt action sniper

-Dynamite vaulted

-small Sheild stack increased back to 10

-slurp stack increased to 3

-final 3 storm circles destroy structures

-decrease spawn rate of heavy ar (I love the heavy ar but I find them way more than anything else)

-thermal and scopes ar vaulted (sorry to those who love them but I used to see more of those on the ground then burst but hey I lost my burst and I’m not the only one that should suffer, lol)

-female tier 100 skin (xp and weekly challenge based unlockable styles, don’t be lazy epic)

-snow biome size decreased (it’s too big and old now)

-huge buff to the scoped revolver

-I’d say vault planes but atm I don’t know how they are with the nerf coming so that is tbdbut most likely vault them

-vault shopping carts

Closing thoughts: so I want all of this because I feel that the weapon variation is too big and so luck based that players who aren’t sweats (me) should have to “hit ur shots kid” or “just build lol” I’m getting burned out atm and I have a passion for this game to strive and be amazing and I understand that planes are associated with challenges so for season 8 lets fix that. Also, even though I hate zip lines they have saved my ass so many times I can’t talk bad about them. Anyways, I just want the game to slowly become more basic, I believe fortnite has strayed too far from what it was and what a majority of the community misses. Thank you for reading!

But I went into a match landed opened 3 chests rotated opened 2 more. How and why am i getting more bottle rockets  than sheilds? this is item is by far one of the most useless items in fortnite. It literally just annoying its not useful at all its weak and pointless? So why add or put it into the game. Please remove it and stop adding these like these.

No one will be mad I promise.,I'm so sick of this stupid item making the flow of the game so horrible. Planes are the most shit addition of all time imo and need to go. Please just get rid of them so I can enjoy playing and not want to move on to another game ,FortNiteBR

Due to a bug found in 7.40 it has to be delayed.  Apparently more information will be available soon. It may still come tommorow, just later, or maybe at the same time. But expect it to be delayed and be happily surprised if it is not. ",FortNiteBR

I see this guy, he drives away behind a tree, wears a bush, I take off the bush, I waste a magazine of a silenced SMG and an AR to destroy a tree, BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN SCRATCH. Then this guy, who was using the new default skin (the frozen ceeday skin,) drives to me, sends me 90 feet in the air, gets out, and pumps me to the head. I should have 1) destroyed that tree, 2) not been sent 30000 feet into the air, 3) Just left the match. This game is actually so bad now. Why do you not listen to the community, even though you're about to be destroyed by Apex?",FortNiteBR

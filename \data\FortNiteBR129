I've practiced a lot and I'm not getting any better.  However I still enjoy playing the game so I have a question for the good players here.

If you're rushing a bot like me, what's the one thing I can do that you don't want to see.

Thus far it seems like the minigun is the best weapon.  If my opponent is close enough it seems like I can pretty frequently shut down a rush by just letting the minigun rip.

Every single time I'm about 10 minutes into a match, my game crashes and I'm met with a pop up window that says Unreal Engine 4 has crashed. I've been having this problem for months and it happens randomly. 

Here's some of what I have tried:
Uninstalling and reinstalling the game. 
Reinstalling Windows 10.
Disabling full screen optimisation.
Making all my video settings low.
Verifying files (about 15 times now). 
Underclocking my gpu. 

Something of interest may be: I tried disabling all microsoft services and then booting and Fortnite wouldn't launch.

AMD Ryzen 3 2200G

I personally feel they should be for mobility only. If you can shoot from it, it doesn't need a built in turret. It should also cause player damage instead of vehicle damage when crashing through structures, too many people see it as a battering ram. 

The zip-lines are still bugged, causing a weird stuttering effect when not leaving one. They also still launch you from them randomly. Using launchpads under them should negate the effect of the zipline. I don't want to be in the final circles and make a push only to be dragged into the storm with a zipline tied to my back.

&amp;#x200B;

Make the ziplines push to interact, like chests, llamas and other forms of mobility.

I have other things ive not been able to put up as images:  
Fortnite mobile has multiple startup screens, I remember there being a startup screen for season 5 with black knight within the image for it.  
Sparkle specialist and her glider being given out as boogie down contest items.  
The return of item shop skins which havent been out since early 2018, most of which have been around or released during season 1, or season 2.  
The ice kingdom theme of season 7, its a longshot but hey, it could be a nod towards season 2 having a medieval theme and also starting in the holidays/winter season.  


Thats all I have, leave your comments and discussion below, personally id love for this stuff to come back, hell ive even resorted to attempting to break TOS to get some of these exclusive s2 items.

Can you help this mom get better at FORTNITE?","First, thank you for everyone who responded to my first post. It was removed because I didn't add flair. I got a lot of really good comments but would love even more.

I am so addicted to this game. But I am so bad at it. I want to learn to get better and am willing to spend time at it.  I'd love some tips!

My daughter is 10 and she's loving the game. I debated getting it, but really, despite the violence it has brought us together. Plus, it is a great motivator. YOU CAN PLAY FORTNITE WHEN YOUR ROOM IS CLEAN! and boom.... Room cleaning happens at lightning speed. 

But I digress. What I need help with is getting better. My video game days were back in the era of Asteroids on Atari and Summer Olympics on the Commodore 64. I was good. But I've never used a console at all. It's so challenging. We are playing on Nintendo Switches. 

I'm at level 20. 8ve got about 20 kills so far. Aiming was so hard. I turned my sensitivity waaaaaay down to about .25 which helped. My goal is to gradually increases that. 

I'm trying to learn to build but I am so slow. Today I played all day and my goal was to learn to build whenever I was getting shot at. It so darn slow. 

Ok. A. Wall. That's R. Another wall. Another wall. Ok now a ramp. What button is that? Oh yeah, ZL. Ok. I built a ramp. But crap....I'm under it. Ok. Edit. Damn. It's not working. I'll just pickaxe my way out. Build a ramp. Jump. I'm on the ramp. 

That took way too long. And someone snuck up on me and I'm dead. 

My daughter makes it to the top 10 regularly by hiding. I don't want to do that. I want to learn to build and get into awesome battles. I know that getting the high ground is key. But if it takes me ages to build a ramp or tower, that's not going to help. 

I figure it will take me months to get good, but would love some tips. 

Here's what I've done so far:

-watched loads of YouTube videos 
-watched whoever killed me
-set goals. For example, I spent an entire day dropping in loot lake and working to quickly get a gun and find someone to kill. That helped a lot. 
-repeatedly landed in places that are populated to practice quick battles.

But I am so bad at it. I want to learn to get better and am willing to spend time at it.  I'd love some tips!

My daughter is 10 and she's loving the game. I debated getting it, but really, despite the violence it has brought us together. Plus, it is a great motivator. YOU CAN PLAY FORTNITE WHEN YOUR ROOM IS CLEAN! and boom.... Room cleaning happens at lightning speed. 

But I digress. What I need help with is getting better. My video game days were back in the era of Asteroids on Atari and Summer Olympics on the Commodore 64. I was good. But I've never used a console at all. It's so challenging. We are playing on Nintendo Switches. 

I'm at level 20. 8ve got about 20 kills so far. Aiming was so hard. I turned my sensitivity waaaaaay down to about .25 which helped. My goal is to gradually increases that. 

I'm trying to learn to build but I am so slow. Today I played all day and my goal was to learn to build whenever I was getting shot at. It so darn slow. 

Ok. A. Wall. That's R. Another wall. Another wall. Ok now a ramp. What button is that? Oh yeah, ZL. Ok. I built a ramp. But crap....I'm under it. Ok. Edit. Damn. It's not working. I'll just pickaxe my way out. Build a ramp. Jump. I'm on the ramp. 

That took way too long. And someone snuck up on me and I'm dead. 

My daughter makes it to the top 10 regularly by hiding. I don't want to do that. I want to learn to build and get into awesome battles. I know that getting the high ground is key. But if it takes me ages to build a ramp or tower, that's not going to help. 

I figure it will take me months to get good, but would love some tips. 

Here's what I've done so far:

-watched loads of YouTube videos 
-watched whoever killed me
-set goals. For example, I spent an entire day dropping in loot lake and working to quickly get a gun and find someone to kill. That helped a lot. 
-repeatedly landed in places that are populated to practice quick battles. 
-did cre a tive mode learn how to get faster at building ramps and towers.

You come in teams of 4 but play in public solo matches and your scores are combined.
5 points per kill, 20 points for a victory Royale.
After each player has played one game, the top 5 groups of 4 have all of their players play one more game to determine the top 2 teams.
Controller only

Anyone that‚Äôs played in a similar tourney, do you have any advice? Is it better to hot drop or go for a win.

* Being able to passively move through ceilings. Like when I build one overhead to prevent someone dropping in and they drop right through it, or more annoyingly, placing a floor down when building up to place a launch pad and falling right through!

* Not being able to edit my own walls.

* Using a floor to go down the side of a mountain but it places itself one square over, resulting in fall damage.

* On the same note as the previous bullet point, placing a wall between you and an enemy but it places the wall one square away instead - trapping you in the same area with the opponent.

* Zip lines randomly throwing you off.

* Shots hitting but no damage registering.

* Shots not hitting but damage registering! For example, when you see a sniper round fly over your head and then a half second later you die.

* Randomly being thrown to the other side of the map when building. Not sure what triggers this one, but always results in a death.

* The ""free-fall"" animation being stuck, so you end up fighting someone who zips around with faster movement than normal and they're also harder to hit because they're horizontal rather than vertical.

There are many more, but these are the ones that are really bothering me at the moment.

My wife, myself, and the 13yr old were eliminated early in the match but watched (never returned to the lobby) the 17yr old continue on and support him.

With our combined guidance and advice, he prevailed against all odds, including fighting with no shields throughout the entire match, and achieved our first victory Royale.

This was the first time we got a victory royale as a squad and I want to thank Epic for allowing my wife and I to have a bonding moment with our foster kids.",FortNiteBR

There are many problems with Fortnite on the switch, I know it‚Äôs not a hardware problem because most of these problems didn‚Äôt exist when it first came out for the switch.

- Frame rate is horrible, sometimes even in solos. Duos and Squads are basically unplayable because of how horrible it is.

- Music randomly cuts out, lobby music, battle bus music and emotes.

- In game the textures look fine, but a lot of the time in the lobby they make it look like a potato that went swimming in acid. It looks horrible.

- We don‚Äôt have a career tab, (I know this is also a problem for mobile) but I know they‚Äôre tracking our stats because at the start of season 6 it showed us how many wins we got, and our kills.

- 80% of the people in game are just Ramirez. I know it isn‚Äôt just a coincidence because it happens every game, and most the time they have the omega pickaxe or some obviously non default axe/backbling.

- We get paired with xbox and playstation players, which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem if we didn‚Äôt have frame rate issues and had different controllers. The controllers for the switch are not made for shooter games, making it much harder to aim. We used to be paired with only switch players, but they decided to change it.

Epic, I know you all have worked hard on this game but please make it playable for us switch players.",FortNiteBR

128,julianmarket,1546114154,aaohsm,29,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aaohsm/1_year_ago_today/,1,"1 year ago, today.","I started to play Fortnite. I launched it for the first time and was pretty excited for a free battle royale game. All my friends have been playing and had to see for myself what this game was all about. I launch ""Battle Royale"" and was taken to the lobby to see a Christmas themed background. Immediately, I was obsessed. I look at the store and find that there were  Christmas outfits (which I would've bought, but did not know the game would blow up). I call my dad over to watch me play my first game, hoping that he would like the game and play with me.  

I ready up my first solo and was taken to the starting island. There, I was able to learn the controls and got the hang of it quickly. I was soon taken to the Battle Bus, which at the time was red with Santa Claus as the balloon. I drop, not knowing where to land so I landed at the crates. There I was with atleast 10 other people not knowing what to do. I had found an SMG, but soon demolished by a Gingerbread Man. I had a sort of rush of excitement. I was in love with the game and so was my dad.

My dad and I weren't close, and that changed after I introduced my dad to Fortnite. We ran up duos all the time and we would have a blast playing together. I still even remember our first recorded win like it was last night. 

As we improved and got to know the game a little better, my dad decided to buy the Battle Pass for Season 2 with atleast 25-30 days left. And I went ahead and bought it as well. We wanted the Black Knight pretty badly and we thought we weren't going to get it. But with lots and lots of grinding, my dad and I eventually reached the Tier 70 Black Knight. And to this day we think it is our greatest accomplishment together. 

After a while, we got drained at about the middle of Season 5. Fortnite was not as fun as it used to be. It was finally dying on me and it was on my father as well. I stopped playing and didn't even reach Tier 100 Ragnarok. 

I now want to say my final goodbye to Fortnite. I thank you for the fun times with my friends at 3 in the morning and especially for making my dad and I closer. I intend to play every once in a while just for the heck of it.

Goodbye and thank you Fortnite and Epic Games. For everything.

There hasn't been much clarification about the exclusivity of the Galaxy Skin promotion, only that it ends in the near future (12/31/18). Recently it was datamined that there was a Galaxy weapon skin in the game files, meaning that the set would be receiving this new addition to it, being the previous the backbling, the pickaxe and the glider.

Also recently EPIC Games has started selling items in bundles, like Wukong for example. This could mean that with the addition of the weapon skins EPIC is preparing to sell this bundle in the shop since their obligation with Samsung to keep it exclusive for the promotion will end in this year.

Basing on this information I could be wrong and the Galaxy set is exclusive to Samsung Galaxy promotion owners with no exception, but there's also a big chance that EPIC will be selling this in 2019.

Again, this is my theory, but I'm betting it'll return. EPIC wouldn't want to miss this huge hype and turn it into cash.",FortNiteBR

(Very long),"Yo, I have been playing since the end of season 2 and this game has been a experience, but this game has changed a lot and I need to discuss what I think can be fixed and what's wrong.

Atmosphere: if you were to show this game to someone in season 1 they would have been like ""This looks sweet, I'll check it out. What's it called, fortnite?"" But in season 7, they wouldn't like the game really at all.

Vaulted Items: 
Zapotron - Revisited this Item.
Old Smg - Replace it and vault the smg 
Smoke Grenades - in selected ltms 
Crossbow - Holiday Weapon
Revolver - Replace with Six shooter.
Tac SMG - Replace it and vault compact
Suppressed SMG - Unvault and make Epic and legendary along with the Tac
Bouncers - Bring them back lol
Impulse - Bring back in selected ltms 
Shockwave - bring them back lol
LMG - Bring it back
Drum Gun - bring it back Epic and Legendary supply drops only.
Double Barrel - I dont know? Unvault it I guess.
Clingers - bring them back 

That's all the vaulted that should be checked at least

What to vault

Standard SMG - Accuracy is op when jumping and it replace the tac

Compact SMG - Way overpowered and the sound sucks

Turrent - Useless and Formerly overpowered but again useless

Planes - WAY OVERPOWERED 

Six Shooter - Horrible Accuracy.

AK - (VAULTED IN SOLOS AND SQUADS ONLY)  Though Good, I feel like it shouldn't be in those modes.

Burst - Horrible Bloom.



MAP 

Lets Replace Paradise With Moisty because Paradise is to small and compacted to handle the amount of players that are there. Bring back Original Tomato, Castle Ruins. Expand Haunted a bit south, and Give snobby more houses.

Next season's story? I feel like it should be about time travel. So we get the season 3 map with the meteor and we have to destroy so it doesn't hit the map. We also get the S2 and S3 Battle pass combined to get a 170 Tier Battle Pass with the Season 2 Format.

Features and Options.

Can we get rid of the buy tier option until the person has at least reached a certain amount of XP or a Tier and the Battle Pass? Refunds should be infinite (because who's going to abuse that much) and you can refund purchases from any day and season. 

Season shop return. 

That's right, I want the season shop to return along with the battle pass. Not because if Renegade Or Aerial Assault, because it gives people who maybe already complete the battle pass a bonus.(If they unlocked all items but the season ends. They have a 1 week last chance to but them.

That's all I'm suggesting right now. Hope everyone has a good day!

Even if you were shot down you could glide with no damage done and it would still be balanced. Adding the boost and turret is just overkill. Third partying people with a plane and sending them flying off their builds just shouldn‚Äôt happen. The game is damn near ruined because of the overpowered planes and surely epic understands that.

#This weeks topic is: **Vaulted Items**

* If any items were to return, what adjustments should be made?
* Is the use of vaulting items better and more valuable for the game in the future?
* Would adjusting the items flaws and mechanics be a better option than vaulting the item?
* Is the vault making the game more balanced in terms of item drop rate and gameplay?

I was around a 3.5kd with about 600 wins so I consider myself somewhat decent with a lot of room for improvement. I've always had a good pc but I always played on xbox because that's what my friends played on but about 5 days ago I made the switch to keyboard and mouse on pc and it's a lot harder and more frustrating than I expected. I was just hoping for some tips on improving faster and getting better overall without going through the struggle of feeling like a bot in every game I play because that's currently how it is. Should I just work on my building and aiming while avoiding actual matches early or play them as much as I can. If anybody else has made the switch I'd like to know how long and how hard it was to become somewhat decent. I have game knowledge and awareness from how long I've been playing I just lack good mechanics. I know I can get good on Kb&amp;m and I know it's gonna take some time but I was just hoping for any tips anybody has for just starting out. Thanks in advance.,FortNiteBR

Where all RNG gaps are eliminated, New items are put trough casual before entering Ranked, Skilled players are rewarded (skins, v-bucks, etc), and a nice series of ranks to grind up of.

so basically they didn't say it is cheating. Judging by their answer, I think only modifications to the games code would be cheating.

I propose that they should also be usable usable as a one time mini turret add-on for vehicles, with the possible exception of the plane, to make them not only more usable weapons and worth picking up but also to make things like quadcrashers and golf carts less obsolete as a mode of transport whilst playing with friends.

421,adriansurette,1546041287,aafuju,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aafuju/michael_jackson_reference/,1,Michael Jackson Reference,"As most have probably noticed, Epic Games loves to reference pop culture in their dances, songs and characters. I will also add that I enjoy the references because they spice things up and add some relevance! That being said I noticed a possible huge reference that I can't find any posts about, so decided to see if anybody else is with me!

While going through my skins I scrolled past The Moonwalker and thought ""Jeez I have never liked this skin, I don't even know if I have ever used it!"". I always thought it was super plain and boring and didn't really care for the colors, plus it's one of the brightest and whitest skins so not very tactical either.  Me being the type of person that I am, started analyzing the skin to find out exactly why I didn't like it so much and searching for some cool aspect I may have missed.

&amp;#x200B;

I zoom in completely on the face which I thought was one of the regular faces of the girl with the black ponytail, but quickly notice something seems... different. On her cheeks there are these shadows that give a slightly more sharp and angular look to the face, looking similar to MJ's prominent cheek bones. No big deal, everybody has a different shape to their face right?

&amp;#x200B;

Next I notice the sunglasses. FortNite does have a couple characters with these accessories, but I can't help but notice a strong resemblance to Michael Jackson's iconic silver aviators. The style of bangs with her hair, aviators and face being closed in by the helmet all come together to look a little bit like the well known image of MJ with his sunglasses and black hat, with some hair falling to a side of the face. 

&amp;#x200B;

The icing on what is a cake of assumptions and speculations that I have baked here; The Moonwalker.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean at this point do I even need to explain myself? lol... This could all just be a coincidence. This could ALSO be Epic realizing the opportunity to make a reference to one of the biggest pop culture influences ever by using their space themed Season 3 linked with ""Moonwalking""! 

&amp;#x200B;

Agree or not, everybody sees things differently and in the end everything in life is nothing but our interpretation of it! I'm going to continue thinking that it's Michael, and i'm going to continue not using the skin! Enjoy!

I've been a gaming fan for over 10 years now, especially in esports and the overall evolution of the gaming industry. Watching the growth of Fortnite has been nothing short of incredible. While in no way is Fortnite perfect, the tournament prize money, twitch viewership, and media outreach is years before its time.  It's a damn great time to be a gamer and I think it'll only continue to improve.That being said, the only way this game can continue to thrive is through the support of this community.

The communities reaction to Ninja's WIRED video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmKhO_RCd0Uis) is a slap in the face to the gaming community as a whole. This video having 145k dislikes at the time of writing is sad and to be truthfully honest disgusting. I'm not here to defend Ninja. But we have a gamer and TWITCH STREAMER, I REPEAT A TWITCH STREAMER on a segment that usually features the most famous movie stars and music artists.

While most people disliked this video to troll or hurt Ninja's brand, but his brand is already well established and the trolling is already obvious to the entire community. The only thing these dislikes are doing successfully is telling media sources and other companies is that you don't want to content on GAMERS. Ninja will still have his media appearances and publicity, the community will just ruin every other streamers chance to have these same opportunities. You won't see a WIRED video with Tfue, Tim, Daequan or any other streamer you support and want to see succeed. 

What I consider to be the most successful game/esport/gaming community is League of Legends. Having been around for over 9 years, having the most viewed esports events, and being one of the first games to break into the mass media is just a few of its successes. The reason the league of legends community has thrived for so long is due to the unwaivering support of its fans. The fans are able to put aside their personal agendas and opinions and look at ANY content objectively to say ""Wow, this is awesome for the game"" ""Dan Gilbert and the Houston Rockets invested in league, this is huge for Esports"". Fans cared about not only the game, but the success of the gaming industry as a whole. 

I want to see Fornite, Streamers, this community, and gaming thrive for a very long time. In order for that to be possible is through the community supporting EVERYONE. Please put your personal opinions aside and be happy for this community/gaming as a whole, because when one person eats we all eat.

I've seen a lot of hype in the comments about Ground Game and how it should get implemented into the game, its a nostalgic game mode; Ground Game delivers about as close as we'll get to those old days and I had a great time playing yesterday. I believe that it should be reworked and renamed to appeal to the players who miss it. I will propose certain limitations and suggestions below, and I would love if the community discussed it, as I believe that the player count is large enough to support Solo and at least a rotation of Duos/Squads.

**Materials:** I think it should cap out at 100, with a 50/30/20 allocation. 70 was nice for the LTM, but 100 would give enough to construct a small structure or defense to withstand explosives. I love the idea of using natural cover and terrain to your advantage, coming from PUBG, getting the zone and height on your opponent can sway the outcome of the match.

**Ammo:** When I learnt they added limited ammo I got really excited and expected MUCH lower caps on the ammo. In the menu screen it even addressed how you should conserve ammo and pick your shots carefully, I'm expecting barebones, barely enough ammo for a mag, but what we got was rocket spamming, enough small ammo for a minigun to tear through the 70 materials you are provided, and more. Basically the amount of ammo provided was too high and lowering it can dramatically improve immersion in this mode. 

**My take:**

* 45 Medium
* 10 Heavy
* 60 Light
* 9 Shells 
* 2 Rockets (if in but ideally no explosives)

This, with the limited materials could've made for a much more engaging mode. You wouldn't have to worry about running out of ammo if you scavenge piles of loot, grab ammo boxes, or play aggressively. Rockets shouldn't have even been added into this mode, I would support throwable explosives only but egg launcher and RPGs are too much.

**General suggestions:**

* Some items that are vaulted should be added back into this mode such as the port-a-fort whilst also removing the port-a-fortress.
* Vault planes and turret, potentially remove all forms of quick navigation incl. rifts
* Vault Balloons
* Airdrops should be a source of most purple+ items, whilst also adjusting chest spawns and the rarities, also disallowing green+ ground drops to prevent everyone in the endgame having amazing loot.

**Conclusion:**

With the recent addition of mass customization and the ability to adjust the contents of chests and whatnot, I believe if Epic really put time into this mode, they could recreate that Season 1 itch everyone seems to have nowadays. The player count wouldn't be separated too much, and it might be the go-to gamemode for  Fortnite players who love the game AND the building but would like a mode with less of an emphasis on building. If anyone has suggestions I'd love to open the conversation as my last post got no traction at all! ",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Background if it helps:

My voice chat worked in season 5, but S6 it never did. For S7 it worked for about a week and then stopped. I have a feeling Discord did something to mess it up because it stopped working in S7 the same day I opened up discord for a different game. At the beginning of S7 Discord was closed. I have since uninstalled Discord, restarted my computer, did all the 'default communication device' tricks but to no avail. I just use Discord in browser now.

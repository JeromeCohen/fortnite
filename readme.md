# Understanding Fortnite's Reddit Community 
After subscribing to both r/FortNiteBR and r/FortniteCompetitive for a better part of a year, I wanted to explore quantifying the differences I and many other subreddit members noticed. This repo covers the entire lifecycle of the data project including gathering, cleaning, and modeling the data. The repo also include the source for a [React app](http://jeromecohen.github.io/fortnite) that presents Latent Dirichlet Allocation visualizations depeneding on the subreddit and Fortnite patch the user specifies. 

# Future Exploration
The next step for this project is to analyze the sentiment of user's posts in both subreddits over time. As I used to be a casual player, I expect to see certain dips and spikes as a result of controversial or well-received patches. The casual and competitive communities also respond differently to patches. I've already seen this phenomenon from the topic models and expect it to continue with sentiment. Finally, I plan on calculating and graphing a handful of key metrics for each subreddit such as number of posts per day, top contributors, average sentiment per day, polarity per day

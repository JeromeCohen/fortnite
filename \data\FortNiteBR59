But that doesn’t change the fact that people sometimes want to play casually and be rewarded for kills and not have to farm 50% of the time. Hopefully EPIC listens to the backlash and does something.

Being guaranteed instant recovery after a fight in the form of health and mats makes it considerably less risky to engage in combat.  This fundamentally breaks the risk/reward balance thats key to Battle Royale.

A huge draw of battle royale for me is risk analysis.  ""That guy is really vulnerable, but if I kill him, I'll be just as vulnerable.  Is his loot worth it?""  ""That team is a sitting duck, but theres probably more teams around too, will we be able to recover if we attack them?"" ""That high ground is valuable, but can I defend it from 2 or three teams?""

Those moments and the need for quick decision making are why I play.  Sometimes I've got poor loot, so I need to risk the fight in order to get better gear, otherwise I'll be totally outgunned in the endgame.  Other times, my gear is fine, and I'm better off playing it safe.  I like that the answer isn't always ""Fight that guy.""

Recently, I didn't think at all about risk analysis.  Regardless of my situation, It was always worth it to get into a fight.  When I'm not thinking about surviving and just looking for my next fight, it feels more like TDM than BR.

These changes we're not about making it better or worse for one group of players.  Epic saw that the way people played was fundamentally different than what they envision for their game and decided to make a change.

Please though, give us the mat adjustments back.  Those were perfect.",FortNiteBR

\-Not enough loot in houses.

\-Balloons dont belong

\-Turtling is too overpowered

\-Ballers need to be removed. they are cool but dont belong in competitive. it encourages way to passive of gameplay

\- To many of the same guns spawning right beside each other.

\- BIGGEST ISSUE IN FORTNITE COMPETITIVE : - GUN QUALITIES.\*GOLD \* PURPLE \* BLUE \* GREEN \* GREY NEEDS TO BE REMOVED from competitive. ;

Reason being is I drop I get a grey tact shotgun, I hit the guy 6 times, he hits me twice and wins. What do I learn?

I should have ran and got better loot. But I heard him shoot a tac and I assumed he had a grey one too..

Its just messed up. lets say I had a pistol and he had a tac, im already at a disadvantage. now you wanna give him a BLUE tac and me a GREY pistol? x10 disadvantage. its not right and its not fair for competitive.

Competitive Fortnite needs a game mode called FAIR GAME as the competitive mode. where there is LESS RNG.

Less chance people can find minis and 50 shields and make it about eliminations so you DESERVE the shield.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not chill when me and my opponent drop at L's at tilted and his L gives him Blue Tac and minis and mine gives me balloons and a grey tac. &lt; Example. I dont even get a chance to run for better loot. &gt; this needs to be addressed as a main issue and could easily be fixed.

: HOW TO FIX GUN VARIANTS :  Decide on a colour either purple blue or green and make all guns same colour in competitive, OR Change the outside picture to a colour of there choice and make all weapons nerfed to be damage inbetween green and blue or inbetween blue and purple. BOOM. Now the only RNG is if he got a different weapon type. not weapon and rarity. Rarities dont belong in competitive. period.",FortNiteBR

When I woke up yesterday and watched TheCampingRusher's vid on the patch notes, I was mortified. I couldn't believe what I was reading. These changes had made the last few weeks of fortnite so much fun. I was retty pissed. the poison traps suck, and overall I didn't like the update. I got on at 10, and the first thing I did when I got on was play arena, so I could still play with the siphon and boosted mats. After a little bit, I decided to try out pubs. and I actually had fun.

Here's the thing. A huge complaint within the community is that since that last update, solo and duo pubs had become way too sweaty. But when I went into pub lobbies yesterday, everybody was a bot. I ran into only a few other sweats beside myself. I think this really was the update that fortnite needed. All the sweats and pros can play in Arena, and the casual players now have their regular modes. While I do think they should put the mat boost back in pubs, overall the siphon change is good. So after the initial shock, this change is better for fortnite in the long term.

They introduce this new mode that sorts people based off skill levels, but they need people of higher skill levels to actually *get there*, otherwise the skill levels won't be paced properly.


I personally find the base game quite fun ATM. Maybe I'm just getting lucky, but I haven't seen a tryhard once in the Lava LTM, nor in solos. Now I'm just losing because I suck! As it should be! Building is less of a central pillar of the game due to the reduction of farming (which I should mention I do NOT approve of, but I will deal with FTTB). 

Now we just need some more stability patches. How about that for a bit? No new guns items or traps, just balance tweeks, QOL changes, and stability attuning? I know people beg for this every day, but hopefully we can get Epic to listen to us now that everyone's so pissed off! 


Edit: Reup because post flair guidelines.

I usually rock around a 2.5 kd and 18-22% winrate from season to season.  I took a small break end of season 7 and came back basically because of the siphon.  I was sick of all of my fights being decided by who actually found shields that game and siphon literally fixed that problem and made all games seem win able and fair even with bad luck on loot.  

Jump to this patch.  They take the siphon out and made harvesting take forever (not sure why those two things even needed to be connected). 
Anyway I played some arena mode yesterday and did okay for the first bit.  It felt weird without a bus fare though because everyone was just pushing everything with no regard to any strategy because there was no consequence for dying.  Got some wins and some kills and ended up around 100 points last night.  I got to a point where I was sweating my ass off and could not get a kill. I started looking up players stats that killed me and that died in my games and every single one of them was a PC player.  

Look I’m fine with competition but this just doesn’t feel like a fair fight.  Their frames are way higher than mine so all of their movements felt way more fluid and instant.  Add to that all of them were probably using stretched res with a much better FOV and let’s face it it’s way easier to aim with stretched plus M&amp;KB.  

So coming back to the title.  I feel like there isn’t a mode that I can even play right now.  I can do the completely luck based farming simulator of regulars or play against people who have insane advantages over me that I’d have to spend a lot of money on a PC to even start to compete with.  I only make this post not just for myself but I think that a lot of other people are around my skill level and on console who probably feel the same way and would love to hear your thoughts about it.

I've been playing fortnite for a year now and yesterday got my PC so i can start playing on keyboard and mouse. I was curious if anyone knows any good YouTube videos to use to get started on keybinds and mouse sensitivity. I had 100+ duo wins, 28 solo wins on PS4 and was getting pretty comfortable playing and hot dropping. I could ramp wall floor and 90 pretty quick.

Now I want to switch to keyboard and mouse to try and get better and have more fun playing. The problem is I don't really know where to start when I comes to mouse sensitivity and keybinds. 

I know people will say do what is comfortable for you.. but I have never played any game ever on PC. So I'm kind of in the dark of what comfortable means. 

Like I know it's going to be hard... even told myself it will probably take a year or more before I can do all the same things I used to do on controller. 

It's just I want to make sure I'm practicing something that realistic if that makes sense. 

Now I have harvest tool and weapon slots 1-6 and Q is wall E is floor and C is roof. And I have a mouse button for my stairs. 

Maybe if someone knows YouTube videos about form for clicking keys.. like i wanna make sure I'm developing habits that have  the correct fingers clicking the correct buttons if that makes sense..

And my concern on sensivity is just bc when I first downloaded fortnite on pC and used default sensitivity it was like way to high.. and I needed to turn it like All the way down... so I wasn't sure if it was just me not being able to handle the high sense and I just needed to practice more or if that sensitivity is actually unrealistic and no one would use it. 

I can change my mouse DPI and stuff but I'm not even 100% what that does or means.

Like do people use scroll up and scroll down for stuff? I don't know.. I just have alot of questions and was having  a hard time finding a YouTube video that helps with the absolute basics of setting  up sense and keybinds. So if anyone can help me out that would be great if not it's all good! Thanks everyone!",FortNiteBR

1- having bad updates and a prime reason is removing health per kill and materials being back to 999 and no more 50 of every material after you kill sb this is the worst change so far and the dumbest idea by an epic employee 



2- you might not agree but the biggest reason is we still havent got middle eastern servers now i wouldnt really mind having another server but having a bad server with 120 ping minimum isnt the thing you will enjoy like if you shoot someone sometimes it wouldnt do any damage ( without him building ) and im sure people who quit fortnite will go to more than likely apex or any other game because fortnite servers are the worst servers i have ever tried in my gaming life and most of my friends have quitted fortnite because of the bad ping

3- giving noobs an unfair advantage :

Well imagine you went on youtube and saw a new game and you liked it and you go to download it and hopping into your first game you run in a sweat and deletes you and this happens every game because your new and dont know how to build or aim because your new then after a few games you will start to hate the game and probably delete is ( best option ) 


4-Removing aim assist : 



Well im gonna use removing but not nerfing it because there is littarly no aim assist i tried turning off aim assist and it still the same my aim didnt get bad or die and the aim is so hard on controller and PC players have advantage when you want to play with your PC friend 


5- listening to the TTV kids  

What i mean by listening to ttv kids is ignoring the community and changing  what ever the streamers want.

Most streamers are the biggest reason why fortnite is dying and it isnt that fun as season 3 for example and a prime example of this is Ninja (no hate on him) and if you saw one of his clips he was complaining about having aim assist for console players and most
Ttv kids after every time they die by a weapon they be like : epic you need to nerf this .. or epic remove this .. epic add this

This post is about the many recent concerns about competitive matchmaking on console with regards to pc players. Let me start off by saying I am not a competitive player, yes I want to be better and yes I enjoy playing the game but I really don’t free enjoy competitive because I’m simply not that good. The changes to casual modes hurt at first but I think there’s a chance that it is for the better and I do understand why it was done. I have no problem playing competitive to get back those benefits we once had in casual. But please for the love of everything holy let us console players only play with each other. I know there have been other posts but they haven’t gotten as much traction as I’m hoping this will. I will go into a bit more details in a bit but I just want to restate that please if you agree show it!Epic seem to respond to posts that garner lots of attention!!

DISCLAIMER: I’m aware that this got very long but I encourage you to read it all the way through I put a decent amount of work into it and I think I make some valid points. 


Reason 1 - Stretch Res:

Clearly there are many things that give PC players the advantage over console such as custom resolutions. Stretch res is almost universally considered to be a large advantage over anyone on native as seen by almost all major streamers now switching to stretch such as tfue and many other competitive players. This is impossible for console players to achieve so even at a 100% even skill level the PC player has the advantage in that respect which is completely unfair to the console player. Also these custom resolutions can result in a higher frame rate in the end game especially which is a disadvantage to a console player who is stuck at the same frames no matter what which are often too low already. 

Reason 2 - Custom Graphics: 

Similar to how they can control their res, PC players can obviously control their graphical settings such as shadows and motion blur. These are also widely accepted as an advantage that when done increase your skill. So to again have something that would increase PC players skill that a console player could not do is just not a fair competitively. 

Reason 3 - Aim:

Obviously PC players have better aim and a lot more stability due to the use of their whole arm when aiming. Obviously epic has tried to combat this with things such as aim assist but even with that it’s just not the same. 

There are im sure more little reasons that I’m even unaware of but I wanted to just do an overview of a few of the major reasons that it is unfair to pair these player groups. I now want to address some criticisms and concerns.

Criticisms and Concerns:

Concern - If this ranked mode was split then how would tournaments such as qualifications be impacted?

Possible solution - I think the best possible solution would be to have a ranked mode where pc and console are mixed and one that is purely for console. If you chose to play in just the console one you wouldn’t be able to qualify for tournaments you would just be playing it to enjoy playing other console players at your skill level. Then if you feel like that’s too easy or that you want to qualify for tournaments you join the other playlist which would be the same as the one we have currently. 

Possible solution - this one would be less ideal but if epic would be totally against this due to something such as server stress of having two separate playlists that are basically the same or something like that (I don’t claim to understand how it works but I see it as something that could be a concern). Then I would ask that console just have a console only playlist and that perhaps only the top few, a more selective few, would be able to qualify for the events and tournaments from this ranked mode. If players on controller wanted better odds they could do as many other competitive console players (gronky, nickmercs, etc) have done and go play controller on pc. But this would obviously be tough because not everyone can afford an expensive super PC. But I think that giving a few less spots for the console only comp playlist for qualifications would also work. 

Criticism - if you think console is at such a disadvantage then go play on PC.

Response - while that is great in theory, not everyone can afford a PC and some people prefer to play with their friends on console who may also not want to play PC.


I would love to hear feedback or constructive criticism from anyone who wants to discuss in the comments and again I can’t stress enough how important it is to show you agree if you do. Thanks for taking the time to read this. 


TL;DR: I think that give the numerous advantages PC players have that even players of same skill level on different devices are not equal. I think a decent solution would be for console to have two ranked playlists, one for only console players that doesn’t count for qualifications, and one that’s mixed that does count for qualifications. 
 

Edit from first post - removed part about learning new style, any player that switched to Pc would likely stay on controller. ",FortNiteBR

This adds up to 320 battle stars, or 32 tiers.

Given your current level of 37, you have received 7*5 battle stars for multiples of five levels and 30*2 battle stars for all other levels. If you add this up, you get 95 battle stars, or 9.5 tiers.

1.Epic almost always listens to their community. I haven't seen a single person that was upset with the addition of the 50 health/shiled and mats per kill and happy with the removal so it makes no sence for Epic to just randomly say ""oh yeah it has resulted in an unhealthy level of aggressive play, diminishing other viable strategies "" and just revert it. I mean people still stay in 1by1's the whole game. The only downside was that when someone got knocked, the other player instantly killed him for the shield so he can continue the fight more healthy. I don't think thats enough for Epic to remove  something that everyone likes.  


2.The leaked(not really, Epic kind of teased it themselves) respwan van I think is the key to all of this. Who would need a respawn van if everyone plays passive, farms and sits in his box the whole game. Furthermore with the no health/shiled/mats per kill if you knock someone you just leave him since you don't really get rewarded for finishing him instantly and it might even get you killed if you decide to do so. So whats the point of the van anyways if no one gets thirsted and instantly finished? Who are you reviving when people would rather just knock a player and and then hunt the other guy and it results in to 2 different scenarios: you either win the fight and res your teammate, or you both get killed so no one gets the opportunity to respawn his teammate.  


With that being said, this lets me to believe that the patch is an April Fools joke(or atleast the health/shield/mats per kill) and on the 1st of April Epic will revet it and release the respawn vans so they can counter the aggressive playstyle that comes with it. Lets be honest I think Epic are capeable of doing something like that. I might be on to something or I can be terribly wrong, but hey ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",FortNiteBR

Hopefully I don't get down voted or ignored or even get my post deleted by the mods, by the fact that I play on Switch.

Epic Games; I have some concerns about the state of Fortnite on Switch and the Mobile community. I don't think that being on the same subreddit is  the best way to check issues, bugs or media, here's the reason:

* Talking  about the subreddit: Our posts rarely are even noticed by you; these  are the posts that contain a lot of bugs, issues and requests from us.  (Epic)
* Talking about the gameplay: We also want to play and have fun on the Arena mode, but it is nearly impossible to do so.

1. The graphics take a lot to load.
2. The frame drops and stability are abysmal.
3. The sound is just ugh (plus, the music stopping suddenly bug is back, this happens in lobby or in game by playing some emotes).

Personally,  I enjoyed playing the 7.40 settings on default playlists, even more on  squad, but now that it is gone, I'm forced to play with some guys that  have 120fps or even higher graphic settings, that's a disadvantage for  us Mobile and Switch players. The game was so fuuuun!!! It feels like a  total different game rn:(

I hope you  guys @ Epic can recognize these issues and help us. Idk if the update  that has been talked about for so loooong (regarding Switch issues) is  coming soon, I'm just sad and have no interest in playing like I used  to:(

Here's an example of how bad the  textures take to load on Switch (idk 'bout you guys on PC, Console or Mobile, if you  also run into issues, please post it below! So epic can see this)

To be honest, I didn’t like it, I felt that it was too much of a variable in gun fights since it’s not uncommon for a fight to turn into a threesome and someone sneaks an extra 50 health out of it. So I came up with an alternative:

Instead of having 50 health/shield instantly granted upon kill, make it regenerative, like Slurp Juice. This way it won’t be as much of a variable in fights and be a bit more balanced than instantly gaining half health back from fights. Also, another idea that I saw from another post was the amount of health/shield you get from killing a knocked player should correlate to the amount of blood that they had left before they died, so if they were just downed, you would get little to no bonus, but if you let them bleed out fully or kill their teammate(s), then you get the full 50.",FortNiteBR

As a casual I didn’t dominate, but most importantly I didn’t get steam rolled every match. The whole point of this update was to move competitive players to a different playlist (which this sub fully supported up until now...)

This sub needs to stop being toxic. There have been many discussions and arguments leading us to see that there are 2 distinct ways to play the game. Casually and competitively. Casuals enjoy crazy items and planes and don’t want to have a sweaty build/edit fest in every engagement. There is nothing wrong with either playstyle though. What is wrong is pushing your playstyle on others. We finally have the separation we have needed, and have promise in game style updates being separated out. Let’s not force epic to revert changes that are great for this game. It’s silly because we have the ranked style still with the extra health and building. It’s not gone, just somewhere else. If we need updates to arena then let’s keep suggestions focused there. It seems like we are pushing for putting arena settings in pubs which is not the right direction. Pubs is no longer meant for the competitive playstyle that the majority of this sub pushes. But there are many more casual players that won’t browse this sub that want it this way 

So play arena if you like that play style or play pubs if you don’t. Simple as that. If we make them the same then what is the point of having them. Comp players will just play pubs again and steam roll until casuals continue quitting the game. ",FortNiteBR

Yes, we asked for ranked because it was desperately needed. Ranked was NEEDED because the pros wanted some place to play competitively all the time, instead of in time limited pop up cups. It was also wanted because casuals wanted less “sweats” in there games and more options for people who might get tired of killing “bots.” 

Shield/health and mats on kill are NEEDED in the public games. It makes every game mode SO BORING because, since they also decreased farm rate back to the old rate, you have to farm for the majority of the match to get back to the old mat cap that was brought back, 999.  It isn’t nearly as bad as normal squads though. Since all 4 players need mats and health, this makes it where no one has anything because everyone is trying to get stuff for themselves. It is boring and unnecessary and NEEDS to be reverted. 

Finally, to the people who say, “Just play ranked because they have those mechanics and stop complaining.” Guess what, not everyone wants to play ranked. Not everyone plays 12 hours a day in scrims and knows how to deal with competitive players. That is what pubs are for; the non comp players. And as a competitive player who ALSO plays pubs, these mechanics are needed in public matches. 

Epic Games, PLEASE revert the changes made in path 8.20. It ruins the non competitive side of the game (which let me say that casuals MAKE UP MOST OF THE PLAYER BASE) and should be changed.

If you think about it, this change will force competitive players to play the arena game mode (where siphon is existent). If aggressive players want to be rewarded with health and mats per kill, they will play the arena mode — which is what Epic wants them to do.
Playing arena is basically playing sbmm mode. Playing pubs is not attractive right now, but many lesser skilled players may opt for it compared to the sweat-fest that arena ensues.
If epic did not remove the siphon from the normal game modes, less people would try playing arena. 
That’s why they removed it, to urge sweatier players to play arena and leave bots in pubs .

     I found a picture from u/RuffianSFM of Eon without Her helmet, and I loved the idea of having Eon able to remove the helmet, so naturally I thought... 

“The other two would look nice without a helmet as well, so why not?”

     This will probably never get viewed by any epic employe because I have a small acount, but still I dont think an addition like this would do any harm, I even drew a picture a while back of what id expect Oblivion to look like unmasked, check it out if you so chose. 

     But in conclusion, I think this would be an amazing addition to the current roster of “un-maskable’s” (yes I did just come up with that title).

We all know that a ranked mode has been requested for a while now. Arena mode seems to be the first step towards a ranked mode, yet it still needs improvement. From what I can tell, you are ranked with people that have a similar amount of “hype” as you. This is a bandaid solution. Here’s why: A competitive player is matched in the same match as a casual player because they have a similar hype level. The competitive player just started playing, so their hype is likely 0, and they will therefore be ranked with people with a hype of 0. 
The problem: people with a 0.5 kd, like myself, are playing against competitive players. Usually when I am killed, I like to look at the player’s stats. It sucks to see that I was fighting against someone with a 10+ kd whom I have no chance of beating. That is the root of the problem. Casual players like myself have no chance, no way win when playing against people that are miles better. 

My proposed solution: Rank players against other players with a similar kd for the last 10 matches. That way, they are playing against people who clearly have a similar skill level. 

Side note: this sub is really toxic right now. Epic hears you loud and clear, there is no reason to post the same thing thousands of times because Epic knows.

Read to the end of this post, if you don’t agree with me, downvote, don’t just downvote because of my title. I’m open to discussion in the comments.

I’ve been seeing lots of people up in arms about the removal of the siphon feature, and while I am sad to see this feature go, it’s overall a healthy thing for the game. The entire point of the siphon feature in the first place was to test how people started playing in the default playlists. Think back to glider redeploy during Season 6 Fortnitemares. Was that healthy for the game? Most people would say “No”. Now, think about the shields/health per kill feature. This feature promotes thirsting and brought a lot of toxicity to the game because of that.

It’s funny to me that most people who’ve complained about the amount of sweats lately are so mad about the shield/health per kill feature leaving, as this was one of the biggest parts of why they’d play so aggressively as you would also get 50/50/50 material per kill, which means they don’t have to spend the early game farming, and instead they can be killing. Killing you.

I myself am very sad to see the material cap being reverted, as I’m sure many people are as well, because I could farm materials quickly, and be forced to play more tactically.

My suggestion is that they create a hybrid of the normal system and siphon system. Reduce the material cap down to 500/500/500, and make farming faster again, but don’t grant shield/health per kills.

This will make Fortnite feel more like a PvP, rather than a farming simulator. It will reduce the amount people push, and make good players play just a little more carefully.

For duos and squads no one gets health regeneration until entire team is eliminated
 An option is to grant 15 hp per kill (squads) /30 hp (duos) to your whole team.  For example Team A eliminates 3 people from team B but one got away. Then Team C eliminates the final player from team B. As soon as the final player from that team is eliminated. The All remaining players of Team A receive 45 health and all remaining players from Team C receive 15 health. Or something along these lines such as leaving the 50 health and just for the people that got the kills but still keeping the idea that no one receives this health until entire team is gone which should cut down on thirsting as well as being able to get rewarded for kills.

I’m pretty sure most of the community can agree with me when I say that the removal of the health/shield per kill and the mats per kill initiatives was a TERRIBLE mistake, And you of all people know this. You have gotten tag after tag after tag of streamers and you tubers alike on twitter saying how “This is the worst battle royal update EVER!” And “I might uninstall until they revert the 8.20 patch!”.

The Solution (please point out any suggestions):

In all duos and squads modes, I suggest only being able to receive the 50 shield/ health per kill after the entire team is dead, and this will help get rid of this so called “over aggressiveness”, and make so that you’re not as focused on finishing the kill as you are in killing the rest of the opposing team.

And as far as solos goes, perhaps it can act like a slurp juice in that you will still get the health, it will just take 50 seconds.

If anybody has any suggestions or changes they think would better this idea please feel free to say so.
Please take into consideration!

The goal was for average players to have a more fun, laid back experience, while higher skilled players have a mode that suits their playstyles better. Getting health and mats off of kills rewards skill, and putting that mechanic into a competitive gamemode makes a lot of sense. Having that change in regular lobbies made it hard for average players to keep up with higher skilled players in my experience. Getting used to those changes and having them ripped from you does suck, but if you want that kind of faster paced action there is still an option to have it. Just a thought though, I may be completely wrong.

If people want to play with people around their skill level, but also love Team Rumble, or enjoy playing Team Rumble a lot, they are unable to currently enjoy Team Rumble right now due to the amount of players with higher skill level then them.

Furthermore, Team Rumble already is a randomized set of players, for the most part, placed together to fight against the opposing team. Due to the rng of player placement in Team Rumble, this creates a lot of scenarios where one team is completely overpowering and overbearing for the opposing team.

I hated fortnite when the mat update happened so i didnt play for like a month after it went live. I fell as if having less mats and having them harder to get makes the game slower paced and i like that alot. So i feel as if they shouldve kept the 500 mats thing but changed the mat gains.

After a bit of game play, I'm still in open, but it's definitely not a disaster run at competitive. I was averaging something like 5ppg and am well on my way to breaking in to contender... 

With that said, it's only a matter of time till I get served and edited on every game because I'm not on KBM. That's fine, I'll be at my limit, so whatever. 

With all that said, I typically play a lot squads and with the way the pubs play now that everything has reverted, the constant third partying and hunt for shield is already tiring af. 

I'm very seriously considering giving the game a break for one whole month. I feel like one month away is enough for me to break a very real addiction to something that has felt unhealthy for some time. I feel like one month will allow me to see the game for what it truly is or isn't. If after one month I can honestly say that despite breaking the addition, I really want to play it, then I'll give it a try again. If the skill gap has left me behind then I'll just take that as a sign that it's the right time to move on. 

I can spend more time with my wife, who I'm sure will appreciate it, focus on my career development instead of countless hours playing Fortnite and possibly try some other titles. 

I'm thinking the whole of April. This is just me being accountable and if I continue to post here like a miserable pleb that means that I've not stuck to what I said I would do (or strangely my sentiments towards the game have turned full circle).

     This is about keeping the game balanced.  I’m not sure if anyone noticed but when siphon was implemented.  It was very noticeable how many more people were eliminated before first storm close.   So your left with a very big area with fewer than expected players.  Also keep in mind the map grew 15-20% last season.   
So to keep the game more balanced they had few options.   Either speed up the times on the storm, revert to the original style, or somehow shrink the map.   They made the best decision.  We’ve always had to loot and mat up quick before fighting. This helps keep the first circles remaining players at a total that suits the space. It helps you remain in the game more than 2 minutes as well.   
Y’all got a test of something for a few weeks and are acting like a bunch of toddlers because it didn’t work.

1. A HUUUGE earthquake will shake across the whole map.
2. The tremors will cause the volcano to erupt.
3. Whilst this happens, a storm of lightning starts to swirl over the Volcano.
4. The lava pouring from the volcano will pour down the hillside destroying the Caravan park and parts of Retail Row.
5. The lightning will strike the lava numerous time.
6. On the last lightning strike, 3 forks of it will come off. 1 hits No Sweat Insurance in tilted, one hits the pirate ship in lazy and one strikes the centre of the lava.
7. The lava then starts to bubble.
8. It forms into a tetrahedron and starts zapping areas of the map. Again, they each hit, The Tower in Lonely Lodge. The Iceberg (Polar Peak). Pleasant Park and lucky landing. 
9. Like the rocket the Tetrahedron goes on a ride across the map for this.
10. Then the Tetrahedron explodes over Salty Springs. 
11. Every (alive) person gets teleported to the In-Between.
12. The Enforcer is there. He is piecing together a shape.
13. It comes together to form a Molten Lion. The lion duplicates and runs to every person.
14. The Lions forms with your person (and maybe changes the skin. you could get a selectbale lava style for the skin you're wearing, i dunno)
15. You get transported back to salty. It has been scattered with lave and fragments of orange crystal.

Places where lightning struck have Zombie spawners and lava..

#### **The Good:**

The LTM is full of wackiness fun. At a point, lava begins to rise.

It encourages different gameplay and ensures that the Storm isn't the only hazard. You could camp in the early game but lava will rise and sooner or later, the only original point still above lava at the final circles would be the castle on top of Polar Peak.

#### **The Bad:**

My only issue is that there are serious lack of vehicles and mobility. The storm rolls in faster than normal so it's very easy to get caught in the storm, combined with the short time between circle shrinking times.

#### **The Ugly:**

Why is Lazy Lagoon already mostly submerged in lava in the start? Yes, it's one of the lowest points but shouldn't the starting lava be lowered by two tiles?

------
#### **My Thoughts**

It's clear the LTM could be improved on a bit.

Vehicles could be enabled but anytime the Baller is rolling on lava, it'll gradually take damage as the glass begins to crack and melt. Cannons are also oddly disabled but should be enabled. They come in handy if you need to get away from the storm. Throw in Quadcrasher... Twisted Metal 2, anyone? 

Certain objects that could float on lava could make the LTM more enjoyable. Cars, pallets (wood but fuck logic), and vending machines (won't disappear after use) could float on lava, effectively making them makeshift rafts.

It's also clear that the storm could be adjusted. Possibly make it continuous like Steady Storm.

Epic did this previously with the glider redeploy where they got us used to a new addition, and then took it away when we all got comfortable with it. They need to stop with these so called “Tests” and just make a community poll for **PERMANENT** additions. This screws with the meta way too much, and they’re losing their playerbase’s loyalty and trust here.

(And I know some people are happy about them removing this feature, but why? Why are you against aggressive play in a battle royale game?

It really doesn’t seem like Epic wants to listen to the people who play their game. Siphon mode encouraged fun, fast-paced, kill-rewarding gameplay.

As a bot who often hides in places and always tried to 3rd party to sneak a kill in the past, I was worried when the siphon first came out that I would pretty much never get a kill since people would regain health after fighting someone else. 

However, it’s only helped me improve, as I’ve had to face other people in times when they weren’t at 10 hp. The siphon has encouraged me to fight others not only during third party and has helped me improve as a player. I still hide a lot, but I don’t see how the siphon has hurt the gameplay of anyone. 

Also, it’s nice to kill someone and get health back myself, as if I don’t regain anything, I am probably an insta kill for the next person I see.

Here’s why: People had more of an incentive to thirst you, it gave better players the advantage because they had a better chance of staying at a constant 100hp and 100 shield, it was an instant 50 health/shield without a timer (like the big shields 5 seconds, the small shields 2 seconds, etc), and overall it’s a battle royale game. You’re supposed to end a battle and be somewhat hurt and not end up with 200HP after every fight. Please get it in your heads that it is basically unfair for everyone.",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;

i'd very much prefer to have shield and health on kills in pubs though just for the record, because hate getting thirdpartied and/or having to play a lot more conservative most of the time, but yeah, for me not a dealbreaker, I think..not sure :S it is what it is, lets see what happens,


&amp;nbsp;

however, what i'm really curious about is, is there ANYONE out there that likes the slow farming rate? im sure someone will say 999 material cap is better than 500 for whatever reason they have, but when it takes forever to get those mats is it really better than 500 cap and a lot faster farming? ofcourse this was a newer addition to pub games but once you had something good and its taken away you miss it, its normal, and compared to health/shield on kill I think there is pretty much only negatives with slow farming? or?

&amp;nbsp;

would like to hear opinions on this anyway!

But here's just a couple of my problems with it

&amp;#x200B;

* Pump shotguns are a must have weapon(Especially earlygame)
* Certain weapons (Pistols, Tacs, Scoped Ars etc) you practically have no chance against an equally skilled opponent with a better weapon unless they make a major mistake

&amp;#x200B;

I like the old system with shotguns where they can one shot full shields and health BUT they can't one shot a 100 health player with a bodyshot. For example with a pistol you need 3 headshots but the guy with the blue pump needs one bodyshot. A little rng is ok but that's huge rng right there plus there's big bloom on pistols so there's no guarantee you'll even hit where you're aiming. A power curve is ok but when it's to the point where you literally need something that's wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things that I think will make it a little more fair while keeping the power curve is reducing the bloom on pistols, Reduce damage of pumps to 80,85,90,95 but increase the headshot multipler to what it was in early seasons(this rewards headshots over just finding a blue pump and hitting a bodyshot), either reduce spread on the tac shotgun slightly or increase the headshot multipler, take scoped weapons(except snipers obviously) out of solos but keep them in duos, squads, large team modes because they have uses when working as a team but not so much in solos.",FortNiteBR

I was using 800x600 resolution on my laptop since Season 3 and got stable 45-65 FPS most of the time before the v8.30 update. After the update, game is pretty much unplayable with 10-25 FPS, massive stuttering when turning the camera and it pretty much freezes when there's action on the screen with FPS going bellow 10. I was hoping these little updates after the patch would fix it, but they didn't.  
What I tried:

* Changing resolution (this has almost no effect, even setting the resolution at 1366x768, which is max for my system, results in the same FPS as using 800x600);
Changing graphic settings, 3D resolution, AA, Texture Quality (almost no change in FPS, even after setting these settings to Epic. These settings were previously turned off and 3D resolution was set to 100%);
* Turning off replays and setting audio quality to low (no effect); 
* Tried playing Creative mode (same performance issues);
* Changed priority in Task Manager to High and tried changing cores in ""Set Affinity"" menu (no effect);
* Reinstalling the entire game (no effect).
What I noticed in Task manager was that the game was not using 100% of the CPU, it was jumping between 70%-99% percent and apparently people with dual-core processors are having a similar performance issues.

My specs (*I know they are probably bellow minimum requirements, but the game was totally playable since season 3 when I started playing*):

* Graphics card: AMD Radeon HD 7500/7600 Series, 1GB;

When Fortnite downloads any patches, press the ""Downloads"" button on the launcher, there you will see this data (translating from spanish by my own):

* Fortnite (update percentage).
* Download.
* Read.
* Write.
* Operations / Task.

A patch can be divided into ""packets"", think on them like being several pieces of files of an update, each update is divided on several files mainly to avoid file corruption if the download stops due any reason such as crashing or connection drop.

The issue is that... you may notice how the launcher stops ""Download"", ""Operations"" and ""Write"" but not ""Read"" a lot of times, this is likely because the Launcher is programmed to verify and maybe replace files on the installation path after have downloaded every packet, then applies the packet and continue downloading the rest of packets, repeating the same process after download another one.

So, on an almost 7GB update, instead of perfectly could take less than 10 minutes to update, the game takes over 30 minutes even on a SSD hardware, meaning that **the kind of storage you use is UNRELEVANT for this launcher.**

**Console platforms doesn't have this issue. This is exclusive to PC using Epic Games Launcher.**

Consoles doesn't have the same process of update &amp; verification than in PC, there, if the download is stopped due any reason, the download may still be resumed without any issue thus not requiring any process of verification other than know the current patch version to start downloading the required ones.

&amp;#x200B;

Major problem of that is, **imagine if a single 150mb update is divided into five or ten packets and Epic Launcher is doing a full verification after every 50mb downloaded... the update time can perfectly be increased by x10 or more...**

The most weird of everything is that after downloaded 146 of 148mb update, you may see how the launcher stopped download but is Reading 64mb/s and writting 284mb/s during more than ten minutes... I mean... WHAT THE FUCK IS DOING THE LAUNCHER ACTING LIKE IT JUST DOWNLOADED 50GB OF UPDATE WITH A 146MB PATCH?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired to have to wait even 10 minutes OR MORE for a single 150mb update due how bad programmed Epic Launcher is.

As I said before, the verification process should be taken either at the begining, or at the end, but not after every packet downloaded.

&amp;#x200B;

I've used Free Updaters on personal projects programmed by beginners updating much better than this worthless updater programmed by a multibillonaire company. I don't think that a launcher used by partners of other game companies should work like ""also being in early access"" state.",FortNiteBR

-Reduce pump and tac pullout time
-Increase rate of fire for both types
-Implement a different pump reload in between shots
-Fix the issue that lets a player shoot a pump faster if they edit a build in between shots. (It negates the wait time due to the pullout)

Let's face it, besides the days you just don't care, every chance you can you drop the tac for the pump. The tac has a ""pump-like"" fire rate for the incredibly inconsistent damage numbers and the pumps rate of fire is just a joke.

I would personally like to see all SMG's vaulted due to everyone's loadout being the same, save for those using flints now instead. But it would allow for more strategic loadouts. I don't like the silenced smg at all, but hey, the things an overpowered laser so I carry it.

I love the style of this game, how its a different BR game, EPIC as developers, its all great. It's just hard to have fun these days",FortNiteBR

But on to the main point of this post, purple skull trooper the outfit we all know and some love as the most original fortnite skin to date released on fortnitemares of 2017 and wasn't seen again until fortnitemares of 2018.

TSM_myths most favorite skin 

Why did OGs get soo excited to get this purple style? Is because they can flex off that they are an OG and not some kid who begged his or her parents to buy it and yell out IM AN OG!!!!


But my main point here is that ever since OGs got purple skull trooper for buying him on fortnitemares of 2017 there have been constant begging for new skin styles for skins that they have which is getting kinda out of hand now 


Who do I blame for this? 
Epic games of course I don't understand why they would favor the players who bought something the first time around and I hope they don't do it again.

In MY OPINION they never should have gave skull trooper a different style for OG buyers 

And before some people comment "" but what about the reflex skin he was exclusive to a NVIDIA GeForce graphics card and they sold him in the shop for 1200 vbucks"" first things first reflex is a PC exclusive who had a different variant because in epics fault they decided to release a PC exclusive to the item shop that you had to buy a specific item to aquire.

That's different than buying an item shop skin and being entitled to a new style because you bought it the first time around is completely unfair and wrong.


TLDR: epic should have never gave a new style to original skull trooper buyers it's the main reason a lot of people are begging for new styles for other skins

The only reason pros hated the planes is the fact that it is a flying vehicle that is quote on quote “harder” to shoot down than a tall build. If they replace the planes with helicopters that had no guns but two people could shoot out of it with their guns, sweaties would hate it simply because it is a flying vehicle.

I hate to say it, but V-bucks are kind of a rip-off.  
Let me explain why. So to start, let's compare V-Bucks to two other types of in-game currency from other games: Robux from Roblox, and Gems from Clash of Clans and Clash Royale.

Starting off, the prices for these three currencies are about the same.

&amp;#x200B;

[Clash of Clans's Gem Shop](https://i.redd.it/utct71czsnr21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

[Roblox's Robux Shop](https://i.redd.it/ogfq9an5tnr21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

[V-Buck Shop!](https://i.redd.it/6wv0fmzbtnr21.png)

So, as you can tell, they all cost about 0.01 USD per unit (Gem/Robuk/V-Buck).

Now, let's see what you can buy with 1000 gems in Clash of Clans:

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vl6i8pnotnr21.png

Yeah, you can speed up something for a WEEK.

Now, Roblox is different does to the insane variety of games, but here's what you can do in one game.

&amp;#x200B;

[My sister plays this game all the time. You'd need to farm for 8+ hours to make this much.](https://i.redd.it/a4cttcc0unr21.png)

But in Fortnite?

&amp;#x200B;

[Hmm. I could get... 2 emotes, some battle pass tiers, or I could almost afford Absolute Zero.](https://i.redd.it/rdhyd04aunr21.png)

Never mind the fact that these items are cosmetic only.

Now, I'm not arguing to make them not cosmetic only! That would be terrible and the game would essentially become P2W.

But we need a way for

a) F2P players to get some of these skins, and

b) 2 rare emotes not costing ten fucking dollars.

So here's my idea.

For each match you enter, you get:

1 V-Buck for each elimination 

In Team Rumble, you lose 1 V-Buck from your total each time you die

1 V-Buck for every 200 damage you deal to a player (You do not get this bonus if you kill the player and instead get the 2 V-Buck bonus)

5 bonus V-Bucks for placing in the Top 10

7 V-Bucks for placing Top 5

10 V-Bucks for getting second place, and:

25 V-Bucks for winning the Victory Royale. (The placing bonuses do not apply in Team Rumble).

You also lose 1 V-Buck as Bus Fare.

You can also get other bonuses:

Lucky Break: For killing a player with 1 HP remaining, you get 2 V-Bucks.

WhAt?: For no-scoping a player with a sniper rifle, you get 2 V-Bucks.

One Pump Man: For killing a player that had over 100 HP remaining in one hit with a green pump shotgun. (Better pumps are too easy to one hit) you get 2 V-Bucks.

Builder: For using over 3000 materials in one game, you get 3 V-Bucks.

Right Back At Ya: For winning an encounter when you had equal or lower health than your opponent and the opponent got the first hit, you get 4 V-Bucks.

Sneaky Sniper: For sniping more than 3 opponents, you get 4 V-Bucks.

I Killed Em' Rollin: For destroying 2+ Ballers in a single match, you get 4 V-Bucks.

Noice: For killing a player that was using a weapon 2 rarities or more better than yours (Gray Vs. Blue, Green Vs. Purple, Blue Vs. Gold), you get 5 V-Bucks.

Coming in Clutch: For winning the game with less than 50 HP, you get 5 V-Bucks.

Full Power Activate: For having a full set of legendary weapons, full health and full shield, and full materials at the same time, you get 6 V-Bucks.

God, is that you?: For getting more than 3 kills without missing a single shot, you get 20 V-Bucks.

V-Bucks should also be slightly cheaper. What do you think?

The subreddit has officially received a Support-A-Creator code, usable in the in-game item shop starting now.

You are able to use the code **REDDIT** before purchasing any item in the item shop to support the subreddit.

##### What is a Support-A-Creator code?

A Support-A-Creator code allows players to support their favourite creators by entering their code in the item shop before purchasing anything, allowing for a portion of that amount to go to the creator. Specifically, every 10,000 vbucks spent using the code will give $5 back to the creator. In this case, if you use the code REDDIT, you will be giving back directly to the subreddit and supporting the community.

You can enter a Support-A-Creator code by pressing the “Support a Creator” button in the item shop both in Save the World and Battle Royale.

[For more information on the program itself click here.](https://www.epicgames.com/affiliate/en-US/overview?sessionInvalidated=true)

##### Where do the proceeds go?

The proceeds go directly to the subreddit's Community Pool. Using the Community Pool, moderators can organize future events and plan giveaways/prizes for those events, maintain services (e.g., multiple bots like our newly designed flair picker). [You can find more details on the Community Pool and our plans for all proceeds gathered here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bbdocp/snoo_contest_community_jar/)

We hope to offer a way for users to use the code and directly support the subreddit at the same time. We'd love to hear your thoughts regarding this and any creative things you would like to see done with the proceeds.

Thanks!",FortNiteBR

I have a problem and it looks like there are many people who are facing the same issue.

I am playing fortnite on a low-end PC:

* Intel Xeon W3520
* 8GB RAM DDR3
* AMD Radeon 7470 HD

&amp;#x200B;

**Game settings:**

* All low
* 1280x720 resolution
* 33.3% 3D resolution

&amp;#x200B;

**Before v8.30:**

I used to get 30-60+ FPS (during the game), rarely got FPS drops.

&amp;#x200B;

**After v8.30:**

The game is fine in pre-game lobby and Creative mode, but it became much worse during BR games.

While I am in the bus, it is okay (still no renders started), when I jump, it is still okay.

**BUT** as I get closer to the ground (render occurs), the FPS drops more and more, and not a temp. drop, it drops and stay at that low FPS. When I am directly in front of a house but still in the air, it is 7-15 FPS (max).

The game should be done with rendering now but what happens that even after that it is stuck between 15-30FPS (max).

&amp;#x200B;

Please, do not ignore my post, please see if it can be fixed soon or tell us if the game won't run as before on low-end PCs so I can stop trying fixes (scanning my PC, updating all drivers and tracking PC usage).

With the World Cup coming soon and I am in Champion league and willing to participate in the event for fun, I am now losing my points as it is impossible to play.

&amp;#x200B;

If needed, my IGN is: LTS ElzeerX

Thanks in advance :)",FortNiteBR

I honestly think if Epic made polls of every update and separate them into 2 different categories (one for casuals and one for competitive) it would be soo much better of a game in terms of content.
Whenever a bug appears that is game changing it becomes their priority to fix it ASAP. 

Now i know fortnite is a much bigger game than OSRS but I genuinely think the can make it work if they want. Imagine how good this game would be if the player base had a say in development",FortNiteBR

If you're playing Team Rumble to land behind someone and shoot them in the back right before someone lands behind you and shoots you in the back ... then I guess you are loving the recent changes.

If you'd rather get some practice in building, editing and shooting or once in while have a good 1v1 or 1v2, then I doubt you will enjoy the ""chaotic late game"" that Epic proudly promotes.

​​​​​With the 150 goal and the tiny final circle, a lot more players on the losing side are leaving the match early.

If you are on the losing side it means that you are forced to land close to enemies that outnumber you every time you drop back in. It can be OK because it gives you a lot of practice in defending yourself against multiple spraying opponents, but it makes even more players leave the match.

If you are on the winning side, prepare to spend the last ten minutes not being able to find any opponents because most of them get lasered out of the sky before they can even land.

In conclusion: This is a horrible change, and I will probably just play until the second to last circle starts closing and then leave the match, and start a new one.


And about the claimed reduction in RPG spawn:
""-Supply drops now drop two Legendary weapons and two additional consumables
-Decreased RPG spawn chances by 50% in chests and 67% in supply drops""

So decreased the chance of a weapon from a supply drop being an RPG, but doubled the amount of weapons from supply drops ...
Decreasing 50 % from chests sounds like a lot but is actually insignificant because the drop rate was so low from chests in the first place.
Result: Pretty much the same amount of RPGs in the game - they were still everywhere when I played last night.",FortNiteBR

https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bbl1vc/oh_my_god_they_actually_did_improve_the/

&amp;nbsp;

it felt too good to be true and I guess it was kind of :D after the 80mb mini-patch (I think it was to adress performance on dual-core cpus?) i'm now having major stutters and frame drops, even if the max fps is still good and at 120 even in tilted towers, whenever I flick the mouse fast or turn around etc, i'm getting crazy stutters and drops to 50-90 fps down from the 120 framecap :/

&amp;nbsp;

they obviously changed something with the 80mb update but seems to have affected some users/cpus negatively, anyone else have the same experience or just me? :S i'm on a old 4 core i5-3470 cpu / 2x4gb ddr3 ram / gtx 1060 6gb, but low settings on everything and graphics card is barely utilized, ~ 50-55 % or so,

probably a longshot but tagging epic in hope of this getting noticed or if any info is needed, cheers !

I think I'm pretty good relative to the people I play against, obviously no where near as good as a streamer/pro player. I've played since season 3 strictly on console.

I own a very good gaming PC which I use for other games, but was wondering if it would be worth it to also play Fortnite on it. I've played probably ten matches on PC total, my aiming is fine, definitely my strongest attribute (I've played tons of shooters on PC, ex: CSGO &amp; COD). However, my building is absolute potato tier. Sometimes feels like a foreign game when I'm playing, making simple mistakes such as jamming walls in my own face when trying to take the high ground or defend myself from a distance.

I like where my key binds are at and I've been trying to get used to it but I can tell it will take at the absolute least a few weeks to get even close to how good I am on console. Also, my friends play on console too so I'd have to crossplay with them thus putting them in KB+M lobbies.
PC obviously has a lot of advantages hardware wise, the game is a lot smoother and I get over double the FPS on console (60-&gt;144).

Should I just be happy with where I'm at on Xbox, or do you think switching to PC is worth it at this point?",FortNiteBR

The reason I ask the question I raised is because nearly every game I run into a brand new account with a default and some witty season 8 name that is running through the match pushing people and basically destroying the lobby. I understand they have long wait times and that this problem stems from that. Regardless, these arena matches are supposed to be against people of similar skill, that’s the whole point. If all of the best players just make 15 accounts constantly pushing through lobbies of lower skilled players, they are ruining that game for that lobby. This should not be allowed. Consoles do not have the ability to create an epic account, they’d have to purchase a whole other live account and connect it to that.

When im in game i get 140 fps which im use to in other games but im still getting that 100% cpu and gpu even though the games running smooth. something feels off any suggestions?

The problem was that Native resolution is just simply put BAD. Read carefully.,"Hey I am a very active competitive Fortniteplayer and a long term member of r/noncompetitive. 



First of all I want to say that yes using a custom stretched resolution gives you infact an advantage over native.


Though this is less the fault of stretched but rather because the Native resolution Fortnite uses is inherently bad. 


The native resolution (or rather the FOV of the native resolution) was based on the PVE mode of Fortnite (or more or less the base game) which indeed was ONLY PVE.


Neither was the this game and its FOV on native resolution ever intended as a PVP game and especially not things like 50 people end zones and crazy build fights. 


Though over the last 14 month these kind of gameplays developed into being the best way to play this game to win. 


Now lets talk about the problems of ""native"" resolution. 

1. Your character model is WAY to large especially in short distance situations. This is abuse able by for example simply walking to the right when fighting someone and with this walking ""into their"" character model. 
This is an example by /u/DestinysJesus a great education content creator (Please note that this tactic also works on stretched but it is MUCH more effective on native resolution): https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aves6p/how_to_win_every_close_range_fight_crouch_swinging/  
How to fix this? Either by increasing POV or by making your character to some degree transparent. 

2. Your character still from time to time covers your cross hair in certain angles or with certain skins. I was not able to reproduce this with my own stretched resolution (1279x1080). 
Problem should be obvious. You cant shoot.

3. Tracking your opponents is MUCH more difficult. 
Why? Well in buildfights the core aspect of playing is to gain a high ground over your opponent and with this have a controlling position and and better angles onto him. With the lower Vertical FOV of native resolution people aboth you are MUCH harder to see if not actually completely out of your vision. 
A good example would be this clip by bumpaah: 
https://www.twitch.tv/bumpaah/clip/SlipperyDarlingWasabiTBTacoLeft?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time

4. The larger amount of pixels goes crazy onto the games performance. Especially in HIGH level gameplay and crazy end zones the performance is already VERY bad and and for consoles more or less impossible to play. With stretched and the so reduced amount of pixels PC player were able to gain a few more fps (like 40-50) which improves the quality and the fun of the game DRAMATICALLY. 

5. The very limited amount of vision forces you on high level to move like crazy to gather information. Inside the competitive Community a lot of people complained about nausea, headaches and motion sickness. It feels a bit like sitting on a rocking ship. Especially when switching from a medium or high cross hair position to locking downwards and back up. This forces you to massive motions and distance covered and feels kind a shit. 
Though probably over weeks/months of training it probably will go away. Still sucks though for the people having to switch.

6. The amount of area you can see around you is just to small (this is partly already a problem in buildfights that I discussed under point 3). I will show you an example of what I mean:
https://i.redd.it/x3ehy6o074q21.jpg . 
It should be obvious that the left picture is the stretched one and in any cases the (from a quality of gameplay standpoint) few superior resolution. I am pretty sure most people would actually prefer to SEE shit. 


So how to fix this? Well give us the ability to increase FOV on native so we can actually SEE something beside the WAY to large character model and the 1 wall before us. 

A race should be made fair by giving everyone the same opportunities and not by breaking the lags of the fastest runners. 


TL:DR Give a way to increase FOV or to make the character smaller/transparent to improve the vision as native is a really BAD resolution. ",FortNiteBR

Whether it be redeploy or health/shield per elimination, people have been outraged when these things have been taken away.  Yes, the community has been outraged at many things, like planes and the infinity sword, which were game breaking and listening to the community was the right move.  However, Epic SHOULD NOT listen to the community on redeploy and health/shield per elim.  If Epic were to listen all the time, people we be able to redeploy into a fight, get low on health, kill everyone, get full health instantly, and go somewhere else and repeat.  Games would last 5, maybe 10 minutes max.  That is not Battle Royale.  Battle Royales are supposed to be long drawn out games.  Yes, it sucks to get third parties and yea there are times when these things would be nice, but that's part of what makes a Battle Royale a Battle Royale.  With these fast paced tendencies, casual players who aren't great but play for fun would be repeatedly stomped on and stop playing.  As a result, more sweaty players would fill the lobbies in place of these casuals, and as a result the casuals who were good at the game but don't care to play sweaty would find it way to hard and stop playing.  This trend would continue until the playerbase eats itself up.  Let's prevent this from happening guys, because I for one love fortnite and would hate to see it fall apart.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Epic should not add health/shield per elim or any other mechanic that makes fortnite a more fast-paced game, for it is a battle royale which is not supposed to be a fast paced game.

Not one pro level gamer has ever adopted a 21:9 display for competitive advantage in any competitive game ever.

Not in LoL, Not in Dota, Not in CSGO, not WoW, Paragon(Rip), SMITE, Blade and Soul, Quake, Rocket League.

Not one exists.

Do you know why? Because, it doesn't provide anyone a tangible applicable competitive advantage.

IF it did, then pro level gamers would have adopted 21:9 and wider monitors in droves. 

What did they adopt instead? 144hz and 240hz monitors.

So why are you restricting parts of Fortnite to 16:9 based on a Myth, with no evidence supporting it, but not restricting high refreshrate monitors instead which we have a nearly 100% adoption rate of in Competitive gaming because Professional gamers KNOW That those monitors give them a competitive edge.

Don't you think it's a bit strange that you'd be restricting something that essentially doesn't matter and has never mattered to anyone except people who prefer immersive gameplay?

But you leave the actual competitive advantage open that only certain people can legitimately afford?

Infact, you know that stretched resolution thing that CSGO and Quake players sometimes do? We don't even have any evidence if those players are even gaining any advantage from that stretched method. It's just a personal preference as far as evidence shows.

Epic, this is a ridiculous change, and is completely unnecessary. You're punishing people who have done nothing wrong, chasing a bogey man that doesn't exist.

So go head, show me one professional gamer in any game that supports native 21:9, that has ever qualified online or BYOC for a tournamnet with 21:9 Monitor.

You can't because they don't exist.

What I'm referring too:

Lots of users have been requesting for new flairs of skins to be added. Such as: carbon commando, bandolette, marino, lucky rider, laguna, kuno, kenji, psion, axiom, malice, beastmode, slugger, fastball, molten valkyrie, and molten battle hound.

You're probably thinking ""Well yeah, you added all the others, why not these?""

Simple. Reddit has a User Flair **Template** limit of 350. With the Fall Skirmish flairs, our special ones (like the best of flair), and the mass amount of skins that exist in Fortnite, we've hit this limit.

Now, we could go through the data and remove the least-used skins, but that's not really fair to the people who use them, or may want to in the future.

So I came up with another solution, one that most other subreddits use. You can now message /u/FortniteStatusBot to assign a flair.

There's 2 ways to go about this.

##Method One:

###Select a flair from my website and send the generated message to the bot.

[Click here to visit the flair selection page](https://canyourcode.com/fortnite). My website is not anything special, and this page isn't very optimized for mobile. I'll be working on it as I get time to make it easier to use on mobile and other devices.

Simply choose BR or STW from the ""mode"" dropdown, then select your flair by clicking (or tapping) one of the flair images. A new button will appear, clicking it **redirects you to reddit** with a pre-filled message to send to FortniteStatusBot. Hit send, and wait for the ""Success!"" message from the bot.

##Method Two:

###Sending a message directly

You are welcome to skip using the website and message the bot directly. However, it will not listen to just *any* message. You have to follow a strict format:

**Message Subject:**

&gt; SET FLAIR

**Message Body:**

&gt;SUBREDDITS[/r/SUBREDDIT /r/OTHERSUBREDDIT]

&gt;FLAIR_NAME[Malice]

Valid options for subreddits are: /r/FortniteBR, /r/FortniteCreative, /r/FortniteMobile. (You can mix and match, or use one, or all 3. Just don't add the commas.)

/r/Fortnite can be used, but must be standalone, it cannot be updated along side the others. Doing so may result in the incorrect flair being assigned.

As for the flair name, just put in the actual name of the skin. Eg: Bandolette, Malice, Rust Lord, so on.

After it's filled out hit the send button, and once again wait for the ""Success!"" message from the bot.

I heard about the competitive changes yesterday so I just tried out native res and I literally cannot play like that after being accustomed to 900x1080. I feel slow, can't see much, and it's just a bad experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Right before world cup stretched is being removed, just why? They have no actual reason for removing it in competitive modes. The common argument is that it is ""unfair"" to console players. CONSOLE PLAYERS WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR WORLD CUP. When has a console player gotten into top 100 of a qualifier? There has been like 1 console player in any open tournament. Console has no chance compared to PC. If there are people actually trying to qualify for worlds on console, it will not happen, switch to pc or stop complaining. If you want to play Fortnite with a controller or anything else, you can't be on a console. 

&amp;#x200B;

Nice job trying to ""balance"" the game by getting rid of stretched in competitive. What fools are making these changes over at Epic?",FortNiteBR

There are too many weapons and items that people simply do not use. Finding some of these things early game almost comes as a death sentence. Here are some changes that I think would improve the quality of life in core modes:

Weapons:
-Vault common pistol
-Vault scoped revolver
-Vault flint knock pistol
-Vault dual pistols
-Vault thermal scoped ar 
-Vault epic minigun
-Vault rare/epic grenade launcher &amp; epic rpg
-Vault infantry rifle, unvault uncommon/rare burst
-Vault uncommon/rare pump, unvault heavy shotgun &amp; change rarity to uncommon/rare

Consumables:
-Unvault grappler
-Unvault port-a-fortress

Traps:
-Vault turret 
-Unvault bouncers

Along with these vaults/unvaults, here are some other small changes I would love to see:

Nerfs/Buffs:
-Nerf to rocket limit
-Slight buff to tac shotgun
-Buff hand cannon damage to structure (only enough to one-shot wooden structures), nerf hand cannon clip size to 5
-Buff shotgun ammo drops from 4 to 5
-Buff material floor drops (50 wood, 40 brick, 30 metal)

Other changes:
-Remove pump draw animation when there is only 1 shotgun in your inventory
-Give chug jugs a total of 200 effective health that decreases as you use it (ex: if you have 75 hp and 25 shield, drinking a chug would give you +100 effective health and the remaining 100 in the chug would still be available)
-Ammo crates have a 100% spawn rate and ammo no longer spawns as floor loot without an appropriate weapon next to it
-Add a 5th items to chests to make them always contain a healing item

Everyone can agree with that, and pretty much everyone can agree that there needs to be changes to end that. With the incoming nerfs to stretched res, Epic is trying to shrink the gap between the platforms. In theory, this is a good idea. In reality, it is not. There are three possible solutions to this problem.

1)  Limit the potential of PC so console can keep up.

This is the solution Epic is trying to pursue right now. The problem with this is that as a result, the quality of life for PC goes down and the QOL of console stays relatively stagnant. There is no way this can be interpreted as a positive outcome. Limiting a platform only makes the game worse, it makes everyone have the same problems instead of fixing them. By removing stretched res, Epic is handicapping PC to the benefit of no one. I believe Epic should reconsider their approach.

2) Increase the potential of console so it can keep up with PC.

This is simply impossible. There can be some changes Epic can make to console to put it on a more even playing field with PC, such as a FOV slider. But that will never change the fact that a PC will always be a superior experience by definition no matter what they do. Consoles are limited by poor hardware and a restrictive OS. They are not going to be able to reach 144+ FPS, they won‚Äôt be able to go into the files to activate stretched res. It takes an enormous amount of optimization just for the game to run at 30-60 FPS.

3) Separate the two platforms in all modes.

THIS is the solution Epic needs to pursue. Remember how with solution 1, PC‚Äôs QOL was lowered while console was relatively stagnant, resulting in an overall negative experience? This is the opposite: console‚Äôs QOL will increase (something it desperately needs right now) and PC‚Äôs will be relatively stagnant. The vast majority of the community will think this is a positive change. If Epic does this, PC gets to keep its higher QOL because any advantages PC has will be irrelevant to console because they are completely separate. PC gets to keep its advantages and have a better experience, console does not have to play against them, it‚Äôs a win for everyone.

This isn‚Äôt a perfect solution, however. There are some problems that arise, such as even longer queue times in the Champions division. But there will not be very many console players in Champions anyway, so I doubt that it will have a major impact on queue times. Also, Epic is going to add the option to play a normal or creative match while waiting to load into a lobby. 

Overall, I think this is a superior solution to the one Epic is planning to use. Stretched res is something a lot of people really liked using. I do not like the look of native res and while I wouldn‚Äôt quit the game, it definitely would have a negative impact on my experience playing it. I ask Epic to reconsider the stretched res changes and instead separate console and PC lobbies in Arena.",FortNiteBR

the sound is still garbage

every update my frames just slowly deteriorate (when i started season 4 i could easily stream, keep max settings, and have chrome and discord open while maintaining 150+ fps, now i can‚Äôt even stream while in a discord call without my textures not loading in)

a horrible meta ever since season 5

unbalanced phasing mechanics 

unbalanced items (hamsterball, heavy, and sadly the gold/purple pump)

removal of stretched res

no separation of communities at all.

the dissatisfaction of consumers like, genuinely i play with real life friends who are casuals, and have my own team for competitive, neither of them are satisfied with this game. it doesn‚Äôt cater towards any group at all.

the lack of communication in most of the community 

really flawed competitive settings
(really a $100k tournament should NOT have been between so many players, they need another buffer to keep from lesser skilled players being farmed for points) 



yeah i get epic does things and i should appreciate them, which i have been doing for multiple seasons. but there‚Äôs a reason that every update something gets fixed, it‚Äôs because epic adds these problems in the first place. 

there‚Äôs no segregation of the playerbase, MANY problems could have been solved by adding a SEPARATE gamemode (not arena) that actually includes limitations, a certain item pool, and different rules. adding siphon to arena and taking it out of normal games isn‚Äôt a separation. 
arena could‚Äôve been so much more, we could‚Äôve had a green+ drops only, siphon rules, 100% spawnrate for every vehicle, either a tweak or removal of hamsterballs, no/tweaked heavy sniper, no/tweaked rpg, no/tweaked clingers,  and much more. 



epic needs to realize that many careers bounced off fortnite, many players QUIT jobs and even school for competing, and they don‚Äôt give much in return other than a big prize pool. 

it‚Äôs like my ex, i threw my life away for garbage.

Fortnites Twitch numbers have been dropping significantly the last two months.

People are quitting left and right.  Why?  Because the game simply isn't reliably fun for a large percentage of people anymore.  

The real reason why Fortnite is dying is because Epic took the game in a competitive direction rather than focusing on fun.  Fortnite used to be a story generator.  Players used to be able to say ""Jump on this rocket.  I'll fly you over to..."".  Players don't experience those organic, wacky, fun moments anymore because Epic decided to focus on ESports.  

If Battle Royale has RNG baked into it's DNA.  ESports is always going to but up against it.

How does Epic fix the decline?

Drop ESports after the World Cup, and focus on making the game fun for everyone again.  High level players will complain because they're mostly dumb, but they'll keep coming back because fun is fun.",FortNiteBR

The excavation site at Dusty Divot and the heat vents popping up shows there is lava underneath the map, proving there's more to the volcano than what we've seen so far. 

Tier 62 of the battle pass has a spray titled ""The End"" with an image displaying the words THE END IS NIGH"" and tier 62 is a banner of a cockroach which we've yet to see a skin for (probably a encrypted skin or the Discovery mystery skin) and cockroaches can survive nuclear fallout which makes them indicative of a catastrophe. 

There's a Mayan theme with Sunny Steps which historically had an apocalyptic undertone as a culture (they all vanished mysteriously) 

And the military helicopter going from place to place around the map, pointing towards the ""Fortnite government"" being active and scouting for some as of right now unknown reason. 

That's the most I can gather so far. My prediction is the volcano erupting in a future live event and creating a serious change on the map and POIs leading into next season which I hope will have an apocalyptic Mad Max fury road style theme.

It's colourful, there's always new updates and it's super competitive. But does it ever occur to you that they have made literally billions and fail to make an update without the most abnoxious bugs.

I believe they do it on purpose as a marketing technique. We get dopamine from getting around a bug and then they remove it, which takes some time getting used to and there's a new bug we have to deal with.

They UNDOUBTEDLY give streamers better connection, and better bloom. I believe they do the same with higher payers too, deeming it pay to win.

They don't care about your enjoyment. They want you to get addicted, buy all of these stupid skins that cost wayyy too much, and leech off you.

I'm not telling anybody to stop playing, I am continuing to play it myself but I have found myself fucked over so many times when a build doesn't place or when the enemies bloom is 10x better and it really erks me.

Just be aware that there's other games, arguably better, so if you get pissed off at the game being shit (because 35% at least it is) just turn the shit off. ",FortNiteBR

Get this through your stupid little heads... you ‚Äòmatter‚Äô... but you don‚Äôt ‚Äòmatter matter‚Äô. A developer will not cater to some egotistical streamers. Crying over resolution changes is ludicrous. Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have been cutting corners in the first place, especially when those corners were unfair in a game where casual and competitive people compete cross-platform.

You‚Äôve been playing with an advantage and now everyone is forced into the same view, which is the only way to level things out. Nobody cares that you‚Äôve grinded a stretched resolution and gotten better that way. Play the game native, the way it should be played, and stop blaming a gaming company because you took the easy way out in getting better at a free game they‚Äôve given you.

Next on the docket, Fortnite isn‚Äôt going to die, or at least not any time soon. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many of you losers say it will. There are tens of millions of people playing this game and the vast majority of them aren‚Äôt whiny clowns, and play this game for fun. If you‚Äôre a pro player, which is such a loose term in this game it‚Äôs not even funny, then your only job is to adapt and play. You don‚Äôt dictate the rules or settings and you never will.

If you‚Äôre too fragile, or your ego is so big that you think the most successful game on the planet will make changes because ‚Äòyou say so‚Äô, then you‚Äôre even dumber than the choice you made to play video games professionally.

All you entitled babies want is easy farming, more mat space, easy to use shotguns, tons of shield, and a game with 0 bugs. All the while complaining about vehicles, snipers, or anything that makes you think outside of your comfort zone.

That‚Äôs not how this works nor will it ever. You seem to treat Fortnite more like a deathmatch game as opposed to a battle royale game, and this is where the major flaw lies with sweaty and tryhard players. What you guys don‚Äôt seem to grasp is that there should be mobility, storm threats, limited building, and an array of different skill levels of players targeting you with a myriad of weapons. 

No casual player feels sorry for you. None of us give a shit if you get sniped in the end game of a bit money tournament. It‚Äôs fair, it‚Äôs even. Only pros would complain about things that are not in the game, while complaining about things that are in the game, when the changes they want would fuck this game up beyond playability.

Nobody wants to watch 40 players end game, turtling up and tunneling. No one is impressed by your edits and 90s and if anything is making the game stale and unplayable it‚Äôs you. 

Streamers, pros, people who think that because they play this 14 hours a day that their voice is louder than anyone else... YOU are the problem. You‚Äôre ruining the game and that‚Äôs literally all there is to this.

We‚Äôd all be happy to see you clowns go. So all the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done‚Äù talk is exactly what the community needs. The game doesn‚Äôt and never did need you to get where it is, no matter how many times you barf that idea up.",FortNiteBR

I think a lot of people just assumed many of the pros and content creators were decent people, but I don't think we can make that argument anymore. 

You have many streamers and pros purposefully smurfing on Arena, creating multiple fake accounts all because they can't stand not stomping bots. The first divisions are purposefully for the worst players in the game but they take pleasure in just mindlessly ruining their experience. On stream no less.

Then there is this whole stretched res stuff, which has exposed many of these people to be crybabies and even somewhat loony. I've had people argue with me that stretched res ""provides no advantage"" and that people were using it literally for the aesthetics. That's how desperate they are to excuse their behavior. 

We all know stretched was cancer. It was a meme. It looked horrible for viewers (especially in tournaments), and provided a clear unfair advantage. Now there's pros losing their minds all because they have to play like normal, like how console players have played since day one. 

Other changes have made otherwise ""rational"" players go into tailspins, claim that Epic is ruining their game, ranting and raving with clear unbalanced anger on their streams, people punching desks and claiming the great people at Epic have ""mental problems"" (not going to expose who said that gem). Whining on endless tweets about how the game is ""unplayable"" - even though it's exactly the same as it's ever been, if we're being realistic. 

The Fortnite community is in a poor state. Just depressing baby rants from grown adults, and teenage pros acting like the literal sky is falling because they can't play their game on with an aspect ratio that makes it look like we're back in the 90s. 

How did things become so toxic? And the real question is, are there any decent content creators left who aren't dirt bags or whiny children? ",FortNiteBR

But, see a soccer skin with the scythe pickaxe, Take the L, and the shield back bling...you know you're about to die.

Everyone is always making jokes about them always being so sweaty. (I like the joke and its my honest opinion that they're sweaty.)
Some people make posts probably saying ""look at this sweat"", and in the video, the person is in Solo, Duos, or Squads, and its almost always a soccer skin that shows up ready for a 30 kill game.

Now, people should go into playground to mine at the excavation sites. (Did I use the right word...?)
In public matches, thats when its a Battle Royale. The point of a Battle Royale is to be the last person standing. 

You must be the last person standing to win, not spam 90s and kill 35 people. Sure, its kinda fun to get those many kills and some people like a challenge, but now you got TTVs with soccer skins building 90s to the International Space Station on SOMEONE WHOS NEW TO THE GAME.

So in my opinion, soccer skins are sweaty. Maybe theres a possibility that some aren't...I doubt it.

We cannot just complain. Let's do some brainstorming about this complete outrage of patch 8.20.

I have put a lot of thinking into the past Fortnite update, 8.20, affecting material and health gain upon elimination in Fortnite Battle Royale, and I think I have found the best solution/compromise. Here it is, take a gander-

1. Upon an elimination, the player receives 20 health points.
2. Upon an elimination, the player receives a **SLURP JUICE EFFECT** of another 30 health. So, overall the health gained is still 50, except this way, it registers a little slower.
3. Upon an elimination, the player receives 20 of each material.
4. Upon an elimination, the player receives 30 slowly regenerating materials, using the same **SLURP JUICE EFFECT** seen in the LTM, floor is lava, where the player's materials were constantly slowly regenerating. I hope epic uses this **same** game mechanic for a kill reward that the community has been craving since the patch, and I think this idea still will heavily help what Epic's overall goal is: helping bad players stick with the game.

(which is fine, just annoying from the perspective of a highly skilled player; epic is allowed to do that to help keep their profits high)

DEAR EPIC.

Patch 8.20 did not achieve what you wanted: keeping new players safe, which in the long run keeps the game healthy. Good players still SHIT on bad players, that will never change. If a player is better than its opponent significantly, that good player will still beat their opponent. This will never change, no matter the **game** or **circumstance.** Hopefully with these tweaks, the game will stay playable for the advanced players like myself who is very frustrated with Fortnite's current state, and will remain enjoyable for casual players, who are just here to have a fun time, play with their friends and maybe buy a couple skins.

Please take into consideration these changes.

While they are trying to shoot you they are crouched trying to retain minimal bloom making them an easy target to snipe.

An example would be when its last two teams are fighting and TEAM 1 is positioned in a cluster near each other and TEAM 2 has two flanks shaped like an L around TEAM 1. 

One flank of TEAM 2 is shooting one angle on TEAM 1. The TEAM 1 sniper has cover from TEAM 2‚Äôs flank applying pressure and is hard scoping TEAM 2‚Äôs other flank. 

The flank from TEAM 2 can‚Äôt shoot at the sniper to apply pressure back or peak because the sniper is hardscoping and if he is a good sniper its an easy knock if the player peaks to shoot.

Even if the player being sniped at switches positions they peek from they can‚Äôt shoot more than once or twice without that sniper aiming at them.

The balance is that if you take damage while scoped you should be forced to de-scope. That way snipers can‚Äôt force high reward, low risk trades.

2. Minigun. I think it goes without saying that the minigun is either ridiculously annoying or spam worthy, virtually useless in solos. I wouldn‚Äôt mind this gun staying in squads but I almost NEVER see anybody pick the gun up during a regular solo match unless it‚Äôs the first chest they opened. 

3. The infantry rifle and/or the AK. I despise both of these weapons and they‚Äôre pretty similar in terms of fire rate and damage. They‚Äôre both hard hitting yet very inconsistent weapons that will piss you off more often than not with their bloom.

4. The mounted turret. It suffers the same fate as a minigun except being a harder hit. It doesn‚Äôt help that the damn gun itself gets in the way of most shots that you‚Äôre aiming at the person. I‚Äôve noticed that during end game, if somebody is spamming a turret, *nobody* will try to stop them unless it‚Äôs the person who‚Äôs getting shot at. Either folks are too scared to engage or they let somebody else spam away and turn a blind eye. It‚Äôs a very nooby trap and most good players don‚Äôt use it, it‚Äôs just something that‚Äôll frustrate you more often than it‚Äôll make you satisfied. 

5. The hand cannon. I might be in the minority here but I simply do not like the hand cannon. I feel like my shots never hit when they‚Äôre supposed to and hit when they‚Äôre not. Maybe it‚Äôs just me but the gun isn‚Äôt very useful and even less so since it was completely overpowered for a short period of time. The gun is something I prefer to stay away from and isn‚Äôt something I see that‚Äôs used often, nonetheless worthy of its epic and legendary status.

307,TheSpicyRamen,1554349653,b97vdi,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b97vdi/the_last_straw/,2,The Last Straw,"I‚Äôve been playing fortnite almost everyday since my friends convinced me to try it back in early season 2.  I‚Äôve been following epic through all the ups and downs.  This game has given me some of my most memorable moments I‚Äôve had playing video games.  Fortnite is definitely my favorite game of all time.

However, these recent changes show how little epic cares about their dedicated fans, not the players who follow the hype and leave once a new game comes out, but the players that keep a game alive many years after its peak.  They do not care about the content creators that made this game the biggest success in gaming history.  They do not care about pros who have sunk hours every single day in an attempt to one, allow fortnite to HAVE a competitive scene, and to improve and become the best of the best.

There have been many changes over the past few months that have served the sole purpose of making the game less skill based and more rn rng based.  I will be focusing on the removal of the changes in 7.4 and the banning of stretched res in comp games.

7.4 changes were great all around.  It rewarded people who utilized the skill gap (building, editing, etc.).  It lessened the affects of 3rd parting, and it made games a lot more fast paced and enjoyable.  I already know the biggest complaint about them is that it made ‚Äúthe really good players almost unkillable‚Äù however in my experience it also made it much easier to improve at the game.  I‚Äôll use myself as an example, I swapped to pc in mid January this year, and with no prior pc gaming experience I feel like I have made massive strides at improving as a pc player.  Me and my duo partner (who switched to pc around the same time as me) just cracked 200+ points in the arena and still climbing.  I guarantee that me and my friend would have never improved as fast as we did if there wasn‚Äôt the siphon and mat changes.  For bad players that wanted to improve, the changes were the best thing because it allowed you to use and practice the skills gap more often.

My second complaint is the changes to stretch res.  I know that they did this to try and bridge the gap between console and pc, but this was not the way to do it, an easy change that would‚Äôve only made the game better would‚Äôve been to add an fov slider in game.  For people like poach, who have been playing on stretched for almost as long as they‚Äôve been playing the game, it is a piece of shit move from epic to get rid of stretched res 10 days before the biggest tournament yet.  I truly believe that epic games is an incompetent company after these changes, they do nothing but hurt the game and the community.  Sacrificing your dedicated fans to farm and milk the most casual players for all their worth is a recipe to have your game die, because eventually the big streamers and content creators will have had enough and they will leave, and once they do all those casuals you fought so desperately hard to retain will leave too.

These changes were the last straw for me, I don‚Äôt care if I get downvoted to reddit hell, I am done with this game and with this company, they‚Äôve made too many terrible changes for me to continue supporting them.",FortNiteBR

-Battle pass with the best skins, taunts, and more so new players get a chance to get older cosmetics (a vignette or compilation of said items)

-Double pump is back

-999 Mats

-All weapons introduced later are vaulted and all vaulted weapons in that season are unvaulted (chance to use zapatron at least once)

-Rarities will be adjusted as well as the removal of purple and gold pumps (the biggest sacrifices take the greatest will -thanos)

-STW will also be fixed for those who care

-Menu and UI will remain the same (lobby and shit)

-Will edit if I can think of more, leave suggestions

This one might be a stretch, but we could have 3 different maps, 1 for each season. this would also have the really nostalgic cartoon feel along with the font of the text.

Note: Sprays, Music, Skins released 4 and onwards will still be available for use and in shop. this applies to bug patches as well.

Overall, this would be beneficial to Fortnite because seasoned players get the tingle of nostalgia and new players get to experience the past. This gives the old players a way to reestablish a connect with old players so they know why they started playing in the first place. Think of the streamers like ninja, this might trigger the inner NinjasHyper in him. New players will, again, get the chance to experience the aged fortnite and unlock the cosmetics they didn‚Äôt have the chance to get.

please leave your opinion below, if you agree, comment below. I would love to see your suggestions and responses 

Cheers,
Zauhn

Lower your 3D resolution. Lowering up to 20% won't make the game ugly. Source: Using 900p on 1080p.

&gt;Everyone could do it so it was an even playing field!

If something only counters itself, it's overpowered. And not everyone will go out of their way to mess on in-game files to have an advantage. Seeing the top of a very tall building without looking up is a massive competitive advantage.

Lately there have been a **lot** of horrible changes being made to the game that, about a week or two ago, was super enjoyable to play every day. 

I'm going to start off by saying I started my fortnite career in stretched resolution. I started season 2, I saw a professional player stretch his screen and see a lot more above and around him and I tried it myself. It is now season 8, and since then I have never played Native in my life.   
I'm now sitting looking at what I think is native, but I can't exactly tell. Contemplating what I do. Whether or not I quit the game entirely or try and learn an entirely new way to play.  
Just this past weekend, I got into the finals for the luxe cup, and got 70th place with my friend in all of NAW. I was so proud and super excited to see how well I could do during the worldcup.

I need this change reverted. More than any, or else me, a bunch of friends or people I know, and most importantly professional players, who made the game as popular and competitive as it is, will quit.

Lastly... I'm a growing twitch streamer(slowly but surely), and fortnite was my main game that I streamed. I was noticed by some smaller organizations, as well as some larger streamers, and I'm worried this change will ruin that entire community growth for me.

This is my story of the game, and if any of you feel the same or have any sympathy, help me get this into the eyes of epic games, with your stories as well, so we can fix this game-ruining change.

Thank you!

(P.S. I'd love to hear your personal stories in the comments)",FortNiteBR

PAX, first LAN every player is forced to play native on epic settings, Twitch con, zombies, redeploy and moving zones added to the game the day before the event, winter royale, sword added the day of na finals, ESL, new season the same day as the event completely screwing some players. And now you remove stretched 2 weeks before world cup qualifiers. Its clear that competitive is just a marketing tool, but the pro players aren't going to keep going much longer.

I honestly doubt that epic even knows about the automatic input lag that you get when you play on console. For that reason alone the skillgap between console/pc will always be way to high for console players to have a chance at keeping up with pc at a high level. Just seperate the lobbies for console competetive. At some point you guys have to actually be educated on the mediums of your game because honestly it seems like you have no clue about how the actual hardware that consoles have, effects the game.

You give them a new gun and they are automatically doing insane trick shots and stacking kills as usual, so I believe most people complaining are guys who hate change just for the sake of it. 

Let Epic do the stuff they think will balance the game, this sub is not 100% the player base of Fortnite and they know it, I believe they are watching their data and it seems that is not as bad as most people led to believe by continuously ranting here saying they will kill the game.

Ghosting is not professional and not giving us a good reason as to why they are doing this changes is something that will piss people off. 

Everything before 8.20 was perfect besides performance issues, but the game was in a good state (besides ballers), guns were balanced, mechanics were great, but now the game is going downhill.

What happened to their last game? Ohh yeah, they stopped caring what the community wanted for the game completely and Paragon is a dead game, did Epic not learn? I'm not saying they need to add everything the community wants, but they need to listen too.

&amp;#x200B;

Look at Destiny 1, I was a fan of that game, Bungie slowly stopping giving f--s about what the community wanted and the game became terrible at the end. Look at destiny 2, they ignored everything the community liked from Destiny 1 and the game is trash. Unnecessary changes with no statement from them is annoying.",FortNiteBR

Really disappointed with how the game is rn. Feels like Epic is turning to a company like EA where all they care about is a group of select players instead of pleasing the entire community. 

The world cup is around the corner but with these servers, might as well call it ""Half-world cup"" because only the NA and EU can properly compete.

hi there,

i have been a long time DotA 2 gamer. Actually a PC gamer btw. 

i wanted to try out different stuff and downloaded this game. However, i can't seem to figure out how this game is supposed to be played as a fresh player.

 In DotA 2, you get an option to practice against bots, watch the tutorial in order to learn the basics. But, i haven't seen any such thing helpful in this game despite watching plenty of tutorial videos on Youtube and tracking a few game guides. 

  any ideas?

 i am quite confused about binding the keys for construction as well. Which keys are more proper for this?  

 Which game mode would suit me more as a fresh player? 

 Thanks in advance.",FortNiteBR

To set the optimal graphics for my built, I first put everything at epic. Was able to get a 80 fps constant. CPU usage was at like 50%. Then, i tried everything at low (except viewing distance) and i was getting a great 180 fps. However, CPU usage was now at 80%! Due to this incrase, my overall CPU usage was often at 100% which would create lag spikes.

After some testing to optimize (a word still unknowns by epic dev) the game for my PC, I determined that setting the shadow at high was better because my CPU is never fully loaded and I can get a constant 120fps with no lag spike due to a CPU overstressed.

How is this even possible? I'm I alone with this? This may explain why they don't give the option to remove shadows on consoles too?

I have an I5 7500 with 16gb of ram.",FortNiteBR

There's a new Outfit in the Item Shop, your not really sure if you would like it, you think you would like it so you buy it, but after a while... you begin too dislike it, and it was a waste of your precious V-Bucks stolen from your moms credit card, but what if?... this wasn't the case?

Introducing, the Testing Room!

![img](ip7r3cmogsn21)

So here's how it works, there would be an option underneath buy that would say something like ""Test Outfit"", ""Test Back bling"", Test Items"", ""Test Harvesting Tool"", etc. The button would teleport you too the place in this image. (This is just my example)

So lets take a tour through the testing room,

![img](chqmv6mzgsn21)

This is the spawn area, you can walk around it and simply explore the environment with the item your considering too buy. You can't build or break stuff, however if it is a Harvesting Tool  you are considering on buying you can hear the sound it makes when breaking.

Welcome too the Weapon Roster- or Deck as I prefer too call it. The Deck includes every weapon that is currently available in Normal LTM's. (Solo, Duo, Squad, Team Rumble, etc) There are no Vaulted Weapons in the Deck. The purpose of the Deck is too be able too select Weapons in the event you wan't too purchase a Weapon Wrap. Weapons are categorized by Rarity and Weapon type. (And before you say it, yes, the Infintry Rifle counts as an Assault Rifle and not a Sniper)

So that is the end of our tour around the Testing Room. In case you really wan't I attached an about 4 minute clip of me walking around the farm just too get a feel for the atmosphere. Thank you for reading, and have a nice rest of your day or night. :)

&amp;#x200B;

I for some reason only prefer to buy the ""sweaty"" skins now, or what's generally labeled as such. It's not that I'm trying to fit in with the crowd. I don't just buy a skin because it's ""sweaty"", but for some reason the ones I ended up liking after a year of playing were the more simplistic ones. (examples would be: recon specialist, bullseye, snorkel ops). 

&amp;#x200B;

I have the Fate skin, which is probably the only ""tryhard"" legendary skin I can think of. I remember loving the male/legendary skins when I was a noob to this game. The male fortnite model just does not look good and for some reason is tied to a bad player. (most black knights I run into are bots).

&amp;#x200B;

Then there are some skins that you can just tell ""wow that's a sweaty skin"" - this would be something like Shadow Ops. Not something you see a lot, but the first thing that crosses your mind when you see a shadow ops is ""wow this guy looks sweaty af"". Same goes for munitions expert and of course the skin we all know about...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I bought Skully because I think she looks awesome. A new, original looking female model with an extra selectable style. This is probably one of those outlier skins that I really like, that may not be considered a sweat skin. Let me know what you guys think of Skully's sweatiness though! I have not run into many in game so far.

So hearing directionally can be quite difficult some times, or at the very least take a lot longer to figure it out. The audio visualizer that was added is very interesting,  but it doesn't have a lot of merit on its own.  He doesn't use it mainly because you can't distinguish certain sounds, like guns from one another, or if footsteps are above or below. The only thing I can propose to fix or help people with this problem would either be to update the audio visualizer with up and down arrows for footprints and chests, or allow audio visualizer to be used with sound on. Honestly I don't think the second option would be a problem, because if everyone on every platform can do it, then it's not an advantage right? Just leveling the playing field. 

Tl;Dr  audio visualizer needs updates for spatialization, or it needs to be able to be used with sound on. (An option for everyone obviously,  no advantages here, only leveling the playing field).",FortNiteBR

In close range, while it is more effective than other snipers, it‚Äôs a sniper, so therefore it definitely sucks at close ranges. When u get the gun u should definitely use it at a medium range as it is (if used properly) a laser due to the bloom of this gun being incredible when holding down right click. But if u get this gun as your first and there‚Äôs people all around u you‚Äôre kinda screwed. Immediately go and try to find another gun as this gun is complete garbage at close range, due to it being a sniper rifle. To say that this gun is terrible is in my opinion, kinda false, as it is really damn good at the right moments and really terrible at the worst moments, but every sniper is just like that.  I personally think this gun is good as it takes skill to generally use this correctly and when done is generally pretty damn good at lasering people!

The Heavy Sniper: is a snipers and snipers are supposed to deal great damage to players when hit. Just get good with it and its a really good weapon.

The Rocket Launcher: The rocket launcher is an explosive and last time i checked Fortnite only has 2 Explosive weapons. these things are very rare too. so chances of coming across someone with this is slim because they only spawn in vending machines or Supply Drops. Also the rocket launcher an easily be countered with a wall. you know those things that takes like less than a second to build. if you have a problem with this weapon you probably should not play Fortnite

Assault Rifle: Saw a post about this weapon so here we go. The Ar is like the only mid range gun in the game. Everyone needs an Ar. Also the Damn Thing has like 30 bullets in a clip and you can hold of someone spamming an Ar for a little before you get close. 

Moral of the story stop asking epic to vault or nerf something just because YOU have a problem with it.

Also everything can be countered with building",FortNiteBR

My brother loves the game and literally dedicates his life to it.  He is 19, since graduating high school he hasn‚Äôt started a job or college, he doesn‚Äôt stream. He isn‚Äôt trying to go anywhere in life other than getting better at fortnite. 

He has repeatedly said that he won‚Äôt be looking for a job since it would take time away from him getting better. A month ago me and him were playing and he got mad cause we died to a guy (who destroyed us) and I said he just played it better than us. He threatened to not play with me anymore if I didn‚Äôt acknowledge he was better than the guy who killed both of us. I obviously refused cause dude played well. 

Pan to now, we don‚Äôt play together anymore because I realized what the game is doing to him so I stopped playing the game altogether. He is finding new duo partners and plays even more than before.

Just talked to my mom who he lives with and he told her that his way of living is just as valid as anyone who has a job, since he doesn‚Äôt care about money. He feels that since my parents are willing to support him, he doesn‚Äôt need a job, and straight up lashes out if anyone tries to mention his addiction or that his way of life is in any way worse than theirs. 

I know the easy answer is for my parents to give him an ultimatum, but they never will just because of who they are. He is getting worse, and has gone from a nice kid, to someone who is rude and irrational. Any advice for me on how to help him, or am I overplaying this in my head and you guys think I‚Äôm the crazy one?",FortNiteBR

1. Early game. Ammo is scarce and you most likely started off with a low tier weapon. Let‚Äôs say you have 17 shots in your common ar and then you find a purple scar. You pick up the scar plus the extra 10 bullets it comes with so now you‚Äôre at 40. Being able to unload the ammo from the other ar might just make the difference in your early game success. 

2. Late game/scorch and burn. Let‚Äôs say you have an all gold load out except for your purple pump and suddenly you come across a gold pump. You pick it up and leave your purple one behind. Obviously, you don‚Äôt want your enemies to have that. So, the ability to unload it would give you the extra ammo and force your enemies to load it if they want to pick it up. 

Also, unloading your weapon would take the same amount of time it takes to load it. ",FortNiteBR

167,Adam200x,1553289934,b4aovs,18,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b4aovs/constant_complaining/,8,Constant Complaining,"I have been playing Fortnite for almost a year now and I recently discovered Reddit. I thoroughly enjoy reading the opinions and suggestions of the community but I cannot help but notice the constant complaining of some players regarding the so-called try-hards. First of all, the term try-hard, which is used to describe a a player who apparently 'sweats' in order to win, makes absolutely no sense. From what I've read, it seems that some people get angry when they get killed by another better player and they claim they do not have fun anymore because everyone plays like there is money on the line. Stop for a moment, try to comprehend what they are complaining about. The problem for them is that people are trying to win in a battle royale game. This mentality is flawed, as I do not understand what better players are supposed to do. Let the worse player win? Do not improve? I guarantee you that fortnite would be dead if it was the same as season 1 when noone built. People adapted, learned and became better. Fortnite became more competitive which prolonged the longevity of the game significantly. Of course, not all players had the time and will to improve. This resulted in them constantly getting outplayed by someone better. I understand that it is frustrating sometimes, but the solution is not to call others sweats and tryhards and give up on the game. As I stated before, I have been playing fortnite since season 3. My stats are still recovering from getting killed instantly for countless games. It wasnt until season 6 that I started to improve and increased my win ratio. Now I am happy for my progress and I am trying to improve even more. As a college student I only play on Friday and Saturday, but the lack of time does not stop me from doing the best that I can. There are countless videos, streamers and sites that help you improve as well. Playground, creative and large team modes are always there. My point is if somebody wants to get better he or she absolutely can. The people that complain in this sub all day should take the time and try to think what they did wrong in a fight or a game instead of coming here and post lengthy posts about how much they hate try hards. Please, for once think about how you can play better and improve. Everyone who plays battle royale tries to win so that, by your logic, would make you a try hard as well. If you dont care about wins and kills play the casual mode. It is hypocritical to judge and hate on people who try to win when you have the same goal. I have never seen a more entitled community, do you guys honestly think that somebody owes you a win? Nobody owes you anything whether it is the virtual or the real world. Get away from this toxic mentality of blaming everyone else but yourself for your mistakes,in order to feel better. In conclusion, it does not feel good when you get killed or lose a game, but the problem is not that other people are better. It is unreasonable to hate on someone who has put countless of hours to improve. If they enjoy that, let them be, dont come here and call them sweaty and no-life. I am by no means a god at this game but little by little I try to get better. If that's your goal too, hating is not gonna make you better. We, as a community, should focus on the real issues of the game whether they are bugs, balanced weapons or a proper ranked mode. ***** Thank you for your time, this is a long post i know :( . Please, excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes as English is not my first language. I am very happy to answer your comments and opinions. Have a great day!******",FortNiteBR

What if Epic made it so you would get a 1 minute penalty before joining another match if you quit too early, like say the time between spawning on spawn island to the first minute of the game (before the bus makes you auto jump out and land). No one should be disconnecting that early in the match. But if you are killed within this very first minute you can avoid this waiting time penalty for the players that legit just get killed early.

But heres the thing, me and my friend started playing the events thats been held on Fortnite. It may just be me and my luck, but we are dying over and over again, cause we don't find any kind of loot such as pumps, or something. We either get a grey pistol, or if we are lucky an uncommon one. This was not just 1 game, but 80% of our early to midgame have been like this. Im sick and bored of the RNG in this game, when enemys gets a golden pump or a scar. Its impossible to fight early game, and it happens everywhere. So why is the game so RNG based and the skill-gap has to be so small. I can't even drop into normal games without this happening too.

I've been PC gaming for about 10 years. I'm an ex R1 wow player and I typically played FPS on console until Overwatch &amp; Fortnite were released.

I have been playing Fortnite at 800 DPI with my X&amp;Y at 0.075. I would consider this Wrist aiming. Would you all agree?

Also, I have been going back and forth between sensitivities trying to find the perfect sens and it isn't easy tbh. 

Maybe that's because I switch it up too often..

At a lower sensitivity I find it a lot easier to hit shotgun shots, but the downside is building/edits and close up 180 shotgun shots are harder. At 0.075 I tend to over compensate a lot when aligning shots but my quick builds and edits are great. 

Would would you all suggest.. Sticking with 0.075 and slowly adjusting my sensitivity down or start low and adjust up?

Again, what do you all think the middle ground send is between wrist and aim?

Just because it‚Äôs not easy to use it doesn‚Äôt mean that IT doesn‚Äôt hit anything. It means that YOU don‚Äôt hit anything with it. 

It‚Äôs extremely accurate (by that I mean almost no bloom at all, only recoil), has very good damage, fast fire rate (although spamming fire isn‚Äôt something you should do with this weapon) and it has no damage drop off. 

Take your time to learn how it shoots instead of complaining about it. As I said it‚Äôs quite uncommon now so if you don‚Äôt like it just don‚Äôt use it. 
And before you say ‚Äúwhat if it‚Äôs the only thing you find when you drop‚Äù, keep in mind that luck is part of the battle royale genre. Just because you get a sniper when you land and the guy next to you gets a pump you‚Äôre not going to come and complain about snipers next, are you?

The bullet has travel time like snipers so you have to predict the enemy‚Äôs movement, but it barely has any bullet drop (if at all), so you don‚Äôt have to aim above the enemy (like you do with snipers).
The bullet hitbox is pretty big too, so once you‚Äôve learned how to use it, hitting you opponents really isn‚Äôt hard.

I know for a fact that there are people who enjoy using it and I personally will take an infantry rifle over any other assault rifle (except scar), as long as I also have something to take down structures.

&amp;#x200B;

Lately I've been having waaaay to much packet loss and constant ping spikes since they changed something with their ISP back in patch 8.10 -&gt;  (i believe). I remember they made a reddit post about it and described the situation with much details but now for some reason i cant seem to find that post, pretty sure they deleted it.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought it was my internet at first but after doing various test and calling my internet service provider everything seem fine. I was constantly having 160m (down) and 20m -&gt; stable connection.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah... Now i cant even play the game and this is how it goes:

1) get the desire to practice

2) open the game

3) get into a match to test the connection

4) it's running smoothly for the first minute

5) BOOM! Ping spike, get a lot of packet loss (notified with the wifi icon with the red upload and X symbol)

6) get disapointed

6) instantly close the game

7) wait couple days or for next patch

8) Repeat

I found this out using [this photo of a glitch in season 7](https://i.redd.it/c6v908tcjin21.jpg) (via u/imuncreative_)  and measurements in game. (I'm bored okay)

1 grid space is 250m. I found this out by putting a marker at one point on the grid, and standing at the other point. the new ping system, this was pretty easy to do.

There are 10 grid spaces on the map. 250x10 is 2,500m, which is about a mile and a half. So the length of the island is a mile and a half long. (Kind of underwhelming tbh)

I then scaled that multiple times to fit the photo of the world. [Pic is here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2PKz6rVYAA-X3W.jpg). As you can see, the world is 25x longer than the Fortnite island. 2,500x25 is 62500m. Converting it into miles gets us \~38.8 Miles.

If that sounds tiny, that's because it is. It can easily fit into the US state Delaware.

Suddenly epic sees a lot of complaints from bad switch players and decides to group us with mobile

This is completely unacceptable! Good players should have the option for who they random fill with. I‚Äôm so disappointed. I can‚Äôt afford a new console right now and I was really enjoying the game.....

My son loves fortnite like most soon to be 8 year olds. Getaway is by far his favorite mode. Ever since it returned he has had this idea to make it into a TV show.

At first I thought it was just a whim, but he's been insistent with his questions. At first he wanted to do an idea based on it. When his sister explained copyright he started asking me about copyright and if he could get a job at epic.

Some of the questions he's asked

* what kind of material should the gems be?
* should the shooting be paintball or laser tag style?
* how can we elevate the vans safely?
* what should be the prize money?

And a host of other questions.

He suggested doing it at an abandoned school, but I told him that's not a good idea considering the current climate son he suggested a warehouse setting which could look like the game

Tonight he told mom he wanted to record a video to send to Epic. This is one determined kid, so I figured i would help him out by sharing with some people who will get a kick out of it.

And while you can have agruments on ""Oh, don't go for the chest then,"" I think it'd be pretty neat to have Infantries taken out of chests.

Reasoning:
¬∑ Keeps them in the game. Some people like using them, and we as a community kind of have a ""it's amazing or it's vaulted"" mindset. This keeps the Infantries in the game, not vaulting, but still offers less chance to get them.
¬∑ You know what you're getting. You can see floor loot; even while gliding you can sort of make it out. This means you won't get an Infantry Rifle first gun unless you choose to.
¬∑ Keeps the drop rate less. While removing the gray variant was great, you still see a few every now and then. I want to keep the Rifles still accessible to those who want them, but not too common so everyone gets them.

My last remaining Fortnite friend stopped playing Fortnite in Season 7.  All my other Fortnite friends stopped playing in Season 6.

Why?

Because all of us worked 9 - 5 jobs, and we started getting rolled by no life sweats on a more and more consistent basis.  The game went from ""We can win if we play smart and get a little lucky"" to ""We can win if we avoid all fights and 3rd party the last two remaining teams/players"".

That's not fun for casual players.  We all play games to...wait for it...have fun.

Here's the evidence of Fortnites decline.

https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=%2Fm%2F0k9bc90

Regular modes as well as the Guantlet Cups still pit players who drop 20+ kills in matches with players who don't know how to build.  Getting rolled by significantly better players isn't fun.  No one wants to come home from work and play 5 matches of Fortnite in a row without getting a single kill.  That regularly happens for a lot of players now (until they quit).  It didn't happen nearly as frequently back in Seasons 1 - 4.

Epic has two options.  Either separate players based on skill level (largely based on KD and win rate) or add more RNG to the game so bad players have a better shot.

Time is ticking.  That Google Trends chart is only going to keep dropping unless Epic starts thinking about the casual player.",FortNiteBR

Another theory regarding Fortnite BR's Storyline.,"I recently took a look *back in time,* and kinda just put on paper everything the Fortnite Island has gone through. What I have come to realise- was that it followed a pattern. Actually, a *double-sided* pattern.

&amp;#x200B;

***Important Note:*** This theory has nothing to do with The Cube, therefore with the entire Season 6, as I believe the stoy of The Cube is exclusively Battle-Royale-specific (also links with STW). I am going to cover the similiraties between our actual history timeline and the timeline of the changes of the island.

&amp;#x200B;

***Another Important Note:*** From what I have gathered, every Tier 1 Battle Pass Skin represents the skin that best describes the upcoming events of the current season, as well as the era the season takes place in.

&amp;#x200B;

Ordering events by the Fornite timeline, they go as follow:

&amp;#x200B;

**Season 2**

* the main characters are knights, whose flowering as a fashion in the high nobility date from as late as the 15th century.
* this is the origin of the Fortnite timeline.

&amp;#x200B;

**Season 3**

* the main characters are astronauts, humans who try to conquer space in the 19th century.

&amp;#x200B;

**Season 4**

* the main characters are... normal people? Exactly. Normal people who became actors and star in superhero movies. These types of blockbusters gained popularity in the early 21st century. (Detectives also play an important role this season)
* the event that started it all was the **Rocket Launch event**\- the Visitor's Rocket created **the first rift**, who essentially expanded and then *broke* space and time, leading up to a series of anomallies, such as interdimensional traveling, timetraveling or even... inverting the normal follow-up of events, as seen in the real world. - I like to call it the Fortnite Big Bang.

# Season 5- Worlds Collide

* once again, we see Drift as the Tier 1 Skin- a normal human being who was transported in the Fortnite-verse by a rift. (present time)
* after the creation of the rift, multiple objects belonging to the real world also appeared in Fortnite. 
* at this moment, the gap between the two universe was at an all-time low. From this moment on, it would then again start to widen.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, it's time for a history class! Buckle up! It's important to mention that starting with Season 6, the timeline is inverted (e.g. normally it would go S8, S7, S6). So, Season 5 was obviously the point of maximum evolution in Fortnite, and from that point on, we all started to go back in time... to Cowboys, Ice Explorers and Pirates.

&amp;#x200B;

**Season 6**

* our journey back in time starts with Calamity- a cowgirl that is representative to the 19th century, As I stated earlier, she isn't all that important. *(sad yee-haw)*

**Season 7**

* this entire season is the equivalent of the Little Ice Age (1300-1870)- a period of prodigious coldness that has stricken the Earth.
* the Little Ice Age was originally caused by the frequent and powerful volcanic eruptions that were happening (keep that in mind)

**Season 8**

* we got Pirates! These almighty bucaneers started filling the seas around the 16th century.
* we got Ninja-Dragons! Ninjas were popular in the 12th-15th centuries.
* we got a volcano! Knowing that the eruption of such a massive volcano would mean the deep slumber also known as the Little Ice Age, it is very safe to say it's going to happen soon.
* we got Sunny Steps! a.k.a. Machu Picchu, who was civilized around the 15th century as well.

&amp;#x200B;

[Fortnite's timeline](https://i.redd.it/7lgyp73jn7s21.jpg)

Therefore, I shall now predict that in S9 the volcano is going to errupt violently, followed by a sudden shrinking- sign that it would just then start growing and the ice is going to melt, since the Little Ice Age only starts in the 13th century, and S9 would take place earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

**Important note:** What about Vikings?- you may ask yourselves. Welp, the answer is not so simple. If we take a look back (or further idk) to Season 5, when they were introduced, they didn't play any role whatsoever, they just bought the Viking Village and then dipped. That is because, the Viking Village's appearance was caused by the rift in the sky, along with the carriage in the desert and the other not-so-random objects. Only in Season 8 (15th-16th century) are we seeing the vikings' presence in-game. And that is because it actually matches with the correct order of events: Vikings played a major role in Europe during the 8th-11th centuries, and later started raiding villages until they finally went extinct (exactly what's happening around Snobby Shores nowadays). Vikings' arcs are just now started developping. In season 5, they were simply harbingers of doom (r/punpatrol), just as Norse legends tell us. In fact, they were harbingers of the event that got us in a trip back in time, more so.

So, normally, the vikings would play an even bigger role when we get to their era, in S9 or S10, I reckon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Linked Theory:** King Arthur and the almighty Excalibur Sword took the world by storm in the 6th century. Maybe this has something to do with the Polar Peak castle and the chairs around the table from the throne room? We'll have to wait and see! Most probably, the Kings/Queens will be unveiled to us until that time, as we already have the Sword.

There are no sweats, just the skill ceiling has increased throughout the seasons and if you have every battle pass tier 100, it makes no sense that somehow you fell behind the avg skill or how good you were in S2, playing the same amount of time every season.

People got better, but you stayed bad.

It's boring as hell, I'd much rather watch streamers play pubs any day than competitive. 

It was fun the first tournaments watching 40 players in the last circles building and editing but now it just got old, at least for me. Maybe they should change the scoring system (1 point per kill and 10 for a VR just incentivizes camping as long as possible).

The problem with the balls right now is that people are just camping low ground or flying like crazy - without any risks!  
\- I think that the balls only should be used as a mobility item, not a free top 10 item.  
= So the fix could be that the balls should break/take high storm damage. Maybe 50 health pr. sek. (4 sek. for the balls to break).  
This could make people go out of the balls before the storm gets too small, and minimize the abuse of the ballers.

What do you all think? Could this be a solution, or will it make no difference?

Ok, I don’t get the IMMENSE hype surrounding Cizzorz’s death runs. It just seems ridiculous to me. The first one was like ‘Ok, that’s cool, a little parkour speed run competition’ but this concept has been milked so much and has turned into a kind of common name within Fortnite Creative community. 

My first point is that the death runs are near-impossible for most normal players to complete. Each time a new death run is released by this guy, everyone gets super hyped and jumps on it straight away, but it is super hard... You must have to be in the top ~10% players to be able to complete these courses, and less than 1% will even be minutes within the record time by the end of the competition. 

Secondly, the maps take little to no effort to create. I received a creator code for building maps around 5 months ago and since have hugely participated in the Fortnite Creative community. I’ve published 6 maps SOLO; all of which have taken tens of hours of work. On the other hand, Cizzorz has a team helping him and the builds are insanely monotonous and plain. The only effort in these maps is the large scale involved in the creation. Now, I’m not saying that these maps NEED to be visually pleasing, but I’ve seen people refer to him as a ‘Creative God’. It only takes a couple minutes of watching ‘Bludrive’ on YouTube to be convinced otherwise. 

Lastly, Cizzorz wants it to be this way. He may not have intended for it to take off like this, but is definitely happy with what it has become. He wants to create this aura of hype surrounding his work which most wont even complete. He wants it like this because he can, and does make insane money off of this. Last I heard, he was around 3 million supporters in the SAC program. If each of those people spent 1,000 V Bucks, he would make approximately (0.5 x 3mil) $1.5 million. That is insane. In a 4x creator event he would maybe rack up over $6 million. This is crazy. And this is perfect for him.

To conclude, I think that this hype around the death run idea is ridiculous and over rated. I just played the ‘Fun Run’, and have to say it was the antithesis on fun. These maps are low effort, mass produced and are money making machines. Just how the creators want them.",FortNiteBR

I personally prefer the arena style with the health and mats on kill and just the general competitive nature of having points and what not. 

What I don’t understand is that as an Xbox player, if I want to play this mode, or competitive in general, why do I have to play with people on the computer? It should be no surprise to anyone on this subreddit that the game does not preform very well on the Xbox. You can see a very reoccurring theme of posts on this subreddit, where every time there is a ‘Bug’ post on this sub, 9/10 times it is a console. Go check it out if you don’t believe me. It has been that way since the beginning. My point is not really geared towards my grievance about Console performance, but more so about the various advantages that people who play on computer get, that console doesn’t. 

Here’s a short list of advantages that computer players get over console players.

- Resolution Options &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; stretched = OP
- Graphics/better render distances/graphics options 
- Deadzones 
-  input lag
-  FPS 

Then there’s also the point of how much easier it is to Aim and move around on KBM as opposed to sticks, but that’s common knowledge really. And before you, and Epic themselves has said about the whole cross play situation: 

“Don’t NICMERKS, Ghost Ayden, FaZe Sway play on controller and compete with the best of the world? So you can do it too!” 

Guess what they do? Plug a controller into a PC. Then they get to enjoy the peak performance and all its benefits, and good for them. They should play with PC people because they get to enjoy all the perks of having the computer. They have their custom graphics, resolutions, deadzones, optimal FPS, etc. I have some the same bugs that have been in the game since season 3 that I know people on KBM and Computer do not experience. 

In no game that I have ever owned have I had to go toe to toe with people on a mouse and keyboard. KBM is superior, but the point is that the computer IN GENERAL is miles better than the Xbox or PlayStation will ever be. I have played on a computer and know for a fact it makes you play significantly better without doing anything different.  I want to compete with people on the true same playing field as me when I’m on the console. Im also certain all the computer crossplay has significantly contributed to all the complaints about Fortnite becoming too sweaty that had been flooding this sub as of recently, but that’s just speculation.

I think it’s a pretty fair complaint/request that I want to play competitively with only console people, but I seem to be the only one who feels this way.",FortNiteBR

I think we all remember the day that marshmello's skin came out, along with an emote, pickaxe, and glider. We also got a new spray, another emote, a loading screen for skin owners, and one of the coolest events ever.

&amp;#x200B;

This was a huge thing for Fortnite to do. A celebrity got his own skin, by getting Fortnite pay for the sponsorship. It was extremely successful. However, because it was a sponsor, Fortnite would need permission from Marshmello again to be able to put the skin back in the Item shop. Since this will most likely not happen, the skin will never return, making it very rare.

&amp;#x200B;

So for anyone that cares for rarity and you have the entire marshmello set, be excited that you have an exclusive skin (i have the set, so this is pretty cool)

I know spinning around fast is really fun but it is really hard to be accurate on 10 sensitivity.

Try play on a sensitivity between 6-7, Playing on 0.65 X and Y really helped my aim.

Building may seem cooler when you can turn fast but you can control your builds a lot better on a lower sensitivity.

There are so many of you out there that have so much potential, All you need to do is turn it down.

I am making this post because I have so many friends that have no idea how me and my other friend can actually hit shots, I told them to turn thier sens down and their aim is getting really good.

This is just a reccomendation though, Play highs sens if you are more comfortable with it :)",FortNiteBR

It’s been almost 11 months since its release, and people *still* think switch players are somehow inferior. Yes, we only have 30 FPS, and yes, the joy cons aren’t the best as far as accurate thumbsticks go- but we still have some potential as players. I’ve 1v1’d several amazing PC and PS4 players, one of which has been playing since Season 1- and I play equally as good as them. I’ve seen people get super surprised when a switch player hits their shots or gets high ground, and it just astounds me that this stereotype hasn’t died out yet.

Epic even treats us like mobile players, even though we play on a console as well. Yes, the system *itself* is inferior hardware wise, but a lot of us can get around that and just play with that shitty 30 FPS. I’m not trying to offend anyone, or make it seem like we’re all gods on switch, but what I am saying is; give us a chance. We’re not all dogshit, and there’s videos to prove it. I’m just genuinely curious as to why we’re still treated like bad players after almost a year of playing (more than a year for me, but I played mobile as well.). I’m not trying to start a flame war or cause any drama, I just wanna know from an outsiders perspective *why* we’re treated lower than average.",FortNiteBR

Many players aren’t getting better when they’re practicing(like me) because they’re constantly making a similar mistake while practicing that is screwing with there performance. Even if they knew, a good amount don’t know how to fix it.

My suggestion is for a mode that coaches you and helps you practice the game that would be more efficient at making you better, like a hell of a lot better. Another good idea related to this is by including an analyzer in the fortnite replays area that analyzes and tells you what you’re doing wrong and how to fix it. 

A lot of players are stagnating on progress because they’re doing something wrong/making a mistake and it’s true. Like I mention, a lot of players need in-depth help.

We need a feature like this.

Even more reasons:
-Most players are too young to have a credit card. Which is a big thing we’re basing this on.

Does Epic games take too long to address issues? Yeah, but they're working on it.

Does Epic games ignore the community? NO

Is Epic games' focus on adding new content over fixing bugs? NO

&amp;#x200B;

Programming is no joke, ask anyone who's ever made a simple mobile game, let alone the biggest PvP game in recent years. I really think we take Epic Games for granted. They spoiled us and now that they've made some terrible mistakes recently with the planes, hamster balls, etc. we have been complaining and furious with the developers. Fixing bugs is where most of the effort goes for game developers, but it's not as simple as flipping a switch like this post [by u/NomNomNomNation](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bcf2bd/what_too_many_people_seem_to_think_bugfixing_is/). Each bug that they fix, more arise so they can't just release every bug fix they find. I'm sure they're doing their best working on the bugs and glitches in the game.

Also game designers who are working on creating new skins, wraps, emotes, etc. AREN'T game developers. They don't work on fixing bugs, because that's not their job, they are supposed to come up with new cosmetic items. This gets confused a lot and I just wanted to put it out there.

In the end I think Epic Games is doing a great job trying to make everyone happy. They tried catering the more competitive players with the HP for kills, but casuals didn't like it so they reverted it. They added Arena for the competitive players and they are still working on more innovative stuff all for this community. I for one hate complaining on end about the game, so I don't. If you don't like the game, don't play it. If you see things that need fixing, give them feedback (although it may take awhile). It's our job to help them out too and complaining isn't the way to do it. We have to give them constructive criticism. We need to give them better alternatives and suggestions.",FortNiteBR

We’ve been tracking some top community concerns and we want to update you on our ongoing dev efforts. 

**POI Rendering**

Since Season 8 launch we’ve seen the feedback from players reporting points of interest rendering incorrectly when they first load in. Our team has been looking into the cause of these issues and we’ve implemented a fix in the v8.30 patch. If you are still experiencing this issue after v8.30 let us know by submitting feedback.

**VOIP**

We’ve received feedback regarding the use of certain headsets on the Switch when using voice chat. Switch is capable of supporting a variety of headsets from wired USB to wireless and while we support most manufacturer headsets we are looking into testing a variety of different headsets to increase our current supported set. 

We’re also aware of reports of voice chat not working while using a supported headset. This is an issue that the team is actively investigating.

**Motion controls**

We're working on the use of motion controls with wired controllers when the player is in handheld mode. These issues include motion control drift when changing the play style from Docked to Undocked. Additionally, we are looking into the issue of motion controls not working when first aiming down the sights of a weapon. 

Thank you for all of your feedback and we'll be chatting more often!",FortNiteBR

Epic's saying they'll be adding more Mythic items to the game, claiming it'll ""mix up the game"" or something like that. I honestly have supported almost all of what Epic does, and love this game (played since Season 2), and respect them as a company and all that, but the addition of Mythic items does not make sense IMO.

\*NOTE\* If you already know about the stats, affects, etc. of the two Mythic items that have existed in Battle Royale, do yourself a favor and skip to **What Should be Done to Prevent Mythic Items From Ruining Fortnite**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Infinity Blade**

The Infinity Blade is insane. I know Epic's going to nerf it, taking out building while a player has it in 7.10, but it still doesn't fit in a game like Fortnite. For those that don't know the exact stats, the Infinity Blade allows 130% mobility, has 2 attacks, one that swings the blade in a circle, dealing 75 damage to anyone inside its range, and another attack that allows the player wielding the blade to jump extremely far, launching players within its range into the air, as well as dealing 25 damage. Both attacks can be done in rapid succession. The Blade also grants the player wielding it a maximum 200 health and 200 shield, both of which can be regenerated if damage is taken, at a rate of 1 health or shield per second (doesn't work for a few seconds after getting hit or taking damage in other ways) and killing another player grants 50 health or shield, unless both are full. The player wielding the Blade can also tear through structures instantly, and can build their own (as of writing this post, it will allegedly be removed in 7.10).

It's not a balanced weapon, to say the least. However, the removal of building will make mobility items and long range weapons it's weakness more than before, so at least there's that. But what's the point of carrying balloons just because I don't want to die to a single player in my lobby? Any and all items should be used to a player's discretion, not forced upon  a player because of a single item. While some players want to play a legitimate game, most others (at least 30 per game, at least in the games I've played) would rather take a shot at getting the Blade early, and instantly killing anyone and everyone within their sight. This makes it impossible to play the game as I believe Epic intends it to be played. A battle royale. Not some ridiculous luck-based system where whoever wins over a single location has an extremely high chance of winning the whole game.

The only counters as far as I know are flying around the whole game in a plane, using balloons, boogie bombing the guy with the Blade, rocket launchers, and snipers (please let me know of any others I may have forgotten). The first two make you an easy target for other players, boogie bombs only disable the guy for 5 seconds or so, rocket launchers are extremely rare nowadays (and for good reason), and sniping a guy becomes extremely difficult when they're moving 30% faster than you're used to, and if you miss, the Blade-Wielder will most likely run at you or out of range. Basically all counters to the Infinity Blade have at least a small downside.

Whoever has the blade in a final circle has  basically already won, unless the other player(s) have the only counters to the weapon. This was displayed perfectly in the Winter Royale semis the other day. Psalm (that was his name, right?) got 8 kills in a minute, which is next to impossible in a regular game, and shouldn't be possible in the pro scene.

There aren't enough downsides to using the Blade yet. The only risk needed to win a game is getting the Blade, after that, it's all holding your fire/alternate fire button.

**Infinity Gauntlet**

The only Mythic item to ever have existed in the Battle Royale mode (barring the Infinity Blade) is the Infinity Gauntlet. It made the user appear as Thanos, disabled building, and disabled holding anything other than the Gauntlet. The 3 things you could do with the Gauntlet were jump extremely high and far, punch a player for extremely high amounts of damage (or basically Hulk smash the ground if you were in the air, similar to the Infinity Blade's secondary attack) and fire a laser that would deal relatively low amounts of damage on contact with a player or building (19 or so), but would repeat this damage multiple times per second for a short period of time. When the player with the Gauntlet killed another player, their 200 shield would be replenished, but not their health.

Each of the Infinity Gauntlet's abilities had a very noticeable flaw, which balanced out its power. The jump took a while to charge up and could not be cancelled, a player could not move or cancel the laser until it stopped, and the punch was really short range on the ground and required extreme precision if coming down from the air. This is what should be done to any Mythic items that ever appear on the Battle Royale Scene. They should all be extremely powerful, but each one has a very large downside.

**What Should be Done to Prevent Mythic Items From Ruining Fortnite**

Do what was done with the Infinity Gauntlet. Every ability that every Mythic item has or will have should have an extreme downside that makes the player actually consider picking up the item. It should be similar to picking up other items. The player's decision should (at least sometimes) reflect their situation. If they need to get out of a tight, close range fight, pick up the Infinity Blade (just as an example). Then, depending on the next situation they find themselves in, they should  actually have a reason to pick up regular items instead of opting for the currently all-powerful Infinity Blade, or any other Mythic item that is added. Also, they should only be available in a separate set of modes (Mythic Items available in solos, duos, squads, the current LTM, etc.)

**To Sum Up...**

Make Mythic items only worth using in some situations, but not all. Every item should have a downside. A Mythic item should be no exception.",FortNiteBR

All people do these days is cry whenever they die and beg for the weapon to be vaulted or nerfed.  ***JUST STOP!***  Vaulting is the complete opposite of progress.  It makes the game worse.  You died to a plane?  It's not OP, you're just bad.  Get better.  Find a way to counter it.  It's really not that powerful when you think about it.  You just need a scapegoat for your failures.  Planes change the game and add a whole new aspect. Updates this good are very rare.  And, the cool, seasonal sword that is a huge part of the story just killed you even though the owner can only carry it and has bad turning radius, making him a walking-target.  The reason you died?  Not because you are bad or made a mistake.  Nope, the sword definitely has to be OP and should instantly be removed from the game.  IT ISN'T AND SHOULDN'T ACCEPT YOUR DEATH AND MOVE ONE.  Vaulting is a terrible event and anyone who asks for it is against the true spirit of Fortnite.  It is a game not meant for Call of Duty or Battlefield players.  It is a game not meant for little kids.  It is a game meant for EVERYONE, and the devs have done a **perfect** job.  I have played many games in my life, and the developers of Epic (and possibly Bungie) are the only ones who care for their fans and truly make good updates for them instead of money.",FortNiteBR

A vast amount of the community, casual players, competitive, and streamers a like have agreed this is a problem, and i see their point on it.

 The solution to the problem seems to be pretty universally accepted among the community who are against the sword, put it in an LTM of its own. It isn't that people dislike the sword, a lot of people think it is fun, but when you put such a disruptive weapon into the normal mode's, it will cause backlash, and nerfing it is not the solution to this problem, moving it is.

 No one complained about the thanos gamemode, hell people even revered it as one of the best LTM's in the games history, but it was just that, an LTM. From what little gameplay i have had with the sword, it is a fun addition, i will not deny that, but it is just too chaotic for its own good when it comes to the normal modes.

I don't think the sword should be completely removed from the game, because it is a cool new item, but it really needs to be placed into its own LTM, for the sake of the game as a whole. I know you guys want to try new ideas, like adding all different kinds of mythic weapons (which if they are anything like the sword also should be specific to LTM's) and add things you guys think would be cool, but at the end of the day, as you have seen with many other updates to this game, you guys really have to tip toe around major updates like this, and you guys  just took one massive step, and it was ill footed.  I have been playing this game since season one, and i have always tried to take a stance that i can see changes, or updates from your perspective as well, not just the player perspective, and up until now, i have easily been able to defend most things you do against even the most fiercely anger player, but this time around, i just can't do it..

Personally I think they are a good addition to the game it just wasn’t executed correctly. Plane engines should spawn in chests. A legendary item that spawns about as rarely as a blue ar or something. This way once you get an engine you have to carry it to the plane then that plane can be used by anyone so you want to keep it close to you. You can also remove the engine when you want. This way less people would fly planes and people would be happy. If you have any questions or suggestions to my idea comment and I’ll try to respond. Hopefully epic sees this,FortNiteBR

Fortnite should lower the strength of aim assist on console.
Fortnite gives literal bots the ability to latch their crosshair on top of players and track them wherever they go. It’s irritating how much people rely on aim assist.
If people weren’t being babysat by aim assist it would increase the skill gap just a bit, at the same time making it less of a burden for us.
It’s not hard to aim on console if you took the time to actually try to play without aim assist and it’s also not too difficult to where you need a great amount of aim assisting strength.

Planes - Make it more of a mobility item. Make it have 50 damage to the user when it rams through wood, 75 damage for brick and 100 damage for steel and other 500+ hp objects. Every time it explodes make it do 50 damage to the user, and remove the guns off of it because they don’t fight each other anyway.

Sword - Put it in an LTM and make it has a cooldown every jump of about 10 seconds. Does not belong in regular game modes.

Heavy Shotgun - Heighten the base damage but remove the 2.5x damage multiplier. Purple: 95 Gold: 99. Make it so that it still can be better than the regular pump.

Tactical Shotgun - Give it better accuracy and buff the damage a little bit.

Zip lines: Give it an activation button and make it so that it can be used on the rope of the zip line as well.


Items that need to be vaulted:


Turret - No place in the game. Barely anybody use this and in squads it’s a total nightmare if the entire squad uses it.

Minigun - Who even uses this anymore? 

Six Shooter - The worst WEAPON in the game, not because it’s bad, because it has no purpose and is useless. It’s basically a worse SMG and AR when you ADS.

Quad Launcher: Too much of an explosive spam weapon. People use Grenade Launchers and Rocket Launchers over This anyway.

Bush - By far the most useless ITEM in the game.

Stink Bombs - Useless late game even in competitive. Terrible early game too


Items that need to be added back:


Tactical SMG - With a recent shotgun + deagle meta, this item should be put back into the game, but with some range nerfs. 

Revolver - Put in a replacement as the six shooter.


Other:


Add the storm damage thing in competitive game modes, to reduce turtling.

Up the farming rate by 20-40% (range varies)

Add 25-50 health/shield after you kill somebody to reduce the amount of RNG and to help against third partying.

Fix some other bugs (obviously)


This changes should be throughout the season, thoughts? No negative comments, please.

During the Legion expansion I was playing really hardcore with tons of characters and I had put a lot of money into the game. At some point the devs decided to stop listening to the playerbase and made changes that no one wanted.

At some point, I left and I made this post on the forums explaining the issues I had with the game:

[https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769707636?fbclid=IwAR3kbaV4I32yoN2FGgmGwzAcKkoSjXlCldUvmrZWUVRzBGILZ2JUaVOozjo#1](https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769707636?fbclid=IwAR3kbaV4I32yoN2FGgmGwzAcKkoSjXlCldUvmrZWUVRzBGILZ2JUaVOozjo#1)

&amp;#x200B;

I started playing Fortnite in March and it was incredibly REFRESHING to see that the Epic devs seemed to be totally different from the Blizzard devs. That they were constantly rolling out new content and listening to what the players had to say about it! 

But then from seasons 5-6 I felt a change. The devs seemed to still be listening but they were clearly going down a new path. Now in season 7, they're no longer listening. There were changes like glider redeploy where the community was 50/50 split on the change. I realize this leads to a hard decision and I couldn't be mad at them for going either way with it.

&amp;#x200B;

But now we're at a point where there are UNANIMOUS ideas about where the game should go.

Everyone likes the popup cup ruleset. Yet Epic has not yet decided to implement those changes into the actual game.

Instead they've decided to put in the infinity blade, despite the playerbase unanimously hating it. Then today they decide to make a post stating they're going to be keeping it, AND that we're going to be getting more items like it in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

They're no longer listening, and it's no longer the game we grew to love.

&amp;#x200B;

No other MMO could kill WoW. It crushed all it's competitors but a large percentage of it's playerbase has now left due to devs no longer listening to what the players wanted, and the current expansion has been regarded as the worst yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortnite seems to be going down this same path, and rather rapidly. ",FortNiteBR

This subreddit fucking hates change. The very instant something is added the subreddit is up in arms demanding a nerf or removal.

I can only speak for myself, but I am so immensely happy that Epic has evolved Fortnite in the way they have and I'm glad that they are sticking to their guns so far when it comes to the Infinity Blade. The idea of more Mythic items coming to Fortnite BR is a promising one in my eyes and I look forward to what's to come.

4 wins. 2 losses.

In both losses, I died to a 400 HP player that has 30% extra movement speed and a sword that destroys all of my building in one hit. They also can leap halfway across the map in 30 seconds.

I've been playing since Season Five. I love Fortnite, some hours have been put into this game. But I'm not very good. I wouldn't consider myself a gamer. Most games I'll get one or two kills if I'm lucky. But I keep trying.

But, last night I finally got my first solo victory royale. Everyone was building like crazy and usually I just hide but this time I had the Infinity Blade. 

It was so great and on top of that I got 9 kills with the infinity blade! Thank you Epic!! I love the Infinity Blade!!!!

If Epic had announced this mythical item prior to season seven launching, I'm willing to bet nowhere near as many people would have purchass the season pass.

With that being said, here's my list of things that should be changed to make Fortnite playable again.

\- Hard nerf/removal of sword. This is pretty self explanatory, but the sword user should NOT have 400 health, and should NOT have the ability to ""teleport"" all over the map within seconds. Some changes to this could be to make the user have 200 HP like a normal person should have (250 at max) The cooldown for the jump should be around 2-3 seconds to prevent people from not being able to see the sword user because he's jumping all around them. If you get this sword, you basically win the game as long as your somewhat decent at the game.

\- Planes shouldn't be in the game. It feels much less like a battle royale, and more of a ""if you get the sword and a plane, you win."" Infinite fuel, infinite ammo, and doesn't take any damage when you crash into structures with it. Changes? I think there should be a finite amount of fuel per plane, and some sort of limit on the turret. If you're really wanting to shoot someone, get on the plane and shoot it with your own bullets.

\- Grappler is still in the game. My biggest wish for S7 was to have grapplers removed. It's a super cheaty way to get high ground, and should not be in the game. If you lost a build battle, you should not be rewarded for RNG by having this item.

\- There should not be ziplines on every single hill in the game. I feel like ziplines should be much less common, as it saves sometimes hundreds of mats on the way up. It's quick, it's annoying, and it's also a cheaty way to get high ground. No mats or skill was used to take high ground. I also have witnessed multiple times that if you are building near a zipline and get a little too close, it'll throw you away and break your previous builds, which is super annoying to try to counter.

\- Minigun. Ooooh the minigun. This item is so broken and unskillful it actually hurts. Most people don't use the minigun because they know they're better than that, but for the people that do, you can't outbuild that thing. With 999 mini bullets, you can EASILY tear through someone's mats before you even have to consider their ammo count. It does damage to structures super quickly up close, and EVEN far away! A change that I would like to see is with the minigun, there should only be a 250'ish (at MOST) ammo count. You can hold more mini ammo, but some sort of thing will not let you have more than 250 bullets in your minigun. Can't reload, the only thing is to pick up the ammo. That is a difficult thing to implement, though. Maybe have a limit on mini ammo in general? I don't ever see me using more than 200-250 light ammo a game, and it'll make the minigun more balanced.

\- Shotguns: While the pump buff was FANTASTIC, it really makes the other shotguns in the game useless. Tacs are okay, but heavy shotguns were good because they did a good amount of damage from distance. If I were to use a purple pump and purple heavy shotgun, I could easily get the same amount of damage (If not more) from the pump than the heavy. What's the point in holding tacs or heavy shotguns unless you suck with aiming with pumps so you rely on how quick the tac is?

&amp;#x200B;

We released the Mythic Infinity Blade item with the v7.01 update and have since seen a healthy amount of discussion and feedback around it. In response to what we’ve seen, we’re looking to provide more context on item philosophy and some upcoming changes to the Blade.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mythic Items**

The presence of Mythic items in gameplay is to provide an interaction a step above the Legendary item functionality and something you’ll continue to see. To us, that means changing the way the game is played for those who interact with that item. The addition of items in this tier provide new and flavorful ways to interact with the map and generally shake up normal play across default modes.

We’ll have some more info with regards to our competitive philosophy when it comes to new items, updates and seasons within Fortnite early next week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Infinity Blade Changes**

The change we’re currently planning for the Infinity Blade in our v7.10 update is to remove the ability to build and harvest when wielding the Blade.

When designing the Infinity Blade the goal was to provide a weapon with inherent risk to balance out the great capability it provides - the ability to harvest/build removes a great deal of that risk. By taking away the ability to harvest/build we hope to tune the Infinity Blade to where it feels risky to have, but still satisfying to wield.

&amp;#x200B;

After this removal we’ll continue to monitor the Blade’s effectiveness and make adjustments as necessary as well as communicate those changes. Thank you so much for your discussion and feedback around the Infinity Blade!",FortNiteBR

There has come an issue that must be addressed. 
There is monstrosity among us.
I know many if you, like myself, have fallen victim to this toxic trait.

Together, we can end this disease.
This cancerous disease:
Thirsting. 

This blasphemy has every 16-and-under player running amok, seeking out one sole member of your team and locking on. Once the bounty has been placed, the player goes to Earth's end to ensure their prey is fully eliminated from the game.

Time and time again, I have watched a single player charge through a warzone, evading and absorbing bullets, just to full-kill the single person that is knocked.

This behaviour must be eradicated. 
We, as a community, cannot stand behind such a problematic issue.
I understand there are circumstances which call for it, such as wager games.

But in the end-all, thirsting is a cowardly trait attributed to the lifted truck driving, small packaged man that cuts you off and proceeds to brake check you like you did something wrong.

Please understand that if you are thirsting, you ARE the problem. And the equivalent to the aforementioned truck owner.

Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

Sincerely, 
A tired adult trying to enjoy a kids game.",FortNiteBR

Do bullet drop, it's HITSCAN, and you can easily see where your opponents are in the plane and pick them off with 3 shots at most. Guy gotta 🗡️? No problem. Keep your distance or use balloons and hit nothing but headshots Because you are direct above. With the thermal it takes only 5 shots to kill the swordbearer.

Fine I guess, what's the worst they could add in seaso- Oh hey, PLANES! These were less controversial than my other 2 examples, but still very controversial. People in this community have actively been complaining about the infinite range of planes, and how there is no penalty for having your plane explode. Just go watch the Winter Royale matches where 20 people were just flying around doing nothing the whole game. This is fortnite, not flight simulator...

Whatever though, you know what the nail in the coffin, the icing on the cake, whatever you want to call it is...

All 3 of these have been extremely controversial, and epic has not listened to community feedback. 

On top of all of this, Epic has sent out a survey on game mechanics, but only to select players. They also have stated that if you use anybody elses link, all responses from that link will be erased. I do not know why Epic wants to limit community feedback to select players, and I find it annoying they didn't send this survey out to all players!

PLEASE READ THE WHOLE POST BEFORE RESPONDING, thanks!!!

If you are like me and have played the game for many, many moons, it is starting to get a bit stale.

Additionally, I have never found it fair to drop people who average 6 kills per match in the same matches with people who average .5 kills per match.

So, how about instituting some MILD matchmaking along with tiered/graduated ranking and reward system?

Many other games do this. So many I don't really need to explain the concept (right?).

So how about this game does it? They can keep it separate from the main mode if they want. I would just like some type of tiered system that I could work towards. Something where better playing meant a better rank and better rewards. The current battle pass is simply about reps, not skill. How about something I can work towards, like higher and higher leagues/levels?

At each level, you will be matched with people in your general range of skill. No more .5 kill per game in the same game with 6 kill per game people. No more people with 100 victory royales in the same game with people with 1 or none.

This system will make it more fair, more fun and give the old-timers like me something to strive for. The battle pass just isn't doing it for me anymore, sorry.

My reasoning is simple, the sword is part of the story. It will likely play a pivotal role in the upcoming weeks of Season 7 much like our beloved Kevin did in S6. Kevin didn't have any major impact into the game, but it still gave us mobility options, and also was the cause of the Fortnitemare event. This is likely why the Fortnitemares event was kept in all games modes, since it's part of the lore/story that is being presented to us.

For this reason the sword will not be relegated to a LTM this season. Maybe Epic will come up with an LTM in the future with some sort of Infinity Sword mode, but it won't be during this season I would wager. I hope that by the next patch that moves the story forward (the sooner the better) we'll see the reason for the sword's appearance and hopeful disappearance. 

If this theory has been presented before, I apologize. I searched the sub for similar posts and haven't found any like it.",FortNiteBR

The community backlash surrounding the infinity blade is completely reasonable, as it is a ludicrous item that destroys the pacing of the game.

Most people are upset that the blade is in the normal queues, but it wouldn’t work as an LTM. People would afk if they don’t get the sword, and everybody would land polar peak. 

Why? Because people wouldn’t go into this LTM to play against a wielder, they would want to be the wielder. Making it into an LTM would make it into an unpleasant, wasted opportunity.

I propose we nerf the sword, but leave it in the game. And by nerf, I mean we really gut it. Make it some cheesy shit that you wouldn’t normally think of using, but it’s still somewhat effective. Think thermal scoped AR or pre-buff deagle. This way, it wouldn’t be a priority. And even better, it would have counterplay.

I think this change would please the causal players that enjoy being able to use a mythical fucking Excalibur rip-off and the competitive players that want none of that nonsense in their fornite.

For said nerfs, there is a lot of suggestions in the subreddit that I feel would fit this “cheesy weapon” direction quiete nicely. For example: remove the regen and the health boost. Or perhaps remove the ability to build, or reduce the damage. Make it do half damage to structures. Give the leaping ability a cool-down. Enable fall damage when leaping. Anything along those lines. 

Listen, I really like the concept of the blade, and I feel like a lot of people do as well. So I would like for it to remain in the game. But as it is right now, it makes the game unfun. 

Cheers!",FortNiteBR

I've actually only won this scenario once, and that was because the sword wielder was absolutely terrible.

My routine: log in every 3 days to do dailies (sets of 3 means less playtime yay) and weeklies when they show up.

Is anyone else's routine like this? I wouldn't be surprised, and if so its actually sad. It feels like one of those mobile games that you play a bit of every day to get some bonus reward or progress.

Also, if you are happy with the sword being in the game you either always rush peak to get the sword, or you never make it to top 2 solos, or you play LTMs exclusively (they're way more fun than normal modes right now so no shame at all)

**But at the same time, the sword finally separates the players who build with a purpose and those who don't. Building should be a tool to enhance mobility and positioning, not a get-out-of-jail free card the moment you take damage**

&amp;#x200B;

It's not that other counters don't exist, stink grenades and turrets come to mind. It's just that the sword places immediate pressure on someone to change up there strategy, and if you don't (which a lot of people don't), then you get punished. **It's like how a lot of people were complaining about the minigun being overpowered, only to realize that the best counter to the minigun is to shoot back (instead of just spam building).** Wielding the sword very often means that you have no cover (assault rifles tear you up), and that it's on you to close the gap (you have to approach the person with the shotgun)

They add something, you hate it.  
They remove something, you hate it. 

They created a whole new LTM for Food Fight, 2 days later you were asking for it to be changed for another one.

They added new vehicles, 2 days later you were calling it OP for no reason. 

They added mobilty, you hate it.

They added the Sword which is something that changes the game from the same-old we're used to, and you hate it.

I hear everyone saying ""just make it an LTM"", well, just look back at Food Fight and how it went. 

And if they DO make it an LTM, you will hate it.

The only thing I agree is that they should have left it out of the Tournament, let people get used to it first.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know how Epic feels right now. Their favorite reddit is full of people constantly searching for something new to hate on. I'm scared that we will stop getting new exciting updates just because people want Season 2 back only because it's nostalgic for them.

&amp;#x200B;

Please understand that you only love Season 1\~3 so much because it was when you started playing Fortnite, you were experiencing something new and exciting, so it will of course feel like it was better. But honestly, it wasn't.

Fortnite is fornite because it took an original idea and made it ever evolving and always changing. That is what has made this game so much fun to play. Once I think I have it all figured out there's new things to have to learn how to defend against and new ways to kill people. 

Fortnite is a phenomenal game. Love every second of playing it. I enjoy how to game offers new challenges in learning every week. And I can't stand getting on this sub to watch clips of how someone got creative to kill someone, or went on a rampage for 10 kills, or sniped someone from half way across the map, to only find a bunch of whiny little twits annoyed because ""the sword makes the game tough"".. well fucking duh!

As an almost daily player since season 1 who's spent more than I care to admit on skins and endless hours in the game, I've never felt like I've been robbed of so many games or died in the most frustrating, BS ways.

And before I go on, yes I know Epic doesn't owe me anything and this is a free game yada yada, this is just a post by a dedicated player who really wants this game to continue to succeed and flourish. And I know I'm not only speaking for myself here.

When I'm not being third partied or nose dived on by a plane, it's dying to a player with the sword. Even a number of times I've been flying a plane and my glider hasn't deployed or I've just fallen to my death when I should have been on a zipline. Not to mention if I ever do pick up the sword I'm dying to the inconsistent dash move which will sometimes bug and cause you to take fall damage which was also ever so prevalent in the Winter Royale yesterday. Oh and should I ever try to fight back against a plane, I'm getting third partied by another dude whos been creeping around the entire game.

Yes I get it 3rd partying is a thing and I don't really have a problem with that. It's more the fact that the tables tend to be tipped so far to the 3rd parties side now, along with the numerous half baked features which feel buggy and not something that can be relied on.

I didn't play yesterday because I didn't feel like it (not because of the above) but I logged on today and played about 3 hours of solos and it just wasn't enjoyable. Well over half of my deaths were due to the above. I then checked my friend groups discord (who all have a similar background to me, one of which being an aspiring pro player and avid streamer) to find that they also are feeling the same way and much to my surprise even more dedicated players than me, have decided to give the game a rest until some changes are made, if/when these actually happen. And whilst I hate to say it as I did really love this game I'm gonna be taking a break too.

I think Epic needs to take a step back, put on the brakes and really look at what is actually balanced and spend some time fixing bugs. The recent additions to the game, whilst initially were a lot of fun, are now just too much.

What I would suggest is perhaps remove the ability to destroy structures with the plane or make it so there is a larger penalty. Lowering the planes health may also help. Either that or reduce the damage from the gun to structures. We already have both the turret and quad for massive damage on structures along with the countless explosives in the game. A plane already has the ability to travel large distances on the map with little consequence, a redeploy feature and a powerful mounted gun, why should it also be so destructive to players trying to defend against it.

And secondly the sword. Whilst I'm not overly against the sword being in the main playlist it's definitely far too overpowered if it is going to be included in it. What I would suggest here is either lowering of the health of the wielder to just 100/100, or removing on the ability to build. The fact you are currently getting 400 health, regen, the ability to move around the map super quick and build and a wide AOE when you swing the sword, it's all just too much. It doesn't make sense for you to be able to dash around the map which is almost impossible to track and build. It's one or the other in my opinion. I'd have thought the fact they included a dash was because you're vulnerable and unable to build, but alas. And before someone says it, I also don't think it's balanced to have to feel like you have to change your play style so drastically and for it to be a necessity to carry around balloons with you as one of the only effective counters to this.

I'm all for adapting to game play changes and switching up my play style but in a game in which the developer has tried to give you so many options to play, you shouldn't feel pigeonholed in to playing one way just to counter one thing. One thing that you may not even come across in a game.

And finally the bugs, all the bugs I described cropped up yesterday, front and centre, in the Winter Royale so I'm sure Epic is more than aware of them. But Epic, if you're reading this and you need more clips etc, I can provide them.

I know this post is a bit lengthy and if you've read this far, I thank you and would be interested to hear your thoughts and experience the last few days. And if you're like me or my friends, make your voice known, either in response to this post or in your own.",FortNiteBR

The list go on! If you destroy a plane you waste a lot of bullets and doing it is not an easy task, why the hell can you explode a thing passengers gets no damage?

I can't recall how many times we fighting someone and suddenly a full squad comes down from a plane or passes by destroying structures in seconds.

So let's recap:

\- Guys hated C4 because it could destroy your building in seconds (planes can do the same with no self damage)  
\- People hating re-deployment before but it's ok to use an airplane and re-deploy-

\- People hate on third party but now you can literally seek all around the map for ongoing fights and third or forth party  
anything.

Planes are glitched to the point an enemy lands aside of you, and like a magic trick suddenly pops on your screen and get you eliminated because the game had not even render neither the enemy nor the plane. I have literally faced a transparent plane, couldn't walk, couldn't even move i was like wtf? and out of nothing an enemy and the plane POPS UP on my screen and BAM, eliminated.

&amp;#x200B;

As I went through this season's battlepass, I noticed (on tiers 77 and 78) this set of chains, designed to trap an animal of some sorts - let's say A DRAGON. And we all know that - probably - at some point all or some of the ice and snow on the new area will start to melt. But how will it start? What could trigger it? 

To that I say: there could be a dragon trapped inside the Ice King Castle's dungeon (at Polar Peak), still alive and well, but dorment. Somewhere along the season, this dragon is gonna wake up and begin to set itself free from the ice surrounding it, by using its own breathe. I'm guessing we will sense some trembling when this dragon starts to wake up, reverbering throughout the snow, causing snowslides or something to that effect.

By the time the ice completely melts, the Ice King Castle reveals itself and the dragon inside it will be there waiting for us.

I truly understand and appreciate that this is a business, and in business you need to retain as many customers as possible. I also understand that a vast majority of your player base is talentless bots looking to have a good time without getting mercilessly killed off drop every game. I also understand that you know that we, the relatively small faction of skilled, competitive, longtime players will not stop playing no matter how much we kick and scream. That has been true for the entire life of this game we all love so much. However, as of late, you are truly pushing the envelope of what we will tolerate, which will be discussed below. 

First off, lets go over some positives. Turrets, which now feel like the last of our concerns in the game, have to your credit, are significantly more balanced than at release. Don't get me wrong, I still think that they are primarily designed for low skill players, but at least the hit boxes are larger and they have been nerfed significantly, so hats off to you for that. 

TNT, however, is the first of my many problems with recent additions. Despite being in the game for a relatively long time, I still think it is detrimental to the game. I believe that it has absolutely ruined Tilted landings. If bad players can't find you or don't know how to properly clear a building, they simply find some TNT, which they always seem to do, and simply blow the ENTIRE building up with one stack. After which, you are now in an open lot surrounded by 20 people with high ground. Now I have many times seen this tactic deployed by excellent players and am in no way trying to insult or attack their gameplay, they are simply using the tools (overpowered or not) given to them to play their best. However, I can't help but feel like this is a way to neutralize Tilted to some degree. Despite this being the least grave of my concerns, it makes the list none the less. 

Planes are my next topic of discussion. I can somewhat understand your reasoning for putting them in the game, the fun aspect, as well as providing easy rotation for low skill players. I cannot for the life of me, however, figure out why you made the incredibly damage resistant and have given players ZERO reasons not to use them. They are slightly tolerable as a strictly rotational tool like quad crashers and ATKs. Yet you decided to give them unlimited explosive ammo, an absurdly large amount of health, and the ability to boost through any structure with absolutely no repercussions to the user. Redeploy received such significant backlash that you removed it. This was because it destroyed the fundamental principle of rotation. People were getting third partied and there was no flow to rotations whatsoever, so you got rid of it. But you couldn't leave well enough alone could you. You had to go and take redeploy, strap bullet proof armor around it, bolt a turret to it, and stick the quad crasher in the fuselage. Not to mention a vast majority of planes seem to leave each other alone after the first 2 minutes of the match, after that they just go about their business, looking for fresh build battles and 1x1s on high ground in late game. You know the 1x1s I'm talking about, built out of metal on the high ground by skilled players who (used to) use tactical advantage to win games. Then you send out patch notes and tell us that your ""fair"" nerf for the planes is 25 hp IF they get shot down? If you told me that I could rotate from Lazy to the highest ground in the circle and maybe pick up a couple free kills along the way at the cost of 25 hp I would sign up in a heartbeat.  This is absurd and I could not believe it is in the game. But that feels like nothing compared to my final bone to pick with your recent additions. 

And as you could have guessed my biggest problem is with this sword. Call me a cynic, but I honestly think that you guys figured that if we didn't boycott the game after the planes and turrets, there's nothing we wouldn't tolerate. So, in the name of bot retention, you designed a weapon so fundamentally broken that there is literally no point to Solos any more, and very little point in Duos and Squads. With this weapon, you infinitely heal to your 200% capacity, take no fall damage, and have full building capability, a capability one can take full advantage of since every farmable item in the game is now one hit. So, with these 3000 mats and borderline invincibility, you can now mosey around the map and deal your undefendable destruction. And once you reach the top 10 which you will, you can sit back and enjoy seeing everyone else remember that that thing is in the game and accept their fate. 

I have never in my life seen an online game that so frequently changes the core mechanics and strategy of the game. However, what profounds me above all else is that you decided to take these mechanics that are borderline too radical for an LTM and add them HOURS before the biggest and most publicized tournament you have ever held. You took the best players in the world, including the most popular gamer on the planet, and gave them a completely different game than they qualified in, and a completely different game than they practiced for. You gave the people who would hate these changes the most, who also have the largest platforms possible, EVERY reason to publicly berate you. These players have finally reached the breaking point of biting the hand that feeds them. You have players in the biggest tournament in your history abusing these additions to their own distaste just to prove a point for all to see. I believe you have to know that the planes and sword have to come out of the game, a conclusion I came to by noticing how little you included the sword and planes in your broadcast of the WR grand finale. Now I'm not saying that you will, as I have a hard time believing that these flagship changes that you have hyped up so much and seemed so proud of are fundamentally broken and ruining the game. You have the best players in the world being shot or knocked to their deaths by planes flown by people with 0.33 career K/Ds while being watched by hundreds of thousands of cumulative views. I would suggest putting planes, turrets, and the sword in an LTM for the bots to have a blast on, however I don't think you'll do that because you're afraid of how few people would play that and cause you confront these terrible changes relative to the standard modes. 

If this is what it takes for you to keep these unskilled players that outnumber us so badly playing, then hats off I guess its mission accomplished. Keep in mind I am not bashing the skilled players who use these features. You are simply using what is provided to you to your advantage. But Epic, please know that this is not the game that we, the loyal players who have been playing long enough to remember how it used to be, fell in love with. We asked for snow, holiday skins, and performance enhancement, but we got airplanes and magic swords that no one wanted as well. 

And no, I am not some 7.5 KD 2000+ win player whose upset his stats are dipping. I am a career 1.5 KD 250 win player who would rather never win another game by being outplayed by people truly better than me and using fundamental SKILLS to their advantage (which would force me to improve) than win with a magic sword in an airplane. 

If you have made it to this sentence I assume that you are as frustrated by this as I am and I would love to hear your thoughts and comments. ",FortNiteBR

In the story this blade has the power to kill immortal beings. The main character’s goal is to put an end to these immortals who ruin the lives of others (wow unknowingly being a “deathless” himself due to having his memories wiped).

It’s creator betrays the main character and goes on to create other clones of it called the “infinity weapons” which hold its same power, but on a lesser scale. At the end of the game, our main character resets the memories of the blades creator and “kills him.” In reality giving him a second chance

Epics inclusion of the blade could be an Easter egg for another infinity blade game, but not under the same title. Only 3 people saw where the blade had gone. Only 2 had their memories of the event. Of that 2 only 1 was male. This means Infinity Blades protagonist (who reverted back to his wicked ways) must be the Ice King, as he is the only one who knows the location of the blade, and takes it to the castle.

Both the other 2 people at the end killed theirselves in the storm though, the sword guy accidentally jumped into it and the other person accidentally trapped theirselves in it.

I'm not very good at the game but I almost missed last season's victory umbrella, so I was going the hiding strategy until I got a win so I wouldnt miss this seasons victory umbrella. I got the solo win first and got the duos win later.",FortNiteBR

I'm running an overclocked 8700k and a 1080ti. Brand new 2 month old system, every driver updated. Every other game runs 2-300 fps no issue.

Fortnite? On lowest graphics I am lucky to receive 90 fps. I've been stuck with ~100 ping and connection time outs in pubs for two months now on west servers. 


I can't deal with the planes, the swords, and all the other plethora of bad ideas.


I've spent over $1500 on this game over the course of the year, I've finally detached myself from this. The amount of money I spent on cool items in the item shop is what kept me attached to this game, hoping and praying it would become better, hoping and praying that it would actually work, that I would physically be able to play because i did not want to 'waste' my cash - but it's gotten worse, and it's been over 2 months without any of it getting fixed - it just gets worse every patch.


There is actually no hope in sight, I can't actually see this game improving. The tournament the past 2 days is actual proof that this developer just doesn't give a crap anymore - at all. 

I feel sorry for the people in the winter royale. Imagine grinding your ass off for this, only to be met with one giant shitshow. 


Anyways, those of you sticking around hoping for the best - wish you luck. I really hope at one point they fix it. For those of you who aren't, happy uninstalling. It's liberating.",FortNiteBR

Minis are almost always prioritised since you'll usually lose shield in a fight but not always health. The only time bandages are useful are if you're deep in the storm. 





How bandages stack to other heals: 

Bandages give you 15 HP in 4 seconds. 

That's 3.75 HP/Sec

Medkits give you 10 HP/Sec

Minis give you 12.5 HP/Sec

Big pots give 10 HP/Sec

And Chugs give 13.3 HP/Sec

Bandages will only be useful if they increase the HP/Sec (increase HP or decrease time) or if the Max HP is increased from 75 to 100

1. Planes: Epic was already pushing it by adding planes to this season and I don't understand why they made them so op? I'm sure most of you remember on this subreddit where everyone was like ""VAULT TURRETS!"" so instead of vaulting turrets, they just stuck them on a flying vehicle that can 1 shot people and buildings. There are no counters to these planes except pulling a streamer btw grappler onto the seat and 1 pumping them, I don't think these should be vaulted I just think there should be some sort of counter, because clearly building doesn't work.
2. Infinity Sword: Infinity sword is annoying for many reasons

1 Because it's overpowered af and you can again 1 shot buildings and kill players in 3 hits

2 It's hard as hell to get because there are swarms of people at polar peak who want to get it (understandable because its op)

3  Once you actually get the sword you are basically a target for many kids on planes following you the entire game until they get their epic gamer sword

3. Spammy type weapons:

Fortnite keeps adding spam weapons for some reason and its pretty annoying. E.g I'm in a closed 1 by 1 and this player throws 4 sticks of dynamite at me and then spams his p90/minigun while im constantly trying to build and by the time the exposions are over im on like 10 health and he just comes down and 1 pumps me.

But then again there's this weird dynamic because if you have the sword and you're in a 1v1 with someone that has balloons then you're screwed again. So there's no way to know what to do.

A) You hope that when you have the sword the last person won't have balloons.

B) You have balloons and if there are more than 3 people left you're most likely going to get shot out of the air.

C) Save an inventory slot and get deleted by the sword.


Recently I've been taking it upon myself to balance the game. As you may know, the sword is pretty unbalanced and to combat this I have been grabbing balloons early game then making a beeline over to the sword holder and countering the shit out of them. Then guarding the sword with my life until the storm engulfs it. Then wow tah-dah game is back to normal and I don't have to stress late game that I'm going to be annihilated in 2-3 hits.

I don't even need to talk about the Infinity Blade, as this subreddit has talked about it enough in the last 24 hours.  Instead, I want to talk about planes now.

Speak of skill gap reducing, planes are ruining the game for me.  This community was up in arms about redeploy, but has said nothing of planes.  

Allow me to pose a question: What is worse than an enemy being able to pull out their glider at will and come down to you after you've just finished fighting someone?  Instead of answering that question for you, let me ask you this; would it be worse if said enemy could glide endlessly, change direction at will (up/down included), tear down your builds by gliding/boosting into them, do direct damage by gliding into you, AND be able to shoot their gun?  I think the answer is yes.  

The community complained endlessly because of redeploy, but how are planes not 200 times worse?  The game is fun without them, but as soon as there are seemingly a million of them flying above you, the game loses all ""fun"" value and just becomes frustrating.  Couple that with this clown of a weapon in the Infinity Blade and this game is less fun over the last couple of days for me than it has ever been.  Dropping, looting, finding good weapons, and collecting mats isn't even a priority anymore.  I can honestly say that I'm playing less and less every day, and can see myself eventually getting to the point where I don't play at all in this clown fiesta.

Just take the Winter Skirmish as a prime example of how ridiculous planes and the Infinity Blade are to the game.  It was cool to have them around and play with them for a little bit, but it's already old.  Please, Epic, move them to LTM and let us have Battle Royale back.",FortNiteBR

What's good for the competitive scene isn't necessarily good for casuals.,"Competitive players make up a large sum of people who participate online. This leads to a vocal and loud minority that does not necessarily reflect the casuals.
Some points-
1.Competitive fortnite is an advertisement. Sure epic pays out millions but those are advertising costs. Stop deluding yourself with the idea that Epic gives a shit about competitive.
2. Pandering to casuals is not bad at all. They ARE literally 99% of the player base. Sure it might seem like many people agree with your views here this is because the casuals don't care enough to write in Reddit. Those writing on Reddit are hardcore players. 
3. These constant updates are necessary for epics model to work. It constantly keeps the game fresh and encourages micro transactions.
4. REMEMBER ITS JUST A GAME. I too raged and got angered by video games when I was younger. This may be because I've become older and I have more problems to deal with than a video game but try to remember that it's a game. It's not the end of the world if you get 2nd.
5. Some examples of things that are good for competitive but bad for casuals-
Planes- Gives casuals who aren't good at engagements something to do in the game. You can only get killed by some master builder so many times before you give up on the game.
Porta forts- This is self explanatory, porta forts gives boobs something to do.
6. As much as it sucks for the people who put in hours into the game, we kind of have to be aware that a large skill gap will only lead to a lower player base and growth. Noob items are a necessary evil and still beats things such as the matchmaking in cod.

The first is allowing players to turn off aim assist for snipers and hunting rifles.  While auto rotation on the hunting rifle can help you at short distances, bullet drop really negates this benefit in most situations.  For scoped rifles, trying to snipe a jumping target is extremely annoying because their movement drags your reticle up and down and all over the screen even if you aren't moving the reticle at all.  I think I speak for everyone when I say I'd like to be able to shoot where I think a player will land his jump without being so encumbered by aim assist.  

The second change I would make is less necessary but would be nice none the less.  Aim assist on players riding the quad crasher or planes.  The aim assist auto rotation on vehiclea pulls your reticle down onto the vehicle and away from the actual player on top.  No one is purposefully trying to destroy the quad a player is riding, we are trying to get the player.  I find it extremely difficult to do any damage at all to a player riding a quad at a distance because the quad seems to take all of the damage almost as though the quad provides protection up and round the player.  It's ridiculous.  Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

This game use to be some of the most fun ive had in my entire life, the skill gap being so high makes you want to continue to improve and improve and learn something on every death. 

Since season 7 ive been getting owned by planes, and constantly getting killed by this sword. Planes ram into me waste my mats, lower my hp, and constantly get me killed due to fall damage. 

It makes me depressed because theres no way to counter play the ways ive been dieing, and thats exactly what Epic wants I guess, a way where even good players can't counter the stuff happening to you. 

Ive fought the sword around 10 times and died 8 times only because I ran out of materials fighting it, the 2 times I killed the guy was because I had 2k mats each time and outplayed it. If epic is going to add stuff like the sword atleast buff the mats so it can be countered easier. 

It actually depresses me to be honest, I always use to say im going to quit this game every other update but never do, this is probably the time where I actually do. 

Is anyone feeling what im feeling?

Why?

Mainstream viewers don't want to watch people who can build 42 walls in 5.5 seconds.  That's a bad viewing experience.  They want to be able to armchair QB.  They want to watch a match of Fortnite and say ""I can't believe Ghost Aiden went for X and positioned here."". They don't want to say ""I can't believe how fast Ghost Aiden built.""

Viewers need to be able to think, in the moment what they would do in a given scenario.  That's the strength of this game from a viewership perspective.

The good news is I think Epic is already starting to head in this direction.  The bad news is it's not going to happen quickly.

I just think (my opinion) that this game was at its best before all extraterrestrial and magical assets were added, such as the Cube, hop rocks, rifts (useful and good but still), shadow stones, and magical sword. 

I liked the game without all of this magic and fantasy stuff. 

Who would’ve thought that you would be able to consume things that make you invisible for 45 seconds, be able to be killed by a giant purple cube, have a crystal that can make you jump high, enter a portal that puts you in the sky, and have a magical sword that takes away fall damage and gives you 400hp? If you told someone about all of this 4 seasons ago they would’ve thought you were crazy!

But yeah in conclusion I don’t like the fantasy and magical turn this game is taking when it used to be a cool survival type game where everything was determined by how you played instead of if your opponent was invisible or could jump really high or had a magical sword.

We should ALL be using HIGH DPI and LOW SENSITIVITY!

I was doing some tests and I found out some interesting things about the sensitivity in Fortnite.

For the sake of simplicity, we will be working with these 2 loadouts.
 1. 800 DPI and 0.20 sensitivity
 2. 10000 DPI and 0.01 sensitivity

Now let's pretend that both of these settings result in the same ""Rotation speed."" Meaning, it takes the same amount of mouse movement to rotate say 45 degrees even though both settings are different.

Now, here's why you should use the High DPI setting instead of the Low DPI setting...

Let's pretend that we're on 800 DPI 0.20 sensitivity... When you move the mouse JUST ENOUGH to rotate the camera it's smallest amount, you will rotate the camera 2 degrees. (again these numbers are not accurate, they're just for simplicity.)

If you were to then switch to 10000 DPI and 0.01 sensitivity, you will notice that each tick of camera movement is no longer 2 degrees, but instead more like 0.5 degrees... But it still takes the mouse the same amount of movement to get to that 2 degrees.

So I'll lay it out so you can see better what I mean... (These numbers again, are just so you understand what's happening, they are not perfectly accurate.)

800 DPI, 0.20 sensitivity: Moving the mouse 1/10 of a Centimeter will result in 1 camera tick, moving it 2 degrees.

10000 DPI, 0.01 sensitivity: Moving the mouse 1/10 of a Centimeter will result in 4 camera ticks, moving it 0.5 degrees each tick.

So as you can see, you can actually get a lot FINER accuracy and aim by using a high DPI and low sensitivity. You are rotating your camera on way more of a sub-pixel level than if you were to use low DPI and high sensitivity.

Using low DPI and high sensitivity you are actually SKIPPING sub-pixels...

This could lead to issues with aiming such as... You're aiming at someone 250m away. Your crosshair is right on their head and you shoot, but the bullet flies to the left of the enemies head by the smallest amount...

Then you move the crosshair ONE TICK to the right, and now the bullet is flying past their head to the RIGHT by the smallest amount... You've pretty much skipped over that persons head in 3D space.

With high DPI and low sensitivity, moving the mouse to the right ONE TICK would have resulted in your shot most likely hitting the head and not skipping over it.

These degrees I'm talking about are small...

But you can test it for yourself. Go into the game. Aim at a wall or something straight up and down. Line your crosshair up to be on the SIDE of the wall. So the right-most pixel of the wall is touching the left-most pixel of the crosshair... Move the crosshair 1 tick towards the wall...

In my case, I saw the crosshair(which, without it's outline, is 2 pixels in height/width) move 2 pixels to the left. Now my crosshair was fully overtop of the wall. The right-most pixel of both the wall and my crosshair were perfectly lined up.

When I changed to 10000 DPI and 0.01 sensitivity and did the same thing... Lined it up... Moved it ONE TICK to the left. Only about 25% of the crosshairs 2 pixels were covering the wall. The rest was still sticking out the side. because I'd moved less degrees than I did with low DPI!

I hope this makes sense to some people! This has tremendously helped my aim and accuracy out. For a while I felt like something was just... Off... I don't know... But when I tested all of this out and made the change, I had such greater range in terms of my accuracy, I was hitting shots WAY more often.

Hopefully this helps!

If this doesn't get much traction I will just make a video about it, visually showing you guys exactly what I mean!",FortNiteBR

\-Planes

\-The sword

Just a few examples. Without fail, every time some new and cool new feature is added, there are people whining about how it is ""ruining"" the game, even though the novelty of these additions is what keeps the game interesting. Some people complain about balance, but guess what? This is a game that is inherently imbalanced, and will never be balanced. The fun of new additions by far outweighs balance effects.

So good job epic with all these cool features, but I hope you do not allow a vocal minority (and yes, if you are complaining about these things you are part of a vocal minority), to slow your innovation or make you hesitant to add new things!

I want to give epic the benefit of the doubt like I always do. But this is different. Most new ""op"" weapons and whatnot have a variety of weaknesses that ultimately balance it out usually through skillful building or other techniques. The only effective way I can think of to counter the sword is using balloons or a grappler which really sucks. If you plan on getting a victory, then you know you'll eventually have to fight sword dude and I don't want to be forced to carry balloons or a grappler every damn game. (I don't want to be forced to fight sword dude but it is what it is.) I know you can build skillfully to counter the sword but honestly it's banking on the sword guy not being very good. There's gotta be another way. Has anyone else figured out a good strategy to beat the sword guy that doesn't depend on balloons, grapplers, noob sword players, or just plain luck?

I love fortnite, it's been my main game since I started in season 4. I always love finding new ways to counter new weapons, etc. but I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS FREAKING SWORD.

Players engaged in the cinematic would be invincible to other players while it is occurring. The cinematic could be a button mash type fighting sequence, where whoever presses the button(s) faster gets a high damage attack.

1) Loot is imbalanced: it’s great that they keep adding new items in the game but all that does is just mess with the spawns. Countless times where I’m low hp and struggling to find bandages. Yes, bandages a grey item as in it’s supposed to be really common. Instead I get balloons and dynamite. Purple and green respectively.

2) The map changes keep the game fresh but mess with the rotations: it’s bittersweet. I personally love map updates, I’m always excited to see what they add. Unfortunately it messes with rotations. It just does, the game is so unpredictable because it’s constantly changing. To me, their best map was season 3 by far. Perfect rotations and balance. Decreased the risk of third and even fourth parties because, well it operated like a normal br map.

3) Planes are so cool! Yet so annoying, sad: yep they’re pretty freaking cool but uh I’d really appreciate not getting rammed by a plane while I’m having a really intense build fight with someone, thx. 

I just feel the core to this game has just been lost, the core being using effective building and gun strategies to outplay your opponents, emphasis on the building part because that’s what separates this game from other games. Simple as that y’all. That’s what made this game so much fun in the first place.

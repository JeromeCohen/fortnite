My daughter and I play Fortnite and given her age, it's one of the only things we bond over nowadays. I love the game but admittedly, I suck. Her and I have been playing the John Wick event, which I think is so much fun but unfortunately we haven't gotten a win yet. I'm not really into the cosmetics, so I don't mind but she really wanted the umbrella!

But with the end of the event coming up, I don't think I can get a win for her before then. So if any of you skilled athletes would like to help me crank 90s to get an epic Victory Royale for her, I'd be so grateful! Send me a DM and I'll add you.

I had a few month break and now i started fortnite again on my switch. I played for the last day but man the 1v1 close range battles get out of the sudden sooo hard. I never struggled with them. In fact this was where i was good at but now i get killed almost every time and i do not have the feeling that i doing worse honestly but the other guys have suddenly such an insane aim. Every shot hits. Is it possible that the aim assist on mobile is a little stronger than the one on console? Does somebody has a similar experience? I mean there is a good chance that out of the sudden i lost all my ""skill"" i gathered in my 300+ hour playtime but it would be really weird i think.

It is merely two seasons old, it added a whole quarter of the map that we never had, and although destroying two POIs, it brought in three all new and arguably far better locations than the ones we lost!

Before the Season 7 there were posts as old as time asking for Epic to add something, *anything* to that quadrant of the map to make it more interesting, and now that its finally here, there are so many people saying ""I can't wait for it to melt"" or ""*When* the ice melts"" or anything of that nature. Why? We gained so much from it and merely lost Greasy and Flush (*which was the single worst POI in the game at the time of Season 6*).

&amp;#x200B;

Let's compare the ice biome to, say, the Tropical and Desert climates located at the Northeast and Southeast corners of the map respectively; the Iceberg destroyed Flush and froze over Greasy but added Polar Peak, Frosty Flights, and Happy Hamlet, as well as a great pool of loot in unnamed locations and randomly scattered about the frozen tundra. Both Flush and Greasy were Day 1 POIs that saw six full seasons go by with zero changes.

Compare all that to the Desert for example, which destroyed Moisty Mire, the unnamed Prison POI, and the whole swamp. Yes, it added the convenience of mobility where the Mire would slow you down and cause frustration, the Desert only added Paradise Palms and three unnamed locations of interest, all of which are large but aside from Paradise and ""Westworld"" as it has been dubbed, lack any substantial loot. The Desert has also seen 4 seasons now with no major changes at *all* meanwhile no one seems to bat an eye at it, meanwhile, the Icy Tundra arrived a mere 2 seasons ago and people are dying for it to melt!  
Finally, the Tropical climate; which has been around for now two seasons, but let's look at what we lost and what we gained. Both Wailing Woods *AND* Lazy Links were destroyed in the Volcano's rising, as well as other notable unnamed locations such as the brick-turned treehouse in the Northeast, and the storage container yard Southwest of Wailing. By the end of Season 7, Wailing Woods had seen some *serious* changes and became one of the best drops on the island, even rivaling Tilted and Pleasant in terms of Loot but *far* surpassing them in mobility and the ability to loot fast and rotate even faster thanks to the rift technology. Yet, what we gained from this was Sunny Steps and Lazy Lagoon, as well as the unnamed Volcano; all of these locations themselves have very good loot and thanks to the Volcano and volcanic vents, retains the ability to rotate quickly. Of all three biomes, I think that the Tropical biome was the second best addition as it kept the mobility and loot of Wailing as well as improving upon these aspects, but unlike the Tundra, it didn't add more landmass, instead, it overrode what we had.

&amp;#x200B;

# TL;DR Why hate the Icy Tundra and not any of the other biomes when it arguably added far more than the Desert or the Tropical biome ever did? Why does ""everyone"" seem to want it to melt ASAP?",FortNiteBR

90,microKEEL,1558224483,bqantp,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bqantp/this_game_is_great_but/,1,"This game is GREAT, but...","1. Why...after so many season...when you enter the game you see the same loading screen multiple times and not just one long time? It's so jumpy and confusing... If you don't get what I am saying, just start the game and watch the screen. You see an image, then you see another image, then you see again image #1 and then... it's just annyoing for such a great game. I like perfection and this detail should not be that hard to ""fix""(polish).
2. The fact that they added so much mobility is just annoying. It was great at the beginning, but now everyone is flying around and it's just not that cool anymore... I just hope that something will happen in the next event and those slipstreams will be destroyed.
3. The fact that PING is such an important thing when it comes to replacing wall is again very annoying. Having a better PING (enemy has 10 and you have 30), gives the enemy a big advantage which should not work like that. Got no ideea how replacing walls can be reworked in order to not favor the ultra low ping players.
4. They took away the 1 shot gun (Pump) but they brought the spray gun (Drum). Getting sprayed down with 2 Drum Guns while you are trying to use your skills and build+get height only to die because 1 Drum Gun has 50 bullets in a magazine is just sad...
5. Shadow Bombs are indeed nice and great. But that is only if you use them. They should not work like that and I am talking about infinite invisibility + jumps when climbing a mountain or building. A nerf could do the trick...or a vault. Don't get me wrong, I love to have fun with them, but I do not find it that FUN when the enemy has them...
6. The game has so many skins that it's demoralizing that you have to wait soooo much for that one skin to get back in the shop rotation. 24 hours/rotation is a lot considering that the game has so many skins nowadays. Eighter make the rotation bigger or make it 12 hours/rotation. The first suggestion could work better since there are a lot of people that got used to this schedule.
7. The fact that the smallest amount of V-bucks that you can buy is 1000 for 10 Euro is not that great for people that need 100 or 200 more V-bucks in order to buy a certain skin. I guess there is some marketing strategy there ofc, but adding 500 V-bucks for 5 Euro would be better in my opinion. I just said this because I personally feel upset when 100-200 V-bucks are between me and a very nice skin that I can't get. Instead of me not spending money at all because I find that spending 10 Euro only for those 100-200 V-bucks is just too much, this method of 500 V-bucks for 5 Euro can make this difference between me not spending money at all or spending 5 Euro. I know that if I really want that skin I should spend those 10 Euro, but even if I do it, I would be upset with the game and not that happy with my purchase...
8. I find that Combat Shotgun is a bit too good. I love it and I kinda mastered it, but I find it too easy to use compared to our old pal, Pumpy. I don't mind killing tons of people with the Combat Shotgun, but I think that they mind it which makes me not feel that good about myself using this weapon that it's overpowered in the right hands. My hands are not PRO hands, which makes me again wonder what if a PRO masters this shotty?...
9. When opening an ammo box or chest, the bullets/items should not jump all around the box. They should jump eighter in front of you (between the chest/box and you) or if we are talking about the ammo box, they should just get inside you like being magnetised or something.

For the moment, all that I felt that I should bring up I wrote it here. If something more comes back to my mind or someone else posts something important in the comments, I will update the post with those suggestions in the EDIT part.

Event comes out, based on one of my favourite series of all time, so I get hyped, but then, the event is squads based.
Unlike endgame, which was a big team mode, the JW event is 4 player squads, and there's a very nice juicy reward for getting a win. However, As much as I want it, i'm unlikely to get it. It's hard to get a win in solo squads, squadsfill is a bad idea, and i only have three-four days left.
It is theoretically possible, but not only am I at a huge disadvantage when soloing, it's just really unfun to be attacked from all angles at once by a whole squad, and being able to do fuck all.

Also, with John Wick being a lone wolf, it'd make far more sense for the event to be solos.

At the end of the Tales Of Beyond event storyline in STW Lok the robot sees the cube and describes it as a monster. And then the rest of the STW cast of characters sees it by looking through his recordings. 

Ray the robot points out that the cube means change and that there's a big change coming for STW. But just like with the Storm King event that could have implications for BR. 

So yeah. At least in the STW universe Kevin the cube hasn't been destroyed. And if there are ever going to be cube fiends in Battle Royale it's likely the cube must return in some way because you can't have cube fiends without the cube.

Now, Why do I want the ATK and shopping cart back? Well...

1) There are no squad vehicles in fortnite, a squad vehicle for 4 people could have a big effect on squads

2) They're balanced. Quick, but not too quick, only good for driving, no major sheild (unlike the baller)

3) The shopping cart could be buffed to fit down but not out players in, making it a strategic duos vehicle

4) The ATK and the shopping cart stand out when it comes to drive by's, especially the ATK. It absolutely shreds when the team mate who is good at driving keeps the squad safe, when other team members could spray others down with rifles. This is especially good when in the safety of the front passenger seat.

5) The ATK looks amazing with the wraps we have received over the seasons.

6) The current vehicles are too good. The Quad Crasher destroys buildings really effiecently, and the baller gives you 150 more health to fight off others, not counting its grappler. The cannon is pretty balanced, though.

7) There are perfect places to spawn them. Shopping carts in Mega Mall, Junk Junction, Happy Hamlet, and Fatal Fields (Like, as a farmers market.) And ATKs in Parking lots around Tilted and Dusty Diner, and at Snobby Shores and Paradise. The Golf Karts could be placed in any place that's a city, or a neighborhood, basically

8) The ATK was noisy, so people had to be strategic about rotating with it.

Thank you all, I hope you agree with me",FortNiteBR

Quick question and this is not in anyway meant to be a who is better kind of conversation.

Recently got a new desktop after getting into the Champions League with a mate on PS4 duos. Average player nothing too fancy. 

However since starting on PC i have noticed a real variation in the lobbies. Ranging from some really skilled builders to total bots.

Is it fair to say that PC has a higher skill gap but more bots due to a higher player count or am I just talking rubbish.

Just seems to be much more variation in the skill level of players im up against compared to the PS4.

Or is it simply due to me making a new account!

Enjoying the FPS though, building definitely feels much more fluid.",FortNiteBR

Friday I was playing a few games of the John Wick LTM, desperately trying to get the black umbrella, but didn’t even come close. I thought about some different strategies, and I figured it out, winning on my first try yesterday. 

I think anyone is capable of winning this umbrella, provided you have 3 teammates who coordinate with the plan. 

Step 1: Land Safe

You want to land away from everyone, preferably a place with good loot and NO ONE ELSE. This is key, as you don’t lose any lives early game, and get to farm up a bunch of mats/get solid weapons/shield. 


Step 2: Charge the #1 Team

After you’ve looted up, killing the #1 team should be pretty easy, and you’ll get all their coins, putting yourself in #1


Step 3: Attack the Next Highest Teams

Don’t stick around in the same spot, as everyone is going to come after you. Instead, attack the #2 team, and by then if you are successful, it should translate to a win. If not, just attack the next highest team. 


Bonus: Boom Bow’s make for a bunch of easy kills, just get to high ground and fire away. 

Also Bonus: I made a video demonstrating these tips. Enjoy!

In terms of balance and mechanics it is perfect. I've had so much fun with this mode and feel it would be a great model for future competitive as well as casual. The 3 respawns are awesome and give you a chance to full send and play aggro and not hate the game when you die but also not completely rage when somebody kills you. The golden tokens system is great because it allows players to tailor their play style to their situation. It could allow a new player to get one or 2 kills and win the game while not being unfair to those who play a lot. It's a lot of fun and really balanced. You guys have successfully found a mode that can be a casual game like team rumble, but also that could work for a competitive mode as well. This is a big thing Epic. 
Please. Keep doing stuff like this. The introduction of respawns makes it so we don't need siphon settings and wouldn't reward overly aggressive play styles with shield. The fact that you have 2 balanced, effective weapons on spawn is actually game changing. Makes me land smarter knowing that everybody has a gun but also takes out the rage factor of not finding a gun you need. It would be even better with mats. If you didn't need to farm to get resources, and it slowly increased from 100/50/50 that would be perfect. 
This mode could be renamed Assassin and be a long term LTM at least.",FortNiteBR

I find it very fascinating to see how a new in-game rule set can fundamentally change the overall game mechanics of how to get the VR.  

For some reason, it seems to me that the vast majority of players in Wick's Bounty mode play very aggressively.   I know many people enjoy this play style (and that's fine), hence so much vitriol around the removal of siphon.  This aggressiveness can be a winning strategy for top notch ('sweaty') players/squads who can reasonably rack up dozens of eliminations without getting eliminated themselves.  For bots like me, however, this is a failing strategy.  Any coins gained are quickly lost and respawns are quickly burnt up.  So here's my proposal for a winning strategy for Wick's Bounty:

1.  **You only need as few as 2 eliminations to win.**  Once the 'top 3' squads surpass the half-way mark (250 coins), if you assume best-case that one player carries all the coins, all your squad needs to do is eliminate two of those 'top 3' and you've reached 500 coins--to make it easy, they are marked on the map!  Worst case, the coins are spread across the entire squad and your squad must wipe the full squad.  Still, this is much more manageable than attempting a 20+ kill streak.
2. **Be patient.**  Let the aggressive players do the hard work of aggregating coins by 4's as they eliminate the low hanging fruit players one by one.  The fewer players on the map and more consolidated the coins, the better.  Save all your respawns for ambushing those 'top 3'. 
3. **Drop in a quiet POI and loot strategically**.  Load out should focus on ambushing those 'top 3' squads.  Again, be patient with looting.  Lots of mats.  Max shield.  weapons to ambush high-coin squads/players-- RPGs, boom bows, etc.  Also, mobility is key to be able to move quickly from one 'top 3' to the next without losing the first half of the coins, so grab rift-to-go's as well.  Start moving into position to ambush once the 'top 3' are about half way (250 coins).
4. **If one squad mate gets 200+ coins, sequester them.**  Have them rift-to-go to the edge of the storm in a quiet location and built a metal fortress, hide in a tree, etc. so as not to risk the first half of your bounty during the 2nd squad ambush.  Remaining squad members go after the second 'top 3' group. 

I know all this is easier said than done, and also I know some may not like or agree this more subdued, strategic play.  I am very interested in fielding a squad of bots like me to commit to this type of strategy to get the win-- I'm on Switch (no mic) and NA East most evenings and Saturday mornings, leave a comment if interested.  If no one cares to try, I'll just carry on auto-filling and grinding and hoping for the best.   

Thanks for listening!",FortNiteBR

In a lot of games - specifically squads - seeing a player with 200 health/shield coming out of a fight is extremely rare.

The heavy sniper and damage traps deal 150 damage each, with the heavy doing that much damage to the *body*. In a very long-range, picking off targets situation, the heavy outclasses the other snipers by a wide margin even with its hour-long reload time.

Damage traps are easy to place and arm themselves almost instantly, making it extremely difficult for a cornered player to avoid the massive amount of damage it deals. With the current state of shield, it’s just as difficult to survive that damage. 

Although the heavy sniper at least takes a marginal amount of skill to hit with, its damage is so much higher than any other.

I love me a heavy sniper and I love getting trap kills. But it’s become much easier to get both with recent updates. Is it time for a change? What would it be?",FortNiteBR

Who ever is in charge of the exclusive bundles, stop making Xbox have console exclusive skins.
Simply being a PlayStation plus owner, each season we are practically gifted a free skin bundle. 

While Xbox has only had now 2 bundles. Each requiring you to purchase a console, PlayStation has had 7 celebration packs, as well as the royal bomber for a controller bundle (originally a console bundle in other countries besides the us)

As a PlayStation player, I feel that this business tactic mistreats the Xbox consumers. Wanting a skin for hundreds of dollars at this point is ridiculous. Give Xbox players celebration packs just like us PlayStation users",FortNiteBR

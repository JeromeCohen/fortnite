They aren’t balanced at all. Either nerf the damage of traps or give them a longer cool-down when placed so they aren’t spammed when in CQC engagements. Accuracy and precision should be what wins you close quarter fights not putting down spike traps on every wall. They need a big nerf.

We made it to the final 2 and got steamrolled by a player with 28 kills.  The fight wasn't even fun for us because we had no chance.  

If one player gets 28 kills in one match that leaves 99 other people fighting over the remaining 72 kills.

And who knows how many other 6+ kill players were in that match.

That's the definition of unhealthy.

Reasons you may ask for why it should be nerfed?



*It's NOT fun to be one-shot

*Requires VERY little skill

*If they can't aim, don't reward them



I am seriously considering to quit this game because of this BS. Alright let me tell you a story. It's a 1v1, I have 10 kills. 999 wood and really good weapons. I see a no-skin, who doesn't know what he is doing. I ran up to him to try to get some funny reactions for my YouTube channel. I instantly out-build the bot. He barely even placed a ramp, I said a very clever, satireish joke about him being an android. Alright, so I am above him trying to scare him. He throws out another NO SKILL item, the boom box. I of course fall towards the ground, the bot instantly one shots me, like WTF. It's already a problem that people destroys my building. I die, and the bot got his first win. I looked up his stats, he has like 0,40 or some garbage like that. I of course add him afterwards, tells him how god-awful he is, I asks if he wants to 1v1 and he responds with ""salty"". I reported him and told him to go the hell.

I do realize it was recently buffed, and it's the one single BIGGEST mistake Epic has ever made. If they CAN'T aim, don't reward their bot ways. I would say I am pretty decent. I usually have over 10 people watching me play (I just haven't kicked off yet). I try to advertise when I can, check out my trolling montages.",FortNiteBR

41,Thalana,1551557711,awlt9u,19,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/awlt9u/the_current_state_of_the_game/,5,The current state of the game,"Last night there was a very important post discussing the state of the game. It had over 6k likes and over 1100 comments and I feel was the first real post made in a very long time as it got the average player to vent their experiences and concerns with the current ""meta"" and how a ranked mode would fit into Fortnite, as well as the benefits that would carry, the most notable being a mode for skilled players and a mode for those just starting out or still learning.

Fortnite has become a niche game for elite players, along the lines of CS:GO and this in my view carries negatives for not only the general population but also for Epic as this game is no longer new player friendly. The skill gap has been raised considerably since S5 and has reached the point where new players have to put in a significant amount of effort to learn how to build and edit quickly. Both new players and seasoned players recognize this issue and while not everyone has a problem with it, I believe there are a ton who do have a problem of it and I don't believe Epic recognizes just how much of a problem it is for some of us.

If you started playing 6+ months ago then you've likely had time to learn a lot and master your muscle memory, but for players more recent, the game can be a nightmare right now. The game can be a nightmare if you've been around for a while but have limited time to play. There is no cut and dry solution here as it's a tricky one; building is the thing that made Fortnite popular but it is also the thing that's isolating the playerbase. The most proposed solution would be a ranked mode as this would leave casuals and new players with their own space to hone their skills and would give skilled players a system that could carry some benefits.

It's about time Epic started listening to not only skilled players and popular streamers but also the average player or the player has yet to dedicate themselves to the game in fear of being too far behind.",FortNiteBR

I don’t have time to practice all day everyday I barely get to play everyday but when I do it would be nice to go against someone of my own skill level and not some sweat or try hard.  Now there is nothing wrong with being a sweat or try hard, if you put the time into something then of course you should be good at and good for you for being great at the game. I just think that it’s not fun to fight against someone like that over and over. They build a 10 story mansion to fight someone who built a 2x2. The final circles are a mess it’s just so bad. Yea you are bound to go up against better players it’s a 100 person BR but still I’d like to think I have a chance at winning not every fight just get demolished because they have the time to put into this game. A ranked mode would be fun because then I know I’m fighting someone closer to my skill level. Or SBMM, even though it gets some hate because eventually if you are good enough you’ll be put into non stop turtle fest and yea that sounds bad but those are the people you fit in with. Turtling up at high skill is boring but also constantly getting demolished is too and is no fun. Which is why you see a lot of causals move on to tell rumble or apex.

However, it all comes down to one thing... the players. Everybody seems to be so good at building now, that i'm struggling to win any buildfights/gunfights. I would say, that 90% of the lobbies i've been in since Season 8 started has consisted of sweaty soccer skins building skyscrapers within seconds.

I feel like i'm an intermediate/advanced player myself when it comes to building, so I dread to think what it must feel like for those who have started playing in the past couple of seasons. I really feel like i'm just not enjoying the game, and, from the 50-100 games i've played this season, i've had the urge to quit on many occasions.

""We believe the three pillars of communication are:

- Compete whenever you want.
- Measure and communicate your skill. 
- Be challenged.

Pop up cups are a first small step in this direction, expect lots of iteration.""


This is a pretty vague answer which I do not like (much rather Epic be confident in giving us a detailed answer because that would mean we're more likely close to seeing a ranked mode) but it kind of points to a Ranked Mode coming eventually right?

And just all simplicity the game had, like no vehicles, the game was not overloaded with uneccasary weapons etc. And now the game is just filled with tryhards and the skill gap is way to big. And the game is just ugly it self. Like just compare the [season 2](https://gyazo.com/53449b6396cd158635d543304d35b64b) max skin and the [season 5](https://gyazo.com/061f238f7f49494dbf8f7df6503e171d) one, in my opinion the season 2 one (the black knight) is WAY better. Take a [look](https://gyazo.com/4c45857153ee8928afeaee8149f21e2e) on how simple the map were back then, and now look at [this](https://gyazo.com/f71c1d91acef192191cd9e6fb3c6678b) messy overloaded map.

But in the end, all of this gets ruined by how insanely sweaty this game is getting. Before you comment ""lmao git gud kid just build 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂 stop complaining lol"", take your time to read this. As a casual gamer, I don't play this game 24/7 and I don't have so much time to invest on doing 90s and doing ramp rushes in playground . It's sad that such an awesome game is getting ruined by the player base. Everyone is sweaty now. It's no longer important to see the Victory Royale, it's just important to see how many little casuals can you sweat and if you can get a 20 bomb every game. 
This whole system, there's no ranked, the lobbies are mixed and this is why the problem exists. Why would you put a casual gamer who plays once a week with a sweaty twitch streamer who plays daily and can build the Burj Khalifa in 0.1 seconds? It doesn't make sense, and this problem gets worse and worse every day.
More people are agreeing that this game is too sweaty. Some popular streamers are saying too. 
This game is not fun this way. And even some sweats think it isn't fun. Do you think getting a 20 bomb every game against casuals is fun? It gets even annoying.

The player base will shrink soon, less and less players will join, because everyone is gonna be a sweaty soccer skin and there will be barely a chance for new and casual players to succeed.
Epic has to do something to fix this. Ranked. Such a simple thing yet epic refuses to do it. It's so simple. Just make a ranked playlist, and put players against players of the same skill level. It'd keep the game fresh, exciting, and obviously, fun. Epic just doesn't seem to understand. Hundreds of players like me are frustrated of how unfair this game is. If you don't know how to build like a sweaty ttv soccer skin youre just an easy kill for anyone.

So this idea would not only make more money but also give some more enjoyability to people who are just entering or people who haven't really gotten the chance to play as long or as much as others. So my friend and I discussed this for a while and here was the idea we came to. Allow us to check each others inventory (skins, pickaxes, gliders, ect.) and be able to buy things from the inventory but at an inflated price (anywhere from 25%-50%). So I could go in my friends inventory, select Black Knight, and buy him for 3000 (that's %50 increase) V-bucks. For skins with selectable styles (including pickaxes) each selectable style should cost roughly 20% of what the skin would cost (and no need to buy the styles in order just the one you want). For example, Ice King: Skin costs 3000, each style costs 400 (that's 20% of the original 2000 since its a legendary skin). You could spend 3400 to get the skin witht the style you want or you could spend 4200 to get the completed skin. While, yes, this would ruin the ""OG"" thing it would be great profit for Epic Games and people who didn't get to play or couldn't afford it at the time because honestly, the whole OG argument is kinda sad. 

To clarify: Being able to buy copies of skins from friends inventory (not buy and take from their inventory, though a selling system like that would be nice as I have skins I no longer want and would gladly sell to a friend) at an inflated price of roughly 25%-50% as well as styles being roughly 20% of the rarity price (legendary:400 Epic:300).

#This weeks topic is: **Zombies**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on Zombies to base your conversation on. They have been in and out of the game a few times now and we think they deserve to have a potential overall feedback post. potential talking points are:

* Is it a more efficient way to gain loot and materials or are there better ways of looting?
* How much of an impact do zombies have late game, in terms of gameplay?
* Are they more of a useful asset to the game or an inconvenience?
* Could the spawn rate be adjusted for certain points within the game, if so, how much?
* Should loot drops from zombies provide more or less loot to provide balance?

Keep all discussion regarding this topic within this thread and give negative and positive feedback on this topic. You are free to express and discuss your feelings on this topic, its place in the current meta and anything which you may think should be changed about it.

I get it, you don't enjoy the game as much as you once did, it happens. I've had it happen with cs:go, starcraft, LoL, Guild wars 2. However, don't let nostalgia cloud your judgement into thinking it always used to be better, because it defininitly wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 1: Shotguns would deal 100 damage from 100m away, shotguns were incredibly inconsistent due to random pellet spread, this remains an issue till season 5. Scoped AR's dealt 88 damage headshots with no bloom, insanely overpowered. No first shot accuracy, once again remains an issue for a few seasons. Very basic map.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 2: Double pump started becoming prominent at this point. The negative of the slow pump fire rate was completely nullified by the fact you could just machine gun fire them. On top of this pumps would one shot wooden walls, what everyone was complaining about with the deagle. Very little weapon variety, all that was carried was  double shotgun and an AR. If you didn't have that loadout you were at a significant disadvantage.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 3: Double pump remained dominant. Basically no major meta changes from previous season so a lot of previous issues remain. C4, guided missile, port a fort, clingers all added this season, almost all hated at one point or another (clingers would blow up when a wall broke)

&amp;#x200B;

Season 4: Very few additions this season, double pump was much more in check, pretty reasonable power level at this point. Jetpacks were added which a lot of people did not like. Shotgun damage was nerfed down to 80/85 which caused complaints for 2 season about shotguns being too weak. 

&amp;#x200B;

Season 5: Oh boy have we got a good one here. Spray meta at its worst. P90, smg, drum gun, lmg all in the game at this point. Building was nerfed so that your walls felt like paper. Heavy sniper added, basically making all other snipers pointless due to how strong it is. Double barrel and grappler added, everyones favourite combo. Rift to go added which has only become an issue recently due to how key mobility is late game. This season should probably be considered the worst.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 6: A lot of backtracking this season. Spray meta issues were generally fixed, shotguns were buffed back to where they were before. Heavy AR added which is a very popular weapon. Main issues this season were the turret being added with a fucked hitbox, and fornitemares being around for 2 weeks. Other then those 2 weeks it was a solid season.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 7: Frankly, this season is one of the most polarising i've seen. It had its highs and lows. Infinity blade was clearly the low, being disgracefully overpowered. Planes were incredibly annoying for almost the whole season. However, meta wise with weapons everything was pretty solid. Deagle was op but not as op as other things in the past. Some good vaults and 7.40 probably goes down as one of the best patches adding pop up rules to pubs.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 8: Who knows, only time will tell

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Every season has its issues, some more major than other. Don't act like the game is worse now then ever before just because you aren't enjoying it as much, nostalgia clouds your vision hard. ",FortNiteBR

This is, in reality, just another post urging epic to add a ranking system to the game. Again, it’d

1. Allow newer players to practice against those of similar skill level, so improvement comes naturally and not from hours in playground mode or team rumble murdering people who’re just messing around.
2. It could add an in-game rewards system. Earn V-Bucks by placing high in the weekly/seasonly/monthly rankings. It’d add actual encouragement to improve so you could get stuff. This one may be a bit worse, but for those of us who like the shop skins but don’t want to buy V-Bucks, this would be nice.
3. On the flip side of one, it’d provide skilled players with skilled players to go up against. This would make watching pros stream much more interesting, and would keep the more ‘skilled’ out of the less ‘skilled’ games.
4. This would also shut up the entire subreddit about the topic, other than the thousand or so hecklers that will inevitably come around. (Seriously, as soon as something gets added unless it’s a banana or a fish y’all want it nerfed to death because it’s ‘OP’ and then you want it removed because it sucks.)

The only issue I can see with ranked mode would be when you’re squadding up with friends, and that could cause issues due to different skill levels. If it was me, I’d make it so you automatically go to the more ‘skilled’ servers.

Luxe obtaining new styles would fit into the new season's main theme and story of finding hidden treasures. Notice how she has a lock on her chest and how there's a general emphasis on keys. That may indicate that at one point during the season Luxe will remove the lock and obtain a new stage. You also gotta remember that Master Key exists and his golden color scheme fits Luxe's final (for now) stage.

I mean, just think about it. Having only color swaps would be pretty disappointing even for a tier 1 skin, now that Epic puts so much effort into them.

As for what Luxe might transform into, right now it's only loosely implied that she might become some sort of a dragon because of her tattoo and drawing on her spray. Although that might only be a metaphor for whatever it is Epic decides to morph her into.",FortNiteBR

I am well aware of the posts regarding that, and this is a different discussion.

As you may have noticed, ever since the Pop Up Cup settings were applied to the regular game modes, there has been a surge in posts on the subreddit about people complaining about thirsting. It doesn't bother me as much, but I understand that some people find it extremely frustrating as they are more casual players and just want to have some fun. 

My friends and I were playing the other night and we came up with this possible change to the Pop Up Cup settings that might work (of course, only in Duos and Squads). It is as follows: 

Whenever you engage another squad, you can knock players. Now, if you fully eliminate the player instantly, nothing will happen (basically the same as the game prior to the Pop Up Cup settings).

However, if your squad completely eliminates the enemy squad, then all remaining members on your team shall receive 50 health/shield after the enemy squad has been eliminated. 

My friends reasoned that this would ensure that the player who gets knocked has a higher chance of staying knocked and not being fully eliminated, because the opponent will rush to help his team eliminate the rest of the players in order to receive the 50 health/shield.

Conversely, they will still be able to instantly eliminate the knocked player if they choose to. It will give them no instantaneous advantage, except that the opposing squad will not be able to revive their fallen teammate. 

What do you think of this hypothetical change? Do you think it will work in the game? Or is it unreasonable? I would like to get the opinion of other players on this. Please note that I am not complaining about the current settings, just discussing about a different option.",FortNiteBR

[Rant]","When I first started playing in the backend of season 3, there were a lot less people BM'ing/Thirsting, and I had many fun games. I had moments of letting people go get loot, and have a chance to win themselves, I had a Fishman hop into a shopping cart while I wheeled him around old racetrack, I got disappointed that I couldnt get green omega because of level, but I knew even when it was lame, the game was still fair, and people were barely trying to win every single game, and you could have fun in our silly battle Royale. Now EVERYBODY thirsts, goes for kills even if you are just enjoying the game or playing challenges, and no one even seems to be caring about the old days. This season has the best set up to be the best silliest season ever! You freaking FLY out of a CANNON like Sonic the Hedgehog for crying out loud!  
But everywhere I go I see ""Defaults"" and Soccer skins and other dumb skins that let you know ""Hey, I play this game so much, if I tried to stand up from my gamer chair I would get 7 different kinds of carpal tunnel and arthritis, because I only want to win and show you I can pull off 90s and pyramid jumps and other moves you probably won't know because you have a life."" Its really hard to enjoy a game casually when there is a complaint every other moment about the ""meta"" or stuff like that. And I had my moments of that. But I say to those people. Please, when private matchmaking is a thing, please exclusively use it. I'm not spending 3-4 hours just to get to your level so you can rage quit if I kill you or something. I'm steamed thinking that people have the audacity to say that if we want to have fun on Fortnite, we should play a different game. I'm starting to feel like I should, considering the people who say that have been making money for winning. I'd rather just get a Nintendo Switch and play Smash Bros.   


  
I will lose all hope if there aren't full server Congo lines. If sweaty players just want kills and stats, play Apex. No build techniques, just grindy, shooty, stat based Titanfall BR. Or play on Switch servers, or East, if you still want to play. If you wanna jack up your wins, do it in Squads! Hardly anyone cares about Solo Tournaments anyway, its more fun to watch   
squads work it out. Its why most Youtubers/Streamers hardly play by themselves, and why Apex forces you into teams.  
You can feel my frustration looking at some of Wildcat's tweets.

&amp;#x200B;

With Fortnite losing money, it can only come down to 2 reasons. 1, its dying down, which is okay, its still fun to mess with, but 2, people are taking it too seriously. This is the same game with a giant walking banana, Llamas that you can beat the snot out of to get free stuff, Cannons as vehicles to shoot yourself from, 3 food mascots fighting it out in the midst of world altering catastrophes, living meteors, dance grenades, teddy bears, ATVs, Hoverboards, a freaking actual musician, and a bunch of other stuff to make this a NOT serious game, and yet when you look at how people are treating it, you might as well be clocking in when you start playing, cause if you aren't earning money, you aren't having fun. I hope that changes, with a casual and ranked mode. Maybe make it so if you have 50 wins or more, ranked is unlocked, and then its like the overwatch badge system. If you are top fifty and above, you get positive bonus, fifty and below, no or negative bonus (In case ur Mythic and you get pounced by a Common for example) And then you can be put into games based on your ""Rarity"" or rank. Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythic. They can earn cool slightly exclusive skins and stuff as a bonus for being good, and not trying to just clown on pub matches all the time.  


At the end of the day, Fortnite is a game originally based on fighting Zombs, that got a Battle Royale taped on, and has become one of the most popular and profited Battle Royales in recent years. Please consider that its not just for you players who are so good you could play console with your eyes closed when you've been playing on PC for so long.   


I'd rather just enjoy meeting a friend on the battlefield who might drop me a revolver, and then we do battle with just the scoped revolvers cause we're stupid and want the win, but in a way that isnt just outbuilding.

So, first off, take a look at the luxe skin. You can see that she has a snake tattoo on her arm. She also has a padlock on her necklace. Maybe later on in the season we will have something just like the prisoner and will have to find keys around the map to unlock her other styles. I have evidence to back this up as well: in the battle pass you can see that there is a skeleton key spray (tier 36). Maybe it’s to unlock her necklace? Also this next theory maybe a little far fetched but maybe Master Key ( the skin) is connected to luxe. When you look at him, you can see that there are a bunch of keys on him. Could those be for her padlock? 

Next, in the battle pass luxe has her own spray. In the background you see that there is some sort of snake or dragon type animal in the background ( the spray is on tier 90).  She seems to have a theme with snakes if you pay close attention to the set. Like for example, the pickaxe has little snake heads at the top surrounding a diamond. And one more thing ( which may be irrelevant) her eyes . With the different colors of clothing she has, her eyes change. This may just be me, but they kinda remind me of snake eyes.

Lastly, which may seem a little out there but I’ll mention it anyway, the set she is apart of is called “24k”  which is gold and precious gems. On her pickaxe, like I said before, has a diamond on it. Now, we have a volcano on the map now. And if you didn’t know, pressure from within the volcano creates diamonds. So, what I’m trying to say here is, luxe could be connected to the volcano, the snake eggs, or even the fire king.

In conclusion, we should pay attention to detail more before jumping to conclusions. I think the luxe skin has A LOT of potential, and I have faith in Epic Games. I know that they have some kind of trick up their selves! They’re not done with Luxe yet. ;)

When someone here makes a topic talking about how wide the skill gap is from match to match they aren't saying *""EPIC PLS GIB ME FREE WINS!""* like how most good players assume. The most common reply here when someone posts about the skill discrepancy is just *""lol git good bot""* which would be  valid advice if not for it being impossible when you get clapped in 3 seconds after coming across a new player. 

Since people love Esports so much here's a sporting comparison - imagine barely being able to play basketball and being matched up with someone from the NBA. The twist? They're not playing for fun or to teach you - they're playing like it's the NBA Finals and their shoes are rigged to explode if they lose. The person who doesn't know  how to play won't learn anything because as soon as the whistle goes off they'll get stomped.

Also, to cover another popular reply by good players when people from way back in S3 or even earlier say they got good without stuff like skill based matchmaking and ranked they're conveniently forgetting that back then, *everyone was terrible in the game.* I saw old videos of BR gameplay and practically no one knew how to build and simply remembering that you could put up a wall between you and an enemy at any given time was considered a pro strategy.

Now here's the thing - for a lot of these people they don't want to be a terrible player forever. A lot of them do want to put in the time and effort into being at least halfway decent in the game eventually but doing 1x1's and 90s in Playground or Creative is only gonna get you so far. Knowing from experience it doesn't matter how well you could do those in a controlled environment when in a real match you instantly get clapped by someone before you even have time to apply what you've been practicing.",FortNiteBR

After about 6 hours of research, here are my tips. 

I spent the first 5 hours and 30 minutes landing at the little racetrack outside Junk Junction. I would get two of the quadcrasher all neatly lined up, grab the nearest weapon and stand on top of quads waving for anyone who might pass. As if trying to say, ""Hey, I got us these vehicles, scratch my back and I will scratch yours."" Note that I was doing this in solo queue.

For 5 and a half hours I was mercilessly tore down by every single person that came across me. I tried laying my weapons down... nope. I tried building a giant heart... nope. I tried everything to accomplish this peacefully. but with no luck.

So in short, my actual suggestion is BAIT CAR! Take a quadcrasher, and drive it somewhere out in the open. Take place crouching in a nearby bush and simply wait. In my experience, anyone who happens upon it will get on with no questions asked. At least long enough for you to get a few sneak attacks in on the vehicle.

It’s not the actual sweatiness of the game that will kill it, what kills it is the sweatiness getting what they want to make being sweaty easy. Every time Epic adds something that’s fun and different it gets shit on immediately for “killing competitive”. This isn’t CSGO, this isn’t Rainbow 6, this isn’t COD. Battle Royale games weren’t made to be MLG. But the community has done a good job making high level play fun to watch. But then the inevitable cycle happens where a new season starts or a patch drops, something new is added, the “competitive players” lose to it because it counter building or something, we get 500 posts asking for it to be removed even though tons of people are having fun with it, and then we go back to whoever can build better (aka whoever sinks the most time in) wins.

That’s what’s going to kill the game. Anything even remotely casual is lobbied against immediately if it helps a random get a kill against someone who thinks they’re pro. “THEY SHOULDNT BE ABLE TO DESTROY MY BUILD THAT EASY”, sick. But let’s not complain when the game is literally just sweaty players left and no longer regularly updated because it’s all just “pro players” like Counter Strike",FortNiteBR

1. Season 4 \~ This season had my absolute FAVORITE cosmetics, changed the way of the game completely, and had the coolest live event. My favorite.
2. Season 7 \~ Though the live event was not very impressive, this season was still memorable because of the cosmetics and the storyline, it being the first season after the end of the Cube storyline.
3. Season 5 \~ Though the cosmetics weren't as awesome, the live events this season were great. My favorite part was when the Cube moved around the map.
4. Season 3 \~ None of us will ever forget the Reaper or the release of Tilted Towers. ESPECIALLY the mysterious comet.
5. Season 2 \~ No map changes were really made, but this season had the first battle pass and all of the OG locations.
6. Season 8 \~ The volcano is an interesting addition to the map, though the storyline is a bit jumbled and not much changed other that the northeast corner of the map, for the ice is still in this season. The cosmetics aren't too bad but not my favorite. Overall, it just feels like Season 7 with a volcano.
7. Season 1 \~ There was no battle pass this season, but the OG map and skins still stick in our heads.
8. Season 6 \~ Barely anything was new this season, and it was fairly disappointing after the desert was added in S5. All we got was a floating island and the rune-areas changed a bit. Yes, this season had the biggest live event in the game, but the time after that was dull.

There have been countless times where we're killed by someone doing Tfue-esque edits/builds that pique our suspicion, then we stay to watch them play and can easily confirm they're using mouse + keyboard.  They often will have 10-15 kills (not saying controllers couldn't do this, but the obvious kb+m players achieve these numbers frequently) and it's clearly unbalanced.  I know PS4 allows for kb+m now, but anyone using them you need to be put in lobby with other players using the same equipment.

432,MrPopoTFS,1551478577,awagpo,355,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/awagpo/packet_reordering_technical_post/,1080,Packet Reordering - Technical Post,"We recently tracked down, with the help of an internet service provider (ISP) and one of our hosting providers, a networking issue that could be contributing to some of the lag and packet loss that players with certain ISPs are experiencing. This post is to provide some technical details about the problem and how we’re planning to fix it.

&amp;nbsp;

The issue relates to how UDP network packets can be delivered to their destination in a different order than they were sent. This is a protocol that all programs using UDP for networking have to deal with, and Fortnite, by way of Unreal Engine 4, does handle it, but not as efficiently as it could. 

&amp;nbsp;

To help understand the issue, here’s a simplified version of the high-level sequence of events that occur in a single frame in-game.

&amp;nbsp;

1. Try to read a packet from the network, if one is available, go to #2. Otherwise, skip to #4.

2. If the packet read was sent before a packet we’ve already processed, discard it. Otherwise, process it normally.

3. Go back to #1.

4. Advance the game simulation and wait for the next frame.

&amp;nbsp;

We can do the test in #2 because the sender writes a sequence number into each packet they send, and the receiver records this number for the last packet it successfully processed. Discarding packets with lower sequence numbers is important for keeping the game simulation consistent, as well as for security reasons - we can’t just process every single packet regardless of when it’s received.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, consider a case where the packets the game receives are out-of-order. For example, if the received sequence is 1, 3, 2, 4, following the steps above, we would process packet 1, then 3, discard 2, then process 4.

Discarding packets here is generally OK, because we have mechanisms to retransmit packets if needed - but this retransmission takes time, so in effect it causes increased latency for whatever actions would have been triggered by processing that packet.

&amp;nbsp;

However, the game did receive every packet the sender sent, and it technically could have processed packet #2, so dropping it might seem wasteful - and it is!

&amp;nbsp;

If the out-of-order packets are all received on the same game frame, we should be able to sort them into the correct order before fully processing them. Consider this revised processing loop:

&amp;nbsp;

1. Read all packets available from the network. If any are available, go to #2. Otherwise, skip to #4.

2. Sort all packets received by their sequence numbers.

3. Process all the packets in their now-sorted order.

4. Advance the game simulation and wait for the next frame.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, we can process all the packets received in the example above without discarding any and paying for the re-transmission time of whatever data packet #2 contained!

&amp;nbsp;

We hope to have the revised processing method implemented in the v8.10 update but will update you on the timing for the fix closer to the release of that patch.

&amp;#x200B;

Seth here from the BR Audio team. We’ve seen you talking about some of the Audio adjustments that occurred with Season 8 as well as general feedback on the sounds you hear. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s dig in on some upcoming improvements we’re working on!

* Improvement to the standard AR sound so that it's not overbearing on the shooter.
   * Tightened up the sound, so it’s more of a BLaaam versus a BLAAAM.
* Building Piece destroy sound is louder when instigated by enemies.
   * Helps mitigate scenarios where ""that guy Hand Cannon'd a wall behind me and I didn't hear it"".
* Footstep audio blends in the above/below layers, rather than abruptly switching between them.
   * Prevents jarring footstep transitions between floors directly above or below. Should clear up some confusion.
* Footstep occlusion traces from the heads of enemies when they're above or below.
   * This helps mitigate scenarios where an enemy has line-of-sight on you but their footsteps still sound muffled/occluded.
* Reduce volume of the S8 palm tree umbrella.
   * This only affects the umbrella open/close layers. Don’t worry, the steel drum riff volume is preserved. :)

1.) Don’t watch streamers who use it

That's really stupid, me and my friends are TIRED just because we were 2nd just because they killed us from behind like freaking unexperienced players. Shooting from behind should be banneable, or atleast you shouldn't be able to take damage if someone shoots you from behind.",FortNiteBR

When streamers are putting up 35 40 kill games every single day you know there is a problem. I used to play about 4-5 hours a day peak season 3 and 4 and I always wanted shield/health per kill but with the skill gap widening so much I think it was a bad time to add it late last season.  Call me a bot or whatever but fortnite is simply too rage inducing with the amount of people who are crazy good and I simply don’t have the time to catch up with real responsibilities in life. It was a great ride fortnite but catch me on apex now. ,FortNiteBR

I'm that weirdo who tries to hide out all game, but then I'll walk out and let you shoot me if it gets down to 2. I know, I know, this isn't hide and seek. But I'm crap at shooting and this is the way I have fun. ANYWAY, thanks to the player who threw snowballs at me instead of shooting me. When you got lost in the storm I got my first ever win. It's okay if you shoot me next time, but I had fun.

What pushed it to perfection was how easily obtainable mats are and how I never have to waste a bunch of time farming. Another thing is getting a reward for killing people by getting healed.

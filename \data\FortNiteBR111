I dont really use it. Its not my thing. But. This brings up a matter that is important. The developers needs to stop consistantly vaulting things. Its getting annoying. At this point they are vaulting more than they are actually balancing. I usually dont complain about epic and there development moves, but I just feel that I should say this. Lets go over some things thst where vaulted now.

Double Barrel: Yea it could do insane damage, but only if you where insanely close. Imo balanced.

Six Shooter: Its a gun that was not meant to be OP. The problem with it was that it was WAY too common as floor loot. You could tweak that.

Guided Missle (I think): i have not seen any on non playground modes, but I am not completely sure if its vaulted. This weapon was amazing at scouting and looking for enemies. Not doing any damage or breaking things was perfect for it.


The point is, most of the weaponry are not bad weapons generally. People will complain, thats what the fortnite community does best, but they get used to it. You can find great use for every weapon in the game by a little bit of tweaking. Lets go over some weapons that may be vaulted.

Heavy Shotgun
Thermal Scoped AR
Scoped AR
Hunting Riffle

Thats all that could come to mind right now, but you see. These weapons could have awesome poetential if they are used right. Right now the thermal scoped AR is perfect for spotting people in the misty snow map. Add fog around haunted or wailing. Come on epic. Be clever and stop vaulting consistantly.",FortNiteBR

These old effects are what made this game stand out just that much more to me. It was such a beautiful-looking game in its own ways.

Like fuck anybody is doing this. Iv been playing or of ice storm and iv been on the lucky side of things by seeing 3 of them, one of which actually counted towards the challenge. The spawn rate is absurd for these and although hard to kill, I have no problems with that as they drop a legendary. The spawn rate is an issue.

In the viking village there is a very unique pattern on the wood that the ship is made from. These markings can be combined into the fire kings symbol! This is very interesting because as a part of the season 7 map changes the waterfall froze over in viking village but it now is connected to a river that never existed before which spills out into a BRAND NEW FROZEN LAKE. This lake is right at the base of polar peak and would be a logical endpoint for the ship if the fire king were to unfreeze the island.  On top of this the ship is carrying loads of unknown barrels that may be explosives of some sort. This is all adding up in an odd way because on top of this MatPat brought up a point about the season 4 ARG which was that epic(not as huge a company at the time) would never do so much without it paying off into something. What was rifted out? The Durr Burger and rifted in were the vikings with their anchor. Ragnarok then came the following season. I see two possibilities either the vikings are aligned with the fire king or one of them IS the fire king. We shall see but anyway its just a theory and if you made it this far thanks for listening to my ramblings.

That means my mates are usually on the same boat as me i.e. get on on a Monday night after work for a couple hours. The problem is when they Constantly join my party even though I've explained I'm on to play with my friends I just get the same reply ""ready up"" or they just continue to giggle at themselves because they know they aren't supposed to be in the lobby. 

Please Epic, to avoid these awkward encounters with my nephews and not to have them think I am being rude, could you add 'Appear offline' as an option.

All of the major in game events are happening where the rocket warped from. So potentially the next event could happen near Tilted Towers or in the sky, since the rocket teleported above Tilted in the start, and finally went into the sky at the end. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this theory could be true. Please share this \[btw please give me credit if u do share :-)\]

I have my sensitivity on fairly low so it‚Äôs hard to whip round and actually build for cover. 

Now that keyboard and mouse is available I thought I would give it ago because it seems so much more designed or easier to build/aim

My god I am I terrible. I tried for a few days and I literally cannot do anything. I‚Äôve tried re-binding the keys but I have no idea how you all do it so well and fast. I‚Äôve watched a few videos but they basically just say re-bind keys. 

I dunno wether I should just stick with what I know now (control pad) or just try harder to use keyboard and mouse.

They can't even see the mic icon move when i speak, although i see it move on my screen. I know the mic works because when i play with other xbox players i can use party chat to talk. But if i want to play cross platform, it is impossible. I have tried all the ""fixes"". So please don't tell me to turn voice chat off then back on.

In those two hours, I've killed like 45/100 Brutes and 110/250 Fiends. At this rate, it's going to take me at least 5 hours of playing just to do those two challenges. There's like 9 more. 

For starters, if you land in a vacant corner of the map to farm, you're not even going to have time to kill anything because you'll have maybe 3 minutes to do so before you have to run to the circle. 

If you land somewhere close to the first circle and start farming, you're just going to get clapped by someone who raided a POI and has guns and loot while you're killing monsters with a white tactical shotgun.

If by the grace of god you land in the circle **AND** get good loot to farm, the monsters basically spawn at rates of either 0 or 1 per 'spawn' from the pylon, meaning you're going to need to wait for at least 200+ 'spawns' to kill everything you need.

These challenges are utterly ridiculous and it's impossible to play the game the way it's meant to be played while completing these challenges.

Thermal ARs are useful all of a sudden, the game starts to accommodate stealth plays.  You can also use the fog to surprise enemies and rush them.  

Now I know that the fog will be gone in a few days but me and my friend have discussed an idea,  that perhaps the fog could come back at random spots in games in the future to introduce a bit more variety to the gameplay.  A bit like how like games play at night sometimes.  (Shout out to Lazer Minion for that idea)

In Fortnite‚Äôs current state, there are certain weapons that are too powerful at long range. Put yourself into this situation: you just got out of a fight with very low health. You box yourself in to heal up. You notice some at least 150 meters away shooting at you with a hand cannon or an assault rifle, rendering you unable to heal without getting killed. This happens to me and so many others a countless number of times. 

What I am suggesting is damage dropoff to structures for assault rifles, submachine guns, and hand cannons to return. Hand cannons should only be able to one-shot walls when they are fairly close. I don‚Äôt see Epic vaulting high mobility items such as planes, quadcrashers, rifts, atks, shopping carts, gliders, or balloons in the near future (which allow for constant third parties), so this is what I see as the best alternative.

I'm just another guy who enjoys playing Fortnite from time to time, and the newest Ice Storm gamemode has been... frustrating, to say the least. I want to talk about what issues I've been seeing with the new gamemode as well as why I feel like we really didn't need a reskin Fortnitemares for the end of January. I'll do some sort of TL;DR at the end.

First and foremost, the issues. The meta's somewhat shifted back towards farming these monsters for loot, which on its own is fine, and people are taking advantage of it, which is also fine. However, as the circle starts getting smaller, the pillars go from being annoying and a nuisance to literally screwing up your gameplay and causing you to die. It makes it so that playing ultra passively and hidden away from everyone else, skirting the edge of every single zone is the meta. It's a meta that gets very old very quickly, and that leads right into my second point. Even if you wanted to change the fact that pillars start threatening your life and decided to destroy every pillar as quickly as possible with, say, a couple sticks of dynamite or something, Epic decided to add something to the late game that makes it so you can't just blow up the pillars anyway - the brutes. I've got no clue how much health these dudes have, but what I do know is that when you're dealing with around of five other players within a circle less than a tenth of the map in area, the last thing you want to be doing is drawing attention to yourself trying to deal with the titanic brute that you have while the other people are either forced to do the same or have played so passively that they actually get an advantage. \*\*\*Yes, this is an opinion,\*\*\* but I feel like purely passive behavior should not be rewarded with wins. And yet, exactly that can happen. I literally won a game because I had nine uses of a grapple gun and ran away from the other three players as well as all the tanky zombies following them and attacking them, rather than trying to aggressively kill the players. I feel like that's a major issue that should really be looked at by Epic.

All of that aside, I feel like doing a reskin Fortnitemares is just lazy of Epic if nothing else. If they're allowed to just make reskin Fortnitemares every three months, they aren't really introducing anything new or crazy to the mix, or any fun map changes. Sure, covering the whole map in snow is fun and all, but it didn't really change anything - All of the water outside of the originally frozen corner of the map isn't frozen over- it's still regular water, so no change there. Vision's reduced pretty majorly in the early game, but that's really about it for new changes. I feel like without new changes, the game's going to get staler and more frustrating to play, as it'll just be a cycle between zombies and no zombies. I want to see something fresh from Epic every so often and not the same recycled content. That's my problem with a reskin Fortnitemares.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - The endgame's pretty much ruined by the new event, forcing passive play and punishing players for things outside of their control. In addition, the event itself is a blatant reskin of Fortnitemares, which doesn't really add anything new to the mix aside from reduced vision in the early game.

Remove some useless/old items to fix it,"There are way too many items that don‚Äôt have a place in the meta. These items are useless and make this game even more random. You are now more likely to die due to finding something that isn‚Äôt nearly as good as what the enemy got.

The following items won‚Äôt hurt to be removed:

Grenade launcher doesn‚Äôt work now that camping in forts really isn‚Äôt the meta anymore. All the other explosive work just fine.

Bush: This item is completely useless. Of all the items vaulted I‚Äôm surprised this hasn‚Äôt been the first thing to go.

Thermal scoped AR: These really don‚Äôt get used that much at all. The thermal scope is kinda gimmicky and doesn‚Äôt help that much in practice.

Rift to go: There‚Äôs plenty of mobility already. Th me enemy is most likely just going to follow you and finish the job anyways.

Boomboxes: These are annoying and require no skill. Not to mention this is most likely not even fun for casual players anyways. It‚Äôs just frustrating and I don‚Äôt wanna find these.

Turrets: When These things are balanced they still don‚Äôt have good enough use. They encourage camping which is contrary to the very idea of battle Royale. Most importantly, they make it harder to find traps, launchpads, and campfires. 

Glider: This mechanic is sort of balanced I guess but it isn‚Äôt very useful in its currents form. People don‚Äôt run away all the time but it just doesn‚Äôt get used enough to justify it being in the item pool. At the very least they need to completely rework redeploy but that‚Äôs a whole another discussion.",FortNiteBR

I don't know what else to do.

The Thermal AR is vastly underused because in the majority of cases, it's outright \*worse\* than the Scoped AR, it's only benefit being thermal scope, which is again, useless at the range it's designed for anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

So perhaps, if the Thermal AR got vaulted, they could add a Tactical Sniper Rifle (to differentiate it from Semi-Auto, the vaulted weapon)

&amp;#x200B;

It would look something like this:

https://i.redd.it/9odlaplrymb21.png

As in, it has a normal scope, but a small circle around the center (half the radius of the full circle-ish) would be thermal. Combine this with semi-auto firing and perhaps the return of Smoke Bombs, and you got one hell of a tacti-cool weapon.",FortNiteBR

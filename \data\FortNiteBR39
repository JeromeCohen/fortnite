Blades, Stormwings, Boom Boxes oh my! Not as many of the professionals were playing as often due to the ""unbalanced"" nature of the game at it's current state. But then...Patch 7.40...

Hand Cannon and Stormwing nerfs, zipline interact button, overtime challenges, free battle pass, and Siphon! It was most certainly one of the largest non-season Fortnite updates to ever come to the game. But at the time...Fortnite still had a rival, in the form of A P E X. Many of the players playing Fortnite had switched over to Legends because it was a new and fresh BR experience, but of course, that didn't last long...

Pirates, Volcanoes, Adventure, Treasure...a Banana? Season 8 truly started of as a rather odd season, but it soon became loved due to how balanced and fresh the game felt. But after the hype started die down, something became quite abundant...people weren't having much fun.

The idea of Siphon is fantastic: Health/Shield per elimination, Mats per elimination, higher harvesting rate; who couldn't love Siphon? And hey, the pros enjoyed it too!...which caused quite the conundrum. With Siphon settings now in core modes, the ""sweats"" as many people say, no longer had to go into pop-up gamemodes to get the rules they wanted, which meant...lots and lots of smurfing (going into lower ranked games to get easy wins or eliminations). Because these higher skilled players often go for more eliminations, they ended up gaining full sheilds and full HP much too often, making it incredibly difficult on less aggressive players. This is where casuals started to get really frustrated, with Epic's data showing that they were playing much less overall and staying far away from core modes. While many can understand how that piece of data was obtained, most don't see how Epic could see that we were getting frustrated, since there wasn't any type of ingame pole to measure our enjoyment at the time. This confusion of where this data came from comes from the common misconception that Epic doesn't listen to their community.

Ever notice how not as many people are complaining about ""sweats"" after Siphon was removed? The complaints still exist, but not on such a large scale. Everyone on just about every platform around the start of week two in Season 8 were asking for a ranked mode in full force, saying that it would help the unbalance that the community faced. And in 8.20...a ranked mode was added, but it did also unfortunately remove Siphon.

Many have said that Siphon had no need to be removed from core modes due to the introduction of Arena. While on paper that sounds completely true, in practice it wouldn't work well. Remember, the core reason that more high skilled players were in pubs in the first place was due to the Siphon and Material rules. Epic knew that to get more of the pros into Arena instead of normal playlists, they had to to make a sacrifice, and that had to unfortunately be the Pop-Up rules.

Just as many of you, I want Pop-Up rules back. It made the game feel so much faster and exciting, and I felt that I could really bring out my true skill level when playing with it activated. However, I'm not trying to think of only my wants, I want to think of what is best for the game. If Siphon and the material changes are causing that much of the community to be frustrated because of the professionals being in public playlists, It hurts me to say that I don't believe that these rules should be present within the basic modes.

This is why your game is dying, it is not fun. You aren't treating your employees well, competitive is garbage, SMG sprayers get to win every game because they are trash. Just please for the love of god, keep the bad players OUT if you dont want them to play. Force them to play a gamemode where they can play with OTHER players who are just like them, (K/D based or Win-rate based, idk figure it out)

BUT PLEASE, for the love of god nerf smgs, or just remove them for the game. This meta has kept good players out of the World Cup, or other tournaments that have money prizes. Literally lost 50% of my games and points in Arena mode (DUO) because of SMG sprayers mowing down my friend and I because we dont have anymore mats due to spraying weapons having almost literally 70 ammo magazines (one exception, minigun)

&amp;#x200B;

What did this game turn into, I used to play this crap all day long in Season 2/3/4/5 but when the P90 came it just ruined the meta completely. Single pump meta or Single shotgun with NO smgs was really fun for season 5, but it only lasted a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Would really love the P90 and the Silenced SMG to be removed, or atleast a fire rate downgrade, as it would improve the meta quite a lot. Just make it easy on the community and dont help the bad players win, THEY HAVE PLAYGROUND AND CREATIVE to improve.

&amp;#x200B;

REWARD the good players, NOT just destroy the game for them and make them quit. Don't make another mistake as you did with removing the 50 shield per kill update.

These are the things they removed by removing the ''SIPHON'' update.

FOV slider doesnt harm anyone. Pros have every right to whine. Anyone who opposes FOV slider just for the sake of denying the pros what they want has issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say that there are two groups of people playing fortnite. Comp players and casual players. Lets make that 3 actually. Casuals, Competitors and Pros. Yes, competitors and pros are different. Pros qualify for tournaments and win money. Competitors play arena and average at around 200 points or play pubs and have a K/D of about 2. Now the pros are a very small group and the biggest group is easily the casuals, but don't underestimate the size of the competitors. There's alot of people actually trying to get better at the game and learning builds and game strategies. The casuals might be greater in numbers, but if you tabulate the hours played for each group I think the difference between competitors and casuals would not be as sharp. The middle group is the group that makes fortnite an actual game which you can play, and not just an open world where people can run around and break trees shoot some bullets. The opinion of this middle group cannot lightly be cast aside by saying that they are not the majority. Any game needs half decent players present in the game to survive.

I have seen some people on this sub and a lot of people on other subs supporting the recent blogpost by saying ""Pros are so selfish and entitled they dont realise that this game doesnt belong to them and their opinion doesnt matter because they are in the minority"".

There's a couple of issues with this statement. Firstly, anyone has the right to be angry if their demands are not met, especially considering the competitors had alot of options that were taken away from them right before the world cup. If they are mad about it, let them voice their opinions and call epic whatever they want to.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, and more importantly, people are acting like there is a conflict between the different groups of fortnite players. Why are casuals hating on pros so much? What harm have they done to you? If their demands are met, how will that harm you? The pros are not against the casual community. The casual community is a big reason the pros are millionaires and can play in such high reward tournaments. No pro wants to make the game unplayable for casuals.

&amp;#x200B;

An FOV slider will not damage the casual experience. Pros and Competitors dont even play pubs where most of the casuals reside. And if you're still scared, what is wrong with a slider in just arena mode? Yes the pros are whining for it. Why shouldn't they? They are being denied something that has no negative impacts and is still being kept from them. In the blog post epic said that they want pros to play the same game that the casuals play just in case the casuals are watching them. But you already have siphon/mats per kill/faster farming in comp modes. That already makes the game very very different. And plus scrims are a completely different type of game altogether that no casual can ever dream of in pubs. 20 extra degrees in the FOV will not so drastically change the viewing experience for casuals that they wont have any clue whats going on. Everyone asking for an FOV slider doesn't hate casuals and wants to pub stomp. They are just asking for everyone to get what they want. Unfortunately for some reason, some people have made it their mission to stop the pros from getting what they want, even if said people aren't affected by it in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

My request to every hating on the pros is : please don't. Its fine if you don't want the changes the pros want, altho i don't understand why you wouldn't. But don't hate on them for asking for something they want that won't even affect you.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I'm sort of fine with siphon not being in pubs because the kind of people who are filling pubs rn would be crushed if half decent players went back to pubs because of siphon. I'd love mats per kill tho.",FortNiteBR

The turbo build post was unpinned from shortly after [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bhpw8k/turbo_building_initial_structure_build_timer/eluxlab/) had risen to the top laying out the timeline so I doubt many people have seen it.

In order to alleviate this unfair advantage, I‚Äôm asking the community to please only turn in right hand movements in order to keep it a level playing field for me. I‚Äôm afraid the rules in the upcoming cup are going to have to change as well. I can‚Äôt afford a new controller until the tournament is over (using my winnings on a mouse that has aim insist pre-installed) so there needs to be a ban on turning left during the finals. This works out well because only cretins turn left for their 90‚Äôs. 

I really appreciate everyone‚Äôs support and look forward to your cooperation on the battle field.

PS. If I see too many people turning left I will report you! This game needs to be balanced and this is the only fair measure available. 

PPS. Also I‚Äôve been working a lot and haven‚Äôt had a lot of time to practice so in turn I‚Äôve been getting outplayed quite frequently. I‚Äôll save this for a future post, but be prepared to have editing nerfed and you can only edit a wall once it‚Äôs done being built. The other option will be a ban on practicing.

It has been 3 months since the event finished 90 \[DAYS\]. there are around 20 people who have NOT been paid with a total earning of over $100,000 combined as shown in a quick list we tried to all put together for someone at epic to see but we have all been pretty much ignored upon trying to make contact, here is just a couple picture regarding whats happened as proof.

it should be more balanced like this:

explosive radius damage: 50
when hit an additional damage is applied by :45 (headshot 70)


and it should cost ATLEAST 3 shotgun pellets, maybe even more. or even rockets...

PART 1: POINT OF INTERESTS

After the leaked eruption the island of fortnite will completely break down (not literally) there will be a hospital on the divot. (We will get to that later) salty springs will be bigger (might have like nine houses instead of five) to help the homeless survivors of retail and tilted. Fatal fields will be bigger with more crops to help feed the homeless. Haunted hills will be bigger due to more deaths. Junk junction will increase in size due to the ruins of tilted and retail (more on this later). Snobby shores will change its name and will be a giant location on the map with way more houses as well as a better way up to Viking village that leads to snobby shores. Polar peak will crack and fall onto greasy grove destroying quite a lot of it but durrr will be back! Greasy grove will be bigger with a collapsed castle resting on it. Frosty flights turn into a homeless shelter for the survivors of the eruption. The bottom of polar peak will melt revealing a leviathan (or something else). Happy hamlet will get a dock or will get bigger. The ice near yonder yards will melt revealing flush factory but destroyed (could be called flushed factory as it was washed away). The grass around lucky could turn into a bamboo forest.paradise will have signs up saying homeless welcome. Lonely lodge will be burnt a bit up north but down south will have more cabins. Sunny steps will be covered in molten rock. Lazy lagoon will turn from water to rock with the ship slightly tilted. The block will stay. Pleasant park will have a homeless shelter where the football area is now. Loot lake will have that vault. And the second best for second last is the tilted building (the one that always gets destroyed) IT WILL REMAIN COMPLETELY UNHARMED!! And finally is dusty divot! It will fill up from molten rock and will go back to the way it was leaving tons of room for a giant hospital! Dusty depot will return and will be filled with supplies for the homeless and everyone on the island (it's not just that I want it back it just fits in the storyline).

PART 2: UNAMED LOCATIONS

There will be more roads around the map with tons of ambulances going back and thorth. Campsites will show up more regularly (like 3 tents and a campfire in the middle). The hero mansion will be more broken with lava at the bottom. A lot more aim bases will be around helping the homeless. Pirate bases will be destroyed and abandoned. Homeless shelters will be scattered across the map. Factories will return but closer to dusty depot. Containers will return but bigger and up near dusty. The sledge place will become a motel with a bus stop and a new design for the sledge. A new nomes store will open near salty. A tomato head building will appear at the pirate base hill between salty and fatal.

PART 3: THE NEW AREA

The butterfly event realm will appear at loot. The three Mountains to the left will be covered as well with the middle one getting a cool white castle that fits with the theme of the area. When you look into the sky you can see the rift butterflies flying around. Where the centre of loot lake is now will be a hole like in the event where if you go in it it will hold you in the middle of the hole and a screen shows up asking you to vote (you can still be shot to avoid camping). When you go into the area the sky turns white but when looking at the area from any where else it is normal blue sky. Up North of loot lake is a town with white houses. 

PART 4: START OF SEASON 9

The teaser pictures of season 9 will have the caption of ‚Äôhelp the survivors‚Äô the first picture will have a destroyed clock tower in the middle with season 9 at the top. The second will have a destroyed nomes building with season 9 at the top. And finally the third will showcase the tier 1 skin. The trailer will show durrr burger and tomato head with broken arms and legs limping together over to the hospital. Then a giant butterfly will rise out of loot lake and will fly around the map before going to loot lake and exploding creating the new area. Durrr and tomato will look at loot lake then at each other nod then run off with a nurse skin chasing after them.

PART 5: BATTLE PASS

The two tier one skins will be a jonsey which evolves into a scavenger like skin. A Ramirez skin which evolves into a doctor skin. A season 4 trailer music pack. A needle pickaxe. A toxic waste skin. A llama pet with 3 styles: normal, dead and dragon. A daydream music pack. An STW music pack. A rift butterfly skin. And another mechanic is the over time challenges is when you reach tier 100 you get overtime challenges when completed gives you a mythic skin. 

PART 6: EXTRA STYLES

Havoc will get a style (name and description makes sense). Beef boss and tomato head will get a bandages style. Beef boss will get a frozen head style. Onesie will get a tomato head style. 

PART 7: STORYLINE

We can all agree the best storyline is season 4 now it's bad so the storyline should get straight into it. During season 9 the ruins of tilted and retail will be collected and sent to junk junction. The locations will come back but different or just replaced

LTM's are decent but get stale very quickly compared to the normal modes.  

Normal modes have gotten extremely stale for me with the removal of mats/health on kill. Some may disagree but personally it is much more boring now than before.

Arena is getting to the point where it's unplayable. I'm in champions right now and so I always get decently challenging games which is alright at the start but I get massive delay, stutters and extremely low FPS end game which often limits me and results in me preforming much worse. Every single endgame has the same FPS issues and I am probably going to stop playing cause of that paired with being matched with PC players which again is alright but paired with the terrible FPS and stutters puts me at a horrible disadvantage. 

Lastly creative. The only mode I enjoy right now only because im having fun with friends and can fight constantly.

 However the map we have is small and extremely easy to travel across. There are no big mountains, valleys, or bodies of water that make the map interesting. The only choke point we had it shouldn't be able to fly. I would hate if they removed this but I think it needs to go. Atvs belong on the ground. 

I like the hoverboard. Also there is no issue with balloons or glider redeploy imo.

1. Double barrel should come back changed.

The reason why it got vaulted is because it sucked. But the reason why it got nerfed is because it was too good. I think this is a perfect change for damage and balance and so the pump shotgun isn‚Äôt always the best and there can be a weapon for extreme close range.

Damage:

Epic: 132
Legendary: 138.




2. Protect the files.



Events in Fortnite. are boring because everywhere you go there‚Äôs someone leaking them from the files. Then when the event finally comes, for most people, they already know exactly whats gonna happen.


Also skins are being leaked and leakers can easily see new skins. It‚Äôs not that hard.




3. Shotgun changes.


I don‚Äôt think the pump should always be better. As I said, every shotgun should have its perks and downsides. Here‚Äôs my changes that I thought of.


New tac rarities:

Epic, Legendary.


Damage: 79 Epic
82 legendary.

Make it fire 15 pellets so it‚Äôs not overpowered, or make it so the shotgun change with pellets don‚Äôt affect it.




Heavy shotgun changes:


The heavy shotgun should be a shotgun with medium damage but high range.

Epic: 82
Legendary: 85.







Make a grey pump shotgun.

Damage: 90 





4. Creative changes.




Now these changes are for the fun of creative and to make 1v1s and games more fun with these weapons in the game. Also good because new players can use them.


Add the OG SMG in
Add the Zapatron in
Add the Guided Missle in with increased range.



Optional: Add Custom Damage for Weapons.
Optional: Shotgun cooldown changer.

&amp;#x200B;

First, lets start with the more obvious situation: It is not uncommon for several Chitauri teammates leave. In this case, you will get killed almost instantly after respawning, preventing you and all of your teammates from doing anything productive. Even worse, the stones will be guarded by more people than you have, making it almost impossible to capture any of the stones.

Not for the less obvious situation: You outnumber the Chitauri. Often, the players will compete for kills and many of them will get stolen.  This makes the game equally if not more miserable than the former situation. Even worse, if any of the stones get captured, you know it was because your teammates were neglecting them

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR by leaving as a Chitauri, you ruin the game for EVERY other player. Don't be *that* person.",FortNiteBR

I think you should be rewarded more for hitting your shots with the bow than causing splash damage, so I propose the explosive damage of the bow should be reduced to at least 50 and landing a body shot should also grant 50 with a headshot multiplier of 1.5.
On impact I also think a visual cue should be added so you know where the bow came from as the explosion makes it difficult to tell sometimes if you are not hit",FortNiteBR

For me personally, a lot of my friends were moving to Apex, and I was too at the time, Fortnite was in a bad state with the Deagle Meta, but as soon as the v7.40 patch came around it really revitalized our whole friend group to come back to Fortnite.  
Epic's plan worked, bring the top minority what they wanted to blow away the competition at the time.  
After Apex died, Fortnite went backwards, they removed Siphon from the game and it really killed what made the game fun. They added Arena, but it soon became a pain to play as you had to box up and play very passively to even gain points.   
My friends soon started to join Creative all the time and became the dreadful Playground Warriors bots fear, practicing their 90s for hours.  
The new blogpost gave me hope that they would add Siphon back, or at least the 40% increase in materials as I don't want to play Farming Simulator.  
What I'm surprised about is that people like Siphon being removed from the game, especially the casual base, wanting more of a chance in the game for a win.  
But, if you not of a higher skill, why do you think you should have a better chance against them, that's why I'm confused.  
I only play for about 2-3 hours on weekends, but playing these regular solos shows me that a lot of the bad players have come back, and I think that is what Epic wanted to happen.  
Instead of Epic helping you, shouldn't you try and get better yourself?",FortNiteBR

I'm over this cross platform lobby matchmaking. I beg to differ that it doesn't make a difference. In my opinion, it makes a huge difference. First and foremost, like I've said and tested before, nothing is stopping PC players from unplugging their controller mid loading or after it loads and use mouse and keyboard. This offers a huge unfair advantage against those using controllers on console. HUGE. Secondly, I've seen PC players using mouse and keyboard, just by their movement, editing, etc. while spectating. There are some movements that aren't even possible to do even with an elite controller as compared to M&amp;K. Third of all, PC has a monitor advantage for FPS. Some people only have a TV that hits 60FPS, while PC can hit 144+. May seem small, but it's an advantage. I used to be wonderful at fortnite. I was a dedicated player, and I've been trying to get back into it lately. I'm finding it very hard to adjust to these ""better"" PC players, and find myself in a lost battle every time due to a lower advantage. By all means, I'm not the best of the best and lost battles come and go. But, coming from my standpoint and the state the game is in now, is beyond me. The fact that we are FORCED to play cross platform and the option to turn it off has since been removed is a cheap move. We should be allowed to turn it on and off as we please, without being forced to be placed in a lobby versus PC players who may be abusing this feature in game. 

I'm not making this an exit post, as no matter how bad I may be doing in game, I'm still determined to adjust. But, Epic, seriously, you shouldn't have taken away the option to turn off cross platform.  

Just please allow us to turn off cross platform. It's not even enjoyable at this point, in my whole hearted opinion.",FortNiteBR

Now i think we can all agree to rule out infinity blade and planes since let's be honest people will just hate it again

now i know your thinking ""oh just vote for the drum gun back"" but do we really need it back i mean sure it was good but that's the point it was OP if you had one you could laser people out of existence and if you didn't have one vice versa

then the Tac SMG i don't really have any comments on this it was really just a neutral gun for me

that leaves the bouncer and grappler two items that i believe were very useful and should not have been vaulted and personally i liked the grappler better so i might vote for it

This definelty also helps players who are rotating without ballers, jumpads, rifts, etc, by giving them a little more mats.

Not everybody plays this game religiously and it's understandable from a business standpoint that epic would try and appeal to their majority player base, the casuals. The casuals need a more luck based game mode to improve their chances of doing well. The only reason streamers complain about it is because they're not as good at the game as you think and they would have to get their asses handed to them on stream sometimes.

307,ItzBaconDonutz,1556381791,bi0nuu,27,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bi0nuu/fortnite_needs_some_changes/,0,Fortnite needs some changes,"Fortnite has been going downhill for a while, but at the beginning of season 8, they started to show some good changes. No planes, rocket launchers nerfed, suppressed smgs instead of the regular ones. But later on in season 8, they added the pirate pistol and the boom bow. Naturally, the pirate pistol is going to be powerful. It has one shot and reloads take forever, and the bloom is about the same as the AR, but I feel like it never misses for some reason. It's such a consistent weapon. I think the bloom needs to be looked at, not really a major issue. Poison traps are honestly dumb. They snipe you from 2 floor tiles away, and do 80 damage. Also, siphon needs to be added again. Epic claims that 90% of players do not like siphon, however, this is clearly cherry picked, and barely anyone I know has complained about this. The main issue with siphon is the finishing issue, however, I feel like you get thirsted in the first place anyways. Bruh I really get thirsted by some kid who didn't even kill me. The boom bow is very overpowered, and should be removed. It does wayyyyy too much damage for an explosive weapon that takes less than a second to reload, and has a range similar to a sniper. Grenade launcher audio needs to be fixed, it's almost silent, and the only warning you hear is the grenade bouncing right at you and sizzles for about 1 second, very quietly. Tactical shotgun is so inconsistent. I feel like it needs to have less pellets that shoot out, because you almost never hit all of them since the spread is so wide. Epic also seems to listen to the lowest 10-20% of players instead of the pros and streamers, who can really give valuable feedback, instead of adding weapons that adhere to casual player's standards. If this game is going to have a competitive mode, and have a massive tournament, why do the only people Epic listen to suck at the game? Bush should be returned to it's original state. This rarely happens, but someone who has the bush equipped in a close range fight can deflect a shotgun shot with their bush, and no damage will be dealt. There also shouldn't be so many junk items in the game that take up healing items in chests. I feel like I shouldn't get dynamite and balloons from every chest I open. The reboot van also needs to be added back to arena. Walking through builds also needs to be fixed. If someone is inside of a build, or walked into a build that was just made, they should be teleported to right in front of the wall if they were less than 50% through the other side. I'm not talking about the tsm myth glitch thing, that could be fixed like this as well. Splash damage with explosives needs to be fixed. It shouldn't be linear. If I run away from a dynamite, and I am close to the edge of the range, I shouldn't get blasted for the full 70. Bandages and minis should be able to heal to full hp and shield. Clingers need to be replaced with regular grenades. Spamming a wall with 10 clingers isn't exactly easy to defend against. When you get rebooted, there needs to be less of a cooldown. So many times have I died to and used the cooldown of not being able to take damage to kill people. It needs to last about 1 second, enough to get behind the van or find some cover. It shouldn't allow you to pick up a shotgun off the ground and kill someone within that cooldown. Obviously it can still happen, but it's less of an issue. Most of these issues are little nitpicky things, but changing or looking at most of these issues and weapons would be a good idea.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite need guns to compete with Pump to solve the lack of good options for Close combat, more shotguns and different guns would solve this problem, like a buffed Heavy Shotgun or whatever","You can't face a Pump shotgun with other guns in close combat in almost 100% of the time because all of the fights are build battles and rush people building is really easy.

&gt; SMGs just can't compete in mid game, maybe in early game where everybody have 100 life and if the enemy miss a shot with a Pump, but in mid-end game you can't because everyone have at least 150 life. Having to hit 10 - 15 shots to kill one dude where this one dude can hit a 100 shot and build and hit one more.

&gt; Flint Knock Pistol have a 3.0 reload time, you can't use it replacing Pump, it's waaaay more consistent and easy to hit people with it compared to Pump, but having the 3.0 reload time kill the gun for close combat replacing Pump.

&gt; I don't even need to tell how weak is ARs and Snipers against Pump in close range.

&gt; Boom Bow have a tiny hit detection to use at close range point blank, at mid to close combat ok, but face to face fights you can't

Why y'all keep saying everyone wants siphon? It's clearly written 10%v90%.

90% is 9 times more than 10% if you didn't know. 

Fortnite has the worst community in history of games. Worse than cs and lol or cod.

Lots of you is so ignorant. Maybe you're not enough educated or your brain is not fully developed yet to understand how companies and life work. Companies want to make money, just like we all want so they make decisions which will benefit them the most. Epic already gave you a couple of reason why they decided not to keep siphon in but it seems like you can't read for shit. It was said that it was gonna be here for some time only. 

Some of you whine about how Epic wants to protect ""bots"". Again, if you had a brain you would understand why. You cry that it ruined the game for you. Now let me tell you how you ruined the game for casual players. We like to have fun unlike you but whenever there is something that makes it easier for other players to compete with you, you just cry about it. Deagle nerf, planes nerfed to literal shit and removed, ballers nerfed, other weapons nerfed, you even cried about aim assist on consoles. 

A lot of you in here cries that there's no reward for killing. Again proving that you don't use brains. Every BR game is about surviving. You can have 0 kills and survive. That's what gives us multiple choices. Should we get hp every time we don't kill anyone for 10 seconds? Why do you think only your playstyle should be rewarded? Reward every playstyle then. And why do you think there is only one playstyle? I know why but I'll let you figure it out. Play cod if you want deathmatch. 

Rdr2 community is also toxic but many quit playing because they didn't like it that there was no content. Just quit playing if one small feature means so much to you.

They mentioned that good players have too much mats for noobs to handle, nice so double the maximum and slow the farm rate down so that obviously little hyper kids will love their time on the game farming 3000 mats for 20 minutes straight, right? It's not the 90% child players base that likes fast paced gameplay and help/rewards for success is it?

We understand the potential impact to this weekend's tournament and are actively working on solutions. We'll keep you posted on any updates and when this is resolved.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you!",FortNiteBR

Just basically wanna say that streamers are trapped by Epic‚Äôs marketing trick. That is ‚ÄúCreator Codes‚Äù

Example: 
Streamer: Fortnite is in a bad state...go back to siphon.
  (2 seconds later)
Streamer: btw don‚Äôt forget to use my creator code‚Äù____‚Äù

TLDR: Epic knows that streamers will Sheba a hard time leaving fortnite, due to them earning money off their creator code.",FortNiteBR

As you can see, it looks like Tilted and Retail are dealing it harsh in the v8.50 update. There is a reason to this matter, Tilted and Retail are found in the files to be destroyed by the volcano https://youtu.be/SMiPCFL-VUc this is a video on what Tilted will look like after the Volcano event which is most likely to happen after the 5th rune, there will still be buildings but  mostly destroyed. The same will be happening to Retail (which means Durr and Tomatohead will most likely move to a different POI, along with the whole event stuff, Polar Peak is starting to crack, I don‚Äôt have photos of it but as the days go by the cracks will start to get larger, probably by Season 9 Polar Peak will be removed.",FortNiteBR

But look it's not backbreaking labor. Despite the long hours the devs are not working on rooftops in 100 degree heat. They're in an office building. In air conditioning. And they get paid really really well. Salaries. With benefits. 

Anyone who has worked a job where you really have to hustle and work your ass off, for much less pay, knows that the devs at Epic got it made in the shade. 

So no i don't feel for them at all. Longer hours justify what they do if they didn't have those hours then it would be a crime for someone to have a life so good. They haven't worked the kind of jobs I've had to work.

Limit everybody to 60 fps. We all know that the higher the fps,the bigger the advantage you have.

Have it so that everyone plays on the default sens and controls. God forbid someone is smart enough to change the controls to their liking to give them an advantage. 

Limit players on the time per day. This would stop players from getting better and it would make it even for the casuals. I am very fond of this one because I play less than an hour a day and put no effort into getting better, but I have being killed by people better than me.

Epic- ok here is an essay with data we used to back up why it was unhealthy for pubs. Stating 90% of players were playing less and were growing frustrated while 10% were dominating more

This sub-‚Äúthat‚Äôs nice epic, but what is we added siphon back to pubs anyway? You are ruining the game‚Äù

Like wtf guys. Move on. You are not helping the game by asking for something back that epic knows is bad for 90% of the player base. This is not up for debate anymore. Epic tested it, gathered results, and knows what was better for the game. Changing it back would kill the game way faster. But feel free to quit if you think the game is ‚Äúliterally unplayable‚Äù or a ‚Äúfarming simulator‚Äù. I have no sympathy for your entitled whining and exaggerating. Or for skilled players that want to ruin the experience for casual players by making pubs overly competitive again instead of playing arena. Ask for arena changes instead. Hopefully squads/clans come to arena next. That‚Äôd be awesome",FortNiteBR

And for those of us who play it regularly we've become very fond and attached to using it. As it's one of the better pickaxes in the game. 

So what does Epic do? They release the pickaxe for the founders who bought the other mode. What do they also do? They make it exclusively part of the Rose Team set and make it *pink*. 

This is honestly a slap in the face. And it was a conscious decision on Epics part. Would it have been so hard to release the pickaxe with editable styles? No it wouldn't have. It would have been *easy*. 

So now we're given an awesome *iconic* pickaxe from the other mode with no option to customize it the color that we prefer. The most basic thing we could have asked for. 

Seriously it's beyond frustrating. Just another thing nobody asked for.",FortNiteBR

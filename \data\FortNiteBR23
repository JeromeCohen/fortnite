One dumbass thing that's still in the game that annoys the everliving shit out of me is the close range rocket launcher plays. Like how is this still in the game after 9 bloody seasons?

Primarily, the lists of guidelines and restrictions have become long and obscure. I've seen several occasions where threads have been locked or deleted and a moderator simply posts a long list of one category of guidelines, providing no insight into which of the 15 bullet points was the reason the thread was locked. In addition, I observed an OP inquiring in a comment to a moderator about why his post was removed and they simply responded with ""Check the promotional guidelines"" when it was not apparent at all even when reading those guidelines. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Just to be clear - none of these instances are related to any of my posts**. A lot of moderation work is done automatically by bots, so it would be helpful if the human moderators could act more human. My feedback is that moderators should be providing more context when explaining their enforcement of guidelines, rather than just throwing a list out. Some guidelines can be interpreted differently and it is not always clear how the guidelines relate to a locked or deleted post.",FortNiteBR

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE stop dropping from the squad, and for the love of God stop dropping on named locations that are super popular, (tilted, pleasant, mega, etc.)

I'm sure some of you are very capable of hot dropping and dominating, but the majority of you are NOT capable of doing so. I'm tired of hearing you scream for a revive and listening to your mother tell you to calm down. You then repeat this proccess two more times, call us stupid, and leave. 

If you want to succeed in ANY game mode and you are not a highly skilled player, or happen to be very passive, DO NOT HOT DROP. Stay with your squad, drop outskirts or low pop areas and loot. You have a better chance if you just stay calm and relax. Not every living soul needs to be engaged, this includes people 100+ meters away and all you have is a tactical rifle.

Also, STOP FUCKING SPAMMING THE PING SYSTEM. I get it, there's a legendary hand Canon, but after the first 10 pings and none of us have come to get it, the message should be obvious. However, DO spam ping system on enemy players so we know where they are. Same goes for when you're down. If you're stuck in a structure that's multiple stories, I have no fucking idea where the enemy is.

Rather than incoherently screaming like a Neanderthal, ping over and over where the enemy is so I have an idea of how to handle the situation. It betters your odds of a revive, saves me the annoyance of dying to someone sitting behind a counter in the same room as you, and teaches you to be a better team player.

If none of this means anything to you, or you feel the need to continue doing these actions, please quit team based modes and go play solo.",FortNiteBR

Currently, the LTM rewards people who avoid fights until the end. Someone could have 20+ kills and be #1, but that places a huge target on their head and a team with full shield and 3 lives can just repeatedly push them (right as they're about to win) and steal all of their points.   


I think these changes would make this mode a lot better:  
\- Add a longer respawning delay

\- Make it so when you kill someone in the top 3, you get a larger number of points but you don't steal every single point they have, otherwise we're just playing hot potato

\- Add siphon, or have players drop minis and other items. Unless you kill someone on their final life, you don't get any loot (except for the normal Team Rumble bonus mats and ammo). If you're #1 you already have people respawning and landing on you until you die, but you also have no shield to defend yourself.   


Just some ideas.",FortNiteBR

I didn’t stick around most of season 4 but came back at the end of the season and have been playing since. I am a proficient player. I have about 400-500 wins. 3.0kda. I have around 300-350 arena points and can hang with the players in that point zone. 

Prior to PC gaming the past few years of my life I was a high level competitive Halo player. I placed very well competitively in MLG leagues back in the day. I really miss that controller life. I love playing KBM but I feel like my real skill lies dormant on controller. 

I wanted to see if there were any players here who have made the transition at a higher skill level like myself (again I’m not the best but I’m proficient). Was it worth it? How did you make the switch? Did you switch to PS4 or Xbox controller. I know the transition will be uncomfortable at first, but how long does it take to get the feels back? 

I have a top of the line PC setup. I think I can have an easy transition hardware wise. Just wondering if it’s worth me switching this late in my career or if I should just ride out the PC.

Recent news revealed that Scarlett Johnasson is going to be directing a stand-a-lone Black Widow movie, seperate from the Avengers scene, and likely before the events of Endgame.

Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is also on its way, and despite the James Gunn controversy has been moving along steadily.

I don’t believe Marvel allowed Epic Games to use these skins alone due to their weapon sets matching the same ones found in Fortnite, I believe it’s simply because they were cheaper to use, can be resold in the future and are decent promotional material for future movies or shows about the characters.

Marvel likes doing fun events like Avengers LTM’s and more, because it’s beneficial to both parties. Now, with cheaper projects (than Endgame) like a Black Widow stand-a-lone movie and Guardians of the Galaxy 3, they can simply just allow or ask Epic Games to rerelease the skins as a cheaper advertisement.",FortNiteBR

-It has no sound. So, if I get hit with it or if a shot comes anywhere close to me I have no idea where it came from. Especially when third partying comes into play it's extremely easy for someone to spam it without getting noticed. Whereas the snipers can either be heard (.50 cal and hunting rifle) or the silenced can be figured out, by that I mean you can tell where the fire is coming from based on where the bullets are hitting. This becomes an issue in late game where someone can just hide behind a tree, bush, top of a mountain, etc. and easily half someones health or kill them. 

-It takes no skill. I don't understand how hunting rifles and the silenced sniper do less damage than this gun when it is so easy to use. I could see makes if there wasn't any splash damage or if it had reduced accuracy but if someone's standing next to their wall I can just shoot it next to there feet and do over a 100 damage. 

-There should be a cap on ammo for it. It is extremely annoying to have someone spam 100 shots with the boombow. Whereas spamming other weapons I just need to build in the direction the gunfire is coming from. With this thing I need to make sure that none of my body is going to get hit from the side or above of my builds which is gonna burn matts. Snipers are one thing where you can at least get a shot on them when they're peeking but the bow you can literally bunny hop on your build and hip fire the damn thing. 

-The damage. There's absolutely no reason this weapon should do as much damage as it does. As it stands it does the same as a rocket launcher. Yes, the rocket launcher has a larger AOE but there's a cap at 13 shots with it. You can also hear a rocket coming from a mile away and can build in front of it's path. I could see this gun doing 50 damage, but honestly that's about it. When it comes to end game not everyone is lucky to get a bunch of shield to recover from it's damage, either you've been fighting the whole game and there hasn't been much health/shield pickup off kills or you've had plain old bad RNG. Also, if someone hits me for over a hundred with a sniper or 90 with a hunting rifle, at the very least I know it took them some sort of skill to hit me. Hitting a moving target with a sniper and taging them for a lot is one thing. Seeing someone running along and aiming for their feet is completely different. 

-Damage through builds. I've heard of people having an issue with people using the double heavy sniper for knocking people through walls. You can do literally the same thing if someone else has a heavy sniper or you can do it with a rocket, shooting the bow right when the rocket hits a build. Or, if someone is waterfalling of a build you can just tag there floors and smack them. 

-The accuracy. This one's pretty self explanatory. 

At the end of the day I don't use the bow because I feel like a POS using it. It seems unfair to the rest of the players and it's really not that fun to use when there's no skill in using it. I could see it retaining it's current stats if it only dropped out of vending machines or supply drops. If it doesn't then it needs to be seriously nerfed. I mean it's extremely easy to use this thing even if there gliding and are over a 100m away. I might be in the minority here but that's just my two cents, I personally just want it gone. 

It's pretty late here and I definitely didn't proof read this so I apologize beforehand if I sound confusing at any point during this rant.",FortNiteBR

It's gave risk for reward. So if someone spammed or phased into your box it came with the risk of if your opponent can hit their shots. You could spam or even fire back your pump. So many times I was able to outplay/outskill players (keep in mind this is a basic function of skill) who were worse than me who decided to spam. I think the real way to solve the problem with casuals, is they expect to win more than they should. Regardless of what you do people who are worse at the game will always be worse. Don't forget worse players still had the ability to hit that pump shot while another player forced into their box. This created a balance allowing for players of all skill levels to succeed due to skill and game sense. Of course we don't want pubs to be so competitive but we still want it to be skill based and not bloom based. Most fights regardless will end or be mainly damage with a shotgun due to the nature of shotguns. This meta would be so balanced with the current patch and the pump. I personally don't like what the drum does to the general gameplay and makes it a lot more repetitive. Even the worse skilled players are tired of it and when they are in creative (idk if you guys can access this data) majority use/put a pump in the map they are playing on. If one the devs or community managers  could comment with what you guys think about this.

For starters; the skin isn’t even the same model, and the only similarities are the obvious ones like the suit and head of hair- other than that it’s a totally new and original skin. The “Reaper” skin was a nod to the John Wick series, and was not a fully copyrighted or official skin for Keanu Reeve’s character in the movie. It was a cartoony parody of the franchise, and was not intended as an official “John Wick” skin.

We shouldn’t let our precious “OG” status or ego get in the way of appreciating new amazing content like this, and it astounds me that so many people are this insecure about a cosmetic in a free video game. The game has enough problems as is, and adding this sorta drama into the mix helps nothing improve. Realize that once the servers shut down and you’ve moved on, you getting upset about your “OG status” will mean nothing.

I think this was a missed opportunity for the skin to be reactive. 

Here’s my idea on how he can be reactive:

Whenever John Wick is at 60 HP or below, his skin will appear as the “damaged” variant, since 60 HP is considered “low” in terms of health. And whenever he is above 60 HP, he appears as “undamaged”.

I really thought this was a missed opportunity as soon as it came out in the store, because it would really fit for him to appear as damaged, since it has all the bullets and holes in his suit, which would make sense coming out of a fight.

...BUT it needs some pretty major reworking

First off, not the biggest issue, but no incentive for being aggressive early game, which is fine, but the rules make it so anti-aggressive you could just find some shield, farm, and then camp until it’s a 1v1. 

Secondly, having 3 lives is interesting but 1v4’ing a whole squad 3 times can be almost impossible. Add siphon. Maybe not as much as +50 materials/health but something at least. You end up battling a team 3 times because they get mad and keep attacking and by the end of it you have no shield or mats and the storms already hitting you. Or maybe just make it solo/duo as an option.

Lastly and probably most important. THE GODDAMN MUSIC IS SO FRICKIN LOUD. It makes the game almost unplayable especially by late game when hearing is crucial. Even with visual audio turned on I got W-key’d with a tommy gun over and over and just had no clue where from. 

Don’t really expect Epic to do anything about this mode. It’s just an LTM for the John Wick movie coming out so it’s probably the only time we’ll be playing it. Not to mention Epic is one of the least community driven gaming company’s out there. So I guess this is just me blowing off steam... 🤷🏼‍♂️",FortNiteBR

I will likely buy this new one, but I wish there was just some special version of the new one, even if you still had to buy it, to commemorate the people who have been here for a while. This is like the Skull Trooper, they didn’t want their truly OG skin to be ruined in the item shop through everyone having it. Though this is different, it still ruins the skin for everyone’s go owned it originally. Just show some pity, imagine if your rarest favorite skin, got a much cooler looking duplicate put into the item shop, and you got nothing but your uglier skin to show this. 

In conclusion, we just don’t want our cool, rare, somewhat OG skin to be ruined by the superior item shop John Wick, all we want is some sort of recognition other than just our inferior skins.",FortNiteBR

385,GetOffMyBus,1558025479,bpeyjr,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bpeyjr/strategy_for_john_wick_ltm/,63,Strategy for John Wick LTM,"This won’t work for everyone, but someone may find this helpful. I was able to get 450 coins 3-4 games in a row, and also clutch a win with a dead squad using this.

#Strategy: 

1. Land far from the bus’ path, find an AR, get full shields, then carry stacks of slurps+minis or big pots+minis. Get at least 500, ideally 1000 mats (pain in the ass, just go mostly for trees). So your ideal load out would be 3 guns, and 2 full stacks of shield items, and 1000 mats. *You’re going to want to shield up on each respawn*.

2. You don’t want to waste your 3 lives taking on senseless fights that will give you 4 coins. You also don’t want to draw mindless W-keyer’s attention towards you by being on the leaderboard/map until as late as possible. Wait until #1 team has around 250-300 coins.

3. Keeping a decent distance between your team and the leading teams is also ideal. Have one squad member carry 1-2 rifts rifts/jump pads to close the distance whenever you’re ready to push. 

4. If your squad fails to wipe them out, hopefully everyone still has 2 lives left. Regroup, shield up, and push again. Repeat this step if you die.

5. If you’re able to wipe out the leading squad, you should have around 250-350 coins at this point. Now it’s time to take out the weaker links (team 2 or 3), who will hopefully have around 100-200 coins and get you the win.

Step 5 is the hardest part imo, considering you might already be low on lives/shields. Also, if they kill you, they might get the 500 coins. Essentially, you can win the game by only taking out 2 squads.


#Tips for combat:

1. Weaken the team you’re fighting with your AR (AK/infantry is best imo but blue AR is also good) and push for close/mid range when you break shields. If you seem someone separated from their group, try and end them quickly before their team can come help. Remember that the combat shotgun has a considerably long range and shoots annoyingly fast, use it.

2. Keep an eye on the map if you’re unable to spot their exact locations. Many leading teams will turtle on the ground after each fight to collect their senses and heal up.

3. Not every fight is worth it, don’t engage a fight just because they seem too close for comfort. Just make sure you have enough mats to protect yourself from them pushing. All it takes is one cheeky shot for them to ruin your HP.

4. RPGs are cool. Ammo boxes puke out rockets, if you find an RPG, substitute it for your AR and use your SMG for long range shots.

5. It’s just like any other squad fight, try not to panic (yeah yeah, easier said than done), just because they have 300 points doesn’t mean they’re insanely talented players. Believe in yourself, even if you fail, you can queue up for another.

This isn’t a guaranteed win, obviously, but I had a pretty fun time playing my games with this strategy in mind. Has a much higher chance of winning, opposed to just simply trying to mow over everyone we ran across.

This is more of a challenge with randoms, many of them just want to frag out, but you could try getting them onboard. Play with friends if you can, explain your strategy to them, if they're willing to give it a shot. 

Hope this helps!",FortNiteBR

Okay, so people were complaining how the game caters to noobs and most of the community wants accurate, unspammable guns. Then the drum gun gets voted in by a landslide. To be fair most of the voters could have been noobs but then epic is catering to the noobs because there are tons of them. Then people complain that pubs are too sweaty, but they are the ones saying that epic shouldn’t cater to noobs, so no wonder most noobs left the game. Then a new shotgun that rewards accuracy comes out and people complain because it is “too hard to hit shots with”. Exactly.  It rewards players with good aim which is what you want. you don’t like when noobs get lucky or easy kills but expect to get them yourself?

Why do I do this? Curiosity, simple as that.


Now, personally I believe the pump should indeed return, but not yet, hear me out.
The big problem with the pump is that it made about 20% (or around that was stated by epic) of eliminations each match, if you consider there are more than 15 different weapons to use then having 20% is a big deal. Having that in consideration I do believe epic did right on vaulting it, if they plan to bring it back that is, because now I noticed that people's loadouts are variating and it's no longer just AR/pump/SMG so having some variation brings new play styles to the table which I see as an absolute win, it was getting a little bit annoying that every single battle was the same, building and pump.


But that doesn't mean the pump was gamebreaking, but it has been the most reliable weapon since the days of the double pump, therefore vaulting it can also hurt the game since the player base feels comfortable using it, not being able to use the pump can be frustrating for some people, thats why I believe it should be unvaulted.


Why do I believe they should bring it back later and not now? Because that way it could be enough time for people to try other play styles and after that, they can decide weather they want the pump in their loadout or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped playing fortnite back in december of last year. I recently started playing it again but when I logged into my xbox and booted up fortnite ALL MY SKINS, STATS, VBUCKS, SAVE THE WORLD ETC is gone. Completely gone. I reached out to EPIC and they had me provide them with a list of all my purchases with invoice IDs, my IP address, where my account was created/purchases made etc etc. These are the steps I was todl to follow, which I can;t seem to figure out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a step by step guide on how you can retrieve your login details. 

 1. Go to [https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/buy-now/battle-royale)

 2. Click the silhouette in the top right corner (Sign out if you're already signed in to an account)

 3. You should get a pop-up window that says ""Do you already play Fortnite?"" - click on ""yes""

 4. After that, click on the Microsoft button - you will then be asked to sign in using your Xbox live credentials.

 5. When prompted, register with Epic by adding a new email address (not in use on any Epic account) and display name to your Epic account.

&amp;#x200B;

 You may disconnect your console account from the account with no data.

&amp;#x200B;

 Once your email is verified, you can disconnect your console account from the Epic account you registered. Then, you can connect your console account to the Epic account that has your data. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can do everything 1-4 and click that I played on xbox and the microsoft window pops up for a half second and it auto-logs me into my account on the fortnite (EPIC) website. After this I DO NOT SEE anywhere where a ""prompt"" to register and add a new email account is...I've tried what feels like 1000 times. I guess I'm having issues with the ""nameless account problem"" and I can't figure out hwo to resolve this issue. When I log into XBOX fortnite i have no progression / skins / vbucks....but I logged into my roommates PC fortnite with my xbox credentials and what do you know...all my stuff seems to have been linked to a PC account? I never played on PC, only xbox. Does anyone know how to resolve this? Customer support is taking a while to respond. 

&amp;#x200B;

I’m for changing the game up as well because I think that keeps things interesting. I’m unsure about the current meta. 

In my opinion, the game has become even more of just a shotgun game. I can’t remember the last time we had a mid range battle where people didn’t just charge immediately after the first shot. I’m okay with vaulting the pump even, but I do think the new combat needs some tweaks for damage drop off. You can hit someone from a great distance and still hit 70-80 off them. 

My last thought on everything is that there’s way too much mobility. I loved the bounce pads and they were removed because there was too much mobility. Now we have a slip stream that covers the whole map, rift to go, volcano vents, shadow bombs, etc.  I just feel like this leads to so many people third, fourth, fifth partying and running straight up for another shotgun fight.

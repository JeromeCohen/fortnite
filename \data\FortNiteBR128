I get on fortnite and get pushed by planes all night. Now my complaint isn’t about planes in general just about the availability of planes early game. We then decide after multiple drops that immediately had planes that we were only gonna drop tilted for the night since there aren’t usually planes early game. I drop on fish and knock 2 people, then a plane runs through with a boom box and knocks down the building... I recover, but immediately get pushed by the team who crashed into the building in a plane and somehow took no damage from it.

Of the two that pushed, 1 more got knocked by me... last guy kills me and eliminates.  This is all in the span of about 20 seconds from landing (maybe a minute)


Now here are my proposals:

1) make planes spawn later in the match so they can still be used the way they are, but only once people have a chance to get the guns that can counter it.

2) take out their guns so they are a rotational tool, and can even be used to break builds... but not as easily as they do now

3) make a competitive mode like every other big name game has and try and make some semblance of balance


I can appreciate that a lot of people will hate on me because they think I’m a sweat.. I promise I’m not, I have around a 1.6 k/d and regularly get outbuilt.  I just want semi balanced gameplay",FortNiteBR

https://i.redd.it/8f93ibr0kj721.png

Ever since mid/late season 5, blue (rare) item shop skins started receiving back blings. I think it'd be cool if there was just one big update where all of the old blue skins receive back blings. They don't have to be anything crazy. For example, the triple back bling pack contains 3 green (uncommon) back blings, and they're all very simple, one of them is literally just a backpack. I think the blue skins should receive simple back blings like that.

As for the purple (epic) and gold (legendary) skins, there is no reason for them not to have back blings. Why are there blue skins that you can buy for 1,200 vbucks, but flytrap, a skin that costs 2,000 vbucks has no back bling? I can sort of understand why Epic wouldn't want to add back blings to every blue skin, but at least add it for the purple and gold ones.

Season Shop, Battle Pass, and bundle exclusive skins don't need to receive a back bling. (Although it would be nice if Eon got one)

And if any Epic employee is reading this: Just because you add a back bling to holiday skins like Ghoul Trooper or Codename Elf, it doesnt mean you have to re-release it. Just add the back bling and re-release it whenever you want. There was no reason to wait a whole year to add back blings to Crackshot and the Gingerbread set. They could've been added in July or something, and then re-released in December.",FortNiteBR

Hear me out community.,"989 solo matches, 150 solo wins on PS4 (my current console.) Another +100 or so solo wins on Xbox. Since day one release. 

I’m a casual. I play with default sensitivity, 1.5x building sensitivity, it’s just what works for me personally. I don’t have a scuf controller, I use the F.P.S pack, my aim isn’t the best but I make due thanks to low sensitivity. 

So let me explain.

The boom box gives players like myself a chance to keep up with players using higher sensitivity, to bring them back to square one and challenge them when they least expect it. 

We have to stop as a community having a knee jerk reaction to new features and items when they are added. Sure, planes are annoying and maybe the boom box is seems like a cheap move, but so is the grapple gun and it’s been in game way longer. 

I’ve been using it and it’s been fun, the game overall is fun but can always improve.

Planes on their current state are completely broken and the boomboxes only add to this insanity. No one should have to play through planes flying through their builds as a boom box completely destroys their structure and they are put in a moshpit of multiple players with each praying that their shotgun doesn’t hit for 20.

However, that being said, the community response to all of these changes I believe are unacceptable. I remember back during season 3 and before where there was no method of movement outside of simply running. If you wanted to run somewhere, that’s what you did. There were no planes, no rifts. When shopping carts were introduced, it made huge waves in the community and I welcomed this change. This was the first of many different methods of transports now available. But before these changes, the gameplay and overall feel of the game was much slower then season 7 and if you were to show someone from that time what the game was like now they would not believe it. Back then it was common to just die in the storm because you couldn’t outrun it. Now unless you’re in the final circles it’s very uncommon unless you have no idea what you are doing or are fighting someone outside of the zone. These vehicles changed that, and with unlucky RNG in the beginning, it made many locations such as snobby, lonely, and lucky much more viable drops, especially for less experienced players.

But, in the current state of the game, I don’t understand why everyone is throwing such a huge fit. Epic has made changes to the game against the higher skilled players since season 4 when they nerfed shotguns to the ground. Only this outcry matches in my eyes how much complaining Epic is receiving towards planes and boomboxes. However in most matches currently I feel like much of the game is decided by mainly RNG. With the skill cap getting higher and higher literally by the week, it’s impossible for anyone but someone who is entirely devoted to the game to keep up. And it’s not that these changes helped but once the game has reached a certain point, there are many players that try very hard to win games and have such a high level of skill that with the current handicaps in place, even if you are able to outbuild someone or box them in, there are alternatives to killing the very skilled player. The game isn’t about who is the best anyone, but I think the new additions actually change that.

Specifically with boomboxes, I think that they add a new skill tree to the game’s already extensive different play styles. If you have very good aim but can’t build, you don’t have to build now. And the game isn’t about who can use the most mats in 1 seconds. Instead of worry about who can do 10 tris in a second and get an RSI, they can improve at their aim and not be so oriented on building that they increase their sens to where there’s no point in worrying about your aim. 90% of the times, most players in the competitive scene build are around the same speeds and it’s more up to the luck of the draw and conditions than anything. With the same conditions as we see in playground and creative, most build fights just go to heaven and are who can peek the hardest. Boomboxes literally do the same thing except bring it down to ground level. They just make the game more aim oriented. Fortnite was never meant to be about doing sextuple ramp rushes and edit peeking. In fact, I would say it’s more fun just to leave it up to aim then to make it have the person trying to edit a wall and aim faster then someone can react to your modification. In the current state where you just walk yourself in and move around is literally my least favorite meta out of maybe any in the game. With boomboxes, it helps test how wee you can aim and helps make the game less about how fast you can outbuild someone.

Planes are in a similar position, I’m tired of Ninja threatening to quit Fortnite over planes not being removed. It’s a part of the game that was always intended. And I would be willing to bet multiple developers worked countless hours on planes only to have the entire community throw a temper tantrum because they can fly through builds. You don’t need to build to heaven. RPGs existed before planes and when the buffed explosives no one seemed to care. I can understand planes can do more damage quicker but at what point is it too much. At least with planes you are prone and you take a hefty amount of damage when planes are destroyed. There are already many glaring weaknesses in planes. You are prone so if someone is a skilled sniper or rifle user you can get pretty tagged up even in only a few seconds. Tfue can pretty much kill someone in a plane if the person is moving towards him or along him for more than 5 seconds. And anyone can just shoot the plane. There should be more strategy in Fortnite then just building to heaven. 99% of esports have insane amounts of strategy and you don’t just go in and try to gun everyone down. I also play counterstrike at a pretty high level (Supreme) and at the point at least for me, you don’t just run it. You know how to pop flash, a pretty good amount of smokes, different strategies. Even how to strafe, something I think is going to start coming and is already beginning to be utilized in Fortnite. The game should take more strategy than just building and planes are a viable option considering how many weaknesses they already have.

Finally, I feel that either way, the community should stop throwing a massive fit towards Epic. They have done more for their fan base than any development team I think I have ever seen in a game. When you look at projects like Yandere Simulator where the lead developer tells fans of the game to shut up and leave the community for literally trying to offer help with the coding it shows how a dedicated and open development team is to the success of the game. It’s arguably what’s took this game so far. I was once in most of the people’s position when they destroyed shotguns. After the removed double pump I quit the game only to return in season 7 when I heard about planes. Ever since then it has been my favorite season yet except for one thing. The players. The community has gone downhill A LOT. There are so many players trying to be the next Ninja and be the best player but there are already only so many slots for that position. Most of those slots are already filled. Of course a few people will always continue to break through this barrier but with all the toxicity and competitiveness of the current games it can be annoying to say the least. There are already so many players at a very high skill lever where it gets to the point that it’s basically RNG if you win or if you lose. Did you have high ground to begin with, did you have fail health, did you use most of your mats the previous build fight. There are all issues and in the end people try so hard but none of this will probably even matter in the end. I understand this is the Fortnite Competitive sub so everyone here probably takes this game seriously but I’m hoping you all are honest enough with yourselves to know that you probably won’t blow up and become a huge streamer. But that’s ok. I trust Epic more than any other developer right now with the game. Activision and EA are making fools of themselves taking money from people who just want to play their games. Epic made their’s free (kind of). Bethesda just doesn’t care and Blizzard is subtly telling their fan base to shut up only for them to become more enraged (The Diablo mess). But I just want everyone to settle down a little. Just enjoy the game, if you did it isn’t the end of the world you can just hit the start match button again. If you still don’t like the game that’s fine but please stop harassing Epic over this and know that this game is in the best hands it can be in right now and the game is still being changed weekly.

Beyond that I feel like I covered everything I had to say but I just wanted to get my thoughts and feeling out there even if no one really finds this or cares in the end. Just enjoy the game and I hope all of you end up doing well competitively in the future. See you in scrims, 
- Obama Gaming 47

TLDR: I don’t see boom boxes as a bad addition, it just makes people focus less on building and more on aim. Planes aren’t a bad addition, in fact they help you travel the map in a way post people wouldn’t have even dreamed of in seasons 3 and before. Their damage output is a bit overpower but planes also have glaring weakness that make them very risky to use. Either way the game is in good hands with Epic and with all the other recent game developer controversies all I have to say is we’re lucky we have them. Just don’t bash them over their plan for the game because they have done so much for us so we should see what ideas they have.

And it’s a continuous cycle. It goes:

Horrible item added —&gt; community REE’s —&gt; epic vaults the items and says they’ve should’ve communicated better.

Some instances of this are:

• explosive damage through walls

• infinity blade

• planes (not yet fixed)

• turrets 

• pre nerfed P90

• drum gun

• c4


NOT TO MENTION PARAGON

Who even makes these childish ideas at epic? And why would they even think of them? 

Epic this has got to stop. Or else people will stop playing you’re game. Simple as that

Sorry for the rant, I just wanted to get this off my chest. Time to grind BO4 until this boom box and planes get nerfed/removed

Epic keeps adding unnecessary items that ruin the game, and they haven’t learned from their mistakes

It truly amazes me how moronic the imbeciles working on this game are. I don't understand how every one in the community can feel a certain way and they do the exact opposite of what we want. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many worthless items in the game. I don't understand how I can search 10 chests at the beginning of a game and find nothing but fucking boogie bombs, grenades, dynamite, boom boxes, stink bombs, the bush (who not a single person has used since season 5), gray bursts, and gray subs. You'll bet your ass I can search an entire building in Tilted Towers and not find an ounce of shield or a single shotgun. Don't worry though, because some dumbass with 100 health 100 shield will run over and pump me for 220 with his gold spas. And just incase it's the single game where I happen to find shield, he'll have a gold P90 to swap to after. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know you're thinking, someone doesn't find that good of loot and come kill me every game, and you're right. The other times we'll have kids from 4 other buildings throwing endless amounts of dynamite, grenades and boom boxes to tear the building I'm in down before I can fucking blink. The best part is that since we're 1 minute into the game, I don't have any materials. I'll float to the bottom of where my building used to be, take 50 fall damage, and stand there with my 10 grenades and single gray submachine gun in hand, ready to get absolutely deleted by 4 cocksuckers looking all at me with their scars, AKs, and desert eagles. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, you are absolutely sure I'm being overly dramatic, and I might be. Sometimes, I do make it out of wherever I land that game. The only thing better than surviving my drop location is leaving to be greeted by six planes, spraying every single build down, only to be followed up by RAMMING my asshole with the plane into the next dimension. \*(PLEASE NOTE: 10/10 kids killing me from planes are a better player than I)

&amp;#x200B;

AND YET STILL, WE PERSEVERE. I have conquered the assholes with shotguns and shield using only my gray burst. I have gathered enough mats to squeeze away with 10 health after my building is demolished. I have survived the onslaught of 9/11. What's next you ask? Well after all of this adversity, I've survived to make it to end game. The only thing I don't have? Materials. I've had to use all of mine to survive and not a single person had more than 100 wood and 40 brick. Now I have to farm from 50 people left down to 13, because I can break 50 trees and get as much wood. 

&amp;#x200B;

We've made it to endgame, and it's a damn miracle. Now our last obstacle? A whole team planted on top of the tallest mountain in the game. They have 4 1x1's made of steel, all have snipers, deagles, and rocket launchers. At this point, I'm ready to put my controller in a garbage disposal and go jump into a trash compactor. I can't believe all the bullshit you have to go through to win a single game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I've told you a story. The moral of said story? There is so much worthless shit you have to go through, survive, and endure just to get a single win. The sad thing? I still want to play the game because it CAN be fun. Remove all the garbage items. Make building actually possible and embrace it as a core mechanic, because it is. Reward players for getting kills. You've been testing it for how many months? This game really has the potential to be THAT good for every type of player, but they keep trying to nerf the stuff the majority of the community wants, while adding things that only piss off and push away the community leaders. (i.e. Ninja, Tfue, Nickmercs, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

 hes slow as hell, he keeps playing the game with  music blasting down his mic, thus half the fcking time he doesnt know where enemies are coming from in CQB situations, its annoying as hell how bad he is.

He aim is legit trash, and aim assits legit does all the work for him.

He never/rarely builds, only time i see him building is just to go up a hill or build a mini 1x1 in zone, he never has reflexes to build in teamfights, so he gets fkced 80% of all fights on PC servers..

i already told him multiple times to turn off his music and maybe to actually concentrate on the in game audio, but he says he doesnt want to and that music ''doesnt disctract me''  BS....

Idk, he never wants to practice in playground mode either to get better at build fights.

Its annoying that people who have put a lot of time into understanding the mechanics of this game are better than me! Even though this game separates itself from other BRs due to one sole mechanic - BUILDING - I don't like building all that much and i'm not very good at it. Why do i play this game then? obviously for the awesome cosmetics! But yah I don't want to put in EFFORT and TIME into improving my building to become better at the game - i wanna be good immediately! Shooting down builds from the ground usually ends up in me getting lazered but with this new boom boi I can just throw one down and watch as the cowardly builders fall! ItS a DrEaM cOme TrUe!!

Why....just why are we adding this into the game? Why do we need more things to destroy materials. Is dynamite, the rocket launcher, the grenade launcher, and the quad launcher not good enough? Is the plane that people keep using has a wrecking ball to just third party kamikaze into build fights not good enough? Why is it that you guys are so quick to add the most idiotic items like the plane to the game yet adding in the pop up cup changes to the regular modes isn’t something that has happened yet? Fine if you guys aren’t so sure about getting health back from kills being a good idea (I think it’s amazing) but getting materials from kills is a no brainer. People have gotten good at this game so build fights can get pretty crazy and you will sometimes need a lot of material to kill a good player. On top of that explosives and now the boom box can eat through your materials fast. What’s there to think about? Fix your game. Take care of the items that aren’t balanced. Nerf the planes and stop them from being wrecking balls, change explosives as they are too strong right now and require no skill to use, and for the love of all that is good in the world FIX YOUR BUGS. Zip lines need fixing, my gun still shoots by itself when I switch between traps and builds too fast, (and that’s been going on for like two months now) my shotgun doesn’t shoot even though I pulled the trigger, my building pieces don’t come out even though I pressed the button for the build piece to get placed....like there’s so much to fix yet here we are with more and more dumb shit being added to the game. What’s worse is that the bugs I mentioned all can cost you a game yet they aren’t fixed and you just add more overpowered items into the game instead of fixing these bugs first so we have more to worry about. Hope you guys are gonna start the new year off right and tell us about a ranked mode or about working more on fixing bugs or making balance changes. Let’s have some more common sense on items you guys add to the game that clearly don’t belong and are broken. Its very concerning that you guys have a problem with bouncers being in the game but yet added the sword and didn’t see anything wrong with it right away. ",FortNiteBR

154,Royal-Derpness,1546204043,aaztkb,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aaztkb/ltm_idea_encumbered/,1,LTM Idea: Encumbered,"So you know those game mechanics, usually in RPGs, where if you’re carrying too much stuff in your inventory, your movement speed is slowed?

This is the basic concept. For example, if you are ONLY carrying your pickaxe, your movement speed would be 200% (double) the default movement speed. Every inventory slot taken up after that, would reduce your movement speed by x%. 

Example:
One item: 175%
Two items: 150%
Three items: 125%
Four items: 100% (normal movement speed)
Five items: 75%

(I’d highly recommend changing these numbers, just an example.)

Similarly, I suppose to maintain consistency, your jump height would also have to be reduced. 

This gives the player the choice whether or not they should drop more items, to gain more movement speed, or carry more items in exchange for being a lot slower. 

The storm could also be faster and more damaging, to make the decision of dropping items more challenging. (“Do I drop this to outrun the storm to take a lot less damage, or keep it, in exchange for taking a lot more damage?”)

I would also recommend stuff like grapplers and balloons maybe removed for this LTM, as the whole idea of this mode is movement speed and mobility, so balloons and grapplers may have either be removed, or their efficiency scaled down in proportion to the number of inventory slots taken up. 

Sorry for the long read, just thought this could be an interesting LTM. 

TLDR; more items you carry, the slower you are. The less items you carry, the faster you are. Faster and more deadly storm. ",FortNiteBR

1) the boom box comes in stacks of one it’s not like you get 6 of them or something crazy and they are epic variety so right now there is a lot of them but the drop rate will reduce.

2) it’s an equalizer. It doesn’t just affect the opponents builds it effects yours as well.

3) it also levels the playing field a little bit in the building department and in the turtle game department. When you get out built you really have 3 options 1) build up for positioning.  2) lure them back to the ground game/turtle 3) knock them down so you can reset. This brings in a 4th option turn it into a gunfight no builds just Mano e Mano fight it out in no mans land. I want to also mention that there have been plenty of complaints to the crazy building the sweats (they even put a game mode recently where in the description it stated use natural cover) so there is a community desire for it.

4) it’s hilarious, look at Fortnite what it was this zany cartoon character runnin around killin each other they shoot pumpkins from rocket launchers and snowballs that yell wheeee! It’s just a fun item that adds a new angle to a game that is slowly becoming strictly competitive in regular game play. 

5) it’s a new addition improvise, adapt, overcome, don’t complain needlessly.

Now I’m not just mindlessly for the new item it does have some flaws that I do recognize

1) the time it stays active forever I believe it is 5 seconds we would be fine with 3.5 

2) it destroys non player built structures I would like to hopefully see an adjustment to the way it destroys buildings I have some concepts that I can detail if people are interested.

3) you should be able to destroy it. If I see it on the ground I should be able to put a couple of shots on it to cancel it if I so choose.


Thank you for reading this far would love to hear your thoughts

The subreddit especially has become hard for me to deal with as well. Today, I'm going to mention why I'm leaving mostly from the subreddit and decreasing Fortnite from my time.

First of all, the game is hard for me to keep up with. About after every nerf, you would expect to lay down and have a fun time to have nothing start slamming in my face like a meta but what actually happens is the community comes up with something around the new nerf and starts making another annoying and unavoidable concoction of a meta/tactic that has no way of going around that Epic doesn't care about and leaves raining on the community for just about forever without being nerfed. I'm talking about Fortnite 5.0.0 patch which nerfed double pumping but created the shotgun-SMG meta which hasn't been nerfed but actually had shotguns buffed with somehow having the community believe pumps were ""shit"" which got the pumps buffed. Sorry, but the pump was actually just fine on its damage, did you want to shred, give nobody a chance, and make people like me leave the game entirely. Bet you did.

Second of all, What's the reason to continue playing the game if you're just wasting time at a game that you are just stagnating at, even if you've been playing like an addict.

Finally, the game isn't fit for my playstyle. The game so far with its community isn't fit for people going for wins like me that try to play non-aggresively without being killed. Sadly, with Epic for some reason supporting OP weapons like shotguns, my playstyle would be frowned on by Epic and crapped on constantly, nothing done to help players like me, that chose to leave the community. Many casuals and non-aggressive players leaving. Also can't forget about former players like Optimus who left because the meta at his time was just too OP and had no workarounds that led to his downfall.

I will play Fortnite time from time but mostly creative or stw. Other games like Black Ops 4 have drawn me in towards them as they're better to play and more fit for me than Fortnite. 

Sorry, but I'm mostly leaving from Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

Building nerfs, explosive buffs,dinamite added, planes that can both shred builds with its turret or just fly thru it with no penalty, the sword and now the boom box.

Ive been thinking about the direction the game is heading,and i have to keep asking the question . what is the thing for you players that this game gives, that made you pick it up over other countless br options. For me it was mostly building, it sure as hell isnt the ""amazing "" rng based gunplay, or the skins that i can blow my money on,it isnt the challenges either. And the global events and storyline isnt it either. Its a cool addition, but it wont make the game what it is if you keep shitting on building every 2 weeks

And as for the devs, what do you think makes people pick this game over other BR options ? 

Please share your opinions on the direction the game has been going the past few seasons, cuz after seeing the downfall of h1z1 and pubg caused by the devs not giving a flying one about ruining what made the game great, im failing to be optimistic about this game anymore.

New items whenever a cash prize tournament happens to gain more attention so that everything looks EPIC and funny for those who have not played the game.

Not allowing people under 18 to participate in cash prize events, maybe because they aren’t legal or because majority of kids that want to be pro will wait until their 18, prolonging the game.

Emotes from popular dances to gain attention from the ultimate casual gamer, no other game is doing this..

It’s free, essentially any casual gamer would pick up a really decent free game in a heartbeat.

Creative, allows the chance for those who are aspiring designers or are creative in general to mess around on the game and create buildings to have a CHANCE for it to be displayed or for friends.

They make LTM’s so casuals play something you don’t need a skill set for.

They aim at target markets.

They also made public tournaments for players who are competitive, making them shut up about ranked matches and allow them to add whatever to the game, as long as it’s not game breaking.

Imagine dynamite in season 4, when bounce pads were a thing, a big no no.

But instead of thinking about removing and fixing some things, making the game run smoother and reducing RNG, Epic decided to put something else in the game you can pick up off drop instead of a gun. Not to mention the fact that all of these things just make the fundamental principles that used to rule the old seasons useless. This may be a “counter to building”, but the old counter to building, which was an RPG and 80 rockets, at least required skill to get. 

It’s not so much this new stereo box that annoys me, it’s that it represents Epic’s continuation of the same trend of adding more and more random stuff no one asked for without vaulting anything. Not to mention I’m sure this new item is OP, and either Epic didn’t know it’s OP and need to me more thorough and cautious with new items, knew it is so the look good and “listen to the community” when they nerf something they always planned to. 

Maybe I’m in the minority, but my personal preference would be for Epic to add an item for a limited time, get the communities feedback, and make adjustments before either deploying it or getting rid of it if the feedback is negative. They should not just keep rapid firing items and mechanics and seeing what sticks. I would personally rather have 1 balanced and well received item per month than 5 crappy ones per month. If Epic keeps adding 5 items for every 1 that’s vaulted, this game will die a slow, skill gapless RNG death.

The problem that I see, and why Epic won’t introduce It to the game is beside of the twitch and YouTube streamers. Ninja, Dakotaz, Sypher, you name It. They constantly get into lobbies with players that are vastly below their skill level, It only makes sense that they are going to get 10+ kill games. It’s fun to watch. If it’s fun to watch than more people watch, more people watch, more ad revenue, more viewers, more players spending money. 

You ever watch a streamer play in a competitive tournament? Other than the end game, they are boring. They turtle the entire time and get maybe 2-3 kills. Why? Because they are actually playing against players that are basically on the same level as them. 

Epic will never introduce skill based matchmaking because it’s not a way to generate revenue, no one is going to watch Ninja get 2 kills a game.

It’s like this. Would you like to see Lebron take on a HS kid? Sure, it’s fun to watch Lebron dunk all over this kid, doing windmill dunks and crazy crap. But put him up against Curry and all that goes away, because the skill is equal. 

As much as I think skill based would be a welcoming addition to a regular player like me, i just don’t see It happening. Epic won’t let It. ",FortNiteBR

This was optimized by the re-deploy ""test"", which was just dropped into all modes for 2 weeks, then removed. Almost all the polls I saw go viral had a more or less 50% 50% split in favor/ against re-deploy. These sorts of things should be implemented into a ""test server"", like the one we had for ""Shooting Test 1"".

 By adding things like re-deploy, planes, swords, ""explosive damage through structures"" and boomboxes into all modes, it just turns the community against each other. Some things are so obnoxious that everyone bands together and asks for it to be removed (Infinity Blade, Explosions through structures), but most new items are causing a split in opinions between casuals and people who try to play competitively.  Which ever side of the fence you are on, its worth listening to what the people that don't agree with you have to say. You have to understand that there will always be people who play this game very sporadically and don't really ""play to win"", but moreover to just have fun. More and more these people get down-voted to hell and their opinions seen as worthless because they don't align with a skill gap. Likewise, a lot of people such as myself have grown very tired/bored of just playing the public games with no real goal, whilst having to deal with implementations that seem to make skill less and less relevant. The Pop-Up cups are great, but the fact they aren't available at all times is arduous. Many times me and my friends miss out on the Duo/Squad competitive modes as they don't align with everyone's schedules, and when we do have time we feel forced to play the whole 5 hours because its the only real fun to have on the game.

I know for a fact I would grind the hell out of a comp mode whenever I had the time. Not anything to elaborate, a straight re-skin of Rocket League's system would suffice. This would also mean the ""casual"" mode would be much less skilled, perhaps reminiscent of the early seasons for a lot of people who miss those. It would also mean the casual mode would continue getting ""wacky"" additions that people would enjoy, whilst the competitive would be more bare-bones and skill based.

The path of the game isn't healthy, the competitive scene is becoming if not already a laughing stock, whilst casuals seem to have no place left in many games as the general population has improved mightily. This leads to neither party being content, the FortniteCompetitive subreddit being filled with people quitting, the main sub seeing an increase in posts like this one earlier today: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aavz3w/is\_there\_much\_point\_in\_playing\_fn\_if\_you\_dont/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aavz3w/is_there_much_point_in_playing_fn_if_you_dont/)

For the time being there is no real threat to Fortnite and Epic as no competitors seem to be anywhere near the same level, but the constant divides in the community, the ignoring of ""stop adding start fixing"" and no indication of what is coming next (""more news on Competitive to come with next patch"" never happened) is very worrying if such a competitor should come around.

TL DR: A casual mode with weekly additions split from a bare-bones SBMM competitive would solve the vast majority of complaints about the game, imo",FortNiteBR

I have a Vega 64 GPU so I have the AMD Radeon Settings app (where I made a custom resolution). I turned on GPU scaling and Full Panel but that didn’t change anything.

Does anyone have an idea how to solve this? It’s kinda frustrating that it’s not working. Also, when I tried default resolutions already on the PC such as 1400x1050, they appear stretched - it just seems that the ones I make ‘don’t work’.

Make footsteps sounds clearer and louder and make the sound when someone jumps on you so you can actually react and not die to literally anyone abusing camping.

Make weapons to less damage to structures, absolutely obnoxious that you can spend 100 mats for walls to get destroyed in 4 seconds with gray AR.

Decrease the number of explosives you can take and its damage. Or consider removing it lol.

Remove planes because its not competitive or fun to go tilted and die to a team that went frosty, took 4 planes and spammed whole tilted out.

Fix building and editing delays and not placements because as said before, it is the only skill gap in the game and if you keep messing with it, it will become h1. 

Remove turrets and miniguns because there is not much you can do against it other than snipe the person abusing it.

Ill add more stuff when they come to my mind.",FortNiteBR

The infinity blade wielder had 400 health max. A plane user has 800-100 health and their long range attack is more consistent than the blades. They also can retreat if the plane is low on health and essentially gain a free rift. By the way, only one person can have the blade, but at least 20 people can have a plane.

I think this says a lot about the impact planes have on the game as a whole, whether or not we agree that it's positive or negative. But none of us can deny how they change how Fortnite is played, and how they alter the experience.

On one hand we have the people who are screaming for it to be removed, then you have the people who defend every aspect of the planes and say stuff like ""Just do ____ lol"" without any actual constructive conversation. 

Personally I think planes need to be discussed on a deeper level until everyone can come to an agreement on their place in the game and what they need to do so that the majority of people are happy.

Then maybe Epic can do what they need to do, whether that's keeping planes as they are, nerfing them more, or removing them (although that is unlikely as they are very tied to Season 7). ",FortNiteBR

-Standard 100 Players

-Standard Map + Weapon Spawns

-The first five items you pick up are the only items you can hold the whole game

-You can’t drop items to pick up new ones

-Consumables and Throwables once used, allow for the slot to be filled with something different

-Weapons can be “upgraded” to a higher rarity if another one is found or dropped by a killed enemy (Gray AR -&gt; Blue AR, Green Burst -&gt; Golden Burst)

-Weapons can be upgraded to Supressed versions if found (Gray Pistol -&gt; Blue Supressed Pistol)

-Weapons can be upgraded to Scoped Versions (Green Hunting Rifle -&gt; Purple Bolt Action Sniper, Green AR -&gt; Blue Scoped AR -&gt; Legendary Thermal Scoped AR)

-Weapons can’t be downgraded, so once you hit all legendary weapons, you can’t change your weapon Loadout

-Ammo and Materials get collected as normal

___

Any other suggestions? I think this game mode would be cool because it adds in a little bit of risk to what items you pick up at the beginning of a game. If someone is on you you might have to pick up an emergency Pistol, which if you win the battle, you will have to keep it for the rest of the game, which sucks. However if you wait to find a better weapon, you might get killed or it might pay off and you get a really good weapon.

- Balloons
- Planes
- Grappler

Jet packs and balloons pretty much have the same problem especially when it comes to shotgun fights. Close encounters is something that people can use to practice their shotgun accuracy but when you have people floating around above your head where any decent shot with shotgun will more than likely be missed or do little to nothing you can't exactly get the practice you want and it doesn't exactly put you on fair ground, they have easy access to your head as they constantly have high ground and although they're not impossible to hit, it is a lot more challenging and mostly just frustrating. In general I'm honestly just sick of people using balloons, its probably become one of the most annoying metas ever. Balloons were fine until they gave you the ability to shoot from them, now it seems that's the only thing people ever use and its becoming ridiculous - remove jetpacks from close encounters and remove balloons either entirely or don't allow people to shoot from them.

Planes are simple, they can be quite cheap, you don't need to shoot someone to damage them, you can last an entire match in one and win (I tried to see if I could and it worked) they still have quite a bit of health, drivers probably aren't vulnerable enough, they definitely shouldn't be in certain LTM's and look they're fun, you can get to places faster etc but they as a whole just don't work and make the game a little unbalanced.

SIDE NOTE: as well as balloons, the grappler should be removed both these items take the fun out of building, they're not necessary.

This post is meant to be informative.

There is an insane amount of mobility in the game at the moment making third parties incredibly viable in season 9. It's nearly impossible to get into a fight mid to late game without getting third/fourth/fifth partied.

Here are my biggest concerns with syphon not being in the game:

• there is less shields available in general (sometimes you leave a HUGE fight with multiple third parties with low health and not enough heals to even get to a decent level of health for the next fight)

• when being third partied there is no time to heal after finishing the fight you were originally in

• there is no reward for fighting, in fact you usually come out worse off than you were before the fight 9/10 times. this encourages camping and waiting for a third party opportunity which is partly the reason for the amount of third parties currently

These are what I believe to be the core issues with the removal of syphon. Arena has not changed pubs (at least as a console player like myself) in the fact that endgames are still being played as if they are low level scrims with 10-15 players in moving zones. This becomes infinitely more difficult and rng based to come out on top because it's like playing an arena end game but without healing.

I think another thing to point out about the current meta is that the top 10 players generally have 0-2 kills total telling me that they were just camping for the win because thats the most effective strat currently. I feel like that says a lot about the game. Epic please consider rewarding kills again!",FortNiteBR

The great thing about the Burst was that it was a shoot and cover weapon it didn't have the spray capability like the scar did but it was great when you lined up 3 headshots.

Player A and Player B land in the same area.  


Player A is better than Player B and would beat him in any even matchup.  


Player A's house had a white pistol   


Player B's house had a blue tac  


Player B w keys to Player A's house and headshots him with a tac.   


""It's a BR game""  


In what world does that mean anyone would want under performing weapons that are going to be dropped for ANYTHING else?   


Having tiered loot is still a good factor of RNG, there's 2 or more of every type of weapon, each one with a specific advantage over the other.   


The problem is regarding whether or not removing bottom tier weapons would hurt the casual community, who rely on that luck factor to ensure their games don't end right away. But the odds of them getting a white pistol or even no gun at all are just as good, and there's no way at all that a casual player is going to take on someone more serious with a grey pistol vs almost anything else.  


There's also still bolt action snipers, the flintlock and scoped AR's in the game, which all serve a purpose but still aren't the greatest weapons to grab at the very start of the game. A casual player can still take a good player who only has one shot in a hunting rifle to respond with if they got an SMG, AR or Shotgun.   


TL;DR Remove the white pistol please. Green is okay.",FortNiteBR

Those splits in his contract are what Faze clan could have taken if he didn’t flourish and begin to make back their investment. 
Yes the contract sucks no one can deny that, but it’s also the equivalent of a rookie contract in most pro sports when you put it into perspective.
If Banks is telling the truth in that they’ve only collected 60k from Tfue then I’m willing to bet that the 60k was the initial collection while he was still growing from baby gamer to GOAT status.
Let’s keep in mind as well that it’s been said multiple times that Faze was trying to rework his (Tfue’s) contract for a while before the lawsuit and all of this went down.
All that’s been happening with the lawsuit and videos going out from all parties we as fans and consumers need to bare in mind that until it’s all said and done we need to just push all of this stuff to a back burner before we make up our decision of who’s the bad guy.
Is it Faze being an org that slaves it’s players, or is it Tfue for being a greedy brat? We won’t know until the end, so please just keep that in mind, have a nice day and keep grinding.",FortNiteBR

Tfue exibits this consistently during streams and constantly shit on the causal fans for liking the broken shit in game. I don't care how big you are, if you display arrogance and contempt you clearly aren't the best person. Banks exhibited this behaviour during the bar fight he had. I believe both of them are manipulative, just like how Banks is using his relationships with Tfue to deflect from the contract, Tfue is pretending to give a shit about people exlpoited by contracts, he doesn't and its just about money. 

What Tfue has done to Faze is extremely scummy, he didn't like the contract and decided to get it terminated. Instead of keeping it to just seeing if the contract is lawful he throws Faze under the bus with underage allegations. I'm from 
the UK and under age drinking was pretty common although no one gets pisssed before hand and with the legal age being 18 its seems to be a gross over reaction. Especially coming from the fact that Tfue has been seen willing to drink before. While the contract may be shit, the way he tried to get out of it was even shitter from a moral standpoint. 

People don't seem to undertand the massive benefit Faze brought to Tfue, he was a nobody and was only allowed in friday fortnite due to fact he was a part of faze which contributed massively to his growth. Faze certainly didn't 'make Tfue' but they played a huge role in it. And while he may have outgrown Faze, bitting the hand that fed you makes you a pos. 

Onto the contract its self, i understand Tfues dislike of the contract. At anypoint Faze have the right to collect 80% of the majority of Tfues earning. Tfue probably fears that after the 3 years are up and Tfue doesn't sign with Faze they will collect. That understandably is shit. Faze should have allowed him to renegotiate the contract so it wasn't so shit. However, Tfue is not without fault, he signed this contract and should have known what was stipulated and he was fine then when he was a nobody but its not fine now. This shows that all it comes down to is money. 

Neither Tfue or Faze have a moral highground, they  both handed shitty cards to eachover and only care about the cold hard cash.",FortNiteBR

Heavy assault rifle 
Now in Rare and epic rarities 

Tactical assault rifle - vaulted 
( This weapon is used more like an SMG than a fast fire short range assault rifle ... So it shouldn't stay in the game any further 
To make up for it a similar weapon is returning ..  ) 

Tactical smg - unvaulted 
This weapon now returns with epic and legendary status .. the damage isn't buffed .. this would make up for the Compact smg being vaulted ... 

Damage - 
Epic -  20/40 
Legendary - 21/42 
2.0 headshot multiplier ... 

Drum gun - vaulted 
Standard SMG - unvaulted 
( Back in same rarities ) 

So now the state of the smgs are : 
Suppressed SMG - most powerful SMG but slowest fire rate and structure damage .. 

Standard SMG - weakest , more structure damage , more fore rate 

Tactical smg - all rounder for damage , strongest structure damage and now longer range .. 

The submachine gun is now renamed to standard SMG ... 


Suppresed pistol - 
Damage is slightly buffed 
This weapon has proved to be one of the least used weapons in the game .. even considering how easy it is to find .. 

Damage changed from 
26/28 to 30/32 
Headshot multiplier stays at 2.0 
This would make up for the vaulting of the suppressed assault rifle .. 

Stink bomb - 
Now renamed to gas grenade .. to fit the theme of a battle royale game .. 
Rarity promoted from rare to epic .. 

Dynamite - vaulted 
Remote explosives ( C4 ) - unvaulted 
The remote explosives were vaulted a while back due to it being overpowered ... 

It's now back and nerfed slightly ... 
Damage - nerfed from 70 to 60 
Stays at epic rarity 
The remote explosives is a lot more tactical .. 


Heavy shotgun - unvaulted 
Damage increased from - 
74/77 to 80/85 
Headshot multiplier staying at 2.5 now means the headshot damage is 200/212 
The pump was removed apparently for accounting of 26% of kills in the game .. 
Considering how many weapons there are this means the pump is used over a lot of weapons .. 
The heavy returning as  a  more  powerful shotgun could result in the same as the pump .. but considering the lower base damage and the smaller crosshair it could be used slightly different ... 
So the heavy shotgun is now only available in vending machines and supply drops so it's isn't overused ... 


The heavy shotgun is a fast fire shotgun and so is the tactical .. there is no need for the combat shotgun anymore since having three fast fire shotguns would result in disaster .. 
Combat shotgun - vaulted .. 

This will significantly change the meta of the weapons .. making a lot more weapons relevant and vaulting / buffing useless weapons",FortNiteBR

Quitting out at start of Downtown Drop does work for the Top 10 Fortbyte challenge. I let the match start, slide down the hill a bit, then Leave Match via the menu.

Caveat: I've only tested the quitting at start method when I had no more than 10 out of 16 players in the game. It's possible you may have to complete for coins when there are more than 10 players. I'm not sure since all my games were capped at 10 tonight.

Regarding platform, this is working for me on PS4. [Just hit 100](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D7OVdR9U0AAjciN.jpg). Took about 30 minutes to go from the high 70's to 100.

And I know Polar Peak was hit during the event just before Season 9, but I haven't personally seen any changes to the iceberg since I initially saw that fat crack in the side of it. 

I don't even really see the snow biome as a good place to land at. With the rest of the island you can blend in pretty well with the environment, but in the snow biome, unless you have a white skin, you'll have a hard time blending in. And not blending it means you'll probably get shot at without you even noticing where the guy who shot you was. Granted, camouflage has probably never helped anyone win a game, but it's annoying as hell to just be walking to the zone and somebody just shoots you randomly because they were able to spot your character easily in the snow.",FortNiteBR

(Problems and Solutions),"What is this weapon doing in the game still? It's way too low risk/high reward and outclasses other options by a mile. Vault it, or fix it. It's been here since the 8.2 content update with no adjustments...

Problems:

* Shotgun ammo is too common/accessible.
* It's incredibly difficult to tell where shots are coming from. While that may be the point, it does way too much damage to warrant the level of stealth it currently has.
* Minor gripe, but you probably shouldn't be able to hold a drawn bow forever. Lots of games (like your own Gears of War Torque Bow) have cooldowns on how long you can keep a bow drawn.
* The Boom Bow is overall just too versatile for its own good, and the good of other items in the loot pool.
   * One slot can easily be your sniper, rocket launcher, half a shotgun, and even a throwable.
   * Has better stats than most of those items too.
* At Legendary rarity, it outclasses:
   * Legendary Suppressed Sniper
      * Damage (115 vs 105)
      * Reload Time (1.3 vs 2.7)
      * Downside: No scope, but the explosion radius is big enough to not require anywhere near the accuracy/skill needed for snipers.
   * Legendary Combat Shotgun
      * Damage (115 vs 80)
      * Some engagements you just get near/above someone and aim at the ground. No impact (or effort) needed.
   * Legendary Hand Cannon
      * Damage (115 vs 78)
      * Fire Rate (1 vs 0.8)
      * Reload Time (1.3 vs  2)
      * Why even pick this up over a Boom Bow?
   * Epic Rocket Launcher
      * Damage (115 vs 116)
      * Fire Rate (1 vs 0.75)
      * Reload Time (1.3 vs 3.4)
      * Downside: Structure damage is worse. But other than that, why pick this up?

Some Solutions:

* It's an explosive bow. Make it use explosive ammo. Change the arrow design from a shell if you have to.
* Significantly reduce its reload time.
* Add an arrow smoke contrail in the air that lingers for a very short time to tell where shots are originating. Punishes rapidly shooting it at far off enemies just to get splash damage hits.
* Add splash damage falloff so misses aren't as rewarding.
* Increase draw time, while also having damage scale based on that time. Should prevent quick shots at the ground at close range. Damage could also be based off distance the arrow traveled to make it more range-focused.
* Have a limited amount of time you can keep the bow drawn before it just shoots. If the bow were to use explosive ammo, then this makes shots more meaningful and less spammable.

TL;DR - Boom Bow is a Busted Bow. It desperately needs a vaulting or a nerf in several categories.",FortNiteBR

As far as I can tell, this one was pretty damn good. Hotspots are an interesting addition that favors the more aggressive players, Semi-Auto being un-vaulted gives us more variety within our scoped weapon lineup, and the audio improvements seem really nice as well.

To top it all off, the new Jordan crossover gives us two very interesting epic skins for an almost 50% discount, the skateboard backbling that has an insane amount of styles each with different and creative art, and an LTM that finally shows the creative side of the playerbase a little love. 

What on Earth is wrong with this patch? All I see people complaining about is the Undo button and Combat availability nerf. The Undo button being pushed back is disappointing, but honestly I'd rather have a fixed refund feature than a buggy one that may not work properly. As for the Combat's availability, really? It's not impossible to find even after the nerf. It makes it so it's not a priority to have in a close-range fight (since less people will have it), but not so bad that it can't be found. The whole point of the Combat was to make close-range combat less linear; is this really that suprising?

So yeah...Is this just complaining for the sake of complaining again? Or is there actually something wrong with the core intentions of this patch. Because I honestly think this is the best patch we've gotten in a long while.",FortNiteBR

A question involving the recent post about the Harassment Policy Update:

&amp;#x200B;

Would this include posting screenshots of posts that were removed by a mod even though they didn't break any guidelines? There's quite a large amount of these posts... Almost a disturbing amount....

&amp;#x200B;

Also, if I were to reply to a mod saying ""removal nazi"" that has removed a post that didn't break the guidelines, would this be considered as harassment? There's been a lot of controversy involving the mods and the removal of certain posts. I feel that ""removal nazi"" is not harassment, merely a statement that reflects their behavior.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a serious question and would love to hear feedback on this matter. Thank you.

The skill gap is wayyyyyyyyy too small, all you need to do now is spam someone enough and you’ll win. There has been way more fun seasons, and I think most can agree on that. But ever since season 9 started each update has just been worse. They vault the pump (still don’t see why they would) and bring out the combat, now most people use the combat and the tac still sucks. This update, they nerf the spawn rate and make shadow bombs harder to get. Lots of my friends I use to play with (last season) have just stopped playing. A lot of people aren’t enjoying this season whatsoever. This isn’t just a paragraph of me complaining, it me hoping for change. 

**What do I want changed?** 

 Farming gives more mats, unvault pump, vault drum gun, vault tac shotgun, squads has siphon because it’s a pain in the ass to get shield in squads, change arena so it’s like real ranked not play like a pussy til the end just for placement points, make skins better (I think the new skins coming out are just horrific), bring back guided missle but make it do as much damage as a normal rpg, vault rpg, bring back shockwaves and vault impulses, console support so I don’t have playdough graphics, give custom codes to the public.


**TLDR** 

I think this season sucks, you might not agree but many do, changes I would like are above, increase skill gap instead of destroying it.",FortNiteBR

I bet that when Tfue signed with FaZe, it was the best day of his life, as it would be for any small content creator that seeks greatness. Yes, maybe Tfue did miss on some sponsorship opportunitites with Red Bull and Finalmouse but that's how exclusivity works everywhere in the world. No one can claim to know for sure if Tfue would have been as popular as he is today if he didn't sign this contract with FaZe. Those accusations about underage drinking, gambling and the age of highsky are really bad sports from him, even if it was his lawyer's idea. The first time i heard about Tfue is the day he joined Faze, plus, that Banks guy seemed to really consider him as a brother, beyond money, fame and all that (look at mongraal and cloak's statements)

That's not even the point, the point is that contracts are important and do actually matter, they are the guarantee that someone will deliver on what they agreed about, if contracts were to be broken just because we don't like them anymore or for the sake of profit, the world would be nothing more than a messy jungle.",FortNiteBR

At first I was extremely surprised that Epic would do such a thing, but slowly over time I got used to it. Now I actually prefer the combat over the pump for a few reasons. One, it has a faster fire rate, so you can sometimes get two shots in a build battle before the opponent places a wall to block your shots. Two, it has a smaller/lesser damage drop-off, so you can snipe some people from far away (30\~ meters) and still deal a good amount of damage. If epic gave us the choice of vaulting the combat and unvaulting the pump, I would vote no, but expect many people to vote yes. Thanks for reading.",FortNiteBR

Step 1: Load into your own creative world, and equip the coin (under devices)

Step 2: throw the coin, and copy and place the coins (100+), basketballs (50), and shoes (50) on your island.

Step 3: Start the game, collect everything, and then end the game.  Repeat if you need more coins for the challenge.

It's as simple as that.  I was playing the new Downtown Drop game mode and was only getting 2-3 shoes a game max and figured it would take too long.",FortNiteBR

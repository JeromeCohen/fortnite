People are switching to (you know what) because you log on, shoot, and have fun. Today, if you didn’t have a head start in the game, you’re going to get roofed, trapped, and have the Eiffel Tower built on you when you shoot 1 bullet. 

It’s extremely hard for casual players to enjoy the game without getting demolished unless if they’re playing in Team LTMs or with decent squad mates. All of my friends left for this exact reason (and I’m sure I’m not the only one) but only I stayed behind because I loved the game competitively. However, I honestly feel bad killing casual players in pubs because I know they just want to relax and not have a sweaty tryhard on them all the time. 

This game desperately needs a ranked system to allow both worlds of the competitive community and the casual community to thrive in instead of being on each other’s throats all the time. ",FortNiteBR

This means that it is becoming normal that there are 5 people left by the 3rd circle.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing you could do to make thirsting less efficient is only allow us to damage knocked down players with our pickaxes. This means that there will be much less thirsting during actual fights, when opponents are looking for extra health and shield. In addition, you could buff the knockdown health from 100 to 150, and make the bleed out rate 1.5x faster. This would mean that thirsting with pickaxe would take longer, and consequently less people will thirst in the heat of the moment.

68,xdgaymer69,1550993695,au5q1q,31,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/au5q1q/double_pump_would_be_balanced/,0,Double Pump would be balanced.,"In my opinion, double pump/double shotgun would be balanced in the current state in the game

The three main arguments in favor of it are this: it takes up two slots, and would fill a niche role, not necessarily being a must-have for all situations.
 
The first point is fairly obvious. Taking up two out of five slots is significant; that extra shotgun could be replaced with meds, shields, more explosives, or a sniper depending ot your current loadout. Losing that slot could be very disadvantageous as a result of having fewer utility available.

The second point might be a bit more controversial. Double pump fills a niche role. There is less need for a swap weapon than ever due to the rise in skill when it comes to editing and building. Currently, I see fewer SMGs and the only situations they are used is to follow up a pump shot. I notice a lot of the best players will shoot their pump and immediatly build, leaving little time for them to be shot. They will edit or build, and seek the next opportunity for a shot. They risk they least damage with the least amount if exposure to the enemy. This is why the double pump would not necessarily be overpowered. The user would have to expose themselves for a longer period of time to get the extra damage. It would be an aggressive, high risk-high reward play. 

And that brings me to my last point: it would not be difficult to counter. If a skilled player is going against a double pump user, they will likely expose themselves to the enemy for as short a time as possible; the multiple seconds it takes to pull off the double pump would be irrelevant because by the time the first pump had been shot, the other player will have built up cover or put themselves in a position not to be hit. Skilled players will likely be able to coubter the double pump relaitively easily.

Overall, I think that with a few changes or tweaks, like perhaps a slightly slower draw speed of a second pump, double pump would be a balanced and intresting aspect of the game that could potentially diversify the competitive and casual gameplay.

What do you think?",FortNiteBR

It is the player base that keeps a game alive as well as kills a game and we can all agree that recently, players have become noticeably aggressive and overall better at the game which of course is less enjoyable for newer players which decreases interest in the game. I think a Ranked System would do Season 8 well as the game will be fun for the less skilled and the more skilled if you separate the two and I’ll tell you how it works. A ranked competitive solo duo and squads playlist and you’d have a leaderboard that resets weekly. So at the end of every week the top 10 players for solos; the top 20 players for duos; and the top 40 players for squads would be rewarded. Each person getting let’s say 5000 vbucks (epic May increase this number to give more incentive to skilled players to play ranked.) And then the leaderboard is reset every week. The skilled players work their way up the leaderboard the next week for bragging rights and rewards. Meanwhile the less skilled will only rarely encounter very skilled players in public matches and thus have a more enjoyable experience for the most part. Tell me what you guys think.",FortNiteBR

While I will admit that both subs have their problems, I tend to agree with the Comp sub that r/FortNiteBR can be especially obnoxious when it comes to its hatred of good players.

Sure, it can be annoying to be eliminated by someone better than you are.  (Trust me, I know.  I am not that good at this game, but I would consider myself good enough to hold my own in pop-ups.)  Instead of getting angry at the individual that clapped you, how about you take note of what you need to work on?   If you are only willing to complain instead of improve, than YOU are the problem, not the ""try-hard sweat"".

I have played and interacted with tryhards and casuals, and I believe that the majority of the toxicity of this community can be pinned on the latter.  The frustration from the competitive players seems to be focused on flawed game mechanics and unbalanced items, whereas casual players are enraged about whoever killed them last.  This sub doesn't like players that put in work to be good at the game, but the competitive community has absolutely ZERO problem with people that play for fun.  That is because most of us were a noob at one point, so we have a better understanding of the casual mindset than you do of the comp mindset.

There's just a lot of stuff that casuals do not understand about the competitive community.  Do we ""hate fun"" because we think that planes are terrible?  Do we complain too much because we think that the Heavy Sniper is overpowered?  No, and no.  You can sit in a plane for as long as you please to earn Pop-Up Cup points, and dismantle builds and players with the turret whenever you please.  As for the Heavy Sniper, a single lucky shot can ruin a promising performance in the blink of an eye.

If you think good players are frustrating, I want you to imagine grinding this game for months and competing in an event only to be knocked off the face of the earth by a disgruntled plane.  You as a casual can always get better and do your part to shorten the skill gap, but we can't do anything about a broken item. 

Epic has no option but to add a ranked mode or a competitive variant.  That's clear at this point.  You can have your snowmen and chiller grenades and ATKs, and we can have our strategic, calculated, skill-based gameplay.  Until this great day inevitably comes, this sub needs to accept that ""try hard sweats"" are a part of Fortnite.  This game has been around for 18 months, goddammit.  There are going to be people taking it seriously, and that is perfectly fine.  You need to grow up.

When someone sees a streamers name or [streamer] in the kill feed they change how they play or pull up the stream. To negate this, allow streamers to enable this “mode” that doesn’t hide their name but randomizes it in the kill feed. 

Allow streamers to keep their name, however whenever they get a kill their name changes to something random, so that players in game can’t tell if it is a streamer or just an average joe.This mode would still hide enemy players names so that people don’t get their “5 seconds of fame”.

The answer is yes. With mobility options like the planes, which I'm pretty certain will remain well past season 7, there's no need to allow players to sprint anymore. It goes against everything the game is. 

  Epic has been doing a great job at making this game not be a run simulator. Why not just completely remove sprinting so none can complain that the game is indeed one. 

  Then we add things like the skateboard which complety remove the need for running moreso than planes. Sure planes get you around. But can you jump while on a plane? The answer is no.

As he hasn't finished his battle pass yet, we decided to go into Rumble to knock out his elimination challenges (he is a massive noob and he cant use two fingers on one hand, so his keyboard keybinds are whack).

Heal on kill has absolutely destroyed the mode. 

For starters, matches seem to be incredibly out of balance now. There are no close games. The team that wipes the other team first, or gets the most initial kills, will almost always win. 

Why? Respawning at 100 health leaves you susceptible to being one shot by a body shot from a pump shotgun, or a body shot from a sniper. And 2-3 hits from any AR. Meanwhile other players, having benefited from heal on kill, are not vulnerable to such things.

Before this change, consumables shield pots were valuable items, and after about 20 kills for each team, most players had used up a decent amount. 

By adding heal on kill, they're totally devalued, and snowballing has become a massive issue.

Your out. Becuase your probably not gonna make it in time / or your in your own fight and can't come to fight.

So we didn't buy the s2 battle pass bcz we thought that (this is what epic said) ""Future seasons will be real money store purchases"". So we bought s3 bp instead of s2 bp, but it's almost season 8 right now and there are still no ""real money store purchases"". Ofcourse you can buy vbucks to buy the things in the item shop, but you can get them free aswell by just playing some Save the World (PvE) missions to get vbucks too.

This story in a nutshell, we didn't bought the s2 battle pass because epic games said that future seasons will be real money store purchases, what still didn't happend. So they actually gotta bring season 2 battle pass back (or just for the people who played back then and bought the s3 battle pass instead of s2 battle pass) for misleading us.

I propose a new system to choose a winner in a fight, the one that would work a lot better in fortnite, all in tune with the opinions of streamers and reddit. Let's forget that silly casual mechanic that is shooting. Fighting should be all about building. This new system should detect when two or more players are building in close proximity, and start counting score dependent on build skills, that is a mixture of buildings placed, times and speed edited, and bonus points for most impressive and creative creation. There would be a timer on system, let's say 5 minutes (if any new fighter arrives it would be reset). By the end of the timer, the most impressive and creative builder will get to continue the fight, while losers gets sent back straight back to the lobby. I think this is the best system for fortnite, and expresses reddit  (and therefore all of the playerbases) wishes the best.

We also added some cool weapons that streamers will complain about and we will vault in literally 2 seconds.


Dual Double Barrel Scoped Infinity Blades: Available in Mythic, Godly, and ASCENDED variants. Does 997/998/999 damage to players and instantly wipes all buildings in a 1,000 mile radius and also nukes Canada. Find them in Chests, Ammo Boxes, Llamas, Supply Drops, Vending Machines, and Floor Loot.


Scooter: A single seated rootin tootin scootin machine! Spawns at every home and if it hits your shins you just die.


Vaulted: Everything except Pump Shotgun, Hunting Rifle, Quad Crasher, and Assault Rifle (Legendary Variant Only). We felt that there were too many items in the item pool and way too many mobility items, so now enjoy your 4 weapons and 2 mobility items!


Gameplay: Bloom is gone. Chests now give you 500 wood, brick, and metal along with every ammo in existance, including Energy Cells. We replaced every sound with the sound of Mr. Popo's parrot passing a kidney stone. All textures were handed to the PUBG team for a redo, so now the map looks like it was made by a 5 Year Old using watercolor paint. All OG Skin owners were given the ""I only play the game because I want rare stuff to make me feel better about my self"" style, which is just a default skin.

Where's the challenge?","The worst part of the battle pass for me has been how every skin ends up feeling like a default skin. Look at Lynx, Ragnarok, Drift and all these other amazing skins. People barely use them and instead use a shop skin, soccer skin or default skin. I suspect this has to do with the psychology of skins being far too common with a hefty percentage of the population owning them. This reflects back on the whole ""Muh skin must be rare!"" thing, sure, but I really do think the battle pass should be more challenging to fully complete.

Purple Omega is a decent example. It was a bit harder to obtain, at least for its time and this was great as it gave you more motivation to play a lot. With the current way things are, you can get all unlocks even after the season is over. I strongly feel unlocks should happen within the current season and should be a bit more challenging than an arbitrary XP grind or outlive challenge.",FortNiteBR

#**This weeks topic is: The Block**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on The Block to base your conversation on. They have been in and out of the game a few times now and we think they deserve to have a potential overall feedback post. potential talking points are:

* Do you enjoy the constant variety of a new POI on the map?

* Is the block generally a good place to be early, mid, or late game?

* How is the loot? Do you feel it is always balanced?

* Should the block be moved on the map or removed? Due to the constant changes, is it not reliable?

* Do you support Epic putting fan created content in a live game environment, and potentially affecting live tournaments? 

Keep all discussion regarding this topic within this thread and give negative and positive feedback on this topic.

So I’ve been seeing a trend that is becoming more and more apparent as thirsting becomes common. Players straight up dip once they’ve been downed. This results in no shields for the player who just downed them. 

I don’t know if there can be anything done for the issue in solos where players are leaving just before they get eliminated, but shouldn’t we be getting granted shield if we down them and they leave game? Maybe a matchmaking timer for bad sportsmanship to prevent early leaves of recently downed players?

They are doing what they are doing as they have a roadmap of plans for the users, they have up to Season 9 planned as stated allll the way back in Season 3, who knows how many more Seasons they have planned by now since then! 

The game has an INSANE amount of plans for the game for 2 whole other seasons as far as we know, and who knows from there? Now another thing, **Fortnite is not dying, Twitch viewers don't contribute to how much a game is dying, not everyone uses Twitch!** Fortnite is currently at the end of its Season, people are playing Apex because they are waiting for Season 8 to begin. There have been numerous accusations of the game dying and yadda yadda. Everything is not done because of another game, that's just not how game development works when there's months to plan ahead for. Season 8's beginning will bump everything back up because of a brand new season of things to do and look forward to.

#This weeks topic is: **Zombies**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on Zombies to base your conversation on. They have been in and out of the game a few times now and we think they deserve to have a potential overall feedback post. potential talking points are:

* Is it a more efficient way to gain loot and materials or are there better ways of looting?
* How much of an impact do zombies have late game, in terms of gameplay?
* Are they more of a useful asset to the game or an inconvenience?
* Could the spawn rate be adjusted for certain points within the game, if so, how much?
* Should loot drops from zombies provide more or less loot to provide balance?

Keep all discussion regarding this topic within this thread and give negative and positive feedback on this topic. You are free to express and discuss your feelings on this topic, its place in the current meta and anything which you may think should be changed about it.

However, this once present mechanic has been loved by a big portion of the community and arguably takes a good amount of mechanical skill to pull off perfectly.

&amp;#x200B;

This is my proposition to how double shotguns could work and not be overpowered.

&amp;#x200B;

How double shotguns could work in Fortnite:

&amp;#x200B;

When you switch from your first shotgun to the second and shoot, there could be a drastic damage falloff until you stopped switching shotguns for a short amount of time and until you reach the damage cool-down time. For example, if you switch from your first pump shotgun to your second, your first pump shot would do the normal amount of damage, but when you switch to the second pump shotgun, the damage could be cut down to let's say half the normal damage or even a quarter. The damage falloff would continue until you stopped switching shotguns and waited a short period of time for the pump cool-down time to reset. I feel like this would satisfy the players who enjoyed using the double shotgun switching mechanic and also the players who argue that double shotguns are overpowered. I feel like this could make the game more ""fresh"" and make the players who love double shotguns happy. I don't see any harm this could do if Epic implemented this into the game.",FortNiteBR

It is FAR to small.,"I played like 10 solo games today and I've come to a  realization.  Between the health-on-kill, deagle/plane build breaking nerfs, and the 3x faster turbo build all build fights turn out the same: Engage, Get on Top, Opponent Turtles, Wait, Wait, Wait... you get the point.  

Back then the counter to turtling would be explosives/things that can 1 shot builds, but right now the number of things that can do that are VERY limited:

1. Deagle - It still does alot of damage but doesnt 1 shot like it used too and its too rare to really depend on getting one every game
2. Heavy Sniper - One shots builds but has a 4 second reload and, again, too rare to find then reliably.
3. Dynamite - Fairly common, but they only drop is stacks of 3 and you have to reposition yourself in a way that will often result in giving them enough time to rebuild their box
4. Clinger - Common, probably your best bet for breaking turtles, but this is like the ONLY item that can work reliably

The game right now is honestly pretty boring for the people, like me, who like risking it all for the adrenaline because buildfights just turn into turtle wars.  What I suggest is adding back vaulted items that really didn't need to be vaulted and making changes to turbo build.

1. Add back Shockwave Grenades, they were useful your blasting through builds and making the turtler have to think
2. Add back Normal Grenades, these were the most common types of grenade and worked very well for breaking turtles due to the way they bounce and their moderate explosion radius.
3. Make Deagle do 125 to builds to make it not as useless against boxes
4. (UNPOPULAR OPINION ALERT) Turn turbobuild down to .10 seconds. The way turbo build is right now allows turtlers to sit and hold the build button because no action in the game can allow you to get in someones build while they're building at 20 builds a second. Previously turbo build was at .15 which was a bit too slow and allowed people to walk into builds easily so a .10 speed should allow people to walk into builds wiithout making it too easy.

# TL;DR

Loot pool is too small, people are turtling too much with no consquence, and matches stagnate a lot because of it.

This may sound like a 9 year olds excuse to have access to OG items, but I really think its not fair. (Sorry if some parts dont make sense, I copied my conversation with a friend from Discord and pasted it and editted it to look normal.) ",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Bring back pump and heavy, even the two out for different play styles in competitive.

How would epic do this?

* reduce the damage of the pump to 80 uncommon, 85 rare, 90 epic, 95 legendary.
* make each shot have 2x headshot dmg
* increase drop off dmg, so pump is used more frequently in close range, **this is where the heavy comes in.**
* Heavy shotgun 80 or 85 epic, 85 or 90 legendary \[i cant decide on the dmg lol\]
* 2x headshot dmg
* decrease the drop off, so it used constantly in long range fights where it will be incredibly dominant **especially in extra stacked tournaments.**
* Tac has been buffed an is pretty balanced.
* Vault Combat shotgun since its incredibly sh!t.

Pump and Heavy **will not** be able to one-tap, which will reduce aggression. I think the return of the heavy would result in a nice balance in scrims. More chance of mid/high grounders using the heavy to damage opponents for a lot over a mid range but also usuable in short range combat. Pump used more for the low ground warriors who pick up lots of rotating players.

Anything you would change about this?

IMO the game would be best with only rift-to-go's and jump pads. Both stored in the utility slot and both with increased spawn rates.

Its a good idea in general but to unlock the Secret Skin through Fortbyte is so stupid. 

I am a casual player who works 5 days a week, **plays on Saturday and Sunday for 3 hours each day.** Where I spend 1 hour in **Team Rumble** doing my weekly challenges, and the rest playing random squads.  My goal each season is to reach **100 tier** by doing weekly challenges and stacking the daily challenges. 

Now I have to spend **extra time collecting all the Fortbytes**, fine, I am ok doing that, but the recent Fortbyte where you need 3 other players to get the pressure plate thing. When I am going to be able to play Team Rumble, most people would have been done with their challenge, and no one will be willing to help.

Please don't make challenges so hard that it becomes a pain in the ass to finish.

All the pumps would have a 2.25 headshot multiplier because it rewards good aim and all the pumps deal under 100 bodyshot damage except the gold one but instead make the gold one exclusive to supply drops and vending machines. The green pump does 80 body and 180 damage headshot. The blue pump does 85 body and 191 headshot damage. The purple pump does 90 body and 202 headshot damage and lastly the gold pump does 100 bodyshot damage and 225 headshot damage. The reason that the gold pump will one shot on body is because to give noobs a chance to feel good and of course higher skilled players aim for the head and deal more damage.

And when the double pump was in the game it was the coolest thing ever becouse you could just wipe intire squads in crazy build fights with it. Now all you do is build and if you get highground you pull out your drumb gun and start spraying and they cant do anything. You cant eaven fight with a shotguns becouse Epic removed the pump and the rest of the shotguns suck.

Remember when rocket rideing was fun yea that was a good time but they killd it like every fun thing in the game becouse they added vehicles.

The problem is, I suck in solos, especially when I am on top 10, so I want some tips to improve.

Here I will write things about what I alredy know or about my playstyle so you don't have to waste your time asking:

Loadout: 

Slot 1: Sniper or Boom Bow, if I can't find one of them I use RPGs, GLs or even scoped and normal ARs.

Slot 2: Combat Shotgun, if I can't find one I use Double Pistols or Tac Shotgun.

Slot 3: Dum Gun, if I can't find I use the P90.

Slot 4: Shadow Bombs, Stink Bombs or Rift-to-go, if I can't find them I pick a 2nd healing item (majority of time is Big Shields).

Slot 5: Healing item, always Mini Shields or Bandages.

Playstyle: 

- I play passively.

- I only enter a fight if necessary.

- I am always rotating.

Things I alredy know:

- I know how to do 90s.

- I know how to do a ramp with wall and foor.

I feel like Epic is trying to cater too much to the less than casual crowd, and is taking advice from the majority (which are the bad players, most obviously.) and not taking any advice from influencers that have helped the game develop and thrive in the past (the minority, of course.) Everyone shits on streamers for complaining or thinks their opinions are invalid because they‚Äôre the minority and not everyone is a pro, but it‚Äôs those opinions and complaints that make the game enjoyable for the casual crowd in the first place.

Let‚Äôs look at it this way; let‚Äôs say you have a home that houses 1,000 people, and 850 of those people are children and the rest are adults- which would *you* put in charge of providing for the household? If you‚Äôre thinking logically, you‚Äôd pick the adults because they can better provide for the household, and have more knowledge on how to survive and thrive. My point is that while streamers and pros complain and it‚Äôs annoying, it still shouldn‚Äôt make us write every well thought out complaint as just an invalid opinion for the sake of drama or because they died to **x** weapon, because turning a blind eye to unhealthy additions of the game and playing devil‚Äôs advocate will inevitably make the game unenjoyable, and show epic that we‚Äôll stay quiet no matter what and just take the blows.

The problem with having the majority of the fan base vote for the future of the game is that the game will inevitably become less enjoyable for everyone, because the bar keeps lowering to cater to the worse players. Competitive games need pro advice for the direction of the game, because that‚Äôs what pushes bad or casual players to adapt and overcome the game‚Äôs current meta instead of being pampered and not improving at all. This will eventually lead to an unenjoyable experience, because you‚Äôll soon run into the problem of the game being totally based on RNG to win a fight, and it won‚Äôt feel the least bit rewarding.

So in essence: while pro players are the minority and complain a lot, would you rather let the people who only play the game for 1 hour on team rumble direct the game‚Äôs future? Or listen to the people who have been playing battle royales since the beginning?",FortNiteBR

Airplanes: Made a reappearance in the positively-received Air Royale LTM. The plane was also heavily nerfed prior to it being vaulted, which was only one season prior so it wasn‚Äôt missed for long. 

Grapplers: Came back in the icy LTM and the heist LTM, plus it‚Äôs technically still in the game via the mouseball. 

Bouncers: Came back in the low gravity LTMs and the Classic/Unvaulted LTMs. It‚Äôs also not as useful as it once was given all the other utility items that we have since it‚Äôs vaulting. 

Infinity Blade: Came back in the Sword Fight LTM, but it was also heavily nerfed prior to it being removed. Assuming it was even voted back, it‚Äôs possible that it would only appear at Polar Peak and be limited to just one sword. The LTM at least gives access to multiple swords that are retrievable outside of Polar Peak. 

Tac SMG: Came back briefly in Playground Mode and also in the Classic/Unvaulted LTM. Good gun but fairly similar to the Silenced/Compact SMGs. 

Drum Gun: Didn‚Äôt come back in a mode it was made for (the Wild West LTM) and it wasn‚Äôt even available in Creative Mode. Naturally, people would want an OP gun that was removed back in Season 5 that had never made a reappearance in any capacity.",FortNiteBR

It's Season 9. It might be a little too late, but is Fortnite a good game if you're a beginner? The reason why I'm asking this is that my friends ALWAYS talk about this particular game at school.

I played Fortnite before, but not on the Xbox One (I have an original Xbox One, by the way). I played on a Mac. So, I have the feel of how everything looks. Maybe not the recent updates, but I think I'll be fine.

I know it takes practice, and though I don't want to grind to get good. I have other games that I want to play, and it's not just Fortnite. But I do want to play with my friends. I want to also be as good as my friends, even though they played since the beginning. I also haven‚Äôt played any shooter games before, so that might be unfortunate.

I heard my friends say that people on console who played from the beginning are incredibly good, and they'll just kill you right away. Also, I read posts saying that it's not fun for beginners because of them. I definitely a beginner. I have nothing compared to my friends.

I'm worried to get the battle pass, because first of all, I'll only be allowed to play 4 hours every weekend, 8 hours every long weekend, and 16 hours, or possibly less, every week I have off, and that's my video game time. I don't want to spend it all on just FORTNITE. I know it takes 75 - 100 hours to finish the pass, and so I don't know if I'll do it, or get a lot of stuff. I want to also keep on getting a battle pass every season for free, and I need to do a lot of hours in order to do that, which I don't want to do.

My friends don't even play with me since I'm that bad. That's why I want to become average so then I can be useful in a squad.

So, what do you think? Should I play Fortnite from now, or should I not bother? Do you guys have tips for me? Anything you want to give that might help? All your info is valuable to me.

Thanks,

Deion F.",FortNiteBR

I mean does anyone not remember what the CEO had tweeted back a few seasons ago? How planes and one shot deagles were his favorite things during the time? ofc a clueless bot like him would find alternatives such as unvaulting broken items and keeping in horrid mobility vehicles. I guess everyone at epic is tired of being a bot and knew something had to be done so they can finally play their own game again along side the rest of the casuals. Go back to overworking the team that works on cosmetics while they sit around and push out crap updates along side shiet future ideas.

btw epic since youre already at it just unvault everything. Let this game be a complete mess of FORTNITE. Give everyone max health on kill, extreme mat farm rates, planes and hamster balls, re add environmental rifts and dont forget to just unvault everything so we can play the game in any fashion we want.

The pros, on the other hand, though occasionally missed their pump shots, have a much better chance of hitting every shot with the combat shotgun.

I‚Äôm aware their given reason was due to 26% of kills with the pump, but even without it fights will still end with shotguns due to building stopping AR fights. Instead, there‚Äôs just going to be new players hitting their first shots ever with the tac and pro players hitting five headshots with the combat. If you‚Äôre going to tell me to just aim better or play better, please consider that my stats put me in just about the middle of the skill tree so much of the player base likely feels and plays similar.

TL;DR - The removal of the pump shotgun benefited only brand new players and pros, and hurt the majority of the players.",FortNiteBR

Some examples:

\*Drum Gun - High damage, fast reload. In Team Rumble, people will land close and just blast this.

\*Compact SMG - High damage, fast reload, insane accuracy. 4 seasons and no balance changes.

\*Combat Shotgun - High damage, fast reload. 10 spammable shots that can easily kill even at range. 

\*Silenced Sniper - High damage, fast reload, silent. It should be two of these things.

\*Boom Bow - High damage, fast reload, silent. Get sent back to the lobby with no idea of how you got there.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not trying to come off like the people who complain about the game as a whole. The new additions to the map are cool, and on PC the game is running miles better for me than it did in Season 5 when I started to play.

I think at this point we should just stop. Honestly, if you don't like something in the game so much then you should just quit. Literally everyone is complaining about the smallest of things and that's just enough. I'll even admit, I've complained a lot on past seasons but I've only really complained about the pump gone and the bow being OP. 

Things like the Drum Gun for example are just going too far. 
I think the Drum Gun is fine imo, you see so many people complain about it but that's just the small yet very loud minority. The casual community is without a doubt the bigger one here and the unvaulting event proves an already obvious fact for those who couldn't realize yet. 
The Drum Gun will be staying at least until Season 10. 

Would be quite disappointing if Epic just vaults it cause the people who hate it, the minority, turns out to be the big streamers who can only express negativity and won't just shut the fuck up and enjoy the game. Enjoying the game isn't a thing they can do because all they can do is complain. Such a loud and annoying part of the community.
Epic can't do anything about them. The majority of the community just plays for fun and is considered a casual. They don't give a damn about anything, they just play for fun and enjoy the game. The other part, small loud and annoying yet full of big people to the game like streamers for example is the other dark half that will always complain no matter what.

They can't keep everyone happy. 
The cycle will just repeat. Casual item gets added, pros complain its too OP, it gets nerfed/vaulted, pros, the minority, praise Epic, casuals unhappy. 
Pro item gets added, casual unhappy, Epic nerfs it/vaults it, casuals happy, pros unhappy and angry. 
No matter how hard you complain the game will never be perfect. You're not the only person playing the game and your loud ass complaints are nothing. There are millions of players in the world who play this game, you're not the only one so the game will never be adapted to your liking, everyone wants different things and Epic can't keep millions of players happy at the same time. 

At all times there will be complaints from the community but this has gone too far honestly
Honestly just enjoy the game please. Complaining won't do anything. If negativity is the only thing you can express against Epic then you should just quit Fornite and move on.

TL;DR the game will never be perfect, you're not teh only person playing it and the game will never be adapted to what you like. there are millions of people playing, so your complaints are nothing. if you complain you're in the minority.",FortNiteBR

people have this mentality in their head that there is 0 counter to the drum gun and i think its making the game more toxic. i havent died to the drum gun that much because i dont give my opponent a chance to use it effectively. constantly moving and never trap myself in a 1x1 to make sure he doesnt get lucky shots on me through my turbo build...

I knew that if I played more I would become better and eventually start doing well, so like everyone did back then; I practiced and eventually within a month I wasn‚Äôt a complete bot.  I wasn‚Äôt an expert by any means although I knew how to aim and play the game.  Now today I would consider myself much better than I was when I was back then.  That is like almost every other game I‚Äôve played, you learn how it works and progress in skill as you play.  Although now a days, ever since season 5, it seems fortnite is catering to the new players more than ever.  If you look at patches where they add new weapons and change gameplay style / meta lately it seems like an overwhelming majority of what they‚Äôre doing is to make it easier to new players.  It‚Äôs good to have some things that helps new players out, although you have to draw the line somewhere.  I mean just look at recent patch notes and you‚Äôll see there is no denying that almost everything they  are implementing is to give new players an ‚Äúequal chance‚Äù as those players who have been playing for a long time and have learned how to play the game.  It almost feels like fortniye is paying no attention to its long term player base as they are constantly fluctuating gameplay mechanics forcing the current players to change their play style as new players pick up the game and don‚Äôt notice.  It‚Äôs clear that fortnite is not adding anything to help long time players as there is no option to turn off the HUD button keys and I have heard no talk of them doing that anytime.  Especially with the new shotgun.  They made it so you don‚Äôt even have to aim very well because you can just fire another shot half a second later.  And now they‚Äôre adding things like the drum gun back, and I almost guarantee majority of people who voted for that weren‚Äôt around in season 5 to see how much it impacted the game and how insanely over powered it was.  And with the reboot vans people don‚Äôt even need to worry about dying in duos or squads because they can just be revived after their experienced teammate does all the work for them.  I mean they even added a new transportation system where you can just sit there if you‚Äôre not good enough to drive a baller, quad, or drift board. 

It is a lot harder to get better now a days since everyone is decent and with all the tryhard players.  This is why fortnite should add some kind of in depth tutorial system where people can get used to the game and be equipped with skills to do well instead of giving them free passes to do well without actually having to know what you‚Äôre doing.  I mean how are people ever going to get better if the weapons / gameplay mechanics give them a natural even playing field with people who have been playing for a while?  They‚Äôre not, they‚Äôre just going to expect fortnite to add some kind of mechanic that will make progression unnecessary.  

TLDR: Fortnite is adding everything they can to make the new players have the same change as winning as somebody is experienced.  This is problematic as people who have been playing for a long time can easily be eliminated due to inexperienced players being granted an unnatural advantage through game mechanics.  Fortnite needs to have a tutorial that will start players off with experience so they can progress naturally without the help of game mechanics revolving around them.",FortNiteBR

The state this game is in is critical, and if epic doesn‚Äôt do something about it, most people will stop playing. One of the things that make this game mostly un-playable is the pump being removed. Now I want the pump back, but there is many other solutions than unvaulting it. If epic doesn‚Äôt want to unvault the pump, then they should vault the combat shotgun and bring back the heavy. The heavy shotgun isn‚Äôt the best, and I am not the biggest fan of it, but epic vaulted the pump for a reason, so they should bring back the heavy, because that is the closest to a pump we could get. Instead of bringing it back with the same rarities, make it rare, epic and legendary. So we won‚Äôt only be finding tacs. Also, if they aren‚Äôt going to bring the heavy back. Then they should bring back the purple tac. Don‚Äôt bring it back with the same damage as a blue one. Give it at least 8 extra damage.


Another problem with this game right now is unrendered buildings, this isn‚Äôt too big of a issue. But sometimes it can be. If a building does not render by the time you land, you will either fall through the building or bounce up and down. This usually doesn‚Äôt happen late game, but early game affects late game a lot. So this glitch may ruin or make you even change where you land.


Another problem with this game is the drum gun. Oh boy, what have we done? We were the ones to vote for a gun to come back, yet we vote for a unhealthy addition to the game. Just nerf it. Decrease the fire rate or decrease the damage. I have seen people run 2 drum guns instead of carrying a shotgun. That‚Äôs how useless shotguns are and how dominant drum guns can be. Instead of carrying a combat shotgun, carry dual pistols, They are most likely to do more damage and you won‚Äôt be disappointed like when you think a combat shotgun is going to do more than 20 damage.

This post isn‚Äôt made to let my anger out, I just want this game to playable and fun again.",FortNiteBR

5. V-bucks in the pass would be replaced with XP for obvious reasons.

It doesn't matter if it gets that many of the kills. That means players like it and it isn't overpowered. Nobody really liked the combat shotgun, so it's getting ready to bring the pump back to the game again. 
The weapon itself isn't overpowered, but streamers whine all the time when they get killed by any weapon, and epic listens to the streamers. The shotgun was a perfect weapon, and I would run it every single time I played a game. 

Now the game is literally either chose the tac because you aren't gonna get kills with the combat, or just spray and pray with the drum gun or other smgs. 
The game isn't fun anymore without the pump shotgun, and it is boring me.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

I'm seeing that many people are upset about the removal of the pump from the game and the addition of the combat. I can see why. But I can also see the other side of the fence.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started documenting every game and making notes on what I can work on for improvement. Here is what typical entries looked like last month (season 8):  


\-First drop, didn't get gun. Dead.

\-Got gun, but he got a pump. No match for grey pistol. Instadeath.

\-Got a pump, but wasn't fast/accurate enough. Missed my first shot and got killed immediately. Work on flick shots. (I would then go to creative and do that for 30 mins).

\-Better game. One elim. On second fight, didn't build and got one-pumped to the head. Next time, prioritize protection over aggression.

&amp;#x200B;

My play used to consist of 10-20 extremely frustrating stupid games followed by a fun one.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is what my entries look like from yesterday:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Didn't get gun on rooftop. He took a shot with combat shotty, but I was able to escape. Realized I should have prioritized healing as I went into the next fight with 30 hp. 

\-3 elims! Was able to practice building between shots. Eventually got boxed in and did not turbo build well enough. (Went to creative to practice my reactions to being boxed in.)

\-Fun game. Placed #2 with 2 elims. Final player outbuilt me, but I did well and did not get flustered. Got several shots in, remembered to heal. But got stuck under his ramp. Practice double ramping/side jumping to regain high ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I am not getting one-pumped instantly with each player I meet, there are many more chances for me to learn and get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday was the most fun I've had playing the game since starting mid-season 7. With the pump gone, I can now last longer and games are more fun. Previously, I would forget to heal because in most fights I either got lucky and won or was completely obliterated. Now, provided I protect myself from third party snipes, I have a chance. If I lose a fight, RNG can still play a role, but more often than not, I can find something practical to improve upon. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, now that players are not being one-pumped regularly at the start of the game, it means that more players are making it to mid/late game which is more fun for everyone as well. I'm finding that there are fewer games where I farm for 10 minutes straight before meeting instant death with the first player I finally find. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other thing I think is amazing is the new combat shotty. Sure, it's not as powerful as the pump, but because of its long range, I am getting great practice aiming with shotguns. I love this gun. Last night I fell asleep replaying all of my combat shotgun plays in my head and revelling in how good it felt to actually be succeeding a little bit more in my efforts to improve at the game. In the past, if me and my enemy both had a pump, I could rarely get a shot off because better players would see me before I saw them first. Now, I can get shots off, and work on my aim. And I can actually aim with this thing!

&amp;#x200B;

I think that eventually they will bring pumps back...probably nerfed a little. (I'm betting they'll quickly nerf the drum gun to make it less OP as well.) When they do, I feel I'll be much better as the combat shotgun training will have improved my aim. 

&amp;#x200B;

IMO the shotgun changes in season 9 were geared towards helping new players enjoy the game more. It's certainly working for me so far.",FortNiteBR

The pump could one shot players.  The combat shotgun can't.

So now we have pro players playing against 7 year old kids who have .2 KD ratios and the game now requires bad players to get two shots on superior players instead of just one.

In other words, if you want to beat LeBron James in a game of 1 on 1 you want to play to 1 point, not 2 points.

Anyone can get lucky, toss up a crazy shot and have it go in.  It's much harder to do that twice in a row.

Epic needs to reduce the skill gap because there's no way the current meta is sustainable for the casual player base.",FortNiteBR

The best strategy in Competitive Fortnite is to land away from others, farm up mats, avoid fights, play for circle position and hope you can get some kills in the final circle rotations when everyone is distracted. This is not fun to play or to watch. 

The entire match is watching players turtled in one by ones hoping that someone else will have to move first.

As a spectator, I would rather watch people fighting in/on/because of planes, ballers, wind tunnels, vents, ziplines etc instead of spending twenty minutes of my life watching the game from the inside of a one by one. 

I started watching and playing Fortnite because of the insane things you could do. The build battles, the snipes from vehicles, bounce pad/bouncer/plunger shenanigans, the insane what will they think to put in the game next attitude the developers have. 

The pros are angry because things like baller reduce competitiveness by increasing RNG and reducing skill requirements. But maybe rng is a good thing and maybe promoting the skill of being able to sit around and wait for something to happen in a one by one isn't healthy for the competitive future of the game.",FortNiteBR

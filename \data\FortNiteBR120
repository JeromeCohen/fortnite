9,Iain22,1547149692,aemo89,24,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aemo89/a_bunch_of_weapons_that_should_be_changed_for/,1,A bunch of weapons that should be changed for more useful weapons roster,"Lot's of the weapons in this game are pretty great. But I still feel some weapons are in a state where they are just filler and early game crap weapon. I'm going to make a list of balance changes (and some new weapon ideas) to weaker weapons that would add a lot more viability to different weapons.

Pistols: The entire pistols roster is complete garbage and is outclassed by all weapon. The grey and green pistols are not even close to viable in early game and should only be used if it's your first weapon. The silenced pistols would be ok if sub machine guns never existed (btw they do). Plus being silenced isn't all too helpful when the person being shot can see the direction you shot them from. Pistols are close range weapon mind you that. First of all the silenced pistols is not what we need for a late game pistol. Late game weapons need to be significantly better than the low tier. Silencer and slight damage increase is not that. I suggest add back the blue pistol and make a legendary and epic pistol called the tactical pistol that ups everything by buffing reload (witch pistol already have a lot of) give it a magazine of 20, and has decreased bloom . This would fit in a similar role as a sub machine gun but would require constant reloading and manual firing. Then the grey/green/blue pistols should be 25/26/28 damage while the tactical pistol will do 29/30. Then I thought the the silenced pistol could have the same damage(46/48) and hitspeed(3.75) as the heavy AR but with only a magazine of 12. This would make it like a silenced revolver with decent tap firing and can be used at some ranges if not too far. 

The scoped AR's: The scoped AR's have been used by basically no one as at closer ranges there is the AR and at longer ranges and even sometimes closer ranges we have the sniper. No one wants to use a gun with a kill time of 3-3.5 seconds when you can hit a head and make them dead. The scoped AR should have effectiveness at more ranges than just at a mountain peek so I thought if it could have effectiveness at closer ranges than people will have a choice between regular and scoped AR's, better at range vs. better at less range. So maybe if the regular scoped AR's had the same damage as the Scar's (35/36 damage per bullet) but had damage drop off the same as a SCAR so it will have a lot less hitspeed but would be at least usable at closer ranges with the benefit of hitscan and would be basically the same at further ranges. Same for the thermal scoped AR it should have increased damage but damage drop off to make it's max range damage basically the same damage as it is now maybe let's give it 50/52 damage per bullet.

The six shooter: I am very aware that it is vaulted I just hate how Epic never tweeked this weapon and let it rot. It's a good idea for a hybrid weapon with better damage at close range and potential for quick first hit accuracy shots. But it had a smaller magazine than the AR, less hitspeed than the AR less overall dps than the AR more damage drop off than the AR much more bloom than the AR. It was a sad version of an AR. It should have been a high bloom powerhouse weapon at close range and revolver when aiming down. But it was neither. They should have made the damage 48/50/52 damage as it would be an extreme powerhouse up close but require tons of reloading and would have enough damage to deal ok shots at range.

Silenced AR: This is not the best way to do this but the silenced AR isn't as good of a tap weapon as the heavy and a bad high bloom sprayer. I thought if the damage of it was the same as the regular SCAR it could be a more used weapon. It doesn't need such bad adaptation compared to the SCAR as silencers aren't the most useful and being a bad sprayer is more than enough but the less damage is too much. 

Burst AR: I'm not sure on the current state of this weapon but I think the introduction of tap fire AR's sort of left the burst in the dust. Getting three shots is awesome but the second and third shot can sometimes be filler. I really enjoy this weapon but I think it should have had the same damage as the SCAR as the adaptation of 33 damage meant it needs to hit 7 bullets sometimes. But If you guys think it's fine than I'll leave it. 

Tac shotgun: This one is actually fine I just thought it would be cool to have a soloist shotgun that requires no swapping. This could allow more use of items that can be sometimes filler like boogie bombs. If they made a legendary and epic tac shotgun that would be great.

Minigun: Just like the tac this weapon is like a soloist submachine gun. The noobs favorite weapon isn't doing great and I realize it's a bit overly anti builds but if they made it meta this could also open up more use for more items. More chances to go double meds. If it did 20/21 damage this coulddo something, I dont know if it's too much or too little but it's something.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand if you guys disagree or don't care but I would like some of these weapons in rotation of the meta and add some spice to this game.

You earn experience or complete challenges and unlock more outfit alternatives, granted with the new Ice King outfit and having to out-live opponents it's something a bit different, but doesn't really change how you play... At all. You'll eventually get the highest tier regardless.


My idea may have been suggested before but if so, I've not seen it nor can I find it... So here goes.
☆ 6 new outfits which relate to each weapon type. You progress them by getting kills (obviously). 
5 unlockable tiers per outfit which get more epic the more kills you acquire. First tier perhaps unlocking at 50 kills and Tier 5 perhaps 500 and inbetween balanced equally. Personally I think the finally tier should be one helluva grind which may take a few seasons to get so you're always working towards a goal.

The outfits for each gun should be thought up and created by the community. But for an easy example, the outfit earned via using the sniper could start out as a simple soldier working your way up to an awesome looking ghillie suit (Looking nothing like the Bush).

Let's take boomboxes for example, Released and got instantly hated. It's a good item if used correctly, and everyone seems to forget that you can shoot it down, Wait what? I can shoot it down wow i didnt relaize that i had to make a post 2 seconds after its release on how dogshit it is!!! while it really isnt, just get away from the range of it or destroy it. Rarely any good posts about it, Just everyone crying for it to be vaulted. I belive its perfectly balanced now, no need for a change. 

&amp;#x200B;

Infinity blade was really OP yes, But they could have adjusted it too make it still a viable option but easier to counter, Instead everyone was crying about how OP it was and that it needed to be vaulted instantly, Shame really the weapon had good potential. They could have nerfed the damage to be around 50, Made it so you could take fall damage if you charged with it (Not the normal charge if you want to move, but like from height from lets say 30m) Made it so you gain less hp after a kill, made it so we have 100 shield and 200hp, Too much potential wasted.

&amp;#x200B;

Planes, Now i do agree the planes needs adjustments but thats the thing, they need adjustments they arent quite OP enough to be vaulted they just need to be adjusted. Like for example, Make the planes have 750HP or add a feature where you can have 2x damage multiplier if you hit the nose of the plane, or make it not destroy builds, remove the turret there are so many things you can do with it, but everyone is begging for a vault.

&amp;#x200B;

The community really needs to get more mature and adjust, learn and adapt to different playstyles, as they said they dont want it to be ""just build lol"" i know thats the iconic thing about this game, But you have to let them change some things without getting shitted on.

What are some possible downsides?,"Hear me out. At the moment, it's a fairly common thing that if you're downed in squads and the opponent has the opportunity to do so, they are going to finish you off and you're out the game. So what happens then? Well if you're with your friends, you're sat there waiting out the rest of would could be the next 20 minutes for them to die, or win, while you sit there and do nothing or return to the lobby and play some solos. Or if you're playing with randoms they immediately leave to go back to the lobby or on the off chance watch how the match plays out. It causes frustration, anger and separation with your friends (that you're likely online to have fun with) and more often than not, boredom.

Lets say you removed the ability for downed players to be killed and you've just come across another squad in a typical squad engagement and one of the opposing team downs you. Nothing really changes in that moment; the best you can do as a downed player is perhaps offer some situational advantage by indefinitely giving away info on the opponent as you meekly crawl around on the floor. But, that could easily be solved with downed players experiencing a blurred or fading screen like many other games do or immediately switching to squad spectate mode like it does now when you're killed. So back to it. You're downed and blurred and not doing much, but you can still hear how the engagement is going in party chat and offering moral support. Eventually the rest of the squad succumbs to the opponents and you're team is out and all back to the lobby. Not much has changed to how things currently are. But. Lets say your friends manage to down the opposing squad, and then they come back to revive you (probably after getting all the good loot!) and you all get to carry on with the closing circle to the next engagement. We get back to another 4v4 (or 4v4v4 etc) several minutes down the line and every one of the squad carries on enjoying the game. This continues until the last minutes of the game are left with a single 4v4 or even better multiple squads all battling it out for the win and therefore more variety within the final minutes of the game. You'd still have people getting downed. Still have 4v2v1 scenarios in those final minutes but it no longer matters if you're not revived anyway as the game is nearly over. But at least you don't have the mundane scenario of a 4v1 which is more often that not a foregone conclusion. It's not much fun being a lone player trying to fend off a whole squad of 4 unless you're a pro streamer/very good player (in which case you can and probably would be doing No Fill matches) and not particularly rewarding annihilating a solo player as a squad of 4 from several angles.

In my eyes, removing downed player damage would:
a) increase the amount of engagements throughout the game (more fun) as you suddenly have more full teams running about vs solo or duos trying to survive to the end and avoid combat when the rest of the team is dead.
b) increase the variety of those engagements throughout the game (more fun), with more emphasis on varied tactics with always having 4v4 and scenarios of pushing enemies back to try to revive downed players during a fight or regrouping from a different angle to take the advantage back when you're 3v4 etc
c) eliminate squad members and friends being fractured from the party and having nothing to do for x amount of minutes while they wait out the rest of the match.

I think there are more positives than just those three, but those certainly stand out for me and I'd love to see this implemented, even as an LTM. I'm certainly open to the idea however that there are downsides to the above that I'm blindly not seeing or thinking of, would love to hear them.",FortNiteBR

The thing about it is that yes, the purple and blue suppressed pistols can hit for a shit ton of damage if bloom doesn't fuck you over, but here's the thing, the suppressed pistol is never carried by anyone.

Why is this? 

Simple. The dual pistols have been unvaulted. Suppressed pistol may have great DPS but you want to know what it lacks? Accuracy and range. I swear to god after using that thing in both normal games and disco domination extensively, I have never had a harder time mastering a weapon like I have had with this one. It's so difficult to spam and it's so inaccurate with how big the spray pattern is and the damage dropoff really fucks the weapon up for me. 

And the thing is that now the weapon is pretty much redundant because the dual pistols, while not silenced, are significantly more accurate, do way more damage per shot with a 2 shot burst so it's 41 (blue) or 43 (purple) damage x2 and you can really wreck someone's shit with it. It's basically a closer range and refined version of the burst rifle but in pistol form. It has lower DPS but is way more consistent and manageable.

The suppressed pistol does 26 damage bodyshot  (blue) and 28 damage (purple) and that is a lot when you consider how fast you can fire the gun. The issue is how inaccurate the thing is. If you can land a few crits, you're certainly going to kill someone, but then again, you need to be close to your opponent and that would be shotgun or SMG range and it's not as if you can use it as if it were pump + SMG.  I tried that and I died nearly every time I tried it.

This gun requires learning trigger discipline and learning situations where you can get leverage out of it. 

But the thing about it is that it's not really redeeming enough to want to use since there are so many better options currently to use. ",FortNiteBR

Now playing sniper shootout is so awkward and just not fun as it used to be.

Everyone goes on pickaxe/awkward no-scopes fights instead trying to actually snipe and enjoy the LTM (Unless you like to die .

After playing yesterdays Sniper Shootout it hit me up and I thought about it, we need 1 single close range weapon for this mode to avoid this no-scope/pickaxe fights. 

**Adjustments:**  
\- OG Revolvers/Deagle addition.  
\- Killing a player with a Revolver/Deagle will get him Knocked Down instead of insta-killed, as of snipers: A player that got sniped and killed will get insta-killed.

I watched old gameplays from the first version and it was so good, fun and simple - now it is actually so annoying.

For people who didn't played old seasons and doesn't know what I'm talking about - I'll link a classic old gameplay of Ninja getting a 35 kills in this OG LTM, this is seems one of the most fun things to play on and even for nowadays plays it is amazing and impressive gameplay to watch.

So maybe we won't put dualies, but the OG Revolver/Deagle just fits perfect and does the job.

Let me hear your thoughts, I wanna discuss here in hope that EPIC will notice this thread and do something about it and try things out.

Seems pretty simple to me. Yes, planes suck. Yes, third parties suck. Yes, I know many want them vaulted. But if Epic won’t vault them, then they need to balance it accordingly, and this change is what I think will prevent the “ramming” meta that planes allow.",FortNiteBR

The RNG; in three points:

1. My enemy got shields

2. The chests dropped me Granades, balloons or etc as a consumables but not shields

3. The shields being so much important to deal with people with rare+ pump

Bonus: i didn't find a blue Pump + i didn't find a shield

So, there's a problem with health + super strong shotguns + RNG in the current game, it's easyto find a blue Pump sometimes, and it's easy to find anything in the chests, but not, (guess what) shields. Probably a very good argument could be used to argue about this post is the: ""drop safely and you will get a lot of chests and one of them will drop at least one pack of mini-shields"", but, let's be honest here guys, almost nobody wants to land on safe spots, because these spots aren't fun like ""hotdrops"", at least for decent/veteran players, we want fights dropping on places with people too, like close to where the bus open, Tilted Towers, Salty Springs and etc, and in hotdrop like this is what this problem comes even when i'm in a house alone looting. My suggestion to resolve this problem without nerf stuff or change the current balance of the game is: increase the shield drop chances, reduce the rarity of the mini shield to common or just add the shield gain mechanic by killing people of the pop up cups in public matches at least gaining 25 of life + 25 of shield or just shield (when the life is full).

More inside,"Obviously the average kd is going to be around 1, and because about 100 players the average win rate is going to be around 1%. That’s unlikely to change.

But compare an average fortnite player vs a high level fortnite player, and then compare them to an average CSGO player (nova 2 I believe is the mean?) and a high level CSGO player. The mechanical/gamesense of the average fortnite player is *so much lower* than the average CS player. 

Obviously you can’t directly compare gamesense and mechanics between games, CSGO is taken much more seriously, and mean rank != average etc, but a 1kd player in fortnite is simply so bad at every facet of the game, and there are millions of those players. 

Even me, a player who started end of s2 but only really started playing frequently in s3 and had basically 0 prior shooter experience, and who only had ramp bound (no other build binds bound, I hit ramp and scrolled if I needed a floor or ramp), on a broken monitor, still had a kd of like 1.5 after a couple weeks (maybe 10-20 hours) of playing. 

Is it because they’re kids? The average age is lower than CS? Is it because for a lot of people fortnite is their first/one of their first shooter games vs something like CS where it’s not exactly a beginners game? Or is it because people struggle to understand the new mechanic of building? Is it because BR is harder to learn (larger map, chests etc)(although the average player of other BR games seems more skilled than the average FN player. In saying that I’ve barely played other BR games because I find most of them very slow paced)?

Before the buffs I felt like it just needed a bit of a buff, not a large one like what we have now. Sure it feels amazing to pull this 200-220 damage that take quite a bit of skill, but the damage is just way to much compared to the other shotguns. Not necessarily the headshot damage but the average damage which is quite high to the point that something like the heavy shotgun is to weak compared to the pump even the blue one. Same goes for the tact, though I guess it is more of an early game  weapon. As a side note the duallies are just way to inconsistent to match any of the pump’s tremendous damage. I feel like we are on a point where picking anything else than a pump becomes a downgrade. Maybe the pumps need a nerf, just a tiny one. Or maybe the other weapons need a bit of a buff to compete with pump.

1. **Reduce shield spawns**  
Because it’s a game mode with respawn, people who just spawned in are at an inherent disadvantage compared to those that have had time to shield up. Solutions to this could be either a) reducing shield spawns, maybe only to mini shields? Or b) no shield spawns at all, and add a mechanic similar to Siphon where each kill gives +50HP or +50 shield.  

2. **Allow skydiving on respawn**  
I’m honestly not sure why this isn’t in there already, but forcing players’ gliders to deploy as soon as they respawn means they spend a *lot* more time in the air. Plus, allowing skydiving would reduce the amount of times people get shot out of the air before they even land.  

3. **Increase score target**  
Since these other changes would most likely lead to a faster pace, score target should be increased to 150 or something like that.

Now would upgrading to an 9700k help? Doing some quick research the single core speed difference is about 30% so do you think this will help me keep 144 fps or close to it?

Regular areas are up to 250-280 fps.

Let me start of by saying yes, posts like these have been made many times, saying X needs his code removed and Y doesn't deserve to have one. I got a creator code myself that is being used by quite a lot of people, I can speak from experience when it comes to the system.

Most, and I repeat, most Fortnite content creators on Youtube are milking the game by clickbating, hosting fake V-buck giveaways, manipulating the innocent and so on just for you to click on their videos. They don't care about your entertainment, they care for you to not have ad-blocker on.
The support a creator program is an escape ticket from all of that. The program allows us to still make money without trying to cheat the system, but instead, you want to make good quality content so that your fans will probably support you  by using your code. I'm not allowed to talk about howmuch I earn with the program, but I can say that if the code falls in the wrong hands, they will do whatever they can to make people use their code. I've seen people host fake giveaways, telling their viewers to use their code to increase their chances of winning, disgusting. I'm against Fortnite highlight channels, but I have DM'd some of the ones who don't have a creator code. They told me that they were ineligible for the program, yet some Fortnite highlight channels got a code for their own. This makes absolutely no sense since all of their content is basically the same thing, so why should one be denied and the other be accepted? This shows that epic games's their system is just not strict enough. I don't want to talk about jimmy, since we all know who he is and what he does. Many Fortnite creators got denied for the program without a reason, yet, some scummy channels got a code for god knows why. 

Epic, please do something about this, I love the game and I can't thank you guys enough for the creator program, but this is getting out of hand.",FortNiteBR

Instead of an update every 2 or 3 weeks to add a little something into the mix, now it's almost daily, with broken or useless items and Season 7 is the reason I quit. The snow stuff's cool and all, but the planes are absolutely disgustingly terrible. I can't count how many times someone has just left with a plane, chased me with a plane, or simply killed me with it. Planes ruined Fortnite, and I was raging all the time since I was dying in the dumbest ways. It was then I realized I both sucked at Fortnite and I wasn't having fun. And to me, those are the two reasons someone should play a video game. So yeah. No more Fortnite for me. If they at least took out planes, I'd play it significantly more.

Honestly, at this stage Playground is pointless because you are less limited on there while on Creative you can do much more.

For Creative, you pretty much have unlimited time ln there. You can build whatever you want, create custom matches and even fight your friends. On Playground, the only thing you can really do is fight with friends and make some cool structures, but Creative can do that already.
 
You can even share worlds on Creative which is a huge plus. I think Creative is way much better than Playground and should be removed. This can lead to more space for LTMs.

I'm going to lay out the pros and cons of the gun before I get to my point.

**Pros:**

1) Does a minimum of 150 damage, instakill with a headshot.

2) Has extremely little bullet drop.

3) Destroys any structure in one shot.

4) Has a scope (useful for long range engagements as well as scouting).

**Cons:**

1) Very loud when fired.

2) Takes the longest out of all the snipers to reload.

.

For a sniper, these are some extremely weak cons. When you shoot at someone with a sniper, whether they can hear your gun go off or not, if the bullet is anywhere near them, they are going to hear the bullet whiz by or hit something close to them and they respond by immediately building cover. For this reason, you typically only get 1 chance to snipe someone before they're onto you, and it's often not worth going for another shot. This is the exact same reason that the long reload time of the heavy is also a pretty weak con, because it doesn't really matter how long the reload is since you're probably not going to have another good chance at sniping them.

.

On the other hand, these are some extremely strong pros. Being able to do 150 damage with *just a bodyshot* to an opponent before they can even react seems like a lot. That kills anyone with full health and minis. It's pretty uncommon to find anyone with full health and shield once you've reached late game (especially in solos), so chances are a body shot is usually going to kill someone at that point in the match. The entire point of snipers is to reward precision. This is also the reason why the lack of bullet drop is an extremely good pro. You no longer have to ""lead your shot"" in both the horizontal *and* vertical plane if your opponent is on the move. With the Heavy Sniper, you really only have to lead your shot horizontally, which makes it far easier. Not to mention, 1-tapping any structure is insanely good.

.

To summarize my points, it seems pretty unbalanced that the easiest sniper to use in the game is also the best by far. 

.

**Suggested adjustment:**

I think that the Heavy Sniper should definitely do less than 150 damage with a body shot, as I simply don't think any gun should be able to kill someone with full health and 50 shield without a headshot. I was thinking something like 135 for the purple and 145 for the gold would be much better.  I'm fine with it 1-tapping any structure and having minimal bullet drop, as that's what makes it unique. But I genuinely think this gun should do slightly less damage on a body shot and then it would be much more fair. 

.

For the sake of context, I am an avid Fortnite Switch player and have played since its release on June 12, 2018. I have spent $450 USD so far and plan to continue. I have just hit 900 hours played on the game, so I have spent a lot of time enjoying this game. Coming from an ex-CoD Wii player, I know what it feels like to be truly abandoned by a gaming company. So I want to start off by saying this is not the case here, and Epic Games is the most responsive and openly accessible gaming company I've ever seen. I love how easy it is to interact with them and give them feedback that actually results in changes. You guys are awesome.

That being said, The Switch version is obviously isn't their top priority and it shows. Below is a list of things that are Switch specific and need to be fixed. It's definitely more important to get the major ones. Please feel free to add to this list for any ones that I missed out on. 
   
**-Default City-**  
I'd estimate somewhere around 60% of skins are appearing as the default Ramirez skin, despite what players are actually using. This has been an issue since sometime near Season 6's start, possibly before. Players in your party including yourself are not affected and these skins will show up in gameplay definitely. Backblings and pickaxes are also showing up on every player as well, just not the skins. This is considered major because people like me who have spent $450 or ""OG's"" who have skins like Black Knight are being reduced to a no skin. What's the point of spending money if I don't get to individualize myself? This also makes it difficult for teamwork communication in instances like ""I hit the Ragnarok for 60"", when I don't even see a Ragnarok.  
  
**-Game Crashing-**  
Occasionally my game will crash and boot me back to the main menu for Switch. This is a relatively new issue that began sometime late Season 6. Usually happens right when the match finishes and I return back to the lobby (thankfully), but there have been a few times mid game. I had this error occur three times to me just yesterday. A Switch notification pops up and says ""The software was closed because an error occurred.""  
  
**-Framerate Drop-**  
Obviously the Switch isn't the most powerful console, I get that. With the most recent ""performance enhancing patches"" for the Switch though, the quality of the game has gotten worse and we haven't received an update in a while. Our peak performance was mid to late Season 5. I remember this very clearly because there was an update and the drop from the Battle Bus looked so smooth. I could land at Tilted with no issues.. until the next performance enhancing update was released and ruined it all. And the next one which ruined it further.  
Now I'm no framerate expert, but my guess is the game normally runs at 30FPS. When landing at high traffic areas like Tilted Towers or Retail Row, my framerate drops to what I'd put at between 10 and 15FPS for about 15 seconds. It will go up to what feels about 25 unless I get close to people. My cross console friends make fun of me by calling me the radar because if my framerate drops, they know someone is nearby. After the start of the game however, it reverts to 25-30FPS and is playable for the most part, with few exceptions (usually when fighting someone or plane related).  
  
**-Texture Drop-**  
Another late Season 6 era thing on the list, whenever I boot up the game, everything looks fine in the lobby until I switch tabs. If I go to locker, shop, anything, the entire texture of my skins get blurred out similar to an N64 style. I can't see high details so it makes buying skins in the shop annoying because I need to look them up on the internet or buy them based off of the image, because as soon as I see the model it's a blurry mess. I mean, what's the point of buying skins if other people can't see them in game and I can't see them in lobby?  
  
**-Music Shutdown-**  
Anything song based shuts down a few seconds in. I'd say this bug popped up near the start of Season 7, but it may also be late Season 6. This affects all emotes. For instance, if I Orange Justice (both in lobby and match), the music will disappear about 1-2 seconds into the song. I won't even hear the lobby music, no matter which one I have set.  
  
This also applies to the music in the Night Club POI (South of Shifty Shafts) which provides an unfair advantage for me vs non Switch players. Playing crossplatform last night, I was able to hear an enemy inside of the nightclub that my friend could not and was able to locate him, when he probably couldn't hear me.. simply because the club's music wasn't playing for me. Something interesting I've noticed about this one in particular is that it starts playing quietly when I leave through the second story side doors, but once again for only a second or two.  
  
**-Career Tab-**  
This might sound minor but for someone who has invested as much time as me into this game, I want to see my statistics. I honestly find it hard to believe that it's processing power that's holding this one back. I mean, I get it with the Replay Mode thing, but this is silly. In fact, when Season 6 ended I even got the summary email that had my statistics from the Season.. and I have never played on anything besides Switch. Does this mean the records are being kept and we just can't see it? What's the reasoning for this? Honestly, I wouldn't mind hearing a ""No you can't have this feature"", I just am inquiring why.  
  
**-Replay Feature-**  
Like I said above, I totally understand if the Switch isn't powerful enough to have this function. It sucks but I don't want to kill the Switch, y'know? However the Switch itself has the record-the-last-thirty-seconds feature that was very helpful for recording cool moments. Unfortunately this was removed in late Season 5 for ""performance enhancing"". This update that removed this feature was actually the first update that marked the decline of performance for the Switch, mentioned under the Framerate Drop subpoint. Mix this in with no Replays and Career tab, it's almost as if we're playing this game for nothing. I actually went out and bought an ElGato, but not for content on YouTube or Twitch, but simply so I can have something to look back on if something interesting happens. I would much rather have the 30 second recording feature back, especially since it was available during the peak performance era in mid to late Season 5.  
  
This is it for my list as of now. I'm sure there may be others but this is what I've come up with on my own. Please let me know if I'm missing out on anything.  
**Epic Games**, once again you are an incredibly communicative company and I am very grateful for all you've done for us. Even if something is unfixable or there is reasoning behind things, is it possible to let us know why? I'm sure others besides me would love to hear some of the things you have to say. Thanks again for the wonderful, free-to-play game that you are consistently updating and keeping fresh.  
  
TL;DR  
Experienced Switch Fortnite player lists Switch related errors:  
-60% of skins appear as default in game  
-Game Crashing frequently  
-Framerate drop since season 5  
-Texture drop in lobby  
-Music stops playing for emotes  
-No Career Tab  
-Missing 30 second record feature ",FortNiteBR

Full stop. That destruction should do 100% damage to the occupants as well. 
Most of us want planes nerf to the ground or completely removed, but we know that is a tall order for Epic. With all that planes offer to the occupants as far as mobility, utility and weaponry, the current state of planes is low risk, high reward. Making a change like this would make entering a plane what it should be - high risk, high reward. 
This would make piloting a skill. Strafing opponents on the ground would be dangerous, as it should be. If you want to use a plane as reusable mobility, you would have to land it, as it should be. 
I’m sorry, I know we are all sick and tired of talking about planes. But I feel like this suggestion is the grey area between “Just vault them” and “I’m quitting until they are gone” that we are all looking for.

# Points System (SOLOS)

***Please give suggestions on points as many people seem to disagree on this***

* **Placements:** \&gt; Top 25 ( [u/Claaaayster](https://www.reddit.com/u/Claaaayster) )  

   * 25*th - 21st:* 1 point
   * 20*th - 16th:* 2 points
   * *15th - 11th:* 3 points
   * *10th - 6th:* 4 points
   * *5th - 4th:* 5 points
   * *3rd - 2nd:* 6 points
   * *1st:* 8 points
* **Kills:** 2 Points per kill
* **Assists:** 75+ dmg to a player counts as an assists if he dies in the next minute: 1 Point per assist ( [u/Claaaayster](https://www.reddit.com/u/Claaaayster) )
* **Getting Killed** **(** [u/Pker2](https://www.reddit.com/u/Pker2) **)**  

   * 100th-76th: -6 points
   * 75th-41st: -4 points
   * 40th-16th: -2 points

Losing points would actually make the system viable. Otherwise it's impossible to categorise and divide players by elo as your elo would be forever growing.

Duos and Squads would be something similar but with different points given.

# A BALANCED SYSTEM THAT REWARDS AGGRESSION BUT ALSO ALLOWS PLAYING SAFE

This system allows for different strategies instead of the good old farming/camping until the final circles. The game flow would change as getting kills is as important as placements.

Also, since you loose 6 points if you die on the first 25 placements, hot dropping won't be effective.

# ITEMS/GAMEPLAY CHANGES FOR COMPETITIVE ONLY

* Explosive items are limited to RPG &amp; grenade launcher.
* Mobility needs to be reviewed but I honestly think it's fine as it is in normal. Only planes need to be nerfed.
* Maybe Grappler needs some tweeks.
* Bounce pad and impulse are back.
* No turrets
* \+50 HP/Shield on kill
* \+100/50/50 wood/brick/metal on kill

   * I, II, III
* Mythic League  

   * Points systems: starts at 50 points. Demotion when getting to 0.

# REWARDS

At the end of each season each player gets a unique reward (skins/emotes/etc.) for their rank. All items are special and only available at the end of each season. Never to be available on the shop. ( [u/Claaaayster](https://www.reddit.com/u/Claaaayster) )

# LIMITED TIME MODE: King of The Hill

**Summary**  
The battle for the throne has begun. four teams fight to stake claim over the hill. Be watchful, the hill will relocate randomly throughout the match! Be King of the hill for long enough to win the match. Do you have what it takes to be the King of the island?

## Mode Details

* The location of the first hill will randomly locate on the map. The hill will then randomly relocate every five minutes within the storm circle (up to a maximum of 3 times)
* Players will respawn after 7 seconds when eliminated, keeping their inventory. 
* Increased resources from farming (unsure how much but more than normal)
* 25 players per team (total of 4 teams)
* Teams should take the time to farm and gather weapons prior to the first hill being activated.
* The more teammates on the hill the faster it will be captured. Be careful though, if any enemies remain on the hill, it cannot be claimed!
* Only uncommon weapons and higher spawn in this mode.
* The first team to gain 100 points wins!",FortNiteBR

I have made an observation that might be enlightening to some people concerning the eggs. When you look closely at the eggs you can see a shadow and hear a heartbeat, but the shadows have no evidence of wings, legs, or arms so i have a theory that instead of the eggs hatching into dragons, they hatch into wyrms... for those who do not know what wyrms are a type of dragon that commonly appears in British and Norse mythology. These dragons have no legs or arms and only the long, scaled body of a serpent. So technically they can still be called dragons but its still very different from traditional dragon styles that you see most of the time. In mythology wyrms tend to live inside of mountains protecting treasure which would make sense considering the dungeon can be accessed by a cave hole on the back side of the mountain near the frozen Greasy Grove and that cave is connected to a castle which would make sense if there is treasure at the bottom near the eggs. You also can't forget that when you enter the dungeon the normal way through the entrance of the castle you can see stairs going down, currently still melting ice, near where the chests usually spawn on the podiums.",FortNiteBR

I'm looking back to when not only myself, but a lot of people I notice in the community, seemed to have peak enjoyment with the game and the general consensous tends to be season 3. 

Now what was so great about that particular season? It's quite possible that it was because the game was relatively new and that's the season where it's popularity began to boom so honestly the answer could just simply be nostalgia. 

Another factor I'm at least giving thought to is the map itself. While it's true that the current map is the largest map with the most interactivity we've ever experienced (ziplines, planes, quads, etc), is it possible that it's TOO cluttered? 

One thing I've come to realize in hindsight is I loved how clean and simple the map was back in S3. Yeah it lacked environmental diversity but everything was just simple and straight forward. No vehicles, no ziplines. 

Just drop, loot, run, survive. 

As the game has evolved over time, there have been so many new elements added that the core feeling of the game has changed dramatically as well. 

My biggest question for this community is this: Has the game evolved TOO much? Is the map TOO cluttered? Would you find the game more entertaining had we gone back to a more simplified, base game? 

Would the community benefit with a classic mode like Halo did with an older map and mechanics?

Again, not trying to spark an arguement, I just want healthy discourse. ",FortNiteBR

Early game is just sad to watch how people who found good loot massacre the players who didn't have the same luck. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to be a fornite pro player to lose so much money because he happened to find the worst loot for the situation while his nearest enemy found the ideal one. 

Personally, I could suggest the implementation of the following:

* A **competitive game mode** where players can AT LEAST choose 2 or 3 weapons to start the match with (even if they are grey/green/blue). Maybe keep utility items in chest if you really have to, but give players the ability to survive early game through skill, not through luck. Also remove airplanes, balloons and mounted turrets.
* A **rank-based matchmaking system.** This is a change needed for both vets and new players. As a vet there is no satisfaction winning a game where out of 15 kills only 1 or 2 (if u are lucky) players put up an actual fight. It gives me more satisfaction to lose a good and intense fight rather than winning one against someone that barely knows how to edit a window. And I can imagine that being massacred by a good players is not fun either for a newbie. This will also help with players dying too fast because a rank will give them a reason to give their best and play safer. Right now i have games where the first circle didn't even closed and there were only 15 players left.

New, old and pro players, all of them would be happier if epic implemented some competitive elements.

Do you guys think that will Fortnite go towards a more competitive direction or will it continue to be the eSports' meme?",FortNiteBR

Personally I think that planes ruin the core game play mechanics of Fortnite and generally create an unfun environment. Even with the nerfs to the turret and damage taken the core issues still exist. You shouldn't be able to ram a plane into someones structures completely destroying it while raining down on them with a turret. The nerf to the turret was very minor as you can still consistently get 3-4 shots on someone before you jump out and fight them. Since planes have been added third partying has increased drastically, I know this is a battle royale and third partying is in it by nature however planes just add fuel to the fire by allowing players to dive bomb onto already weakened targets getting free kills the majority of the time. Perhaps add a playlist which doesn't have planes and is more of a ranked/classic take on Fortnite which focuses more on building (no boomboxes, less explosives etc).

Currently the pumps hit for 95/100/105/110 with a 2.0X headshot multiplier this is way too strong to the body and does not reward headshots as much as it should. 

This also makes the green pump useless. There is not another gun that one tier of it has a huge fundamental difference between the other tiers (not being able to one pump to the head) 

I think the perfect solution to both of these problem would be to change the base damage to 80/85/90/95 with a 2.5 multiplier to the head. 

With this change the pumps would still be strong but actually reward headshots and aim. 

This would also make the green pump hit for an even 200 to the head making it just as viable as the other pumps.

# Points System

* **Placements:** \&gt; Top 25  

   * 25*th - 21st:* 1 point
   * 20*th - 16th:* 2 points
   * *15th - 11th:* 3 points
   * *10th - 6th:* 4 points
   * *5th - 4th:* 5 points
   * *3rd - 2nd:* 6 points
   * *1st:* 8 points
* **Kills:** 2 Points per kill
* **Assists:** 75+ dmg to a player counts as an assists if he dies in the next minute: 1 Point per assist
* **Getting Killed** 
   * 100th-76th: -6 points
   * 75th-41st: -4 points
   * 40th-16th: -2 points

Losing points would actually make the system viable. Otherwise it's impossible to categorise and divide players by elo as your elo would be forever growing.

Duos and Squads would be something similar but with different points given.

&amp;#x200B;

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

# A BALANCED SYSTEM THAT REWARDS AGGRESSION BUT ALSO ALLOWS PLAYING SAFE

This system allows for different strategies instead of the good old farming/camping until the final circles. The game flow would change as getting kills is as important as placements.

Also, since you loose 6 points if you die on the first 25 placements, hot dropping won't be effective.

&amp;#x200B;

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

# ITEMS/GAMEPLAY CHANGES FOR COMPETITIVE ONLY

* Explosive items are limited to RPG &amp; grenade launcher.
* Mobility needs to be reviewed but I honestly think it's fine as it is in normal. Only planes need to be nerfed.
* Maybe Grappler needs some tweeks.
* Bounce pad and impulse are back.
* No turrets
* \+50 HP/Shield on kill
* \+100/50/50 wood/brick/metal on kill

&amp;#x200B;

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

# RANKS

**You get demoted to a lower league when you get to 0 points. You get promoted to a new league when getting to 100(or more?) points.**

* Wood  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Brick  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Metal  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Silver  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Gold  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Epic  

   * I, II, III, IV, V
* Legendary  

   * I, II, III
* Mythic League  

   * Points systems: starts at 50 points. Demotion when getting to 0.

&amp;#x200B;

# REWARDS

At the end of each season each player gets a unique reward (skins/emotes/etc.) for their rank. All items are special and only available at the end of each season. Never to be available on the shop.

First of all: when i\`m with my friends playing and the one which is using ""yellow"" (the last one) is pinning to jump off somewhere in desert area, we have a hard time spotting the pin.

Second of all: the ""orange"" one and ""yellow"" one looks exactly the same when you\`re in a rush. For example you have 2 teams one NE and the other one SW and your orange friend says that you should rush the NE  and yellow friend say that you should rush the SW, they both use quick pin command and you end up being separated from each other.

But what scared me the most was the last noise I heard before I woke up. 4 distinct noises actually, all gradually going from soft to pronounced very fast. I recognized the sound as I looked to the sky to see multiple people gliding down ontop of me. At the very end the sound was deafening and I’m pretty sure that’s what jarred me awake. When I woke up in a cold sweat I decided to write this post, thanks for the fortnitemare irl I guess lol ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is a skill based game and the devs are trying to change this for some reason. It doesn’t take skill to chuck down a boom box and destroy a building in 5 seconds or less. I think they need to stop nerfing building and just accept the fact the Fortnite is skill based. A player that can build very fast shouldn’t be on the same level as a default skin with a boom box. RNG games are meant to be skill-based.",FortNiteBR

However, it made me wonder if im just missing something or if other people have had similar experiences?


The post was talking about along the lines of how 'there are no sweats - just people who are willing to practice more than you to be better, so stop complaining.'


For context - I've played since day one. I've played some 3000 odd games. I only have 200 odd wins. I play duos for the vaaaaast majority of the time, and my friend has only played slightly less than me. I have never stuck to a single game so much and for so long and put in so many hours into....anything really, in my whole life. My playstation activity report last year says I spend something like 700 hours on PS4. (I also spent a fair amount of time on pc early on and got nearly 100 of my wins in the first 3 months of the game launch in squads, when everyone sucked.


I did practice (way back before playground) in the North end of wailing (for mats and peace) until the storm came, showing my friend how to 90 and Wal ramp rush, how to edit, and all the rest. We then practiced a tonne in playgrounds. We practice in creative now. We use aim training courses from selage and grexy (or something) as recommended by gronky.

We could hold our own (ish) some nights and get a win or two. (We only played from about 9 till 12pm at night, 4 or 5 nights a week because that is absolutely every spare second we have). I haven't played another game in the last year really of note. Even up until about 4 weeks ago, we got 3 wins in a night a couple nights in a row. We were genuinely getting better as best and quickly as we could.

But then....the soccer skin apocalypse happened. I don't know how, or why, but matches suddenly became FILLED with soccer skin's two weeks from the end of season 7. Out of the blue, they were all just....there. and we have been UTTERLLY and COMPLETELY smashed, bamboozled, wrecked, steamrolled, abused, sweated on, in every game in the last month.

It's like a switch happened. If your good, maybe you didn't notice. But even if you are, I still think you noticed, because every end game I've been in for a month is like a scrim now where even soccer skin's and people with 11+ kills are cautious and build 1x1s and we end up with 4 5 or 6 teams moving and building with the storm as it never stops at the end ( if you get there). The soccer skin's have waned somewhat, but the people are still the same.

It's like the bottom and middle of the skill gap have just....dropped out, peaced out, given up, whatever. They just aren't there. I expect it's because they've given up in normal play modes, and just stick to playgrounds, creative, team rumble or in all likelihood, Apex. They are Trying to get in on the ground level whilst every one is the same, learning the game and not a million miles ahead of you.

I honestly think that's a massive part of why apex has got such massive numbers so quickly. Disenfranchised fortunate players, desperately looking for something to replace the fun that this game used to be, in a new, simpler, free to play game.


And now we have the treasure maps. On face value, it seems like a great idea huh? Easy to find gold weapons for anyone....except, the people who are likley to find them, and get peace to retrieve them are the less skills or less brave people who will land at the edge of the map get lucky, get a map and get 3 or 4 golden guns. only to be steamrolled as usual by some monster in thier first engagement. Now all that seems to have done, is bring a tonne more accurate and damaging firepower, and give it to all the crazy players making them even *MORE* dominant than before.

I feel like epic is trying to go in an entirely different direction, and just embrace the game as a super high skill ceiling game, giving people in normal playlists all the things that helps really good players - removed grenades, boom boxes, bottle rockets, planes, c4, (dont get me wrong, most people hated that nonsense lol) as well as giving more mats per time spent harvesting, and health and shield on successful kills (+more mats again). it feels like everything about fortnite in the last month or so has been heavily favoring the super skilled higher tier players, whereas in previous season, it was trying its best to restrict and limit building, and make shooting easier (spray meta) lowering building mats, making it easier to break etc. To be clear - im not advocating for that to come back, or that was better, I'm just saying what i have seen so far.

I'm not saying one way is better than the other, and we have had about 6-8 months of epic trying to reign in the skill ceiling, so its understandable if theyre trying to go in another direction, but i feel like its leaving a lot of the player base just, unable to enjoy the game. Kids use playgrounds and creative, sweats (or let's drop the perjoratives and say higher skilled players) use tournaments and cups,but when they're not on, they just fill main playlists and make it super hard for anyone that's not super top tier to have any success at all.

Am i imagining this or does anyone else feel like the game is steering away hard from the main part of its audience?


I'm open to any and all kind of answers - not just people who agree with me, but if you don't, can you try to explain why, so I can hopefully understand it from someone else's perspective (because I, having never been a top tier player, or competitive person, can't relate to that way of thinking or preferences), but i AM willing to listen and hopefully learn.

Should you force  players to adapt to a play style that doesn’t fit their personality at all? 

Pros claim that “w-keyers” are stupid and bad at the game. But what the really is skill?

lately I've recognize myself having less and less fun in this game. It feels like every round is full of people that use every possibility to get an advantage and if you don't keep up with these you just facerolled.

Some examples:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Mastering Edits

\- Mousewheeledits

\- Stretched Resolution

etc.

I mean it is a great achievement, if you're 90s are fast af but I just feel like its an unfair advantage. If I'm a blue belt, I don't fight with black belts right? Can we atleast have a permanent ranked system that matches us against other blue belts then?

It was like a Season 3 v2, and people treat it like it’s so different because of like one major map change.

I’ve also seen an uprising in Season 3 players claiming to be “OG”, when it’s literally the 3rd season of the game! It’s anything but original, and was the most overhyped and popular season (I joined early season 3, and I didn’t know the game existed previously- which goes to show how popular it was). People keep using this “OG” status thing to shit on later seasons because they’re not original or old, and that’s such a delusional way of thinking.

Season 4 was the season I had the most fun with, and it was my 2nd season of being a newbie player. I learned double pump, learned how to build, and the overall vibe was awesome. I will forever and always love it for it’s gameplay and storyline, even if it isn’t “OG” by your standards. I’d love it if we could just drop the whole OG thing and just appreciate the season for what it is.

Instead of challenging me, it was driving me away from playing the normal modes because it was more discouraging than to practice.

In the current meta there are no ways to avoid fights (like planes), and fast building + pump headshots are the main skills. On controller especially it’s actually quite mechanically difficult to be great at building (eg editing a window, pumping someone in the head, then closing it up).  If you watch a streamer in the final circle of a scrim the level of building is kinda too fast to even comprehend as a viewer.

I used to like fortnite because even players who weren’t the best could win sometimes with sneaky strategies but this is no longer the case. The game is now like a survival horror for me because basically everyone is good and will outbuild and kill me, I don’t mind losing games but losing basically every fight is not fun.

First of all, those skins aren’t meant to be “OG”. Every skin is meant to be a cosmetic. Whether it’s fun, cool weird, etc. They’re not meant to show skill level. And thankfully, Epic didn’t make OG variants for Merry Marauder, Ginger Gunner, Crackshot, or the Soccer Skins. The skins aren’t meant to show skill level.

Players will always go for the strongest, easiest, most reliable weapons. The infantry rifle is harder to use, so you pick it up, play badly, and then complain about the gun. But the gun was never the problem. It was your lack of skill. You don't have the skill to use the infantry rifle to it's full potential, and it's worse than the regular AR for you.. and that's ok.

&amp;#x200B;

Weapons changes: 

Vault infantry rifle, 

Vault or change supressed and normal pistols,

Vault turrets

Vault clingers

Vault bottle rockets

Increase damage of tactical shotgun by 2 dmg,(from 67 to 69 for the grey and 70 to 72 for the green one) and for the blue one by 1 dmg(from 74 to 75). This would make a it a more viable option for those who don't run smg and also diversify a little bit the loadouts.

Add back the heavy shotgun, reduce the damage drop off a little bit and increase body to 80 so a full headshot would one pump

Reduce bodyshot damage of snipers,

Give the hunting rifle a small window of opportunity where the bloom isn't as extrem (for ex. at the peak of the jump). Or change/vault.

Change rpg to have a damage radius dropoff (center deals more damage than outskirt), 

Make traps deal less damage or damage over time,

Reduce chug chugs drinking time.

Reduce bloom for dual pistols, increase damage drop off

&amp;#x200B;

Quality of life changes: 

Change edit mechanic, optional; for example press and hold edit key, then edit, release. Or same but without mouse left click for choosing the edit. The second option would make editing so much faster and smoother, especially for higher ping players.

Add a instant reset key. This would greatly benefit console player but also PC players who don't want to use scroll wheel for reset.

Make Ghost hit register. Its extremly annoying if you deal one or multiple ones, in particular full headshot pumps.

Increase the loot variety. I dont think many want grey tac in it's current state, grey pistols in it's current state or grey infaltry off spawn. 

Remove slow redeploy bug.

Remove these random lag spikes (don't know if they still exist)

If I have high ground, and I’m not even actively fighting the person below me, the *fair* counter should be for me to take fall damage if they destroy my structure. 

When this happens, it’s usually not a big deal. But if an engagement gets dragged out because a player is repeating the cycle with their redeploy, it creates a lot of room for 3rd partying. Why should the person that I’m fighting be bailed out by glider redeploy *and* a 3rd party?

A turbo build ""overheat function""- This would not allow players to just hold down turbo build for extended periods of time

An item that either allows you to take control of enemies walls, or a throw able item that would essentially trap you enemy in a 1 by 1 box

Yeah it wasnt always the best, but it was definitely a fun gun to use most of the time. At this point i am beginning to just get tired of the normal ar, and while i do somewhat like the IR, i still feel it needs some more balance, so here are my ideas on how to bring it back.

Ultimately, if i were adding them back, i would say that all three shots need to be more accurate then before for both versions, i think 18 shots per mag (6 bursts) for both as well, and reload time should be the same as well. If i don't mention it specifically in each option, just assume they are to be the same. 

 Option A would be to have a smaller delay between burst, giving it a rapid fire rate, with less damage then it use to have. This way while it is accurate, it isnt broken to use. Option b would be a longer delay, making it slower, but about the same damage as before with good accuracy, thinking the delay would be something close to the pumps delay between shots.

Well, tell me what you guys think down below, would you prefer A or B, would you rather see it just return the way it was, or do you have your own method of bringing it back? Hope you have a good day.

(Not ""Vault it."")","It looks like the IR is going to be around for a while, since other than tweaking the drop rate down a small amount, they're going to be found all around so far in S8.

In some ways, this is the heavy assault rifles scrawnier older brother- 8 rounds before reload vs. 25 for the HAR means that despite similar damage scaling, the IR can't sustain it's rate of fire and the need to basically reload twice to put the same number of bullets downrange. Despite using a bigger cartridge (if you're comparing the Garand to the Zastava each one's modeled on), it deals marginally less damage on top of it's limited fire capacity and the need to deal with a projectile that needs a bit of leading vs. the usual AR hitscan.

That being said, it wouldn't take too much to make the IR more appealing. Here's what I'd suggest.

1) Bump the damage per round up to 50/52/54 for the grey/green/blue versions. This gives it the capacity to one-shot an unshielded target if headshot (2x headshot damage), but again it's got a seriously limited number of shots before reloading.

2) Add a scoped (not thermal) infantry rifle for a purple/gold version with 52/54 damage. This hybridizes nicely with scoped/thermal ARs, giving it a punch between true sniper rifles and those, but with a lower number of shots and pain delivered than the old semi-auto sniper (appropriate, since it uses medium bullets).",FortNiteBR

Trust me I know how to have a build-fight. However these guys get 6 floors up faster than I can get up 3 floors by running up a ramp. These guys also never miss their shots. It's Always a headshot and usually I barely leave an opening for them to shoot me.

Also, if anyone wants to comment, or suggest anything I may have missed, or even just give your own opinion, then feel free!

Season 8 dropped on Thursday, and I have to say that out of all the major changes to the map, this has to be my favourite. The volcano looks awesome from any perspective on the map, and the pirate/adventure theme is pretty decent. Although I do enjoy the new area in the game, I can’t help but feel that familiar sense of nostalgia when it comes to the game now.

I’m aware of the many posts and videos in the sub, and on platforms like YouTube, that point to the nostalgic feeling that a significant percentage of the community is feeling, but I’ve never seen anybody analyze the changes made. What I tend to see is disgruntled people having a b\*tch in the comments section of a Facebook post, or on this sub.

Basically this post is to highlight my opinions (which are probably shared by a lot of people) on changes made throughout the seasons. I’ve broken everything down into subcategories as there’s quite a bit I have to write.

**Music**

Music is the first thing I want to talk about because it’s the thing I remember most about my first time playing the game. I’d loaded the game up after some friends told me I “had to download it now, and play”, and I’ll never forget hearing the OG menu music for the first time. It was cool but eerie, and I sat there for a good couple of minutes to listen to it.

The OG music fit the mood of the game perfectly. Just like the music, the game-play was cool, but also had that ghostly feel to it. It almost made you feel anxious that something was always about to happen. The music was dark, but it also had an uplifting element to it which was perfect, especially after getting a Victory Royale.

When they changed it, it almost instantly killed the vibe of the game. It went from the strange but cool feeling to a happy sounding adventure. I know that a lot of people were thrown by this change and didn’t really understand it. More to the point, Epic never really commented on why they just decided to change the music, when the music was already perfect.

I know that a remixed version of the OG music was released in Season 6, but it really isn’t the same. The thing is, I wasn’t against the current music being in the game, however I think a simple option could’ve been added into the settings as I know there were just as many people who enjoyed the new music just as much as the old. I’d still love to hear why the devs decided to change the music.

**UI**

Season 8 saw probably the most dramatic change to the UI. It looks completely different, especially the challenges menu. Call me boring, but I preferred the old lobby UI, and lobby in general. What I liked about it was how it was plain looking, but for events they added extra stuff (Halloween, Christmas etc.). The new style to the lobby (lobby set in a specific/new location of the map) isn’t bad though, and it’s not something that interferes with game-play. It’s just something I’m picky about.

**Battle Pass**

Apart from season 5, I’ve had all battle passes since season 3, and what I’ve noticed over the seasons is that it seems less and less effort is put into the battle pass. There used to be skins, emotes, and dances that you needed to have. Now I look through and the majority of the stuff I know I couldn’t give a sh\*t about. Including most, if not all the skins. I think this ties into how Epic handled skins, emotes, and dances, which is a topic I want to cover as well.

**Challenges**

Challenges are something I enjoy doing because I don’t have the time to grind to tier 100. I loved doing daily challenges, so when extra challenges were added to battle pass I was pretty intrigued. I think because they were simple but tough, (in the sense that the specific challenge was simple \[e.g Eliminations at Pleasant Park 0/3, or Search Chests at Greasy Grove 0/7\], but actually doing them could be tough) it worked. Now, some challenges require you to play multiple games, and search all over the map doing pointless sh\*t. It leaves me feeling like I’m ignoring the main focus of the game, which is to eliminate players, and get that Victory Royale.

**Skins/Emotes/Dances**

One of the biggest problems I have with this game at the minute is the amount of skins, dances, and emotes being pumped into it. I understand that ultimately, Epic is a business, they’ve released this game free, and need a way to keep up a profit. However, every time a new skin is released, I sigh and think to myself “oh there’s another pointless skin/dance to add to the hundreds of pointless skins and dances we have”. Skins now look like zero thought has been put into them when designing them. Same with dances. There’s a lot of dances that just look the same now. I remember when new skins were rarely released, and they’d cycle the already decent amount of skins that they had to offer. You could name skins as soon as you saw them, and recognize dances instantly. If you saw a John Wick or a Black Knight in the distance, you’d run the opposite way.  I know skins and dances are cosmetic, and provide no advantage when used in game, but I feel skins especially were a good way of judging how good another player was. There’s too many to even think about now.

**Game-play - Controls**

Not much to say about control settings really. Controls depend entirely on the person. I have to praise Epic for improving building controls for console players, and keeping the aim assist. It could use some work in close battles against squads though, as a number of times I’ve locked onto a player that I wasn’t initially fighting.

**Game-play - HUD**

Similarly to the UI, they’ve made unnecessary changes to the HUD as of Season 8. The player and way-point reticles were fine as they were. One addition I did appreciate was the beacons that were added when a teammate placed a way-point.

**Game-play - Sounds**

Right, another big one for me is the sound changes as of Season 8. I have no idea why the sounds for the Regular AR, Pump Shotgun, SMG, Rocket Launcher, and Gliders have changed for the new season. They sound too polished, and there was honestly nothing wrong with them in the first place. I noticed also that shield damage, way-point placement, and the notification sound when a teammate is downed/eliminated has changed. Again, unnecessary changes.

Supply drops used to sound like thunder (in all honesty when I first started playing the game, and I heard the notification noise for a supply drop, followed by the rumble, I thought it was just a reminder that the storm was about to close in).

I agree that player location sound has improved a lot now. It’s easier to distinguish between teammates and enemies, and the location of them.

**Game-play - Visuals**

Not much to say on visuals. I think the old storm looked better than the current one, and I’ve noticed that the colours for the ground, weapons, and sky all look more saturated. It looks fresh I guess, but didn’t have a problem with visuals since I started playing.

**Game-play - Map**

Another big topic among the community. The current map has come a long way from where we started, and honestly I like the ideas that Epic have put into the game. The different areas just shows how much the devs are capable of when it comes to designing new areas for players. However, they have sacrificed some iconic places in doing so. Anarchy Acres, Flush Factory, Greasy Grove, Loot Lake, Moisty Mire (and The Prison), Tomato Town, and Wailing Woods (which kinda sucked after the maze was taken out anyway) are all gone. Not to mention areas that weren’t named, but still popular, like the clusters of houses dotted around the map, and the shipping containers.

Eventually I think the map will have so little original places, that it’ll be pretty much unrecognizable. I think epic should have experimented with new maps, like other BR games have done successfully. A desert map, snowy map, and tropical adventure map would have all been insane as we’d have had the choice of new maps, and we would’ve still had the old map to play with.

Populating the map doesn’t really help newcomers, or casuals. A lot of players adopted a reserved game style, which meant landing at a pair of houses at the edge of the map, and working their way in. I feel like the more stuff is added, the more it's tailored for hardcore players who like to jump into populated areas to clean up.

I find it mad how places like Pleasant Park and Retail Row were the hot spots to go, and now they’re practically deserted.

**Game-play - Weapons**

Seeing new weapons in the game is alright, but I can instantly tell when I’m not going to even bother using something. And to be honest, new weapons are put forward frequently now. It’s almost as bad as the Skins! We used to have to wait a good couple of weeks before anything new was released.

As for weapons that have been vaulted, I seriously don’t know what the devs were thinking. Core weapons that have been in from the start should never have been vaulted (Bolt Action Sniper, Semi Auto Sniper, Burst Rifles, Grenades etc.). I understand that some weapons when released were really OP, but the core weapons in the game were spot on. I think a system where the core weapons are in the game all the time, with variants added for a limited time would work.

**Game-play - General**

A couple of points I think are needed to be said about the game-play in general:

* Ranks for players - “Get gud” and “Just build” are ridiculous things to say to this. Not everyone has the time to smash it. At least with a ranked mode, you can face people that are around the same difficulty as you, and get some kills instead of just being dominated.
* Luck of the drop/storm - This relates to vehicles and transport. The game was better when you had to hope that the circle would be near you based on where you chose to land. The map is not big at all, and you can make it into the circle on foot if you're on the opposite side of the map to it. If you built a 1x1 and ended up still in the circle you were lucky (which is a big factor in BR games). Thankfully a lot of transport options were taken out that could counter this easily (f\*cking planes). Zip lines suck. The introduction of rifts was the “oh sh\*t” moment that suggested that the game was going to be a lot different.
* Material nerf - Speaks for itself. It’s a BR game where you have to rely on some kind of building, whether it’s building Disney Land, or a cosy little 1x1. Why restrict mats to 500?
* Health/Shields from kills - Again, I don’t really get it. If you were lucky/smart enough to carry meds and shields then bravo to you. I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea, just that it should be in a LTM type playlist.
* Final Circles - Don’t understand why the final circles were changed so that they could be in the storm.
* Supply Drop Markers - Again, another thing that takes away the luck factor of the game. Supply drops don’t need markers on the map. It works in games like rumble because rumble is a game mode there mess around in. The amount of times in the past week I’ve been ambushed when opening a drop is ridiculous now.
* Changing Standard Modes - Things like Zombies should be in a separate playlist to standard mode. Epic say that the reason they’re putting zombies in is to encourage people to buy STW, but have also mentioned plenty of times that STW is going to be free soon. Makes no sense. Do what you did with the Sword, make it a separate LTM.
* Story - I feel like a lot more effort went into the little story behind the game after the missile launch. The meteor was by far the best (the TV’s on warning mode, the small meteors coming down etc.), but after the missile it’s as if they ran out of ideas, and just threw in mad things to f\*ck with the map.

Fortunately for you, the reader, that pretty much concludes what I have to say about the game in its current state. I do still play it, and will probably still play it for a decent amount of time, but I can feel myself getting sick of things with the game. I know I’m not the only person out there who feels this way about the game, and the only reason I took the time out to write this post is because I enjoy playing the game and don’t want to not play it. You know it’s kinda gone south when some of the biggest streamers famous for playing the game have expressed negative feelings towards the game.

Epic devs, simple is better.

TL;DR

Epic devs have made a LOT of changes to the game, a lot of them which I, and a lot of other players, find completely unnecessary. Please give us a bit of the old Fortnite back.",FortNiteBR

I wondered if the speed of the bus in-game was matching the speed it should go, measuring the doppler effect we can hear when we are dropped off the bus.

I first started to calculate the speed of the bus using the doppler effect. I used audacity to measure the frequency of the harmonic ranges [when the bus is approaching](https://imgur.com/Qe7xYtT) and [when the bus is receding](https://imgur.com/x3IKTPX). I wrote it on [this sheet](https://imgur.com/kvEW7VQ) (speed calculated assuming the speed of sound was 340 m/s).

This gives us an average speed of **351 km/h**.

Then, I launched the game to find out at what speed the bus was going.

Every square of the grid on the map is 250m*250m. Using this scale, I used [screenshots](https://imgur.com/OtHdGEp) I took in-game with a 32,58 seconds interval to find out that the bus was going **269 km/h** in-game.

That's quite far from the 351 km/h given by the result using the doppler effect.

Thank you for reading and sorry for the bad English.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is becoming boring and is infested with bugs after updates.,"Why do Epic Games keep bringing out weekly updates introducing new underwhelming shitty items at the cost of potential new bugs AND old bugs coming into the game? Is it really worth it? I just played a solo match and did surprisingly better than usual but the fun was taken away from me when my game started LAGGING despite my ping showing ""60"". I usually play on PS4 so as you know, FPS is out of my control. We can't even get FOV sliders in FPS games never mind any dramatic frame rate changing graphical options lol. Also today after the update I kept hearing the sound of somebody gliding above me but when I looked up there was nobody in the air. This sound went on for about a minute and then suddenly stopped. This is an old bug that was introduced with the glider redeploy mechanic back in season 6 and has since been taken out of the game but has still managed to find its way back in SEVERAL times after updates. Since around season 5 I have been becoming more and more distant from this game and I really can't see myself playing it for much longer. It's no surprise to me that only 5 of the 16 friends I made within Fortnite and regularly played with during season 4 still play this game but not for half as much time as they used to.

This seasons has been constant frustration as you shokt with the AR hit for 150 and people turtle with the new turbo building until I’m completely out of ammo/ need to reload or the most likely case I get third partied. I feel like there should maybe be a builder fatigue like jumping where walls take longer to build the longer it takes. Maybe after 10-15 pieces straight it takes longer.

Except all we got was...a mildly interesting set of POI’s that are just ok. No new vehicles, mechanics (zip lines s7, floating island s6) or weapons. 

Is it really out of the question to ask for a new map already? We’ve had this one for a year and a half now. Yes the POI’s are updated and whatnot but at the end of the day it is still the same level basic geometry and landmarks we know. A new map would really inject some freshness back into this game

In order to make a full wall again, I will need to go to each of the gray tiles to make a full wall and reverse the edit. For this I will need to bring my crosshair on each of the tiles.

But sometimes I see players reversing an edit without physically bringing their crosshairs to the tiles. 
I'm NOT talking about MOBILE, I'm taking about CONSOLE.

I was wondering if this was a console only feature and on top of that a PS4 one, because of the TouchPad.

What I wanted to ask that is there a way on other consoles, PC and mobile to reverse an edit without physically bringing your crosshair to each of the tiles.

Especially mobile cuz I play on mobile. It totally consumes my time when I make an edit and need to reverse it. It is fine with floors because of small edits but when I edit walls, it gets really time consuming.

Early game. Hot drop. Pick up a gun. Get a kill. Still have 4 open slots. Spam square to gather their mats and whatever gun they had. Doing this drops the gun that you already had.

I dunno man, I love the game and have never been one to complain... but I find myself on reddit for the 3rd time this season reporting a bug. I had previously never come on here because most of the bugs I could tolerate. The ones this season (sprinting, this, and a delayed build/combat mode switch) are really hindering and aggravating.

I decided I wanted to know what my group of friends who’ve played since S2 have to say about the game, and what caused them to uninstall or stop playing. (wall of text incoming, if you don’t want to read then don’t read)

Friend one said that the games weapons really don’t make sense, such as one pumping with full shield, and says the game is just a sweatfest at this point. Friend two just says the game is in a horrible sweatfest at the moment, which is why he’s taking a break until epic does something. 

Friend three also simply said the game was getting too competitive and sweaty, and they Unvaulted many items unnecessarily, and started adding items the game didn’t need. 

Friend four said the game reached peak performance at Season 3, guns felt good, the only problem was double pump. The skillgap didn’t exist at all, which is what made the game enjoyable to him. Season 4 is when he said it started to go downhill, the devs started nerfing everything and started focusing on the competitive scene for money. Then after season 5 they started to remove stuff for no reason, such as impulses, and started making stupidly overpowered guns and items. Then he said that’s when they started listening to streamers, they complain about one thing, boom gone, and ignored anyone else. 

Friend five went on a full rant, he said the game was too formulaic; land, get shit loot, axe fuck materials, go to circle, die to some sweaty kid, F. He then said the game was starting to get way to competitive for a casual game, sweats were slowly taking over. He really didn’t like the RNG aspect of the game too, it’s more luck based than having skill. He concluded the game basically got “Undertaled”, aka getting ruined by the community. 

From what I can conclude from my group of friends, their main issues with the game were the sweatfest and the unnecessary changes to the game, and that’s what made them quit. ",FortNiteBR

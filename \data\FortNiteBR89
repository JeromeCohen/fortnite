This is an attempt to be constructive criticism of the Driftin' LTM. Again, not a complaint. I appreciate that Epic is trying new things, when you do that some will be winners and some will not. 

That said, the Driftin' LTM, imho, is not. There will be those that disagree, but this is first and foremost a mobility LTM. I die to the storm more often than dying to other players. It's also FAR more RNG dependent, I've played several matches where there simply was no drop and I wasn't able to get weapons or a board.

There are also lots of bugs in this mode, from the board and its rider getting flung waaay off the map, to there being chests in Loot Lake and a few other spots. 

Players that are too far away from you lag. You see them warp backwards and forwards because they're moving too fast and you're too far away from them for the game engine to give them priority location tracking. Sometimes you see this problem with planes as well, but it's even more frustrating in this mode because it's every enemy player that's far away.

Riding the boards is fun, there's no question about that. But the inability to build gives you no recourse when you're getting shot. By the time you hold down E to jump off, you're already down. 

I'm not sure what the solution is or how to re-work this mode to be better, but I'd start with fixing the bugs and the enemy location issues. I'd probably also allow builds while on the board, similar to how you can protect yourself with builds when your feet are frozen. 

But in the meantime, I sorely miss Team Rumble.",FortNiteBR

Currently most players just don’t seem to have much fun now. Casual players cant enjoy public matches anymore because of how competitive is now. Competitive players find the game boring because there’s no challenge anymore. 

Ranked mode can fix this, in fact I can 99% guarantee you it will. If Epic adds ranked mode, there will be so many more positive things added to this game than negative. Players will finally be able to queue into games with players their skill level, and this benefits both casuals and competitives, casuals don’t get clapped as hard and competitive players have a challenge. It will give a new dynamic to the game, something to strive for, other than the amount of wins your have, you can flex with your rank or anything really. It will bring many players new and old back into the game, and will keep them in the game. 

Ranked is a MUST for Season 8, it will have a positive effect on the game and will bring back the hearts of all players back to this game. Epic please, this is something you can do. ",FortNiteBR

I believe that the Oblivion skin should ALSO get it’s own set of  colors and have it’s own challenges too, this would also be a great way to bring back the Omega challenges as well. The Omega challenges were based on level, unlike ALL THE OTHER BATTLE PASSES, which are exp based! AND allowed you to do them at whatever time you want for the rest of eternity. I’m sorry if I sound a little bit salty but I personally didn’t get Omega lights, and I played the game a lot, and grinded to level 76 and was so close, but didn’t get it. Back on topic now, when Oblivion came out I thought that it would be super cool to have matching colors with Omega but it doesn’t have any lights and really bugs me. Another idea to add on to this, is to male an entire new set of challenges for Omega or Oblivion owners. I think that it should include, a banner, loading screen with Oblivion and Omega hanging out, and of course, exp. This would be a very cool implementation to the game, because many people didn’t have the time to grind out during season 4, when the game wasn’t as popular as it is today. I’m sure many people agree with this statement and if you don’t agree, tell me what’s wrong and I’ll make edits. Thanks for reading this! This is my very first post, sorry if it’s not very good (I also wrote this all on mobile)

TLDR: Omega should get new set of challenges for owners to complete and get maxed Omega cause it’s not fair that all other tier 100 challenges go on forever l, challenges would include a new Omega banner, Oblivion and Omega loading screen, and exp. ",FortNiteBR

The dragon eggs that were stolen from polar were frozen to keep them from hatching, now prisoner has them back. 

The dragon eggs will hatch and the infamous sword was meant to be a dragonslayers sword by Ice King. It's yet unknown how this will work out now that the sword is vaulted. 

The Ice king and Prisoner will both make the world shake and the map will break to pieces and leave a ton of things destroyed and to be rebuilt (hehe kevin house in Tilted)

However, this isn't enough. The Ice king and Prisoner will have a final fight at the middle, at dusty. However from S4 the comet was shot there and now the rifts will finally be used to fix the illusion in time they have done. Then the prisoner, ice king and the comet will leave with the rift and a drastic map change will happen again either returning the map back to how it was, or rebuilding from the bases of how it was left after the great battle.

TEAM RUMBLE! Yes, you get respawns, but that’s why we love playing it. Not everyone grew up playing video games!

I will do my best to look at the upsides and downsides of having a permanent respawn mode. Sorry if this is long. 

Pros: 
-When you can respawn, challenges become far easier. A certain Overtime challenge would be a bit kinder if you could respawn upon your near immediate death. 
-Respawning gives newer and younger players a chance to have fun. Originally, I was turned off by the single chance each game. The skill of your average player far exceeded mine. When they added Team Rumble, I became much more active.  This mode also led me to buying the Battlepass, completing all the weekly and loading screen challenges, and grinding to tier 80 in two weeks. 
-It's a great warmup. I've heard quite a few competitive players and streamers would play a match of Team Rumble to get themselves prepared for Solo matches or whatever. 
-It's also great for practice. It can be highly difficult to practice in a Solo match, especially when you only have one life. If you wanted to practice long range engagements, Solo makes that difficult. You need to get a gun viable for long range, live long enough to find another player at long range, THEN you can practice. With respawning, it's incredibly easy to work on what you want. 
-Respawn modes allow you to experiment. In a Solo match, you usually need a carefully planned loadout to survive. With Team Rumble, you could freely experiment. While running nothing but close range weapons might kill you in Solo, you'd be able to attempt it plenty of times in Team Rumble. 
-You can play casually in a Respawn mode. If I'm playing a Solo match, I'm paranoid about snipers or getting one pumped. In Team Rumble, I can just respawn and keep giving it my best.

Cons:
-You could argue that this would split the player base, but I disagree. Between crossplay and its humongous amount of players, there'd be almost no matchmaking problems. During Team Rumble's long stay, I don't recall anyone mentioning difficulty finding matches. Competitive players have the tournaments that Epic is putting out, battle royale players have Solo/Duos/Squads, and casual players have Team Rumble
-A single respawn mode would get boring. This is easily solved by a rotation. Team Rumble for a week, Disco Domination for the next week, Food Fight for the week after that, etc etc
-Challenges become too easy. With a free Battlepass available, I can see the problem here. However, I think the amount of people that would begin playing makes up for this. I roped in a few friends that bought cosmetics when Team Rumble was still here. 
-Players will dislike it. If a player dislikes the current respawn mode, they can wait for the next one to be rotated in. Or if they don't like the respawn modes at all, they can still play Solos. I don't think the majority of players are all going to collectively hate respawn modes. 
-It'll take away from an event's players. Again, I can see the problem. An event might get less attention with another permanent gamemode. Most events have been highly successful, regardless of what modes are currently in, though. A select few flopped horribly (cough ice zombies), but the majority still saw plenty of players. 

Again, sorry this is so long. Just wanted to really share my thoughts on this. Thanks for reading the whole thing. I'm open to further points. ",FortNiteBR

So the weirdest part is that I don’t use my pinky at all. It awkwardly sits on the left of my keyboard. I use my ring finger for CTRL and LShift. Middle finger on A and pointer on W. I use thumb strictly for spacebar. So what I noticed (which is really weird) is to use D I quickly switch my middle finger to W, which was on A and move my pointer finger to D, which was on W.
I realized this was not normal when I watched many Fortnite streamers. ALL of them (or the ones I have watched) use their pinky for ctrl and shift. And the three others for WASD. I have tried playing like this and it is just SO awkward for my hand because I have no pinky strength and my pointer finger is so used to being on W and not on D.

I can still build fast with my keybinds. But I still feel like not using my pinky really crippled my potential of getting really skilled on the WASD keys.

I do not know what to do anymore, I am on a season long lose streak and my K/D is garbage. I play for like 16 - 20 hours per week MINIMUM, and I usually drop a lot of kills. In fact, I have made a lot of friends in the pro player league discord who have over 500 wins and even they cant carry me to a win because the last people in my matches usually have 1k+ wins  and 20 kills(I check on Fortnite tracker after they win) but I feel cursed, and those friends think I must be cursed too. They all say I should have at least 100 wins with how well I play.

When I lose, I find myself screaming at my monitor and begging epic games to let me win so loudly that I lose my voice and my head starts to pound. I have chronic Ulcers so I also usually find myself coughing up small amounts of blood from the frustration and my stomach burns like hell.

A week ago I was killed by Dakotaz in the top 3, and back in season 5, I was destroyed by TSM\_Hamlinz. He was also live and when I checked his stream, his chat was calling me a bot too. I didn't even know these guys were streaming, I am just constantly in lobbies with them and its making me utterly miserable.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing keeping me around at this point is Fortnite's fairly interesting story and the small bit of hope I have left that I might be somewhat decent at the game one day. Not to mention the fact that there is NOTHING else to play right now. I am just really looking forward to Hytale for some frustration free online fun in the future.

All I ask is people just quit saying stuff about me that isn’t true, like I’m a “V-Buck Scammer” and a “Trash YouTuber.” Thanks, and once again I’m sorry. ",FortNiteBR

137,woooshmachine,1550625431,asi1it,42,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/asi1it/a_list_of_what_should_be_vaulted_things_that/,0,"A list of what should be vaulted, things that maybe can be vaulted, things that shouldn’t be vaulted, and things that should be unvaulted with Season 8.","I thought long and hard about this all day, so bear with me.

#WHAT SHOULD BE VAULTED:

*This is a list of things that are too OP or too useless to be in the game, that should be vaulted.*

•#RPGs. RPGs, despite the recent nerf, are still too powerful. They don’t have bloom or splash damage and are highly annoying to fight against. Vaulting them would require players to be more careful with what plays they make and how aggressive they play.

•#Regular pistol. Handguns (regular pistols) are not reliable early game. They have too much bloom and a small magazine. Besides, no one carries them after early game anyway. They’re useless, basically.

•#Tactical Shotguns. Do I really need to explain? Tacs are garbage. I have never seen them be used past the first 5 minutes of the game and they are highly unreliable. MAYBE they could have a little tuning to make them better before they are vaulted completely. But they’d still be garbage probably.

•#Bottle rockets. This is something I shouldn’t have to explain either. They’re useless and I’ve only seen them be used in Team Rumble. Terrible addition to the game.

•#Chiller grenades. They’re fun to use but don’t help competitively, unless you’re at the edge of the map. But most people aren’t at the edge. So it’s useless.

•#Planes. Planes are highly controversial and I think they should be vaulted. I really like the “no going thru buildings” nerf they got, but they still have a turret, which is extremely annoying to fight against. Vault them.

•#Mounted turrets. These guys are pretty much useless after the multiple nerfs they’ve gotten. I’ve only used the turret once post-nerf and that was to fight against planes. They suck. All they do is take up the loot pool.

•#Shopping carts. Unless they get a buff like you can carry extra loot in the space in the front or you can pick up a downed teammate, they should be vaulted. No one is stupid enough to take a shopping cart over a quadcrasher. I don’t know why they haven’t been vaulted yet or buffed.

•#Balloons. There is nothing worse than getting sprayed by an AR or getting rained down on with explosives by someone 50 ft up in the air with balloons. They’re annoying as hell to fight against, it’s practically impossible to fight against unless you hit a lucky sniper shot. Vault them.


#WHAT COULD MAYBE BE VAULTED:

*This is a list of things where guns/items that I don’t hate but I may not particularly like, and they have game changing or space taking negative effects to them.*

•#Boogie bombs. I find these on the ground next to chests all the time, but a lot of people find them useful. So it maybe could be vaulted because some people use them, some don’t. Personally I don’t pick them up over anything (besides bottle rockets). I don’t hate them either, I like how unique they are.

•#Hand Cannons. Deagles, after their recent nerf, are always left on the ground around chests. I personally still take them over hunting rifles and suppressed snipers because of the devastating damage they do long range, and they have FSA. They’re still useful but a lot of people disagree, so that’s why I put it under maybe.

•#Sneaky Snowmen. I don’t have an issue with sneaky snowmen, i only put it under maybe because it depends on whether or not snow will still be on the map in Season 8.

•#ATKs. ATKs are totally underused because of their speed (and the terrible boost mechanic) but at the same time they can carry an entire squad, and provide some cover. I personally never take ATKs unless absolutely necessary, but you guys tell me what you think.

•#Scoped revolvers. I actually kind of like scoped revolvers but no one uses them over a sniper. There’s nothing bad about them, they’re just underused. (Also they shouldn’t be epic/legendary, rare/epic is probably better.)

•#Heavy Assault Rifles. I personally really do like AKs but they’re a tad too powerful and a lot of people agree. Unless Epic nerfs the damage, they could be vaulted. This one I was a little iffy on.

#WHAT SHOULD NOT BE VAULTED:

*This is a list of things that should not even be considered being put in to the vault and items that should be safe from the vault.*

•#Suppressed pistols. These bad boys are completely underrated. If used correctly, they can silently devastate someone with a few *pews*.  They also do nice damage long range. Epic plz no vault them

•#Clingers. I know they were just returned from the vault, but knowing Epic they can be stupid and vault them again. Anyway, they shouldn’t be vaulted because they’re really satisfying to stick to someone and watch them accept their fate, and go *beep beep boom!*.  It was a good decision on Epic’s part to bring them back and replace grenades. 

•#Suppressed SMGs. Again, they were just returned from the vault, but Epic can be not so epic sometimes. They’re much much better than regular SMGs because of their accuracy and high damage that’s balanced out by the fire rate and damage drop off. They feel really good too.

•#Suppressed ARs. I’ve seen a lot of people complaining about their terrible accuracy and low damage. Just don’t spray it lol. It’s perfectly fine where it is.

#WHAT SHOULD BE UNVAULTED:

*Under this list you’ll find things that are currently vaulted that should be returned to the game because of how useful they can be.*

•#Smoke Grenades. These can be useful if your teammate is downed in the open and you don’t have any materials, or if you need to escape from a sticky situation. They weren’t useful back in their time but they are now with where the game is.

•#Bouncers. I don’t know how high Epic was at the time they vaulted the bouncers over the grappler. The grappler was literally way more OP than bouncers (thank god grapplers got vaulted). Bouncers did not take you up to the top of a build battle from all the way down with a few clicks. Grapple guns did. Bouncers were totally fine and very useful. Please bring them back.

•#Port A Fortresses. I was pretty shocked to hear these were vaulted. They were very useful if you had no mats, plus they had 🦀 bouncers 🦀.  They were definitely useful.

Well, that took a while. Anyway let me know what you guys think!

 I'm the guy that you shoot at and it takes him ages to understand where you're at. I'm the guy that build a single wall when you guys build a castle. I'm the guy that forget what each button do as soon as he is in combat. I'm the guy that spams 59 AR bullets and hits one. 


I'm just not good enough to enjoy the regular modes, and I'm unlikely to get much better. And no, I don't want to 'practice my building'.


But I enjoy the more casual large team modes. I prefer soaring 50 but rumble was also fun. And I do not play any other modes. And I'm sure I'm not the only one.

So, whenever epic are taking away the large team mode, there is nothing I can play. I understand why epic will never remove solo/duo/squad - they'll get tons of hate from their more influential fanbase. But they just don't seem to care that much for the less gifted players and I don't understand why.

So my point is that either soaring 50 or team rumble should become a permanent mode, ensuring that noobs also always have a game mode to play if they don't like the current ltm.

Then they can keep testing new modes like this driftin' one without leaving noobs with nothing to play (and no, shooting someone while riding a hoverboard is beyond my abilities)

But the problem with the drift LTM is that you are too focused on other things it makes gameplay impossible. You are too worried about finding supply drops and the storm that enemies aren’t even fighting. They are scrambling for the next zone. And if you do not find a supply drop in the first 3 minutes, your screwed.

This scramble for the zone is just impossible to cope with. It’s a huge mess of startled cats. Nobody fights - 8/10 deaths are to the zone. And if you’re too far from the zone initially you might as well leave the game.

TLDR the zone moves way too fast to make drift LTM playable. Supply drop scramble isn’t enjoyable. This game mode sucks.",FortNiteBR

-100 players dropping Tilted and having a pickaxe battle or just generally having 100 people dropping on 1 POI and fighting it out

-a regular game but you can only use pickaxes and throwables

-a regular game but you’re not allowed to shoot/do damage to other players, essentially have everyone survive til the end of the game and see who can win solely by healing.

Exhibit A: Fortnite has never been less popular on Twitch since sometime in Season 1.  We heard everyone say ""Just wait a couple days, Fortnite will bounce back"".  It hasn't.

Exhibit B: If you go to Google Trends, you'll see that Fortnite searches have been plummeting for the last couple of months.

Exhibit C:  All the random que players know this but ever since Respawn Entertainments game came out, it's really rare to get matched with another adult gamer.  It seems like the 18+ crowd has permanently moved to AL.

Exhibit D: The pro scene seems to be enjoying Curren Fortnite a bit due to the increased skill gap.  In a game with no SBMM, this is a death knell for the majority of players.  No one wants to get steamrolled by no life sweats in lobbies.

Exhibit E: The activity on this very subreddit is slower than it's been in over a year.  People just aren't interested in talking about Fortnite like they were 9, 6, 3 months ago.

Another issue is thirsting. I like to play duos and have hundreds of games with my duo partner and only since the most recent update has thrusting increased. No doubt it was there before but it’s increased since then

A couple ways to fix this:

An Apex style respawn system. Where for around 90 seconds you can get revived from the nearest beacon or whatever. However, the health or shield is still granted after thirst

Fighting someone in a box on PS4 pro is impossible since the game has epic shadows and motion blur. We should also be able to turn v sync off because that has input lag

We should have the option to turn these “features” off.

It would:

-Make the game more fair

-Give more stable FPS (I understand consoles can’t go over 60fps, but a constant 50-60, even 40 FPS in end games is way better than what we have now)

Thanks for ruining this for me. I was hoping to see some awesome challenges where I had to pull some sick 720 or 1080s over by Happy Hamlet or other cool things.

I just can’t believe what I’ve been experiencing in the game lately. I can’t remember the last time I came across a “bot” or “bad” player in solos. It seems as though every player I encounter is highly skilled. I understand that the game has been out for well over a year now and the average player skill has risen but has it really gotten this insane? With the alleged number of players that play this game I truly can’t believe that every player I come across is of equal or better skill than myself. I can’t help but feel SBMM is truly a thing. Perhaps my skill has just fallen behind and the only players in solos are the ones that have dedicated a lot of time to practicing.

I’m not against updating the game to keep it fresh, but it just seems odd to have so many “seasons” in one years time. 2 years from now it’s gonna be like season 23 or something 

Obviously not a big deal, but could make it hard down the line to remember your favorite season or even what was happening during a certain season.

The iPhone didn’t even want to make an iPhone 10 and just called it an iPhone X and got fancy with Roman numerals. “Now that’s what I call music” where kids sing popular songs  is in like the 69th volume at this point, but that’s been around since the 80s

Year long seasons with a preseason to test major game changes might help fortnite in the long run. It would obviously cut down on the number of battle passes epic sells, but they could just release multiple battle passes for a single season to keep the money flowing ",FortNiteBR

So what if this person, found out what was happening in the future and decided to create this permanent rift to attempt to go back in time and save it?

I don’t come here too often anymore but I know I’ve seen plenty of this kind of discussion from time to time. I figured I’d put my 2 cents in.

I played this game initially in January of 2018 because PUBG was such a mess. I remember getting my first hit markers at dusty depot and thinking “my god it’s hit scan, when I hover over them and click it does damage!”. I fell in love instantly , the art style was amazing and the battle royal scene was still pretty new-ish. From that point on I played every single day , sometimes only an hour or two but on my day off it could last almost all day.

I was watching myself improve regularly through the end of season 2. At the end of season 3 I had decent building skills and I honestly was more confident than I had been in any other multiplayer game. Then mid season 4 people started getting noticeably better and my stats and wins went down considerably by the end of the season. Then everyone that was around for season 5 knows about the spray meta , this is around the time I just couldn’t hang with most players anymore.

At the end of season 5 an expansion for a PvE game I enjoy was coming out so I pretty much took season 6 off. Maybe a game here and there, won a match in my maybe 50 games played but I noticed every fight I got into it seemed like the endgame of season 4. Anyway, season 7 dropped and I was still pretty busy with the other game until early January . 

I figured “I’ll get back into Fortnite” remembering all the fun times I had around that time last year. Boy was I wrong , it’s at the point now a days  I just can not compete . I know this is what happens to every game after it’s been out a while but the building skill gap is absolutely crazy to me now. I even went into playgrounds to practice “90s” and other tips I’d seen on YouTube, practice  editing .... I just don’t have the speed and I put more time into playgrounds than I had matches (a little over 100 solos and 50 duos). 

So after going for it for about 6 weeks I’m ready to throw in the towel. I know I can play 50 v 50 modes but there is nothing like a solo/duo win, knowing you came out on top of 99 other people. I  have had a great time, spent WAY too much money on skins (from season 2-5, I haven’t bought anything since October).  It just isn’t fun for me anymore. I can hop on regular shooters and hold my own but the building is just beyond what I’m capable. 

The best part is that’s what I initially loved about the game, the building, it made it so if you weren’t amazingly precise you could still build up or build cover and reign down shotgun blasts.  It just so happens it’s now the downfall for me since I just don’t have the time to dedicate , nor do I think I’d ever achieve the level some people are on, to compete with the end game now- a- days. 

So that’s my journey with Fortnite , now the question....What do YOU think they can do to recapture all the players in this similar situation that don’t play as much or at all because they just can’t keep up? ",FortNiteBR

Since stats were added to Switch and mobile, I can say I have 21 Solo wins, 425 top 10s and 949 top 25s in 2469 matches played, with 1748 eliminations. Also, 1 solo Squad win when I was trying to hit top 6 for a daily.

 I have no desire to play this game competitively, play scrims, or qualifiy for tournaments with money on the line. 

Having said that, I know a free for all multiplayer shooter is competitive by design, and believe me when I say I do everything I can in the time I have to play to improve. I try to work on positioning, building, gunplay and aiming. I also accept that wins won't come as easy for me as they will for some of you. 


I know I’m in the minority here, but I used to be able to sneak in a win every now and then when I waited for the top 5 to duke it out and then I got a lucky shot in for the win. Since 7.40 I try to put up a fight, get some kills, but in the end some build god with 13 kills and 200 hp just owns me every time. I know my playstyle gets frowned upon by the competitive community, but honestly it’s all I got and I liked that it was a possibility.


I have to say it makes me try to get better, but the difference between me and a good player is just to big to be honest. I try to keep up, but I don’t feel like I’m getting anywhere close to their level. I can see why people like the change but in all fairness for me it’s changed from surviving at 10 hp to surviving at 60 hp, which doesn’t change much. What has changed is I can’t one shot anyone after they get out of a fight, because they’re at 150-200 hp. It’s taking away some of the enjoyment knowing I’ll probably have to accept not winning a game anytime soon.


I hope Epic can and will consider the group of players like me when evaluating this change and maybe make it into a separate competitive mode.

Does anyone else feel this way about the addition of health and shields on kill? It seems it was mostly received very positively, but I do feel the casual playerbase is less prone to rage on Reddit, but silently suffer their fate. ",FortNiteBR

I believe I have a simple fix. As bleed out time increases, the hp gained on the elim also increases.","Having an efficient and functioning knocking mechanic is extremely important to team modes. However, It is currently redundant and essentially useless in the current meta as a result of the 7.4 update. Having the 50 hp boost on elims is great, but in team modes it should an increasing boost. Ie once the players is knocked, once thirsted only 10 hp is granted. However, after half of the bleed out time has passed, then the thirst will result in a full 50 hp. I think this will ensure the knocking mechanic is not only “in the game”, but truly doing it’s job in giving the player knocked, and or their team a chance at continuing should they come out alive. Don’t just say “dont get knocked lol”. All strong players are knocked, and this mechanic released in 7.4 is great, but makes the knocked mechanic redundant. Happy building!",FortNiteBR

Okay so in season 5 Fortnite had a big change on the map anarchy acres was replaced with lazy links and moisty mire was replaced with the desert biom, or was it?Lets go back and think about how the new desert biom came to be. The rifts brought in many things from the past and present including bones, an anchor, and even a temple. Let’s think about the durr burger appearing in the California desert and how drift and the burger got rifted into the game. What if the rift didn’t bring in a chunk of desert land, but brought in a ton of sand that covered moisty mire. If you look at the season 4 map and look at the big trees you can see that they are now where the mountains are in the desert. The trees were covered in a bunch of sand, but some of them were later cut down to build paradise palms and the race track. Tell me what you think. Thanks for reading.

As bleed out time increases, as does the amount of hp gained on the elim/thirst. Details below","The 50 hp on elims is great (added in 7.4 ie most recent patch) as it incentivizes aggressive play. An easy fix to the thirsting issue is to have it so that every 10 hp the knocked player decreases, the elim hp granted to the killer increases by 5. This way, instantly thirsting only grants 5-10 hp. In short, knocked player starts w/100 knocked hp, once this decays to 90, the thirst will grant 5 hp, 80 another 5, and so on. The rate at which killer hp is gained could be adjusted so it is 10 hp gained/ 10 hp lost, up to a maximum of 50 gained. Hope this makes sense. Before you say “just dont get knocked lol”, recall that having a “knocked down” mechanic is crucial to team modes in the BR genre. Nothing is worse than sitting through watching you team play multiple times in a row, after you have been thirsted. Thanks guys! ",FortNiteBR

Featured items for April 30th,"Hey guys, since there’s a lot of cancer content and hype regarding the future skins in the season for battle pass, I decided to do a little write up on today’s featured items in the shop

**Leviathan


*Rarity: Legendary


*Price: 2,000 Vbucks


*$20 whole American monies


*$25 Schekles


*5000 Rupees


I have no other currency to base this off of.

Regret Level: Telling the girl that you just went on the first date with that you love her and want to have kids with her. (I’ve never done that.)
~~Maybe once.~~

**Pros: 

It’s a fuckin’ fish in a bowl, man.

Named after a sweet Mastodon album
(WHITE WHALE! HOLY GRAIL!)

**Cons:

It’s literally $20...for a skin...


What are you doing with your life? Are you literally fucking Richie Rich and just feel like dropping that much on a cosmetic? ~~Don’t be an idiot like me and spend $15 on the damn Tomato skin.~~ I earned the tomato skin from StW. It’s justified... don’t judge.

The battlepass is tomorrow... that’s like 4 free skins and I’m calling it right now that the Rank 100 skin is Iron-Man. 

I won’t be like that dude who said he was gonna eat a sock or something, but I will be very disappointed in Epic if it isn’t. Hell, I might go out of my way to make a terrible tweet at them tomorrow when I find out it isn’t Iron-man, but fucking idk, Superman or something...

~~(FUCK DC!)~~

**Planetary Probe


*Type: Space Glider


*Rarity: Purple (Epic)


*Cost: 15 Hot and Spice McChicken Sandwiches or 15 Small fries.


*Regret level: Epic, I just used my last refund on that Tomato skin, PLEASE LET ME TAKE THIS BACK TOO!


Now, considering I just went on a rant about how you could get more bang for your buck with  the battle-pass, I’ll keep this short. Don’t waste your fucking money. There are more than likely better looking gliders that will come out within the next month. 

**Honorable mentions:

*Hootenanny:


I guess... but don’t really buy this.


*Brush your shoulders:


Regret level: Mild Dandruff
 

Jay-Z would be proud


TL;DR:

Nerf Shotguns 
Don’t buy this shit
Bush did 9/11

For real though, go play Save the World, farm some currency, and come back tomorrow to take down the servers.

80,Homo3rectus,1525132917,8g45th,51,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8g45th/moisty_mire_getting_removed/,0,Moisty Mire getting removed?,"Is Moisty Mire getting removed? 

This is probably the best news I've heard in so long. I really hope they remove a lot of other places. I can think of like 5 locations that are simply taking up space. 

1) Moisty Mire - This place is pure garbage. It's almost never in the circle, has pitiful loot, and good luck trekking across it with its stupid swampy pits. Then you have the fact that moisty is HUGEEEEE. Like, the only place on the map that is bigger than it is Anarchy Acres (and that shit has acres in its name so you know that it's gonna be big). All in all, there is absolutely no reason for moisty to exist, let alone take up that much land area. 

2) Dusty Depot - This name is so accurate, because Dusty Depot is actually dusty AF when it comes to loot. Almost every single time I've landed here, I've had zero luck finding a gun. Then someone picks up the only shotgun in the vicinity and sends me back to the lobby before I even get a chance to run around for more than 3 seconds. Please remove this place and replace it with a small town or something

3) Flush Factory - Out of all the things you could add to the game, you decide to add a toilet factory? Completely unnecessary imo. I think Flush should be removed simply because there are already like 2 or 3 other factories in the map. I think seeing a bit more variety in the aesthetics and locations within the map would give the game a lot more character. 

4) Wailing Woods/Lonely Lodge - I think one of these has to go (preferably lonely lodge). When you have Moisty Mire and these two locations, it just seems redundant. Practically the entire east half of the map is woods/forest/marsh. Why not add like a desert or something? Or a tundra? Or some other vastly different landscape. Heck, even a mountain range would be pretty damn cool. (An actual mountain range, not the pussy hills that are dotted around the map). 

4) Loot(less) Lake - I think that there definitely needs to be a large body of water added to the map. But man is this thing a bitch to cross. I think that there needs to be more of an incentive loot-wise for people to land here and give themselves the trouble of having to cross it. Either that or add longer docks to the lake.

5) Fatal Fields - Again, another complete copy-paste. It's a complete waste of space! Why would we need two farms that look almost identical? I think Fatal Fields should be removed in the place of something entirely different, and Anarchy Acres needs to be shrunken a little bit. If you look at the Fortnite map, you'll see that the right half of anarchy acres is completely empty. You could very easily fit an entire location there. Why waste the space?

I feel Fortnite needs more variety both in its locations, and also in the individual structures of the map. If you visit the houses in Pleasant Park and then you go to the houses in Retail Row, you can see they're exactly identical. Most people dont care but I think it's a bit lazy. I hope you guys at least agree with my list though lol ",FortNiteBR

I’m by no means claiming to be some professional, but being fairly decent at the game and feeling that most of the guides posted on here heavily relate more to PC players, I’ve decided to put together a guide full of tips/tricks that will help my fellow console players improve their skill.

Before I even start, everyone PLEASE switch to the builder pro layout!!! Sacrifice a couple of games to get used to it, because once you’ve mastered the button mapping, you’ll never go back and will find yourself building tremendously faster. 

For new players:
- Find a sensitivity that works for YOU. Sensitivity is all about personal preference, don’t switch to 10 &amp; 10 because (guy with 1000 wins) said so. Although, I will say that generally a higher sense will be more beneficial in most cases such as build fights/building in general and shotgun flick shots.

- Want to get better at building? Land Wailing Woods, farm up to max wood, and practice your building. No matter how many games it takes, do this until you’ve mastered basic schemes such as a 1x1, ramp push with a wall in front of every ramp, and the double ramp push. 

- Find yourself losing engagements over and over again? Don’t just tell yourself your opponent got lucky and hop into the next game. Instead, analyze why you died, what you did wrong, and what you could’ve done better. If you really need to work on your combat... land tilted, play extremely aggressive, and don’t leave until you’re the last one left. Trust me, you will find yourself improving by the game. 

- Lastly, STOP STANDING STILL! Always be moving. Jump up and down when sprinting in the open. Move left to right and crouch up and down while farming and popping meds. You can easily tell how skilled a player is by their movement.

For advanced players: 
- You guys already have wins. Stop landing on the edge of the map and playing passive to stack up your wins even more. Sure, you’re winning, but you’re also average 3-4 kills a game. Land in more popular areas and play aggressive as possible. Engage everyone. You’ve already proved that you can win a game or two, so make your next goal to average 10+ kills a game.

- Never be satisfied. Always strive to learn something new. Think you’re a great builder? Go watch Myth, he’s 10x the builder you are. Don’t just watch for entertainment though, but also pay attention to how he plays. I swear, it’s like I learn something I didn’t every time I watch one of his videos or streams. 

FOR ALL: 
- Just play... everyday. The only way to get better at the game is to play the game. Every pro was once a no skin bush camper.

I really hope this was helpful! Please feel free to add/point out anything that I missed. Anyways, have a good day and God bless!",FortNiteBR

All i run into is John Wicks and guys that dont know how to do anything but build and the game is filled with rng. Pumps constantly give me 9 damage shots and it’s frustrating asf. The only reason i play Fortnite now is to only win and i kind of hate that its like that. There is just no more fun in the game to me and I usually get headaches playing cause i get so mad sometimes. I just cant wait for RDR2 to come out so i can just take a fat break from Fortnite because as of right now Fortnite is the only game that satisfies me when i do good. ,FortNiteBR

Here’s my quick suggestion, that would make the pre game lobby more entertaining. Give us infinite materials! Here are some of the benefits:



-No skins can watch John Wicks build like ninja and myth had a baby

-You can practice building

-You can build more than 3 units of materials

-You can trap people in boxes and try to watch them escape

-You can build to the sky

-Maybe they could make it so you could try building to the actual island, and depending on people shooting it down or the time you have, you could make it there

Also they should add a few launch pads around the pre game lobby",FortNiteBR

Now hear me out.

# Extra proof for that the meteor is hitting soon

We've all seen the televisions on static all throughout the map.

![img](38myi5g5g3v01)

So  what I thought about these is that the meteor must be emitting some  sort of radio waves/radiation intervening with the TV signals, however  it could also be the case that the UFO next to the meteor is either trying to contact us but failing *or* they send the comet our way on purpose to kill us all.

Oh  yeah, also, FRAGMENTS OF THE METEOR ARE LITERALLY ALREADY FALLING DOWN.  Which tells us it's highly likely it has already entered the  atmosphere, burning up and fragmenting.

# Why it isn't hitting Tilted

I  have multiple reasons to believe this isn't the case namely that Epic  is smart, not just smart, brilliant. Do you think they'll just do what  everyone is expecting? I didn't think so. One of the other reasons is  only valid in the case that the UFO is trying to save us; aboard the UFO  are the superheroes for the season 4 battle pas who will save us from  the meteor in an epic scene. And while yes, there are these signs on top of Tilted Towers:

![img](tyubram9g3v01)

What  exactly are they saying? None of them directly show a meteor going  towards Tilted.  They maybe cries for help, heck, one of them even shows  [the UFO inside a heart](https://imgur.com/N089grA), further establishing they are most likely going to save us.

# Where it is going if it isn't Tilted

Good question. You're smart. I like you. Of course, this is only relevant if the UFO doesn't save us.

I don't really have any proof for this but it is most likely going to Lucky Landing.

Think about it, it makes perfect sense because:

1. No one lands there.
2. It was made for the Chinese New Year event which was, mind you, on February 18th.
3. It really is out of theme, just having *one* Asian place in an eastern European\(?\) map

**Alternative meteor location**

You  know that awkward indent on the Southwest of the map? What if it hits  there, filling it up and causing a flood in the Greasy Grove \- Flush  Factory area.

![img](gwbwfntag3v01)

I'm a Photoshop wizard

This  would give  us a new location POI called Crashed Comet and would give  the surrounding areas a fun twist. I mean, imagine fighting through  Greasy with 50cm of water.

# Dusty Depot

I came halfway through this theory and then you guys started going

&gt;Fuck Tilted! Dusty it is

And you guys started trowing art like this around

![img](h9t5la2sg3v01 ""Props to OP show him some love"")

IMO it's still pretty questionable, look at the evidence\(correct me if I missed anything\)

|Proof|Source|Note|

|Magma sounds near Dusty|nowhere to be seen|Could not reproduce|
|Leaked|Someone please provide the link||

Seems questionable at the very least, right? Now let's look at the evidence for the Tilted theory\(Equally as likely as my theory IMO\):

|Proof|Source|Note|

|Morse signals|[This Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88i57r/controller_vibration_translated_to_morse_audio/)|You're a legend. Plus, is everyone just going to forget this? It seems pretty conclusive|
|The Fortnite maps resembles Poland and the location in which Tilted is in Fortnite is Poznań IRL which, you guessed it, was hit by a meteorite|[It's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pozna%C5%84)|Seems unlikely they predicted this when they made the map all the way at the beginning of Battle Royal.|

Which one has more evidence/has more direct evidence.

# Possible prove that none of this is happening

[The Game Theorists](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w) made a video in which they get into the science of the meteor.

![video](szizcbseg3v01)

You can watch the whole thing but the tl;dr is that the meteor is too light to do any harm.

# To conclude

I'm  not regularly a theorist but I wanted to share this with you guys, so  it is possible I made a mayor oversight making my whole theory crumble  to pieces.

**TL;DR**:  Meteor isn't going to Tilted nor is it going to Dusty, it might not come at all, it might  destroy Lucky Landing, it might land near Greasy and Flush Factory.

^(I totally didn't spend 4 days on this theory which will more than likely fall apart because of a mayor oversight on my part)",FortNiteBR

Also, responses like this:

“Where did they say it was the tier 100 skin?”

A day before season 3, they tweeted out the image of John wick, which was the tier 100 skin

A day before season 4, which is today, they reveal a fifth outfit, that is very clearly the best looking skins they’ve revealed

As well as:

“The picture had 3 other skins that are new”

First of all, the other 3 skins are already in the game, so pay attention

Even this:

“They said John wick was the tier 100 skin before season 3”

Please?","If you're having this issue, you can skip to the \*\*TL;DR\*\* at the bottom. Everything else is just an explanation of what I went through to get me to this bug/glitch/issue for those who aren't familar with what we're going through.     

.     

I have been gaming on Xbox since the end of PS2's era. Three generations later and I'm on the Xbox One. In the past couple years I've met some new friends I've grown quite close to. I was always strictly a PUBG man. I had \*\*thee most\*\* common complaints for Fortnite. Too cartonnish and I didn't like the building aspect. But my new friends all played Fortnite and loved it. I decided to secretly download it for my Xbox and play the shit out of it to get up to par for average players. With the new cross\-platform play, I was able to game with them on their PS4's while I was on my gaming laptop, using my xbox controller.     

.     

Well. PC servers are not kind to controller users. We were doing pretty good but we definitely could tell when we went up against a M&amp;Kb squad. So I decided, screw it. I bought a Playstation 4 Slim yesterday. I snapped them the box and they flipped shit. They immediately got online and I began the downloads. Fortnite was downloaded. I was ready to finally play with my new friends, strictly on the PS4 servers...Nope.     

.     

.     

\*\*""Your account can not play on this platform.""\*\* Hmm. Did a little research while they were blowing up my messages with invites. Seemed like it wasn't possible to have an Xbox One profile and a Playstation 4 profile linked to the same EPIC account. Which seemed strange because there was an option to have all three \(PC, Xbox and PS4\) linked to the same EPIC account. I didn't want to unlink my Xbox One profile, because doing so would permantly delete all of my saved progress, levels and even vbucks saved and cosmetics bought. That simply wasn't worth it to me. So I was forced to create a new account just for my Playstation 4.     

.     

Now. If I've invested time and money into the game for one single EPIC account, I really wouldn't want to have to buy \*two\* Battle Passes tomorrow to play with my brothers and with my PS4 buddies. I've searched this issue through the EPIC GAMES forums, as well as different Fortnite subreddits \(including this sub\). A lot of people have been having this issue. But since a lot of people don't own both consoles, or even less likely play Fortnite on both consoles frequently, the issue hasn't gotten any attention from EPIC...     

.     

.     

.     

So. \*\*EPIC.\*\* Here is simply what we are looking for. Is this an issue being looked at, or is it even an issue at all? Were Xbox and PS4 profiles not able to be linked on the same EPIC account intentional? If so, I'm sure there is a good reason for it, which I'm not inclined to get all raged out over. Maybe it has something to do with cross\-platform character progression? Maybe there were hopes of cross platform play between the two consoles \(likely will never happen\) which would make the two profiles linked cause issues? Whatever the reason is, we would simply just like a response from you.     

\-     

\-     

\-     

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* At this time, you can only have one of two possible profile links for one EPIC account. Either Xbox One profile and PC profile linked. Or Playstation 4 profile and PC profile linked. You can link Console A and PC. But linking Console A first \(whichever console that is\) will cause Console B to be ""locked out"" of playing. And there currently isn't a known reason or workaround for this. A lot of threads address this issue but none have official word from EPIC. In an effort to get their attention, I've explained thoroughly my situation and the issue. My hopes are that EPIC will respond, so that when other players, like myself, run into this issue they will google what I did, and come across this post and see EPICs response.",FortNiteBR

But this time, we’re going to honor a place that should be the center of attention, because it’s literally in the middle of the map. But the thing is, we’ve been taking this place for granted. Nobody lands here but tonight that’ll change. The Dusty Depot Wake Ceremony.

Tonight, April 30th 2018, at exactly 5:30 PM PST, we will all queue up at the *exact* same time into solos in the *Oceania* servers to honor this POI that we’ve taken for granted. Visit this [link](time.gov) for an exact queue up time. This is across *all* platforms. We’ll be breaking every breakable object in the Depot. After that we’ll *attempt* to build a huge box around the perimeter of the Depot and have a massive emote showdown in the box. That’s all it is, just a fun way to remember the POI if it *does* get removed from the game. 

Rules:

*Must* have either the John Wick *or* Default Skin equipped (any back bling)

Those who do not have either one of these skins will be pickaxed to death; we didn’t enforce this rule enough at the Tilted Towers Wake Ceremony, so if you do see anyone with another skin, kill them. 

Absolutely no shooting. Anyone who shoots will be pickaxed to death by everyone else who is participating.

If you see anyone who is attempting to interfere with/troll the event, pickaxe them to death. *NO SHOOTING*

I *will* be streaming this for those who want to watch once again, so make sure to follow my [Twitch](twitch.tv/sqoof) and my Twitter (@xsqoof) to stay tuned for when I go live for the ceremony.

Upvote this to spread the word, once the time comes we should have enough people for the ceremony if we get enough upvotes, just like the Tilted Towers Wake Ceremony. Share this across all social medias so we can all honor this POI that we never acknowledge. Let’s have another night to remember, just like we did with the previous Wake Ceremony.

Whereas in EU everyone is usually pretty good, almost every body builds and if they don't its because they're a bot.

Watching NA streamers they seem to be able to easily sprint and build up to players shooting at them and with the high ground without much worry of being shot or even being killed unless of course the player they're pushing is half way decent, on top of that their fights rarely turn into build wars (atleast in comparison to the amount of kills they get) whereas in EU almost all my fights end in some kind of build war unless they are a distance away. Also the majority or kills they get are pretty easy where the guy they shoot at takes way too long to protect themselves (again as if they were playing mobile) leaving themselves open for easy kills, whereas on EU the majority of players even the bad ones can spam down walls quick enough to stop themselves from being easily killed. 

I'm not saying the NA streamers are bad players because they clearly aren't just that in general NA players are worse than EU, as you rarely find a armed EU player that is an easy kill, unless you A.

A bit of a background: I have 1Gb Google Fiber at my house; I live in ATL and normally get 950 down/700 up Mbps speeds with 2 ms ping to the selected servers here in Georgia. Having said that, on good days, my ping in-game is normally pretty damn low (talking 0-5 ms during the game, shown in the net debug stats). 

However, at **random** times, I will load into a game and maintain a ping of 200-250 ms, making the game laggy and terrible to play. I play on NA East and have had this problem for a few weeks now. Normally, the fix is to leave the match and reload, hoping for a ""good"" server instance. This becomes extra frustrating when I play squads, as I don't want to be rude and leave solely because of my ping and have to reload to get a better instance.

I don't ever seem to have this problem playing on NA West, where I consistently get a ping of 20-30 ms. I cannot ever replicate the issue, and I know with a certainty that it is not my own PC or internal network.

My question is: do other Google Fiber users seem to have this issue in NA East, or even users of other ISPs? Is this a Fortnite problem with how the netcode routes traffic, or is this on Google's end with their hops and pushing me through some congested pipe to the AWS servers?

Feel free to chime in and let me know what you guys think. All help will be appreciated!",FortNiteBR

369,memelordking,1525093467,8fzaeq,20,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8fzaeq/lets_talk_about_the_grenade_launcher/,29,Let's talk about the Grenade Launcher,"If you've just started playing the game it may seem that the Rocket Launcher  is the best explosive weapon but really, the Grenade Launcher is miles ahead. Ninja himself said at his Las Vegas event that the Grenade Launcher is the weapon he would always choose to carry due to it's ridiculous DPS potential, even the best builders can't outbuild it. I know many people here don't like Ninja but his talent and knowledge of the game should still be respected. Here is why the Grenade Launcher is so strong:

* Imagine if the Rocket Launcher (RL) could load 6 rockets in a clip. That would be considered ridiculously OP. Yet the Grenade Launcher (GL) can fire off 6 grenades in just a few seconds, each of which dealing a minimum of 100 (110 for Legendary) damage in a splash area. The reload speed of a GL is ~3 seconds, about 1 second more than for RLs (depending on rarity for both). That extra second is nothing considering you are then able to spam an extra 5 projectiles that do the same amount of damage. 

* The GL is versatile, it can be used at medium-long range in a fashion where grenades can splash directly onto players sitting in their 1X1. Alternatively it can be used by bouncing the grenade off ramps at close range to angle the grenades at nearby players. You can easily stop a close-range double ramp-double wall push by simply spamming grenades at the base of the ramp, or by angling grenades onto the top of the ramp where the player is pushing. 

* The nature of the Grenades mean that their bounce is really difficult to judge, thus counterbuilding is incredibly difficult. Any bump in the ground can completely change the trajectory of the grenade so one that is seemingly going to 10 metres ahead of you can suddenly land on your head. 2 of those and you are dead no matter how many jugs you have chugged. The player with the GL can simply adjust grenade positioning depending on where they see the grenades landing, whereas the person being attacked has no idea where they are going to go.

* You can do damage without exposing yourself. A big advantage of the GL is that the grenades arc downwards, meaning that the user can simply hide in a 1X1 and spam it outwards at the enemy without needing to peak. This cannot be done with the RL due to the straight-line trajectory of rockets meaning the opponent has a chance to snipe the RL user or at least get some assault rifle damage in when they peak.

* Grenades are really visually undistinctive. They blend in with the sky, the ground and with structures. Sure the GL is pretty loud when firing, but when you hear it being fired you just have to spam walls and roofs and pray that they aren't landing on top of you, because you won't see them til they're next to you. On the other hand, the RL fires rockets that have a distinctive colour/trail and make a constant noise meaning that there is a chance to block the attack. I'm not sure of the exact projectile speeds but grenades definitely move more quickly than rockets so there is less time to identify where they are coming from. 

I love the Grenade Launcher, I've had countless Victory Royales from just spamming it at enemies I can barely even see. I think the bouncing mechanic of the grenades makes it an extremely interesting weapon that rewards creativity and it has a higher skill ceiling than the RL. Having such a powerful explosive weapons is not necessarily a bad thing, the current casual Fortnite meta seems to be leaning towards camping in 1X1s with sniper rifles, and I think the Grenade Launcher is a fantastic counter to that and is very rewarding if you use it aggressively. However, I think it needs a tweak.

* The simplest way to nerf it would be to reduce grenade damage, although this is fairly unimaginative, and a well placed grenade should still be rewarded with high damage.

* I think Epic Games should look to another fantastic game for inspiration. In Team Fortress 2, the Grenade Launcher comes with 4 grenades in a clip. I think this is a viable number as it would reduce the weapons capacity for spam, meaning that players would need to aim their grenades more for the weapon to be effective. 

* Alternatively, reducing the fire rate or just increasing reload speed would also make the weapon less conducive to spamming.

* Another aspect of the Team Fortress 2 Grenade Launcher I like is the distinctive grenade trails/colours (https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Grenade_Launcher#/media/File:Grenade_proj_red.png).
Having the grenades shimmer either bright red or blue would really help for identifying the source of damage and allow for more creative counterbuilding/dodging than just spamming walls and roofs and hoping for the best. 
 

Let me know what you think, is the Grenade Launcher really that strong or should I just build more lol.

Another thing is that I said the Superhero Theme for S4 isn't confirmed, got mass downvoted, somebody replied saying the exact same thing and it got up voted.. ??? 

There's also been countless times when I've seen someone's opinion get downvoted, I reply to that person and say ""Why are you being downvoted? This is your opinion, the downvote button isn't a disagree button - its used for spam comments."" And I got mass downvoted, AND had people replying to me saying ""Oh!

This isn't for everyone here, although it is a majority, but the fact people can't handle opinions and can't tell jokes apart from reality even with a big sign saying ""JOKE"" next to it is insane. Its come to the point that people are so stupid, that comments like ""Just build lol"" have lost all meaning and become memes so that ignorant people can use them without being criticized because ""its just a prenk bro xDdXD :dab:emote""

225pts - Win
100pts - 2nd 
50pts - 3rd 
50pts - per kill 

This is just a mock up and I’m sure there’s a better points system and more things you could get points for. Maybe less points (25pts say) if you’re camping in a tower.

Nobody can honestly say they like them. All they do is cause frustration and don't reward skilled play at all.

If you want Fortnite to be taken seriously, if you want to keep your player base, if you want to have a competitive scene, if you want to make more money, this needs to be your NUMBER ONE priority.

Having played religiously since day one \(Account level 300, 700\+ wins\), I'm on the fence right now if I want to play season 4. I find myself getting frustrated more often than I'm having fun. Its saddening when a game with such potential is ruined by not having basic balanced shooting mechanics.

It really sucks in my opinion. I hate doing 20 damage with an AR to someone who isn't in my face.

FSA is a big change that wasn't needed but it seems fine so far so I would like it to stay. I personally loved the RNG shooting on Fortnite and I feel like it has a big place in the game.

I will start off slow and soft with 3 push ups every loss that I will accumulate up towards 6/9 before I do them. As the weeks go on I will start putting out more and more push ups depending on my body. People are telling me  that ""omg just 3 push ups per loss"" etc. So my response to that is, try doing it for 4\-6 hours when you are at 115kg \(255lbs\). I will also be doing sit ups when I feel like I cant do more push ups, which happens very often just a few hours in to the stream because my shoulders often cant take too many push ups, so I transition to sit ups instead.

Outside of the camera I will also be eating better, I have quit sugar and I will be on a low calorie diet for as long as I can. Do you have any tips or tricks on how to make this challenge even better? Feel free to come in to my chat and talk me up :D!

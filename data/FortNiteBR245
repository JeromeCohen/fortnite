 GENERAL

* Double Barrel Shotgun: devastating at close range, the Double Barrel Shotgun packs a punch with each of its 2 shots. 
* New LTM: Steady Storm.  This Storm waits for no player and there are no safe zones. Stay aware of the map and keep moving it to the center of the circle in the Steady Storm LTM. 
* The remaining time left in the Item Shop and Event Store will now appear correctly in Battle Royale and in Save the World.
* Certain interactions will now interrupt reloading.

BUG FIXES  

* Reset to Default will now properly reset keys to the default values.
* Changing input options will show a confirmation message if replacing a current input bind.
* Audio for automatic weapons no longer cuts out after tapping the fire button and then immediately pressing and holding the fire button.
* Fixed an issue that could cause multiple selection boxes to appear when using a controller.
* Reduced memory usage of internal object reference search systems. This will help prevent out of memory crashes.
* Non-English audio device names in the audio settings menu will now display correctly.
* Players using voice chat will no longer join the wrong channels when rapidly switching parties, join the wrong voice channels, or be unable to send or receive voice chat in most cases.
* The mouse cursor lock state in windowed mode will now function properly. Alt-tabbing will return mouse lock status.
* The ‘Sprint Cancels Reload’ option will now function properly with “Sprint by Default” enabled.
* Fixed some display issues with the interaction between the display resolution, 3D resolution, and video quality settings in the Options screen.
* The keyboard 'key' hotkey background has been updated to increase legibility.
* Party system is now more responsive to errors related to connection loss when sending certain party messages like kicking and promoting. Should reduce issues with managing party.",FortNiteBR

As it seems it might be  similar to the visitor where we have no idea until the update before the challenges are released but I was studying the outline with a buddy and we were trying to work out what it could be. We both noticed the irregular shape of the think and we thought it must be some naturally formed rock man or mud man.  But then we realised that the fortnite mad already has rock men ; The easter island heads that are facing salty springs.  This brings us to believe that the roadtrip skin will be a Easter Island Head skin.  If this is what it will be give me you opinion whether you think it will be as a big a flop as the visitor. Although it will probably good for the people who like the derpy skins like Tomatohead, moisty merman, etc.

It's like taking a relaxing break. 

It bothers me that 50vs50 is always left but then other LTM's are always removed after a week and as of recently, Epic hasn't been adding a new one after pulling another like they used too. I personally think Epic should rotate LTM's on a every other week basis. 

Fly Explosives stays for another week while 50v50 is removed and a new LTM is introduced. Then the following week Fly Explosives is removed, last weeks LTM stays and so on. Every other week rotation. ",FortNiteBR

**TUTORIAL:**

**STEP 1: GET YOUR IP ADDRESS**

Let's get to business shall we?

First do me a favor. Go to your router and get your default IP Address. Some routers (Cisco as far as I'm concerned) have a sticker that say ""Advanced Settings"" and has an IP Address that looks like this "" [192.168.1.254/](https://192.168.1.254/) "" if your router doesn't have one. 

**WINDOWS:** 

Start Menu. Type "" cmd "". Type on the Terminal "" ipconfig "" and all the details of your router should be there. IP Address is on the description after Default Gateway. 

**macOS**: 

Click on WiFi Logo. Open Network Preferences. Advanced. TCP/IP. After the Router title your IP Address should/must be there. 

**Dummies:**

Literally type "" what's my IP address? "" or in Spanish "" ¿Cuál es mi dirección IP? "" in the Google Search Bar. 

**STEP 2: OPEN A NEW TAB AND TYPE IN YOUR IP ADDRESS**

To log in most of the time is your SSID and your Wifi Password (default) unless you changed it. If you can't access search for the username and password of the company owner of the router. For me is the name of the company that provides my internet and my wifi password. Each router and each company has their own way to grant you access to the router advanced settings.

**STEP 3: A USER INTERFACE OF YOUR ROUTER SHOULD OPEN**

Search for Port Forwarding. It's located in Advanced Settings or Network Settings. 

Once you're in Port Forwarding you should be able to do the following. 

Create a new Port \[you can insert whatever name you want\] and add that specific/custom port to a certain device (gives you a list) IF that's not the case just add XBOX IP ADDRESS. [192.168.1.73](https://192.168.1.73)

**STEP 4: INPUT THE PORTS THAT MUST BE OPENED!**

**Xbox Ports** **UDP**: 88, 3074, 53, 500, 3544, 4500 **TCP**: 3074, 53, 80  

**PS4 Ports TCP**: 80, 443, 1935, 3478-3480 **UDP**: 3478-3479  

**PC Ports** **TCP**: 5222, 5795-5847 **UDP**: 5222, 5795-5847  

**Nintendo Switch Port** **TCP**: 6667, 12400, 28910, 29900, 29901, 29920 **UDP**: 1-65535

For most routers settings you're allowed to input UDP/TCP at the same time IF you're not allowed to do that then just add the same number twice with UDP and the other one with TCP. 

I'm adding screenshots of my UI and how you should do it. In case you get lost.

**MISCELLANEOUS:**  

From posts I've seen and other sources including me playing I think the problem is the actual render time as you can see in this video that happened to me a while ago. 

r/https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/riversmakris/video/57684381

It doesn't have to be the actual place where you land but the play-doh effect of something near you but you're not looking at it. This started when Tilted Towers was first added and like many people have mentioned this is a problem across the WHOLE map because it needs to load, ATK, Shopping Carts, Chests, Rifts, building created by foes and the countless buildings. IMO Tilted Towers and Paradise Palms is more than enough to give an OG XBONE a hard time rendering everything at the same time. 

After applying the changes and activating port forwarding I was finally able to practice without hitting 300 Ping on Solo playgrounds my building.

**TL;DR** 

Be a douche bag. Restart your router making everyone at your house disconnect from WiFi and let everyone know to STOP watching Netflix because you're tRyIng tO bUiLD lol GG M8.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**BACKGROUND OF MY PROBLEM AND SOME INFO.**

I'm a software engineer (or trying to become/be one) and recently Fortnite has been very sh\*tty for me. I live in Mexico which is a ""*decent""* distance between me and Epic Servers. 

From tomorrow I'll be taking a course called Networks and what a better start to do something you enjoy isn't it?

Portrait this. I play on a OG XBONE and my WiFi Stats are as follow: 50 mpbs for download and 10 mbps for upload (this can vary) and my connection is not parallel as you can see. Even though on the settings it says you'll have 65ms depending on the servers you're at this is just an estimate and can go higher... WAY HIGHER. For instance, my gaming sessions went from 70 ping to 325 to 1,100; this is literally unplayable and I have a great disadvantage against other players. 

Please let me know if this somehow helped you because it did for me. 

I live in Mexico. I have a wifi provider from an ex-monopoly company so if I was able to do this I don't know why anyone outside of Mexico can't. 

I went from 70 ping to 38 being the LOWEST ping I've ever record. 

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for your time and Happy Building!

P.D. Hopefully Epic Games can fix the play-doh effect that's happening on this upcoming patch.",FortNiteBR

Expanding Viking Territory.
Vikings are conquerors. I mean, the Norse glider is called Conquest! So if the ancient Norse have set foot on Fortnite Island, they likely won't stay in their mountain village for long, especially if Ragnarok is leading them. 
Changes- From the mountain village, Snobby Shores and Greasy Grove as well as the land in between should be engulfed in snow. The village should get a name, Valhalla Vistas sounds alright, Greasy grove gets hit with a terrible blizzard, losing it's named status and being turned into a veritable ice rink with ice you can slide on, and Snobby should become Snowy Shores, and take on an amalgamated look between the existing rich homes and the viking architecture.

With Greasy gone, I could see the area south of the tunnel by Tomato turned into a 'south side'. Maybe change the name to Delivery Drive or something fast-food related? The new Durrr should be here. 

Lastly, Loot Lake. Keep the name, but I could see the dock buildings changing to a colonial style Caribbean fort, and the various islands becoming more tropical, with the house island changing to a shipwreck island.

Well, I don't wanna get too crazy, so I'll leave that there. ",FortNiteBR

What if every location you can build something had some constraint. You build a wall, it gets broken, you're able to instantly rebuild, and again, and again, and again, but as you rebuild more and more in a short time span you will start to get delayed in a way where the wall will only get placed after a higher and higher delay as you keep spamming builds. Keep in mind this is constrained to **locations**. Say you're spamming a wall in front of you and hit that cooldown there, you'd still be able to build instantly anywhere else because you werent spamming builds there.

Dont get me wrong, with how the game **currently** is I'd never want to see this mechanic, but if the spam was toned down to something closer to pre-smg buff I'd think this would be... interesting? You can still counterspam a whole clip of your enemy but when he hits the reload you gotta get out of there and try to actually do something.

Something that definitely needs to be thought trough just came to my mind: Distant spamming. I'm not sure how this would work out when somebody from a distance spams your walls. I'm sure this would make fights less annoying as it'd either push you to make a move or retreat but I can see how people would dislike this. All in all I think this would be favorable.

Wood - Wood changes are reverted, both starting health and total health
Why - Wood is primarily used for pushing enemies, with the recent wood strength change it has become too easy to shoot down an enemy who is pushing or trying to build up. The main reason this was done was to address turtling and boxing in. Those will be addressed through other points/items.
Edit Peeking - Like sight in to the storm, when peeking through the edit viewer distant objects will be obfuscated, and near objects will be visible.
Why - The edit peek change did not serve its intended purpose of preventing players from gaining visibility when camping in a box. Players get around this by using pyramids and ramps for peeking. What this change did do is hurt aggressive play and assist turtling. This was done by making a wall edit to shotgun far less ideal, and helped turtling because someone who is in a massive build structure can more easily hide when the player attacking them can no longer replace their walls and look for them.
Drum Gun - Reduce damage, reduce clip size, and possibly add in damage more penalizing damage falloff.
Why - The drum gun is arguable the best gun in the game. Its DPS is very high, and its utility is top tier in terms of providing reliable damage to palyers, shooting structures, and having a very large clip with a medium fire rate.
Stink Bombs - Increase carry rate to 6, increase drop rate.
Why - They come in stacks of 3, make the total stack 6 because OCD and to increase their viability as they are a great turtling counter. Increase drop rate to further promote the use of stink bombs. 
Shotguns - Tricky one here... Remove pump pull out delay. Slightly less damage fall off for all shotguns (aka slightly able to shoot further, verbiage for this changes from person to person). Increase damage to tac and pump (do not allow pump to 1 shot)
Why - Pump delay is unnecessary at this point. Helping the shotgun at range/with damage is needed to counter SMGs which currently dominate shotguns at short range and at short-mid range.
Burst Rifles - Slight increase to structure damage, reduce bloom.
Why - Make them suck less. They are awful at dealing with structures, and can be more viable as an option to sneak in shots on someone turtling. The 2nd and 3rd shots of burst rifles are far too inaccurate at this point, but they should not be increased to the point in which if the first shot hits they all do, then they would be overpowered in terms of player damage.
Deagle/Revolver - Reduce damage falloff, allow first shot accuracy to be reached in slightly less time. In air bloom is reduced to be on par with bloom with boots on the ground.
Why - These guns do barely more than a scar shot from range, and they take too long to reach first shot accuracy to justify exposing yourself for that long. Lastly the in air buff is to give these guns a niche role of dynamic in air weapons. Just imagine getting a quick turnaround 180 deagle shot for 150+ damage that didn't happen solely because you got ""good bloom"".
P90x - Reduce clip size.
Why - This gun can be shot for far too long in its current state. 40 would be ideal. I also do not want to neuter SMG damage at this point with the wood health reversion. They do have a high DPS still in close quarters, but the shotgun buff should help with that, and the wood health increase will allow a shotgun+quick wall to be an effective strategy against spray.
Minigun - Increase bloom. Minigun overheats after extended use. 1 to half second cooldown and must revamp the fire rate.
Why - This one can go either way, but figured I'd throw it out there. The miniguns role is for damaging structures, not players, so bloom should be increased a tiny bit. The minigun can be held down against structures for far too long with the 1K small bullet cap. It is also very easy to walk and spray after someone as the mini gun outclasses the scar in DPS (by 15%) and is on par with the drum gun in terms of DPS.
Explosives - Have a dynamic blast radius with falloff in terms of structure damage. (Does NOT apply to C4)
Why - Happy medium of the massive damage to structures they do now and the only one wall they would take down in the old days. The main issue with the RL/GL in this state is that they can take out a multilayer ramp push in one shot, which makes it near impossible to push a player with a RL in a metal 1x1. This will be the happy medium, and the best use against a multilayer ramp push would be to go RPG, and they AR down the remaining health of the walls that were only slightly affected by the reduced ""outer layer"" damage. Slows shooting down a push in terms of overall DPS, forces some more thought in managing reloads and switching weapons.
This is all I have recommendations on at this point. I'm sure there are some great ideas for C4, clingers, SMG damage, and others that I couldn't think of. Overall I think C4 and clingers are in a pretty good spot as they are bad against players and great against turtling. The main issue I have against SMGs (and kind of minigun) is that they are the best option against players and structures, so you can seamlessly shoot down a structure and then mow down a player.",FortNiteBR

I think bringing back 1 pump or making the heavy able to hit for 200 in the head is the way to make both parties happy. If someone is turtled and he has a player constantly spraying one of his walls with an SMG, he can line up the perfect headshot before one of his walls goes down in order to counter the spray.

On the other side of the argument, it will require that person spraying to actually think about what they're doing. Maybe set up some cover or spray while moving and jumping. Basically, they'd have top be careful about the spraying and it'd be less mindless.

Currently, SMG spam counters building, building counters shotguns but shotguns aren't countering SMG spam. I'm confident that a one hit shotgun is the way to do it.

Fingers crossed the new shotgun can do it but i'm not hopeful.",FortNiteBR

This is just a breakdown of the games mechanics and a few reasons why everybody is going offline these days. It all started in mid season 4 when epic wanted to counter the building and shotguns to give the casual players an advantage.

Here are a few reasons why this game has lost mine and many others interest:

-the nerf to materials on the ground, one of the only methods to survive early game when you got trash RNG, and someones blasting you with an smg/shotgun. Now they’ve added guns with increased fire rate with 50 bullet magazines that can kill you in only 4 or 5 hits to the body, so forget about surviving with those 20 mats.

-nerf to shotguns, the shotguns are what you need in clutch situations while facing more than one guy, especially with low hp. The recent nerf to shotguns have made that one hit kill impossible with massive bullet droprate and damage reductions that you are better off using a drumgun or an smg then aim for the head, unless you have the heavy which is super rare and imbalanced with the other shotguns. Basically if you don’t have the heavy you need to rely on the RNG of spread to win close quarters combat, which is a slap in the face to aggressive players.

-glitches, in nearly every one of my games, some type of glitch has a role in how I died. One of these is the floor glitch while turbo building, it has a delay so I can’t set it right away and end up falling because of it. The yellow materials now after you build, love not being able to see anything after getting blown up and shot through these walls. The lag glitch where you can watch a whole fight go down, and not even be able to shoot anyone or pickup anything for 30 seconds, then getting teleported 100ms behind yourself. Laggy players that are hard to hit, my traps not placing instantly when i trap someone in a box, I could go on but I’m sure many others could add into this.



And I’m too tired to go on, but yeah you get it, basically the game relies more on RNG now than it ever has and everyone is dieing over bullsht reasons, there are no build fights anymore and the new meta is just garbage all in all. 

Tl;dr fix ur frigging game

But do you think I should've waited for Halloween, where there will be some good 800 v-bucks skins? Or do you think in Halloween they'll only release expensive skins? I wonder if I should've just waited for them to release like a zombie version of the commando player model for 800 v-bucks. (Unless it'll cost much more, then it's a different story).

Today I played duos with a friend (roughly 6-7 matches) and I honestly probably got 4-5 kills in total. Yep. You heard me, pretty pathetic. Granted, my friend is not amazing or anything either but he's marginally better than I am (though I never want to admit it lol). I just can't keep up.

This is what generally happens in a match -

I land, frantically attempt to locate a gun/loot/ammo, (if I don't get obliterated in the process) then run around like a chicken with its head cut off trying to round up supplies. When I hear an enemy I almost always immediately freak the fuck out, lose all sense of rationality and run outside, try and build up, then the enemy swoops in and just slaughters me like it's nothing at all. Or, when I'm in a gunfight I'll end up clumsily building, trying to get to higher ground, the enemy will outsmart me and alas, I am dead. Seriously, I just can't seem to keep up with these players who are somehow able to run around like a rabid bunny and build lighting speed and just blast away with kills. It's funny because I am very good at R6:Siege (KDR is 1.54) and I've been playing UT since 2003 (even when I was 10 I could play better than this), but this game is a whole new beast and I can't seem to tackle it. It's quite frankly unbelievable how some of these players are able to do the things they do (Ninja, etc). I thought I had improved by playing 50v50 but that wasn't worth a shit - I was averaging 5-7 kills per game and my building has only slightly improved, I guess with 50v50 there is so much chaos and you have teammates always by your side so it makes it easier. I don't know.

Tips? Suggestions? About to just throw in the towel with this game and go back to Siege.

I never pick it up because it's a waste of heavy bullets to get disappointing damage compared to sniper rifles in my opinion. 

Giving it medium bullets, while not changing any stats, bringing it to be more in the same line as it's cousin the revolver feels to me like a low risk, high reward buff. Simply because medium bullets are more widely available, and the Deagle uses up much more ammo than sniper rifles, so you wouldn't need to worry about it eating all your sniper bullets, or not using a sniper simply because of this.

As a courtesy reminder, the subreddit will go into restricted mode during Patch downtime.

--- 

We reviewed all of the feedback we received during our first run of this mode, the feedback can be found:

**[here](https://imgur.com/a/jWSD7tN#dPSbXdF)**

---

**Here is how it will work:**

Once downtime begins around 3:45 - 4:00am EST - the sub will be entering restricted mode. Only Epic Employees and Moderators will be able to submit posts. You will still be able to comment (rules still apply)

## Why?

Normally, with each patch downtime, people already spam when is it coming up, where are patch notes, etc. We are anticipating this to be exponentially increased with this patch.

----

Patch Notes will be posted and stickied on the front page. Any news articles and relevant information will be posted either by Epic or a moderator.

**Once downtime ends, restricted mode will be TURNED OFF approximately 20-25 minutes after the servers are back up. At this time, people can freely post again.**

There will be our normal patch index megathread where we will continue to consolidate all the popular news, threads, and hot topics (such as datamined skins).

I also like the motel but motel usually attracts a lot of people depending on the circle. 

Crates is also nice but it suffers from the same issue as motel. 

There’s that weird church looking house west of greasy grove...another great location that I always seem to survive at during end game. 

That spot everybody’s trying to keep a secret. If you know, you know. 

The mountain next to salty but the loot ain’t good enough for all the people that go there.

Entitled because the game I payed money for changed to be a much more casual, less fun version of what it used to be? Screw that, I'm 100% going to complain. They are making shit tons of money off of us, and adding in content every week doesn't change the fact that they are making this game SO MUCH WORSE.

Season 3/4 was about build battles. Remember all those crazy build battle videos we all awed over, then got better ourselves, and did those crazy build battles? What happened to that? I have yet to be in a build battle that was 1/10 of the average build battle before. Destroying building is way too easy, with machine guns or explosives, they just crumble. Explosions should NOT explode past walls, destroying walls behind it. This creates an environment where less skilled players can not have to build almost whatsoever. The entire point of the game is just gone with this. Then to kill it even more, they add better building destroying guns, then nerf building! If it isn't clear to you they are making this for casual gamers, mostly cod players(i played cod, but for casual mindless shooting purposes, not building purposes) that are sick of the shitty new cods. 

If you want build battles, stand up to epic and stop being a pussy and telling them they can make their game however much worse they want and you will still buy their shit.

TLDR: Epic is making tons of money watering this game down for casual players, instead of making a decent game.",FortNiteBR

I think if the starting drops had a somewhat evenly distributed amount of player clusters, the mid game would be way funner. There are about 25 POIs on the map, if each POI had 2-3 players land in it and the rest land in random locations, there would be small firefights across the map, with victors in each POI, we would see about ~60 people left after the first circle instead of having ~30 people left, making the mid-game funner.

Or I'll jump and the stairs will build on top of me and I'll get caught underneath. The new aim has really messed me up, and I've found myself in multiple situations being shot without seeing the other guy. My head will be in the way. 

I'm so excited for where the game is going. It's so close to allowing any tactic for any situation. I've loved seeing the meta move around to show players how the game can play differently. 

This week I hope they can fix a few things. I'll be right back on my way to playing fortnite everyday. 

What I hope they fix this week:

-Find a way to slightly Nerf spray and pray

-optimize performance issues, especially builder pro on console

-buff the shotguns


If this all works out, which I know Epic will figure some of it out. This sub should get much better as well.

What do you think?

I’m not here to give unfair criticism. I want the game that I love to be fixed. What’s good for the game is good for the gamers, and in return is good for the developers. Epic is now worth over 8 billion dollars thanks to their Fortnite player base. They should be listening and responding to us, which they have been, until now. I’m sorry for those of you who think that’s okay, you are flat out wrong. This model of listening to your fanbase should be the standard for all game developers and not just the exception. For entirely way too long gamers have been screwed over by developers for simply not listening to us. The current META and the the current state of the game on XBOX are unacceptable. Plain and simple kids. It’s not acceptable. I myself have spent hundreds of dollars on Fortnite, and so have many of my close friends. Epic, you need to fix your game. Sorry not sorry. Believe me, when people start to say things like, it’s fine the way it is; that’s when games die. Destiny 2 (how well is D2 doing in comparison to D1 folks? Did Bungie listen?) was the last game I played before Fortnite, and I haven’t looked back since, but these past few weeks, I’ve been dying for a new game to come out because Fortnite in it’s current state is not worth playing. I was enjoying it before they nerfed the most important aspect of the game. Building is the game. It’s what players work towards getting better at. That’s the most rewarding part of the game. Outbuilding someone, gaining high ground, getting the kill. Now it’s focused on helping trash players get kills without putting in any time at all to focus on getting better, which is what myself and many others have done since season 1. Epic doesn’t need you to pat them on the back. They need constructive criticism. I know a lot of times you see whiny posts on here that are annoying, but welcome to the internet dude. There’s a lot of that. 

Also, it’s not entitlement if I spend $20 on a new skin, and $15 on the pickaxe and glider for that skin. I’m not asking them to fix the game, I’m literally paying for it.",FortNiteBR

2. It will segregate and isolate any complainers away from the majority of the community. 

3. It will allow Epic Games to focus on actual bugs and gameplay issues NOT related to weapon balance.

It's because PC players have an undeniable advantage over console players. And most of this advantage is due to the fact that PC players (almost) always use a keyboard + mouse setup, whereas console players use controllers. However, if you play from your console with a keyboard and a mouse, it's the same thing as if you were bypassing the platform limitations and playing on your pc against console players, which is a clear and, in my opinion, UNFAIR advantage.  
Some of you may wonder - ""so, should console players be forbidden from playing with KBM?"" -, but that's not what I'm saying. My suggestion is to match players depending on the external devices they're using - either KBM or controller -, either without or in addition to matching players by platform.  
Furthermore, someone may wonder - ""what if I start the game with a controller and switch mid-game to KBM?"". Simply, when you start the game with your controller the KBM keybindings get disabled, so you have to end the game in order to be able to switch to keyboard and mouse.",FortNiteBR

No one can argue that using a shotgun takes more skill and strategy overall. These high fire rate ""multi use"" weapons combined with the building nerf have essentially made AR's, shotguns, dual pistols and building irrelevant. More and more people are dropping scars for a drum gun or smg. The developers seemed to be worried about how much the shotguns were being used but now it seems as though the meta has been replaced with high fire rate weapons. 

It's gotten to the point where after i laser someone with a drum or smg I legitimately feel bad because I know there's nothing they could have done. 

If a decent player has a drum and an smg there's not much the other person can really do unless they have 1000+ materials. 

There's a lot of talk that they nerfed the mats and the shotguns to ""lower the skill gap"" but it seems like this new meta has only widened it even more. 

**My proposed solution:** Restore material health, re-adjust shotgun effectiveness, take out the drumgun and P90. The SMG and LMG seemed well balanced from the beginning. If removing the drumgun and P90 is too extreme then their reload time needs to be increased significantly. 

What are your proposed solutions to the current gameplay?",FortNiteBR

1. Fortnite is free. Battlefield and COD are AAA titles and will cost good money. 
2. Fortnite is well optimized and has ""bad graphics"" (bad= needing very low power). The game's console graphics is hard to differentiate from it's iPhone version graphics. That says a lot. The game would literally run on a toaster. BF and COD on the other hand would need gaming hardware and better Internet connection. 
3. Pay 2 win. We know what's coming with BF and COD.. Pay for upgrade, grind, shitty loot boxes. On the other hand, all microtranscations in Fortnite offer no in game advantage. 
4. Fortnite's pacing and fun element.. BF and COD on the other hand will ne be slower and more serious like PUBG. 
5. Inconsequential grinding rewards. There is not much reason to grind the game. No in game advantage, not much rewards. This gives casuals a good chance to play casually. 

So, you see this is why Epic is trying to cater to casuals and reduce skill gap.

The last few games of playground mode I have played have been a nightmare. I have played with my regular squad and random squads. 

I am seriously going to lose my mind over the “don’t pick up each others loot” nonsense. There have been multiple times when I jumped over someone and head shotted them, only to accidentally fall into their loot. I have no idea how much ammo or matts I accidentally collected and now the other players are loosing their cool with me. 

Not only that, people keep having these random rule changes like “no SMG’s, no RPG’s, no jet packs, etc” and by the end of the game I have no idea what the rules are.

My suggestion: 
Can we please have a settings menu before playground starts that allows us to select the settings we would like for the game. That way we can talk with our squad prior to going in to set everything up. The party leader will be the only one who can adjust these settings. 

Example:

Drop loot when eliminated : on/off

Allow selected weapons and items:
( multiple choice listed items or groups) 
RPG : on/off
SMG : on/off
Pistols : on/off
Etc

Unlimited ammo and mats: on/off


Now I know this may be a big suggestion and not everyone will agree, but playground mode is such a great addition to the game and I think it has potential to be absolutely amazing if we all talk about it more.

That's all there is to say. You are playing a FREE game and eviscerating the development team because it's not perfect. They are incredibly responsive for a gaming company (see: same day SMG hotfix) and are creating a game that never gets stale. Every season there is a new feature. Every WEEK there is a new feature. This is unprecedented.

The degree of entitlement this sub (as a whole) has and the things it believes it is owed (as a whole) is mind-boggling. You pay nothing for this game. If you are paying something, you are paying for skins, emotes, and harvesting tools - and they are delivering exactly what you are willingly paying for.

Shut up. Just SHUT UP. Fortnite is still fun, or else the vocal minority wouldn't still be fucking playing it. Voice your opinion and they will take it into consideration, then move on with your life. But grow up with this ""we need to rise up together and force them to make the exact changes that I want"" bullshit.

I’m not a fan of this constant battle of who’s the best at holding left click. I’m sure you’ve all died this way knowing that there is barely anything you can do to prevent it. 

At the same time, buff shotguns. Nobody carries double shotgun now so maybe just make it so you can only carry ONE. Like with the jetpack, you cannot carry 2 because the other will drop. This will make it so there is no need for a delay.

Pump should do 200+ dmg for a perfect headshot and it should shoot slightly faster.

NERF clingers/RPG.
If you are in a 1x1 healing.. perhaps after leaving the storm, if a clinger hits the OUTSIDE of your wall, roof, you will still get hit. Nothing u can do. RPGs literally destroys a 1x1 with a single rocket. Revert it back to when it destroyed the wall it hit but keep the delay and reload times slow.

There is also a delay with building pieces. Sometimes building pieces will stay visible even after being destroyed, causing confusion. Especially after being ‘sploded.

I understand not all of these changes will happen but in my opinion, this is what needs to be done. I miss the skill gap where it came down to who can hit their shots and who is the better builder, not who has the ability to hold left click down with an smg.

A lot of Samsung devices are able to be put on Desktop Mode which essentially lets you hook your device up to your computer. Now, I know that console players get frustrated when people use mouse and keyboard against them, but imagine using it against MOBILE players. This would give Samsung devices a HUGE advantage, and possibly ruin Fortnite Mobile.

My Suggestion: There are a few ways to not let this happen. I’m not that much of a techy guy, so I may be wrong. EPIC could either give Samsung players their own server, or not allow Samsung devices to play Fortnite on desktop mode? (Maybe idk)

I am just going to get straight to the point.

Why a ranked mode and how would that fix it? 
First of all we are all aware of the corrupt meta, and most of us know how it is affecting the playerbase; to those who do not know how, the current meta (including the building nerf) destroys the main concept of the game, and ruins gameplay for good/long term players.

What is so special with having a ranked gamemode?
Having a ranked mode does not just mean that its just another game called 'ranked', instead EPIC can apply exclusive settings to that game mode that would make it more competative; for example in this mode they have double shotgun, or they have greater structure health, or more matts from structures, more loot or less, less grenades and annoying other items. You see this mode can exlude real issues that for good/ long term players can see but issues that EPIC cannot see (they want bad players to have a fair/better chance. 

How would this affect Fortnite?
This would divert players who do not like building so much to play casual, understand the mechnaics, then move to the ranked mode. The circle goes on and on while still simultaneously welcome long existing players and new players.

Woudn't that split the playerbase or lead to empty servers, long queue times etc?
Seeing numerous games have way more gamemodes with much smaller playerbase, this wouldn't leave a scratch on Fortnite.

What advantages are there for EPIC?
Not only do you get to keep your plan to welcome new players and grow even further, it also encourages existing players that are good to keep playing, win win! 

What are the advantages for new/learning players?
You fellow players get to learn the basis of the game with people at similar level and play the game through EPIC's decisional meta that is welcome to players who are not so confident in building. 

What are the advantages for long existing players?
You guys get exclusive BR games that welcome the core game mechanics exluding annoying items or features the hinder competativeness.

TL;DR 
Why a ranked mode and how would that fix it? 
Allows new players to practice and play in the current meta.
Allows older/better players to play with exlusive competative settings such as more structure health etc...
Allows better growth for the Game
Encourages competative gameplay
Gives old players the ability to use their hardworking building skills.",FortNiteBR

Seriously guys. Stop ignoring these type of posts.

Are we really still having a blast playing this game? Are you playing this game like you were in Season 3-4? I know I’m not. I know my friends aren’t. This game use to be the jello, now it’s just sugar + water.

This games peak was towards the end of Season 3. Since then, each update has made this game gradually worse, and I’m sick of scrolling this sub and reading stuff like “LTM idea!” when the game in general is struggling.

Like seriously? We can’t even ADS without our character taking up half the screen and blocking what we’re shooting at, but we’re worried about a new “LTM idea!” ?

Our Guns are filled with Bloom, SMG and Explosives rule the meta, the Drum Gun is an AR, Sub, and Minigun put into one, and we’re concerned with “new battle-bus music!” ?

Enough with the new skin ideas, enough with the new game mode ideas, enough with the new trap ideas.

**JUST ENOUGH.**

Here’s an idea. How about we suggest this game fixes the problems that plague it?

We’re all gonna sit here and pretend this game is super fun huh? Until what, Call of Duty and Battlefield steals half the player base? All because we let the bottom half of the skill gap make this game a circus act, rather than what it was suppose to become? The funnest BR of them all, with an emphasis on building?

What had made this game gradually worse?

------ 

1.) **Spray and Pray:**

This game has gotten so much worse trying to address turtling, that it created an even bigger problem in itself than turtling ever was.

NO, Epic. Making SMGs as strong as they are was not the solution, it was more poison. The Drum gun has way too much utility for a single weapon. The Meta is seriously using a Drum gun as an AR, a Sub, and a MiniGun (as far as its effectiveness at destroying builds). I’m tired of seeing this gun be an absolute unit, with literally no skill to use it other than holding down the R-trigger.

------ 

2.) **War on building:**

“Beginning players aren’t good at building.”

Um,

WHO CARES.

When I first started this game, I couldn’t build a wall, ramp.

But.. (and here’s the kicker). I got BETTER.

I didn’t ask for Devs to change the whole FREAKIN game so that I could get a couple of cheeky kills at the expense of more experienced players. This is seriously such a dumb route to take.

To destroy what made you successful and different; building! I will never understand this thought process. No matter how much you try and appease to non-builders, you will never do it as good as Call of Duty or Battlefield will do it this fall.

Whether it’s lowering materials, Buffing explosives to the sky, or decreasing the starting hit points of builds while making guns like the Drum gun the best gun in the game. The war on building has got to STOP and we need to strike the balance we had in Season 3-4. Where the game was at its most fun.

------  

3.) **War on Shotguns**

Shotguns aren’t really under powered per say. But there was a clear path Epic took when removing double shotgun, and promoting/making SMGs a lot more viable utility wise and damage wise. The goal was to limit shotguns influence on the game. This was a terrible decision considering shotguns have a MUCH bigger skill gap to using than the spray and pray non-existent skill gap SMGs promote.

Quick edit on Shotguns:

Ok guys, I’m not suggesting that double pump was the ideal way CQC should have been. I’m not advocating for double shotgun, nor am I even saying I was a fan of double pump.

All I’m saying is that by removing double shotgun, the Devs clearly put more emphasis on reducing the influence shotguns had on the game, and promoting the spam SMG meta.

EVEN if you reinstate double shotgun, Pump switch to Drum gun would still be the meta, NOT double pump. The drum has too much utility use to not be meta. So even if double pump was still a thing, it would not be the most powerful combo in today’s meta, not even close.

With that being said, if the argument was that “double pump was too powerful”, by logical comparison, you should agree that Pump-Drum gun is just as much “too powerful” (cough and it’s not the pump making that combo too powerful cough).

------ 

4.) **Bad Camera angle when ADS:**



Just throwing this in. The fix to ghost peeking was welcomed, but this new ADS angle is not.

Change the FOV, make your body transparent. Do what you want, but do something. ADS is not suppose to be a random nuisance. Pretty sure this caused more of a problem than it fixed.

****
5.) **What happened to Directional Sound Overhaul?**

You commented back in Season 3 about how a directional sound overhaul was high on the list. What happened? It’s still bad. Did you guys scrap the project of overhauling the low-quality sound in this game in favor of working on projects like the Shopping Cart, Cool skins and emotes?

I’d like to think those can be mutually exclusive, but I’m starting to have doubts? It seems like you guys only have so many resources, and that leads to things being prioritized over others. Sound hasn’t changed though, especially directional sound. It’s not good. Probably one of Fortnites worst qualities compared to other games. You were right in an attempt to overhaul it. Keep with that decision, don’t put it on the back burner like it’s been for 2 seasons straight, the community loved that you recognized sound being an issue.

------ 

6.) **Shooting Tests:**

What happened to these?

You know the vast majority of people who know about bloom don’t like bloom. You use to fight with us by introducing shooting tests all in an effort to slowly reduce bloom in favor of lower damage and more predictable recoil. You didn’t overhaul the whole thing at once. You slowly did, with each shooting test, to make sure this game never went through drastic changes.

I miss the times where you guys constantly worked to improve the mechanics of the game itself, and not just about adding new things just to add new things.

New things can be nice, and trust me, I want battle bus music as much as the next guy, but we just miss Season 2-3 Epic spending more time improving the game that actually exists, rather than spending so much time trying to create the things that don’t exist yet.

------ 

7.) **Responding to our criticism like how it was a few months ago:**

Whenever there was a problem in the game, you know what made me and my friends keep playing despite it? The fact that you guys would respond saying “don’t worry, we know yada yada is a problem, stay tuned :)”

This kind of relief kept us playing, and made these problems less annoying, because we knew they were only temporary.

Nowadays, we’re left with mass uncertainty as to what this game will look like in the next 2 months. Is SMG and Explosive spam still gonna be the meta? Are SMGs going to get worse to deal with? Is building going to get worse?

A lot of us might not want to keep investing in this game if that’s the case. A lot of us keep playing because we’re holding on to hope that things will change, we used to get reassurances or at least comments by the Devs about what will and won’t, now the only things that get commented on are posts without criticism.

------ 

8.) **The actual quality of the game:**


Seriously, what happened? Maps don’t render. Huge lag spikes in the middle of the game. Huge frame rate drops out of the blue. Guns not switching. SMG not firing sometimes after switching from shotgun, builds not building randomly (especially floors), random animation glitches, Ghost footsteps, the game crashing mid game and having to restart..

There are so many bugs and glitches in the game, it almost feels like you guys are devoting a little too much time into creating new skins, and not enough time actually up-keeping the game itself. I can’t hop into a game without some weird bug showing up sometime through.

(At least on console)

This downgrade of quality of the game is directly comparable to when HiRez studios released Realm Royale. They spend a huge amount of time trying to work on that game, their other game SMITE got way more buggy, laggy, and just in general; worse.

Are you guys spending your time in Season 6? Trying to come up with new guns? Whatever it is, delay the season if you have to. The game itself needs some work.

If we as players keep ignoring posts like these. Then we deserve this path we’re going down since the last 5-6 updates. Sit here and act like it’s all a coincidence, but there is a war on the skill gap in this game, and everyone ends up reaping what they sow.",FortNiteBR

Whenever EPIC makes drastic changes to the game WHITHOUT WARNING there is always huge backlash from the community. The solution I propose to this is for EPIC to create something akin to the Overwatch PTR or Public Test Realm . 

For those not familiar with Overwatch the PTR is a testing ground where the devs have the community try out changes and give there  feedback and opinions on said changes before they are implemented into the actual game effecting the entire playerbase.

The Positives:

Summarized Version : It would give Epic a test group of sorts where they could test changes made to gunplay, building, and balancing while receive community feedback and opinions (So sort of like the shooting tests they have done but more  malleable  and larger in scale). Allowing for slight changes instead of what happened with season 5 and the First Shot Accuracy update

1. Gives Epic devs more freedom to make more risky and creative plays without the fear of having the community be at there throat

2. There would a ton of people who'd help look for bugs and glitches in the game making it easier for epic to identify and fix glitches and bugs caused by new updates before they go live. 

3. Fans could give there feedback on the new balance changes and weapons so something like the OG Compact Smg and OP C4 don't occur ever again

4. It would be a way for the devs to be more open with the community about what they want to do with the gunplay and the game mechanics.

5. Overall promotes a healthier relationship between Epic and there fans

Negatives:

1. Slower patches/updates instead of 1 a update every week it could be an update every other or maybe every three weeks possibly longer (But the updates would be more exciting and more refined )

2. There would be a need to dedicate manpower to maintaining the PTR and listening to the feedback aswell . (Manpower is taken away from other dev teams who work on the game or more has to be brought in from other places)

I apologize for the huge wall of text I tried to keep it as thorough and straight forward to the point as I could. If you have any ideas or critiques you want to share I would be more than happy to listen.

1. In mid to late game I always ponder about my loadout because everything seems so viable. The pink/legendary burst assault rifles are just great, same goes for scar they often compete for a slot. Shotguns are great, even after the nerf I cannot bring myself to not run a blue tac/purple/legendary shotgun. But they always compete for a loadout place with the SMG, if I run both I have to decide whether I go for sniper or explosives.

I don't want to run 5 weapons, at least 1 slot for consumables should be saved. So if there is a lot of lot I am almost always in a dilemma. Shotgun/SMG/AR/BurstAR/Sniper/GrenadeLauncher/Rocketlauncher.

Back when I started (S3 space season) it was easy get a shotgun (or 2), take an AR, Sniper or Explosives, if you didn't play double pump just take everything and you got the perfect loadout.

2. I really dig the explosives buff combined with the rocket ammo nerf. Now C4 might even be more viable then picking a rocket launcher, gone are the times of being spammed with 20+ rockets in a rapid succession. Nobody would pick C4 over rocket launcher back then.

3. 1hit accuracy&amp;bloom&gt;spraypatterns (unpopular opinion ouch)

Why? 1 hit accuracy is a great tool, it's simple and easy to understand, you are rewarded for exact aiming and shooting in the right rhythm which can be easily adjusted and buffed/nerfed. It punishes people whose aim is slightly off, and rewards those who can keep their cool in a stressfull situation. 

It is way more balanced than spray patterns, those reward sweating bullets, and while the aim still has to be good (and the muscle memory) it's not a problem if you miss a few shots because you just empty your clip at max speed, while still having a lot of accuracy which can lead to insanely unfair DPS and encourages emptying your clip the fastest.

Apart from being a bit of a grind to learn spray patterns it is also intransparent for players of non CS:GO shooters. If you are happy about emptying your clip the fastest why not remove recoil and bloom altogether, the people with the best aim are still rewarded (you still have to aim for their head/body for max dps), and it get's rid of the insanely unreal and intransparent mechanic of adjusting your spray to a constant recoil/spray pattern of your weapons. (Consistent spray patterns are just illogical, for ARs etc.)

5. Traps are great again Yey (remember the 75 dmg traps, they were useless).
Also the bouncepads are great and a lot of fun.

6. Ok no shit the material+buildinghp nerf was really a bad combination, mats are at an all time low and they are not very viable. I get it they want to encourage different playstyles so they just nerfed all Bob the Builders. It's stuppid tho, insane build skills could have often been countered by building up a bit and sneaking out, the other guy will continue building and you are already 50m away lining up some great shots, or destroying the base.

If they wanted to nerf building, a fall damage increase would also have been an idea to encourage different playstyles, just my 2'cents.

Anyway with recent trends this will probably be downvoted into oblivion, I just wanted to share my playgroups take on the things.

Which made me think, with this and new releases in the fall, could fortnite die?
However after some thinking and analysis I have come to the conclusion that fortnite won't    die until a major event happens to destroy it's playerbase. 

First of all I'm going to go over why fortnite is so big right now and how it came to be the biggest video game of all time

1. The battle royale phenomenon- In 2017 battle royale games took off. They were the in thing to be playing. We saw this with the rise of pubg and later on fortnite. However in my opinion the battle royale phenomenon is dying. Think about it, when you go to play fortnite you don't care about surviving. You care about kills and winning. When everyone was a noob all they cared about was surviving. That is true battle royale, survival.

2. Accessibility- when fortnite was first released it was seen as a pubg clone, a rip off to be ignored. But when it got ten million players in two weeks people began to notice it. Without free to play millions of people would have never tried the game therefore hampering it's growth and stopping it from exploding into to what it is today. On top of that the game being 12 rated meant that it was open to a large child audience that pubg never got access to. And to top it all off it beat pubg to console release.

3. Weekly updates- However the previous two things would have been meaningless if it wasn't for the ultimate tool that fortnite used to remain relevant, weekly updates. I assure you that without weekly updates fortnite would have faded away along time ago. The reason people keep coming back is because of weekly updates. I hope you get the message WEEKLY UPDATES ARE SO IMPORTANT.

So now I'm going to go over why new games will not be able to challenge fortnite. So first any new battle royale game will fail because it will lack the three things that made fortnite big in the first place. Blacks ops 4 without a single player mode will never be able to mount a challenge to fortnite. Other new games will maybe take a small percentage of fortnites playerbase but these players will keep coming back to try the new fortnite updates. This brings me to my next point.

If people get bored of fortnite?

People are getting bored of fortnite you say? Oh look here's a new update to get them back into the game! Oh look new challenges for them to do! Bored? Look new update!!!...
This cycle is why fortnite will struggle to ever die it has perfected the cycle of getting people to play the game. If this continues the only way fortnite could ever die is if a new game type becomes big a game is created that uses the fortnite formula and pulls in a playerbase large enough to destroy fortnites.

So  these are my reasons why fortnite can't die. I would like to hear your thoughts in the comments. And hopefully we can spark a discussion over this",FortNiteBR

Lemme start by saying human beings are inherently selfish. They don’t want what’s the best for the community they always want what’s best for them. Take politics for example, racial and religious demographics are the best indicators of who one will vote for. Why? Because political parties tries to cater to certain ethnicities to show that they have their back. Nobody cares about their policies, just stance. 

That being said, the Players here are no different and that makes sense of course. The players here, including me, have likely been playing since season 1 and 2 and have got really good at the game. In earlier season it meant they have become particularly good at building and at using shotguns. Shotguns were pretty much the only choice in the beginning stages. 

As the game grew, it made sense to give people with different skills more choices. Such as players who can track an enemy really well. Hence the SMGs. They got off to an overpowered start but were hence brought into balance. To provide more detail on this: the grey SMG has a higher DPS than the blue drum gun, now the gold P-90 does LESS damage than the green drum gun. (Drum guns might still be a tad too powerful but that’s another topic) 

Anyways, coming back to the topic, the older players who consist majority of this reddit have become slightly worse when in comparison. Therefore, naturally they want to revert to the old stages where they were slightly better. In my opinion, these changes have been good for the community. I don’t think SMGs cater to worse players. You still need to track your opponent and that requires as much skill as get a few accurate shots. 

Drawing on another trait from politics, one of the biggest indicators of who will get elected in a democracy is who was elected earlier.

People are never happy. Over time the chances of the ruling party continuing keep decreasing even if they do a good job. Grass always looks greener on the other side. This is similar to people complaining about the game no matter what happens. When shotguns were the only option people complained. Now that there are other options, people still complain. And this is not just natural but kind of expected.

TLDR: Objectively speaking, the game is headed in a good direction with most things. There are shortcomings as there are with all things but it is still one of the best and the most fun games out there. Cheers! ",FortNiteBR

**Building**

In general, I hate multiplayer games in which you only have to shoot the other guy. It doesn't suit me, staying at place isn't fun and it's even annoying when you get killed by a camper, so I never really bothered do dive into CoD MP or any other stuff like that before Fortnite. Building makes this game different. You can pull a defense up while your opponent can do so as well, and each and every building structure is destructible. I didn't build in the beginning, and I still struggle with it a lot, but some random high ground building can confuse the enemy, like all the time. Those few who actually know what they are doing, well yeah, they just wreck me in no time, but that happens like...it never happened before, I'm not so lucky to fight against pro players. Anyways, this mechanic needs to be relevant in the game. Right now, it takes a lot more time than before to gain sufficient materials for long term survival. I remember Tilted being destroyed by 1 good person who could build. He could clear the entire city (15 other people) before getting exhausted on mats and dying to a slowy looting player like me. Nowadays they only manage to get 6 kills in most cases because having no mats on the streets is like instant death. 

The point is that I, just like others, improved in building, it is completely learnable. Some people will always find next level bullshit to expand their kit of tricks, but leave that to them. The base of it can be learned, it's all about game experience. After a certain amount of time, everyone will have the necessary skills to be good. There will always be newbs since the player base is growing all the time if I'm not mistaken.

**The way the weapon meta was taken care of**

Before season 5, we had a setup of shotguns/smg for close range, assault rifles for mid range and snipers for long range. One could choose between explosives and healing items as a utility item. Back then, the problem was the poor design of weapon swap. It could be exploited for fire rate improving purposes with the heavy and pump action shotguns. Without delays, a shotgun ready to shoot was always at the ready by pressing the appropriate hotkey. Yes, it was a bit disgusting damage-wise and methodically as well, but it did take some skill to master it. Epic's solutions for this problem was ridiculous. Initially we had a pumping animation, but just like in other games, it could be cancelled as soon as the animation begun. Yikes. And then came the damage nerfs and the pullout delay. I personally felt happy about the damage reduction because shotgun consistency only became a thing with the season 5 update. Before that the scale of pellet spread was way too wide and it was far worse in the tactical shotgun's case. I had 2 identical fights ending with the same shot. Once I landed a 160 damage headshot from an impossible angle, the other time I dealt 14 damage with the same shot. The delay wasn't such a bad idea, but spamming left click and swapping guns after shooting is an easier method than timing the animation cancel perfectly. Anyways, even I accepted double pump in the end, and I even used it because for some reason I could always dish out more, than 60 damage per shot, and that meant I could win a fight in 3 shots because I could aim at their heads.

The other way was shotgun and tactical smg. If the pump shot dealt max damage, it was fairly easy to finish with the tac smg, so it took some skill to land a very good pump shot. Tactical shotgun was a gamble, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't. 

FSA helped for anyone who knew how to hitscan with assault rifles, thanks to the 50v50 mode, I improved a lot and became accurate with hitscan FSA.

Snipers were always the same, if they crouch peek at you, crouch peek back. I usually was the smarter, and they lost their potential in these fights.

Season 5 removed double shotgun, brought shotgun consistency, and *didn't remove pump pullout delay.* I mean, fine, we could use tactical shotguns way more effectively (my first game brought me 8 kills, one for each shot in the tac), a more trustworthy pump for pump+tac smg. However, pumps now have that delay that makes no sense. Epic finally did the proper change to stop double shotguns: they implemented a cooldown so nobody can use two shotguns right after each other for a while. The pump delay makes edit plays less relevant as well, since you can build a wall to seal your target, but he will see the structure being edited, and a shotgun being flung over, while he can simply shoot you in the process. I know that timing is important, but edit plays were fun, even if I was the guy about to be killed (I had a few tricks in my kit lol). 

Then came the smg changes. the suppressed smg turned into a better hitscan FSA gun than most of the assault rifles, which is absurd if we think about range conditions and real effectiveness. Whatever, I could live with that (I almost never found a suppressed smg after that patch). And then the game turned into a spammy gun madness. The tommy gun, the smg, and now the P90 are all about holding left click, emptying your gun and hoping to kill the enemy. Wow. The high fire rate guns also cripple buildings, and they have explosives to destroy stuff even more efficiently. Again, yikes. Compared to spammy guns, using double pump was harder. I didn't like the method, but I appreciated the time it took to get used to it.

As for responsiveness, Epic does the very thing one could do with any explosive: they turtle in, and wouldn't say a thing. I mean I would have been much more relaxed if I had known at the end of season 4 that they are working on shotgun consistency. But no, they silently released the patch, and then we saw in the patch notes that actually they did notice the issue.

**Current issues**

Right now, the game struggles a lot. I have a 7th gen intel i7 processor and an nvidia gtx 1050 ti graphics card, yet my game performs badly on MEDIUM settings. the map render isn't a common issue for me luckily, but my friends keep saying that they are in trouble since they are already in the house which didn't even render for them. There are huge fps drops in 50v50 like all the time, the lobby loads incredibly slowly, and there are packet losses at the worst times possible. Like, I shoot a rocket and it leaves the terrain (seemingly), while I deal 200+ damage to my target, but then it becomes fractured since my rocked did half the job already. My internet connection is fine whenever I do anything else than playing Fortnite. Unless it is a severe fortnititis that spreads through the internet, I have to assume that there are connection issues on the other end as well. Feels like my game can't communicate well with the server. Replay mode should show the game as it's been registered on the server, otherwise I can't be sure if the connection issue was on my side, or on the server's side. There was a replay once as I've been sniped from 300+m. The replay showed my assassin aiming at a spot I was at like a minute ago. He shot that spot, and I died. I don't really care who's end is to be blamed, but there are connection&amp;stability issues that must be solved, because at this state it just ruins the game.

Vertical sound - this is still a joke. I mean, there was a time I could tell if my enemy was right above/below me, but that's it. Last time I was in Tilted I heard 5 identical footstep sounds, and one of them was right behind me. Volume is inconsistent as well, since everyone lands so damn loud that it's hard to not notice, and it's awkward when I shoot at my teammate. I die so many times because I just hear a thud as someone lands, I'm used to that being my teammate since his footsteps wouldn't be loud, and then I get lasered. Fun.

TL,DR: There are stability issues that need a fix, the meta is playable, but it's not fun, Epic wouldn't respond at all.",FortNiteBR

I started playing fortnite 16 days ago and its one of the most incredible games i've ever played. I've played League for 8 years and no game has made me stop playing that game until I hopped on fortnite. I've quit league now for it. I'm drawn to games that have high skill ceiling and hard to master mechanics, that's the reason why I played league for so long, it takes a long time to master and I find that very appealing. As soon as I tried building and being in a fight, the difficulty of that combination immediately hit me. The building mechanic really differentiates this game to all other games. Beating your opponent is not only about aim sometimes but outsmarting him by outbuilding like a game of chess, that makes this game incredible to me as soon as I tried it.

I keep track of my progress here, watch as I improve :

This is definitely not the first or last post about the new meta. I don’t want to flood this subreddit with these posts. But, I can’t stand playing these game anymore. You have to admit, it was fun for the first few days. When you could get kills with SMG’s and it was like trying out something new. Keyword: First few days. 

There is no need to change the meta, when that is what made the game popular. Building and Shotguns were the meta. They were the meta for the past 4 seasons while Fortnite raised to be a great game. You made hundreds of millions of dollars Epic, you broke gaming records and twitch records, and you had a strong community. Close to nobody is enjoying the game as we once did. Epic makes statements such as double pumps aren’t as skillful. There is no way this new meta with 50 clip smg is skillful.

Double pump was fun. It wasn’t easy to master and use, but it was fun. This is the skill gap that Epic is taking out of factor. Epic wants to see Fortnite as a competive E-sport, while holding back the capabilities of the pro players. 

I’ve been playing this game since the week it came out. I’ve seen things come and go, strategies change, building evolve, and each day more and more crazy plays. This game is personal to some people, and some people have made a living off of this game. So please Epic, chance this around for the better!

They need to buff the shitguns back to their original state when they were good. I like how shit the shitguns are I call them shitguns. Every time epic talks about shotgun nerfs I wanna make my own custom skin that says, “A slut would make a better weapon than a shotgun!” That’s what I think about them. 




Also, Epic is so brain dead they don’t understand what a cluttered map is. The map is so cluttered with viable landing spots and tilted towers that almost nobody lands at the OG cities such as Pleasant, or retail. 



This game is so boring it’s only playable for 1-2 hours at a time. This is becaus when ur such a good builder versing players who are intimidated at you, they edit to the bottom of the build and they destroy it. This is very apparent when it at the end of games and people want to win 






Early game mats are so annoying. I can hardly get any materials if I want to go and kill people. My aim isn’t the greatest. So I rely on building to give myself an advantage. With the nerf to mats, I find it more difficult to get out of early game. 




Epic is a good developer but need to listen to the community more. I would guess that all of us would rather have all of the shitguns buffed and the smgs nerfed. We don’t want new content. We want balance. I find that they add so many new things, they are forgetting about what the game really needs. A skill gap. 




Nobody likes dusty divot. Please just remove it. It’s so bullshit when you are in the divot and someone is camping on the edge of it. You could just build, but they have cover that dosnt break so you have no chance to shoot back when building at them. This is because they can just hide on the edge of the creator. 



Nerf the amount of loot in tilted. This is because nobody land anywhere else anymore. Or you could remove some of the locations to open the map up more and make it easier to get more kills when not landing at tilted. 



Somehow. Nerf third partying. I don’t enjoy playing solos and have to fight two people at the same time. 



Make the game progress in a way that leaves more players in the end game. I know this contradicts what I said in the last topic. But you know what I mean. 




Stop making upgradeable skins in the battle pass. This has really deterred me from buying the season 5 pass I bough the season 4 pas sand regret doing it. It encourages extreme grinding and tryharding. I find I just want to be casual and avoid comp players. Also if you don’t get max of the tier 100 skin, I feel like i wasted money because I never got the “full package” of the battle pass.  




Add a ranked and casual game mode for solos duos and squads. This would help the amount of try Harding. Make it so ranked gives more xp and has rewards other than the wining screen. This would also stop stream sniping a little bit. Some people might care about ranked stats and won’t stream snipe as much.

For example, how is double pump not more skilled than double P90s? They dont even take aim. At least double pump took some sort of skill and practice. Idk maybe people dont agree with me but regardless Epic needs to really sit back and review what theyve done to their game. Maybe try doing balances for what the skilled community wants rather than lowering the skill gap with a new spammable weapon every patch. Anyone can sit there and hold W and spray a 50 round clip. But shotguns take aim. ARs are in a weird place too. The amount of times I shoot at a still player just to have my bullets form a circle around their body are too much to count. It feels like any new player can come into a solo match and have a decent chance to kill someone whose been practicing and playing the game for 5 months. I dont feel like this game fulfills skilled players. The only reason players like Ninja and Dae even play is for the prize money Epic has for tournaments. Theyve admitted to it. No game survives by appealing to the lesser skilled players. Thats why games like CSGO or League of Legends or Dota 2 are still very relevant is because they are competitive. They take time and practice to be good and thats why people play it. To get better. Right now this game feels like there is no skill gap and thats no way to treat fans that have bene around since the beginning. Anyways if you read it this far thanks and let me know how you feel if you agree or disagree!",FortNiteBR

Have you ever stopped and wondered why you don’t see extravagant build battles anymore? We used to complain about people turtling in their bases but now there is no hope to protect yourself. Wood walls are basically just paper when you place them which results in a tragic death as you desperately try to build to cover yourself from incoming fire. Pushing is the same. No one with a sane mind even dares to try and take high ground more than four tiles up because it’s almost a guarantee that your building will be shot down in a matter of seconds even with double ramp quad stair double wall strat. It’s absolutely horrendous. I don’t know about you but I fell in love with this game because of the nearly unlimited combat uses for building. Now there is slim to none and I don’t think epic cares at all. Very sad can we get ten likes for children with leukaemia ,FortNiteBR

When a shotgun is aimed precisely it beats the SMG at close range. Just like how a precisely aimed sniper beats an AR in mid and long range.

SMGs are more forgiving but they dont beat out perfectly aimed shotgun shots. Just like how ARs are more forgiving but they don't beat out a perfectly placed sniper shot.

I honestly don't understand what everyone is crying so hard over. This IMO is the healthiest relationship the Shotguns have had with SMGs in the game entire existence.

The real imbalance is the drum gun being able to do the LMG's job and some of an AR. That is the real imbalance IMO. The rest of the SMGs and Shotguns are fine as is.

One think that I liked about fortnite was the fact that it wasn't spray and pray I used to play COD and the best weapons were usually smgs but when I started playing fortnite in season 2 it was all about tagging the OP from far with my are then building closer to finish my OP with a well placed pump shot. This is why I played fortnite.

https://i.redd.it/6efy4h2taee11.png

It hit me like a ton of bricks--I had been hacked.

To add a bit of context, I have been playing Fortnite Battle Royale on PS4 with this account for a long time. I have a lot of rare skins including Skull Trooper, Renegade Raider, Crackshot, every battle pass skin dating back to season 1, lots of dances, gliders etc. Needless to say I've dropped money on this game, which makes me a target.

I was in shock. I attempted to log into my Epic Games account and sure enough I was locked out. A quick search revealed that Epic doesn't allow you to change the email address associated with the account, which was great news for me. All I had to do was click ""Forgot my password"" to regain control. If I used the same password for both my Gmail/Epic accounts this would be a different story. The hacker could have accessed my Gmail and effectively locked me out of both.

After a quick password reset, I logged in to find that my display name had been changed as well!

https://i.redd.it/6y0kb29uaee11.png

Now this fucker is smart, but he's also an idiot. After searching his name, I was able to find his [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/apdurker) channel and [twitter](https://twitter.com/VaporDurker) within seconds. To top it off, the kid posted evidence of himself playing on the account with his face [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/293594082). I'm not one for witch hunts, but this piece of shit needs to learn a lesson and get called out for what he did.

After logging into Epic and re-linking my PS4 account, I decided to check in game and see if there was any additional damage done. Hate the PS4 store all you want, but having my credit card info saved through Playstation and not Epic potentially kept the hacker from racking up in game purchases. This would have caused a ton of headaches with refunds etc.

The reason why I'm posting this is to raise awareness about password security and hopefully help someone out if they find themselves in a similar situation. I cannot stress the importance of having a secure password. Do not share passwords across multiple sites and enable two factor authentication wherever possible (especially with your Epic account). You could get hacked, and you might not be as lucky as I was.",FortNiteBR

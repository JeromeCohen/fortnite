It started off well ,I went to the Fortnite-account merging-website and merged my Nintendo switch account with my PC account.
Until here everything is going well,it said in top right corner when launching the game that it will take t-14 to complete the process.
Now, I should have had my skins as of today...
But instead the timer on the top right disappeared.
Well now what.
I have contacted Epic Games Support about my problem but they told me that I never account merged, which isn't remotely true.

So confused.,"Months ago while adding coworkers as friends on fortnite they told me that my username was appearing as a totally different name which I thought was odd. Then weeks later I noticed while trying to play on my phone that my username was wrong in the lobby above my players head. It was the same name as my co-workers told me. Turns out this was an epic account created by my roommates old college roommate, Years ago. How this got attached to my Xbox and my epic name I have no idea. (My roommate does have his Xbox gamertag loaded onto my Xbox but not this random name that showed up). This is something I can't figure out for the life of me. Any ideas?? 

Second weird thing... This morning, log in and start playing and am booted right after landing and the message said ""login expired or logged in elsewhere"". Could this be related?? Been a year playing under the same username and Xbox gamertag and never had this message. Could have something to do with the fact that I logged in a few weeks ago and my skin was completely different, customized to a random number and NFL team that I never use and a few other things were changed. I changed them back and didn't think much of it. Is this related?? Emailed epic and didn't hear back... Any ideas??",FortNiteBR

No matter what you say, there‚Äôs at least 3 toxic children in a thread waiting to berate you because they disagree. 

I remember when the hand cannon was OP as hell and was one shotting wood structures. Bring attention to this and instead of people at least considering what you have to say, you‚Äôre branded as somebody who complains and your opinion is automatically terrible. The next week? Epic nerfs the hand cannon and suddenly everybody is applauding them and the same people berating you are now saying that this change was well needed. Are people not allowed to make suggestions? Probably not. 

Now let‚Äôs go to other aspects of the game. You know that ridiculous trap glitch that‚Äôs going on? You know, one of the worst glitches that‚Äôs been in the game in almost 3 seasons? Well if you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, traps have a tendency to double up, go through walls, etc. you destroy one, and there‚Äôs probably another right underneath. Sounds like bs, right? Well if you post a clip of you dying to this trap glitch saying it needs to be fixed, guess what? You‚Äôll be met with a bunch of toxic children calling you an idiot for dying in the first place. When you bring up the fact that it shouldn‚Äôt exist, people tell you to stop complaining. I guess we‚Äôre not allowed to say anything negative about glitches either, huh?  I‚Äôm dumb for walking into a trap because I thought it was a visual glitch? No! You‚Äôre dumb for insinuating that it was a legitimate way to die and that I‚Äôm complaining about a legitimate problem! 

Last but not least, I made a post about how the shield siphon was reverted as an intention to stop aggressive play, right? I posted a clip of me in a regular solo (got deleted because lol mods) and I was in a 1v1 fight. As in shooting a guy, I get sniped from my right and I start to build. As soon as I start building I get shot from 4 different directions and I quipped that aggressive play styles and third partying are even worse without the siphon and guess what? I was told to stop complaining. Apparently a thousand posts a day about the siphon is okay but making a clip showcasing the problem that epic was worried about means I‚Äôm complaining...Er okay. 

Here‚Äôs an idea, consider other people‚Äôs opinions and don‚Äôt immediately say they‚Äôre complaining. If you‚Äôre defending a trap glitch then honestly, you shouldn‚Äôt be posting on this sub. It‚Äôs willful ignorance and partial arrogance to the idea that *you* can‚Äôt be wrong and that you‚Äôre better than everyone else. This mentality needs to stop. The game won‚Äôt improve if the idiots on this sub refuse to acknowledge legitimate issues with the game.

If siphon were enabled, more compettive players would be playing in pubs.  i believe that even i would have too big of an advantage over newer players and more casual players with siphon, and i'm really not that good.

Bear with me here, I know there have been waaaaay too many posts claiming to have the entire story solved, but trust me, I've got a lot of stuff here that you haven't heard of.

#First Things First

If you haven't seen the entire story of Canny Valley (from S·¥õ·¥°), **please do.** Watch these 3 videos before continuing, it's actually really entertaining:

- **ACT 1** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CP0kxfOpprA

- **ACT 2** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcWWr27kPos

- **ACT 3** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcO8sQcWm-s

#Alright, done? In case you didn't know, *the cube is the storm.*

That's right, the cube is the storm. It is the same energy, the same evil. The cube is the power source for the corrupted water vapor known as ""The Storm"".

#The Timeline of the Cube

[**Please look at this image for a complete understanding of the timeline of the cube.**](https://i.imgur.com/KeUIA0v.png)

(Twine Peaks refers to the final area of S·¥õ·¥° that does not currently have a story or unique biome, meaning it is incomplete.)

#How the Fortnite ~~Universe~~ Multiverse Works

So we've got three dimensions: X, Y, and Z. We also have one dimension for time. The fourth dimension (time) can be moved through like the first three, however, normal humans have not found a way to do that on any useful scale.

We'll get back to that stuff later.

If there are multiple universes, what's *in-between* them? Does that area count as a 3D space? If so, is this ""in-between"" a universe itself? Who cares! There's a cool little place called- you guessed it- ""The In-Between""! [(canon name btw)](https://i.imgur.com/FsD6XUh.png)

[Here's an explanation of the in-between on a 2D scale.](https://i.imgur.com/gW9rKmV.png)

Going into the rifts (or if you want to sound cool, ""in-between gateways"") is unpredictable. Remember, your phone screen isn't supposed to be cracked. While they do allow travel, going into a random space crack in the middle of nowhere does not usually have
good effects on your health (note the fall from skydiving height) compared to stabilized ones, like the portals in Wailing Woods.

Normal rifts and the small portals that were in Wailing Woods *do* have one thing in common though: They both spit you out immediately. So I think that however long you stay in the in-between when you enter a rift depends on how large it is. The rocket took a few tries
before it made a fracture big enough to enter the in-between without being spat out.

In the in-between, space-time isn't very consistent and moving around in that ""space"" might also move you around in time.

There is a misunderstanding that after the butterfly event, we went into a new timeline. **This is not true**, it is simply the aftermath of the cube's explosion. [***Proof***](https://i.imgur.com/zvP5MBa.png)

The writers at Epic have almost certainly put together at least a basic guideline for how this entire multiverse is pieced together and the whole thing with the butterfly shows that.

#Story Time!

Now that you understand how the Fortnite multiverse works, it's finally time to tell the story so far, from start to finish.

Here we go!

#Pre-Story

From Pre-Season to Season 2, Fortnite did not have any significant story. We'll skip this part.

#A Little Speck in the Sky

Near the end of Season 3, a bright blue comet appeared in the sky. Over time, it got closer and closer until meteorites were hitting the island.

#Brace for Impact

Season 4 starts off with a bang, literally. The comet has landed in the middle of the map, spawning stones around the divot called ""Hop Rocks"". Not much is known about this weird element, but it may be related to the cube. In an attempt to distract the public from the strange *visitor* inside the comet, the government creates a superhero movie. You shouldn't really care about the movie, it doesn't do much for the story. Meanwhile, The Visitor has escaped from his pod that was hidden inside the comet. He moves to the villain base that was used for the movie and turns the rocket (that was supposed to be a *movie prop*) into a real one using hop rocks that the government was supplying him with. (Because, apparently, the prop worked pretty well as an actual rocket.)

#The Visitor Takes a Shortcut

Instead of using up fuel by flying all the way to his home planet, The Visitor utilizes the in-between to sorta ""cheat"" and take a shortcut to his destination. It takes a few tries, but he eventually makes a gateway big enough to allow him to travel fully into the in-between and back home. (We're not sure if he made it, hopefully, he did.)

#Then Comes the Consequences

Turns out, this guy didn't care about what he left behind. Now we've got this giant crack, and it's expanding. It managed to make a link to an anomaly in The California Desert and teleport the in-game Durr Burger sign into our universe. That's right, the one we all live in.

So there's other random stuff appearing all around the world, like llamas and police cars in the Fortnite art style! Sadly, it ended in a failed ARG. :(

The tomato head on top of Uncle Pete's Pizza also got teleported back in time. Goodbye, tomatohead... for now. ü§î

#Worlds Collide

At the start of Season 5, the anomaly linking our dimension with Fortnite's dimension closed. All of the ""reality hiccups"" start sucking everything back in, but an unlucky fellow nicknamed ""Drift"" decides to vandalize the Durr Burger sign at the wrong time and is brought into the world of Fortnite, along with stuff like loads of sand from the desert, a viking village from the past, and strange stone heads all over the map.

3 characters meet Drift as soon as he is dropped in: Rex, Cuddle Team Leader, and Brite Bomber. Their adventures aren't significant to the story very much, but I do want to mention that Brite Bomber got that **D**~~^rift~~, if ya know what I mean.

In mid-august, the rift started to shrink. Eventually, it turned purple and emitted a strange metallic sound when aimed at. At the same time, a temple that was built thousands of years ago for the one and only tomatohead was teleported into the map.

#The Arrival of the Cube

[**Please watch this video for an explanation on how the cube arrived.**](https://streamable.com/5gqez)

After multiple strange lightning strikes from the rift, a giant purple cube emerged and the rift collapsed.

Not too long after the arrival of the cube, it began to *roll*. Yep, for some reason, the all-powerful cube decided that the best way to move around was to ROLL. As a CUBE.

^(In case you didn't know, cubes kinda suck at rolling)

Anyway, little by little, the cube rolls to its first pit-stop near Fatal Fields.

#Stage 1 of the Cube's Plan

The cube begins the first step of its plan to take over Athena by burning strange runes into the ground. These runes leave behind large domes with a low gravity effect.

Over time, 6 more runes are printed all over the map. Eventually, the cube reaches Loot Lake... and melts into it? Yep, the cube melts like a bath bomb into Loot Lake, making the entire surface behave like the cube for 5 days before season 6.

#Darkness Rises

...Literally. The cube has re-formed underground and pushed the middle island of Loot Lake into the sky, creating a cool-looking floating island with a vortex of wind surrounding it. This vortex creates a whirlpool that drains water into a weird portal.

Not much is known why this portal exists, but the real question is: **How does ~~Loot~~ Leaky Lake have an inifinite supply of water? O_O /s**

Meanwhile, all of the runes have corrupted the area around them and spawned little shards of the cube called ""Shadow Stones"". These stones could be consumed for the ability to turn invisible and float through walls.

#Stage 2

The floating island begins moving from its original location, towards every single rune. Powering them up one by one, the cube finally makes it to the rune near the center of the map and begins summoning all the other 6 runes towards it. After extracting power from them, the island
returns to Leaky Lake and starts emitting a strange light in the sky.

This strange light started to expand until it turned into what looked like a portal.

#Fortnitemares / Stage 3

After the portal has finished opening, the cube decides to blow up the floating island into 3 pieces. (You know, for some breathing room.)

Using the portal to transport ""Cube Monsters"" all over the map, it plans to rid Athena of all humans.

Near the end of Fortnitemares however, it appears the people have fought back against the cube and are breaking it away, piece by piece until it ~~pisses itself~~ starts leaking energy into the hole below.

#The Butterfly Effect

After the last drop of energy is gone, and people are wondering why it happened at 1:01 instead of 1:00, the cube begins to spin. It spins faster and faster until it glows white before eventually exploding, sending a shockwave and blinding light all across the island. For a second, there's nothing. But then...

***Every single person from every single game of Fortnite Battle Royale is transported to The In-Between.***

[**Those aren't stars, those are people. Millions of people.**](https://i.imgur.com/2d4Cb5p.png)

Talk about worlds collide! Different sounds can be heard while in this area, but one that a lot of people notice is [the rocket siren.](https://instaud.io/3wng) (Useless note: I can confirm that the rocket siren is a seperate file outside the Butterfly event folder.)

While in the in-between, a lot of unsettling sounds from conflicting timelines can be heard before finally being teleported back. We come back to see that the pieces of the floating island have all beem thrown to the side, parts of the cube are on the ground, and the lake has completely drained... about time. üòí

#A New Anomaly?

As we mourn Kevin's death, a strange cloud can be seen in the distance. It appears to be an ice storm of some kind.

Temperatures are declining and the ice storm is getting closer. Upon closer inspection, it appears to be a giant iceberg!

Many theorize that the iceberg appeared due to a rift. After all, those things seem to be the only reason weird stuff happens anymore.

Assuming this is true, the iceberg comes from a funny dimension where Santa is literally a buff war veteran who could pick you up and snap your spine in half if he wanted to... I'm not complaining.

#Polar Peak

The iceberg has collided with the island and added about 20% more landmass. Inside the iceberg sits a castle covered in snow.

Over the next weeks, the snow melted away to reveal the castle. Then, the iceberg itself began to melt.

As more and more of the castle was revealed, players noticed eggs containing small creatures that resembled dragons, these eggs would emit a heartbeat when looked at.

While the ice melted even more, a strange sphere appeared above Polar Peak. This sphere protected the Ice King himself while he charged up an attack, powered by a shard of... THE CUBE!

#Gettin' Chilly

The Ice King broke out of the sphere and projected a large form behind him. Using this giant form, he swirled up a huge snowstorm that enveloped the map.

After the entire map was covered in snow, ~~Cube Monsters 2.0~~ the Ice Leigon began appearing all over. These monsters are a modified version of cube monsters, this is most likely because the Ice King charged the cube with ice energy instead of the evil energy that the cube was usually full of.

#The Prisoner

As the ice melted even further, a figure emerged. This figure is none other than the fire king, encased in ice. After he finally melted the entire iceberg, he sets out on a journey to re-charge his powers.

Once his powers returned, he performed a ritual to create a volcano near Wailing Woods. Over time, Wailing Woods dried up and ashes began rising from the ground.

#Adventure Awaits

To quote Will Smith, ""thas hot, thas haaaut""

Season 8 kicks off with the volcano finally appearing! The fire king has set up his own living space there. Some of the eggs have hatched and reveals multiple instances of ""Hybrid"", a cool ninja-dragon. (Because it is a well-known law of the universe that ninja-dragons are awesome.)

The Ice King, Fire King, and a crew of Fishsticks set out on an adventure to find treasure! Yeah, I think this part was just for the trailer...

Meanwhile, the ""Master Key"" skin has one of his keys stolen by the Hybrids, this most likely has something to do with Luxe. (This is why the skin is currently so boring, there's gonna be more stuff later on)

The government from Season 4 has returned and is digging out spots on the map in search for hop rocks, but they might just uncover something else...

Also im not saying removing mats off kills is a good thing but just like before season 7 its still possible to have mats.

    Do your 90s really need floors?

    Do you need to ramp-floor-wall or will ramp-wall do?

    Do you need to waste 200+mats to kill little timmy?

    Lowground peeks can be super effective you dont need the highground to win.

     Stop overbuilding and look for opportunities to shoot rather than build and most fights will be a lot shorter.

   Do you need to be 2-3 stories higher before you even think about taking shots at the enemy?

    If the enemy builds a skyscraper above you why waste mats getting up there just chop it and he will either fall or be smart and come back down.

   Enemies tend to have mats when you kill them so if you get kills you will have mats endgame.
    
    Carry flintlocks/impulse nades to take height without mats.
   
  Obviously there will be situations where you are forced to build like when youre at low health, being pinched by multiple ppl, etc, but for a 4v4/2v2/1v1 you dont have to use 200-300+ mats every fight",FortNiteBR

I've never seen a game so poorly managed in my entire life, this game is only 2 or 3 weeks away from one of the biggest E sport events of all time, and your game runs like ass.

Their is so much bugs that make the game even worse, imagine having a player in the world cup, dying to a glitch, and losing thousands of dollars.
Also, the game has gotten quite stale, this season in my opinion is the worst, they took away the siphon and mats, their taking away streached resolution, the battle pass was pretty bad besides the banana skin.

Every update, they bring some gun that I'll never use, instead of fixing their game. Also, having an update every week is horrible, it doesn't give them enough time to test if their is bugs, or test if its balanced. Maybe every 2.5 weeks we get an update?

Now, this is kinda of a personal thing, but this game is literally pisses me off so much everytime I play it, I cannot stand playing it anymore, it ether pisses me off, or it's to boring and stale, I'm usually a very chill person and very laid back, but I swear to God, everytime I play a match, I get pissed, I've never heard myself using such vulgar language, this game used to make me happy, but now I cant stand playing it.

The poison damage trap does 80 damage total to health, and bandages only allow to 75, meaning they won‚Äôt save you from this trap either, it‚Äôs a correlation between the lower rarity health/shield item caps that both the traps surpass.

When the sweaties see this, they'll be like ""O no no I can't be seen in public wearing a bot skin or I'll lose ttv subz!"" Slowly, the soccer skin will die out until no one ever uses it.

* When you aim, you see the T.E.D.D.Y. pull out the guns on his hands
* When you eliminate someone, you hear ""YOU ARE NOT A BEAR.""

If they even take the loading screen idea, use the bottom picture.

Ballers need to go. The late game/end game in this game is fucking CANCER with 900 ballers rolling around and people getting free rotations with no consequences. Either lower the health on them or make it so people get shot through them. It's pretty ridiculous if you ask me (and I don't even play COMP!) SUGGESTION: When the game gets to a certain ""circle"" or ""late game"" or ""timer"" or whatever it may be, make the game all of a sudden despawn all vehicles and make EVERY player fight for his rotation and placement in the late game. 

I've played this game since season 1, nearly 1700 wins total, and I've seen this game at it's highs and it's lows. This is officially it's all TIME LOW. 

There are vital and essential aspects of this game need fixing BAD but you guys refuse to address them and just constantly add pointless stupid fucking bullshit to this game.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want new cosmetics, ballers, new weapons or new POI, **I want to be able to play the game.**  I don't want to have 300 ping final circle, I don't want triple my ususal ping at the best of times, I want my graphics to load when I land, I want to be able to move without lagging.  I want builds to place without an opponent being able to replace them while I hold down turbo build, I want to be able to rift without waiting a minute for my game to load, I don't want 5 fps in the middle of fights. I don't want to dread every update because something else will break and the game will become unplayable. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I understand the game cannot be fixed overnight and there will always be bugs, but do something to improve the performance rather than just build on what is already broken.  I'm getting bugs that were supposedly fixed last season.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall the game is a huge disappointment.  I've been playing every day for nearly a year, I love this game, it is my favorite but I have watched the performance gradually get worse.  Every patch is now adding new bugs into the game. In it's currant state I can't play it anymore.  Every season it has been getting worse, as sad as it is I'm tired of dying unfairly because of lag or some other performance issue.  Sorry; but if there isn't some performance update next patch I give up Fortnite this season.  I realise no-one will care, I realise it makes no difference to Epic, but if enough people do like I do, then maybe the game will get fixed, and there will certainly be less raging...

&amp;#x200B;

It's a sad day to think it has come to this, but I've waited long enough for some fixes, I'm not waiting anymore :(",FortNiteBR

Anyone can stream, no matter how good or bad you might be!","When you go on a 10 game losing streak and think to yourself ""I shouldn't be streaming. No one wants to watch this..."" You're wrong.

I will watch Tfue die 10+ times in a row quickly(just out of bad luck) and that A) doesn't stop him from streaming, and B) doesn't stop his viewers from watching.

Now obviously Tfue is an incredible player with a very large fan base, so that helps his situations... But how about this?

Some dude came to my stream and asked to follow for follow. I did(and you always should too!) and at a later time I went by his stream and checked out what he was all about.

First of all. He had over $10,000 USD worth of Bits donated to him at the top of his chat. Had a decent amount of subs over the course of the last year or so(about 100 subs in a year,) and he only had about 10ish viewers.

Are these amazing numbers unheard of numbers? No, but they're numbers, and he's doing pretty well for a guy that only gets 10 viewers at a time.

His gameplay though? He was playing Arena, around 250 points, and just camping almost every game. He would just hide until the final circles, not get any kills really, but because he placed in the final circles he was able to rack up points.

Not the best gamer in the world. Not the most active voice. Not getting many kills or wins. Still making a name for himself as a streamer!!

It just goes to show, it doesn't matter how good or bad you are at the game. All that really matters is that you offer people something they will enjoy watching!

It could be your incredibly positive attitude(or in some peoples cases their incredibly negative attitudes,) it could be the music you play, it could be any number of things... But don't hesitate to stream because you think you're not very good!

Plus, if you're streaming Fortnite, it means you're playing Fortnite, which means you're actively practicing and getting better with time!! =) So it's win win!

Just remember. It sucks sometimes not getting any viewers when you're starting out, but just stay positive and keep at it. Eventually you will make your first follower, then your second, then your 100th and so on! =) GL and HF!!",FortNiteBR

I'd take a bow over an RPG potentially because it hits hard and takes shotgun ammo. RPG's have a counter, being they are fairly slow at medium to long range. Boom bow... not so much. I'd call it the third party bow because anyone encountering a build battle is super easy to shoot and clean up from range. Even first shots on people caught off guard are at least at half health from full shield and are easy to wipe after hitting them just once. There is also no audio cue. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

However I don‚Äôt get why they reduced the amount of mats you get whilst farming... you just spend the first 10/15 minutes farming and then one big build battle and you‚Äôre back to square one?

At the moment I‚Äôm in my bathroom trying to hold back my tears. 

My family‚Äôs going through some shit right now, everything‚Äôs collapsing, it‚Äôs been collapsing for years now but I just now started noticing.

Accusations of my dad committing adultery, being a drunk, going out and not coming back, stealing money.

It‚Äôs all affecting me and it hurts.

When epic released arena I started playing it as a means to get a high rank so I could be cool at school (I know, it‚Äôs lame I‚Äôm only 16).

I got hooked, I‚Äôm almost champion right now I‚Äôm 20 points away and I finally think I found my purpose, my goal.

On Saturday I started the warmup two hours late and could only play five out of 10 games, I was so close to top 500 and earning that sweet cash but our time ran out before I could get it, I wasn‚Äôt sad though; the fact that we got so far made me so proud I haven‚Äôt been this happy in ages.

I want to do this for a living, I do. It hurts that my parents don‚Äôt support it though, my mom‚Äôs giving me shit and thinks it‚Äôs a waste of time.

I don‚Äôt know what depression is and haven‚Äôt been diagnosed at all with anything but lately I‚Äôve been in the crossfire of everything happening and I can‚Äôt help but feel sad. 
I gave up hurting myself a while ago after I found out my girlfriend did the same and the immense guilt that I felt after finding out that I put her through the same thing got to me. I can‚Äôt help but admit that it‚Äôs been harder lately, why can‚Äôt I just play and have fun like a normal teenager

Arena‚Äôs what I‚Äôm excited to go to bed and wake up the next day for and I‚Äôm so grateful to this game and it‚Äôs community for helping me through everything.

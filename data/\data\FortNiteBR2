If we need 90 Fortbytes to get the skin itself, I feel like that means we need 95 to get stage 2 and 100 to get stage 3. Multiple Fortbytes have also required battle pass items to be used... So that might mean we need to use Vendetta on one of these challenges. It also looks like we need to do a TON of weekly challenges to get every fortbyte too... If I'm right, that means that Singularity is harder to get than tier 100, maybe even the hardest skin to earn in the game. What do you think?",FortNiteBR

However syphon effected lesser skilled players aswell, because they have no reason to fight.. I am here to make a proposition about trying out these popup settings in pubs for a little bit.. 

So here they are 

Heath gained on elimination: 50 
Material gained wood: 20
Material gained brick: 10 
Material gained metal: 10

Material caps

Wood: 700
Brick: 500
Metal: 300

(I believe apart from mat syphon these are the scallywag duo cup settings)

This material count adds up to 1500 which would punish overbuilding but make it easier to achieve max materials, because the players do not need to go out of their way to farm heavy mats. 

Thanks for the read and feel free to discuss what you think especially lesser skilled players even experienced good players...",FortNiteBR

Now, the mats. Pub solo games have gotten sweaty in end games and with no increased harvest rate or mats on kills you have more deaths because of running out of materials.

(Rant),"People talking about wanting the bolt back and the suppressed vaulted has been much more common as of lately. And quite honestly, it annoys me. The only real reason people want it back is because of nostalgia as far as I‚Äôm aware. **Just because a gun has been in the game for a long time does not mean it should be in the game now. This applies to the zapotron, OG smg, and tac smg too.**

If the bolt was introduced right now with every other gun in the game still being here, and as an entirely new gun, would people want it vaulted? Think about it. This is season 9. Everyone has got much better at the game since the time that the bolt was around. The bolt was one of the best guns for *most* of its time, but it would be overshadowed by most other snipers right now, especially the heavy. That‚Äôs how it was in season 5 and above. People would not see a reason for it to be in the game when everything else does a better job. If you got hit with a bolt today, it would do everything the suppressed does excluding the silenced effect. 

To those who want the bolt back, what will bringing it back do for the game that makes it so important to you?",FortNiteBR

I understand that the six shooter was removed. But if they are willing to give Biz that, we need to see what older battle pass skins are doing. Season 7 is a perfect example of this.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Un-vault: 

1. Pump shotgun (green/blue/purple/gold): Anyone who disagrees with me can block me idc.

2. 50 health/50 shield Siphon upon elimination: So many reasons, less RNG, makes solo-squadding more feasible, rewards being good at the game. I think we can all agree that Fortnite was more fun with siphon in all modes.

3. 30% increased farm rate: No one likes dying with no mats and spending the first 5 minutes of every game farming 

4. Pop-up cup materials (500/500/500): Ensures that everyone has adequate materials, and after a kill you can easily re-max your mats, no over-building

5. Ability to carry 10 minis: We want more shield, Fortnite is less RNG and better when more shield is available in inventory space and shield spawns

6. Bolt-action sniper rifle w/ old bullet drop (blue/purple/gold): Most fun sniping experience in Fortnite in my opinion, snipers now are so toxic and everyone knows it.

7. FAMAS burst assault rifle (purple/gold): Loved how this gun rewarded good aim.

8. Suppressed SMG (grey/green/blue): Tac smg was too op, suppressed was most balanced and still very accurate and good.

9. Hunting rifle (green/blue): How could you not want the hunting rifle back?

10. Tactical Shotgun (purple): Just because the grey tac is so ass and why not if we're bringing pumps back? Season 9 has made me appreciate the tac so much more, I used to never carry it. I don't have a problem with a shotgun pool of tac, pump, combat as long as the grey tac is gone.

11: Suppressed scar (purple/gold): This was a good gun, sometimes the bloom was horrible but it had great range and damage output.

12: Dual Pistols (blue/purple): My controller out there players know why! #L2spam

13. Bouncers: For all the trickshotters/clip hunters out there

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Vault: 

1. Semi-Auto Sniper rifle (green/blue/gold): Worst gun in the game atm, I hate how I get third-party spammed by it. It actually does a lot of damage to other players' builds, which also sucks. Why Epic would vault the Hunting Rifle and un-vault the semi-auto sniper baffles me.

2. Storm-flip: No one likes the storm flip, probably a top-3 worst addition to Fortnite

3. Drum gun (green/blue): Makes bots able to kill good players, if you're getting spammed by two drum guns at once, GG. I hate the Spam-meta more than anything else in Fortnite.

4. Heavy-sniper (purple/gold): Most toxic gun; takes no skill and ruins everyone's game. Everyone just camps on mountains with heavy snipers. Also being able to one hit a full metal/brick wall is not realistic at all.

5. Burst SMG (grey/green/blue): This gun is dogshit and you and I both know it. Bring back the suppressed.

6. Tactical shotgun (grey): See #10 above.

7. Proximity grenade launcher/Regular grenade launcher: Explosives are way too overpowered in this game. I believe Fortnite should be about building, editing, and shotgun/AR accuracy, and not about spamming 16 grenade launchers just to get a kill. 

8. Reduce maximum RPG rockets to 6 rockets: Again, I believe Fortnite should be about building, editing, and shotgun/AR accuracy, not spamming explosives. Being able to carry 13 rockets is toxic. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I would also like to add that Fortnite needs to fix the game audio because it is trash, and a new map would be refreshing. That is all.

&amp;#x200B;

(Fortnite Theory),"So I was doing the week 7 challenge where you had to go to Mega mall and Snobby shores in the same match. Then I saw a weird futuristic looking sideways triangle? It had an animation so I can tell that it wasn't a bug or anything, it's almost as if it was intentional (Otherwise they would have removed it by now). This little discovery led me down a big rabbit hole of brainstorming why it's there and some little details. Let me show you all the points of the theory I made.

1st: Neon Sideway Triangle (again...)

Someone coded the animation of that triangle in Snobby and when I did research it's been there for a week or so I think so it couldn't be a mistake. It looks like it belongs in Neo Tilted or Mega Mall because of it's colour and generally how it 'behaves'. It is part of a Fortbyte but Epic Games likes to hint at stuff so maybe it means more.

https://i.redd.it/2y98w9holy531.png

2nd: Viking Village

Viking Village is just next to Snobby Shores and in the lore the Vikings attacked Snobby turning it into a Viking Shores? Anyways I was looking at this loading screen and realised that there is no snow in the background! You can even see some normal green trees! I went into playgrounds trying to see if you can see grass and trees but nope! Just snow! Suspicious...

https://i.redd.it/8n33i93chy531.jpg

3rd: The Dragon

Around week 5-7 a Dragon appeared in Polar Peaks that eventually escaped and went into the water. Now it's at Loot Lake and broke some electrical wires powering Neo tilted and possibly Mega Mall. This will become important later.

https://i.redd.it/nk3cb1s9ly531.jpg

4th: 14 Days Of Summer

There are leaked free challenges called 14 Days Of Summer and at the time i'm writing this it's summer! This means for these couple weeks (possibly longer) Fortnite will put a big emphasis on summer. Now that you got some details let me propose to you my Snobby shores/Viking Village theory!

https://i.redd.it/t8hl86azky531.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

**SNOBBY SHORES AND VIKING VILLAGE THEORY (SEASON 9)**

During the 14 days of summer the ice will melt because of the heat and the dragon will either cause a Neo Tilted/Mega Mall power surge or the dragon will straight up destroy them. Then the residents of the Fortnite island create a new Snobby shores/Viking Village city or summer resort. Summer Shores? Villa Village? I might be onto something or it could be me. /:

[Maybe something like this?](https://i.redd.it/pk3yruwwly531.jpg)

I have played videogames all my life and when I was 17 years old I was actually pretty good at competitive counter strike, but I stopped playing FPS games a while ago. This post is 50% whine and 30% thinking out loud 20% talking about an actual problem with fortnite.

Now I play on console just to relax and have fun, and I like Fortnite a lot... when the lobby is not full of players who are much more skilled than me. I'm willing to get better and I actually enjoy that as well, but I can't keep the pace of most kids who are cranking 90's, edit maps and so on in creative for a couple hours a day.

For me it's been a huge leap to start playing a FPS with controller, and the building and editing add a layer of complexity and reflex based gameplay that I just cant learn as fast as most kids nor cirmcuvent that with experience or hours of practice.

I just would like to be matched against players with similar skill level. I'm a 0.7KD player with like 800 games and just 4 wins, and Im just getting too tired of not being able to do absolutely anything against those 5-6 players on each lobby that are just too much.

So I pray that one day Epic adds a mode that lets me play against players of my skill level (which I guess are the majority of players) so I can actually win 1 in 100 matches or less. I don't want to go pro, I want to chill and play casually and improve naturally.

Id like to add that as a game designer myself, I loved the idea of syphon and I think its a great mechanic to actually balance the game and reward good players, but with a skill gap in lobbies like this, its just not viable if you want anything but pub stomping by pro players. I also liked the pump shotgun but the problem is the same. What I'm trying to say is that the biggest balancing issue with fortnite is matchmaking and they might be on a spiral of unbalancing and unpopular changes to the gameplay just because the matchmaking in public games is still not there.",FortNiteBR

Not only is Fortnite in free fall on Google Trends.  Not only is it in free fall on Twitch.  But now, Superdata is reporting that it's earning considerably less than it ever has.

https://twinfinite.net/2019/06/superdata-fortnite-slumps-in-may-but-pubg-quietly-continues-to-sell-millions/

Epic, how much more data do you need to see that your game is completely broken.  The skill gap has turned from ""Sweet!  I have high ground on this mountain and a rocket launcher, I feel strong!"" to ""Oh those soccer sweats are rushing me from across the map, I'm f***ed.""

Casual players (the majority of the player and revenue base) aren't having fun anymore.  When they leave the competitive community starts complaining because there are fewer and fewer ego stroking easy kills.

Epic will run Fortnite into the ground unless they figure out how to make the game more fun for the majority of it's player base again.  Money is flying out of the window right now.",FortNiteBR

Throw everyone into the pot and earn your Victory Royale.

Arena Mode, which is supposed to be ranked does an awful job at keeping players of similar skill levels together.

I have a .92 KD ratio and a large portion of those kills are from traps/ambushes I set up.  In Arena mode I'll regularly get stomped by players with 3.0+ KD ratios.  This is absolutely horrible design by Epic.  Us casual players need to have a place where we can work on our skills without getting lasered by no life sweats all the time.

Do you think Epic is going to fix this anytime soon?  It's rather embarrassing to put your name on such a poorly designed mode.",FortNiteBR

The name that I have come up with is below and the reasons it is called that.

The monster's name is an acronym but he might get mad if anybody tells him what his name means so don't tell him.

The name is Bill.

B - Stands for big. The reason for that is because it was big enough to destroy half of polar peak. Most likely because it was trying to get out of it.

![img](709s0uri0u531)

I - Stands for Ignorant. The reason for that is that it destroyed a home of the houses in Snobby when it was dealing with the vikings and I don't think the home owner was happy. He also destroyed a home in Pleasant and that home owner probably wasn't happy either. It also took a little nibble on a part of the Loot Lake buildings and cable and will probably result in some power issues for Tilted but that isn't a big deal.

![img](o9we2kal0u531)

![img](dzuxt1qj0u531)

L - Stands for Loch Ness. (Yes, I know it's two words but just ignore it) The reason for that is because the monster was seen in the water near Spawn Island carrying the polar peak castle on it's back.

![img](upfxb44o0u531)

L Stands for Lizard. The eyes of the polar peak monster looks like a lizards eyes, and the foot prints near Polar look like a dinosaur's foot print

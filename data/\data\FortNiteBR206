&amp;#x200B;

Aaron from Epic here to talk to you folks about controllers and our plans for enabling you to play how you want. Just on the horizon are Custom Controls landing in the v6.0 update, which will let you modify your setup as you wish!

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*Custom Control Flow\*\***

The way you‚Äôll be selecting the configuration has changed to a selector on the left side of the menu. After selecting Custom, the right side of the menu becomes buttons that are selectable. When a button is clicked, it opens a list of actions that can be assigned to that button.

&amp;#x200B;

Mode selection (Combat, Build) has changed to selectable by triggers. When you‚Äôre in a mode, the actions for that mode and actions that span between modes will show in the actions list to select from.

&amp;#x200B;

The idea here is to make a system that is easy to use and can be built upon with more functionality in later releases, if needed.

Even when the old shotgun delay was put in people still did it. With season 5 the new spam meta came in with new weapons such as the p90 and drum gun, and buff and nerf or c4 and splodes and buffs with the lmg and minigun. Builds were tampered with and the traditional ‚Äújust build‚Äù was not a deciding factor in games anymore. Towards the end of the season the drum gun was vaulted, smgs were nerfed and along cane two new weapons the grappler and barrel shotgun and an old friend the guided missile. This shifted the meta a bit towards grappling to people and shooting them with the double barrel. Items such as the port a rift and port a fortress came in meaning high ground was easily attainable or and insta-built base was there. With each new addition the game quickly changed from season 1-5. So for season 6 what will the new meta be?  Will it change or will it stay the same. Personally I think Epic will try and buff the shotguns (especially the tax) they will bring back the drum gun just with either less damage or less accuracy. Splodes will have their damage reduced based on range. And the new meta will be basically be the same as it is now but with a buff to the AR. What are your thoughts?",FortNiteBR

First of all, I think the game is amazing, I still enjoy to hop on the bus with my friends and play some games, I enjoy getting rekt, raging, BMing, killing, stupidly dying, and winning.

**BUT**

I feel like the game is going in a direction that makes it way too repetitive. Let me break down my experience from when I started the game at Week 4 of Season 3.


**Season 3**

I played a lot of PUBG with one of my friends, we enjoyed battle royale, but after a short time, he kinda got tired of the game being broken, it ran badly on his computer, and I felt the same way as well.
I really enjoyed the concept of BR and one time we were talking with my friends at the university, that they play Fortnite. I tried it before, but in comparison to PUBG, it wasn't the same thing, so I didn't really gave it enough chance back then.
But hearing that I could play BR with 3 other people made me give it an other chance, and I actually started to like the game.
When we got our first win, it felt amazing. I haven't really won in PUBG, so it counted as rarity to me. It was fun, I had fun.

So eventually after some days of playing, I bought the battle pass to spice up the experience, and my friends followed me.
It was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever felt in a long time (coming from LoL) and it made me happy.
The quests, the loot, trying every game to complete a hard sniper kill quest and so on. It was new, it was amazing.

We reached lvl 100 battle pass, and owning the John Wick skin after getting killed by him so many times was amazing.
Season 4's promo started with the meteor, it was so exiting to see it coming closer every day, finding out more and more about the whole thing. Back then everyone thought it was aliens, and we all assumed Tilted is gonna be gone, the suspense was unbearable at this point.

**Season 4**

So Season 4 came, the meteor hit Dusty, we all happy and stuff. Opening up the battle pass the first day, finding out what skins we'll get was so exciting. We did every single quest. This was my first full season, so it made it more enjoyable to be there from start to finish. We all wanted the Omega skin, it was still really enjoyable.
So jumping ahead, Season 5 promo came, the rocket ripped space and time, and we got a broken sky... Cool, what is it gonna be? Who or what's gonna come out from it. Nothing. No one. What?

**Season 5**

This was the first let down I felt in the game. Yeah, we got Paradise Palms (RIP Moisty), we got rifts, we got hooks, but it still felt so... expected? Every change welt as if I knew it was coming. It didn't surprise me. Having a whole new section on the map and many changes on it didn't surprise as much as having one insignificant part of the map dug out by a meteor. Kevin was a great addition until his second low-gravity field. At that point, we all knew it was just gonna get to Loot Lake, thanks to the game files.
There was no suspense. No excitement. We were just waiting. And then we got bouncy water. I still feel like it's cool and all, but... It's kind of anti-climactic. We patiently waited for the cube to reach LL just to make it bouncy?
I mean, I would felt much better about this outcome if I didn't know the end of Kevin's journey. The quests were literally the same as in Season 4, besides some of them (fire-rings, timed trials, etc.), but killing, searching chests, explosive damage, etc. All the same.
I've personally been doing these quests for 3 seasons now. I need something new. Something more challenging. And this is what I'm expecting from Season 6.

**Season 6 expectations**

I want more. We want more. I've seen many people complaining about quests being repetitive. Yes, the game has a certain environment and mechanics, and these are the challenges you can do with it.
But still, I feel like Epic has the capability to make something more out of the battle pass quests. High Stakes was amazing. It put a whole new twist on the game, and I hope Epic learns from this. I could imagine a heist type of challenge system, where you team up and try to do one amazing objective for the whole week.
I feel like the skins are going to be cool, but after 4 weeks of grinding that damn 7th chest in Salty or that kill in Haunted, it's going to be boring, and I won't care that much about getting that lvl 100 as I was with John Wick.

**Conclusion**

I feel like Epic knows what's up with the challenges and the grinding and the excitement about the season and I'm sure they'll do their best for Season 6 tomorrow. If not, I'll still buy the battle pass, I'll still fall to tilted to get my four shotgun kills, and I'll enjoy the game, but I'll be let down.


**Edit before edit:** I know many people will tell me, that if I don't like the game, I shouldn't play it, if I don't like the battle pass rewards or challenges, I shouldn't buy it, but these people miss my point.
I **want** to play the game. I **want** to buy the battle pass. I **want** to be excited about the game, because I really enjoyed it so far.",FortNiteBR

People, Usually adults/older teens will Q up with random players in Duos or Squads and if they get into a match with a younger kid they are immediately rude as hell to them, or tricking them so they eliminate themselves. Yeah, a lot of little kids can be loud and obnoxious BUT they are still LITTLE KIDS, they are like that if they went to an amusement park or anything else, so why do people like to make their experience playing Fortnite as awful as possible just because of their age, And they cant really use ""These kids are too young to be playing games like this"" Since Fortnite is a game that is technically rated E for everyone or PEGI 12. Why cant we just treat all players the same? Regardless of age, Older people can be just as obnoxious as little kids just not in the same way...

Sorry, Just played a squad and this group of 2 people who were AT LEAST 25 were being so horrible to this kid who was maybe 10 years old, I could tell he was almost crying, it makes me sick. Can you record these players and report them?

What needs to be added before it becomes a level playing field:

Custom mappings for macro keys need to be added. The 12 buttons on the left of my Razer mouse do nothing. I‚Äôll be playing against players who have the option to bind keys to those, so that must be added to make it fair. 

Custom DPI support needs adding too. The mouse feels so bad on console. It feels like you have very little control. 

Until those are implemented, keyboard and mouse PS4 players should either be added to their own queue (which will cause huge queue times for them) or they need to remain in the PS4 matchmaking pool. 

Of course these don‚Äôt need to be added for all mice, but popular mice need to be supported properly. ",FortNiteBR

I believe that there will be 7 new map locations in Battle Royale corresponding to the locations of the runes laid down by Kevin the Cube during Season 5.  

&amp;#x200B;

**1) The Wild West**

We have received a number of clues pointing towards a new ""Wild West"" section of the map. 

This has already been rendered in the Desert biome of Save the World mode and datamined leaks have alledgely found a number of ""Wild West"" assets in the Battle Royale game files as of June 2018. 

[Desert zone in Save the World](https://i.redd.it/jzsnh5nkilo11.jpg)

In July 2018, a Wild West -themed stagecoach spawned near Moisty Mire, which is currently located outside of Paradise Palms. Yesterday we also received a teaser for Season 6 of a cow girl captioned ""Saddle up!"", which could give credence to this theory that we will have a Wild West-themed town in the south-east of the map!

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Uncle Pete's Pizza**

With the release of the Nite Nite and Peekaboo skin's, we may see ""Uncle Pete's Pizza"" come to Battle Royale as a new location near Lazy Links. This location has already been rendered in Save the World mode: 

https://i.redd.it/d5ouzg8vllo11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

The Nite Nite skin appears to share the same mask to Uncle Pete, and this location was teased at the beginning of Season 5 with a sign to the east of Lazy Links identified by [u/BlackRabbit-78-](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlackRabbit-78-) below: 

https://i.redd.it/a3ly3z9xmlo11.jpg

This location could spawn at the rune to the south of Lazy Links.

&amp;#x200B;

**3) The Volcano** 

Leakers have identified lava/volcano assets in the game files of Battle Royale since patch 5.40. 

Here are some weblinks to these leaks:

* [https://fortniteintel.com/2018/09/12/fortnite-season-6-cube-volcanic-pit-meshes-leaked/](https://fortniteintel.com/2018/09/12/fortnite-season-6-cube-volcanic-pit-meshes-leaked/) 
* r/https://twitter.com/FNBRLeaks/status/1037647813977538560 

**4) Speculation:** 

We have received teasers of a DJ llama skin and a ninja werewolf skin for Season 6, so perhaps we might see a disco location and  some sort of werewolf-themed location tomorrow? 

Based on weekly loading screens from Season 5, I believe we may see Brite Bomber and Rex themed locations to the south of the map - as these two characters interact with Kevin the Cube in the loading screens. 

&amp;#x200B;

**SKINS**:

**1) DJ llama / Cow Girl / Ninja Werewolf**

These three skins have already been teased by Epic Games in the countdown to Season 6, images below:

[Above: From fortniteinsider.com](https://i.redd.it/619vqsrfrlo11.png)

https://i.redd.it/9315kfojrlo11.jpg

&amp;#x200B;

Most of these skins, particularly the Cow Girl, are likely to have opposite-gender versions appear in the item shop during Season 6. 

&amp;#x200B;

**2)** **Birthday Ramirez skin/Birthday Brigade set**

https://i.redd.it/6qg81dsrplo11.jpg

This skin was introduced to Save the World during the first anniversary of Fortnite's release, and the Birthday Cake back bling was released in Battle Royale too as part of the ""Birthday Brigade"" set.

It is highly likely that the Birthday Ramirez skin will feature in the Season 6 Battle Pass or the item shop for a limited period of time based on the popularity of the Brite Bomber skin to celebrate the first anniversary of Battle Royale. 

The caption of the DJ llama skin for Season 6 says ""All great parties need a DJ."" This skin would fit into the party-theme of the DJ llama skin. 

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Dark Bomber/Nite Bomber**

The week 10 loading screen of Season 5 features an image of a dark version of the Brite Bomber skin:

https://i.redd.it/wozhmcftrlo11.jpg

This skin has already been datamined by leakers as being in the game files. 

* See: [https://fortniteinsider.com/dark-bomber-skin-texture-found-in-v5-41-files/](https://fortniteinsider.com/dark-bomber-skin-texture-found-in-v5-41-files/)

&amp;#x200B;

**4) Speculation**

Based on the map changes, I believe that we may get a fire-themed skin to match the new volcano area and possibly some kind of purple cube skin. We may also get some sort of Halloween-themed battle pass skin to go with Uncle Pete's Pizza and an ""evil"" variant of the Season 5 Drift skin to match the Nite Bomber skin.

I also love [u/bjarkizh](https://www.reddit.com/user/bjarkizh) 's umbrella idea, which would fit the miscellaneous ""theme"" of Season 6: 

https://i.redd.it/8p9h7i5sslo11.png

&amp;#x200B;

**NEW FEATURES:**

**1) Pets**

Pets were datamined in the last patch by leakers, and leaked promotional art appearing briefly on the Playstation store appears to confirm this: 

https://i.redd.it/b7b6uue8tlo11.png

Note the dog in the background! 

Source of image: [https://fortniteinsider.com/new-fortnite-leaks-show-pets/](https://fortniteinsider.com/new-fortnite-leaks-show-pets/) 

&amp;#x200B;

**2) Weapon skins**

In the same datamined leak, weapon customization options were identified by leakers. So yes, pets and weapon skins are coming to Fortnite. 

Here is an alledged image of weapon customization options from Fortnite Insider: 

https://i.redd.it/z11q6jlktlo11.png

Source: [https://fortniteinsider.com/weapon-customization-for-fortnite-battle-royale/](https://fortniteinsider.com/weapon-customization-for-fortnite-battle-royale/)

&amp;#x200B;

**3) Music Packs, Battle Bus Customization, Consumable Emotes, ATK Decorations and Victory Poses**

These were also uncovered as part of said datamined leak, and appear likely based on the promotional art showing that pets will appear in Fortnite. 

Here are leaked comestic files uncovered by @FNBRLeaks on Twitter:

https://i.redd.it/lt4mp7n7ulo11.jpg

It appears that we will have an option to change the loading screen/lobby music; customize the appearance of the battle bus and battle bus music; customize ATKs in the game; and use unique animations (""consumable emotes"") when consuming things like potions and health packs.

* Link to tweet: r/https://twitter.com/FNBRLeaks/status/1037623067881693184  

&amp;#x200B;

That's all folks! 

Feel free to spread this on to other platforms, just make sure you attribute the original leakers and other reddit users. 

Enjoy Season 6 everyone!",FortNiteBR

79 dailies (2 from stacking before the                                       season and the rest from the season) = 395 stars

Free challenges (Worth 20 stars each week) = 200 stars

Levels = 308 stars 

Buying the previous battle pass = 50 stars

50+308+200+395 = 953 stars

So, since you get tier 1 for free, the highest tier someone an get on the free pass is tier 96.

Except for the double barrel which dominates. And I feel like a double barrel shouldn't be a must have. Double barrel wins almost in every duel you have. So my idea is to make all shotguns fair and square in CLOSE range battles. Because that is what shotguns are used for. 

Double Barrel: It's a high risk high reward item. Bad at longer ranges and best at super close. But all shotguns are used for close range. And this shouldn't be a dominating weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

Pump shotgun: Buff the base damage to 80 to 90 and 85 to 95. Because right now the damage isn't very sufficient. And it isn't too op. Because it has a 2x HS multiplier. Which take the blue rarity to a max of 190 damage. And the green to 180. So you won't get double pumped.

&amp;#x200B;

Heavy shotgun: Buff the damage from 74 to 80 and 77 to 85. I feel like the damage is a bit too low for a Legendary type weapon. But it shouldn't have as much damage as a pump. Because this weapon is a bit better for long ranges and has a better fire rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tactical shotgun: The damage should stay the same. Because it has a great fire rate. But I think they should reduce the spread of the three weapon types by a minor. Because the weapon is rather good. It is no match for the other shotguns. Because the large spread needs you to be super close. But that is where the Double barrel comes in and does the job. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let‚Äôs have a great and balanced variety for next season","The smg meta is fun and all but now that we understand the difference between a double pump meta and a pump smg meta, why don‚Äôt we just go ahead and combine the 2? Pump shotguns are good for lining up close range well aimed shots for high burst damage, and smg‚Äôs are good for destroying cover, high dps, high rate of fire, tracking damage, and snipers and explosives are in their own genres. Aside from BUILDING, the core element and KEY mechanic that makes fortnite, fortnite. What grabbed players‚Äô attention from the beginning was building and the satisfying pump shotgun 256 damage headshot eliminations. In the current state of pump shotguns (consistent 80 damage headshots and 75 damage body shots) it not only makes sense within the Meta to bring back double pump. But It will also bring back a huge player base and variety of which you used to be able to play the game. Back at the end of season 4 when you could double pump, pump tac, or pump tac smg, was one of the most balanced and entertaining metas epic offered across the board. You could double pump or pump smg and building HP was high enough to have a safe build battle. What epic is doing to bring in new players in and add variety to the game is an interesting direction focusing towards a pretty low skill ceiling with the new gadgets (grapplers, cannon ball bombs, fortress) and the nerfs to building, building up, and farming. As an experienced player, all you want to learn how to do is build more and find more ways to pull off cool and fun eliminations. With other competitive BR games coming out into the market I feel like it is time to bring all the fun of fortnite together for season 6 and have a really well rounded game. Keep adding Crazy shenanigans and gadgets as long as it‚Äôs balanced (honestly we might need to re-evaluate the grapplers again) but bring back double pump and keep the shotguns at their current damage per pellets rating system. Increase the materials you get when you farms and increase material hp! Smg‚Äôs will always be able to spray down walls and shotguns will always be high burst damage granted you hit your shots kids! But lastly for building. If we must keep material hp low, then let us increase the rate of farming! I want to play the game! Not farm materials that I know will be destroyed!

Pumps
Shouldn‚Äôt
Be
Added.
Epic removed double pumps because it was never supposed to be a thing, it was an exploit. They added Double barrel, which in basically every way is better (only takes up one inventory slot and does more damage, with the setback of reloading every time) but people still arnt satisfied. We arnt going to get original fortnite back because it‚Äôs evolving, a game shouldn‚Äôt stay the same forever and Epic is changing it for a reason. 
Now that I‚Äôm done with that, the Spray meta. Is stupid. Removing double pumps was good, but Spray is just a noob thing. And epic realized that. Epic can‚Äôt change metas, the community does. We can‚Äôt blame epic for changing the meta, when we are the people going along with it. You can easily kill people with a shotgun, or AR, or whatever you have Even if they have a P90 or another Spray and Pray, it‚Äôs just skill. They are making it more twords what we want but slowly. Give it time, they‚Äôre nerfing SMGs and buffing buildings, but they don‚Äôt want it to go back to what it was.
Let Epic change and stop making them feel guilty for trying something new, maybe we should try it too instead of focusing on the past.

-Increase material gain from farming
-reduce damage to structures across the board
-increase material cap, or make 3000 total instead of 1000 each
-Nerf the minigun, please
-buff shotgun damage across the board 
-add double shotgun
-remove swap delay from all weapons
-nerf/remove smgs. We don‚Äôt need 3 types of smg, the lmg, and minigun

It‚Äôs not like I want these items vaulted, but maybe just adjusted. Fortnite used to be very much about strategy and not skill. Back in seasons 1 and 2 when the ARs were literal laser guns and a shotgun could do damage over 9000, the guy who took the high ground, got towards the middle of the zone and built a badass fort could win a lot of games.

If you try the season one strategy of building up early now, you can guarantee 15 bros with double barrels will be falling in on you and you better be ready to do some crazy build fights if you want to live.

I've put some hours into the game and gotten the hang of how things are supposed to work more or less. Problem is, they don't work in practice for me. 

If I get into a fight I just die(unless there is someone even worse that runs away or panics any other way).

**The problem I am having specifically is that I learn from every death, but every death takes time and loading screens** Even if I go for Tilted Towers and die in the first minute it's still *queue up - get into match - land - get resources - fight it out - back to the loading screen - repeat* If I land elsewhere it takes even longer obviously.

Other games don't have this problem since you respawn until the match itself is over.

Long story short: **what is the best way to get better quickly in terms of building and aiming (my aiming is hot garbage) under stress?**

&amp;#x200B;

My flatmates and I have noticed a couple of things with regards to the weapon spawning, and I thought I'd write about them to see if anyone else has noticed these things too (or if epic could chip in, that would be amazing). Between my 5 flatmates and I, we have played around 3000-4000 games, so we have a large sample size.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly: POI weapon distribution.

We're convinced that the weapon spawning mechanics are not purely random. Almost every time we pick up a ""significant"" weapon (such as a scar, grenade launcher, bolt action sniper, etc) in the first POI we land in, we will kill someone in the area that also has that weapon. Say I land at Lucky Landing and pick up a purple scar. It's incredibly likely that I will kill someone in Lucky Landing with a purple scar of their own. (or they will kill me lol).

From a competitive standpoint, this levels the playing field considerably. We've been noticing this since we started playing in season 2. Every time it happen we pick up a purple scar in the starting POI, we're always on the hunt for the other person. And almost every time, we will kill someone with a purple scar of their own which they found in the same POI.

It becomes really obvious when you find something like a purple minigun. They're so big on the floor, it's obvious when someone drops one.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly: Area based weapons.

So this one is really interesting, but has much less supporting evidence. My flatmate Ben wanted to practice sniping, so he had the idea of landing on the really tall but thin mountain in the middle of the map repeatedly. (I hope you can work out what I mean lol). Almost every time he landed there, he got a sniper of some sort. Either a bolt action, a semi-auto or a hunting rifle. And this was like 18 times out of 20 drops from the chest. Now this definitely could have been entirely luck, but it's also possible that Epic chooses to spawn snipers at a higher rate on high ground.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else noticed this? I really don't think this is confirmation bias purely because of how often this happens. Let me know what you guys think!",FortNiteBR

I had to explain to someone I was playing with today what bloom is and he couldn't believe it when I said all those shots you're missing, it's most likely always bloom. He asked what it was and I had to explain that within the small circle of aim you are basically rolling a dice and it's random where in that circle the bullet hits. Unless of course you wait for first shot accuracy and while you wait you find the guy shooting you benefits from lucky bloom and his AR spray mostly all hit and kill you.

I turned the game off just now after landing a gold scar. In a mid range gun fight with someone who had a normal AR and my first bullet hit him in the head, then the rest of the clip I fired literally all flew past him while all his shits landed on me and killed me. As I'm firing I'm thinking I should stop shooting and throw up a wall as my bullets aren't hitting him, reset, go again but then I'm thinking no, I have full 200 health and my accuracy is really good, they will hit and I'll win that gun fight. I didn't.. and that's fine, it's only a game I guess

However, I feel now I'm really starting to consider is this game right for me, in its current state where you are literally rolling a dice on your bullets and people aiming centre mass have an advantage with bloom over me aiming for the head (there's less to miss centre mass than aiming for the head when 60 or 70% of your bullets could randomly miss) it may not be for me

Please Epic for the love of God, if you aren't going to look at alternatives to bloom then at least dial it right down on blue/purple/gold AR's! If I pick up a gold scar I should at the very least find bloom is a damned sight less than a common AR!

TL;DR: A common AR should have more bloom than a Gold SCAR so if we must have this filthy bloom in our game then please just dial it right down on the rarest versions of AR's!",FortNiteBR

Well for some reason, after accepting and backing out, mine defaults to the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of each respective value.

Using the example above, say I like my X sens on .43 ( .4 and then press right 3 more times). Well when I do this, accept, and back out, then come back, my sens is now slid more right and it‚Äôs halfway between .3 and .5. Now for trial purposes, I went and set it at the first .5 value, accept, backed out, came back, and now it‚Äôs in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of the .5 spectrum. 


TL:DR: My game will save adjustments made on the tenth scale, but it won‚Äôt let me save it on the hundredths. (If I try to set mine closer to .4 than .5 [say .42], it‚Äôll revert to .45.)",FortNiteBR

Ninja his reaction was just oh okay thanks man cool which is fucking stupid, I worked for the first month of my life this year and made 267,80$ which was shocking, because I didnt expect it to be so hard to earn a lot of money, and then ninja gets thousands of dollars at once and he acted like he couldnt care less, like he was forced to say thank you and he just kept on playing like nothing happened.

Its weird how this world works, I can only dream about getting that much money donated to me, it would help my family out so much atm...

But I do know that I play between 10 to 15 hours of Fortnite a week and I've never gotten hit by the thing.  Not one time.  Like...not once.  To be honest, I don't think I've ever gotten into a close call with one.  Not only that but no one in my squad even picks one up when one's available.  It's about as appealing as the bush to (not most) but all of my friends.

When Epic announced they were bringing it back they said they wanted it to be more of a scouting tool, rather than a weapon.  I actually like that idea.  The problem is, the thing doesn't last very long in the air and it's about as nimble as the Goodyear Blimp.  It just doesn't cover enough ground to do it's job effectively, which is to scout.

Does anyone else hope they keep the speed, damage, and turning radius the same, but bump flight duration from 15 seconds to something drastic like 25 seconds?  That way, the thing still sucks as a weapon, but can actually be used a bit to look for other players?

Plus, it's fun sneaking up on a player who's using one and waiting for them to come back to their player character so you can embarrass them.

Opinions?",FortNiteBR

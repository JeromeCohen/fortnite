Last time in shop Oct 18th. There's been skins like sanctum and now Spider Knight/Arachne, which were in the shop even more recently thank maverick.

&amp;#x200B;

Is Epic holding back on putting Maverick back in the store? Is he becoming a rare skin? It's the only skin I want, just for the backbling, but I've been waiting well over a month saving my v-bucks and now I don't even know if it's worth saving at this point.

Earlier today I got to tier 100 in the battlepass (yay me) I showed it to my little brother and he went crazy wanting to play a match with my newly achieved Dire. (Like most little siblings) Like a good big brother I let him play. While he was waiting he wanted to check the store. (Keep in mind I only had 950 V-bucks.) I allowed and said specifically, ""Don't buy anything."" He said, ""OK."" After this he went to the ""Squat Kick"" emote, tried to copy it for a little bit, then went back to the controller and instead of exiting the shop he bought the emote. (I also have no refunds, and no personal money to spend on the game.) After a lot of yelling I decided that this post needed to be made.

I hated it, always have always will. However, double pump I LOVED! When pumps did around 160 damage, and u could double pump, I thought they were balanced. When they removed double pump and they only did around 160 damage, they were definitely underpowered. This new damage buff feels pretty balanced, and I have no problem with it balance wise, but I’d rather get double pumped than one pumped. 
Here’s why:

There’s a clear difference between satisfying death and non satisfying deaths. U can feel it when u die. 
 Losing a sniper dual=semi satisfying, ur not happy u lost, but u can respect the other persons skill, you felt like you had a change.
 Dying to someone spamming your builds and killing you in the process, arguably the least satisfying and most aggravating way to die in the game.
You can feel the difference between both deaths. That’s true in every game. Some examples are Overwatch, rainbow, getting punched by doomfist isn’t as satisfying as getting sniped by widow, and getting shot in the foot isn’t as satisfying as getting wall banged. 
 
I have no problem with the state of pump shotguns now. I think they do a balanced amount of damage. However, it’s very annoying to see your health go from 200 to 0, from a gun that doesn’t require much skill (unlike snipers, which do require skill). I also prefer getting kills with double pump than with one pump, I like the switching, but that’s just personal preference (granted, this whole post is personal preference, that’s why it’s a discussion).
 
I love that Epic is buffing shotguns, they need it, but personally, this isn’t the way to go. Is it time to bring back double pump? I say yes, but hey, people say that every update.",FortNiteBR
57,SlyDemise,1543443323,a1b0gd,26,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a1b0gd/when_buffing_goes_too_far/,1,When buffing goes too far....,"Yet again, an unneeded patch.

Shotguns have dealt way too much damage since the release of the game. No shotgun should have the ability to one shot for 150+ damage. Shouldn't happen. It's not just a personal opinion it's logical thinking for the type of game that Fortnite is.

While sometimes it does feel satisfying to get a nice hit off onto someone for a large amount of hit points, it becomes a problem when you start very consistently doing 180 damage to someone every hit.

&amp;#x200B;

I've played close to forty games this patch and it's ridiculous, honestly, it's full off being 1 shotted.

1) \*you land, grab a gun, turn hit your opponent x5 with a pistol and get 1 shotted by a pump or a tac.

2) \*you severely outplay your opponent get large chunks of damage onto them and then your 173 hit points are immediately deleted because Epic Games thought it would be a great idea to rebuff a shotgun.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to sit here and complain about ""Oh, shotguns should do 50 damage only!""

That would be stupid but what is even more ignorant than someone saying that is the current state of the shotguns.

Not just the pump, but all of them.

&amp;#x200B;

\- You shouldn't do 28 damage with a double barrel within the same 1x1 as someone

\- You shouldn't 7 damage with any shotgun within 5-6 blocks

\- You shouldn't do anymore than 130ish damage to the head (including multipliers)

&amp;#x200B;

Quite a bit of us like Hardcore game modes, but guess what this is Fortnite Dynamite does 70 damage, so a shotgun shouldn't do 200.

&amp;#x200B;

I've played about 40 this patch and most of it consisted of 1 pumping someone, or being 1 pumped.

I've always preferred shotgun/smg long before double pump was removed and I think it is than any dual shotgun load out.

Just another point, but it is making it way too hard to get 15-20 kill games because before the first circle closes everyone has died to shotgun.

Look at the kill feed your next game and just watch how much damage you do to someone or gets done to you.

You see, fortnite has been turned into a very competitive game, build battles are a thing you must learn to be able to beat alot of the players and most new players would be intimidated by a guy double triple backflip turbo super building onto them. Really nothing can be done about that.


Alot of people would get angry if changes were made to building, i.e. more like stws building in the sense of more building health in exchange for turbo building, this would be a big change for the game forcing people to change their playstyle, but if more head on head combat ideas and utilitys were added (like double pump and weapon combos) people would have a competitive skill set in weapons and not using their matriels to build untill they are untouchable.


I know I seem like I'm one of those *the og times were better* guys but honestly I'd love to see a big change like this, even if it's like this for a week to get community feedback on it.

I wasted 1200 vbucks on a skin I didn’t want, I don’t get spare money so next season is no longer available. It annoys me because if they had a confirmation button many problems could be avoided, i searched online and a single thread had hundreds and hundreds of replies of people who accidentally bought something when saving for battlepass. Either refresh refunds every season or add a much needed confirmation button when purchasing. I was planning on buying an 800 vbucks skin/emote with my left over reward once I get max battlepass next season, now I will only have spare 600 vbucks due to this simple mistake.

This only happens if you go into build mode before pulling out your pickaxe.

This could be useful if you're running shotguns in slot 1 during a build battle and want to have an easy way to reset back to your slot 1 weapon.

Other than that, it's confusing going into build mode with a shotty, and exiting with your AR out.

In the sense of, if you got knocked, and died, that was it. There was no redemption. There was no all-game vendettas against someone. There was no second chance of possible success and/or failure against someone who has killed you. It was cut and dry, you're dead, &amp; onto the next game. I understand the versatility of respawns, and how it can prolong a game. However, I feel like it's just a bit too ridiculous most of the time, seeing as how there's almost zero repercussions to dying, other than maybe wasting your shields. When those are gone, it's basically kamikaze at that point, every drop. I sometimes can farm a single person, or multiple people, quite literally for the whole game, and vice versa, because there's just nothing that you can do about it. Seeing as how gliding is significantly slower after the initial drop glide too, you're the easiest target to shoot. 3/5 times I can drop anybody who's gliding almost anywhere in this game mode, ESPECIALLY if I'm just sitting right below the respawn spot that everybody shares. 

I think I speak for a lot of people when I say, we want 50v50 back. I love the TDM idea, but, bring back 50v50. Please. ",FortNiteBR

First of all, there are 25 players left before 1st zone even closes...if youre lucky enough to kill 7-8 players at Tilted you almost always at least in my case, always end up with less health then when I started the game...As I’m writing this, I land Retail...get 4 kills within 45 seconds of landing, I have 55 HP and none of the opponents I killed had healing. Im now punished and killed by a 100-100 player who looted 1 house and got minis and a slurp juice...must be nice. 

Second of all, Shotgun Buff. I love it. But its just reality, you get hit harder now. Bots even hit you for 75-100 damage if you give them the chance to hit you. This by default means you need to heal in greater amounts after fights...the 50 HP/Shield allows you to play fast and aggressively knowing that if you do succeed and wipe your landing spot you will almost always be rewarded with 100-100 instead of leaving with 72 Hp and 1 bandage for the road. 

Lastly, this isnt a complaint...if this never gets added, it is what it is. However, after playing in the winter royale, the event before that, and even the duos alchemist cup tonight...it just seems so logical to reward players for actually doing something other than just looting the entire game. With that being said, there is nothing wrong with looting for a while and getting what you need, but that shouldnt hinder a good players ability to be aggressive. Ive played a total of 11 solo matches today...in 7/11 games I didnt get shield in my landing spot, with that being said...I got a couple kills, 2-4 and then die due to low HP...a Grey Tac hits for 75 now for christ sake...screw bandages, make Minis a grey item and boost the drop rates...aswell as giving health or shield for kills. Not saying i wouldve won all my fights but the likely hood of me surving with 150 HP as opposed to 55 is night and day. ",FortNiteBR

This is by no means an angry lost, just expressing my opinion.

Playing on keyboard and mouse on ps4 is totally different to playing KB+M on PC. If you have ever played on PS4 and PC there is a big different as I have played on both. PS4 is extremely laggy with the input, but it’s still possible to play with PC players but makes it very challenging even when editing is layer, movement is delayed etc. The whole mechanics on KB+M on PS4 is so much slower than PC. Playing on PS4 is almost like having a $300 PC. PS4 is just so much slower than PC and is just frustrating being destroyed by PC players like this - this has made the game so much more boring for me too. 

Also, KB+M players who are up against controller plays have NO advantage what so ever. It is just as easy to be good on controller then it is on KB+M - hence why in the competitive they clearly stated that they have come to realisation that controller players are good enough for PC players. As I have played on both controller and PC, I know that it’s very possible. 

My friends who play on PS4, who have a controller, can beat me easily while I’m on KB+M. 
Playing controller on PS4 is just as good as playing KB+M on PS4 - there are NO differences. Especially when now days in Fortnite, controller plays can do so much more with custom binds. Ghost Aydan and Nickmercs both very good players. These 2 both play controller on PC lobbies which says a lot about controller.

Now the short term solution would be to play on controller again. Well, now that I have been playing KB+M all my life now, I wouldn’t be able to switch over to controller that easily. I recently had a cheaper PC but it has broken, and I cannot afford a new one and I have been playing KB+M on PS4 since season 3. 

If I was completely honest (my opinion) when KB+M players on PS4 matched up with just PS4 players it was just fine - and not just because I was on KB+M. But I still got destroyed by other players, and now if it went back to the usual controller plays would still dominate us KB+M on PS4. 

Making KB+M players on PS4 match up with controller players on PS4 would be so beneficial, not just to me but I’m sure others. 

P.S - by no means is this a rage post, this is just me expressing how I feel about the situation. 

Please feel free to comment, would
love to hear other people’s thoughts on this.

TL;DR
Pc KB+M players have a much smoother gameplay compared to PS4 players on KB+M as PS4 has only max 60Hz. Controller on PS4 against KB+M on PS4 are without a doubt the same skill level, eclectically now with majority of players being extremely good. May I also add they there is aim assist on controller which inevitably helps. (My opinion)

Feel free to comment.

Here is some things I would personally like added to the game to make it more enjoyable first person LTM,no building LTM and a boosted loot LTM just to make the game a little different from time to time and maybe add a way to keep LTM because not everyone likes the current LTMS and I think instead of just replacing them they should make a new menu system that shows all the LTMS (kinda like a cs:go sever list) to be added to make the game more customisable for the players.",FortNiteBR

PUBG took legal actions on Epic Games resulting in a disclosed lawsuit which has now been released as a total of 200 million dollars and a small portion of future profits.

Blue hole stated in a public announcement that they didn’t want to have to take action on Epic Games but because they only credited them as an inspiration with no payment at all toward their company they felt they were unfairly being used by another company as PUBG lost a very large amount of players because of Fortnite and it’s massive growth. Epic may make a comeback if their sales increase but due to the games steady decrease in players, they will most likely shut down.

On the other hand, Epic will likely be bought by a larger company because of the amount of potential the game has for other company’s.

Currently we only have the option to turn off Aim assist all together and thats not an option. Console players receive a lot of hate about this mechanism and i for one dont understand why its even in the game.  
I understand you want to make the game somewhat easy to play for new players but please, atleast give us the option to turn off this feature!

Thank you in advance!

PS: New beginners dont even know about this feature, i showed my GF the other day how to abuse aim assist in one of her first games and she honestly said and i quote ""But thats not fair?""",FortNiteBR

Then things kind of calmed down.  Games came and went. There was a stagnant period during the PS3 days with PC gaming.  And while esports and competitive PC gaming was still around, no particular game had REALLY gotten to the level of CS (well no shooter game).  

&amp;#x200B;

Enter Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortnite is the ""CS 1.6"" of this generation.  But now you have all of this new technology.  Our phones can play this game, we have cross-platform play.  There is so much content and the developers are well equiped to embrace and provide an awesome and exciting ecosystem for all of us... Old and new. to participate.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm older now.  I have a career, I have a fiancee, mortgage payment, car payment, ""grown up resposibilities"".  But I still play.  I still can hold my own, I can still win solo but I am not on the level as some of you younger folk.  My message to you, if you are that high  schooler / early college student playing this game:  ENJOY IT!  It is not often a game like this comes around and engulfs a community.  


There won't be a game that kills fortnite.  Fortnite isn't currently my favorite game.. but Fortnite is fun.  And Fortnite is the Gorilla in the room.  Nothing is going to dethrone it anytime soon.  And the gaming enviornment this game brings is really amazing.  ",FortNiteBR

Just to be clear, this island would only be in playground mode. While your at it, why not add that Museum for vaulted items everyone was talking about that one time. This picture is not that good because 1. I am not good at these things 2. I don't have photoshop, feel free to take this picture a make it better.

* Too many weapons. Look at all the ARs, shotguns and explosives in the game and all the other neat stuff they've added. Together, it's too much and a fair amount of this stuff should be in the LTMs only. Fortnite was better when it was a bit more simple.

* Updates have gotten boring. The start of S6 was a very lack luster update. The cube event dragged on for way too long and the end result of loot lake having some islands is super lame. The game desperately needs a second map or some substantial changes at this point. If you still love the map, fantastic, but I personally am not enthusiastic about it anymore. Been there, done that.

* The skin game is terrible these days. Sure, there have been some nice skins, but most are trash in my honest opinion. There are a lot of really nice ideas they could be pumping out. Halloween had some good stuff but all the repeat skins really pushed me away from giving a shit about the shop. Since then most skins have been boring. Also, encrypting some of the leaks takes from the hype that used to come on patch day. ",FortNiteBR

IMO, shotguns are not supposed to be consistent, its a BUCKSHOT weapon meaning if not all pellets hit you don't do the full damage. Even close range with both parties moving, jumping and all that you're not going to consistently hit with every pellet.

Now because people are complaining, specially the top streamers who already body people on a regular basis EPIC is changing it, even going so far as to say if you only hit with one pellet or two you will now always be credited with 3 hits. So now their crediting hits that are even actually happening.

Before people chime in, I personally, never used or asked for double pump back, but also never complained about it, it took up a slot to use and still required skill so I didn't mind it.

Waiting for people to use the excuse if you actually got shot at close range with a shotgun you'd die, well same with a pistol or any other weapon including a real pickaxe. ",FortNiteBR

Pretty much all of the matches I played end through countdown with neither team reaching 100 elims.  I believe a match is about 25 minutes, which is just too long.  Both teams start in the high teens or at a full 20 squad only to have single digits as the match progresses, more members drop out from the losing team.  I think an offset needs to happen, either increase the number of players per team or lower the required kill count from 100 to 50 or 75.  Also, a smaller storm circle would help.  A player can hang out on the edge of the circle and not be killed once in a match.",FortNiteBR

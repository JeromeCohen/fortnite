No, Fortnite won't die because of this. No, you will not leave the game and if so, there are millions of other players still enjoying it.

2. Just accept that they didn't want ultra high burst weapon swaps in the game and that this change was healthy for the versatility of playstyles.

3. They didn't revert the double pump fix when people cried, the didn't remove the guided missile when people cried, they will not remove the weapon swap delay when people cry.

4. Get over it already and adapt to the new gameplay. It literally disqualifies you as a good player, when you have been doing good before the update and struggle just because a delay of .25 seconds. 0.25 SECONDS, NOT EVEN HALF A SECOND


No, I am not a bad player, I'm just not a crybaby and not dependent of .25 seconds to be good at the game.",FortNiteBR

However it is also true that many other games give you some compensation (black desert online gives us xp scrolls). I dont think its realistic to ask for v bucks or cosmetics.

However, the season ending is soon approaching and I like many others have been grinding my ass of for those 2 stars every level, currently need 15k for 2 stars, TWO! My biggest pain with the down time is that its has cut Into the xp I need to continue to grind towards my reaper skin.

So I ask, please can we get some extra dailies? Like 3 or 4 total? Give us 2 tiers please. I know that they have the 10 tiers for sale right now, but people who were gonna buy those are gonna buy them anyway. For those of us who were going to grind could certainly use those extra stars.

By adding items such as the port a fort they are ruining the game for people who want to go for the wins and are slowly removing the skill element. An example of this is the guided missile, it requires very little skill to use and it's rng if you find one. The port a fort has completely screwed the skill in the building area of the game, you no longer need to rely on your own skill.
Another example of them removing the skill element is the delay between switching weapons. Adding the delay slows down the pace of the game when the pace of the game is what brought many players. It also stops player switching weapons to maximise their damage output which gives more time to compose yourself in fights. This will also increase the length of fights.
The new items: Fortnite have no public testing on items  before implementing them, this results in items being unbalanced for the couple of weeks epic takes to fix them and release the patch. Many games have tts (technical test servers) to trial new patches before they're released and I see no reason why epic couldn't do this too. It would make items much more balanced upon release saving them time.

I am a noob. I got a K/D of about 0.3 - .0.4 with just 2 wins on my belt mainly from being carried. I play maybe an hour a day max and I really enjoy this game even though most of the time I get demolished. The new update has affected me and has made the game feel so slow and just weird. I enjoyed striving to play better like the pro's and I seriously think you need to go back and take a look at the weapon change delay. It needs to be reworked because it doesn't appeal for most people, noob or pro. The fun imo was learning how to do things pro's did.

Epic's doing a great job and they want the game to work just as much as all of you if not more. It's okay to report and be frustrated with bugs and issues but let's lay off personal attacks on the dev team.","**Don't ask ""Why don't they just?""** In my experience gamer communities are really quick to default to ""Why don't they just?"" arguments that oversimplify problems, especially younger gamers who have never worked in the tech industry. It's why we keep seeing people complaining about skins, features, and content instead of bug fixes because as armchair developers they think if you handed them the reins they could fix it themselves in a week. Anyone with experience in dev or QA for anything other than small personal project knows how many man-hours get spent just **meeting** about problems like these. It is far from trivial to fix. You can't ""just"" add AWS and have everything magically work.

**Fortnite is a great game and Epic has been standing out compared to their competitors in their community interaction. We're driving them away.** Fortnite is an incredibly polished experience compared to its competition and Epic is handling a game that is shockingly and suddenly popular in a surprisingly open way. The fact that they're posting about outages on this subreddit within minutes of them starting and personally updating us constantly is almost unheard of in this industry. Lots of other devs with games this huge go practically dark and they can take forever to respond to their communities as they try to perfectly wordsmith every player communication. You can almost see this happening in slow motion with Epic as we drive them away with constant front-page posts complaining about their decisions.

**New content isn't a bad thing. This is the right time in the game's lifecycle to experiment with new things. Battle Royale isn't an eSport, don't treat it like one.** Beyond that, there's a strange sense of dissonance in the community where we love to upvote people's ideas for new content in the game, but then lose our minds whenever Epic actually adds anything new. Let's not mince words -- Battle Royale is incredibly fun and challenging and it appeals to a wide range of players with different skill levels, but it is not an eSport. Some of you might play it like one, but this is fundamentally the right sort of genre to try out these sort of fun ideas. This isn't CSGO where you're making changes in the middle of a competitive season and ruining tournaments. We're still in the early stages of this game and this is absolutely the right time for the team to add new content and try out new ideas. Our job is to tell them which ideas work and do not work in practice, not to flame them for even thinking about trying something new in the first place. I've never seen a community grow so outraged over a dev that is consistently adding new content to their game, it is bizarre!

**TL;DR: It's okay to disagree with Epic on their priorities and to be frustrated when bugs and issues seem to persist for longer than you think they should take to fix, but let's recognize how awesome they are and how cool their game is, and remember the devs are people too -- they all want the game to work just as much if not more than you do.**",FortNiteBR

I am going to express that I myself think it’s a real job and treat it like one.  I work a full time job and stream full time totaling around 88 hours a week.  

I literally put my life into making it work, because streaming is in the entertainment industry something you can’t just get into.  You have to work hard, bust your ass, and grow.  

Nothing about streaming is easy the energy being put into it alone is mentally exhausting.   

Now some people are able to stream and do nothing else to start out with, and even I consider them working.  Having fun doesn’t mean your not working. 

Fortnite itself is a crazy difficult game to stream you have to be good and still entertaining.  Plus the visibility is hard as well, considering the numbers.  

This game is amazing to play absolutely addicting.  Streaming is a pleasure and hyped.   With all that you still have to be on pint energetic and active. To me streaming is a difficult, but very rewarding job.

It's no secret this game is massive at the moment. The same is true for South Africa. The game is everywhere, from casual conversations to tournaments that we attempt to host. The game is rightfully a blast and that's great!


\- What's not so great though?


The best ping we can get is 170ms, to the closest server being EU. The vast majority of Southern African players rock 200 \- 300ms though.

Everyone should stop complaining about the weapon delay. The whole point of it is to prevent double weapon uses. Having double weapon uses just makes that one weapon overpowered and shouldn't really be a thing in the first place like the double pump. It may in some way slow the game down but that's because of people that like to rush and switch weapons all the time. It makes you think of what weapon to use effectively against the enemy instead of switching to 2 or 3 weapons at a time to output higher burst of damage. It makes the game be how it's meant to be. If you don't like it or are one of those people who like to rush switching weapons then that's unfortunate for you, get used to it because I don't think this will change back to what it was.

I don't mind the change, all it does is make me think of what weapons I should be using when heading into a gun fight and what would support me well.",FortNiteBR

Then the Dinosaur banner which is the 99th level of the battle pass.

Then the meteor which was supposedly going to hit Tilted Towers. (But didn't). As you probably know, a meteor hit (and killed the Dinosaurs) 65 million years ago.

Then the egg discovered by u/spar13 under Tilted Towers. And dinosaurs are born out of eggs. 

Idk what will happen, but I would imagine a new location (such as Museum, Dinosaur Zoo or Palaentology site), on the map for Season 4. This would probably be followed by skins (like the Rex skin) and emotes  (Like a dinosaur).

Hi /r/FortniteBR,

After countless of updates that brought new features and a lot of game breaking bugs i think it is time for epic to slow the f#ck down with patches and give us a PTR. Like everyone i'm a fan of new content but i hate the fact that after every patch things go broken.

A PTR will help with :

A more stable build on live
Player feedback on new items/mechanic's/POI's before they will be implemented
Less bugs since Epic has more time to fix it

Epic, we don't need content every 1 or 2 weeks. Give us a PTR and let us play. Listen to our feedback given on the PTR build. Maybe grant people that play on PTR a free skin (guy/girl with a yellow hardhat and a bright traffic vest).

With competitive play around the corner we need this epic. You can't expect Fortnite to turn in a solid game if you keep giving us game breaking bugs, we don't need floating pickaxes, we don't need pick up bugs. We don't need new guns. We need a stable build. Please epic, take your time...

Edit: For those who don't know what a PTR is. It is basicly a server with new content before it is released into the live build.",FortNiteBR

I think that would be a pretty sick reveal for the PVE mode becoming free. Especially if the zombie things from the PVE come out of the comets or you can see that trapped in some sort of container near the comet landing to promote the PVE mode.

History states than millions of years ago a comet cleaned out the dinosaurs, which would clear up the comet heading towards Tilted.

Then recently this was posted: https://imgur.com/a/97RuU

And it looks as though there is something under tilted towers, a lot of people are seeing this as confirmation that, that is indeed the comet. 

However, I think it's some form of dinosaur egg, it would make sense, say the comet potentially hits and in its wake maybe a dinosaur egg is birthed? Now I'm not saying dinosaurs are going to be roaming around wildly like a Steven Spielberg wet dream, but they could very easily create some form of area with huge bones everywhere. This would also link to the recently leaked skins for season 4  (https://twitter.com/TwoEpicBuddies/status/983990885510729728?s=09) one of which is a dinosaur and the backbling to me, looks like a dinosaur coming out of an egg.

Now there's been claims this makes it easier for console players and makes building as quick as PC! 

I'm soooooooooooo used to standard controls as I've been playing since the start and feel like I've finally mastered building quickly. But I really want to try learn this new layout, not sure if its worth the time its going to take me to get used to the new layout vs how many fights/games I'll end up losing whilst trying to learn the new layout lmao.

Lets make it clear. Being 2 shotted by a double pump user isnt fair because the core mechanic of this game is building. And how can you build if someone is constantly fast swapping at you a weapon supposed to have a super low fire rate ? 

That being said, just like building or being abble to read the game situation, fast swapping IS a mechanic. And it is not given to anybody and i think it should stay in the game as something players have to work in order to get better at.

In my opinion the last update is bad because , even if it nerfs double pump ( the current double pump usage is a bug intented to be fixed ) it also nerf the ability a player has to fast switch to his sniper rifle or his Hand Cannon.

------------------------------------------------------------
/ ! \ READ FROM HERE IF YOU DONT HAVE TIME / ! \
------------------------------------------------------------

Those are the problems, here is the solution i though off.

Basically the idea is to add a Diminished Returns on the damage of the pump. 
For instance , if you shoot 3 times on someone by fastswapping your pumps, the 1st shot will deal 90, then maybe 60, then will stick to 45 ( Im using random numbers. Im sure Epic can find good numbers in order to make it feel balanced). This way , your DPS will depend directly on how fast you are abble to switch, keeping the fast swapping mechanic in the game.

For non-double pump users, it doesnt change anything as the pump remain the same as what it was originally.

What happens if im a double pump user and on my 3 shots i miss the second one but hit the 1st and 3rd one ?
2 situations : 
1 - The time between the 1st and the 3rd shot is lower than the natural pump's CD. Then the Diminshed Return isnt reset and the 3rd shot will deals 60 damage ( to take the same example as before)

2 - The time between the 1st and the 3rd shot is higher than the natural pump's CD. Then the Diminished Return is reset and the 3rd shot deals 90 damage ( just like if u were a single pump user )

Again this is just an idea and i know that im absolutely not smarter than any Epic dev. Just let me know if you find this idea good and hit it with a thumbs up if thats the case and be sure to share it. 

Peace out.

I see YouTubers get some insane kills with the Scoped and Burst and say things like, 'Oh! The Burst shreds!' and the next second, they drop it for some Green AR or a Bolt Action

Let us all gather and start a movement for these guns

Btw figure out some hashtag for this in the comments, lmao

Essentially you could wait for your shot to be accurate, then uncrouch, shoot and crouch again to hit one shot and be back behind cover before the opponent can react.

I agree that this mechanic is too powerful and should be nerfed in some way.

Epic made some changes to this in Patch 3.5. They are not mentioned in the Patch notes, so I'm not even sure if they are intentional, but it seems like they are, so I'll treat them as such.
I want to argue, that the way they fixed it is wrong and I will provide a different idea.

**What Epic did in the 3.5 Patch** is, they changed the way the hitbox of the ramp beneath you works. If you try to do this technique now, you will always hit your own ramp and the bullet will not go through to your opponent.

Okay, fine. Now we fixed ghost-peeking. But this also has an effect on another core mechanic.

What about just regular peeking from behind a ramp?
Now you have to expose yourself significantly more in order to not hit your own ramp than you had to before 3.5.

That means the **'high-ground' in general is less powerful now**.
Gaining the high-round in a fight gave you a significant advantage. Now that advantage is smaller, because you have to peek out much further to actually shoot.

Now onto a **suggestion** on how to fix ghost-peeking without nerfing high-ground in general.
What if crouching and uncrouching would make your first shot unaccurate in the same way that moving does?
You could still ghost-peek, but with bloom (which would take away alot of its viability on long range) and you could still peek regularly.

Edit: Additionally they could prevent crouch spamming and for example make it slow down after crouching and uncrouching 3 (or 2?) times rapidly (just like it is with jumping).

In my opinion there is almost always a way to fix a mechanic that is too powerful without lowering the skill cap in general.
Same goes for the quick switching between shotguns, but that's a different topic and there have been good suggestions on reddit for that already.

**TLDR:** Epic's ghost-peek fix has nerfed high-round in general. Suggestion: Make crouch and uncrouch mess up your first shot accuracy. That way ghost-peeking is significantly weaker without messing with the high-ground in general.

BOY HAVE I GOT A CONSPIRACY FOR YOU GUYS.

Aite so listen to this. As of 00:57 UTC Fortnite has been unplayable and i think i stumbled upon the real reason as to why its been down.

I believe that Epic games has purposely rendered the game unplayable. because they are trying to direct the spot light at another game now made popular by streamers like Ninja and Dr.disrespect called RADICAL HEIGHTS. Ninja has been a driving force in the popularity of fortnites success even having his own item in the game the ""plunja"" so there is no doubt in my mind that Epic Games and Ninja and a few other streamers are apart of this master plan.

                 ```HERES WHERE THE CONSPIRACY STARTS```
Epic games is based out of Cary, North Carolina and the studio that owns Radical Heights Boss key productions is based out of Raleigh, North Carolina. Interesting. One of the founders of Boss Key Productions Mr. Cliff Bleszinski was the former design director for. get this. EPIC GAMES. And the other CO founder of Boss key is a man named Arjan Brussee an entrepreneur that in a tweet by Cliff Bleszinski -&gt; https://twitter.com/therealcliffyb/status/939165178398150656 and later confirmed by Arjan here -&gt; https://twitter.com/arjanbrussee/status/939176233245511681

says that he parted ways with The company he helped co found 'boss key productions' to rejoin EPIC GAMES.

I believe that in all the hype of battle royal games Boss key wanted to join the hype and got a little help from their friends at Epic games on the day of April 11 to take the shine off of Fortnite and with the help of streamers to make the main focus on Radical Heights. And this is why i think is the reason behind the unusually long downtime in fornite.

I have 1500+ games played in the short time this game has been alive. I have played every iteration of this game's shooting mechanics, and I strongly believe this patch's update has been the worst version of shooting in this game so far.


Since the beginning of Fortnite, the bloom system has been in place. The first shot accuracy was a great improvement that gave a player with better aim the edge in a shoot out. It is very obvious that Epic is keeping bloom around so that a new player still has a decent chance to kill a decent player due to the randomness of accuracy. However, the key to Fortnite's success has allowed us to counter this: Building


Building in Fortnite distinguishes a great player from the trash players. A strong player used to be able to build a quick ramp and one pump the noob from below. Now we can't even pull our guns out right after building without a ridiculous delay. While it sucks to get stomped by better players over and over, this is how all of us started and how we all learnt. 


While double pump was questionably strong (although still counterable) it allowed for a single good player to wipe out a whole squad. And that is the way the game should be, and it also made for the most exciting playing and viewing experience. Players should be rewarded for better building, and gun control. 


It feels like this patch heavily caters to the new players, it seems like Epic is scared a new player will join a game, get stomped and never touch the game again. However, I insist this is not the case. Getting stomped by a player making a great play only inspired me to learn to outplay the guy that previously was able to kill me.


Epic has made it clear that they fear this game going stale and the trend passing. Weekly additions to the game are an example of this. And with every weekly gimmick we are presented with an abundance of bugs and glitches. However, Epic is missing the fact that the gameplay is what made this game exciting. The gameplay mechanics are being slowed down, leaving players with a very dull experience. 


Patch 3.4 had great shooting mechanics, only lacking in consistency. Why change something that is not broken? I have invested a lot of time and made (optional) purchases in the game that I believed in. And I really fear it will be following down the same path of H1Z1: An extremely popular game that died due to too many changes in the fundamental way the game plays.


I would love to hear your opinions and discussions.


Thanks for reading. 
TLDR: A good player should be able to stomp a squad of new players, but Epic doesn't want this.

tl;dr dud just make it so you can't carry two types of shotguns (i.e. pump-tac, pump-heavy, heavy-tac), two types of smgs, two types of explosives, two types of ars, etc.

I posted about this earlier, but the direction of Epic is to design a game where reloading is an ACTUAL function of the game where you have to do it in order to ACTUALLY be fun while maintaining balance, or what you guys can call a ""delay"". The main complaint I see with most people that is actually considered to be somewhat agreeable is the editing. Although I understand how slower editing results in a slower paced game, but that doesn't justify the broken truth about double weapons. So instead, what I propose is literally just to remove anything that is the same TYPE of weapon. Yes, you heard me: I think pump-tac is unfair, due to its lack of having to reload, because in the end, that is a function that is required in this game. But my only point to not start arguments is just so that we can remove weapon delay, and just make it so double-everything isn't a viable strategy seemed to be okay to the rest of the community. Besides, I think we can agree a fat majority of people who find things like pump-tac perfectly non-broken or balanced are ostentatious 12 year olds looking to find another strategy to get them to post dubs on snapchat.",FortNiteBR

* We asked them to chill out with all the new items and focus on improving the game issues and fixing bugs, they listened and followed suit. 

* We just got an awesome replay feature 

* They nerfed the Guided Missile 

* They got the servers back up for a bit at least 

* Everyone and their mother loves to play Fortnite and it puts a lot of stress on the severs, but when I play I experience relatively little lag 

* Their track record on listening to this awesome community and following suit with answers/fixes is amazing 

What I’m saying is that Epic usually listens to the community within reason, and that we overreact a lot, I know I do. I thought the Guided Missiles and the Vending Machines and the Port-a-Fort where going to be insanely annoying and OP and cater to noobs. I’ve been wrong every time. 

As long as Epic keeps listening to the community and we keep giving them solid advice and less grief then we will continue to have the best game out there right now.

Coming from a ""classic"" CoD background I feel like having more than one of a type of weapon is against the natural order of things and that limiting the possession of dupes will eliminate the whole problem with this double trouble, without ruining the game for the vast majority of the game's population, who don't ever gear themselves outside of these parameters anyway.

I feel like it might be tough to implement these changes on a technical level and there will be bugs a plenty and someone will find an exploit but I'm not a programmer so what do I know.

Vending machines either make high power weapons too easy to obtain or are completely useless.

Port a fort feels so off and wrong, can't quite put my finger on it and would like to hear others thoughts on it.

And of course the recent changes to switches, ignoring what everyone is saying about skill gap (which is valid and true) just makes the game feel clunky.

If I'm missing anything else then let me know. If things I've heard are true that this is following the same cycle as paragon then this games death is inevitable. And i would hate for this game to be a dead clunky mess since it's just so much damn fun.

If you are not landing hits, you build to try counter your enemy and gain the high ground avdvantage. If you can't build either, then what are you supposed to do? Die like a console player? I believe this is why the build ball was added into the game to help assist console users into becoming good players, or at least have their skill level above low now since they are able to build without difficulty.

Designing a system as complicated as Fortnite's infrastructure is probably no easy task. Even with redundancy, you're never guaranteed flawless operation. Sys. Ops. is _hard_. I've built out infra. for a small website (one server) to a large, distributed app (multiple servers/databases/load balancers/you name it) - it's no joke. You can spend hundreds of hours building a ""perfect"" system just for it to fall over at 2 in the morning because of some fault in the hardware your boxes are running on or because you didn't anticipate a traffic spike or... just because ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ seriously... sometimes it just happens.

I've seen comments like ""Epic is rich - just fix the servers."" I hate that. ""Epic is rich."" So? You can't just buy a fix to server issues. Miss me with that garbage. Epic is comprised of people just like you and me who are right now at 11:00PM PST on a weekday.

I watched the Halo sub and the MineCraft sub go down this same path. The community turned on the developers to the point where the devs said outright they refused to visit the sub. anymore - it had become too toxic. 

I'm not saying ""you're _not allow to ever_ be upset that the servers are down (again).""

My issue with using a low dpi is that I cannot do a 180 turn fast as it is too slow to turn around, meaning if I'm shot in the back, i would be halfway to turn around by the time I'm dead.

So how do some players like for example Ninja have such low in-game sens and 800 dpi and manage to turn around so quickly? because they turn the mouse fast to the side since they got big mousepad size? arm movement?

I have a small mouse pad, but I saw this one on Amazon which gives me as much size as I want in my desk.

All these kids clearly just have NO clue how Game Development works...,"It's sad to see such hate and so many rude people just because they can't play their precious video game for a few hours.

Like... The devs created this game to be fun and spread happiness... I mean that's all any game is really for, to spread happiness and positive vibes, but we've got these damned millennials running amuck and turning everything that is good into something bad.

They obviously never learned about game development. I did when I was young, about 8 or 9 years old I started messing around with different programming languages, and I understand that these kinds of things(the emergency maintenance) HAPPEN... To say that a company is trash because something like this happens just shows how young and pathetic you are.

I give big props to the devs for this game! This game is clearly something special. Take BR and add the building and destruction of EVERYTHING? That's a pretty dope combo!

Being able to walk into the Tilted Towers town and LITERALLY break down EVERY building from top to bottom, or take them all out from the bottom and watch them crumble, just makes me hard... What a great idea!

And the graphical style? Amazing! My best friends father is an artist and he often draws this kind of cartoony style. Take the pickup trucks in Fortnite for example. Short and stumpy little trucks with really tall interiors at the front! Super funny, super awesome!

I never thought I'd hear or see myself saying ""the kids these days"" but seriously... The kids these days are so disrespectful and pathetic... I feel like it's because no one disciplines their children anymore so they feel like they can do or say anything whenever they want and get away with it...

If I talked the way these kids do today I would have gotten an ass whoopin let me tell you... These kids today wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes in the 80s and 90s.... EVER... They would have been like ""Where's the quest objective marker on my radar??? How do I know where to go for this quest?!?!?!?!?!?!""

For real....

Props to you devs, you guys have been dealing with a lot of shit lately, but I think you've been doing a great job!

And port-a-fort? That's going to be AWESOME to see in pro-play! All these mediocre kids are complaining that Epic Games is catering to n00bs, but they forget there will be a Fortnite BR pro league, and when a match has ONLY pros in it, they're going to use them too...

Keep up the great work Epic Games! Love you guys!

EDIT: LOL the people commenting are the exact people I'm talking about. Just take a moment guys to think about how rude and terrible you clearly are at life! :) No stress on my shoulders, I hang out with people that spread positive vibes, not negative bullshit like you guys! It's all good. Keep doing it from your mothers basement while you waste your lives away! Epic Games knows whats up. You guys acting this way just makes it even funnier how pathetic the human race has become! :)",FortNiteBR

Long story short, I recently invested into a gaming PC. At the time, there was an issue that prevented me from logging into my account that I linked with my Xbox Gamertag. So to just get playing, I created a new account. 

Fast forward and it seems that the issue that prevented access to my xbox linked account has been resolved. But this is after spending a considerable amount of money on the battle pass + additional skins on my pc based account. So now I have 1 account that is heavily progressed in Save the World and another account with a vast number of cosmetics in Battle Royale.

Ideally I'd like to consolidate accounts and just have 1 login in a manner that wouldn't entail losing the hundreds of dollars I've spent on the founders packs, loot llamas, and cosmetics.

Any insight or help would be appreciated towards my situation or a way to get in contact with Epic.

My kids asked me if they could download and play Fornite one our single PS4 last year around the time the game started becoming really popular. I said sure and downloaded it for them. At this point the two older kids were the only ones playing it but there was always a struggle for who's turn it was. Luckily in the boxing day sales I was able to pick up a second PS4 quite cheap. Now they could play together and I saw how much fun they were having so at night when they went to bed I would hop on and play myself. By this time we all had a few wins each and so were ok players in our own right but we couldn't ever have more than a duo because only two consoles. I then downloaded it on our two computers at home as well so I could play with my youngest while the older two would be able to play squads with their friends. We always talked about how amazing it would be if we had 4 consoles so we could make one family squad. 

...And then it happened. Epic brought out cross-play and our dream became a reality. We played many matches together while we worked on our chemistry. And eventually it happened we won a game. We all were alive at the end with no doughnuts to any of our names. It was a volcano of emotions as we all danced and yelled at our achievement. 

Thank you Epic for making this possible!

TL;DR - Because of cross-play I was able to squad up with my three kids and get a Win.",FortNiteBR

What if.. It isn't a meteor, but in fact a crashing spaceship.. I took note of the **trajectory** that it is going in, and mapped a few places it **\*could\*** crash land. 

[https://imgur.com/a/ZDHod](https://imgur.com/a/ZDHod)

Here you can see the mapped areas that it will possibly land in, because as you can see the **trail** behind it isn't actually facing towards **Tilted Towers**.. but facing towards **Moisty Mires** and **Lucky Landing.**

Perhaps it could wipe out Lucky Landing, because it is not themed well due to its Japanese architect

 [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WZWfVapDZHM/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/WZWfVapDZHM/maxresdefault.jpg)

This flared my interest as well, because as you can see the description of the item says ""***Cleared For Re\-entry***""

perhaps foreshadowing the '**meteors**' entrance to the map, following that.. the new cosmetic skin called ""**Dark Vanguard**"" can be purchased at the store, also hinting at the event that could arise.

Could we have possibly debunked and actually bulls eyed the event that will be happening? What if.. it isn't a meteor.. what if its a new **map update.**

If you find anymore intel regarding my theory.. please contact me on discord with the article of information.

On my PS4, there are only two USB ports, which I connect my keyboard and mouse to. Works great, and I've found that I enjoy building and combat way more on keyboard and mouse. Problem is: I also want to use my headset, which connects wirelessly to a USB dongle. But . . . you see problem #1. 

So I bought a USB hub (link below for your reference). Except when I use the USB hub, my mouse movement becomes extremely stuttered and laggy—to the point that it's useless to use it. Problem #2.

Is this a problem with the hub I bought? Or is the my 5-year-old PS4? Or is this a problem with any PS4 that isn't a PS4 Pro?

You may remember the [Kevin the Cube megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9h8tuv/end_of_season_5_event_megathread/) from last year, and our goal is to replicate that success.

Please keep all discussion for Season 7 in this thread. You may discuss the teasers in their retrospective threads, but any other posts will be removed and redirected here. Existing posts on the front page have been grandfathered, but ultimately continuing to allow the speculation in multiple posts will only make it more difficult for your ideas and theories to be seen by everyone.

This thread will be updated with more info when it becomes available.

So, I just saw the second teaser for Season 7. It looks as if theres someone snowboarding, which obviously depicts something fun and mobile for the next season. However, this holds a double meaning for anyone that might have heard what's going on.

Essentially, Thursday is the VGAs and it's no surprise that Fortnite will be a heavy contender, if not the winner, of game of the year (even though it's from 2017 lul).

Epic tweeted that there will be a big announcement for Season 7 at the VGAs and something ELSE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Now, this could mean a new IP or a new system. A new skin, who knows??? Well, I do.

Someone else tweeted theyd be at the VGAs. Actually, two people did. We know them as the collective, or Russo brothers. Now, for those who don't know these duo, they are the heavy weight brains behind the latest run of Marvel movies, most notably being the latest and greatest, Infinity War. It's also worth noting that we over at r/literallyanymarvelreddit have been BEGGING for a trailer for 4vengers.

Now, some of you may be ahead of me, but hold on. My theory is that Marvel and Epic are going to do a collaborative effort in marketing the next Avengers movie. I'm thinking maybe an in game event where we can all watch it at the drive in?? I'm also making heavy predictions that the Silver Surfer has something to do in A4, since the snowboarder picture looks like the Silver Surfer, which could lead to a Silver Surfer skin as the Tier 100 skin. 

Rebuttals to future arguements:

Q: Marvel has enough money, they don't need Epic to promote for them.

A: Youre right, but Epic has a TON of money too and probably paid good money to have the rights. Also, they did a crossover event once before, featuring our hero Thanos.

Q: That would piss off Marvel guys to have to download Fortnite to watch it.

A: In the first 10 minutes, then its released on YouTube.

Q: Silver Surfer? That is preposterous. He has no need to come to Earth and scout for Galactus. 

A: They're going to set up the next Avengers. Who's scarier than Thanos? Galactus. Also, we dont know what's going to happen in A4. Literally, anything.

TL:DR Epic and Marvel will collab a trailer for A4",FortNiteBR

As a controller player after I experienced winter qualifiers I knew I needed to make the switch to pc if was going to even stand a chance at competing. So I've been playing on pc with a controller for a few weeks now and I've noticed some things. Below I will list the overall categories of the game and compare KB&amp;M to controller.

1. Hardware.
Hardware can determine a huge part of your skill. Running on a 144hz vs a 60hz, 150fps vs 60fps. Hardware can give you the ability to raise your skill level and with bad components you're not going to be as good. So regardless of input there will always be an advantage to those who play on pc.

2. Pace
Whilst switching to pc with a controller has given me the ability to preform better it has also opened my eyes to how much better KB&amp;M players are. From switching guns to throwing down builds, KB&amp;M players can simply transition their momentum much faster. They're just on another level off pace that controller players can't keep up with.

3. Aiming
There's a huge gap in aiming between controller and KB&amp;M. Granted controller has aim assist, its simply just not as strong as a mouse.  With flickshotting and mid-air shots KB&amp;M clearly have the advantage.

4. Positioning
This category is a bit more even but I'd still give it to KB&amp;M. With controller players a huge part of the game is getting the ""jump"" on the enemy. Typically getting behind them or getting to their side. It takes a slight second for a controller player to turn even if he/she spots you. So when you get that ""jump"" your almost guaranteed good damage on the enemy without any tradeoff. This is not the same for KB&amp;M. Simply because they can flick shot. So if you have the jump on a KB&amp;M user and they see you out of the corner of their eye they can simply just flick shot you. 


Based on the categories above I think it's safe to assume controller players are at a disadvantage in pretty much every way. So regardless of hardware the best way to create a fair environment for both KB&amp;M and controller users would be to separate the lobbies based off of input rather than platform. I really hope some devs see this post!",FortNiteBR

I basically don't know how to build so I usually fight from the ground and I generally use existing cover instead of the ramp with a wall behind it like I see most people doing when they fight. I want to improve and I know I need to prioritize building more but I have played so much of this game that I usually fall back to my usual routine so to speak. Has anybody faced something similar?

Why does the pickaxe need to do 20 damage per hit?  No one asked for this.  I get their idea being if you're unfortunate enough to land on a roof late and not get the gun, you have a relavent time to fight back.  Unless your aim is horrendous bad, or you get a shit weapon like a GL, you should win the fight; however, when you eventually kill the opponent, you'll be left you usually 40-60 health, compared to a 70-80 health like before.  That's completely ridiculous considering you grabbed the weapon first.  It should be, if you fucked up your landing and don't get the gun first, you either die or find another place to land quick, not fight before fighting for the chest.  This issue is severely brought about at clock tower landings where at least 3 people land, and it's almost better to stall your landing until the other players kill each other.  Ultimately, the pickaxe buff was a completely unneccessary change that ultimately won't save the unarmed player's life, and it just hurt's the player who got the gun's chances at surviving.",FortNiteBR

I realize the Switch isn't as powerful as the PS4, or even the current high-end mobile phones, but it's certainly capable of running this game in a far better state than it currently is. Just look to any other game that makes use of a LOT of the Switch's power (and servers etc.) - they run from ""pretty okay"" to ""fuckin' great"". Fortnite on Switch though, barely passes for ""playable"" to me. I don't say that to be insulting, I just know that it can be better and I'd love for Epic to optimize it.

The best way I can describe it would be ""choppy"". Gun fights feel choppy/laggy, gliding feels choppy, the sound is extremely choppy/crackly (shotguns to rockets are just distorted beyond all hell), etc. The game just feels very unstable in many respects, and I'm wondering if Epic has addressed this at all/plans to fix it. 

It's odd to me as I'm sure there's a HUGE audience for this game on Switch, and it's just too bad that they're probably not having as much fun as they could be - not to mention I'm sure some people are just turned off and have left the game due to how it currently plays on the platform.

While I agree on the fact that the Enforcers weren't the most productive things in the world in Season 5, they have been doing the exact opposite in Season 6, and if this theory is correct, there will be a massive change to the map or possibly the entire game.

The Visitor is a criminal who escaped from the Enforcers. Thinking the Fortnite island was a safe place to land, he came down but took down Dusty Depot in the process. When the government immediately built up around The Visitor, he knew something was seriously wrong and he knew he had to get the hell out of the Fortnite island as fast as possible before he is caught and taken away by the government.

After sneaking out of the meteor, The Visitor finds a rocket being used as a prop for the Omega vs Carbide film which was in production. The Visitor finds this to be a perfect escape plan, and gets to the rocket. He programs the rocket to travel through time and space, and get out of the Fortnite island. That way, he can travel to a new dimension by using the rifts, and escape to peace, away from the government, away from the Enforcers, away from anyone.

Unfortunately the sky had other plans, and the rocket broke away the sky in the rocket's final launch, creating a huge crack in the sky. Introduce rifts.

...

In season 5 week 7 we found out that the Enforcers brung back the rifted signage back through the rifts. This is where the Enforcers become relevant. The community say the Enforcers were pretty much useless, but I unironically say the Enforcers are one of the most important characters in the Fortnite storyline so far. The community say the storyline is bad - but their mistake is that they're not looking into anything properly.

...

Season 6 has been an extremely important season regarding the future of the game. To many people Kevin floated and made islands but oh my god Season 6 is much, much more than that.

THE WAILING WOODS BASEMENT.

The Enforcers are the police and The Visitor is a criminal. The Visitor destroyed Dusty Depot. He created the rifts. He took the motel sign, the NOMS sign, the Durr Burger, this, that, this, that. The Enforcers BROUGHT BACK THE MOTEL SIGN. The Enforcers were actively trying to fix the Fortnite island by bringing back what was taken by the rifts...

...and bringing back what was taken by the meteor.

As you can see, there is a poster of Dusty Depot in Wailing Woods. There is also a cushion on a chair with the Enforcer logo on it. There is a permanent rift under inspection, and there are teleporters. The Enforcers are tampering with the rift, to make it...

...travel to the PAST, and bring back DUSTY DEPOT and WHAT THE VISITOR HAS DESTROYED including MOISTY MIRE.

When the Enforcers are done, the rift will cause everyone to travel to the past, before Dusty Divot, before Paradise Palms, before The Visitor, before all the carnage and chaos. The teleporters are alternatives to the rift, in case the rift fails, so we have two ways to travel to the past, with the teleporters.

Remember when Fortnite said they'd consider adding new maps in the future? The Enforcers will create the second map, and this second map will be the old map before the meteor.",FortNiteBR

Pretty much nothing has changed for 2, almost 3 seasons and it feels to me as if it's just an unfinished project. Back when the trucks were going around the divot, I assumed it was to fix it up but looks like it was just to make the diner in the depots. And since they made it pretty clear that the old Dusty Depot isn't coming back (through the painting tributes found over the island), they should at least upgrade the divot a little more.

‚Ä¢ If Snowboarding/Skiing really will get implemented, it would be a shame if it only was possible in the snow area. you will probably be able to Ski everywhere.

‚Ä¢ Aurora Borealis. 

Uh? Aurora Borealis. At this time of year, at this time of day, in this part of the country and localised entirely in your kitchen?

yes.

may i see it?

no.

‚Ä¢ The ""Castle"" we can see on the mountain (currently it's nothing more than a Block) will probably be much bigger than it looks right now and will probably be a place with it's own name.

‚Ä¢ As you can see, the island is surrounded by fog and wouldn't it be cool if the snow biome would have this kind of fog sometimes? Just to make the biome a bit more scary.

‚Ä¢ SNOWBALLS! 

‚Ä¢ The Skin showed will not be Tier 1, but tier 100. I mean, look at it. that's the lord of the undead himself, Arthas! 

I basically made this to come back to it after Season 7 drops. Maybe i'll use it at some kind of Bingo. if i get 3 Right, i win.

No pun intended....,So this is my idea on how to stop explosives from being to op. 1) make the damage indicator spread area less so it‚Äôs harder to get hit and it actually takes skill to aim close to the person/object. 2) Make the damage for areal hits less.e.g RPGS On aerial damage do 100 damage. And on contact the rpg does 150. To reward the person for getting a direct hit. 3) remove the damage through walls thing. Make it so there is no damage through walls so less people rage and explosives are less op. But make it so that they do more damage to structures to balance it out. But for the quad launcher and the grenade launcher the same damage to structures because they can be used for spam. 4) stop doubly grenade launcher and other dual explosives. This is to stop spam which in high explosives is probably one of the only ways I‚Äôve been dying. This whole list is just so that killing someone with explosives is now less relying on spam etc and more relying on skill.,FortNiteBR

First I want to start by saying, I play stretched resolution because of my FPS in game, so please don't send hate.

Now, I've been playing the game using 1440x1080 for a few months and I've gotten very used to it, I've been looking into pursuing content creation and I want to start using 1920x1080 again except the few times I've tried switching it just feels like a completely different game and I just feel like a bot, so I guess I just wanted to know if anyone has advice on how to switch back and get used to native res?

SEASON 4: Tier 1- Carbide and Battlehawk  |  Tier 100- Omega

Pattern: M-MALE F-FEMALE

SEASON 4-MMM

SEASON 5-MFM

SEASON 6-FMM

&amp;#x200B;

SEASON 7 MIGHT BE MFF

&amp;#x200B;

HERES WHY DJ YONDER(M) WAS THE FIRST TEASER IN SEASON 6 AND WAS THE BASIC SKIN WHILE CALAMITY(F)

BECAME THE TIER 1 UPGRADABLE CHARACTER AND DIRE(M) THE TIER 100 SKIN SO THE 1ST UPGRADABLE STYLE

IS A DIFFERENT GENDER FROM THE TIER 100 SKIN.

&amp;#x200B;

\---note Season 4 and 5 doesnt count with the different tier 1 tier 100 skin because there were

no current female upgradable character in the battle pass then---

&amp;#x200B;

but the problem with this theory is that

Now that we have the first teaser of season 7 which seems to be a guy could it mean that the

basic skin is him because like dj yonder he was the first teaser in season 6 and he became the

tier 1 basic skin making us have a Tier 1 and Tier 100 female skin

&amp;#x200B;

here are other possibilities if epic tries to be balance and let there be an selectable style male character

(keep in mind i wont add a possibility of a male tier 100 skin)

With the weekly challenges, it makes it even easier to finish it. I propose to make the battle pass a grind again like season 2.",FortNiteBR

I really hope Epic Games can do some sort of tribute in game at minimum for us fans who loved to land at this spot.

Even an LTM gamemode where they bring back the OG map, anything! I feel like Dusty Factories deserves a comeback in game in some way, whether they create a brand new location for it (My suggestion would be to create another one between the Cargo area, Dusty Diner and Tomato Temple.

If it’s killing me too fast, I can’t defend myself and build. I can’t drive a 4wheeler. I can’t fight back. How does one build a fort in fortnite if I feel like I have 10 hp when realistically I have 200 and no shield.",FortNiteBR

shoots once
switches to second gun
shoots once
switches to first
waits for the delay (current delay)
shoots once

115,Sp1ce__,1540918439,9spr49,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9spr49/adrenaline_system_concept/,1,Adrenaline system concept,"So for a while now while playing with friends I will die with 6 or 7 kills to someone with 3. I don’t see how that’s fair. So I always say they need to add an “adrenaline system” where when you get a kill you get some temporary health, that the storm ticks for and caps at 75-100.

So imagine you’re running around, you get a kill, your adrenaline bar jumps up based on how much damage you did to them. So if they were on 25 health, you headshot them with a heavy sniper you get a lot of adrenaline but you body shot them for 30 damage with your ar, you get maybe 10. But you will slowly lose this adrenaline so it would not be op. Imagine if in overwatch the system where players would get “on fire” by getting a lot of kills, it would not just be visual but would also allow you to take more damage. 

But imagine you get 5 kills early on, you leave and someone who just got 2 kills right as you rock up with all your adrenaline gone, it would still be fair as they would’ve taken damage. This would reward good players a lot because if they get a lot of adrenaline without taking damage they would be a tank. It would also mean if someone third parties and takes your kill with a single ar shot, you still get a lot of adrenaline off of it bc you got them to 1 hit. You could then stand a chance against them and it would help with the third party issue we have right now. 

And in squads people always get annoyed at people stealing kills, you would get more adrenaline meaning you could still benefit even if you don’t get the loot. This would also stop people from camping, as they get a kill, they get the adrenaline and they don’t want it to go to waste so they push, get more adrenaline, push, etc. this would help with 1 by 1’ers as it would be a big system to keep people on the move. This health would also be ignored by fall damage so shooting down a build battle would still kill them even if they have max adrenaline. 

If this was added it would most likely be tweaked quite a lot, but as long as the core idea of get kills, get more health temporarily stays, I’d be happy 

And ps epic if you see this feel free to add this 😉😉",FortNiteBR

I don't play fortnight so I have no idea how it works. I heard there is a werewolf skin and werewolves are dope so 8 thought I'd just install the game and buy it but apparantly there is some shit process you need to go through to get it.  Videos say something about challenges and needing so much xp to evolve it. I was wondering of this battle pass is a one time thing where you have only so much time to do whatever the challenges are before it ends. If that's the case and it ends will it ever be available again? Could I buy the thin and just casually play to get it without it going away because I purchased it? Is there anyway to just buy the damn skin? If it does end when does it end? Would I have enough time to do the challenge before it ended. About how long would it take to get the exp needed to get the full skin? Sorry about all the questions havnt popped my fortnight cherry and don't understand anything about how it works.  If you have any answers thank you so much,FortNiteBR

It’s really not that hard.

This doesn’t devalue launch pads, they’re used more like bouncers now to get out of bad situations that you need to glide high for, and is no different than when people used bouncers this way tbh.

Shockwaves have more value to me now imo, now you can bounce up high, and glide on demand.

It’s just so much better this way, if you get a bad drop in trump towers and rng fucks you, just jump out a window and glide to a open building.

And, my stats before anyone calls me bad :P

After this the world is meant to become anew, possibly meaning a new map and two human survivors are apparently meant to repopulate (drift and brite bomber).

The current service on Switch is lackluster. I love to play Fortnite on my Switch and it's the main device I use to do it, and I know this is true for many other people.

As such, some issues need to be addressed.

For one, the lack of a career tab is frustrating. I understand it may strain the game on Switch, but perhaps a potential solution would come in the form of optional free ""DLC"" of sorts one could download from the Nintendo éShop. This would allow players who want it to download it, and for the players who don't (or don't want the potential harm it could bring to the game running properly), it isn't required.

Secondly, I think I certainly speak for everyone when I say I miss the ability to record clips of the game. Whenever I have a moment in game I think is cool, or maybe some one-in-a-million scenario, I'd love to clip it, but do to the fact that it was removed relatively recently, all of my cool moments cannot be saved and rewinded. It would really mean the world to have this reimplemented.

Thank you, and please take these into consideration.",FortNiteBR

So the only way I can compete in your playlist is against them. And your game runs NOWHERE near as good on Xbox. I’m still floating on buildings that can’t even load, my favorite glitch that comes and goes with every update.  Also having a plethora of other performance issues, audio bugs and input lag in these lobbies that puts me at an even further disadvantage,

We hate on this game so much. On streams, this sub, Snapchat and wherever else. Every time we die we feel like it’s not out fault. I’ll be the first to admit that sometimes it isn’t. 

But where would we be without this game? We’d be complaining about different games, to different developers. Those developers wouldn’t have the same amount of community support as Epic does. 

This game has drawn people together more than any other game. I have mates I only see once a week, but we can play Fortnite some nights and talk while we do so. It’s turned some “dead” friendships into fresh ones. 

Its also shown that your game doesn’t have to be AAA rated to be good. PUBG (forgive me for saying) was never a AAA game, and it did well. It’s thunder got stolen by Fortnite, a game made by developers only really known for Gears of War, and even then not super highly. 

Epic Games is now a name known worldwide. The game wasn’t made by Dice, EA, Activision or Treyarch, and it’s still good. Its more popular than their most recent games. It receives ***free*** updates often.

The point is, Epic has created a game which has united the world, and built a culture that it could never have been expected to make. So even if we hate it, even if we complain, even if we scream, cry and break things, we still play it.

So, thank you for an amazing game, Epic.

It all started in season 1. It was a normal island. People from all over moved into this small island. It was one of the only places left that was protected by the heroes and it was an island so what could go wrong. The heroes would train and fight on the island and the people would do their work and mind their own business. Around season two is where things start to become a theory so take this with a huge grain of salt. Around season 2 a huge update came in. Lots of new locations were added to the island. Like Tilted Towers, Junk Junction, Snobby Shores, etc. This brought thousands of people to the island and this is where the outbreak happens. I don't know what started the infection, but my best guess is paranormal but we will get into that later. Anyway, this infection started around the prison. That's why it was one of the most destroyed places. It made the victim very violent, all they wanted to do was kill and eat people. They became yellow in color and very frail. They would run and jump after you. They have a very poor vision but amazing hearing. This outbreak spread like wildfire and spread quickly throughout the island. Most people sought refuge at tilted towers and Wailing Woods. One person went to Junk Junction and put up walls and made a maze out of the cars. He lived for a while but died eventually. The people on the island could only hide because the island was so small that if you shot a gun any shambler would hear it and they tended to cluster up. That's why there is an overabundance over weapons everywhere. The people thought that the mainland would come and help them but they didn't know that they were cut off. They would occasionally send in supply drops with guns and ammo but they couldn't use them without dying to a hoard of zombies. When season 3 came out we saw some new skins in the battle pass. Like the elite agent and the reaper (John Wick). They were sent to get a report on the island and try to help the people. That's why they made the \*Silenced\* SMG and the \*Silenced\* Pistol. So they could kill zombies without alerting a hoard. They didn't help much and they reported to the mainland that the island was a lost cause so they were completely cut off. At this time you could see a meteor coming towards the island. It hit Dusty depot and made a huge crater. This wiped out a lot of the zombies' people they were another problem... Food. Most people raided the farms but those ran short quick. People at Pleasent park resorted to cannibalism and tried to cover up the fact by keeping their name and not releasing these killings. You can still hear the ghosts of the dead ones. They cry out and sometimes open doors at random. Anyway when the meteor came down a bunch of heroes came with it. This got most of the peoples hopes up but the dark secret is. The heroes were the villains. let me explain. So they set their mansion and the ""Villain"" set up his lair near the ocean of Snobby shores. So he tried to build a rocket ""destroy"" the island but all he was doing was trying to leave the island. He tried to make contact with the mainland but the ""Heros"" Sabitasied his rocket and he created the rift in the sky which brought them here. The heroes eventually died off from the plague and the world got even worse from there. The rift in the sky brought horrors from another world. These things could take many forms. Mostly a teddy bear or a scarecrow with red eyes. They could make a man go insane, it would kill people at random. Gave them the plaque. Now we will get this in a minute but let me explain the skins for season 5. They were all bandits, Anarchists, killers. At this point in time, most of the population was dead. Most were wiped out by the zombies or other people. Some factions started to form around the island. One was a village in the mountains of Vikings that came through the rift. They stuck together for a while until the tomato king came and killed them all. The tomato king was a cannibal that tortured anyone who wouldn't convert to their tomato religion. The thought that the tomatoes were holy because they were the only things that grew on that hellish ground. Around this time, the man at Junk Junction was killed from something. The anarchists made the Lazy Links their hideout of sorts. They had water and golf carts to get around faster. They quickly got killed off by the Tomato King. The cube is something I can't explain but It did bring zombies to the island which you can fight so yeah. Season six skins are the zombie hunters. They come from beyond the rift hunting this parasite that has infested the world. Hence the name Dj Yonder. Now that's it for now when more updates come out I will for sure cover those and see how they link to this mystery. If you have questions, concerns,  please leave feedback below. If you want to contact me I play on Xbox one my gamer tag is mc crafting1 haha yeah funny name I know. I can give you a better explanation and show you in-game all of my findings so yeah. I hope to have a great day and happy hunting! ",FortNiteBR

We were there for him when we strutted around the island showing off his new fancy hat. We even saw him get acne! But, eventually he must of got bored of us since he brought friends to the island. Through good times and bad, we were always there for Kevin, we let him take his time, we cheered him on no matter what. But now, it looks like the end is neigh for our friend.

I really need your help. First of all I want to mention that I tried nearly everything regarding YouTube videos and optimization of the in game settings to maximize my FPS but nothin helps. 

I play on a GTX 1080 with an i7-6700k. 
My benchmark is 98.3% above the average. At the same range as an 4K gaming pc. 

But my FPS in Fortnite are so bad, I mean I’m
playing fortnitemares with approximately 60-100 FPS. 

AND I EVEN PLAY ON STRETCHED. 

I have a 144 hz monitor. 

I’m having these issues on CS go too. My Fortnite settings are low. 

I maximized the NVIDIA settings to performance. 

Task manager tells me everything is okay. It seems like it bottlenecked or something. I even unparked my CPU’s. 

Sorry for my bad english. 

And thanks in advance for every help.

However, it also changes how the game is played. For one, it causes more people to be alive at final circle, it can be used a bit too defensively where you almost never have to engage anyone if you don't want to. It also makes launch pads a bit less useful, but I don't mind it too much.

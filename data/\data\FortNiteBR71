* ""People should be matched on their K/D""
* ""That guy was a bot, I could 1 v 1 him any time""
* etc.

But the point is, Fortnite isn't a 'kill the most people' game, it's an 'outlive the most people' game.

Did you die to someone pushing you in the storm? That doesn't mean they're a bot, it means you didn't prepare well for rotation.

Did a bush camper snipe you when you had 13 kills? You were making yourself conspicuous.

Plenty of games reward aim and combat tactics. I like Fortnite because you can use strategy and deception.

It's like K/D players are playing old-school single player games like Doom and Turok, while campers/hiders are playing MGS on stealth mode. Everyone can have fun.",FortNiteBR

Yes, occasionally I get a few hitches, lag spikes, or other bugs posted here, but they happen very infrequently and haven’t been a game-changer in any of my matches so far.  My builds feel smooth, very few ghost shotgun shots, and stable ping between 20-30 (Ethernet, NA servers). All the new animations and quality of life changes lately have also been the cherry on top. 

On the other hand, I’ve been playing since season 2 and have always felt like I don’t experience all the same issues and bugs that the online community seems to experience, at least to the same degree.

I don't want to be an hypocrite but the mobile aim assist is too much.

Also, 90% of mobile players just stand still when attacked.

Now, what i am suggesting ISN'T the nerf of the Aim assist on mobile, but rather the reversing of the changes or a matchmaking playlist option, as to choose your opponents. (without the ability for console to go into PC or viceversa)

For example: 
-Switch/Switch
-Switch/Ps4
-Switch/Xbox
-Switch/Ps4/Xbox
-Mobile/Switch
-Mobile/Mobile
-Ps4/Ps4
-Ps4/Xbox
(Console/PC only available through cross platform parties.)

Mobile Players are both boring and annoying, because their aim assist is absurdly precise at times, and even then they are dumb and slow as rocks, so it's even more infuriating when they get you.

Please, These changes are some of the ones i hated the most.",FortNiteBR

I want to keep playing Fortnite, I prefer the core game over Apex personally, but I'm tired of building.

This update was really mixed. There were so many good things, yet so many bad things that came with it, some that fit in both categories too.

For starters, The Getaway LTM is coming back with new rewards to earn. That’s a good thing, it encourages players to play the game more and earn these rewards, and they’re bringing back a great skin (Wildcard) to come with it too.

However, now there’s only 8 people allowed on a Creative map. Are you serious Epic? I designed a lot of my maps for 16 people, but now it’s just been reduced to 8. Can we at least get an option to change that, for smaller maps?

The Baller is fun to use, just like how I felt like when the Driftboard came out. It’s only balanced because it can only do damage when running into people, and I haven’t encountered any bugs **yet.**

However, Elite Agent and Renegade Raider got new styles. Don’t get me wrong, I love the styles, but now people are gonna be asking for new styles for basically every single battle pass skin. What if I didn’t want to advance in the season 3 battle pass because I was disappointed that Elite Agent didn’t have a selectable style where I could take her hat off? Then I go on this morning to see that she has a style now. I don’t even know what they did with Renegade Raider, but now everyone’s gonna be asking for her back.

The new consumable animation we’ve been waiting so long for is finally here, and it looks great. I’m so glad Epic finally added it, it makes the game look more clean, and using meds is more satisfying.

However, the Infinite Dab emote duration in the lobby got increased again. Every update they do this, and there’s about 50 posts (not even overexaggerating) about it. Please, just shut up, we know, we read the patch notes.

They removed the common rarity Infantry Rifle. I finally won’t get it out of chests anymore, the loot pool will finally feel more available and open to basic weapons like Assault Rifles and Shotguns.

However, the Vending Machine change happened. Now, they won’t even cost materials, and it’s first come first serve. I don’t see a point in this, no one was complaining anymore, it was so easy to gain materials, but they changed it to this. Should we just get rid of pickaxes at this point?

Elimination credit is now rewarded to whoever dealt damage last. THANK GOD. I’ve been waiting for longer than 8 seasons for this to come out, and it’s finally here, in this update. Whoever at Epic thought of this, I love you (no homo).

However, they nerfed the Heavy AR. They’ve made it less rare, and it deals less damage now. That’s really disappointing, since it was meant to be found in higher rarities. That’s why it was so good, it was more rare.

But they nerfed the Heavy AR. Ok, let me explain here. I admit, I eventually got sick of the Heavy AR. I got sick of literally everyone using it (even though I used it), and got sick of getting killed by it. I guess it makes sense now that it got nerfed. Now you’ll be finding more of it, along with less Infantry Rifles, which is what we’ve been asking for for a long time.

Now that I’ve gotten over all the bad stuff, let’s go over the rest of the good stuff.

There’s more Creative islands. I guess if we were going to get more Creative islands, we’d have to have less players, which I guess makes sense enough.

Capture objectives in Creative are here. Also, they’re the Durrr Burger and Pizza Pit mascots. Need I say more?

The new prefabs are as awesome as all the others, some I’ve been waiting for for a while, and some I never knew existed.

So many bugs were finally fixed.

Yeah, mods can remove my post now. Thank you r/FortniteBR, very cool!",FortNiteBR

When you look and the higher lvl gameplay every shot needs to count But you need to be able to consistantly outbuild your opponent. 

I was using a low sensitivity for more accuracy, when I got Some points in the gauntlet event and the games became more scrim matches I started to value building a lot more.

I used 400dpi and 0.10 in game.
Now I use 400dp 0.14 in game.

Im still getting used to it, But i am getting used to it for the more competative gameplay.
What is your opinion about sensitivity?

I experience this myself as well. And I think introducing a Trios mode solves some of these issues

Now for your reference, I almost always play squads with three people in total. This usually wasn’t that much of a problem and getting wins was possible. However with the current amount of skill involved and all of us being busy with other things than Fortnite, having to constantly do 3v4’s, turned every casual game into a sweat fest.

Now don’t get me wrong, I understand a bit of skill and challenge is needed in this game. But in the current state of the game, one person just makes too much of a difference to have a fair fight. That’s why I think a permanent Trios  mode is needed to make games more fair and enjoyable for everyone.",FortNiteBR

It sucks, and I totally admit there are times where I die and go “ fuck another sweaty no life what a loser “. 

But the way the building mechanic works in Fortnite is the reason there are sweats at all. Building and editing creates a gigantic skill gap between new and experienced players. It allows for people who have put hours into the game to have their hours count. In my opinion, this is how the game should be.

I feel like the reason why “ sweaties “ are becoming such a prevalent topic nowadays is because it’s been long enough since the release of Fortnite for many players to get a good grip on the game and to “ master “ its mechanics. The overwhelming majority of players however, are casual. So this skill gap between casuals and sweats keeps widening as time goes on, as new mechanics and techniques are found out to improve gameplay.

I also think this is why so many people hold up the old seasons on such a high pedestal.  Not only were they simpler times, but players just weren’t as good back then. And so the skill gap between players was much closer together. You were never going up against people that you were literally powerless against because of their building prowess.

TLDR: Sweats are a result of how long the game has been out, and the depth of the building and editing mechanics allowing for player expression and growth. It’s impossible to close the skill gap without making the devoted “ sweat “ player base feel cheated",FortNiteBR

As the title asks.... When you jump from the battle bus at the start of the game depending when you jump you will sometimes be what looks to be awarded a number of materials e.g.

&amp;#x200B;

37 Wood

40 Brick

19 Metal

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't been able to find anywhere the breakdown on why and when you jump you get allocated a handful of materials? The second part is when I have been what looked to be given materials when I land I dont have them.?

Has anyone else noticed this? Can anyone shed some light?

I’m sick and tired with this subreddits hate for players that are better than them, literally when anyone even shoots at someone and proceeds to pull out their blueprint the entire community goes “oMG tRyHaRd nO LifE SoCcEr SwEaT GeT oFf tHe GaMe.” Just because someone is better than you or plays more competitively doesn’t mean you should hate them, you can by all means rage when you die but don’t blame it on the fact that he/she was a tryhard or that they were skilled at the game. I get it games are supposed to be fun however just because someone outplays you or acts like a sWeAt doesn’t mean they should stop playing or switch up there play styles just to so that little Timmy can get a win. This community gets angry when someone builds or shoots at them , players will improve and so should you. 
I’m not even going to talk about wanting counters to building, that’s a whole separate thing.
You have full right to feel a certain way about my statement but rather than just saying “LmAo SwEaT gEt A lIfE” try and engage in a meaningful discussion, and by all means you can bring up similar topics related to this one.

I just don't see a reason that they shouldn't come back considering every style challenge has been permanent starting in Season 5. It was such a difficult thing for players to get to level 80 in Season 4, and especially difficult for Switch players (such as myself) starting out since you only had less than a month to grind the entire battle pass and reach season level 80. Basically if you had anything to do at all during this time, you had almost zero chance to obtain the lights.

TLDR: Asking for Omega/Carbide challenges to come back doesn't make you ""entitled"". There is literally no reason the challenges shouldn't come back, and it isn't going to cause any problems if they do.

I believe the game is as balanced as it as ever been and rewarding good players for their skill it's a good thing.

I am a very competitive person and as someone who can't spend countless hours playing this game every day, it's not fun to get destroyed every single lobby. I accept that the player that killed me is better than me but takes the fun away and making me think that it's not worth it anymore. It's as if I was addicted to some drug that I don't enjoy anymore but can't get rid of.

Your response might be to practice and get better but honestly I don't have enough time to do that. As I've seen today, you need to make Fortnite your part-time job in order to win or to have fun. That's not cool.

It's absolutely necessary for Epic implement SBMM or Ranked to keep players like me and I think they nailed it the past week. It seemed balanced and I could enjoy playing knowing that some TTV wouldn't destroy me in every lobby and that winning a game could be in my control. I want to feel that control to have fun but I can't spend countless hours practicing this game.

Also please stop merging console players with PC lobbies in normal tournaments or at least give us the option. If I'm really good and want to go against the best then fine, but I don't want to start a game on a clear disadvantage.

I know all of this has been said before but while before I was still compelled to play, nowadays I'm thinking about quitting the game as it's not fun anymore and that's why I'm giving Epic another call. Obligatory sorry for the long post.

There is way too much mobility in this game, and it is the reason why you are constantly getting third partied. It is extremely difficult to play a match without getting third partied unless you camp. It makes the game just extremely toxic and unplayable, and the whole match can be thrown completely to bad luck. I understand there will be third partying regardless, but in its current state you are pretty much in a constant battle the entire match, which is a big problem.

I think a lot of mobility should be removed. This point will be very controversial, as even I love using these, but the biggest offenders of the mobility problem is the driftboard, canons, and of course gliders. I accept the quadcrasher because it has more of skill gap, with the timing of your partner hopping, and flying with it requires practice. As for everything else, I think they ruin the game. The canons however have a simple fix which is that just removing the ability to launch from it, only firing. Driftboards and gliders, I'm sorry even though I love both, they gotta go.

• Prior/Current Bloom is a handicap and forces shotgun fights, Any thing beyond 25-30 meters has a insanely large bloom pattern, No control over various ranged fights with ranges weapons from the AR's  


• Sub classes within individual weapons is dumb, For example 2 equally skilled players using green pump vs blue pump makes partial damage or full hits a big difference even if the there is 5 dmg difference and a quicker reload time by 2ms which means a quicker follow up shot with a blue pump and more damage.  


• Random Health, It is very clear a 200hp player can play sloppy against a 100hp player and still win a shotgun fight unless the 100hp player has god aim or build skills but if equally skilled its your fault for being 100hp away from his, It's B.R so i accept this.  


• RNG You either land and find a pistol or walk over next door to a house that has a player with a 50 shield and a blue pump ready to murder you.  


• Poorly balanced head shot multipliers, It is not fun taking any weapon to a shotgun fight cause head shots just tickle health and body shots are a joke so if the other player has 200hp than R.I.P if player Pump shots you accurately.    


• Bloom was already stated but all weapons decrease damage with range? Why in the world would the damage decrease when it is nearly impossible to aim at longer distances with luck.  


• Structures are paper thin now and easily broken, Forces you to make immediate stressful decisions when getting spammed down in duos/Squads and back in the day you could manage to breathe a bit, So now the game requires a insane I.Q level to rely on Edits and temporary cover Which makes fights feel rushed now. ""Just admitted i am to dumb to out smart sweats who breathe this game""  


• I build and edit 100x faster now and have better aim than my S3 days but there seems to be someone 20x better than me towards end game, Please add a proper SBMM with various gaps of skills that are not insanely far apart. ",FortNiteBR

I'm going to put my issues in sections so it is easier for me to format. (I play PC keyboard and mouse) 

**Weapons** 

1. Tac Shotgun - This is the most awful gun in the game. Awful to play against and super inconsistent to play with. Multiple times I've been using this gun (early on because they are everywhere) it will either do 20, 67 or 150 ish damage. this wouldn't be a problem if it was consistent which it is not. I can shoot with an enemy entirely in my cross hair and do 12 damage but then from a mile away someone can do 70 plus damage. I hate this weapon and want it gone. 
2. SMGs (all of them)  - I hate guns with easy play and high reward. So little skill goes into an SMG and everyone uses them. It is so easy to just spam through walls and SMG and pump combo. Its boring, easy and obnoxious. At least with the mini gun now it has a cool down but SMGs (especially epic and legendary ones) don't all they have is their 2 second reloads (if that). Personally I want them all gone but id be happy to see all of them have a nerf to damage overall but mainly less damage to buildings because i hate being spammed.
3. TNT - This is a bug but its happened consistently to me. When a TNT is thrown and explodes it seems to teleport me through my buildings (even when they aren't being destroyed) and i take both the TNT's damage and some fall damage (I think its that because I've been losing more health than shields) Pls fix
4. Pistols - (as in regular pistols and silenced pistols) I think these all should get an accuracy buff because it would allow for more varied game play and not the consistent brain dead pump/SMG combo. 
5. Hand cannon - Please decrease the accuracy when jumping and shooting. I'm so bored of someone jumping and getting a 150 head shot because the Hand cannon has insane accuracy when you jump. 

**Options** 

1. Just a small annoyance here but recently the swap current item thing when you double tap pick up is annoying and has got me killed because its messed up my load out.
2. Scroll wheel sensitivity - recently my scroll wheel has been skipping some weapons and in close quarters combat that kills you. Please add a sensitivity for changing weapons with scroll wheel. 
3. I use the visualise hearing a lot because I'm bad with surround sound and I like listening to music. Can you add a graphic for the cannon as currently it is the old kart icon and its confusing. Also can you add an option to turn off emote sounds as well?  

**Vehicles** 

1. Cannons -When firing out of the cannon can you please make it destroy any building that is in front of you and still fly off as a cannon ball? In one of the pirate camps the edge of the window clipped me and made me take fall damage and eventually die as I was running from a team.
2. Drift boards - Please make it so you cannot get 100% accuracy when using balloons and a drift board. I think the reason why is clear. 

**Building**

1. I hate building so much. Why on earth can you place 90% of a ramp into a hill? please for the love of god fix this.
2. Editing - Please make it so editing has a unique sound (or icon for visualise hearing). I find editing ""plays"" scummy and just boring and most of all irritating.

This has become more of an issue recently, but has been slowly becoming more and more of an issue since s6/s7

Ranked mode is not a silver bullet, because sweats aren't guaranteed to queue in it because they may want high kill games, not want to wait years to find a match, or want to squash people of lower skill.

We could replace team rumble with 50v50 if we want to keep a large team mode around. That should be fine as this wasn't a problem back when 50v50 was permanent.",FortNiteBR

Before you downvote hear me out. Building should be nerfed in normal games. Here’s why:,"Recently I’ve seen people complaining (myself included) about the overly sweaty competitive environment that surrounds normal solos, duos, and squads. I think this is because of the excessive use of building in games. People prioritize building over anything else in the game making your chances on winning or having a good time relying on whether you can spam 90s or whether you can triple ramp floor somebody. This makes playing with your friends especially not fun because you will most of the time run into a guy or a full team of soccer skins and TTV kids.

I have an idea that will make normal games more casual but will still quench the competitive thirst of soccer skins and TTV kids that love to show off their “skill” in building. 

Reduce the building cap in normal games from somewhere like 200-300 and normalize the cap to around 600-800 in skrims, other competitive modes or a ranked mode of epic decides to add one which would give a way for competitive people to practice. That way it will divide the casual community and the competitive community into their own separate games so they can play how they want instead of cramming both into one. It would give an incentive for competitive players to play skrims snd such so they could show off their building skills as they please.

If the building cap was reduced even lower in normal games, building wouldn’t always be prioritized 24/7 and would have to use their mats wisely. This way people could play a bit more laid back and won’t have to worry about anyone building a giant tower whenever you shoot them once because it would drain them of mats and they would be forced in a way to play more casually but at the same time wouldn’t force that competitive environment that plagues every game. People can still play competitively to a certain extent in normal games but it would be slightly more laid back.",FortNiteBR

but on this sub, i see people talking about how they just want a casual experience and they think a ranked mode is going to solve that. how? you realize that if you’re going up against 100 people with a similar skillset, most trying to rank up, you’re going to have to sweat, right? and the regular playlists would still have people of all skill levels in them, because most people don’t want to face players of the same skill level at all times.

so what does this sub want? what does this sub define as a “casual” experience? i would think that a casual experience is just playing the regular modes and not giving a fuck whether you win or not, but apparently that’s not the case. you’re still going to get shit on in a ranked mode, you’re just *probably* not going to go up against people that are so far ahead of you that it’s not even a question who comes out victorious. 

tldr: a ranked mode isn’t going to solve your problems if you just want to play casually. maybe this sub needs to think about what they really want out of this game and work towards that? i’m just trying to see what this subs line of thinking is.",FortNiteBR

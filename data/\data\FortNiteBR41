There is no point in even trying,The new LTM is really great and I really enjoy it UNTIL the last stone spawns. It's literally impossible to pick it up because the entire server is fighting where the stone landed that if even getting close to it is an insta-death. Even thanos himself dies in 5 seconds when he gets close to the stons. Everyone is just spamming their weopons on the stone which is something I don't know how they haven't considered when testing the mode. This makes it impossible for Chitauri team to win the mode. Epic please look into this,FortNiteBR

Epic said they removed shield and mats per kill because of ‚Äútoxic aggression‚Äù that was supposedly decreasing the quality of the game. While it‚Äôs nice to think that epic had intentions of improving the game this is also the same company who put zombies in their game for a substantial amount of time and have ignored countless bugs and balance issues. Nobody I know was upset at all about that patch, in fact we were all starting to switch over to apex before it came out. IMO it was one of the best updates the game has ever seen. So I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone knows if there was a substantial drop off in the amount of people playing the game during this time period?",FortNiteBR

So in patch 8.4 and 8.5 we‚Äôve gotten 3 new bunkers, one at retail , one at pleasant and one at salty (not sure, someone posted about it). 

What if there was a reason behind this?

It was right in front of our faces, most of us know there‚Äôs gonna be a big event soon, probably the volcano explodes or something with the loot lake runes , but I haven‚Äôt seen anyone talk about this.

Bunkers are created for a specific reason, Incase a world ending/dangerous catastrophe like a nuclear bomb , or major earthquake, or maybe even a volcanic eruption, a bunker will protect you from it.

With the new technology in this generation, scientists can predict stuff like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and nukes are also detectable. This same reasoning could be applied to the fortnite universe.

What if there was a danger warning, and all neighborhoods (pleasant, retail, salty) are going to have to shelter in the bunker when said catastrophe happens? 

I have some supporting proof/theories to prove this

1. The retail row house with a bunker had a dog house. If you land there, then you‚Äôd notice the dog house has been moved to the bunker. This has a high chance to be because of the dog‚Äôs life and in the bunker he‚Äôll be safe from the event

2. The pleasant park bunker has gold coins and a bunch of tech at the bottom. The dude that lives here probably brought all of his riches down into his bunker and also a bunch of tech/computers to monitor the bunker etc. this one is more of a stretch so bare with me

The main three neighborhoods are Pleasant, Retail, Salty, other neighborhood/ residential areas include Titled, Snobby, Paradise. If these get a bunker then my theory is even more backed up.

Other areas of the map have various bunkers near them, example the ‚Äúinfamous‚Äù wailing woods bunker which if I‚Äôm not mistaken still stands near sunny steps.",FortNiteBR

##**Excerpt from Patch Notes**:

&gt;**Limited Time Mode: Endgame**

&gt;Thanos and his Chitauri invade the Battle Royale island, in search of the six Infinity Stones.

&gt;**Mode Details**

&gt; - Endgame features a team of heroes fighting to stop Thanos and his Chitauri from claiming all six Infinity Stones.

&gt; - Both teams respawn when eliminated until the other side completes their objective.

&gt; - On one side is the Hero team. Heroes respawn when eliminated until the enemy team has found all six Infinity Stones.

&gt; - Heroes start with a treasure map that leads directly to a Mythic Avengers item.

&gt; - Other Avengers items can be found in Chests throughout the map.

&gt; - The goal for the Hero team is to destroy the Chitauri army and defeat Thanos.  

&gt; - Team Thanos is comprised of Chitauri Invaders and Thanos himself.

&gt; - Chitauri Invaders start with a powerful laser rifle, an anti-structure grenade attack, and a jetpack that lets them briefly leap high into the air.

&gt; - The first Chitauri to recover an Infinity stone will be transformed into Thanos.

&gt; - Thanos has a powerful punch, a destructive beam attack, and the ability to jump high into the air and then smash anything in his way when he comes back down.

&gt; - Each time an Infinity Stone is claimed, Thanos' abilities grow more powerful and the Chitauri gain health.

&gt; -   Reality Stone (Red) = Heath &amp; Shields doubled (1000-&gt;2000)

&gt;     - Soul Stone (Orange) = Siphon activated (grants Thanos shields only)

&gt;     - Mind Stone (Yellow) = Jump height doubled

&gt;    - Space Stone (Blue) = Ground Pound AOE size tripled, damage x6

&gt;     - Time Stone (Green) = Big knockback added to each hit, damage x3

&gt;     - Power Stone (Purple) = Laser damage x6

&gt; - If Thanos is eliminated from the match, another Chitauri will become him after a short wait (unless Thanos is the last one standing).

&gt; - If Thanos &amp; the Chitauri find all six Infinity Stones, Heroes will no longer be able to respawn.

&gt; - The goal for Thanos and his army is to find the stones and then eliminate the remaining heroes.

I practice my aim in aim trainers and I practice building in creative, and I play play play and I still just get dumped on by people with ease. It's so discouraging it makes me want to scream.

I'm just so exhausted from the way the game is in genera tool. I try and hot drop for more one on one practice, but I'll run through an entire house and never ever find a gun, and just end up getting one pumped by the person who lucked out and landed on a shotgun.  

I'll try and land safe and farm up/play it safe for late game, but either get pushed by some aggro spastic player who I can't defend against, or make it to top 5 and get killed some person who has 10+ kills who makes it seem like it was the easiest thing in the world.

This game is infuriating and I don't think I can take it anymore. I've never played a game that has made me feel so inferior, so inadequate in my abilities and left me feeling so insanely frustrated. I just can't do it anymore. 

But the messed up thing is I can't bring myself to stop. It's addicting, and I WAN'T to be good but I'm just not. I can't stop playing, but if I don't stop I feel like I'm going to lose my mind. I. HATE. THIS. GAME.

&amp;#x200B;

Although the requirements are shown on the website, would players be interested in an update in them?

for example

 \- same platform merging enabled

 \- new dates for console merging (after September 28)

 \- merging between xbox and switch enabled

&amp;#x200B;

These are just my instant suggestions and I am sure there are many more.

‚ÄúThey work really hard - what more do you want!‚Äù

‚Äú Stop complaining. The devs are trying their best!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the communities fault that the developers are forced to work as hard as they do!‚Äù

No. It‚Äôs not the players fault that the developers are worked as hard as they are, it‚Äôs the *upper management.* 
Those are the guys putting pressure on the developers to hit targets, exceed expectations, drop everything to focus on something etc. 

As players, we still have every right to provide the developers with constructive criticism and feedback to try and contribute to the overall game. We are the ones that rightly complained about the Mounted Turret (pre-nerf), got the Infinity Blade removed from the game, provided feedback on explosive damage through structures and much more. 

I get the impression that some people *may* start criticising other players for posting legitimate bugs to this Subreddit, saying things like ‚ÄúStop complaining. They can‚Äôt fix everything, they‚Äôre already worked hard enough as it is!‚Äù.

We still have every right to voice our opinions and be heard. It is not the players fault if he or she wants a better performing game and a better experience overall.",FortNiteBR

I've never faced criticism like this before, because I've never made a mistake like this before. I'm surrounded by good people and believe I make good decisions, but I'm still a human being. I can be wrong. I didn't do it for views. I get views. I did it because I thought I could make a positive ripple on the internet, not cause a monsoon of negativity. That's never the intention. I intended to raise awareness for suicide and suicide prevention and while I thought ""if this video saves just ONE life, it'll be worth it,"" I was misguided by shock and awe, as portrayed in the video. I still am. I do this sh\*t every day. I've made a 15 minute TV show EVERY SINGLE DAY for the past 460+ days. One may understand that it's easy to get caught up in the moment without fully weighing the possible ramifications. I'm often reminded of how big of a reach I truly have &amp; with great power comes great responsibility... for the first time in my life I'm regretful to say I handled that power incorrectly.

In light of the new article, we have learned that the devs at epic are treated like dogshat to push out updates to keep the game relevant. These updates are usually terrible, coming with game breaking bugs and a lot of mechanics that are just disliked by most of the players. This only leads to the devs having more work to fix the bugs and to get ready for next week's update. 

My proposal: Season 9 (or season 10 considering that season 9 is already all planned out by now), should be kind of an offseason. Let your employees work normal hours trying to just fix the bugs, with no new content having to be pushed out (maybe push content once every month, and not huge changes, but little changes that won't completely change the meta and break the game). This will give some rest to your employees and allow them to efficiently fix the current broken state of the game while not having to add new content. I really do believe having a game that stays the same for a while, while not being littered with bugs is better and more fun than a game that is littered with bugs and changes constantly. 

So pretty much: give your employees a break, stop pushing new content every other week, and let them do their job without having to be in the *crunch* environment.

Also, thanks to you Epic employees for all your hard work and dedication to the game and the community :)",FortNiteBR

BR however has a large map with loads of possibilities. Having a different circle in each game makes for a unique experience pretty much every time. 

Food Fight: Deep Fried lacks replay-ability, something that Team Rumble, 50v50, heck, even Air Royale is pretty replay-able.

This lack of replay-ability makes Food Fight boring, and not much fun to play.

Players enjoyed Team Rumble because of the respawns, high kills, different zones and the general BR feel.

I've tried to keep this as far from a rant and as close to a review as possible, hopefully Epic can take note.

I completely understand the statements that Epic has recently come out with about being overworked, but surely a quick, simple LTM swap out can't be that bad.",FortNiteBR

The way things have developed and how Epic Games has abused this rotten work system is not your fault guys, if bugs aren't resolved is not the devs fault, it's the managers and execs fault because of their neediness of pushing new content practically every week or 2 weeks. Reading the article I noticed that the work abuse that developed in Epic Games was the result of this need to push new content so much that the developers couldn't work properly around the game, to the point they sometimes, more frequently now, recieved notice of this new content with little time to no time at all to work on it, sometimes even not receiving notice at all of what was going on and working for hours on it because the high execs just asked for it. So, my suggestion is, send good wishes through social media (Twitter, reddit, etc.) Make the devs know you are grateful for what they are doing, while doing this you are calling out at the same time the executives because you are not thanking them, you are thanking the actual workers. Want to punish the men in the high castle? Wanna punish Tim Sweeney? Don't buy skins for some time, make them see the profit drop, don't buy a battle pass next season, go even the long mile and stop playing the game as a way of protest. Make their numbers on Twitch stale, don't watch the WC, even if you want to. Let them know that we, as a community, are angry and bothered for this work abuse situation and won't take it lightly. Remember that the game is where it is, not only for the hard work the devs are doing, but for us, the community, we are the ones that control what happens to the game in any term. If we stop playing and make their numbers and profit drop, let me assure you, they will notice. Make them know on social media why you haven't bought skins and why you aren't playing, make the world know that this is not because you don't like the game, but because you hate what the company, Epic Games, is doing, and refuse to play unless this situation changes. If you want to change this rotten work system, start supporting smaller studios and independent game developers, to balance out how the money is divided in the industry.

I know a lot of you here hate this change with an absolute passion, and I can understand why. However, I believe the removal of siphon has been good for the overall game. Now that siphon is just in arena most of the competitive players are just playing arena. This has meant that the people playing normal solos, duos and squads are no where near as good as they were before. While siphon was in the game pubs were very very hard, so much so that no causal players would want to play it. Now all the good players have moved to arena because of siphon, pubs have become a playlist where the casual players can actually enjoy the game. The point of pubs is to be the casual game mode and that is exactly what it is at the moment. Honestly I thought I would hate playing without siphon again, and it did take a bit of getting used to. However once I'd played a few games I realised I was really enjoying it because I didn't have to go super try hard every game. I could enjoy the game in a more relaxed fashion. This was the whole purpose of removing siphon and it has 100% succeeded 

TL;DR - removal of siphon had the intended effect of making pubs more casual, and that has been a good thing for the game.",FortNiteBR

Whooohooo i was all exited and jumped on. The i started reading how the system works... then i was disapointed again :D. Epic does not fail to underperform! They created gold and still find a way to disapoint every time.   


The ranked system is nothing more than time spend + some extra if you accually do something like kill someone. In a very late stage of the ladder you can accualy lose some bus fee. But that is nearly enought to stop your progression, next to that you cannot demote.   


  
\----------------------------------  


I think i know why epic does not want a real ranked system because it could lose them players. Demoted players get demotivated. And demotivated players quit. Take a look at this video, @3:39 3 ways to keep players in your game as long as possible:  


1. liniar prograssion  
2. let players play 1 more turn  
3. **Make them feel above average**  


Watch the whole vid its interesting. 

&amp;#x200B;

So my conclusion would be: It's not interesting to make a real ranked game because that does not bring in the optimal amound of cash. A system that keeps players in the game as long as possible is more profitable. 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand epic is just business and i do understand why they are deciding to do things like this. Unfortunately i am one of the few games that really dislike this. The majority of the player base is enjoying this and there is nothing wrong with that.   

&amp;#x200B;

So what do you guys think, am i right, am a wrong, why am i right or wrong.

New POIs, new biomes, new terrain, the lot. I'd like to see absolutely everything change. I hope the Volcano erupts and burns everything to the ground, giving us something brand new in the coming seasons. I say coming seasons instead of Season 9 because having a brand new map in Season 9 would be incredibly unfair to those with established landing spots for the World Cup.

I'm not an arsonist, but if there were flamethrowers in Fortnite BR, I'd start burning the living shit out of everything.

I expected this and its nice to see a lot of the new changes. The playerbase is also improved ten fold and im lagging a bit behind so I get out played quite often whereas I used to be able to consistently play top 10. All these are expected and normal and I don't mind it one bit.  


However, there is one thing that sticks out sorely from my experience. There is way too much mobility now, at almost no risk in some cases. People can fly from place to place and land on people upon people as they please. During my break i did play one or two games in between to know that health per kill was added and taken away again. Please add it back. There is absolutely no way you can get off a heal in time for the next fight as people will bounce onto you and make you kiss the lobby before you can reach the medkit/shield slot in your inventory. This is because there are way too many methods to move around, from hover boards, to bouncing glass balls, to ziplines, to gliders that magically appear from your spine, to impulse grenades among other things.  


So in conclusion, from a season 1 veteran that has become a little rusty, I feel like while the game is still fun, mobility is a bit too easy for my liking and makes the pace of the game much too fast to allow for things other than constant fighting, which if you're not playing the game competitively continuously there's no chance you can survive at all. This could be helped by adding health per kill back, as trying to remove all the mobility at once is unrealistic.",FortNiteBR

Making around $800k a year is a dream job if you are a normal developer and not a celebrity or a famous athlet. It's up to them to choose between their families and the job. People in my country work around 80 hours per week and their job is way more exhausting/hard and yet receive around $400 per month ( ~$4800 a year) which is around 20 times less than the fortnite devs' salaries. It's also their fault that they let the managers treat them like this. And no, I'm not sarcastic.",FortNiteBR

As you can read in the article they get boni up to THREE times their salary. Sure thing it is a crushing mental pressure but it‚Äôs a choice to work there and if you want a lot of money, you have to work a lot, like in every other profession.
Just keep this in mind while reading the article/posts/comments. Everyone likes to put themselves into the victim role, but you have to look at the whole story.",FortNiteBR

The frustration of getting killed by the sword outweighed the satisfaction of playing the game. Since the sword got vaulted, I have returned sweatier than ever. After playing 10 or so games, every time I survived my initial drop, I would die the exact same way every time. I would hunt people down as I do, get into a build battle or something of the sort, get third partied, kill initial prey, focus on immediate threat (third partier) but take some damage, then get kamikazed by a plane with no repercussions because if I take shots at the plane, I will be shotgunned and killed. No matter what I do, my chances of survival are slim to none because I’m just going to get kamikaze’d until death, lose the shotgun battle, or I win the shotgun battle and blow up the plane but now the pilot is gliding onto me with 175 health. With all this being said, I’m back to taking a break from fortnite similar to when the sword was out. 

I don’t see why epic hasn’t balanced planes yet. Nobody thinks they are a good addition to the game the way they are. WHAT ARE THEY WAITING FOR? Can anyone give me a valid reason as what is taking so long for them to nerf  planes? ",FortniteCompetitive

This is due to the lack of burst damage as a shotgun, inconsistency and lack of range. It quite a shame as the tac shotgun has always had a place in the meta since up until season 5.

My suggestion is to remove the swap delay in the tac shotgun. After several games of using the tac shotgun, I can strongly argue that the tac has the same effectiveness as an smg. Therefore pump tac should be the same and pump smg, making the gun balanced. It is the same as switching to an ar after a snipe or smg after a pump. In addition the user would lose structure damage effectiveness as a trade off.

Video Link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtXNRDjZsoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtXNRDjZsoM)

My Twitch: twitch.tv/kleinFN

The video only contains Atlantis Khuna's POV, as Mitr0 wasn't streaming these 1v1s, so I only have notes on Khuna's playstyle. While some of the tips and ideas from this video may be familiar to many of you, I thought it would help to observe what the pros do in built battles that give them little advantages and increase their likelihoods of winning.

Notes:

\- Watch for structures help by only one ramp, as they are the ones to target when wanting to knock down.

\- Constantly find ways to shoot your enemy, rather than only attempting to build. This is particularly noticeable in the first build battle, when Khuna edits on Mitr0, who attempted to go to the side and go for highground, and instead of doing the same, which I would have likely done, Khuna pulls off the edit and hits a 187 dmg shot on Mitr0.

\- Utilize the power of editing. This is something I've noticed among many of the top players, that they are constantly editing through structures and finding angles on their opponents rather than continuing to build. Khuna pulls this off multiple times, either through editing ramps and floors, often getting an angle on Mitr0 or a more advantageous position.

\- Stay close to your opponent. Khuna constantly stays close to Mitr0, and this allows him to get off shots from angles he wouldn't have had if he built too high above Mitr0. He is constantly tracking Mitr0 and following him, which helps both in getting off shots, and in preventing Mitr0 from doing the same. Mitr0 repeats this strategy in a later fight and this allows him to get off shots in the split seconds before Khuna covers himself, and eventually wins the fight.

\- Maintain your playstyle. In the second 1v1, Mitr0 maintains his regular playstyle after Khuna hits him with a high damage shot, rather than playing more defensively or aggressively than usual. His personal playstyle is what he is best at and this enables him to get Khuna low, although Khuna eventually wins the fight.

\- Maintain crosshair placement. Khuna constantly keeps his crosshair at the height that Mitr0's height is supposed to be. This allows him to get off good shots when Mitr0 is attempting to edit on him, as well as when flicking, as his crosshair is already placed at head level, and needs to move less.

I don't know if this common knowledge, but I've been playing since season 1 and I've only just discovered this. I recently realised while testing in playgrounds that traps place on release rather than press. All other building blocks place on press rather than release, so tbh I see no reason why it should be different for traps. After countless situations where I would swear I tried to place a trap but no trap placed, this made me understand why this was happening. To me this is an annoying flaw in the game as it makes placing traps slower. This is especially true for someone like me who has an older mouse so clicking isn't as quick. I think providing an option for the player to place their traps on press rather than release is the best way to solve this issue.

[Here is a demonstration of how traps are place on mouse release compared to builds being placed instantly.](https://gfycat.com/TidyEcstaticFirebelliedtoad)

[This clip also helps to demonstrate.](https://gfycat.com/YoungBitesizedLcont)

[This is the problem I'm having.](https://gfycat.com/OrneryRigidHamster) If I move too fast then my traps will not place as by the time my mouse button has released I am no longer focusing on that specific wall. Obviously now I know to release my mouse button first before looking at the next piece but my point still stands that this only slows the player down.",FortniteCompetitive

I literally, and I mean that in the actual sense if the word, cannot go ONE game without some game breaking instance or ridiculous rng.

Just made it top 10 and fell of a zipline, just because the game decided I wasn't going to win that round.

Still love the game but theres actually no point in even playing right now because I know every game something will happen to completely mess me over. 

Without fail my builds wont edit repeately causing me to die.

The amount low skill items/items in this game now is INSANE.

I dont care what anybody says TRAPS are way to fucking OP. Its not even a question. The only reason people like them is because they enjoy the mechanic, or find trap kills satisfying. It is not balanced at all.

Theres no way you should be able to just spam click place for 150 damage in a 1x1 area. If you react fast enough and move out of the way, they can just place annother one. Then if you kill them, their trap goes off after they die!

Spray RNG is just a clever excuse to give noobs an advantage, which nobody on this sub seems to realize. 

Game will constantly keep me in a loop of switching between build and weapons because of the massive input delay.

Am constantly staring at an empry space trying to place a build for seconds with no response. The build finally places AFTER my opponent gets the shot. This seems to happen without fail.

Get behind cover and get shot still because of the massive discrepancy between what I see on my screen and the server appearantly.

I could go on and on. I just wish they would balance this game out but I dont think is going to happen now. 

Went from 50+ to maybe 10 wins in solos from season five to season six and this season isny looking much better. How is that even possible?

So sick of it at this point Im hoping for either a good fortnite clone that is more like the earlier seasons, or the next good game.

So what this mean for you and this partially aimed more at console players.
 So first things first let's start with visuals, now I know alot of people play on TV's which on average will have 30-40 or greater input delay depending on how old your TV, now that's pretty large when you compare it to monitors which now adays are regularly under a 10ms delay. So for console players, since the max you can run at is 60hz the min delay you can get is 16ms so a cheap monitor will work just fine, even so, this small bit can help in situations. Along with this, insure that what ever visuals you have are on the smaller side, our vision can only take in so much at a time so maybe rethink that 55"" 4k tv you bought to play fortnite on. 
Now secondly let's talk about sound which oddly can be much more important. Now I know this community likes to hate on the sounds in this game and I'll agree that vertical sound definitely needs some work but more times than not, good audio has allowed me to pinpoint where enemies are even in build fights that look more like mazes. Now I'm not ragging on you for using that 60 pair of TB's you got at Walmart. 
So at the end if the day before you make a post about how you want to improve, ask yourself wether it's a actual lack of skill that's holding you back or your peripherals.",FortniteCompetitive

Popular streamers started using the silenced scar over the regular scar, and many people started using it over the regular scar and I was confused by this. How in the world is the silenced scar better than the regular scar? Well heres my breakdown. (Also, I will be comparing the gold version of both the scars)

Spraying: 

The scar clearly wins when it comes to spraying. Not only does it deal 3 more damage, but it also has less bloom than the silenced scar when spraying for more than 5 bullets. I think the scar wins, but then again spraying is not the strong side of the silenced scar. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tapfiring:

Almost everyone says that the strength of the silenced scar is the fast FSA reset which makes it better for tapfiring. And at first I thought that this was a pretty good argument, but then I looked it up and realised that the FSA reset on the silenced scar is 16 frames (If played on 60fps) and the regular scar has a FSA reset of 17 frames. This means that you would have to shoot and hit 16 times (at the exact frame that it resets the FSA) with the silenced scar, for it to be ""better"" than the scar at tapfiring. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also tapfiring with the silenced scar is useless because of the AK, but that's beside the point.",FortniteCompetitive

However, the fact of the matter is that I have less than a 1 kd and have not been able to maintain better even when I have tried.

I have played fortnite consistently without significant breaks for 11 months since season 2. In August I finally committed to switching to PC and keyboard and mouse (although I had tried multiple times before and failed, and also played unreal tournament for 2 months to get better at kb/m movement and aim), after never doing very well on console, bar one freak 20 bomb I got in solo squads late season 4.

Despite this, I have played around 6000 total games (and don't even get me started on how many I've watched from good players), I have only \~25 wins, and I have only got more than 7 kills in a game 3 times.

Obviously, I have taken many suggestions as to how to improve. I try to play extremely aggressively quite often, although I really don't have the ability to do so. I probably spend about 30 minutes a day aim training and practising my building mechanics. I record many of my deaths and rewatch them to see how I could have played them better. I build battle a lot in playground. And I definitely, definitely spend enough time watching and analysing better players than me.

I'm not expecting to be winning skirmishes or even be a particularly competitive player, but I would like to be able to at least get a few kills in pubs semi-regularly, or get more than 3 points in 2 hours of pop up cup despite not actually feeling like I am playing particularly poorly.

There aren't many reasons why I shouldn't be decent at the game. All my peripherals are good, except maybe a 60hz monitor, my keybinds are very good, and my sens (800dpi 0.08) is perfectly reasonable.

So not for the first time, I will ask, how can I actually improve?",FortniteCompetitive

The biggest thing I could point to for evidence is that I see almost no one take a purple or even gold heavy over a purple pump. Not my friends, not streamers, the pump is just... better. 

The heavy would be far from OP if they just nudged it so that it could potentially one shot. Give it 80 bodyshot, make it reward precision with the better HS multiplier, and maybe people will pick it up again. ",FortniteCompetitive

Most the suggestions are to add a punishment for kamikaze attacks, but that not as huge an issue in competitive as it is pubs. Yes it’s still a problem, but the bigger issue is obviously how pros just fly around calling truces with one another in end game.

So I raise the question: what do you all believe to be the solution to this? Personally I think if they made it easier for planes to shoot out other planes and make it more rewarding (Popo already confirmed 50 damage if the plane blows up when you’re in it) then it would incentivize dog fights. Another solution could be to get rid of drop-off damage with ARs and pistols. This would make them easier to shoot down and perhaps encourage players to the silenced scar and pistol.

I’m interested to hear others opinions though, but I’d like the discussion to be centered towards countering the issue of end game planes rather than kamikaze planes.",FortniteCompetitive

We have decided to host our own leaderboard where everyone here can compete against each other to see who can score the highest amount of points within the tournament. This will work by users submitting scores online through a link that we provide and the scores will be placed in order and then posted following the end of the in game tournament. This is first time we are trying this and if it successful we will continue to create these leaderboards for future in game tournaments.

**How to Submit:** 

Visit the link provided above or [here](https://goo.gl/forms/kKnyjYFskm2HT5VU2), select the region you participated in, and when it comes to the in-game screenshots you will be able to link 2 screenshots/pictures of your results from the tournament. **The most important one to link and remember to take, is a screenshot of the end of your final game showing your username and amount of points.** Example: https://i.imgur.com/BPfRvhs.jpg - The other screenshot/picture you need is of the final results showed in the events tab. Example: https://i.imgur.com/iKb8elU.jpg note: it is okay for these two pictures to be taken from a phone/camera if screenshotting is not available as long as you can see the necessary information in them. 

**Incentives:** 
The top 10 players from each region (NA, EU, OCE, ASIA, BR) will have their scores displayed within the results post with links to their socials. We will also be testing out how this works in order for us to be able to grant text flairs for users to show case their pins on next to their Reddit usernames! (all other scores will be available in the full leaderboard)

2. Increase the damage received when the plane explodes to 75 or 100. People can avoid this anyway by just jumping.
3. Add a fuel mechanic to airplanes to prevent people playing passive with them and just camping on the edges (especially for competitive play)

This is of course excellent news. However, no one, under **any circumstances** should be praising Epic for this. Understand how to separate the action from the entity responsible for it. What I mean is that this is not good, ingenious thinking from them. This is literally what anybody with a brain would have done. **They deserve 0 credit.**

This community keeps going through a cycle like a new owner training a puppy. When Epic poops on the carpet, we say ""Bad dog!"" and then praise them when they poop in their box or whatever (I've never had a pet dog, so I don't actually know where they're supposed to poop, but that's beside the point...). Except the issue is these aren't fucking puppies. They're fully grown morons that have stumbled onto a goldmine, and were very attentive to the cultural zeitgeist this game produced back in season 3. That's it. So stop praising them for everything.

One thing that consistently amazes me about this game is how much of a ""beautiful accident"" it was, so to speak. The idea that a building mechanic in a battle royale would mesh well didn't really occur to anybody, and even Epic really had no idea the capabilities of it until forerunners like Myth showed what was possible.

I understand this game and community is quite young, but I'd like them to take example from other older, more ""toxic"" communities like LoL. Those players will not say nice things about Riot ever, because of the trauma they've endured from being scorn so many times. They either shittalk or say nothing. That is what needs to develop here ASAP.

Basically what I'm trying to say is, cut the positive reinforcement cycle that leaves you looking like a gullible, battered fool 2 weeks later. Epic is not a pet that responds well to ""Whose a good boy!"". And they are not a special company when they made BR - the community who imbued it with metas and meaning are. They don't exactly have a great track record with keeping games alive (*cough* Paragon *cough*).

It took complaining and protesting and talking down to the naysayers who actually enjoy broken multiplayer gameplay to get to this point.

The Mythic Blade has been removed because it was implemented beyond poorly for a BR game. 

The Mounted Turret was significantly nerfed so it can be countered rather simply in most 1v1 cases. 

The Planes quite obviously gave too much reward and not enough risk when used, so explosive damage was added when breaking the plane.

The in-game tournament system had queue times that were unacceptably long. After complaining vehemently during those tournaments, Epic managed to patch in a change that allowed solo tournament players to find matches in in less than 5mins, even after gaining many points.

I understand their basic ideas when releasing content like the Mythic Blade or Turrets or Planes. New content = new/refreshed players = potential streams of revenue. But banking on increasing revenue with new content all the time is a fallacy if you aren't testing it properly before public release.

That said, the main thing that has been grinding my gears about this game and this company for the last months or so has been Epic's lack of (professional) communication.

I come from a marketing background in which ambassador related community management plays a large role, and it's absolutely mind blowing to me that a company with a competitive advantage and opportunity as big as Epic right now is doing everything in their power to not capitalize on it. In fact, they are somehow managing to turn this around and have it hurt them. I cannot overstate the sheer stupidity of what they are doing. 

It started with glider redeploy, in which they stated that it would be available for one week. As we all know, they extended it, because, as per a single Epic paragraph on their website and Reddit:

&gt;We are seeing positive changes due to the implementation of glider redeploy.

This is so incredibly disrespectful to your player base. First you bait and switch, and then you cannot even have the common decency of explaining what those 'positive changes' indeed are.

So many posts on this sub and on r/FortNiteBR can simply be solved by some clear communication from Epic's side.

Right now there is a post on the front page about a comment made by an Epic employee in a Reddit thread. Isn't that ridiculous by itself?

Additionally, for the more marketing aware, their SEO strategy is also a disaster.

If you google 'Fortnite Winter Royale Epic', like the most obvious combinations of keywords available, their own site ranks **6th**, in GERMAN and FRENCH. Over the English one!!

They can't even properly market and communicate on their own channels. 

Not to mention their 'frontmen', which are the casters and commentators on their events and a homeless cocaine degenerate. The casters and commentators can't ever be objective, because there would presumably be repercussions.

There are so many game companies right now that have set a 'best practice' when it comes down to communication and community management

Through Twitch and the comp scene your ambassador and marketing structure is basically served to Epic on a silver platter already, yet they cannot be fucking arsed to establish even ONE continuous line of feedback and communication with their core userbase. 

So many threads here discuss 'What if Epic..', 'Will Epic do..', etc. And so many answers range from 'I think Epic will..'. 

Nobody knows their intentions. These threads are all literally throwing some shit out there because we can't possibly tell what they are thinking.

I see people throw around numbers of people that ventured to LTMs and don't play solos anymore. This data is not public, so you literally bullshitting. 

We have no insight in these things. And we need it. Epic needs it.

This has turned into way too much of an unstructured rant and I'm sorry, but it's just awful.

The bad news is that epic recently announced that we will be seeing more of these 'mythic' weapons placed around the map. I'm here to tell you- that next weapon will more than likely be throwing stars. 

Epic uses the battlepass sprays and banners to foreshadow the next season, or upcoming features. (Alot of the stuff is underwater themed- the ice biome will probably melt, but that's a separate story.) The tier 42 banner is the Blade. There is also a banner of what is more than likely the next mythic weapon, a throwing star.

Yes I agree that the sword should not have been added into the main game. Yes I agree it is extremely over-powered in its current state. Yes I agree that the sword is making the game not fun at the moment.

This community has become VERY TOXIC in the past week, and I mean more toxic than ever. I almost feel bad for Epic having to deal with us. 

Something most players do not know about this sword is that it is from another on of Epic’s games. Although it is a mobile game, it is a game they are proud of. I like the idea of letting Epic celebrating their own game by adding something from it into their most popular game. The constant urge to REMOVE this sword from the game completely kind of seems like a slap in the face to Epic.

This sword should NOT be removed.

Firstly,
    This sword (IN MY OPINION) is a cool concept on paper. Having strong and unique tools around the map that people fight for sounds like a fun addition to the map. The problem is that doing this, especially when they are powerful, causes people to be lead away from other places on the map. This also leads to less people surviving for longer than the first circle. I feel if this sword is to be nerfed a bit, as they are planning to remove building from its capabilities, this could actually be a cool and unique way to play the game along with the standard shooter we have been playing for over a year.

Second,
    If this sword IS going to stay in the game, along with nerfs, we will get used to it. I do not agree with the way the sword was implemented (directly into the main game with little to no info on how it would work). This is similar to “Glider Redeploy” after FortNitemares. This feature changed up the game and definitely changed the pace. We felt that it was too big of a change at one time. If glider redeploy and the sword had been announced and discussed before release, or even an LTM for the sword, we would have been way more accepting of the sword.

Lastly,
    Epic has gone through SO MUCH recently. I can’t imagine being them. Having to deal with constant back-lash, and constantly being told that the game is dying or becoming stale, I wouldn’t be able to handle it. This sword was to add variety and a different way to play this game. I feel if we were way less aggressive about every single change ever made to this amazing game, Epic wouldn’t have to be scared with every change they make and could more fluently test additions for the game.

TL:DR 
The constant back-lash, even if it may be deserved, is not healthy for the community. The way the sword was implemented should have been different, but the sword should definitely not be removed.

Please discuss in the comments, I really want to hear opinions on this post!

186,randomnicer,1544785906,a63xgg,66,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a63xgg/casuals_are_not_playing_the_normal_modes_so_epic/,1,casuals are not playing the normal modes so epic makes the normal modes more like a ltm,"A lot of casual players do not play solos, some play duos and squads but not a lot.

they moved to the limited time modes and playground. 

The reason that they move away is relative easy, they cant win games anymore and even a kill gets harder and harder. this started around season 4-5 and it went downhill from there.

Epic clearly doesn't like that, they see it as a problem that normal players do not play the normal game mode. So they start changing this mode to attract more players. 

But with every chance they make the experience demolished. Because it's not the game that makes casuals move away from normals, it's the player base. 

if u take a 100 players. around 13 players are going to be the absolute worst, around 63 are going to be averige, 12 are decent and 1 is significant better than the rest. The 13 top players will have multipe kills each game and are most of the reason that the midgame is so dead and one of them will motslikely win. So 76 player will not see the midgame or will die lategame to a player thats a lot better than them. This makes the game a lot less fun and the reason they move away. 

&amp;#x200B;

The trick is to get the above average players out of the normal game modes, or atleast get the top 13 players out. This will make the game a better experience for the rest of the playerbase.

&amp;#x200B;

there are 2 obvious ways to do this.

&amp;#x200B;

1: add strong toys or game changing mechanics that are fun to use for average players. drum gun, turret, deploy, a shit ton of strong weapons and rifts(zombies), double barrel, planes, swords. And even a secret nerf to shields after the shotgun buff so nobody has them and u only need a luckybodyshot to take out a player. 

&amp;#x200B;

the problem with this is that even tho the good players dont like the chances, they will use it. i don't like the redeploy but i abused it to the max, i don't like the turret. but as a squat we laugh when we put 8 of these down on a mountain and sprayed down everything. And in this season we kill the sword guy, take it with a plain and have the swort guy dive bomb every fight while we minigun, dynamite, rocket launch the whole thing from up top. We kill 30 players average and win 80% while abusing the meta. Is it fun in the long run? no. but its better than dying to it. Look at te pro's, nobody likes the sword. But in the winter royal nobody leaves it on the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

2: Add a ranked mode without the toys. The competitive players love the game, not the toys. They want a balanced game that rewards skill, game sense, building and grinding. They play to compete and will move to ranked if they could. There is already a good environment in place with the popups(if they remove the planes and short u are almost there) So add a good ssbm system and make it 24/7. It will remove a lot of players from the normal modes. Which gives the casual players a break.

I keep saying things will get better and was seeing that take place towards the end of season 6. Yes, there were still things I'd have liked Epic to change but I enjoyed playing the game and they have also made some really good changes and additions to it, which I am grateful for. However, it's gotten to the point where I only continue to play because I've invested so much time and money into it. There is no drive to want to improve or to just play to have a good time. I am addicted to the competitive side of games and watching the shenanigans in the NA Winter Royale take place was humorous yet really alarming and was a real slap in the face to those who made sacrifices to attempt to compete. 

I think as a community, we want to know why Epic are making the decisions they currently are. The transparency between the company and the community is slowly being lost and with that, so is our support. Another State of Development post would be a step in the right direction.

Fortnite has been my escape from the real World, and being physically unable to go out much due to my circumstances, instead of losing my mind over my current situation, I decided to dedicate myself somewhat to this game. I started playing around November last year, and sadly have the Crackshot (honestly it's trash don't buy it).

I've managed to play 10,400 games and have over 1500 wins, so essentially Fortnite has been my life for the past year. I consider myself for a console player pretty good and believe it or not I used standard controls up until a few months ago, it wasn't until I quit completely and my brain unwired itself from smashing Triangle was I able to come back and learn Builder Pro.

When Season 7 started the game felt very good, and I instantly bought the Premium Pass, the planes were not too bothering since Battlefield is where I've come from, and that's a franchise I've quit completely due to the massive amounts of changes they have made with zero regard to the community completely to the point of insulting and laughing at the userbase.

And this is where my experience I think might come in helpful, because not only did EA ruin the Battlefield franchise, (they also had a game years ago called Battlefield Heroes that's scary similar to the current state of Fortnite, just YT ""Battlefield Heroes Planes""), but it's pretty obvious to me that Epic are slowly going down a nasty path the same way EA did and it upsets me, so this is why I feel for those who are being vocal, and rightly so.

Do I think being vocal will do much? No, especially not from us, EA ignored and insulted the entire community, they have no remorse on what they've done to the franchise, pre-release they did a big community drive, released many videos on what they were working towards after the massive negativity that surrounded the game and sadly many bought into it. I honestly think the only way Epic will potentially listen is through streamers getting together and essentially agreeing to stop streaming Fortnite, the difference between Fortnite and Battlefield is that Streamers have a small but real influence on the game.

We can also stop purchasing vBucks, but realistically it will do nothing.

But, will streamers do anything? I honestly think that the top level streamers would prefer to keep their relationship with Epic decent, a tweet here or there won't damage relations, but a boycott would make any Streamer effectively blacklisted, FIFA had a Pro blacklisted because he spoke out about the current state of FIFA 19, don't think it couldn't happen with Fortnite.

Lets all be patient and see what the update brings, Fortnitemares and Redeploy killed my love for the game to a point, and the Sword has stopped me playing the last few days, lets just hope that they bring it upon themselves to do what's right, because after all, they have created in my opinion one of the best games ever made, so they have the minds and the capabilities to get together and do what's best not only for us, but for them too.

Sorry for the long post!

**The presence of Mythic items in gameplay is to provide an interaction a step above the Legendary item functionality and something you’ll continue to see. ""**

&amp;#x200B;

Are you kidding me?  You have a continued history of not being able to properly balance new items. I really hope by future and continue you really mean LTM because if you do not you literally might be digging your grave beginning with this sword.  I am about to say something that has been said many times over the past year . . . this is by far the least enjoyable this game has ever been to me.  Its funny though because its actually accurate every time its said.  Every single time Epic has made a huge change that the majority of players do not like.  Instead of learning from their mistakes they really seem to be doubling down on it.  Its almost as if they are the stubborn friend who refuses to change something that doesnt work.

Epic, it is not fun to play a game with \~20 people left at end of first circle because a majority have died by or trying to get your mythical item you just added. Its also not fun to literally hide from the sword when you see someone holding it.  Its not fun to pump someone multiple times in the face and still die to them bc they can just warp towards you and swing a sword.  This mechanic, believe it or not, is not fun for the majority of players both competitive and casual.

I really hope you realize how stubborn that sentence above is.  I really hope you realize that these items need to be confined to LTMs and not the core game.  This backlash by both the casual and comp community should be very clear to you that if these overpowered mythical items continue to make it into the core game people will stop playing.  Instead of instant joining a new match as i usually do i am here, venting, pleading, hoping you realize if you continue to be as stubborn as that sentence makes you out to be people will begin to leave.  Again, the mechanic is not fun.

I wont even begin to discuss how unbalanced planes are bc they seem like a walk in the park compared to these mythical items you say you will continue to release.  Please explain to me how these mythical items even belong in this world?  I remember what the map looked like in season 1 and 2.  I remember the game play and the skins.  Please tell me exactly how these mythical items must fit in. 

Please Epic, stop now, grow up and stop being stubborn.

The game was becoming a bit bland to me, so I decided to try out CS:GO since it recently went free to play, and it has entirely changed the way I view Fortnite’s potential as an esport. I used to think that competitive players were overreacting to the RNG involved in tournaments but after playing CS, my outlandish hopes for a truly competitive Fortnite have almost disappeared.

     For those that don’t know, CS:GO has extremely complicated shooting mechanics that take years to fully master, let alone complex strategies, teamwork and map awareness. There are different recoil patterns for every weapon along with interesting physics involving motion and accuracy (don’t fully understand them yet) which completely eliminates any notion of, “spray and pray” whatsoever. I’ve been getting absolutely destroyed in my first couple comp matches, but the improvement I’ve seen in myself is so refreshing and I’m brought back to the same feeling I got in Fortnite many months ago. Hopping on to a game where I know the steps I need to take to improve and just straight up grinding once again is such a good feeling, and it’s why I enjoy video games so much. It’s what Fortnite is missing right now.

     I’ve seen many people in this sub talking about how custom game modes and maps created in creative mode could save Fortnite as an esport, but I simply do not see how that is possible with the current shooting system. Yes, building is a skill gap, but in what ways could this be implemented in a non battle royale setting effectively, where you don’t occasionally have to use a rely on a completely RNG based mechanic (bloom) at all. The answer is never. 

     Although the building in Fortnite is definitely an insanely enjoyable experience that kept me thoroughly invested for over a year, RNG based shooter mechanics in a SHOOTER will hold this game back from its full potential in the competitive scene till the end of time, and it’s a damn shame.",FortniteCompetitive

Recently, with the occurrence of in game tournaments we have seen a lot of posts asking if there's an online leaderboard for said tournaments, and the unfortunate answer to that is no. So, we have decided to host our own leaderboard where everyone here can compete against each other to see who can score the highest amount of points within the tournament. This will work by users submitting scores online through a link that we provide and the scores will be placed in order and then posted following the end of the in game tournament. This is first time we are trying this and if it successful we will continue to create these leaderboards for future in game tournaments.

---

### About

**When:** 
This first leaderboard will be made for the Solo Explorer Pop-up Cup on Friday, December 14, 2018. Only points scored during this days time frames will be counted.

**How it works:** 
On the day of the selected in game tournament we will pin a post on the sub that has a link for you to submit your score, a screenshot of the score, region, IGN, reddit username, (and socials if applicable). After that, we will sort all of the scores and put them into the leaderboard (sorted by score and separated by region) and post it the day after the competition ends.

**Incentives:** 
The top 10 players from each region (NA, EU OCE, ASIA, BR) will have their scores displayed within the results post with links to their socials. (all other scores will be available in the full leaderboard)

I have been coaching and doing open vod reviews for the last couple of months. Jtrain and I made a [10 Step guide to winning the Winter Royale using the Infinity Blade!](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a58b12/10_steps_to_winning_winter_royale_using_the/?st=JPKB8W90&amp;sh=f14ecd37), Tuesday, the morning of patch 7.0.1 with the heats beginning in a couple of hours. We also sent Chap a more detailed version of this before the heats started. Chap qualified after the very first game but it didn’t work out exactly how we planned. This made me want to wake up at 3 am the morning of the finals to work on this guide to help give him the best chance of winning when playing around the Infinity Blade. I hope you guys enjoy and any feedback is appreciated. It was an absolute pleasure working with Chap. (Code: Chap in the item shop)

Comment if you would like to hear my reasoning and let me know what you think. I want to know why you agree or disagree!","Vault: 
SWORD 
Planes - see nerf list. 
Rifts, don’t mind if they stay however. 
Turret
Grappler 
Rift-to-go 
Quadcrusher 
Grey Tac 
Quad Launcher
Heavy Sniper
Burst AR
Dynamite 

Put in:
Glider redeploy
70/50/30 mats for a kill
50 health/shield for a kill, maybe gain 5 shield a second for 10 seconds. 
Impulse grenades again, were balanced imo, requires a certain amount of skill and would be good, but not overpowered late game like a grappler is. 

Nerf:
Max rockets 8 or 10
Rocket Launcher dmg- rare 90 legendary 95
GL - 75/80/85 if blue ones still exits 
Traps- 100 dmg
Deagle can’t one shot mats
Heavy AR should probs do 38/39/40 body 
and 76/78/80 head 

Mat Limit - atm the map has an imbalance of mats which makes NE of the map so good for metal because of crates, underground wailing and risky, brick because of the bit near tomato/wailing and obviously wood. If it was 750/750/750 more people could get max and less people would have a 400 mat advantage. I like the way it works in the pop-up cups at the moment so that way might work the best. 


Planes could be nerfed if when it was destroyed it dealt more damage? 50? Because anyone would take 25dmg on a rotation any day. I also think there should be a fuel tank or something which allowed for 2 minutes (I don’t know if this is too long) of air time, enough to rotate but stops people having a free pass to late game. There also needs to be a punishment for planes hitting into builds and getting an elim for free. The plane should blow up or the player should take damage similar to when landing a quad crusher. The fact it has a turret on and in squads, 4 people can sit on wings, in the sky and shoot just makes them ridiculous when used by skilled players. 

Buff: 
Launch pad launch height cos bit crap if glider redeploy is in 
Chug Jug use whilst moving or gives 100/100 but like a slurp cos it’s not really legendary as it is now. 
Farming gives 40% more mats

234,Okuser,1544722585,a5vnmt,31,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a5vnmt/the_ping_related_turbobuilding_inconsistency/,1,"The ping related turbo-building ""inconsistency"" needs more visibility, because it is meta-shifting (in an unacceptable way) for central USA players.","Players with less than 30 ping can stand behind a wall and hold left click, and nothing will be able to get through their wall no matter what. 

My ping, during early game, hovers around 60. And if I try to stand behind a wall and hold left click to stop someone that's holding W and left click with an SMG. Not only do bullets get through in-between each wall replacement, but they can literally get their bodies through the wall INTO my 1x1.

I shouldn't need to explain the consequences of this. But basically it means that I'm ARBITRARILY  taking more damage, using more mats, and being put into worse positions ALL the time. 

When I'm turtling in a 1x1 and someone is going for wall replacements on my box, I have no control over whether they will get the replacement, because sometimes their lower ping just randomly beats out my turbo-building ""advantage"" that I should have for replacing my own walls. And when someone gets a wall replace on my 1x1, I'm forced to edit out the back and spent 80 mats on a new 1x1. but sometimes there will be something blocking me from behind and thats not an option, so i just get fucked since I can't sit in a 1x1 by like all other low-ping, high level players. And then the process just repeats itself and i'm constantly losing absurd amounts of mats and positioning compared to a low ping player. 

inb4 ""use 2 layers of protection with roof+cone or wall+ramp"" no shit, because that's literally the only way I can play the game at the moment is by doing this. But because of circumstances you can't always have 2 layers, sometimes you are forced into a situation where you only have 1 layer of protection against spam, and when this happens I just arbitrarily take damage from AR spam or SMG spam when other players with low ping don't. Also, the fact that I'm constantly having to use 2 layers to protect from spray spam means i'm literally using twice as much mats as a low ping player, for no reason.

I got 27 points in the Open Winter Qualifier and I was constantly feeling the effects of my disadvantage. It's entirely possible that I would've ended up with 2 more points if I wasn't forced to play an ENTIRELY different meta-game from other players. ",FortniteCompetitive

I have spent most of thise first days in Creative and Team Rumble and while my aim was getting better, something felt off, it was not feeling smooth. I just tried 800dpi with 0.6 ingame sensitivity and noticed huge difference in smoothness aleardy in Creative mode while building. Went to solos, i played couple before with 400dpi and lost because of shitty aim, but with 800dpi it was completely different. I landed Tilted and absolutely hit everything, it wasn't placebo.

It may not seem like much but I have been so much more able to carry my own now and yesterday I finally carried my teammate. It was kind of spoiled because we got killed by the sword but I got 5 kills which is rare for me and I felt more confident  that my gameplay than I have yet.

I was entertained by the sword play and the planes. I thought it was interesting to watch players adapt to the huge change. It was nice (for me) to get a change from what I’m used to. I also think fun/stupid changes like this are what keeps the game so popular/allows players the opportunity to make so much money off of it. I do wish they had released the sword earlier so that the players had had more time to practice with it. I know this is an unpopular opinion and I understand why but moments like these are moments that keep me hooked in watching the game instead of moving on to other games.

The mix of an FPS style game with the micro mechanics of building and editing creates such a beautiful platform for competitive play. Over the past few months, we practiced building, editing,  aiming, played scrims and devoted part of our lives to the sport of playing competitively. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been engaged in balancing and perfecting the comp scene. I was always hopeful the ""Esports Ready"" patch was right around the corner. Unfortunately, I now realise my naivety. I guess Riot Games (LoL) spoiled it's players and my expectations are too high.

&amp;#x200B;

The NA Winter Royale was a joke. It has this huge game that could skyrocket E-sports to new heights, but instead they use it as a platform to advertise new in-game features. None of the players who qualified got a decent chance to prove themselves. Fulmer (Rank 1) didn't even make finals after dominating in qualifiers. Supporting pros is heartbreaking. I might aswell be watching them play bingo, as skill is slowly becoming irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

It's obvious the competitive scene should have a ranked mode. A bare-bones version of the game. No planes. No sword. Less RNG. Less bullshit. But I'm tired of waiting for this to happen and finally no longer have the addictive urge to play Fornite. So I hope Epic listens to it's core fan-base and not just their sales department. They've lost at least one player today.

**I want to shoot a plane as a plane.**

&amp;#x200B;

What can shooting a plane accomplish? 

* Blows up the enemy plane
* Makes the enemy drop to the ground
* Does a little bit of damage

All great things, so why don't I shoot a plane?

I don't shoot a plane because If I shoot a plane and I knock out 1 person from the air, all that'll happen is that there's just one more guy on the ground that realizes how OP planes are and will probably shoot all the rest of the planes because he's pissed his toy broke.

Including me, and **I REALLY don't want my toy to break**.

&amp;#x200B;

The guy can also go highjack my plane if he's higher than me, although this is unlikely.

Think about it. If there's 5 other pilots, **why not just not shoot each other and all just take the free ride to top 10?**  I don't know about you guys, but I sure as hell would NOT want to be on the ground with a wannabe Genji main running around with tons of dynamite and edit bugs and on east servers if I'm west.

I played one, died to sword in top 2, then closed out the game. Is Epic trying to kill their game intentionally? Are they sick of making so much money? I honestly just don’t understand. No, I’m not saying this is Paragon. No, I’m not saying this game is dying. What I’m saying, is that this game is not going down a good path, and you’d be a fool to say that “pEoPlE SaY tHiS EvErY wEeK.”

You’d be right to say that, but you’d be wrong to say that right now is anything but an absolutely terrible state of the game, probably the worst ever.  Let’s look at the last 5 or so additions to the game.

We’ve got balloons (good with re-deploy, terrible now), turrets (originally overpowered, now terrible), planes (literally flying turrets, overpowered), six shooter (terrible), and the Infinity Blade, which I don’t think I have to say anything more about. This game is heading down a very very bad path right now and you’d be fooling yourself to say that it isn’t.",FortniteCompetitive

2. epic needs to stop forcing stupid shit like zombies and mythic swords, overpowered planes etc on everyone that wants to play REAL Fortnite which we all fell in love with.
3. stop adding overpowered weapons which seems to not been tested out at all *cough* the turret *cough*.
4. If they want to add seasonal stuff like zombies or stuff like swords etc, put it in a LTM and dont mess with the core game for the people that want to play REAL Fortnite.

They need to understand what they are doing is not okay.

Having planes with no gas tank or whatever allowed players to do nothing all game but stay in the sky.

Please stop spamming that it’s the sword when this tourney has been the most exciting and with the most action that we’ve seen. The people with the sword were easily killed by those who were simply paying attention and “S Keying.” Those who are complaining that the sword is OP only saw the people being killed because they weren’t paying attention and thinking they could outbuild something that destroys builds (lul).

I understand wanting to make a flashy game that's very ""in your face"" but this wasn't the way to go about it. You have one regular play mode and the sword is in every iteration of it (solo/duo/squads) and it sucks. You spend an entire game farming mats, making good plays and winning duels only to have to face some dude with a sword at the end who is basically given an unfair advantage.



I'm not a pro player, i have a couple wins, i am never going to win a 1v1 vs someone with a sword who has half a brain. And when i lose to something like that, it's beyond defeating. I don't even bother re-queuing because in the back of my head, i'm just going to face the same situation again. 



It's not even the item itself, it's the fact only one person can get it. That one single person now has an insanely larger advantage to win the game. Planes and turrets are annoying, but at least multiple players can acquire them. **The sword should have been an LTM Epic.** Everyone knows this including yourself, and it blows my mind you thought it belonged in the regular game playlist.",FortniteCompetitive

I joined this sub to learn from top tier players so that I could up my game, that is mostly gone now.  All it is is people complaining about what they think the game should or should not be.  Even the 'pros' are doing this and many of them are doing it in a very disrespectful manner.  

&amp;#x200B;

If top tier individuals want to be pros and be taken seriously, start acting like it.  You make thousands of dollars off this game if not more.  If you want Epic to take you seriously maybe stop cussing them out on twitter, in videos, and publicly.  Realistically how many other professionals at the top of their professions act like as big as babies as do the 'pros' in this game?  When was the last time you heard a top tier quarterback in the NFL bitch out Rodger Goodell over a rule or game change he didn't like?  Never, he might disagree but is is always in a respectful manner when done publicly.  You can still have a voice.

&amp;#x200B;

As with everyone at the top of their profession, the goal as a top tier player is to take the game as it comes and adapt and get better to win/do better.  Not complain about an item you don't like or want nerfed to change the game back to the way it was when the game was maybe 'easier' for your because you didn't have to deal with redeploy, planes, or a sword.  You don't hear professional  basketball players asking to get rid of the 3pt line because Steph Curry is dropping bombs on them and their game is better suited to 2pt shots.  They adapt their game.  When you complain about the game that has given you so much you turn off the causal fan, which is YOUR bread and butter. Many of your streams have become toxic because of all the hate for the game.  The actual good content of this sub even gets pushed to the bottom because of all the whining posts.

Casual fans/players, it is OUR job to bitch about the changes, because WE are the bread and butter of Epic, not the pros.   
 Pros can/will be easily replaced by someone else who is just as hungry, but the millions of casuals cannot.

They had to see the overwhelming backlash yesterday, right? They're active on Reddit as we speak, pushing hitch fixes and ""adjusting"" the sword. I love this game, but man. As a casual player, I feel extremely sorry for the competitive players that sacrificed other goals to pursue a career with this game. 

I feel like showcasing these guys personal stories was even more of a slap in the face to their sacrifices. It's more than just a game when your livelihood is on the line and you have bills to pay. In Bizzle's ""story"" that they aired during the skirmish yesterday, I believe he says he abandoned a potential career in Cyber Security to pursue this. I imagine a ton of other players made similar sacrifices. 

Not everyone is a successful streamer. For a lot of these guys, being top performers at tourneys IS their main source of income. Yesterday made it pretty clear that Epic has zero regard for the amount of practice put in and/or the obligations these players abandoned to dedicate themselves to this game.

I don't know man, it's just very off-putting to me. I've spent a lot of money on this game, but yesterday almost made me feel guilty for doing so. It felt like a giant spit in the face to the players who essentially made their game rise to the level it's gotten to. ",FortniteCompetitive

* Planes should not be able to move/bump players, period
* Planes should do considerably less collision damage to players
* Planes should only be able to be in the air for two minutes max. When on the ground, they will replenish fuel passively
* Possibly revert the 25 damage to the player when the plane is blown up following these nerfs

These are the changes I care most about since I'm assuming the Infinity Blade won't be in the game much longer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Infinity Blade**

The ideal situation is to remove this disaster as soon as possible, but I think we can make this horrific accident into something positive. The following suggestions will obviously need to be tweaked, that goes without saying. 

* Make the Infinity Blade into a balanced melee weapon that is a healthy addition to Fortnite
* Takes up one item slot
* Can be found in chests and floor loot
* Primary Fire does 50 damage to players and the same amount of damage to structures as a pickaxe
* Alternate Fire is a medium ranged lunge (3 tiles) that does no damage to players but does x2 damage to structures
* Shorten both the Primary Fire and Alternate Fire animation from the Infinity Blade Primary Fire and Alternate Fire animation
* No additional abilities, obviously

(Paid ranked mode concept),"Now this is an idea I just had, and I doubt it is original, but I haven't seen it before on this sub and I have a feeling it will be controversial at best if not poorly recieved. 




What if epic added a paid ranked game mode? I was thinking that since epic clearly is cash driven in the way they're handling the game, why not just give them what they want in exchange for what we want? Specifically, I had the idea of something like the battle pass but that includes access to a ranked playlist of each game type (solos, duos and squads) that run 24/7 and perhaps includes ranked rewards that you unlock at different ""tiers"" in the ranked pass. This could be as cheap as 5 or 10 bucks and could perhaps even be paid for with vbucks so that free to play players could get in to ranked. 





I know it feels wrong to pay a company that regularly screws over our community even more money, but in the long run we really have to ask ourselves if we want to continue this vicious cycle of asking for something we want for free or whether we're willing to put our money where our mouth is. If we did this I really think devs would be more willing to listen to community feedback as it would directly relate to how many people of all skill levels would want to be involved.

I cant think of any gadgets or weapons in these games that allows you to get free kills...

None of these other BR games have game changing gadgets / vehicles which turn the tide of a fight.

The skill is balanced around what an individual player can do with the games mechanics to win the game.

100 players is more than enough of a challenge and now we have planes in a Battle Royale. Swords, Turrets, Quad Launchers. Dynamite, Grappler Gun. Anything EpicGames can think of literally get shoehorned into the game with no regard of balancing.

Every single item that gets added to the game always ends up being adjusted / nerfed because there is always a blatant balance issue that goes over their heads.

We can't get customs, we can't get a 24/7 ranked mode. 

We get a game format that EVERYONE likes. Yet they are prolonging adding it into the game, yet they will add game changing items like planes and *1* sword without looking back or even testing in an LTM.

Pro players have discussed their disdain. Even ninja (their no.1 money maker) said the games current state is saddening. 

What more can we do?

However i still like playing this game so until Epic makes the changes we want, we have to deal with it as frustrating as that is.

So how do you go about fighting someone with the sword?

Im mainly referring to 1v1 scenarios here, since i just avoid early game Polar Peak because its a massive shitshow so i only encounter the sword around top 10

The best way i can think is by maintaining distance and chunking him as much as possible with AR or Sniper

I know you can outrun the right click slash but any decent player will combo that with the left click leap so it becomes almost impossible to maintain any distance for long

What ive gathered from the Winter Royale Qualifiers today is that when he inevitably leaps right beside you the best thing you can do is build up a couple stories high to avoid his slash and try to get some shotgun shots off

Its seems like building a jungle gym might be a good way to deal with him, since he wont be able to keep track of you and you can get edit shotgun shots off on him and whatnot

Its kinda like playing against Thanos all over again, only this is 100 times harder

It really feels like fighting a final bossfight everytime and you have to massively outplay him to even have a chance, but instead of a well thought out intelligent boss its just some random kid spamming right and left click hoping he gets you

I have been getting hate about how I'm unskilled ever since the last game of the 2nd Heat when I mindlessly won the game with the new blade. In no way am I trying to defend the implementation of the blade, instead I'm trying to defend myself. It seems that all the work that I have put into this game, playing hours on end everyday trying to improve, is going down the drain because the 3 points that I earned prior to using the blade has basically gone unnoticed. All of it is being covered up by one stupid game where I used a broken weapon and now people are making it out like I undeservingly qualified for the finals and it really sucks.

Just because I'm not a top tier player or a popular streamer doesn't mean that you can just throw someone under the bus like that. It wasn't like I was trying to abuse the blade or anything. I never tried to hot drop the spot or even fight for it. In the game that I had the blade, the player that originally got it off spawn chased me from Shifty to around Fatal through a rift and I ended up killing him. If I didn't take the blade, then someone else would've. This is a tournament. Every player is playing to win and if the weapon helps me win, then shouldn't I take it? I thought it was as simple as that, but I guess it wasn't. So lastly, I want to apologize to all of those that I killed during the tournament with the sword and I want to apologize to everyone for picking it up.

In case you guys didn’t know Dota’s last TI had a prize pop of over 25 million. 

Dota is one of the most iconic Esports in the world right now.

If something is goi g wrong mid tournament with an obvious exploit. It is needed as soon as humanly possible. 

The game is designed around the competitive environment completely and Ice Frog balances the game in such a way that the entire roster of over 120 heros are playable in the highest level of play. 

This is no small feat.

League of legends doesn’t even come close to this kind of balance as they don’t even see 50 % of their roster being played in any given tournament.

Epic has many many developers who have been in the competitive gaming scene for years who they could lol to for examples of how to govern your games competitive scene.

I hope they learn something and stop abusing the passion of fortnites young competitive community. 

This game could live for the next decade..competitive fortnite needs to bloom and they need to take their heads out of their asses and start taking it seriously.

That is where the most passion is within their community. 

My 2 sons are off and on with fortnite now and are moving in my other games and genres.kids ebb and flow with their interests. They will learn that the competitive community truly is the lifeblood of their game , I just hope it’s not too late. 

Fuck epic right now. I’ve gotten to the point where I can’t even play the game anymore.

The speed at which people turned on Epic is insane. It seems not that long ago this community was glorifying Epic for their open qualifiers and Pop Up Cups. I remember reading posts about how awesome and how much fun people were having playing the with shield gain and mat gain on kill. This community was thanking Epic for giving everyone a chance at this Skirmish. It seems Epic made a slip up, and rather than realizing this and understanding they make mistakes, this community grabbed pitchforks and criticized them in a very toxic and non-constructive way. I am all for constructive criticism, but the speed at which you turn on Epic when it is convenient troubles me. Yes, they messed up today, but there is always tomorrow and the best way to create change is by sending out constructive criticism. So, rather than flaming with no idea on how to fix the issue, realize Epic is composed of humans too, and that the best way to make change is foster debate and put out suggestions that you think will help.",FortniteCompetitive

The two primary reasons for this are: 

1. It is the most effective way of letting EPIC know that we dislike what they're doing, and probably the quickest way to get them to learn from this.
2. As players of the game, we should hold power over epic, and not the other way around. 

**It is the most effective way of letting EPIC know that we dislike what they're doing.**

At any company that involves tech, aka programming and coding, I can guarantee you that they record the shit out of user activity, and monitor the numbers like hawks. EPIC is no exception. I'm a software engineer at a top-5 largest tech company in the world, and I guarantee you that **numbers,** like daily active users, are what moves these companies. No one loses sleep over ""bad customer experience"", but **nobody** is sleeping if there's an outage that causes even 10% of our customers to take their business elsewhere. Thus, the quickest way to let epic know their decision was bad is to impact the way these numbers move. This point about data is also important in item #2.

&amp;#x200B;

**As players of the game, we should hold power over epic. not the other way around.**

Think about it: the only real bargaining chip we have when bargaining with epic is ""or else I'm not playing."" What I mean by this is that if you spend hours and hours on reddit complaining about new patches, but log on everyday, play 5 hours, and continually buy items from the shop, why should EPIC care about your opinion? Whether they piss you off or make you happy with their changes, you give them the same profit, so ultimately, your opinion is the most weakly regarded. Imagine, for example, if I want glider redeploy readded, and you don't. Your argument is ""you better not add it, or I'm going to quit"", while my argument is ""You better add it, or i'm going to keep playing your game and spending my money."" It's a no brainer for who's side to take. This problem is particularly big in the competitive community because we're the ones who have invested the most time into this game, which makes it all the harder for us to quit. But it's time we let epic know that our voices matter just as much as the bots who quit because we stomped them too hard, and the only way to do that is to put some bite in our bark. You've lived a significant amount of your life without Fortnite, and you can certainly go without it again.",FortniteCompetitive

Some Maths and Science and Logic to follow:

&amp;#x200B;

Basically Game Theory says that a rational player should do their best to make the most possible money. Since there is uncertainty in the outcome of the game, you should take whatever strategy maximizes your Expected Value (EV) from your strategy (the % chance of success multiplied times the value of the reward). If you aren't familiar with the concept from Poker or some other game, as a simple example if you are offered a chance to play a game where you roll a dice and you get two choices: either choose to win $1 if the dice result is a number from 1 to 5, or choose to win $10 if you roll a 6, you should take the long shot to roll the 6 every time. The EV of 1 to 5 is (5/6\*$1= 83 cents) and the EV of trying to roll a 6 is (1/6\*$10= $1.67). So you'd win twice as much in the long run if you played for the longshot, and even if you play once you're better off playing for the longshot UNLESS the $1 is extremely important to you and you don't care much about winning more than $1.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory)

&amp;#x200B;

Given the messed up state of S7 with the Sword and planes (and the powerful combination of having both at once), and the very top heavy prize pool, and the guaranteed income of $1,500 for 21st to 100th place; the majority of players in the Finals should adopt the optimal strategy of taking the longshot attempt to zerg the Sword. The reason for this is that **there is no difference between sweaty turtling and scoring 1-2 points and placing in the top 50 or even the top 30 versus dying on spawn in five straight games.** I'm writing this midway through NA Heat 2, and so far Neace and Psalm  and Heat 2 games 1-2 have shown that the Sword is not only the best way to Big Bonus your way to first or second place, but it is also the most reliable way to make it into the top placements every game because of your high health pool, regeneration while other players turtle, easy farming, and great rotation options. By getting the sword you not only give yourself the best chance to take that $75,000 first prize, but you also give yourself the best chance to get a solid score and place top 10.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if you drop the Sword with 50 other players, and only have a 2% chance to get the sword, you now have a very high probability to get enough points to double or triple your prize money or maybe even multiply it by 30-50x if you get a Big Bonus game. That is better odds than the normal 1% chance of getting the Victory Royale.  Most players do not have enough of a natural competitive advantage to have a high probability of generating extremely high point totals through playing straight up. There are exceptions to this for the true top 10-20 players in the game who have a decent probability of popping off without the sword and having high chances of deep placements, but for the majority of players in the game they are better off gambling on getting a gun and getting the sword than they are gambling on avoiding plane and sword aggro and gambling on avoiding better players and gambling on getting zone. The sword is so powerful that Chap got it and could literally just goof off making giant signs on Polar Peak without fear of reprisal. Getting the sword is the strategy with highest probability of success.  

&amp;#x200B;

Sword Zerg is also self-reinforcing. Because if you join the Sword Zerg and get a gun, your odds of getting at least one point from killing part of the rest of the Zerg is higher than your odds of getting 3+ kills in a regular match. This effect won't kick in until the Sword Zerg gets big enough that a substantial number of people don't get a gun, but that is probably only 10 or so players. (So if you 50/50 a gun, and then get to face 2 more people without guns, you have a 50% chance of gun and 90% chance of getting the kills against unarmed opponents. So odds of getting 3+ kills are .5\*.9\*.9=40% whereas odds of winning any other regular fight are roughly 50% so getting three kills is .5\*.5\*.5=12.5% chance of getting a point for 3 kills).

&amp;#x200B;

At some point there are diminishing returns to the ""Zerg the Sword"" strategy because if enough people Zerg it then the rest of the map is much safer and the odds of success elsewhere go up, and the odds of being able to kill the sword carrier in mid/late game without getting third partied go up with smaller population as well. But it's equally clear that in the Qualifier Heats we are not even remotely close to reaching the point of diminishing returns because only a handful of people were dropping sword. If only 6 people drop Sword like they have been that gives you a 15% chance of getting sword and having a VERY good chance of a late run and possibility of big bonus. That's incredible, and you get to do it five different games!  I'd guess that if you are in the bottom 50 of Finals Qualifiers it probably doesn't make sense for you to do anything except Zerg Sword unless at least 30-50 people are sword zerging. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look at Neace. He would be the first to admit he isn't in the same class as the top players in the game, even though I think he absolutely belongs in the top 50-100 players and has consistently performed like that (and is a really cool dude with a great channel you should check out). From literally ONE good game with the sword, he got second place in the Qualifiers. In the finals that means he would have won 40 times as much money as if he had gotten only 3 points and gotten 21st place or worse. Even a small chance of having that one pop-off game is so valuable it becomes the game theory optimal strategy for many players. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:** If you aren't clearly a Top 25 player, your optimal strategy before tomorrow is probably to only practice hot dropping perfectly at Polar Peak to go for a gun, get kills, and then make a play for the sword. It maximizes the chance you will do better than 21st place, and thus maximizes your likely income from the Finals.  

&amp;#x200B;

PS - Sadly, most people in the Finals will not do the optimal thing, either out of fear of looking stupid for dying on spawn (See Prospect Theory [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_theory) on why people fear losing more than they like winning, and because of the Overconfidence Effect [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence\_effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect) which means they overestimate their chances of getting into the top 21, and especially their chances of getting into the big money in the top 5 or so).

Personally I’m not a fan, HOWEVER I do understand EPIC’s need to constantly add new things and keep the game fresh. Though I think it could of been implemented differently, and I think intentionally adding crazy ass mechanics right before tourneys if going to alienate and irritate the pro player-base. 

I also don’t think casuals are gonna have too much fun unless they happen to be the one that gets the sword.

I’ve been playing since season 1 and I’ve always given everything a shot before forming my opinions but recently the game just seems to be more and more unbalanced, while breeding more and more bugs at the same time.

I also feel like EPIC is extremely fortunate to not have any real competition as far as players in the genre currently, since companies like activision are ass and end up shooting themselves in the foot. However, I do think that competitively this game couldn’t be further from a true E-sport in it’s current stage.

With the release of [v.7.01](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/patch-notes/v7-01), we expect an increase in the number of posts revolving around the Infinity Sword and the plane! Please use this megathread to discuss your thoughts on the new item/mechanics and how it affects the competitive scene and normal games. 

We will be removing duplicate posts and redirecting them to this thread so we can reduce the amount of frequently posted topics when something new drops  We hope this is something you enjoy, and let us know what you think about this, by dropping feedback in the comments. ",FortniteCompetitive

People complained about the double barrel, but I thought it was pretty balanced since if you were more than 1 building tile away you couldn’t do much damage. Turrets were OP in the beginning, but they fixed the hitboxes and nerfed it so it’s balanced now. Planes are somewhat counterable. I’ve gotten lasered inside one even when trying to maneuver, and if they tried to ram into you, you could hop in and kill the guy. Turrets are good against them too. But watching the winter royale, the sword is actually the worst thing they added to the game. 400hp, regent health over time, can jump like 20 ft., it’s op. I don’t know why it’s not an LTM. The guy who gets it in the winter royale gets an easy 10 kill game. Don’t know who’s idea was this or how they didn’t think this would happen.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic is giving competitive Fortnite a huge middle finger right now. 

Comp Fortnite players are the dancing monkeys at this point. There's absolutely no reason to implement these types of changes at this moment, but they did. No one at Epic, who was making the big decisions, thought this was a bad idea because this is just a showcase to them. 

They put in a lot of money into the tourney's to get the best players around and then just put in huge game-changing items the day of and tell them all to dance and smile for the post-game interviews.

They're just products. They don't care about how long it took for them to get there. They don't care how much they practiced building, rotating, shooting, or scrimming. The juxtaposition of the Bizzle documentary and then them cutting to some dude with a big ass sword cutting through every's builds is seemingly ironic. They're just there to showcase while Epic says, ""Look at what you could possibly do in our game, so come play because it's wacky and cooky and crazy (buy our skins)"".

Please, Fortnite pros, schedule a walk out, or something so Epic knows this stuff isn't cool.",FortniteCompetitive

The Sword is a completely broken item. It gives you increased mobility, easy rotations, 400 total health that regenerates, and can't be countered by turtling. From a spectator standpoint seeing the busted item in action is a fucking must watch spectacle. Watching Neace and psalm run through people with that shit was MUST see content.

Everyone knows where the sword is and has the option to go get it. If you're competing for a chance at a million dollars, why wouldn't you use a busted item that the developers intentionally put in the game? That's life changing money, do whatever it takes. The Sword is also making it easier for the production crew to follow the action since its heavily contested off spawn and allows for crazy plays at end game.

The reactions from Twitch chat and the streamers is all great entertainment whether it be Ninja raging or Chap laughing at the mayhem the Sword causes at endgame adds immensely to the entertainment value of the winter skirmish.

The next controversial addition to the tourney is the planes. They did not add much of an entertainment value to the tourney because everyone who got one was just basically camping in mid air till endgame unless they decided to kamikaze someone or got shot out.

Epic is still trying to find that perfect balance between competitive integrity and showmanship it's up to us as a community to provide as much constructive criticism so that they can get it right.

For ages people both here and on the main sub have complained about it. The Infinity Sword not only gives an entertaining early game objective for people to fight over. The sword is a  contestable item making it so that the more people respect it the more you have to earn it to actually get it (unlike other overpowered weapons in the past) and also i truly don't think the sword is even overpowered.   


Is it good for killing people hiding in little boxes while no one's looking at you? Sure but that's exactly the sort of gameplay i think everyone's wanted to change in Competitive for ages. The second anyone actually looks at the person and tries to fight them the sword wielder has gotten killed.  


The sword hasn't won a game yet. All it's done is punish pencil warriors hiding in boxes doing nothing. Discouraging that sort of gameplay and incentivising  higher risk/reward and more exciting games is EXACTLY what we need. Meanwhile we got a dozen + planes up in the sky doing nothing but waiting out the game. Planes are currently boring and non-engaging in competitive. The Sword is entertaining and leads to more exciting games for everyone to watch. Bring on the downvotes.",FortniteCompetitive

Since this is a wall of text, I wanted to make it a separate post.

Main problem: most people here don't realise that the reason we don't have a ranked mode is VERY LIKELY not because EPIC doesn't want one explicitely, or that they hate you competitive players, or that this mode will split the community, or that there will be smurfs.

None of that shit really matters.

What you should be asking yourself is why it might not be in the game yet, and what needs to be addressed before there's a competitive system.

Let's just start logistically, EPIC clearly hasn't found their ''competitive format'' yet and are still working on it. Before you implement any sort of ranked system in ANY game, your very 1st thing is clearly to figure out how do players RANK on your system.

What is the distribution of points for X/Y/Z actions (placements, damage, kills, etc).

I know most people here have no experience in game design, but it should be quite obvious that games with ranks in mind all have to answer a bunch of questions and put an infrastructure in place before they can launch a competitive season.

**Here are a few questions for Fortnite:**

Are there different rules in the ranked system than normal games?

Are there weapons/items that are not going to be in the ranked system?

If so, which ones, and who decides, or what make an item OK for ranks and another not?

How is the match making going to work?

ALSO this isn't League of Legends with 10 players in a game.

A BR format with 80-100 players in a game creates IMMENSE issues with match making.

If you've ever played PUBG, you know how shitty that can end up being if done wrong.

How do we deal with high-elo OR low population times?

Does EPIC A) Keep competitive integrity and make you wait as long as necessary to find players of your skill (which could literally take hours in the case of FN) or B) Have the match making eventually put you in the same lobbies as people WAY above your ELO or WAY below.

League does this to a certain extent, so if the option B is selected, then does the player earn way less ELO for this match because he is playing with people below him?

If so, how much?

As an OG League player myself, I can tell you 1 hour long queues were a thing, and thats to only have TEN players at similar elos play in the same games.

Imagine with 100.

**Another option that Riot Games did in multiple servers (LAN/LAS) is only allow ranked games to be played at certain times to make sure everyone who wants to play ranks is there at those times and the match making is the best and quickest.

The pop-up cups COULD be EPIC's way of testing this format of ranks for the future, we just don't know. 

ALSO, when you have a game like Fortnite, which EPIC clearly didn't intend to be a competitive game (they just brought it out randomly after seeing how popular BR games were, please remember that), and you then make the statement that you're making a ''ranked queue'', you THEN set an expectation from players that the game must be absolutely balanced at all costs.

Again, keep in mind I'm repeating EPIC's words here, but they seem to want to run the game FIRST and foremost for fun and allow themselves as much freedom to alter the map, add items, remove items, make changes that they feel will make the game more fun.

Do the ranks get a ''fixed map'', or they also get the ever changing map we have now and also all the new items added to the game constantly?

If so, won't that enrage the competitive community every time changes are made to their favourite spot they've been using to grind ELO for the past year? (That's an example)

See at the moment EPIC has the perfect argument/excuse anytime something is not ''balanced''.

They just say ''well look we're not balancing the game around competitive, we're just making fun items and adding them, pro players should be the ones adapting to our changes''.

Which of course is true for now.

When you create a ranked-mode, you also then give a lot of your creative power to the competitive scene and pro players.

And trust me that's something we've seen in League of Legends. 

You will have a LOT less creative freedom when your community of pros goes on OUTRAGE mode every time you add something they don't like, which then leads to more drama, then leads to players leaving and the average player maybe also influenced by the vocal minority of pros.

Look at how crazy this sub is right now every time something is added into the game, and yet we don't even have a ranked mode yet.

Imagine people losing their rank/promos due to a new item like the plane.

NOW people will have a reason to be mad, they actually are losing something because of a change EPIC has made.

----

TL;DR: Most games with a ranked system are BUILT around having a ranked system and their balance/design/changes all take the ranks and competitive integrity into consideration.

League of Legends was MADE as an esports game and trust me everything from game design, the way the maps, gold is earned, the core mechanics, were thought of with the idea of ranks in mind.

EVEN WITH THAT IN MIND, the game came out in October of 2009 and the ranks ONLY started a year later in July of 2010.

You guys are expecting a ranked system RIGHT NOW in a game that has only been out for a year that WASN'T even designed with ranks in mind.

This shit TAKES TIME.

Ranks will come, EPIC has to figure shit out, hire the right people to make this work, and eventually there's a high probability it will be added to the game.

It's not because they HATE you competitive players, or anything like that, it's MOSTLY a logistical problem.",FortniteCompetitive

1. Drop polar. Note specifically how many people and where they are. 
2. Find a safe place with decent loot to kill everybody or secure the blade.
3. Pick up the sword and break all of polar peak to get close to max wood + brick
4. Take the zip line southeast of the mountain to the plane spawns
5a. Take the plane to max height and disengage from all fights until mid game, no need to engage earlier. If you get shot down, follow step 6.
5b. If you need more materials, drop at a rural areas - (Wailing for wood, Fatal quarry for brick, Containers for metal etc..)
6. Drop out of the plane whenever accordingly, or if you get shot down. put yourself in solid positioning, and 3rd party fights, picking up eliminations
7. When you have a satisfactory amount of kills and want to play for the win, sit in a box as not to take damage or fights 
8. Look for early and quick rotations with your leap to give time to heal if poked down
9. When last zone closes in break all builds with your leap allowing nobody else to heal, then turtle to not take damage.
10. You will win the heal off making others not able to heal, leaving you the victor.

1- create an LTM for the Sword as it has no place in the regular playlist as it is fairly unbalanced, either that or remove the ability to build from the sword holder.  

2- either reduce the health of planes or make the pilot receive more damage once it is destroyed and a bit damage when he crashes it on the ground, only time he doesn't get damaged is when he reverses it.


This is really important, as we just want to have fun. And flying a plane for the whole game while you are trying to shoot it down and getting third party then crashed on isn't fun. 

Having someone that builds swings a sword builds and jump out of no where.. isn't fun.

Winter Royale is about to be a joke.,"Let me start off by saying I love Fortnite. For the past 8 years I haven't really played video games, Fortnite changed that because it's an amazing game. Before Fortnite I only watched esports events a few times and wasn't even entertained. Fortnite has been absolutely amazing and the competitive scene has been very enjoyable. With that being said, I don't know WTF Epic is thinking. 

&amp;#x200B;

As many of you are well aware the Infinity Blade dropped a couple of hours ago and I'd argue that it has changed the game more than Glider Redeploy. I'm not just talking about changing the game at the competitive level, but changing just regular PUB matches completely. First, if you don't drop in Polar Peak, you won't be able to find anyone. Literally, have the lobby is dropping at Polar Peak to test the sword and I believe it will be like that for at least a few more week (depending on how long this sword stays in-game). Most of my lobbies are under 15 people before the first storm closes. THATS CRAZY! 

&amp;#x200B;

While I care about regular pub matches because I'm a filthy casual it's not what I care about the most. The competitive scene around Fortnite is far more interesting to me and I spend about an hour a day just watch pro streams. When a big event like a Summer Skirmish or Winter Royale is about to drop I'm hyped, to say the least. I find it by far the most interesting sport going on right now... With that being said when game-breaking changes take place that will affect the comp scene it certainly affects me.  

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not gonna lie, I thought planes were stupid and they have certainly changed the end-game at the comp level drastically. The best players I've watched in scrims have virtually all involved planes in their winning strat. A quarter of the scrim streams I watch are literally just people doing circles until they get dropped. In addition to that, I was able to drop 20 points in the exploror cup on mobile JUST because of the planes. Planes are broken and 99% of the pros hate them. 

&amp;#x200B;

As many of us are aware there was a patch scheduled this morning and many people were speculating as to what changes we might face. In all honesty, I thought Planes were gonna get nerfed to hell considering WR was today. That bit was slightly true, but not really. Planes still have quadcrasher mode and you only lose 25hp (lol?) when it's destroyed. That's not even close to enough risk to force players out of planes during scrims but I digress. Planes suck, but honestly, it's not even close to the fucking infinity blade. Who was the psychopath at Epic who thought this would be a good idea? Literally hours before Winter Royale.... 

&amp;#x200B;

The comp community has been screaming for Epic to cut the gimmicky items. The balloons, The turrets, The flying turrets, but they just won't stop. The game is literally in a broken state, but they just keep adding these ridiculous items. But.....The infinity blade is no gimmicky item. This thing is virtually a free win in pubs. You get 400! Hp/Shield and you're always regening. You get 130% movement + free movement in scrims when using the jump/lunge abilities. Not only is it free movement, but it rips through all builds making it like an anytime impulse in scrims. Can anyone imagine this item in scrims? Because I have been for the past 30 minutes and it's the most overpowered thing I can see. 

&amp;#x200B;

This thing WILL change WR unless it's removed. I'd highly rec Epic getting rid of this before all the pros wake up. This is a fortnitemares level obstruction and if it stays, you can bet your bottom dollar a lot of winners will win because they had the sword.

This isn’t how “eSports” works! Epic Games you need to stop advertising this game even as remotely competitive because all these skirmishes and “Pro-AM” Tournament were just huge advertisements for the game and they just attached a prize pool to it.

You guys can cater to both the casual and competitive market in a very simple way. Just make two separate playlists as simple as that. You guys have enough money to hire a new testing team for competitive modes. In CS:GO you have two playlists competitive and casual with completely different rules! How hard is that for you guys to implement something like that in Fortnite?

Please epic I don’t want this game to go the same route as paragon because I really like this game..

Thanks for reading this was just my 2 cents..",FortniteCompetitive

I remember everyday I was getting upset about how little Epic was doing to actually help the Comp scene but it's done. Open your eyes. They don't care.

I’m just looking to see some opinions on whether I should make the switch. 
I feel like I’ve reached my best with controller and it doesn’t even feel rewarding getting kills anymore.  Have been considering getting one for the past few months and I’m stuck on the fence, the reason I’m hesitant is because FN and CSGO are about the only games I’d play on it. But It looks amazing and when you get used to keyboard I’m sure it’d be better. Opinions???",FortniteCompetitive

-

Ironically, the current Burst Rifle is actually worse to be used as a close and far range weapon. The burst is too slow for close range and the spread is too much for far range. It's only sweet spot is from medium range. I don't think you would ever pulled out your Burst Rifle to be used as your close up finisher in a build fight after a shotgun shot. That's why people use the AR. It's like a slower SMG but still maintaining those consistent shot tempo.

- 

In other words, I want to proposed a change to the Burst Rifle's burst speed. Right now, it took almost a second to shoot from the first burst to the second. I tried timed it multiple times and average it to be exact of 0.85 seconds. 

All I'm saying let's try reduce that time to 0.5s and see how the gun feels like then. I'm sure it will more reliable than what it is. ",FortniteCompetitive

# Why mentality can make or break a team?

When playing scrims/tournaments you have to be prepared. Many players don't realize how important it is to prepare yourself mentally for scrims or tournaments. Especially when playing with teammates. ""Why would you rotate that way, you're terrible at this game!"" This one sentence can make your teammates play worst. ""Don't worry man you could have done this \_\_\_\_\_ to avoid dying."" This can affect your teammates in a positive way by giving constructive criticism but being polite. Being toxic/rude can hurt every players decision making skills. That is why you must prepare yourself mentally for the worst to come and be there for your teammates.

 

# How to prepare yourself mentally.

Before playing a scrim/tournament or anything that can cause you stress find something that can relax you. Usually everytime i play scrims or a tournament i take a shower. A wonderful way to prepare yourself mentally and physically is by stretching. Dr. Levi Harrison has useful tips to exercise your hands and wrists before playing.

# Conclusion.

To succeed as a team or as a player you must be prepared to move quickly and be smart. With a good mental state you can play at your best. Thanks for checking our the forum! This is my first forum and i'm happy to help anyone that has a question!

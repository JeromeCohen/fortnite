 People are more and more raging because of deaths that they couldn't help. 

Fix this.

 I have quit the game now, and many others will join me after a month of this meta. Your game can still be fixed, but don't wait untill it can't be fixed anymore. If the game is going to go like this for more than a month i will say to you that i am 99% surre that 50% of the people who played it have quitted.

See a company is about the money, and i see that.... But fortnite was in the season 1-3 days not only about money. I felt like EpicGames really listend to the community. Now they just make the dicision on what makes them the most amount of money. ex. apealing to the noob player so they will still buy a skin.

This will kill the game on a short amount of time. Maybe you make now a lot of money, but over a month or so you aren't anymore.

I am sorry that i had to put this negativity on this reddit page but i just enjoyed the days in season 1-3 and it has comme to a point were you have bloom based battles. 

I quit Fortnite, 

But maybe not forever.

Thanks for reading.

2,Pay2WinPlease,1534776032,98u586,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/98u586/wishlist_for_fnbr_an_attempt_to_make_it_less/,0,Wishlist for FNBR - An attempt to make it less random.,"For introductions sake my IGN on PC is Destined2Rise and I've been playing FNBR since it came out in August last year. I like to think of myself as a pretty decent builder but I'm probably not as good at FN as I should be having played the game since August.

This is my wishlist for FN and hopefully a way to start a discussion with the devs and the community about giving FN a long lifetime; alongside each point I will explain my reasoning and in the comments please do ask any questions or debate with me about our opinions on the game. TL;DR is highlighted in bold at the start of each bullet point however please only comment with suggestions if you have read everything!

1. **The big one, removing bloom.** There's been a lot of controversy around this topic, especially since Ged's [""Fortnite is finally dying video""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGJ6rD3Gz28). But I don't see how anyone can defend a system that promotes RNG shooting and hurts the better player. Of course we do have a couple ""band-aids"" over bloom like First Shot Accuracy but this does not make up for fact that shooting is completely RNG, especially since in a game like Fortnite it is vital to keep moving fast. The common misconception is that bloom would be added with no other changes, recoil should be added to the guns and more damage drop-off should also be added. You could also make an argument for realistic bullet mechanics that add travel time to the bullets.
2. **Nerf to SMGs.** This one does come under the umbrella of removing bloom but it really does rub me the wrong way. If bloom is not going to be removed in the near future we need to have a shotgun meta, shotguns, the scoped AR and the snipers are the only consistent weapons in the game and if bloom isn't being removed we need to have a bigger emphasis on these weapons. I encourage people to try out the scoped AR, whilst it doesn't compete with the AR or Scar it does feel very satisfying to consistently land hits on players.
3. **Changes to material gathering.** For those of you who weren't around during Blitz V1 please go back and watch some of the numerous gameplays on YT from that mode. This is what FN should be normally - perhaps not the faster storm, but definitely the increased material gain. The fact that to have tense exciting build offs a player must spend most of the game farming materials is insane and defeats the whole purpose of a shooter. The focus should be on fighting players not mindlessly hitting trees and rocks.
4. **Changes to vending machines.** Vending machines should be given a 100% spawn chance, be more common around the map, only have consumables and traps and have the resource requirement decreased. This would encourage players to fight more because currently the best inventory is AR - SHOTGUN - SMG / SNIPER / MEDS / MEDS. Most of the time players will carry minis and either shields or medkits. This makes it a lot harder for a player to get back to full HP after a fight and be ready to fight another player. It also means that if you are hurt you need to hope that you get lucky and someone left a shield potion or medkit in one of the houses. With lower cost, consumable only vending machines it would give players the ability to know where they are going to be and easily get meds. 
5. **Reimplementation of smoke grenades.** When they were in the game I always used to use them because of how fun it was to smoke out one of the buildings in Tilted and run from the guy who got a pump first. While they were buggy and not very good they were always funny to use. My suggested change would be make the smoke impossible to see through (similar to R6S) make them activate on impact with a surface and make them in stacks of 5 up to 20. It would also be an indirect buff to the thermal scope as it would be able to see through the smoke. - This may need close attention to make sure it didn't become super OP like Glaz was in R6S.
6. **Changes to Legendary Pistols. The deagle** before it's damage drop off nerf was a meme weapon for fortnite kill compilations. Now it is something to be avoided completely and has no place in a player's arsenal. The deagle is never likely to be much more than a meme weapon, it is inherent in it's nature however I would like to see the drop off change reverted so I can go back to cross map sniping people for a bit of fun. **The suppressed pistol** is in need of some serious changes, perhaps an increased fire rate, changing it's rarity from Legendary / Purple to Purple / Blue. Unsure of what could be done to make this a somewhat useful weapon, perhaps a serious overhaul on the sort of ""sneaky silencers"" playstyle perhaps by adding a suppressed variant of the hunting rifle?
7. **A way of reviving dead players.** In squads if one of your friends dies right off the bat it is a massive disadvantage in terms of winning the game, but also very boring for the friend that has to watch you / play a solo game for the next 20-30 minutes. If there was some sort of challenge / killstreak that would allow you to resurrect a teammate perhaps with only some basic equipment such as grey AR - Shotgun - smg - 3 minis - 1 medkit. That sort of thing. **HOWEVER,** I do not want this to be an item you can find in a chest, like a flare to call the battlebus to drop in the player. It either has to be the result of a completion of a challenge or a 100% chance in a supply crate (would create more battles over crates) I do not want an item this powerful to be down to a roll of the dice.",FortNiteBR

Performance:

- Game Crashes after EVERY Game, no matter if PVE or BR after EVERY game, it freezes and i have to restart my PC.

- Screen freezes randomly (2-3 Sec) 

- FPS are about 20 FPS lower in regular and about 20-40 FPS lower in Tilted Towers.

Gameplay Issues:

- RPG (FUKEN RPG SHIT) like foreal, even if i box myself in i stell get a 110 Hit, dont know if its my Ping (usually around 20-50) but i can upload atleast 10 Clips where i got hit by a RPG wich was not even on my Body... and 110 Damage IS WAY TO FKN MUCH for something you NOT have to Aim with!

- Shotguns, srsly you cant do shit about some1 with SMG..

- The god damn random 16 Headshots with Pump, like srs, what am i supposed to do agains a 50 Bullet Tommy Gun spraying my Face when i have to wait 200 Secounds to shot the Pump again..

- Traps, like really sometimes you get hit, sometimes you are not even in the Trap and get hit, its aids!

- Random Teleports, really hella often when i peek, i only peak a little but then sometimes it teleports me and im almost falling out of my base cause its randomly teleporting me forward while peeking, WTF IS THIS?


,so im playing since End Season 1 (got up to lvl 30 in ss1) and the Game has never been THAT TRASH to play... Every enemy is spamming RPG,Clingers and SMG and that absolute no Fun to play anymore ...

I miss the old times in Season2 or 3 where it was actually playable with a good performance and Shotguns not being 100% Trash while SMG is the meta ...

- Bloom, the biggest factor making the M16/M4 (whatever it is for you) SHIT, like foreal there is like 4 out of 30 Shots connecting cause the Bloom is insalny Trash, thats nowhere near Skillbased playing its 100% Luck who gets the Luckier shots on Bloom ...


Well, enought things that Trigger me but time to say something god aswell, i LOVE the work they put in the Map but the Performance is lagging heavily.

The New Guns are pretty good and i love that they listen to the Community.

Something missing for me is like a nice AKM or something (Single Shot, Medium Damage AR) to use for Medium and Closer Range, or a AK-47 to use something other then the M16 wich is litterally shit if its not Blue.

Still loving the Game tho, just lost the motivation to play cause every Death is the same ... Save The World did really catch me but well, freezing after every mission ...

- Thanks for your time reading, would love to hear some other Feedback, Felix

I am always careful about temperatures and overheating and I always prefer to keep my machine around a healthy temperature especially under heavy load.

It's not something major for me but could be for someone else and still I would like to keep my machine healthy as for now is more prone to overheating.

Does anyone else get this?,"I'm a good player. That isn't me being vain or anything, because I know that this sub is filled with fantastic players. 

However, yesterday was undoubtedly my worst session of Fortnite \*ever\*. My building was off, my aim was lackluster, and my overall judgement of rotations etc was so, so poor. I've been playing since Day 1, and I can't remember a day when I've played so poorly.

I'm feeling pretty low as a result of this. I'm at work now dwelling on this. I get that it's just a game, but I'm really passionate about gaming, and I like to do well, but yesterday really was disappointing on my behalf.

I refuse to blame to spam meta on my performances as of late. I'm sure there are ways I can combat it. I'm just making the wrong calls. 

I found myself endlessly spamming solo games yesterday, trying to get a good run going, but I never seemed to get going. I typically land on the bus path in a named POI to try and catch other players as they rotate. I'm an aggressive player that wants to build and engage as to progress consistently, but yesterday it just wasn't happening for me. 

So, as per the title; does anyone else struggle with inconsistencies from time to time? Do you find yourself to be a good player \*but\* have sessions where it just doesn't go your way no matter what? I'm the type of person that gets slightly anxious and worries that they'll never progress, so it's reassuring to hear that I'm not alone.

Epic have been introducing things like the compact SMG and the tommy gun which shreds through buildings, and buffing explosives so that they destroy builds, and nerfed building so that it is exponentially easier for lesser skilled players to kill more experienced people. From a business standpoint, this means that Epic will get the newer players to stay and play their game, and eventually put money into Fortnite. But recently we have seen Epic trying to right their wrongs: they nerfed the compact smg and buffed structure’s starting health. We have to acknowledge that Epic is trying to please everyone: but that’s where they go wrong.:They CANT appeal to everybody. Its just a matter of choosing who is best to appeal to. If Epic wants to appeal to ‘the casual gamer,’ then so be it. I’m sure some of the dedicated gamers will stick around for a bit longer and try to fight for a more skill based game, but eventually most of them will be gone. It just isn’t fun to go against someone who is obviously a lot worse than you but still die to them because they just held the trigger for a few seconds on your building. Of course, you could counter that by saying that by saying that casual players wouldn’t find it fun to be destroyed by good players, but I’ll tell you what is fun: seeing improvement. There is nothing more rewarding than getting your first win after so many tries or finally learning that ramp rush after an hour in playground mode. And they, too will eventually find it boring to mow down all the builders with their tommy guns and Compact Smgs. Epic is trying to standardise winning for newer players; when really it should be a big achievement for them. If Epic made Fortnite more skill based, casual players would be forced to learn the game, and who knows? Maybe they could become a dedicated player.Lets be honest, all the casual players probably just play because everybody else they know play, and when they eventually get bored of it they’ll just move on to the next craze. Dedicated players are here to stay. They play because they genuinely like the game. These are the people that you should be catering to; They like Fortnite. They want it to stay alive for as long as possible. 

Sorry if this post was a bit long, I just wanted to get my point out there. Please note that this is in no way, shape or form hate speech against Epic games, fortnite or casual players. 

Share your thoughts with me; I’d like to know what you guys think about my opinion. Maybe if we get enough people to talk about it, then Epic will listen to us.",FortNiteBR

I've been playing Fortnite since around November last year, and I've somewhat enjoyed it. I had recently run into some financial and home hardships which restricted my ability to play fortnite. Now, thankfully as of around a week ago I have secured myself the necessary stuff to be able to play again, to not go in depth. I had discovered this the second I was able to play again, and I went through the support stuff. I had known about Epic's notoriety for having poor support, so here I am posting here to (hopefully) gather some attention.

The real kicker is the fact that I cannot find my stats on any website, which leads me to believe that my account was hijacked (an email would have been nice), name was changed (a confirmation email would have been nice), hacked on or something and banned (i think you know what i'm going to say here)

Now i'm pretty sure there is nothing that can be done, and the fact it is a free game I can just make another account (which I already have) would lead epic to just dismissing these requests, which I understand to a point. Though I do believe they should look into some requests.

Thank you.

All it is now is spray and pray now. All you've gotta do to win is hold down the trigger to win.

 Also, It seems like every update, they have some bug they need to fix or the new weapon is to OP.

In my opinion, this is what epic needs to do, to fix the game.
1. Bring back double shotgun. 
2. Vault the P90 and drum gun, or nerf it a whole lot. 
3. Reward better players. 
4. Add weapons that I'll actually use.

Another thing is that the new skins coming out haven't been as great as they used to be. I remember seeing something new in the shop in season 3/4 and immediately wanting to get it. Now, it's more like ""oh, a new skin, it looks good, but, not good enough to spend 20$ on.""
Not trying to sound like a cheapskate, but 20$ for a cosmetic is a little pricey.

I honestly don't know why I spent 6 months playing a game that will be die out to Bo4 and other games coming out this winter.

These are the reasons why I'm quitting. I'm going to go back to Counter Strike.

I see a lot of resistance to skill based match making on this sub and I'm sure why. I personally find it infuriating to make it to the final circles only to get trampled on by guys with 10+ kills. My squad averages about 3 kills a game. So we aren't terrible. We just don't have the time to play and practice like everyone else.

I get that some of you are probably really good and enjoy romping on bad players. Fortnite is great when you're winning, it sucks when you're losing. Why not let everyone get a taste of winning? Everyone wins, bad players enjoy the game more, good players get more enjoyment from beating other good players. Who disagrees?

No amount of ""just building lol"" and ""get gud"" is going to put me on the same level as people who play twice as much as I do. It's a game I want to have fun, I don't want to get demolished by some streamer every game.

It is pretty disheartening that those same streamers are essentially talking down on you if you are (1) not great at the game and/or (2) trying to actually get better. 

For a short while, it seemed like try-hard or sweaty was more for players that were being a nuisance and not actually employing a winning strategy (or attempting to get better at the strategy). Example being excessive building right at the edge of the storm well before the last circle taking pot shots at you, but evading your shots just long enough to weaken/kill you and then promptly die without mats as the storm collapses on them. However, it seems like it quickly devolved into a phrase for a player that didn't just roll out the red carpet and let the streamer kill him.

Will the New 7 week skin be a ""map changer"" like Last Season?","Carbine was the Good guy, Omega was the bad Guy.... Well... in the movie script that is. Same mechanics apply here to a point as well?

I've been wondering about this for a while, no one seems to have brought it up, hence no answer for it.  I googled, like any nerd would, what ragnarok means and it came up with this : 

Old Norse *Ragnarǫk,* equivalent to *ragna,* genitive of *regin* gods + *rǫk* fate, misread by someas *Ragnarökkr* literally, twilight of the gods; compare Götterdämmerung.

I looked up Drift, but went with the Kitsune he wears, and it is as follows :  

**Kitsune** (狐, キツネ, IPA: \[kitsɯne\] ( listen)) **is the** Japanese word for the fox. Foxes are a common subject of Japanese folklore; in English**, kitsu**ne refers to them in this context. Stories depict them as intelligent beings and as possessing paranormal abilities that increase with their age and wisdom.

As Drift levels, he ""gains"" more to his outfit, would that lead to him having his ""paranormal abilites"" grow to the point where he will have to fight with Ragnarok in order to seal the rifts and change everything back to the way it was?  

I guess this leads back to the week 7 skin... does it mean this skin will be the controller of time?  I guess If you read comics , you'll know what I mean if I mention ""The Watcher"".  

One more thing, It's weird that Uncle Pete's head is stone, like a roman god statue.  I wonder if this could mean the time watcher is none other than Janus, from roman mythology. 

In [ancient Roman religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome) and [myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology), **Janus** ([/ˈdʒeɪnəs/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English); [Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language): *IANVS* (*Iānus*), pronounced [\[ˈjaː.nus\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Latin)) is the [god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_deities) of beginnings, gates, transitions, time, duality, doorways,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus#cite_note-1) passages, and endings.

Also. That stupid bunker is still in wailing woods.  Don't think we haven't noticed Epic :\]

Go for early game fights

Or

Land in less populated areas

I already know these tips, and I do them all the time, why isn't it working for me?!

It's even worst when you see your favourite streamer and you want to be like them (I don't have any favourite streamers, just an example) but you die before you even get a gun.

A kill for me is like a win, even if it's a default skin

A win is like the world to me, even it was a 1v1 with a default skin

It is a replica, an idol, carved by humans in the past.*

As we've seen in this update, various items from our reality have appeared, such as Drift and the ATKs from the modern era. However, we've also received a Viking boat (790-1066), Easter Island heads (the fact that they're clean leads me to believe that they came from the 12^th century) and a variety of other time periods. My theory is that, whilst the cracks brought things from different time periods, it has also sent things to different time periods. In the case of Uncle Pete, he might have been sent back to the stone age, causing people at the time to believe that he was a god. In fear or admiration, they made idols of him, and one of them was sent back to the original Pete's location.",FortNiteBR

This LTM Features the following:

• 4 Teams of 25 Players
• 4 Small Safe Zones (The rest of the map is covered in storm dealing 10 dmg per second)

The safe zones are far apart and each team drops at one. Each team gets 3-5 minutes to loot. Each safe zone will then move to connect with the closest enemy safe zone (now the 4 circles become 2 and in each one there are 2 teams of 25 brawling) . The 2 teams get to fight for 4-5 minutes. The 2 circles then move again to merge into a final circle and the survivors fight until there is only 1 team standing.

I know this might have flaws but I am curious as to how good the general idea of this LTM is?

People are actually using all the guns in the game instead of just shotguns. Yeah there are guns that cause problems like the new submachine gun and sometimes the Drum Gun. However, I do think it's better that's you see people using a variety of weapons instead of everyone running around with shotguns. I use AR's, submachine guns, shotguns and sometimes even pistols depending on the situation. I have to choose what gun to use for the current fight instead of just ""oh I'm going to rush then with a shotgun"". The current meta allows for variety in gameplay instead of it just being a shotgun fest. No I'm not a ""new"" player. Been around since November. Those are just my thoughts.",FortNiteBR

Players: Fortnite Subreddit's Discussion Board,"***I want to preface this article by encouraging everyone reading to comment below their opinions to the problems shared in this article. None of my personal opinions will be presented in this post. Therefore, this article isn't made to bash anyone's opinions, but instead to weigh the diversity in them so that the community of this subreddit can change together as one.***

**I. Introduction:** Epic Games, clearly, is very ""reliant"" on /r/FortNiteBR. Speaking in a unbiased way, interacting with the community is a great, in fact excellent way to grow a community. Therefore, I believe a post organizing the different opinions of this community is necessary towards ensuring the state of Fortnite is suitable for all players.

**II. Recent Changes in Fortnite:** I will now list a series of Recent Changes made by Epic Games. ***Comment your responses to these changes and start a discussion!***

* **Double Shotguns:** Introduced in Season 5, there is now a cool-down timer that is displayed upon shooting your shotgun, indicating the time before you can shoot another. Thus removing the concept of Double Shotguns entirely from Fortnite.
* **Rifts:** Introduced in Season 5 as a part of the story-line, by stepping into a rift you can ""ride"" through the map of Fortnite with your glider.
* **All-Terrain Karts (ATKs):** Introduced in Season 5, ATKs are the latest vehicle in Fortnite Battle Royale, allowing players to ride through the terrain with their friends.
* **Compact SMG (P90):** With a high capacity and fast fire rate, the Compact SMG can do fast damage, and rip through player structures with ease. 
* **Double Barrel Shotgun (Break Barrel Shotgun):** Regarded as Season 5's ""new double pump,"" the break barrel can do high damage at extremely close range, maxing out at 187.5 at legendary varient.
* **Submachine Gun:** Introduced in Season 5 in replacement to the **Tactical SMG (Tec-9)**, the Tactical SMG is the third best shotgun next to the Drum Gun and Compact SMG.
* **Vending Machine Changes:** Introduced in v5.2, Vending Machines are now more likely to spawn Rare, Uncommon, Epic, and Legendary variants, with a decreased mat penalty for all 
* **Hip-Fire Accuracy Changes:** The new accuracy penalties to the Dual Pistols, Submachine Gun, and Hunting Rifles.
* **Trap Glitches:** Trap Hits not registering, or registering on opposite sides of walls. What do you think should happen to traps in the future of Fortnite?
* **Slurp Juice Changes:** The Slurp Juice has become more viable, now granting a max of 75 health or shields.
* **Heavy Sniper:** Introduced in Season 5, the new Heavy Sniper can break through terrain and player structures.
* **Minigun Headshot Multipler Changes:** 2.5x Multipler to 1.5x Multiplier.
* **Building Material Changes:** Wood wall starting health to 80 from 100. Stone wall starting health to 80 from 90. Wood wall max health to 150 from 200. Metal wall max health to 500 from 400. Metal build time to 25s from 20s.
* **Storm Circle:** Circle Times increased.
* **Pickaxe Changes:** Pickaxes do 75 health to player structures as opposed to 50.
* **SMG Nerfs:** Base Damage, Damage Dropoff, Structure Damage nerfs.

***What do you think should change? Did I miss anything? Would you like to see recaps like this for future seasons? Comment down below. I want a discussion!***",FortNiteBR

I'm sure they won't go bankrupt because someone no longer bought dab by accident cause they dropped their controller.

* After the idle animation starts, player 2 (enemy or ally) in a 1 tile radius can interact with player 1 by pressing the emote button
* After player 2 presses the emote button in a 1 tile radius, the flip animation starts, and player 1 flips player 2

Looking back on old threads caused me to think about the correlation between Fortnite and the Reddit Community.

Ever since I started playing games, I was always passionate about developers listening to their game's community, however, seeing what Reddit (or at least the majority of it) say about the Fortnite meta has caused me to change my mind. The constant backlash regarding the Double Shotguns in Fortnite from reddit completely ruined the game's meta. In fact, it's quite stale and boring. As you know, Fortnite has literally become a left click simulator, spray and pray--or in other words--who can hit the most shots with their drum while jumping. Of course, building is a direct counter play to this; however, 9/10 you will be dry out of mats due to the building nerfs provided by Epic. I believe Epic, in so intensely listening to the Reddit community, has led them to become confused, leading to each patch contradicting the previous.",FortNiteBR

Upgrading the servers would also be nice, since the game has such high traffic everyday, 30tick servers just aren't going to cut it anymore (I notice increases at the peak times of the day, almost a 50ms increase consistently) so an upgrade to 64 or even 128 tick would help, I know Epic has the funds to make it happen.

Everything is from season 1 nothing from past season 1 no weapons from past it no bufs or nerfs that was implemented after season 1. There is the old map with salty and tomato town and I think dusty not named in the game. All weapons are how they used to be with the pumps grey and the tacs purple. Double pump is a thing and no tilted towers. Also the old music is Back when you get a victory royale. 

This will show everyone how fortnite has changed and bring back the season 1 days for the people that miss it. 

The game mode should be squads or solo and should last for at least 3 weeks this will make people who used to solo squad able to solo squad with the double pump and for people that haven't played season 1 experienced what their friends experienced in season 1 or what YouTubers and streamers exepinced.

I grinded for days on end. During the first week of season 3 i got 15 wins in less than 16 hours. however, that was back when the game required skill and a good understanding of how game mechanics worked. I loved this game so much until season 4, that was where the game went downhill (for me at least). I couldn't stand the hop rocks, I felt that it lowered the skill gap between people that could build structures and people that couldn't, but that skill gap has been lowered by a greater degree since then with the addition of the compact smg, heavy sniper and building nerf.

Hear me out, many people are going to rip on me for hating the compact smg, I understand they've nerfed it but i still hate it, my builds get wiped within less than a second of being placed. I adapted to this game's building mechanics and how to eliminate my opponents utilizing said mechanics. But now Epic is trying to stop people from building so this game is more appealing to new players. Which is terrible, they are spoonfeeding these noobs with overpowered weapons and changes to help them against enemies that have an understanding of building. So rather then changing the game back to how it felt back then, why not give players the choice of how they play?

Rework the matchmaking system so that both new and old players can be happy (sort of how Call of Duty has the core and hardcore variations), Epic please consider the following points;
**For the ""casual"" matchmaking system:**
*Leave game settings the way they currently are.
*Make this system the automatic default one so new players dont stray to the advanced one.
*OR lock the advanced system and make 2 hours playtime on the casual system a requirement to unlock it
*Make LTM's apart of the casual system only because good players only play new LTM's once then they go back to the standard modes.

**For the ""advanced"" matchmaking system:**
*Revert shotguns to season 2 settings (no shot cooldown, no long pump equip animation).
*Remove the compact smg, stink bombs, clingers.
*REMOVE BLOOM, ADVANCED PLAYERS DONT NEED A LUCK BASED WEAPON MECHANIC.

Epic, if you make this game more skill based it allows more opportunities for this game to be mainstream E-Sports material. Having professional players compete at high stake events such as E-Sports tournaments is far more profitable than gently introducing a 12 year old to the game and draining his mum's (I'm Australian, sorry...) credit card balance. I want this game to return to the state that it was when I first got into it, because the grind was what made me continue to play for hours everyday. Always trying to get better at aiming &amp; building and do better plays than my friends was something that no other game has ever given me in my many years of being a basement dweller.

I understand this post is lengthy and probably going to get deleted but if you agree with most or all points I've made please spread the word, because I believe that this new matchmaking concept could be what the entire Fortnite community wants. If this gets enough support I'll release concept art for the new gamemode menu and playlist descriptions. Thanks for reading, please leave your feedback because I want to know what you guys think of my idea, laters.",FortNiteBR

Do you want to cheese your way to easy wins without actually being good enough to kill people? Fear not, I have cracked the code and the secret is Sniper Shootout.


You see, it's very very easy to cheese wins in this mode. Let me show you how.


To start with, never land near anyone else. Ever. You land as far away from that bus as possible (but preferably near an ATK/Rift). When you land, you just have two jobs:
1: Farm as many mats as you possibly can.
2: Get as many heals as you possibly can.


I'm guessing you can all see where I'm going with this. Yes, we are going to heal our way to easy wins. You see, the problem with trying this out in the normal mode is that people can both murder you and plow down anything you build while you try to stall.


In Sniper Shootout, people both:
A: Can't aim.
B: Can't shoot down anything fast enough.


After you've gotten a ridiculous amount of mats and heals, I'd personally advice you hang out for a while. Maybe reacquaint yourself with your friendly neighborhood bush (just make sure you're completely hidden in it, if someone sees you and they're not a bot you're pretty dead.)


The most dangerous parts of your life will obviously come when you're running from one circle to the next. Fear not! This is Sniper Shootout and your materials make you untouchable. Build your way to safety. If someone starts chasing you, who cares? Just keep building. Give that guy a nice workout. If 2 or 3 people start chasing you, well, more the merrier right?


I'd advise you spam everywhere with buildings then sneak down to hang out in a random crevice for a while. Remember, unless someone gets really lucky, they'll need more than one shot. If they need more than one shot, you'll have a wall before they shoot again. So relax! Maybe do a few emotes while you're running, I don't know.


The last circle shouldn't really be that hard. Just spam build a 1x1 as fast as you can as the last guy hopelessly looks on. Again, maybe show him a nice 'make it rain' emote over the corner. Since you're playing to win by healing, you probably have a lot more heals than the last guy, so it really should be an easy win.


**Notes:**
*If you're going to win with a medkit and you don't have a slurp juice, just make sure you take a couple points in damage from one of the earlier storms. That way, you can start healing before the storm fully closes in, making sure you get off that medkit.
*Cancel the last tip if you have a campfire. At that point, maybe watch something on Netflix while you wait? I heard Bo Burnham is really popular nowadays.
*Most of the time it won't even come to the last circle. Usually the last guy finds a creative way to kill himself beforehand.
*For those extra sweats, there is one way you can cheese them. Bait them into chasing after your 1v1 then impulse them off the top when you're high enough. Dab emote recommended.

**TL;DR** Dude just win every game with a heal off. There is literally no weakness to this strat in Sniper Shootout.

Explosives are also very annoying but traps not working and lag spikes mid game are the reasons I'm on the brink of quitting the game. If the game doesn't change to what the fan base wants COD IIII and battlefield V will take the players away from fortnite just like how fortnite took PUBGs players.

I'm not hating on the devs I'm just making a suggestion and to be honest I doubt fortnite would die off like PUBG because the devs are amazing.

Now with the amount of time left in this season and with the current pace of the trucks Dusty Depot seems like the most likely destination unless Epic is trolling us and the trucks go all the way around the divot and end up back at the old factories which would be totally awesome but it doesn't make sense why they would go all the way around for no apparent reason. If you take a look at the trucks then you can see that they are carrying building supplies and since in the past buildings have gotten updated and there are always a lot of little changes to the map during the season it seems very likely that Dusty Depot is getting a makeover. Now as you know when the meteor hit it completely destroyed one of the 3 buildings there and left the middle one all mangled and ruined. If this is true then it is unclear whether the other one will be built back up and the middle one will be repaired, or if the middle one will just be repaired and that is it.

I will warn you that this building method is very situational, for example the ground needs to be relatively flat so if you are fighting someone in the streets of tilted towers for example, it would be a good time to try out this strategy. However just because this strategy is situational it does not mean that is useless. Take the bounce pads for example, they are often used for mobility in fights but not for much else, and yet they are still very useful and you see pro gamers using them all the time.

Right before season 5 they introduced a new back-bling into the files. The back-bling in question was some sort of a king/knight shield backbling.

Now we have the road trip skin, if you look closely at it it has a metallic look. Looks to be made of a strong material (could possibly be armor as it could be a king skin because we haven't seen one yet).

https://i.redd.it/dnz6kz2g0zg11.png

Now if you take a close look at the flowerish logo on the shield it is called the Fleur-de-lis which is a french/frankish logo, now if you have watched Vikings \[the show vikings\] or read a little bit of history, they are involved with the franks. I think this is a king skin to combat the skin Ragnarok as shown in the battle pass.

Scoring systems are confusing to viewers and anticlimactic. **Any tournament format that doesn't make winning, as defined by the game, the #1 priority is confusing to viewers and feels wrong as a competitive format.**


I think that camping is a healthy and inevitable part of fortnites metagame no matter what you change short of removing building.  The changes to the end game circle (it now moving) was almost the only change needed.  The action and strategy created by many turtling players fighting for better position in the maelstrom of low mid and highground during these circle movements is suspenseful and fun to both play and watch in my opinion.

The biggest problem I see is that it's often very hard or impossible to loot kills that aren't directly next to you and that makes going for them not worth the risk.  Additionally theres no guaruntee that these players will have anything of value left once you kill them.  Because of these reasons this is my proposed overhaul of the looting system in fortnite.


All of this will happen when a player is fully eliminated:


1.  30% of their wood brick and metal will be instantly added to yours.


2.  30% of their ammo (excluding rockets) will be instantly added to yours.


3.  1 Champion's Chalice will be added to your inventory (or dropped at your location if inventory is full) the Champion's Chalice is just a buffed slurp that heals for 100, has a .5 second drink time, and doesn't stack. The massive amount of total healing added to the game by this change will reduce variance (making the better player win more often) and reward aggressive players both in public games and competitive events.  It will make 3rd partying weaker by providing a large quick to cast heal (but still over time) to the victor of a fight if you can close it out quickly.



All weapons, items, traps, and remaining mats/ammo will drop to the ground at the eliminated players location as normal.

I know these changes seem a bit strange but once again the ultimate goal is to make eliminating players worth the effort and not just something you do because camping is boring or because epic said that you have to in order to win money.  ",FortNiteBR

I did not make the post because I was salty about losing. I didn’t do it because I’m new and can’t build. I did it because I don’t think you need to be a pro builder to succeed. A common argument I got was “shoot their building down”. That’s a bit difficult if you have 6 different buildings surrounding you in .4 seconds due to someone being god tier at building. I have been playing since season 2 and am a decent builder. I don’t want to just instantly get this post deleted as well, so just take what I said into consideration. 
TL;DR: I don’t think you should need to be a god at building to succeed.",FortNiteBR

It would be great if they changed the challenges for the season 4 progressive outfits to xp instead of levels and brought them back for anyone with unfinished stages for carbide and omega. The challenges for carbide would require the same amount of xp needed for the different styles for drift and the challenges for omega would require the same amount of xp needed for the different styles for ragnarok.

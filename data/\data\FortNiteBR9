With the latest two patches the lobby and ingame is at the point where it’s not playable anymore. My rig is my little treasure (i7 8700k with RTX 2080) and it is more then frustrating to keep occupied with performance issues. I capped my FPS to 163 (Monitor refresh rate 165Hz) so I play the game on 1440p because why not the rig easily handles this resolution with over 230 FPS and I’m old otherwise I can’t see shit :) ... Switched to 1920/1080 on 163 FPS still massive drops and stutters. Temp (60 Celsius/140 Fahrenheit) and workload (30-50% no problem with 6 cores).

Can someone explain to me what the hell is happening? What is causing these problems? I mean bad performance optimizations is the biggest issue but this bad? The drops go down to 10-50 FPS!! It’s crazy.

Sorry for the long post. I hope some hero found a solution and would share it with me.

Cheers,

Dom",FortNiteBR

Also controller players can spam there aim assist and it works THROUGH the corn. So you can be on the outside of the corn getting layered by someone who doesn’t even see you.

The corn can also cause audio bugs still. Remember the constant particle effect you would get after walking through to corn field when it first came out? You can still get the Audio effect of it constantly after walking thigh it once, no matter what you do.

• It is literally a silenced RPG with the range of a sniper
• It does the same damage as a BODY shot from a silenced sniper without actually having to hit your shot but the ground next to your enemy
• It reloads a full second faster than the silenced sniper 
• It uses shotgun ammo which is fairly common and encourages spamming
• If you get it on your first chest, everybody is one shot without shield and you have to just hit the ground below them to kill them
• You can have the bow fully charged and jump around and walk around which makes it much easier to use than a sniper
• There is a given trajectory of the arrow so you don't have to use your leading skills required for snipers
• Why would you use a sniper if you can just hit next to your enemy's feet and do the same damage?

As you can see, the Boom Bow in it's current stage is highly unbalanced and I am baffled it is still not nerfed heavily. It takes very less skill and rewards Hugh damage.

One proposed change would be to make splash damage to 65, without changing the body and headshot impact damage.",FortNiteBR

But that being said - I didn't like double pump but I would likely sacrifice what we currently have for it. I'd add the QoL (such as building options, etc etc) but I'd likely have the items as they were and implement new ideas in different game modes.

- The loot pool is at it’s worst state. Shield and shotguns are so rare at the moment. This should be top priority to fix.

- The rate of farming. Fortnite without building is essentially a bad shooter BR game and we experience this every single start game. Mid game depends on your luck and how willing you are to spend 5-10 minutes solely farming. 

Why would Epic make a game where it is so RARE to get good gameplay? I feel lucky if I find myself a shotgun and shield. The game is very frustrating at the moment, and you can tell the same frustration runs through the pro scene players.",FortNiteBR

You have to pay MONEY to access the least played gamemode. The game has gone through all its seasons and crap with heavy micro-transactions and it's NOT EVEN OUT OF EARLY ACCESS.

""Matchmaking"" doesn't exist. New player? Yeah well fuck you, bucko. We gonna toss you in with people who have HOURS more experience than you.

Weapons feel clunky and unbalanced. It's hard enough to fucking snipe someone when the projectile moves slow as ass. And then that John Wick comes out of nowhere and his bullet basically goes into warp drive through your ass cheeks.

The game heavily promotes wild and cocky plays. You gotta go out there and harness your wild fuckin' gunslinger all while playing slow and cautious like you SHOULD in a PvP MP game is boring and doesn't pay off well at all.

This game is just a fucking unbalanced pile of rat shit that someone decided to pick up and polish like a fucking crowned jewel.

The fact that it tosses newer players in with more experienced players makes you feel DISCOURAGED. You spend all that time gearing up and keeping your head down like you SHOULD only for some wild, 300+ hours hot shot to fucking drop in from nowhere and gun you down like he was born to do it.",FortNiteBR

For example if a player has 30-40 ping he should be able to perform the same as a 1 ping player. Basically, there would be a server delay for the 1 ping player in order to perform actions at the same rate as the 30-40 ping player. An ""average"" ping value from some kind of giant data set should be considered for the base responsiveness of the servers with regards to turbo building.

It could have been a great vaulting choice.

Instead it was quite a bad decision. Tactical Shotguns were still bad and Combat Shotguns were in my opinion fine, but the spawn rate needs to be fixed. They didn't unvault the Heavy Shotgun (yet, I still have hope), everyone is still begging for it. The Drum Gun was unvaulted around the same time as well so that really didn't work well. 

The vaulting of the Pump Shotgun could have been an awesome decision to bring a more diverse weapon selection and meta. Instead it was poorly executed due to other decisions made by Epic.",FortNiteBR

As of late fortnite for Nintendo switch has been performing very bad. The game does not run at a consistent rate and there is always massive fps drops throughout the game. This has gone on for far too long and epic needs to fix this. I suggest that for nintendo switch we get an option to switch our graphics to mobile graphics, this would dramatically boost our fps and make the game as a whole more enjoyable to more serious players.

Noobs running across a field aimlessly, small build fights, my first two wins in a row. I get a nostalgic feeling of all these things and playing with friends and making new ones. I think of fun. Which is the opposite of what I think now.

 Lately, I've been falling off with Fortnite, and it's community. It just feels so wrong now. Between unbalanced weapons, awful teammates, sweats, and Fortnite drama it just isn't the same. When they added syphon I was so happy, it was exciting and fun. Everything felt balanced around that time. And they remove it. 

The more I try to hold on to the game, get better, level up, and finish the Battlepass hurts. It just isn't fun. I'm taking this game way too seriously and don't know how to fix it.

It also doesn't help all of my old friends are leaving me for other games and things, or people. 

(If you guys want the backstory to why I feel nervous in gamechat, comment)

I truly miss when the game was simple. Just grass, a few buildings, only about 15 or less weapons. I remember when I saw a team of Black Knights me and my friends would shake in out boots. 

If you read all of this, and want other reasons I fell out, tell me. Also, (Don't bully my gamertag, at the time I was cringe)

The only thing that's not RNG is builds. Like what if there was 1 build button that would randomly give a floor, a ramp, a pyramid, or a wall? That would seem pretty weird right. And FSA helps but it's not 100% accurate. It's better with higher tier weapons but not 100%. It's evident watching any pro streamer. Sometimes you get a good slot machine pull and luck is on your side and sometimes you don't. So it's not a slot machine like lootboxes. Not anything that terrible. And being skilled can help you but sometimes even pros die off spawn repeatedly. It's fun for sure. Slot machines are fun too. I feel like the only way it could be a true esport is 1v1s with a limited non OP weapon pool to choose from for ideal loadouts. Think Mortal Kombat but with Fortnite. Because right now, engaging in a buildfight means two things, snipers looking at you and slipstream or otherwise 3rd parties. Competitive 1v1s would be entirely based on mechanical skill. Don't get me wrong. I'm happy to play the slots with battle royale most days but I don't see how it could be a sport. If esports go into the olympics fortnite would not be on the list of games for that for sure. I'm fine with fortnite not being an esport and just being a fun roll of the dice. Most of my favorite games aren't anything like an esport. But it seems like it wants to be an esport. Idk. Just a thought I had when tap firing a gold tactical AR at a player 20 -30m away standing still and not hitting one shot then getting boom bowed by them. Funny how effective the boom bow is without slot machine bloom. But that's battle royale in a nutshell. Even look at the movies Battle Royale and Hunger Games. Is it the most skilled highly trained people that come out on top in those movies? No not at all. Do you see fortnite as being more competitive than something like Overwatch? I actually don't play Overwatch precisely because of how competitive it is. But Overwatch has lootboxes which are...slot machines....wtf.

So you know. You're just hopping on a game of fortnite. Just casual solos. Dancing with a gang of people in the pre game lobby. Just having some fun you know. But then ohdamn. That one guy who wants to show everyone that he is an OG. So there was a renegade raider with a black knight shield and the notorious 900db reaper axe. He was flossing and doing other og emotes, just to show off that he's an og. And he was litterally swinging his 900db loud axe for no reason. I mean i can see you're an og chill tf down kid. He was trying to lure people of the gang of people that were dancing to him with his ogness. And the most beautifull thing of all: no-one came to dance or to do something with him.

And i am not saying that you cannot use an og cosmetic, but just the showing off part makes it cancerous.

Long story short/ TLDR: it is june 2019 atm and of you're still trying to show everyone that you're og and want to be the cool kid, you really need to get a life.",FortNiteBR

Idk if it’s the meta or what not but I just got tired of having to carry a combat. It’s not even that either. Unless I’m playing with friends, I find it hard to enjoy the game anymore. There’s nothing to grind for but battle pass skins but those are pretty guaranteed. Nothing else. I’ve lost great a great friend of mine recently because he was frustrated with the game and now I see why. I’m losing more and more friends who enjoyed the game with me. Now, I guess it’s my turn. It’s sad. I spent over $3k - $5k on this game and honestly it was the only thing keeping me involved. But now I’m lost. I feel like my voice isn’t listened to and from what I see, a majority of dedicated players aren’t being listened to either. I’m tired of a company neglecting players who genuinely care about the game and grew with it. I’m seeing Epic turn into EA and it feels like it’s too late for change. I’ve lost hope time and time again thinking maybe one day they’ll hear our voice. But today just made me realize, I’m no longer enjoying what I loved so much. Maybe one day they’ll change. We can only hope. But for now, good luck to all the players who love the game, maybe one day they’ll see what they’re doing. Good luck to the “pros” because honestly, competitive is a joke, we all know that. Good luck to the casuals, idk if you genuinely love the game like I do, but if you do, you’ll see what they’re doing. Goodbye, for now.

The tac is by far the most inconsistent gun in the game, I can hit someone from the same distance same ADS and I still someone get different numbers...fix this damn gun. I'm tired of constantly using a gray tac til about the 3rd circle when I either get one from a airdrop or I kill someone with one.

All I want to do is get better at this game man and all everyone does is run away as much as possible once they realize im actually putting effort into the fight, resulting in 15 min of me traversing the map chasing people when I would like to actually be getting better at the game.

I cant be the only one that finds this type of play style old?? People just running away hoping you stop chasing them or they find a huge battle to commit suicide in. Thats literally been all my games lately.. like I understand that there were planes and mobility stuff like that in the previous seasons, but theres just something about this slip stream man and promoting people to just perpetually run away when the fight is lost.

I contacted Epic Support and they responded with an email asking for my display name, what platforms I played on, etc. I responded with the necessary info. and then they sent me another email saying that they located my account but want to make sure I'm the original owner.

The email asked for things like my IP address, an invoice ID from a purchase I made, when the last time I logged onto my account was, and the last 4 digits of the credit card or other payment used to make purchases were.

The things they were asking for looked very suspicious, it's weird because I contacted them on the official website, but I just wanted to make sure.

Below I've put a picture, any help is greatly appreciated, thanks in advance!

The Revolver has been secretly changed during Season 9 with the fire rate and reload time changed.

My idea is for the Revolver to have Epic and Legendary variants of the weapon. All of the Revolvers use Medium Bullets.

REVOLVER RARITIES:

**Common Revolver**

Damage: 54

Fire Rate: 1.5

Reload Time: 2.2

Magazine Size: 6

**Uncommon Revolver**

Damage: 57

Fire Rate: 1.5

Reload Time: 2.1

Magazine Size: 6

**Rare Revolver**

Damage: 60

Fire Rate: 1.5

Reload Time: 2.0

Magazine Size: 6

**Epic Revolver**

Damage: 63

Fire Rate: 1.5

Reload Time: 1.9

Magazine Size: 6

**Legendary Revolver**

Damage: 66

Fire Rate: 1.5

Reload Time: 1.8

Magazine Size: 6

&amp;#x200B;

TEXTURES:

The Epic and Legendary variants would look like the Judge Handcannon from Fortnite Save the World:

 

[Epic\/Legendary Revolver](https://i.redd.it/0vzpc0wa1d331.png)

One new change for all Revolvers would be that there is no damage fall off for this weapon. Another change might be the Headshot multiplier from x2.0 to x1.85 to avoid overpowered damage. They would also have the same zoom in function that the Infantry Rifles have.

If this idea is accepted, I suggest vaulting the Hand Cannon because the weapon is way to rare to find now.

DROP RATES:

There would also be some drop rate changes to match up the current meta. NOTE: Drop rates based off of all weapons!

***Floor Loot***

Common - 4.15%

Uncommon - 1.01%

Rare - 0.51%

Epic - 0.21%

Legendary - 0.09%

***Chest Loot***

Common - 5.81%

Uncommon - 2.67%

Rare - 2.17%

Epic - 1.87%

Legendary - 1.75%

***Supply Drop Loot***

Legendary Revolver - 15%

SOUND FILES:

The Epic and Legendary variants of the Revolver will use the sound files for the Scoped Revolver

The Switch and Mobile versions would also get updated sounds for the current Revolvers

&amp;#x200B;

This is just a suggestion, but feel free to show Epic Games this idea, as I think it could help the future of Fortnite Battle Royale.

I primarily play solos, I play with friends, I love the game, but I hate the state that it's in. I do think that catering to casuals is the worse move, but everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Fortnite has been what I've been playing since season 1 was about to end. I love the game to death, I've supported them through thick and thin, but I personally think that catering to the pros is the right thing to do in this situation. My reasoning for this is that most of my friends are casual players. And most of them hated when siphon was removed, hated when the pump was vaulted, and loved when the skill gap was high because it forced them to improve. I understand that the common argument is that people just get too sweaty and W key all game, but losing was always the best way to improve. With this current meta, I feel like no one will be able to improve. My friends will continue to always lose to me in 1v1's, and I'm going to keep pub-stomping because none of the casuals and new players will be able to experience the more skill based Fortnite of seasons 2, 3, and 4. I want what's best for the game, and this is what I think will help the most. Unvault the pump, suppressed smg, burst rifles, and the hunting rifle. Either nerf or vault boom bows, drum guns,  storm flips, and all explosives in general. Make the spawn rate of the combat shotgun higher, make all shotguns do a little less damage (Keep the tac damage, combats go down to 70, 73, 76, and pumps go to 90, 95, 100, 105), and do more community based events like the unvaulting event, letting Epic know which weapons and items the community wants to either come back to the game, or get removed outright. Please, let me know your opinions so that me can communicate and see if there is any common ground, because I really do care about this game, and I want to hear and or see other's responses to this.",FortNiteBR

I was watching couple of videos on YT today about the state of Fortnite right now. Man, I guess no one likes casual players. Listen, I am a casual player and I want to make some things clear to all the pros/gods in this game.

1. Stop thinking that We want the exact opposite of what pros want. We were mad after syphon was removed. We also press F to pay respect to pumps.
2. Stop saying that Epic is taking decisions to favor us. They are dumb and we are not responsible for that. We never said to reduce harvesting rate. We never said to add burst smg.
3. You think the spray and pray meta will favor us? If I cant aim a single bullet, what will 50 bullet clip do to the opponent with a combat shotgun?
4. You spend 10 hrs a day on Fortnite, we spend 1. We know that, and we respect that. We never said we should win against you. Its Epic who introduced ballers in Arena, we never asked for it. And guess what, did we qualify for world cup. NO. Some cheaters did.
5. The meta changes every week. You guys have patience to adapt. Do we? NO. We don't want a new meta every week. We are happy with anything that we can adapt to at our own pace.
6. We form the vast majority of the playerbase, yet who gets to tweet anything to Fortnite? You guys. We only have reddit honestly. Most of the casuals are not even here.

If you still want to make YT videos blaming us for Epic's decisions, **you are dumb.**",FortNiteBR

Millions of people play this game, but the players get put into 2 categories; casual, and competitive. 

Casual players are people that come and go bouncing through different games. I’ve heard many complaints form casual players saying this game is getting to difficult to win, so they leave the game behind and move on. Although they might come back for a major event that gets spread throughout the internet or a new season they may only play a couple of games and leave it behind. 

Competitive players play this game for a living they may spend 8+ hours playing this game for the many or the fame. With the World Cup the competitive players have been practicing and I’ve heard some say they will quit afterwards.  The competitive players want to make this game fair like; raise combat shotguns spawn rate or nerf ballers or maybe they just want to see something else in the game.  

What both kinds of players are asking for is either to make the game fun again or make it fair. A person who plays the game 1 hour a day has the same chance of winning as a player who plays 8+ hours. This is causing the game to decline in numbers. What you people don’t realize is you are asking for too much. Epic Games has a staff of 1000 members trying to help millions of people. Does anyone realize how hard this is for every single person working. Try putting yourself in their shoes for once",FortNiteBR

I told the idea to my friends and they liked it but at the time I didnt had a reddit account to share my idea in this subreddit.

My idea was to make a game mode exactly as normal solos just with a twist, there would me NO healing.
This means there wouldnt be bandages, med kits, mini shields, shields, slurp juices or neither chug jugs.

The reason this game mode would be amazing is because every match would last for 10-15 minutes maximum and it would be even better if the storm shrinks faster or the circle is smaller.

I hope you liked my idea for a new game mode and if you did please help me get it noticed so we can make it happen at least for a week. Thank you!",FortNiteBR

What the hell?  Why?

We get credit for knockdowns and eliminations due to fall damage that we cause, so clearly there's a mechanism in the game that keeps track of that.  But not when it's a team-kill, which means that you can't report it...  Why?  It happens multiple times in every game of big-team modes and it's the most annoying shit in the game.  You already have to loot for 5 minutes and run for 3 minutes before anything happens in these modes.  So if I get team-killed one more goddamn time by some dumbshit 8-year-old who does the ""Take The L"" dance for 2 straight minutes over my shambling corpse, I'm gonna lose my marbles.

I'm not saying that rare skins are all ugly skins but just that players with them get this undeserved praise which tends to make them become egomaniacs. I'm sick of seeing people who can only use ""rare"" skins. Personally whatever skin that looks dope to me I'll use, the price and rarity doesn't matter to me. Admittedly it is cool using skins people don't usually have or maybe even like but I don't see myself as better than maybe a Raven or Shadow Ops skin just because they're more common than a Skull Trooper. Personally find that skin to be pretty ugly looking, just looks like a kids Halloween costume to me (the scythe though is rad asf.)

Calm your ego guys, it's just a game. If you have a rare skin that's dope. It can show you're maybe an OG and probably have skill. But I'm not gonna be impressed until I see that skill in battle

i play fortnite quite a lot - what i usually do is verify the game before launch, and then set the priority on the game to high.

regardless of this, i still get frames that stutter and lock up. at random points too, i'll just be walking on a certain part of the map and i'll drop from nearly 60 frames to 2 frames for 15 or so seconds. sometimes it even happens in fights, i'll have no chance to win with such shitty frames. needless to say, this pisses me off a lot of the time.

i have the game settings at the lowest possible. i hit auto and it turns everything down. i don't cap my frames - they're at unlimited. if you want more specifics i'd be more than happy to provide them.

i play on a shitty laptop with 6gb of ram and a Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600 for the graphics card. ive also made sure all of my drivers are updated (device manager -&gt; right click -&gt; update driver software -&gt; search online -&gt; your driver is up to date).

I've been screwing around with it for a whole day now, and I still keep dying to randoms. For example, I died to a guy that was literally sneaking up on me while I was looting some guy's stuff, and despite me seeing him and surprising him with the drum gun, I still died. Now, I'm pretty sure it was bloom since half my shots didn't hit and I was aiming neck-area, but you can't really blame that because clearly Epic doesn't wanna do anything about it *cough*. 

Anyway, I've been bouncing around X: 8/7 Y: 7/6. I like to keep my Y one point lower as it makes it easier to control for me. However, I'm still missing, and I can't hip fire whatsoever. Thing is, I've been hearing that in order to be good at building, you have to have a higher sensitivity. For building, 7 seems too slow, while 8 seems a little too fast. Since I've been playing R6 Siege a good bit recently, I'm still surprised that with this much support, Epic really couldn't even add fine tuning sensitivity. As for gun fights, 7 seems better than 8, which is just a little too fast. I still can't flick shoot like other players and I'm incredibly frustrated tbh. 

So, I'm looking for some tips on the matter; sensitivity tips and where to start getting better at aiming as a whole. Any info would be appreciated.",FortNiteBR

This boils down to the fact that you can repeatedly get caught in a stalemate situation where you're repeatedly downing the same enemies, whilst their team are covering fire and picking up their downed team member. Especially in squads, due to the fact everyone in the team will often be using a slot for meds/shields, their teammate can be replenished to full health, with no consequences for their mistakes. 

Obviously there are criticisms to be made about the attacking teams plays; for example picking the wrong fight, or spamming the enemy to prevent the revive whilst team members push and so on, but if somebody has been downed 5 times in a game and get downed once more, do they really deserve the full 100/50 seconds of time in a ""knocked"" status, before they die fully?

From reading this, you can probably anticipate the topic of the next paragraph, as this mechanic is employed in other BR games, and for good reason. If downed players were to take more severe increments of damage, in relation to the number of times they were downed, it would punish this turtled style of gameplay, and allow players to apply pressure and make an opening to push by downing players multiple times if they were to be revived successfully, instead of an opening being created when either team runs out of materials to replace the spammed parts of their structures.

An example of increments in downed damage could go as follows;

1st time downed: 1 dmg/s (100 seconds of downed time)
2nd time downed: 2 dmg/s (50 seconds of downed time)
3rd time downed:  5 dmg/s (20 seconds of downed time)
4th+ time downed: 10 dmg/s (10 seconds of downed time)

Something like this wouldn't negatively effect general gameplay, it'd just require greater team play to revive a comrade who'd been downed multiple times previously.",FortNiteBR

I was someone that had the battlepass during season 2, I got with about 30 days left, and I worked my way up to like tier 40 or 50. (Didn't play that much back then) I was really upset I didn't have enough time to get the black knight and now is such a rare skin and I would wear it all the time now if I could.

But what if Epic could do a special event where if you had season 3 or season 2 or maybe season 4 if its over, you choose which season you want to work on and you get 10-20 days to complete it, if you don't complete it, oh well. You would have to have played during those season though, you can't just join season 4 and be able to choose season 2 battlepass, that would be unfair. I would love it if Epic did this because I could finally get Black Knight. This would be a one time thing and you wont be able to do anything else after this, you can't pop in and choose at any time it would be a specific certain date(s). 

I understand that this has a really low chance of happening but it would be cool if Epic heard me out thanks for reading.",FortNiteBR

The game is kind of getting stale at this point as a veteran player that has over 200 wins it is hard for me to feel the need to keep winning because there really isn't anything that I get out of it anymore. 

Do you remember grinding for your first win? How much adrenaline you would get being in the final 5 finally trying to come out on top? 

Now after winning several games I just don't feel anything at all and I cannot play this game for longer than a few matches straight all because I really have no incentive at all.

All that being said, I feel like is time to add some sort of ranked mode like in other big games like: Bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, etc.. or at the very least implement some sort of victory token system where you can shop for special cosmetics with only that currency. Adding something like this would really create more of a reason to keep playing this game and would please a lot of veteran players like myself.",FortNiteBR

Any good suggestions would be appreciated. 

*Hide and Seek* 
In this game, one player hides anywhere on the map. The hidden player then has to give one character from their coordinates.(example D from D4). After one minute has passed the hiding player must fire their weapon. Every 3 minutes the hiding player can ask one of the others for their coordinates and tell them how many square away they are. The person who finds the hidden player then picks the next player to hide, which are then executed by firing squad. 

*Cart Racing*
All players work together to build a race track. They can incorporate jumps, ramps and really anything they can come up with. At the end of the track, each player will place a spike trap in a narrow hallway. First player dead wins.

* I’ll try add other good suggestions.*",FortNiteBR

I am currently level 62 and the amount of hours I would need to play and XP I would need to earn before the season ends is unrealistic to unlock the full thing. I think it is pretty dumb how I purchased the battle pass for a skin but when I DO finally get it, it basically tells me I needed to grind this season. Wish I knew that at the start of the season.

You have to remember, there are multiple facets to being a good player. Ideally, you have to build, manage your inventory wisely, have an actual strategy, &amp; your landing. 

But, I don't even have to go into that. Disproving the people who say there isn't a skill gap is easy as pie. You have been playing since day one, 600 wins &amp; all that. You match with a noob. Noob; as in, crouching in the open with their pick out at all times &amp; trying to shotgun snipe. If there was not a skill gap, you  would actually feel challenged against that chad. But, obviously, because there is a skill gap, you never will.

Evidence:
When you spawn into a game you are zapped into the match by that thing above your head and when you die you’re zapped out. 

So then the crack in the sky is the players in the simulation trying to escape. 

The visitor is a real person that is trying to see what’s going on in the simulation. 

These were just random thoughts so I’m not saying these are 100% fact. 

Reply with anything that could prove this wrong or more stuff to add on.

It also appeared once or twice times a warning saying ""you can't play on this platform"", I think it was that. I already tried like 40 times to enter the game but it won't let me in. I acctually manage to enter the game like 5 times, in one of them I manege to play 1 entire solo match(I won that's why I am saying "" 1 entire solo match""), and on the other times that I managed to enter the game, I entered in some solo matches and then the warning kept appearing. I need help, I already search about this and i didn't find anything relevant. I love this game and I want to play it whit my friends. Any help is welcome.
I think this problem is kinda unfair to get, not onlu unfair for myself but for the others.
Thank's for your time.
PS:Yes I already spent a bit of money on Fortnite.
And I forgot to mention on one of the times that I managed to enter the game there was a bug that was ""displaying""that I was on level 1(I'm on level 63).
Once again thank's for your time.",FortNiteBR

For the revolver, imagine it was like a rapid action style gun where each trigger press forced a rapid wild west style shot of all 6 bullets.  Damage might need adjusted or additional recoil, but this would make it another meaty close range option.

For the hand cannon, I thought it would be cool to have impulse effect. So for example, if you shoot it it knocks you back, and that could lend itself to tricks like shooting down for a boost or backwards. Another thought I had was maybe it has so much force that it knocks back who it hits too.

They never want to rush or challenge me unless if i was rushing them. So im asking here in this subreddit is there anyone have great ideas about challenges we can play it in playground which we are forced to kill each other. Plz give me some ideas ",FortNiteBR

For example the Tomato Town diner and gas stations have different looking brick textures. In the container yard there are multiple different metal textures. The houses in Pleasant Park have different colors.

I know and agree this wouldn't make much of a difference in regular Battle Royale, but it would allow us more creativity in the Playground LTM. Or maybe you have other ideas on what you could do with an option like this.

Do you think it would be a nice feature if we could switch between these textures? Just to clarify, I am not suggesting additional materials on top of wood/brick/metal.

Let me know your thoughts and ideas of what will happen. 

So, let me start of with the Visitor and his plan. At the start of season 4 we saw a trailer which included a video at risky reels about space. If you watch carefully you see that as the small meteor rocks smash through the screen the UFO in the video perfectly avoids the small meteors coming through the screen and after dodging the small meteors the big meteor smashes through the screen right through where the UFO is. We don't see the UFO again after this. This could be a representation of the Visitor in his escape pod. 

What if the Visitor's home planet was destroyed by the meteors and was in direct collision course and the Visitor escaped in a escape pod being the only survivor. Unfortunately before he is able to escape he is hit by the large meteor as seen in the video at risky and his escape pod is encrusted in the meteor. For all we know the Visitor could have been inside the meteor for years which is how he got so far into the meteor rock. How else did he get into the meteor in his pod? 

After possibly years of floating though space the meteor finally crashed down on the island and the Visitor was freed by the government and then broke out of the facility before the government could interrogate him. The Visitor found the rocket and engineered it using the hop rocks he stole to be able to travel through time. The Visitor stole hop rocks from the meteor site closest to the villain base and the ones that were delivered to snobby (as can be seen by all the turned over cars) 

what is happening with the other hop rocks we don't know yet but they are still going to snobby even after the rocket has launched and could be possibly going to the villain base still and it could be turned into a government lab for season 5 as we can see the lab at Dusty has been disassembled.  

The rocket launch was successful and as we know the superheroes were all a part of a movie and were fake so they did not save tilted. The Visitor was never trying to destroy tilted and is not hostile towards the people living on the island. The Visitor was actually most likely using weak points in space and time that he could tear through to get enough speed to go back in time. That's why the Visitor set specific coordinates as we heard upon launch. The lasers pointing at tilted were just Epic trolling us as everyone's first thought is that tilted is going to be destroyed. 

The Rocket is most likely intended to explode as it is a ""rocket"" and the Visitor was most likely not on board the rocket as we could hear him inputting coordinates when the rocket had launched. I think the Visitor sent the rocket through the weakest point in space and time he could find and sent the rocket into the past to blow up the largest meteor and save his home. 

This would also reverse all the damage to dusty as we haven't seen any repairs being made like other POI's. The smaller meteor damage will remain as the smaller meteors won't be blown up by the rocket. 

Although the Visitor succeeded he also messed up badly leaving the rip in the sky and messing up the past. As we all know you should never try to change the past. This could result in the tear in the sky getting worse as we've seen and smaller time rifts consuming certain POI's and reversing certain parts of the map back in time.

One part of the map could be Ancient Egypt, one part could be a Jurassic Jungle and other things like the Wild West. There is no confirmation of the battle pass even being history themed. This is all relying on leaks. Not to mention the playground mode trailer released by Epic a few days ago includes various builds such as a Western town, pyramids, a sphinx and a castle. There have also been leaks of old styled objects found in the files. 

This would make sense and all adds up. How this will be fixed we don't know yet. We also haven't seen Moisty get destroyed yet and that was rumoured to be happening soon. It would make sense as the movie is now over so we will 100% see a change to Moisty next season.  Maybe Moisty could become a huge desert due to its size. 

This is just my theory and I can't wait to see what happens. If you read this far then you deserve an award lol. Thanks for reading :) ",FortNiteBR

But can we set the egos aside for a moment. 

When I was new to the game I decided there was only a few situations that could be taken better if I was building. And as I played I simply started building during every interaction because all the pros say ""just build"". I got pretty good at just building which definitely helped me win a lot of fights. But BUT Butttttt I also noticed that when I ran across a good player and I built, I was at more of a disadvantage. The reason being, you waste tons of mats trying for high ground then you end up unable to build off the high ground. 

Over the last like 20 or so games I have played I decided that when I seen a try hard building like there's no tomorrow I would simply wait for them to take there seat in that high ground and then I would just ramp rush without building up to their base. I would do this until I reach the bottom of their base then they're forced to come out since you can take their builds down. I understand this is already a clear strategy but my point is to hear other opinions. I feel like if you tell someone just build, they end up thinking that they're building so they should be able to win against most players...not the case...just my thoughts... ",FortNiteBR

I'm not a top player nor I'm a bad player (or maybe I'm?). 3.0+ K/D and 380 wins (considering KD as a skill indicator even if it is arguable). I cannot play the game 4 hours day, so I play when I can, when I'm not studying/working.

But the game is not fun anymore for me. I cannot play a single match without finding good players (or at least players with my skill level). It is really hard to kill someone with my same skill level and then kill another player with the same skill level and so on. No mats, no healing because the player you just defeated had probably already used all mats and healing fighting you. Some months ago this was never happening. It is really rare to found a lot of good players in a single match. 

I'm start thinking there is  SBMM system into this game. It is the ""survival of the fittest"" but that doesn't mean you have to put all players with the same skill level in the same lobby. That is not how a battle royale should be (I.M.O).

Luck is an important factor and make this game not competitive. If you play against people with the same skill level then luck is even more important.

I'm playing less and less at this game. If before I used to get angry at this situation, now I resign myself to this situation by closing the game and doing something else in my free time.

I think this game is fun for bad players (they enjoy every environment with their friends) and it is fun for very good players (for them is hard to find players with their same skill level). For people like me, people in the middle, it is not fun anymore. 

At least we can play Playground with friends. ",FortNiteBR

 I also miss a crucial part of my shots in medium range fights (AR shots), and making idiotic plays and desicion I wouldn't have made 2 months ago.

Hear me out; I think the lights look great, and I like to use them, but it seems ridiculous that such a hard grind has such a meager reward. There's nothing else included, in fact, it would've been great to have a back-bling or glider as an extra reward, considering Omega doesn't have either, yet, lights.. Hurray..
Me and my brother have been playing for ~6 hours a day, had the battle pass since the start, completed every challenge and still had to rush to finish it before the end of Season 4. It took around 60 hours to go from level 68 to 78, and that was using the fastest methods. It may have been easy for the certain individuals who purchased tiers at the start of the season, but we've barely made it, even though we've had to throw away a large portion of our time to be able to make it.
I don't care much about this season, but I hope Epic, that you will never make such a challenge again, and I'm probably going to take a break from Fortnite for awhile, because I'm just so drained.
I hope to see more intriguing challenges, like in season 3, compared to the monotonous ones introduced this season.

This has been suggested a thousand times, but we’ve never had a response from Epic, that’s what I’m aiming at here.

Having the Playground as a permanent mode is a good thing for the playerbase in every way. Newcomers to this game struggle a lot with building mechanics and never really get a chance to learn them outside of public matches. Players that want to further increase their skill and practice stuff can do that in this mode, they’re free to practice for an hour at a time, that allows huge improvements per match.

Then there is the creative side, this community had already proved to be extremely creative, and this allows us to build whatever whenever. This opens a whole new side to the game, much more than we previously could, Epic you need to let this mode stay.

Some comments will probably say that it will be stale, and that is true, but again, then don’t play it.

Letting the hype for the mode settle down is actually a good thing, not do I know a lot about servers but I do know that there will be less stress on the matchmaking service with fewer players trying to connect every day. Stress on servers was another argument I’ve seen.

A lot won’t be able to play this mode, at all, we don’t know how long it’ll be out, but loads of players including myself will probably not get to experience the mode this time in rotation, if it ever comes back. We want more from this game now, we need something that we can take a break in when the public matches get too much.

Epic, if we won’t have it permanently, could you at least fill us in on why not and when it’ll be in rotation again? Thanks in advance.",FortNiteBR

Players can just spin around not even thinking about what they are doing and they can build just as fast as a person that has been playing for months. Maybe not as well but you don't really require skill to press your wall button and spin around as fast as you can without thinking.

We've all seen and experienced bloom fucking us over in certain situations. The front page literally has a post about shit bloom everyday. However, the bloom is consistent, and shots usually land where they should. Fortnite without bloom would make having high ground an insane advantage, while also causing many more incidences of ""lasering"" people from 100 metres. Different guns have different roles; a shotgun or smg should be used up close, an ar should be used at ranges of 30-125m, and a sniper/scoped rifle should be used for anything further. The aim part of this game is balanced based off everyone having bloom and everyone having the tools to work around it. Bloom is only really an issue with headshots, as a lucky headshot can determine a fight. Bloom in the majority of cases is not determining a fight, unless the two fighting are literally just on the ground and ar spamming each other without building. Every player has the tools to work around bloom, and shots can still accurately hit at a range where the AR excels.

Tl;dr bloom is a core mechanic of this game with counterplay minus the extreme examples",FortNiteBR

I think they should increase their damage to structures by 2x for revolvers and 2.5x for Deagles. It's really decent and I can think of a lot of ways to use that one-shot building potential.

The pump was the only semi-consistent damage dealer in this game, everything else is plagued by you shitty bloom. And apparently people want to have ""options"" for close range fights... ok fine, that's a totally reasonable thing to ask for... but, instead of nerfing the pump, buff the other close range weapons to be just as effective as the pump. If Epic did this, they would've made players on both ends of the spectrum happy. But no, Epic said... skilled players are driving away our money making minions.

That's not mention all of the building nerfs &amp; explosive buffs that they added (Rockets now destroy walls that are not in line of sight, are you fucking kidding?)

Overall I can still enjoy it playing a few games a day but I feel like there's no longterm goal to grind for anymore after 100 wins it's not that exciting to win the last battle compared to playing against a super good opponent early game?

478,xMashu,1530696261,8w0buz,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8w0buz/the_state_of_items/,3,The State of Items,"Hello all, 

The state of items this game worries me sometimes. The devs at Epic have a habit of adding an item every week or so and that worries me a bit for the long term health of this game -- it could easily become overcrowded. You may notice lately you see a lot less of certain items you might like unless they are blue tier or lower. Here are some changes that I thought of that could vault really bad items and make other items represent their value/rarity ratio: 

 **Pistols** 

* Pistols aren't that bad but they're also not that great. They do a lot of damage but other weapons of similar range can put out just as much damage but have a lot of forgiving aspects like clip size and lower rarity 

**Deagle/Revolvers**

* Vault the revolvers (Grey/Green/Blue) and reduce the Deagle's rarity to (Blue/Purple) 

**Silenced Pistols/Pistol** 

* Vault the pistols (Grey/Green/Blue) and again reduce the rarity of the silenced to (Blue/Purple) 

**Snipers** 

* Snipers are in a pretty good spot at the moment, but the semi auto is a problem to be honest. But when you start picking a green Hunting Rifle up over a Golden Semi-Auto there's a problem. I don't think the semi auto should be vaulted though, because it is the only sniper with more than one shot in the clip.

* Reduce the rarity of the Semi-Auto from (Purple/Gold) to (Blue/Purple) so it matches the power of its counterpart, Scoped AR, which fires more shots but does less damage. 

**Explosives** 

* Either the clingers or the grey nades should be vaulted, probably the grey nades since they serve less purpose than the clingers and the clingers are fresh. 

**Minigun**

* Something needs to be done about this gun, and I don't have a good approach. The minigun is either the most useless thing in the world (any time early/mid/most of late game), or the best thing ever (last 1v1 in solos, a squad vs 1-2 people where the squad has the minigun, etc.) 

* A good option would be to vault it since the LMG and Tommy Gun behave somewhat similar to the minigun but are much more practical and have a lot more use than the very small cliche use of the minigun. Or you could reduce the rarity to you guessed it, (Purple/Gold) --&gt; (Blue/Purple) 

* Option 3 would be to add a cooldown mechanic but increase the damage it does per bullet to the player as a tradeoff. It's structure damage is already insane. 

You might think, wow all this guy really wants to do is take a lot of legendary items and make them slightly less common, while vaulting their useless lower tier, and you'd be exactly right. Ask yourself, is the Deagle worthy of being a legendary tier item? What about the semi auto? Isn't it weird how some blue items like the pump and the grenade launcher/Rpg are really good and reliable and you are happy to find, and that some legendary and purple weapons are considered really bad troll weapons? 

Of course all this should not and couldn't happen at once, vaulted stuff needs to be done over time. But the rarity/value ratio of a lot of guns needs to be addressed as well as the possibility of things becoming overcrowded.

Obviously Subreddit rules are there for a reason, but I’ve notice so many posts lately with tons of upvotes and comments getting removed shortly after for ridiculous reasons. Like a post about tomato town today got removed for “low effort/low quality humor,” but if it was so low quality why would it have gotten so many upvotes. I posted a skin concept and it was removed for “not promoting discussion.” These reasons make no sense.

Basically the point of this is that quality posts should be determined by the sub not by the preference of one or two moderators. Obviously continue to manage rules like witch hunting and the like. But leave the 10-20K posts alone please. 

The worst part is they’ll do this at the height of a post and stop it’s momentum entirely. I don’t know if it is possible to reinstate a post after getting removed but I know they wouldn’t try. Anytime I’ve had a post removed they say to message the mods for questions and I’ve yet to get a response from any of the times I’ve messaged them. Still never gotten a response. Even after messaging specific mods instead. 

TL:DR: Mods are removing posts for unexplained/bad reasons killing good posts and not responding to mod mail. ",FortNiteBR

I’m praying that crack in the sky means a new map because I feel like that is a sole reason I feel this way. What makes you want to keep getting better? ❤️",FortNiteBR

So I played in playground last night and it was fun for a while but then I got really bored.

I think my expectation was that I could have loads of people in a match and we could BR it as a big-ish group. The reality is a couple of friends and 1v1s which the map is too big for. Finding the right weapons for a specific type of battle is also annoying. Maybe if weapons could be selected as you go in? Like match types.

I can see the benefit of learning building etc but tbh I prefer proper matches. ",FortNiteBR

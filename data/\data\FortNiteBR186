Find a part where he doesn’t have the glider deployed you’ll see it says Beach Umbrella, but the glider is like a gold foil on the top and honestly it’s a sick glider. That’s why I wanted to know what it was.

It will also fill in an area that's empty at this moment.

I'm not saying it want my own fault, and really that's the point, I want to be able to improve against better players. I'm not saying xbox doesny have great builders or great players but its just seems like a very different playstyle.

It isn't fair to everyone else around you. So to balance this, how about we remove all green/rare/epic/legendary floor spawns. Meaning that you would only get common guns from the floor. Also add all of the floor spawn only items to chests. Also, every game on your first chest opened in a game you should only get a common gun/weapon. But every other weapon you get from any other chest that game you can get literally anything. Also. common weapons should be removed from chests.

**Rift to go changes:** This item is too easily counterable. It should just rift you into the sky without spawning a rift for 10 seconds or however long it lasts. Also to balance this out, you should not be able to pick up any items while the timer on it is going before it rifts you.

Are you serious ? You remove the c4 that was a great thing to break big towers in late game but keep this noob gun in the game ? Why ?! This gun just pisses every one off, guys just spam you with that, there's no way to buildfight or just build to get safe and i don't even talk about the dammages that it does to players. If you want to keep this trash gun in the game, at least just remove the dammages to the players, make it only doing dammages for contrusctions cause if i judge the game by what i saw this lastt 2 days i just returned to the game, I might stop really soon again and you can say that I can leave if I don't like it but I'm 100% positiv saying that i'm not the only one getting pissed off by this thing.

TV's all over the Fortnite map showed a countdown. When it hit 0, the Earth shook as a rocket raced into the sky. It shot downward and disappeared into a flash of light, amazing players and spectators alike, uniting enemies and allowing them to view the spectacle together. The rocket  shot across the map, flew upwards, and disappeared with a great BANG and a shockwave through the sky. Over time, this ""shatter"" grew in size, and then it shrank. It let out lightning, and then it disintegrated in a massive lightning bolt that created a cube. This cube began rolling around the Fortnite map on a timer. Then it fell into our own Loot Lake and turned it bouncy. Then....

Nothing.

Not a single live event has happened since.

Epic has set the bar too high, and fans have come to expect every single little change in the map to be a live event, me included. They spoiled us with all this eye-candy and haven't satisfied our hunger since. Everyone, you need to remind yourselves that not EVERYTHING is going to happen live. You remember the rocket launch? It was live. Queues ran up to 45 minutes just to get in, and by the time you did, it was already done. Epic has learned from this. The fans have not.

Since 50v50 has been removed, playing Solos and Duos is now so much more fun than it has ever been before. I finally get to see many other players/noobs just like me in the lobby and it just makes everything so much better!

Pro players have just kept on improving and I would always lose to a guy I couldn't even see building over me, because of my 20 fps laptop and mostly my bad skills at the game (even though I've been playing since S3). It just wasn't fun, the gap is too big and I could almost never survive till Top 10 unless I camped like a Jonesy.

Now that there are other players who miss 9 shots out of 10 like I do, it's so much more rewarding to play Solos and Duos, even when I lose and he's with 1HP left, because I can get to see which little improvements I can make next games to survive, e.g. build a little more, change between shotgun and SMG more often, etc. That could not happen before because there were just so many things I would do wrong that I could never know how to improve. (On a side note, I still really hope for a matchmaking system based on the fps of the players, I have to avoid 1v1 otherwise I get to 5 fps at best)

I personally like 50v50 because it can help you finish some of those tougher battlepass missions, but I'd much rather have it like this, where I can learn how to improve my game by facing against other players like me, so that I have a little margin of error and still manage to get a kill without getting one-pumped.

Many won't agree with me, as title says it's ""unpopular"" (actually doesn't anymore, gets removed otherwise), so it's okay, I know. Just wanted to share this because it definitely feels like playing a more balanced game since 50v50 was removed.",FortNiteBR

#This weeks topic is: **the Minigun**

We would like to set specific focused feedback points on the Minigun to base your conversation on, potential talking points are:

* What about the Minigun is working well?
* Would limiting the Minigun to specific game modes such as duos/squads have an affect on its power?
* Would the Minigun be better/worse if it limits your movement speed?
* Would introducing a cool-down feature to the gun make the gun more balanced and how often should this be?
* Should the drop rate and ways the gun can be acquired be adjusted and if so how much?
* Should the weapon be kept the same with no additional changes?

Keep all discussion regarding this topic within this thread and give negative and positive feedback on this topic. You are free to express and discuss your feelings on this topic, its place in the current meta and anything which you may think should be changed about it.

Islands started floating and travelling towards the main island. Now we are only a few hours away from a (supposed) live event. I can’t wait for the next 2 months of the season, it’s gonna be good.

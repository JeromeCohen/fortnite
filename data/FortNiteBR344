I‚Äôm pretty sucky at fortnite 8 wins in over a 1000 solo games (a lot of top 25s and top tens with 2-8 kills ) I generally play aggressive probably too aggressive for my skill level but screw it I have fun 

But have you Ever had one of those night where nothing you do works (I even missed the map going for the underground lair at the house near snobby ) 

I hate shot gun fights jumping round like a fucking loon trying to dodge a pump/tac strat player I‚Äôve worked hard to improve my sniping and every fight I had last night came down to shotguns 

Couldn‚Äôt build worth a damn 
Got snuck up more times than I care to count after taking out a couple of guys healing up 
One game had a fabulous load out feeling. Good landed at moisty had to chase the circle to junk 

I guess it was just one of those nights but man I nearly threw my PS4 out the window and vowed never to play the game again 

And despite all that frustration and annoyance and turning the air with expletives that would make a sailor blush I‚Äôll be on again tonight 

see you on the island

However, 99% of the time, players ditch their throwables as soon as they need to make some space for another item. Throwables, especially grenades, barely see any play in the game.

I think adding an extra slot just for throwables will add a lot to the game. Grenades would see a lot of play, New tactics and plans would appear and fights would be more interesting.

I know some people would say that this will get boring because every fight will have some players spamming grenades. We can solve this issue by limiting stacking grenades number *in the throwable slot* from 10 to somewhere between 4-5.

Players almost never use grenades late game, and they certainly won't bother stacking 10 grenades when they are in the top 10 at this stage of the game, so adding a throwable slot with a 4-5 limit for grenades could be good for the game.

The nature of a Battle Royale makes it so there are few negative interactions between players. (I came from League - Jesus.) 

However, people killing you when downed is a bad aspect of the game. It's one of the few negative interactions two players can have. Plus, other than for the perverse fun of screwing the other team, killing a downed players doesn't feel rewarding.

Here's a solution: instead of killing players when they're down, shooting them causes them to ""pass out"", dropping their loot and making them immobile. But they aren't dead- they can still get picked up, it just takes longer.

With the passing out mechanic, one person in your squad doesn't have to wait for 20 minutes because someone griefed them. 

BUT what about early game fights when you need a gun? FIX: Shoot them for 100 damage and they drop all if their loot.

BUT what if the downed person is giving info to their team? FIX: Deal 100 damage to the downed players and they ""pass out"" in addition to dropping their loot.  When passed out they can't see, hear, or move.

BUT what if they got knocked from far away? Right now we can secure the kill, but could we with passing out? Well, sorta. If the delay for picking someone up is long enough then it should be. Regardless, this is a small issue.

Epic can make squads experiences more fun by removing the grief mechanic. It isn't necessary and just detracts from the fun of the game. The good things about it - getting loot and stopping information - can be accomplished by a ""passing out"" mechanic.

TL;DR: don't let peiple kill downed players. Instead, people should always be rescuable.",FortNiteBR
30,squrilboy,1525413314,8gx13q,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8gx13q/unpopular_opinion_dusty_divet_extremely_slowed/,0,Unpopular opinion: Dusty Divet extremely slowed the game down.,"Ever since the update, nearly every solo game you have 30+ people landing Dusty Diver, in duo's you have 30-40 people land there, and in squads you can have up to 40+ landing there. This slows down the game entirely leaving sometimes up to only 50 people remaining when the first circle begins to start moving.

Not to mention you still have up to 20 people landing to tilted which leaves sometimes only 30-50 people landing everywhere else on the map. It's rare to find a lot of people unless you're landing tilted or dusty. 

Retail used to be my go-to land spot and it was always populated with plenty of squads landing there, now 8/10 games my team is the only squad going retail. I'm not sure if that's the same for any other places because I usually only land retail/pleasant. 

It's hard to get high kill games and constantly be fighting without wanting to deal with majority of the server being at either tilted or duty. Usually we're stuck just running around chasing circle or looking for people but never find any due to the amount of any type of spread on the map. 

Although I do love the idea of the jump rocks and appreciate all of the effort Epic has put into this update, but I do hope that Dusty Divet does get ""repaired"" eventually and becomes a place where not 30-40% of the server will land to and ruin the pace of the game.

Also I did not include the battle pass but if you do have it just multiply whatever total xp you gain by the &amp;#37; you get added. For example 70&amp;#37; gain would multiply .7 to whatever xp you got from the following types of xp and then add that to your total. I am sure I have flaws in my testing but I thought I would share what I learned from a couple of days of tracking games and the xp earned. I played over 40 games of Fortnite BR over the past couple of days \(I know I play too much\), and I learned some interesting things about xp. I did all my testing on solo matches so I cannot say if duos or squads are the same but i would be interested in finding that out. 

A small note about how I tracked the info. All games were played on PS4. I timed each match \(starting my timer when you are first able to drop from the battle bus and ending when I died\). I went through the after match recap screen and recorded everything there and then looked at my xp bar post game to see if it increased the same about. Short story is, all xp shown in the recap is what you get. No more no less.

Alright on to the findings. There are three types of xp gained from playing games. Survival time, placement xp and eliminations. That's right as sad as it was to find out, opening chests and ammo crates do not give xp. I spent many games opening as many as I could only to find out that it did not give me any xp.

**Survival Time\-** This type of xp you get just by staying alive for a certain amount of time. Kills and how many people are left do not effect how much survival time xp you get at the end of the match. Here are the first 10 minutes of the game and how much xp you get:

1min \- 17xp        6min \- 85xp

2min \- 17xp        7min \- 102xp

3min \- 17xp        8min \- 119xp

4min \- 51xp        9min \- 136xp

5min \- 68xp        10min \- 153xp

A little after the 3 minute mark is when xp starts to go up and I believe that it is every 30 seconds that your xp will increase. My higher 20\+ minute games had 250 xp so you can see simply lasting a long time is a pretty good way of gaining xp, however looking at the first 10 minutes you get 153 vs a 20 minute game you only get 250. That means you only get 100 more xp for the second 10 minutes you played. Maybe longer games are not xp efficient? If youre getting the Victory Royale it probably is, or if you get good placement xp.

**Placement Xp\-** This is very simple. You place in the top 25 and you are guaranteed some sort of extra xp. Here is how its broken down:

25\-21 \- 10xp        10\-2 \- 100xp

20\-11 \- 25 xp        1 \- \(Sadly I haven't won a match this season so if someone could let me know below ill update this!\)

Basically you want to either win the match or get top 10 for the most xp. I found that games that last around 10\-15 minutes is the sweet spot to get into the top 10 and get a decent amount of survival time xp.

**Kills Xp\-** Until recently kills were not giving experience but now they give the normal amount. For your first kill you get 50xp, every consecutive kill after that will net you 20xp. If i had a game with 3 kills I would have 90xp. 10 kills would be 230xp. This is a good way of getting more xp \(if you can manage to get at least one kill\).

**My final thoughts\-** If you're interested in leveling up fast, the best way is to win as many games as possible as long as they do not last more than 15 minutes. But, if you're like me and cant win every game. Making it into the top 10 with at least one kill \(hopefully more\) between 10\-15 minutes is the perfect time to earn a decent amount of xp. 

10 min survival with 4 kills and top 10 would net you 363xp every 15ish minutes if you include loading times. Of course using the battle pass is great if you can because it will only increase your xp! Let me know what you think guys! I would love some feedback on your experiences with xp.",FortNiteBR

No, I don't give up high-ground after they're dead, I tend to shotgun them underneath me, grab loot, and then build up as high as I can to heal.

I play on console and don't have a lot of time to get good at the game but holy crap. I feel like the pistol evens somethings out. It doesn't mess around and I have killed every type of player with it. Again I don't win every fight, like a tac shotgun or SMG will still probably own you, but don't skip over it.

Ive been on top of the leaderboards in multiple xbox games like smite and call of duty, BUT boy let me tell you how awful and practically self torturous the fortnite leaderboards are. 

1st... you dont have to be great or extremely skilled (Atleast on console, cant speak for PC) all you need to be is decent enough to get a win. On console its very abnormal to run into a really skilled player. They exist but this game is free and accessible to the millions of people who own gaming console. If youre decent to say the least you can drop at the corner of the map loot for 20minutes make top 10 while every one kills each other then easily swoop in and win the game.

2nd..... so getting wins is not really difficult. It mainly comes down to how many hours you put in. So the ""leaderboard race"" becomes this 16 hours a day grind which just is absolutly horrible. Any breaks you take could cost you a potential win. Some people have 2 or more people playing on one account so they dont miss out on any wins when they sleep etc. 

Lastly... this wasnt a hate post on anyone or epic games. Just letting anyone who wants to grind the global leaderboards to know what they are getting themselves into. Its not really skill based, you just need to be above average and have to put a huge amount of hours into killing casual players to rank up. Its pretty harsh after the first few hours you stop having fun and just get drained. 


TL;DR If you plan on grinding to be top page on global wins at the start of a new season you need to put a min of 10+ hours a day.",FortNiteBR

Hi there, some of you might have seen my [fortnite math](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8goetn/fortnite_math_battle_pass_tier_and_season_level/) post from earlier. Well, a lot of awesome people were in the comments and helped me get some more data. There were a few common questions that came up, and one big one people seemed to want to know was how long would it take to grind up to some certain level. So I decided to take the information I got there and whip up a small calculator.

A Few notes, for anyone who cares (which frankly, you shouldn't unless you're a nerd):

1. This doesn't take everything into account. It gets most of the Bonus XP from challenges, but it misses the 5k you get from the battle pass. 

2. It also doesn't weigh your current tier and make estimates about your average XP/min based on increased bonus XP at higher tiers, because frankly I was too lazy to work up a decent formula for that. I might do it later, but right now I can't be bothered.

3. I'm super new to google docs, so right now anyone can edit this thing. I don't know how to keep it from getting griefed but also give people access to use it, so I'm trusting you, r/fortnitebr. don't let me down. If anyone knows a better way to share this stuff, please comment or send me a PM.

4. If you scroll down a little, there's a section for a guest book. Feel free to leave your name or a comment if you want.

Anyway, I hope some of you out there find this useful.",FortNiteBR

Sniper one shotting is fine because it actually takes skill, bullet drop and having to line up the shot/distance.

But this is coming from a player with 900+ wins (no not trying to brag) I've gotten many one pump kills I didn't deserve and gotten one pumped many of times too and most of the time when I do get one pumped it is from a guy who doesn't even know how to build, has less than 10 wins, or is a complete noob. (Not trying to be rude) 

Maybe even make a potion in the game that is called 1 shot protector so that you won't get one pumped by a shotty and it will hit 199 instead, it wouldn't completely kill the pump because you can easily just switch to tac shotty or tac smg by atleast you'll have a split second to build.",FortNiteBR

Here's an idea:,"There are so many interesting game-play mechanics in Fortnite but the over-prominence and player's reliance on the shotgun really brings the rest of the game down. 

# The problem

Beyond bunny-hopping-shotguns being mandatory in close-range encounters to begin with, at least 60% of players I fight against only focus on getting close enough to you where they can build a staircase and drop down on you, which is ridiculously overpowered because:

* You can't stop them from doing that unless you have specific weapons, such as the LMG or Minigun, because no other weapon can output enough consistent damage to 'shut down' shotgun-stairs from getting off the ground or even continue past 1-2 stair pieces. Even if you can destroy their staircase they'll already closed some distance between you with no risk to them. Everyone has a shotgun, yet the previous two aforementioned weapons are more rare and situational (and therefore not always worth picking up).

* One of the shotgun's weaknesses, the lack of effectiveness beyond short-range, is negated during this tactic by giving you a strong barrier between you and the enemy player while you close the distance.

* Jumping down onto an enemy with a shotgun takes an already supremely powerful point-blank weapon and essentially increases the chances of inflicting a massive critical damage boost on their head by making it a proportionally larger ratio of the target.

* The QOL change that enables building structures continually by holding down the build button reduces the effort required to do this, and therefore makes the tactic even easier to execute.

* Outside of specific weapons or unusual situational circumstances there are no effective counters that give you an advantage.

# The Solution

Shotguns being overpowered is an issue in and of itself, but here's a simple idea to work towards making the infamous shotgun-stairs tactic not so godly. In summary: introduce a non-linear health build-up to the construction of stairs.

Here is what the health buildup of stairs is like currently:

[https://i.imgur.com/y2GQQ8K.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/y2GQQ8K.jpg)

And here is my proposed change:

[https://i.imgur.com/RVUir9X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/RVUir9X.jpg)

Why would this help? Because it reduces the effectiveness of using stairs as a form of protected locomotion for shotgunners. If you catch someone in time who's about to do this you can stop them using guns such as the assault rifle which currently aren't powerful enough to destroy shotgun-stairs before the enemy has already closed significant distance on you. Currently people can skirt across open fields towards you using nothing more than wooden stairs and stay protected while doing so. Currently stairs can absorb a good amount of damage soon after being build, with this change you would be able to destroy those staircases much sooner, forcing the enemy to build walls and protect themselves or engage you in a firefight at the current range. 

This doesn't hamper stair's ability to protect you in fortified positions as they'll still have the same amount of health after being fully constructed. You should be encouraged to use walls and floors as protection. Stairs should be used to elevate or lower yourself between places, not also simultaneously acting as a strong barrier as you do so. Intuitively it makes sense a wall is designed to guard you.

Better players can fortify stairs as they build them (by placing walls under them simultaneously) but this requires more resources and only reduces your risk as there will still be angles the stairs are vulnerable from. At the very least the skill floor to successfully execute shotgun-stairs will be raised from extremely-easy to at least somewhat challenging. You're right in thinking this isn't a be-all-end-all counter to the nefarious tactic, but it does create a very balanced counter: paying attention. If you're being diligent and watching all of your angles (as you should be) you're rewarded by being able to counter this extremely common but overly-powerful strategy. The enemy will have to engage you in a traditional firefight or find a way of more riskily closing the distance between you in order to use a shotgun. You should be able to stop players running directly at you by firing at them (at least discourage them, come on). 

tl;dr stairs need a non-linear health ramp while being constructed that allows you to more-easily destroy them while being built to stop players with shotguns using them as a form of barricaded locomotion towards you. ",FortNiteBR

7th! Still with the hiding in the tree's and chasing the edge of the storm and hiding behind trees when I have to jump down. 

Two weeks goes by before I hear a screech from the livingroom. he made it to 5th. He is -stoked-. Because now I have to play and beat him by getting to 5th place. So everyone is at school, the kids I care for are gone, I have an hour to kill. Time to hide in tree's.

I [commented](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8gqlh5/exp_difference_season_4_and_season_3/dydwsom/) in another thread but it was upvoted so much I decided to make a full post. I also need to credit /u/frvwfr2 who got the formula right except for some minor mistakes (his answer is 4% off of mine).

So I decided to ask all of my friends what their level is and how much XP is required to level up. Then I watched around 10 stream archives and accumulated data of leveling progression levels 1-51. The rest is based purely on speculation as no one leveled up that high. The XP required to level up from level N-1 to level N is:

* For levels 1: 100 XP
* For levels 2-5: 100 + PREVIOUS XP
* For level 6: 350 + PREVIOUS XP
* For levels 7-20: 100 + PREVIOUS XP
* For levels 21-41: 150 + PREVIOUS XP
* For levels 42-61: 200 + PREVIOUS XP
* For levels 62-81: 250 + PREVIOUS XP
* For levels 82-100: 300 + PREVIOUS XP (not sure about that one)

A simple and pretty accurate formula is:

&gt; =[PREVIOUS XP]+100+FLOOR([CURRENT LEVEL]/20)*50

The above one works pretty fine if you start at level 6 - 750 and go up. Sadly it loses some XP because of weird level grouping. The accurate (but weird) formula is:

&gt; = =[PREVIOUS XP]+IF([CURRENT LEVEL]=6;350;IF([CURRENT LEVEL]&lt;=20;100;IF([CURRENT LEVEL]&lt;=41;150;IF([CURRENT LEVEL]&lt;=61;200;IF([CURRENT LEVEL]&lt;=81;250;300)))))

It calculates all of the XP accurately up to level 100. Using this formula you can calculate that the total XP required for level **80** is **474750**. That number is 33% bigger than the one from /u/Error-in-Syntax post but almost two times smaller than the XP required to get level 80 last season (based on [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zpjnvlj-osOywNYkvDMcx-YktPrpPcN5MmXDWzlmX2I/edit) spreadsheet). Sadly the XP is much harder to get at lower level, which gives us a much more linear experience.

**TL;DR:** The XP required to get all the way to level 80 is **474750** which is much bigger than what yesterday's post suggested but almost two times smaller than is was last season.",FortNiteBR

233,BasicallyAProButNot,1525370469,8gsdon,23,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8gsdon/balancing_the_rpg/,0,Balancing the RPG,"First off I want to say that I understand the it‚Äôs an RPG and should do some damage BUT this is a game and when something becomes frustrating to play against and cheap to use I think it should be changed. Let‚Äôs remember we are here to have fun. So let‚Äôs get into the balance 

They move so slow so they are not very good at killing people at range and I think they designed them that way on purpose so they could be used to destroy people‚Äôs bases. The slow travel speed of the rocket means nothing up close however I would like to see them increase the damage to structures but lower the amount of damage done to players. 

This will make the RPG still useful for removing shields on squads that are grouped together and be used as a splash damage weapon. I do think if you get direct impacted you should die in one shot however while it is frustrating sometimes you can‚Äôt argue with someone hitting you directly with one of them. 

Also can we lower the amount of Rockets you get most of the time I play squads we have 40-50 rockets between us and at the end can just spam rockets forever it feels cheap to get kills and frustrating to die to also lower rockets means players will have to focus their shots more and can‚Äôt just free spam especially on players and will hopefully have them used as anti fort weapons rather than the all-purpose they are now. 

If anyone has any tips on how to play against rocket spam let me know because currently I have tried rushing them but then it‚Äôs impossible to dodge the rocket even while building and you have to be on the defensive until they eventually run out of rockets or their teammate kills you. I‚Äôve also tried keeping my distance so I can see and predict the rocket due to its slow travel time but I don‚Äôt really have time to pull out my weapon and return fire. 

Edit- wow I think a really good way to nerf the rockets is to decrease the amount of shots you get with them and you basically just have to wait it out. 


TL;DR - Give less Rockets away because it‚Äôs frustrating to play against and feels cheap when getting a kill. ",FortNiteBR

So, I've been a player from the start, I've played this game for along time, and I enjoyed it, Epic Games has been recently adding some great editions! Like the Battle Pass (even though this season 4 battle pass feels really rushed, that's a topic for another time.) 

My Problems: 
The shotguns throughout Fortnite have always been problematic, 7dmg shotguns were a thing, yes, but not near as obnoxious as they are now (don't stop reading because I mentioned 7 dmg shotguns). The pump shotgun feels like it's being nerfed far too hard, and the tactical is being buffed too much. Hear me out, I hate being one shot by a pump shotgun, but it's much better then being one shot or hit for 150+ dmg by a tactical shotgun. At least with a pump the other person had some skill, and didn't just spam until they finally hit your head. I loved the pump, but now I have to swap it for the tactical, the pullout time has completely ruined it and made the tactical a far superior option. I've been one shot by tactical shotguns so much now due to this update, it's infuriating. I always feel like I cheated for the other kill with a tactical now due to it's absurd damage output, it's stupidly powerful, and too powerful considering it's pros and cons compared to the pump shotgun. 

My Proposal To Fix: 
Epic Games, you know the 7 damage shotguns were a thing, but PLEASE revert these tactical shotgun changes, remove the pump shotgun pullout time and ONLY have the pullout time activate if a pump shotgun or any gun was fired before. 

Thank you for reading and PLEASE consider changing these things. Epic Games, you've done a great job with this game, don't let the shotguns ruin it.

I know it means that you can only see it when you have been bested by another player but I think its a nice idea. Here is a few ideas ive had: 

Heaven Ascend - You fall to the ground similar to now when you die but a small cloud appears above your character along with a beam of light and the character ascends from the ground with a halo on their head

Dem Bones - the character changes to a skeleton and slowly falls apart

UFO - similar to Heaven Ascend only a small UFO is above the character 

Surrender! - The character digs quickly underground covering their entire body and their hands pops up waving a small white flag

Tombstone! - similar to above only their hand comes up placing a tombstone where they died

Interplanetary travel - A portal opens below the player and they fall into it (think Rick and Morty) 

Hell - A Red demon hand pulls them underground and fire appears in a circle around them

Firework! - the characters feet blast off sending them into the sky and finally exploding like a firework

Superhero - The character crouches and suddenly takes off into the sky leaving a small dust cloud in the ground

Hope you liked the ideas, feel free to add or let me know what your comments around this idea

TL;DR - Unlockable/Purchaseable Skins for Death Animation different that the ""death teleport"" currently used

My solution to that would be to get rid of Bloom and to do that without having very skilled players lazer everyone, I think we would need to add a Strafe move. Strafe would allow you to roll in any direction but it would have a stamina cost just like Jump to avoid the spam. So if you get shot you'd have time to roll a few time to dodge and then start building. 
As for stamina, I believe having a visual notice before you actually run out could be useful. 


Even with Bloom, I have seen people get lazered by a SCAR at medium distance, from 200 HP to 0 in like 1s (multiple headshots), zero time to react and build. Sure, such shots require extreme luck with Bloom but without it, it would be a pretty common thing. That's why I think damage fall off on AR should remain.

On the first day of Season 4, I bought a new PS4 PRO.
After I plugged-in my G502, I realize that my mouse profile doesn't act on my PS4 Pro like it was on ""normal"" PS4. 
The problem is: ""Old"" settings are too sensitive on new console so I changed them for that : 1,500Dpi and 0.04 sensitivity on game.
But, with that settings, I feel the mouse more ""sluggish"", more input lag... There's also a settings for mouse cursor speed in PS option .. slow normal, fast and didn't remember what I had on my old PS4. 

So, my first question : There is someone with G502 (or other mouse) got the same ""problem"" when switching from normal to pro version of the PS4 ?

Second question: There is someone who can recommends me a good sensitivity combo for G502 (dpi + poll rate + PS settings mouse speed + fortine mouse sensitivity) to have almost a PC feeling ?

But it just feels bland running out of it, same thing every time unless you have a launchpad. Solution:
ZOMBIES! Have the Save The World Zombies come out of the ground when the storm closes in, and the closer the storm gets to the middle, the tougher the zombies are. The zombies can't walk out of the storm, so once you are out of the storm you are safe :)

I think this would add a lot of interesting gameplay rather than the usual, ""Oh no we are in the storm, run in a straight line to get out"". The Storm would become a battleground of weaving through the zombies, gradually losing health and avoiding getting caught :D This would be so much fun on Battle Royale, Another great thing will be that people will be more incentivised to make sure they don't get caught in the storm and force them into more fights against other players!

What do you guys think? Too much? Awesome Idea? am I onto something? Or am I bonkers? Because I think this could turn out to be a fantastic asset to Battle Royale.

I like doing math and I got into playing fortnite a couple of weeks ago, so I've been doing some math around the two most obvious numbers in the game: your season level, and battle pass tier.

Let's talk about the battle pass tiers first. Obviously, people want to get to tier 100 by the end of the season. They want all that good loot and the sweet sweet bragging rights that come with showing off omega or John ""The Reaper"" Wick. And the numbers here aren't that hard to get your head around. You start at tier 1, there's no tier 0, and you need 10 stars to get to the next tier, so 990 stars total. Now how do we get those stars? By leveling up?

Well, not really. Every level, you get 2 battle stars, except for levels that end in 5 and 0, where you get 5 stars and 10 stars, respectively. That means every 10 levels, you get 31 stars (2x8 + 5 + 10), so by level 100 (remembering that you don't get stars for level 1) you end with 308 battle stars, enough to get you to Battle Tier 31, and only 2 more stars from 32.

The bulk of your battle stars come from challenges. There are 10 sets of weekly challenges, each worth a total of 50 stars, and the free battlepass challenges are worth 25 total, making 525 stars. Additionally, there's the daily challenge which gives 5 stars a day for the 10 weeks this season goes for, totaling 350 (10 x 7 x 5). From the challenges alone, you are sitting at 875 stars our of the required 990, leaving only 115 to go.

Earlier I mentioned every 10 levels gives 31 battle stars, so by the time you level up 30 times (from 1 to 31), you'll have gained another 93 stars, so now you're down to 22 stars, and you'll hit this when you make it to level 40 (with a 7-star surplus).

And if you bought the battle pass last season, you started this season with a 50-star boost, so you actually don't even need to get to level 40 to reach your goal. Just level 23, actually. (115 - 50 bonus = 65, 65 - 2x31 = 65 - 62 = 3 stars remaining at level 21).

Looking at totals, though, we have...

308 stars for leveling up.

525 stars for battle pass challenges.

350 stars for daily challenges

50 bonus stars if you bought season 3's battle pass.

That's a grand total of 1,183 (or 1,233 with the 50 bonus) stars. Since you only need 990, that gives you 193 (or 243) stars worth of wiggle room to get to tier 100. 

None of that is taking into account that you can straight up buy tiers for V-Bucks, which you earn as you level up (a total of 1500 if you get them all), you get enough to buy 10 tiers (or more, if that 10-tier for 900 vbucks thing comes back), so you'd have another 100 stars of wiggle room in that case.

(as a side note, I think it's awesome that I got enough v-bucks from my season 3 pass to pay for my season 4 pass, and still have extra left over. I'm hoping to do the same for season 5)

Now... Let's talk about season level, because I seriously cannot find information about this. This isn't going to be a long section, honestly it's more like a call for help. As you level up, your XP requirement goes up. It starts at 100 XP to get to level 2, and I think it took 500 XP to get to level 6. Every level, it seems like the requirement went up by 100 XP, but every so often, like every 10 levels or so, the amount it went up by would also go up. To the point where last season when I was in the 60's, every level would increase the XP requirement by 400xp. I'd absolutely love to have a chart of the XP requirements for each level, so if someone knows of one, please let me know, and if not, I'd really appreciate either a comment here or a PM with your current level and the XP it would take to get to your next level.

That's basically it for level in general, but since we're here, let's chat about XP, and how you earn it. There are XP rewards for completing daily challenges, for completing enough challenges in the week's set, and for other specific challenges (like the tier 100 challenges). You also earn XP by playing the game, so let's break down where that XP comes from...

The first, and probably biggest, source of XP comes from time played. You gain 17 XP for every full minute you survive on the island, starting when the ""storm forming in 1 minute"" ends and you see the first circle on your map. It also gives you the 17 XP even if you don't make it past the first minute of that count-down. No matter how early you die, you'll at least get 17 XP. Not a lot, but not nothing.

After that, you get 50 XP if you killed an opponent, and another 20 for every player you kill after that (so 70 total for 2 kills, 90 total for 3, and 110 XP total for 4 kills). If you're good at combat, this can be a pretty decent way to increase your XP quickly, since the first kill is worth about 3 minutes of survival, and every kill after that is another extra minute (and a little extra). if you land somewhere and only live for 3 minutes while running around getting items, but you got a kill, you'll receive 101 XP for a 3-minute game.

Finally, there's placement experience. If you live long enough to be in the top 25, you'll be given an extra 10 XP as a bonus. Make it to the top 10, and that becomes 100 XP. If you get second, it's 200 XP, and a first place victory grants 300 bonus XP. These are the stats for solo mode, the numbers for squads is much different, where basically unless you're in the top 3 squads, you're probably not getting bonus XP for placements. I haven't played squads or duos very much though, so I don't know the exact numbers there.

Getting to the top 25 is basically just living long enough to see the second circle (about 8-9 minutes of play, including waiting to start and dropping from the bus), and if you can live to see the third circle (another 5 minutes), there will usually only be about 9-12 people left, so top 10 there is right around the 13-14 minute mark (you should get about 12 minutes worth of ""survival time"" XP too, for another 204 XP, give or take 17.) After that, it'll be another 5-10 minutes before you're down to the last 2, and that fight might last another 3-5 minutes. Obviously winning the game would be best, but if you're like me, there's about a 0.5% chance of that happening, so let's look at all the options...

Without kills:

live to the top 25: 119 survival + 10 placement = 129 XP, about 14-16 XP a minute, 860-967 XP an hour

live to top 10: 204 survival + 100 placement = 304 XP, about 21-23 XP a minute, 1302-1403 XP an hour

second place: 340 (ish) survival + 200 placement = 540 XP, about 27 XP a minute, 1620 XP an hour

victory: 340 (ish) survival + 300 placement = 640 XP, about 32 XP a minute, 1920 XP an hour

Tack on an extra 50 if you got a kill, and another 20 for each kill after that. 

There's also the curious case of that 3-minute game where you get a kill and die almost immediately. Call it an extra 2 minutes for lobby, waiting for the match to start, and dropping from the bus (which are all factored into the calculations above), you get 101 XP for a roughly 5 minute game, granting you 20 XP a minute, or about 1200 an hour, which is just as good as waiting for a top 10 placement but without all that waiting, and with more combat practice. Though you do have to actually get the kill for this to work, if you die in that fight, you'll end up with 51 XP for 5 minutes, getting you about 10 XP a minute, which is... kinda low.

So yeah, I like math, and I like Fortnite, so I thought I'd share some Fortnite math with you all. I hope this wasn't too dry and dull.",FortNiteBR

Think about it, all of these Superheroes, but then we have the random commandos sprinkled in. Plus tons of locations on the map now have movie sets sprinkled in. Moisty Mire has a massive movie set added in including a ""crashed"" helicopter in front of a green screen. Plus the only truly new area, rather than a remodeled one, is Risky Reels, a Movie Theater. This all lends to the idea that the theme is action movies. 


Not only that, Superhero movies fall into this genre, so we have Carbide and Valor as the good superheros, with Omega being the ""evil twin"" for an antagonist. Zoey is a parallel to Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad, with Teknique possibly fitting in with that if not some sort of tropey anarchist character. And then the bread-and-butter of action movie characters, our Commandos. Squad Leader is the clean-cut, straight-edge hero and Battlehawk is the more violent, somewhat rogue archetype.


So this battle pass isn't just a singular superhero theme, but a much broader Action Movie Theme.

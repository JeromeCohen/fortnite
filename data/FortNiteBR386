Atleast for begginers it sucks alot.

EDIT: i mean think about it, legit every game i 50 players go tilted towers, doing kills and die, some of them to finally face some enemys and dont have to search for then 20 min and some to practice, so why dont we get a mod where 20 people drop in a town with respawn? so we dont have to fucking fly over and over to 1 spot",FortNiteBR

I have tried 7-8 games of Fornite, and really liked everything from the music to the smoothness with which it runs.

But every game so far has been a struggle, whenever people show up they are so fast with building and shooting simultaneously that I struggle to know where they are, let alone shoot them. As it is I have little experience with fps games and my aim is bad.

I was wondering how is matchmaking implemented In the game. Why am I being placed in the same pool of players who are way better than me? I think the game would be more fun if I am placed with noobs like me. Else it is hard to learn if I just die every game.

Given that matchmaking will remain like this how can come up to speed with the game. Any guides would be appreciated.",FortNiteBR

Can we please get some information about this issue? At least that u know about it, coz I really feel like it's being ignored since update went live (memes are getting frontpage, cool clips are getting special tweets, but this issue is totally ignored).  
  
I know that there's still a lot of people that don't have this issue, but for the love of god please, there are also people like me, who really wants to play Fortnite and they clearly can't coz this bug made this game unplayable...  
  
For people that don't get this bug - quick explaination.  
Imagine playing a game and every few seconds your audio/sound just turn off for 0.5-3 seconds and u can't even hear that u're being shot... Or it can happen in a middle of a fight and before you realize the guy you were fighting jumped of his building and he's on your back and u can't hear that.  
  
Make Epic see this, somehow.  
  
It can be PC only problem, I don't know if that's on consoles.  
And no, it's not my PC or any drivers, did everything I could and nothing helped (reinstalled audio drivers, verified Fortnite files, reinstalled Fortnite, restarted PC, tried low audio quality and all of that stuff. There's still no fix on the internet according to other people that reported this bug as well).",FortNiteBR

However, I noticed like two weeks ago that the players I have come up against are getting exponentially better in solos, duos and squads.

Does anyone experience the same thing or am I just getting unlucky?

Edit: I play on PS4. I have played approx. 1000 games with 17% win ratio. Played mainly solos and have played shooters for more than ten years, so I consider myself a skilled player.

Now what if kinda how we have cosmetic pickaxes and cosmetic characters, but we also have cosmetic building.

Basically cosmetic building changes the style that we build or texture. For example if I had a wood cosmetic it would completely change the way my wood looks into what my cosmetic is.

And these cosmetics would have to be something epic creates of course and we can buy from the shop. 

The cosmetics could go as far as birch wood, white wood, maybe even flaming wood or dark wood with thorns around it or something.

Basically this will just be the style that you build in and it's not just wood; that was just an example but you could also have cosmetics for your brick and metal. Whatever styles you guys think of for them put them down in the comments.

I think a neat bonus for the big team modes would be to open the cosmetics pool and give every player a randomly assigned skin.

* First and foremost, it would make it much easier to identify teammates in a hectic battle.  ""Do they look like you? If not, blast them!""
* Secondly, it would give players a chance to try out some skins without buying them.  Maybe some players who get assigned cuddle team leader would enjoy it so much they'd decide to buy it.
* Just imagine a hoard of Gingerbread men cresting a hill and charging your squad of teddy bears!  Who wouldn't enjoy that?

At the very least, just paint the t-shirts of the default skins red, blue, green, yellow, etc...  That would help.  I think the prospect of extra sales would be enough to justify letting players see the premium skins for a round or two.  ",FortNiteBR

Winrate vs Kills,"Winrate or Kills, which one matters more to the best player in the world? This discussion started between me and my friend. To me, wins is the thing that matters, but my friend insisted kills is what matters.

I argued that if the objective of a game is [X], then the one who is the best at doing [X] is the best player. His counterpoint was that community is what decides who is the best player in the game. Therefore the one who is looked at as the best, is the best.

Lets try a bit of a extreme example: One person has a 30% winrate but finishes each game with at least 10 kills, the other one has 40% winrate, but finishes each game with a maximum of 2 kills. My friend argued that no one would think of the one with the 2 kills as the best player, and I counter argued that it doesn't matter what people think.

This game does somewhat reward passive play and landing in safe areas and sticking to the outer edges of the circle will in most cases improve your winrate. Play smart or play good?

We pretty much agreed to disagree and the discussion didn't really go anywhere. What are your thoughts reddit? ",FortNiteBR

The main drawback seems to be a split user base. Nowadays, I don't think that will be any problem at all. Games fill instantly, and waiting a little longer on a 3 man team would be completely worth it for me. Additionally, 3 man team could be disabled on the quieter servers. 

A 3 man option gives 2 big oppertunities in my eyes: the first is the logical one, don't be in a disadvantage when there is only 3 players online at that moment. But a second one would be very welcome for me too, 3 mans are easier to manage communication wise, and would be a lot better to teach a new friend the game. Easier to carry a 3rd player, without the complete madness 4s can be. Teams of 3s is a lot of fun for me personally, and it doesn't get complete apeshit in chat etc. Fighting 3v4 all the time gets frustrating though. 

Any up or downsides on this I am missing? I hope Epic reads this and at least opens the dialogue on it. Seems quite ""easy"" to implement and a real quality of life upgrade for most.

We scampered for separate doors, where he grabbed a pistol and I grabbed a shield. As he took aim, I busted another move to stall him. When he stopped to dance back before killing me, I dropped him my shield potion and backed up. He was clearly confused at first, but I gave him more of a cushion and he eventually accepted my offer of friendship.

From there, we methodically worked our way through tilted, sharing loot and tearing through everyone we came across. I’m sure we’ve both been reported by everyone we killed lol. Unfortunately, my comrade was ultimately ambushed by a sneaky enemy with about 20 players left and I was not given an opportunity to revive him (duh, but still sad). I tried to win it for him, but barely cracked the top 10. Oh well.

Anyways, it was the most rewarding game I’ve had since my first win. My “diplomatic efforts” normally get me killed pretty quickly haha, but stuff like this makes it feel worth the effort sometimes.

I would like to make a small proposal for change that might make some people cringe, but that would also be a breath of fresh air for others. I've been playing at Fortnite since season two, mostly as a team, and I take my foot every day. Unfortunately, there is one aspect of the game that spoils the team experience a bit. The almost systematic massacre of my wounded teammates ... This greatly harms the experience and spoils the game for the player who is finished. Indeed, it often happens that we start the party to four and soon one of us dies by this practice and must watch the end of the game as a spectator.

So, my proposal would be to forbid killing a man on the ground. Already because ... it's violent as behavior. This makes players silly, because he wants more than everything to finish their opponent, instead of focusing on the rest of the team in front. It frustrates the person, but also his team that ends up without him.

It is obvious that by preventing that. We will meet more often with finals in 4v4, but is not it just a good thing for a final?

Of course, we must keep the possibility that the wounded can still die: by the storm, by loss of life over time.

One could imagine a system like on L4D:

1st dismount: we keep as it is.

2nd grounding: life decreases 2x faster.

3rd grounding: instant death.

You could use it on your enemies or your friends.  Heck, you could use it on yourself too.

Is this server side? 
Is this because the game can't handle that many people dropping into 1 location at once?
Is it console? 
Is it specifically Xbox?
Is it a bug?

The thing is, everything in game is fully loaded. Yet everyone is getting the lag.
Also, (very rarely) I have had a bit of lag landing somewhere else, yet it's always Tilted Towers.
I'm thinking the game can't handle 20vs20 mode to an extent.

Drop, lags the the entire way down

Lag off the side of the building

Find a chest, have to open it 3 times before it actually opens
Can’t pick up the items anyways

Try to build ramp to run up, lag-fall.
Shoot at someone, lag-skips backwards and says I never shot, even though I got hit markers.
Eventually lag-fall to my death or get killed point blank by enemies who don’t even appear on my screen yet.

Not a single aspect of the game works the way it’s suppose. Not dropping, mining mats, opening anything(doors/chests), building, shooting.. none of it works right. Not even the emotes, I’m only getting sound from emotes about 50% of the time now the rest of the time it’s just silent.

I just can’t do it anymore. I was planning on switching to PC soon anyways because I’m an Overwatch player, so I guess no more Fortnite until I make the switch.

I guess this is more of a vent than anything, and I understand the game really isn’t made for console. But I’m honestly curious how they can’t get just one aspect of the game to work properly.

It’s towards the end of the night for me, I’m getting super tilted at every death I experience, and I’m one tier away from unlocking the dark voyager skin. Problem is, I need 10 more stars to get it, and I have no intention of leveling up my character by staying up for several more hours. But I am determined to get my Dark Voyager skin before my head hits the pillow. I quickly realize that the only way it’s gonna happen is by completing the crossbow elimination challenge, and I am an actual pile of trash when it comes to using that weapon. But, my want to get the Dark Voyager outweighs my dislike of the crossbow. 

So, I drop into the next match and land in Retail Row. Before I land, I quickly spin my character around, checking to see how many others had made their way over. Lo and behold, i was all alone...in retail row...GOD DAMN RETAIL ROW! Taking the heaven sent gift, I loot up as much as I can, walking out of the town with 3 kills ( a few stragglers had made their way over and met an unfortunate fate at the hand of my green pump shotty), fully shielded, a purple SCAR, green pump, purple Tactical shotty, med kit, and a slew of minis. I was feeling really. After several minutes, I come across a purple Crossbow. Displacing my med kit, I hunt down the unfortunate soul who will fall victim to my arrows. 

Several more minutes pass before I spot a person. Sneaking up on him, I begin to hear gunshots, a clear sign that he had gotten into a vicious fight, the type of fight that leaves the victor with 30 health and no shields. I take this chance and begin making my way over to the area of the fight...and there he is right across from me. Kneeling underneath a small ledge at the top of a hill, he’s licking the wounds from his skirmish, applying a Med Kit out in the open. I pull out the cross bow, take slow and careful aim, send a quick prayer up to the heavens, and pull the trigger. DING! Headshot. The challenge is completed. The Dark Voyager is mine. At that point I didn’t even care if I didn’t get the Victory Royale. I had finally gotten what I wanted all this time. I loot up, replacing the crossbow with a rocket launcher and run towards the edge of the next zone. A short while later, I find myself in first place, claiming my third solo Victory Royale in over 1000 games. What a beautiful way to end the night. 

TLDR: I wanted the Dark Voyager skin, completed the crossbow kill challenge, won the game, and went to sleep a happy man. ",FortNiteBR

Shotguns are by far the easiest, cheapest, least skill required to get a kill in game. They absolutely demand to be ran EVERY single game, lest ye be rekt by one cause your shitty smg can not be bunny hopped and aimed accurately. I hate the fact that to play effectively you need to run the same exact load out every game. 

I dream of the day that I’m not just bum rushed with stairs and jumped on and around by a shotgun, only to die in 2-3 hits IF they don’t get the easy to hit headshot. You don’t have to ads like every other gun pretty much requires, you can jump like a mad man with 0 worries, you know all you have to do is get your crosshair right over the opponent. 

The double pump was a problem, but not the only problem with shotguns. Running pump and semi is damn near just as strong. Get the heavy hit of the pump then switch and spray

If you don’t believe shotguns are way to OP, I challenge you to run multiple games without one. Not saying this is impossible by any means, but I’m willing to be you lose a LOT more of your 1v1s not using a shotgun. oryouscared?

I don’t use a scuff and it’s still incredibly easy for me to remove my thumb from my stick for .1 seconds and then get back to aiming rinse and repeat. Now WITH a scuff? You are non stop aim jumping perfectly and it’s far easier to land these kills. 

Can anyone pull up statistics of shotgun use vs any other secondary? I bet shotgun kills would even out  number AR kills. No other gun matches the shear one shot power, unless you land a sniper headshot which is quite the feat to be able to do consistently. 

I would also ask that if you are going to downvote me, let me AND the community know why you are against this. If you agree with me, then please leave a quick comment as to why. 

I’m aiming for a healthy and fruitful debate that’s full of intellectual thought about the current meta of the game. If you have nothing nice or thought out to say, just leave your downvote lol. 

TO EPIC: I’d also really like to hear what you guys think about the current state of shotguns. Wether you agree or disagree with me. Any plans for shotguns in the future. 

Thanks

Edit: I don’t see why this has to be met with arrogance. Can’t we just debate about it, make a case, and agree to disagree if we can’t change the others mind. Why is it so hard to have a conversation? Lol cmon guys.

I mean, I don’t want to seem like I’m crying, I just want some honesty. Am I wrong? Are shotguns not the easiest gun in the game? Do they not demand to be ran? Do they not make other guns damn near worthless? Please tell me why then..

Not a meme or ninja and no one wants there easy kills taken so this doesn’t get talked about.. again:/ ",FortNiteBR

Not only does it give them the chance to get revived if you get killed but they can provide call outs the entire time they’re moving around.   I understand if they’re out in the open and you have to be fully exposed to finish them off but other than that instance there really isn’t a reason to keep them alive.

Recently my account was hacked, and I posted about it but nobody saw it/a bot took it down. Here's the previous post:  
&gt; PLEASE read this and give me some suggestion as to what to do. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I feel like I am being severely trolled right now. Heres what's going on:

&gt; Yesterday at about 6:30 pm, while I was away from my computer to go out to eat, I was logged out of Epic Games launcher because of another log-in, from a different location. As quickly as I could, at about 7 pm, I got on Epic Games and changed my password, enabled 2-step log in, and changed my e-mail password and took my PayPal off of my account. No charges were made thankfully, but the hacker did end up changing my password and linking his/her PSN, namely ""XBLDeagle."" I am in no way affiliated with this screen name, nor have I ever been, but even tonight I logged on to my skins changed and some more challenges completed (also namely, the play matches with friends challenge that would have stayed at 0/10 because I don't normally play with friends.) - even after I changed my password. No attempt has been made to change my password by the hacker a second time, but I don't understand what I'm doing wrong and how to get the hacker off of my account. The PSN is NOT mine, I can provide Epic with game logs, IP addresses, my MAC address, whatever! I just want this hacker off of my account, and nothing that I have tried that I would expect to work has been proven successful.

&gt; Can anyone help?

&gt; TL;DR: Epic account was hacked, hacker changed pass, etc. Didn't charge my account but played games instead, linked their PSN account, I enabled 2fa and changed all passwords ASAP, logged in the next day to an evident second entry from said hacker.

I have 2FA on, changed my password, linked my Google+ account so that I can log in through it, and yet **ALL LOG-INS FROM THE HACKER ARE NOT PROMPTING FOR A 2FA CODE.** I get logged out from games I'm in because they log in somewhere else. - In fact, I just got logged out 2 times in about 3 minutes on video. My skins were changed and everything. I'm completely baffled and I can't get him off of my account, can someone PLEASE help so I can get back to playing this game?  

Edit: Because of this post, Epic Games has responded and helped me out with my situation. Thank you reddit.",FortNiteBR

Everyone always asks: How do I get better at this game?  The answer isn't always as simple as ""Drop Tilted every match so you get better at gunfights.""  I love it when people suggest that you record your gameplay if possible, and analyze what you could have done differently, as I think that's a great strategy.

I'm here to tell you that as someone that started off as a pretty bad player and is slowly progressing into an above average one,  it is ALL ABOUT THAT CONFIDENCE.  I used to panic when I was being shot at, just praying to the RNG gods that I would get lucky and get the kill while expecting to die.

Now?  Every time I see a player, regardless of whether he has position on me, superior weaponry, etc., that player in my mind is about to have his game ended by yours truly.  Good players push and build.  I'm not talking about rushing when it's 1v4. Confidence, not recklessness.  What has helped me immensely is watching players like Ninja, Lupo, CDN, and so many others to see how they play and try to employ the same strategies but not trying to be exactly like them.

At the end of the day, it's Fortnite.  You're going to get killed in the most frustrating way possible pretty often.  If you truly want to get better, start in your head.  You'll soon notice that you don't get jittery, nervous, or scared when you find a fight or a fight finds you, and when you get down on yourself, just remember that there's over 3 million people playing this game.  There's bound to be SOMEONE worse than you. :)

Much love Fortnite fam!",FortNiteBR

Download something called NVIDIA GeForce NOW. This is a program that can stream games from a high end PC in the cloud to your own!

There is a wait list to get this, however. The wait is about a week.

If you have a bad processor, that’s ok. All you need is a good internet speed!

Required download speed is 15MBPS, but it is recommended to have 50&gt; MBPS for an incredibly smooth experience

This will let you play Fortnite on the highest possible settings on a $200 PC! 

I hope you find this helpful! :-D

We both suck and it’s a miracle we even made top 10. Even more of a miracle that the last circle didn’t end with some incredible build-off like I thought it would after seeing so many videos of that happening. 
Instead it was 3 people jumping and shotgunning each other in the middle of Anarchy Acres while I wandered behind a rock and managed to stumble upon a fourth guy watching them with a rocket launcher. Popped him in the back of the head with a hand cannon and took up his spot waiting for the fighting to end and then seized the opportunity to reward the survivor of said shotgun-palooza with a healthy dose of hand cannon as well. Netting my wife and I our first Victory Royale. 

My wife didn’t get a single kill and got downed before I made my way to the sacred rock of camping but I like to think buying her that pink bear outfit made her a distraction enough for me to take a few people out. Plus she made a few good call outs that saved our bacon. She’s in love with the game now though and can’t wait to play more. 

I think I got 4 kills? Every single one of them with that sexy ass hand cannon. I will never underestimate this thing again. The satisfaction of two-shotting people is unmatched.

1. He wont hold any meds. Bandages? Nope. Medkits? Nope. Small shields? Nope. Nothing. Whenever he is asked to stack a med he responds with, ""No, I'm not a little medic bitch."" Leaving the rest of the squad to carry more supplies and sometimes sacrifice inventory slots for extra meds.

2. He runs off on his own ALL THE TIME. Every game, he is running after a care package or stalking an enemy team without telling anyone else. To put this into perspective, we will land at lonely lodge and before we finish looting, he will be engaged in a fight in retail row.

3. He will only land at lonely lodge. Tower every time. If we try and go somewhere else, we will all go there but he will fly all by himself to the lodge and if we die first he wont quit.

4. He demands that if anyone gets an RPG, it goes directly to him. This is probably the most irritating of them all. He states, ""I'm the best with the RPG so if anyone finds it they need to give it to me."" He claims it as his own and if we refuse he will cut that person out and sometimes mute them. He also won't help that person if they ever need ammo or anything and will hog it which he already does in the first place!

I'm tyred to see the same daily items every day.

Where is the rarity? The price means the rarity of a skin? Nope.

I think that the rarity of items depends of the amount of skins in the market. 

Seeing again the Valentines' day skins (11/03) is so annoying, cause I bought the Cuddle Team Leader and I thought that it was little rare, inasmuch as it was bound to the event.

I cant feel the difference beetween legendary and common skins if the quantity of those are the same (everybody can purchase them).

Why dont you put the llamas like pve store? 

With crates, the community perceives the REAL difference between skins.

Here's a list of gamemodes that could be in the arcade:

&gt;1. 10v10 TDM in Tilted Towers (first to team 30 kills)

&gt;2. 5v5 TDM in Pleasant Park / Salty Springs / Lucky Landing / Retail Row / Greasy Grove (first to team 20 kills)

&gt;3. 20 player DM in Tilted Towers (last person standing)

&gt;4. 10 Player DM in Retail Row / Salty Springs / Retail Row / Greasy Grove (last person standing)

&gt;5. 3v3 Elimination TDM in Tomato Town / Factories / Lucky Landing / Shifty Shafts / Lonely Lodge / Containers

&gt;6. 1 player Sandbox (empty field, unlimited resources, access to all guns)

&gt;7. 2 Player Build Battle (empty field, 300 of each resource, 2 minutes to build, fight after 2 minutes)

These a few ideas that I put together, and would add another level of fun to FortNite. It would allow players to explore places, improve their combat without affecting their BR stats, improve their building ability, and take a break from the slow-paced, but intense, BR Gamemode. 

If you are unfamiliar with some of the terms, TDM means Team Death Match, DM means Death Match, Elimination TDM is a TDM but you don't respawn if you die. 

Thoughts? I'm open to suggestions!

**EDIT:** Only two of these gamemodes would be open at a time, rotating every 48 hours.",FortNiteBR

How boring is that?” Agree or disagree?,"Certainly feels that way. Build, close the distance, then jump shot with a shotgun to victory. It also feels like everybody almost always has a full shield whenever I get into gun battles.

Don’t even get me started with the hit reg. I keep reading about “bloom” on here and understand it now. But man, it’s just incredibly frustrating shooting in this game. I’ve seen people post their own footage of missing shots that looked to be SPOT ON, yet didn’t hit once, and just get shotgunned down. I can totally relate. Yeah, I lose gun battles. But, when you don’t even get a single hit marker? It leaves me scratching my head. 

I love this game and love playing with my friends again. It’s been a while since we’ve found a game that we all truly enjoy playing together. But not knowing where my bullets are going, and constant jumping shotgun battles has been driving me crazy lately playing this game lately.


Anybody else feel this way and agree/disagree with Doc?

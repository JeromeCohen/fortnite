Don’t have the exact numbers on me; if this thread gets enough attention I’ll find them. But the base damage of GREEN/BLUE is 26/27 respectively yielding 52/54 in the head. A GOLD suppressed pistol does that, and the drum gun is automatic. This essentially renders many other weapons in the game useless, there’s just no place for a suppressed pistol, pistol, tactical, or suppressed SMG anymore. A GREEN drum gun does more DPS than a purple tactical sub machine gun, destroys a fully built wall nearly 2 seconds quicker. The GREEN drum gun quite literally has a higher DPS than a gold scar; why is it green? I’m absolutely stunned that this weapon is so powerful to be green and blue and so commonly found. This weapon revamps the entire way the game is played, why even use an AR anymore? Build a couple walls, close distance on your opponent and use the drum gun which has a decent range, and is incredibly powerful; all with a 50 round magazine. This weapon throws off gun balance in the game entirely and the fact that it’s so commonly found makes this game closer and closer to call of duty. I’d like to hear some of your opinions, professional players today in tournaments are beginning to shy away from ARs in order to carry Drum Gun, double pump, a heal and a long range weapon. I have played Call of Duty competitively and understand gun balance; this should not have been implemented, or at least with this kind of power. The fact I haven’t seen a thread on this is absolutely astonishing.",FortNiteBR

Says 

&gt;New Wild West Heroes

For context, Season 4 had the heroes/villains (Movies) theme in BR and in Save the World they released Blockbuster Heroes. 

Highly likely that S5 in Battle Royale will also be Wild West/historic.

**More supporting evidence:**

The hanging photograph in Retail Row's detective agency is a desert map, this building popped up in Retail last update.

The Tweet from @TwoEpicBuddies also shows a wagon, bones, etc that were leaked, all coinciding with STW's May 2018 event desert biome, which again goes with the Wild West theme. [Image](https://imgur.com/a/b8X4Mff). One of these things is expected to pop from the Greasy Grove portal.

I have a screenshot of the post just in case Epic realizes they spoiled it early and delete the post, link to actual post is given below.

STW and BR always had concurrent events, like BR had movies theme and STW had ""Blockbuster Event"". Both had the comet, in general the storylines are going in the same direction.

In a Roadmap to future updates, Epic just confirmed that V 5.0 is going to have ""Wild West"" heroes in STW. The theme of Season 5 is DEFINITELY going to be something related to that.

After all the blood, sweat, and throwing the controller across the room, I finally did it! The grind for level 80 is complete and it feels so good. I am one of those lucky souls that has the ability to AFK mobile at work. With that in mind, about 21 days left before the end of season I decided that I would grind from level 50 to 80. Was that a stupid idea? Heck ya! Am I sick of the game? Absolutely!!! Will I do this next season? FOR SURE! I like the idea about grinding for exclusive content and it honestly does not bother me that much because I came from MMOs but hopefully they lower the level requirement or lower the EXP to get to level 80. 

And for some words of wisdom... For those who are so close to making it and are burnt out like me. We are almost there! Keep fighting through pain because achieving your goals feels so much better then not getting them.

Best of luck to all!

That being said I absolutely hate how it effects the rest of the games colors. Even with it on 4 it still dulls every other color in the game making it look like fallout. On top of that when it is night time (in game)  I often miss players that are right infront of me due to the colorblind mode. It really takes away from me being able to enjoy the game as I literally cannot play without it on but when I put it on it makes skins that look good look bad. There needs to be a way for the color blind mode to only effect the rarity colors and icons. Like in PUBG and League of Legends, the color blind mode only effects certain aspects that are critical to the game such HP bars, player icons, and indicators rather than changing the color scheme of every aspect in the game.   


I've added an image of the side by side comparison with 10 Deuteranope vs nothing. It also really effects the lights on Omega making blue the only interesting style. 

.  TL;DR I wish there was a setting for color blind mode for only items and cosmetic icons rather than tweaking the color of everything in the game

We had a tremendous amount of positive support from our first post, and all of us working on this project are extremely grateful for the great community response. This is a passion project for us, and we’ve had a lot of sleepless nights to deliver SCOUT for ourselves and for the Fortnite community.  

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks to you, we now have an active Discord and tons of people reaching out to offer help, see how they can get involved, and just overall excited to have SCOUT start matching them with Fortnite teammates while helping us grow the AI behind the app. 

&amp;nbsp;

That being said, I’m excited to let everyone know that our beta has officially been approved by both Apple and Google! What does this mean? It means you can download the first version of the SCOUT beta RIGHT NOW!

&amp;nbsp;

As I mentioned before, the app will be free for beta and official release, and the more you use it to find your Fortnite teammates, the better the matching logic will become for you and the entire community.  

&amp;nbsp;

Because of all the support this community has given us, we’ve opened additional slots to get more people into the beta and start finding better teammates.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Here’s how to get your hands on the first beta version of SCOUT:

&amp;nbsp;

*If you’re on Android, here’s the Google Play Store direct download link: android.joinscout.gg ←- will take you directly to the Google Play Store download


*If you’re on iOS, you’ll need to sign up at https://www.joinscout.gg. This is because Apple’s TestFlight provides all testers a unique email redemption code to safely install the beta through their Testflight app. We’ll be sending new invites out daily.

&amp;nbsp;

IMPORTANT: While you’ll be able to download the app now and check it out, SCOUT’s actual matchmaking window officially opens up for the first time later TODAY (July 6th) between the hours of **5pm-11pm CST**, so be sure to turn on your notifications and make sure you’re online to match and play! Testing will include PS4, XB1, and PC. **Mobile and Switch support will land in the future.**

&amp;nbsp;

PS: SCOUT is in beta, so keep in mind that we’re expecting bugs. You can report these bugs either directly through TestFlight/Google Play, or preferably through our feedback channel in our Discord. We also have a Bug Submission form found here: feedback.joinscout.gg. You can join the Discord from our site (or here https://discord.gg/abTgghQ). We’ll be in constant communication with everyone in the Discord and give opportunities for all of you to help make important decisions going forward. We’ll also be updating the app during beta frequently based on your feedback!

&amp;nbsp;

Also, as a thank you for building SCOUT with us, users that are actively using the app to match and find teammates with will be eligible for V-Bucks giveaways throughout the beta.

&amp;nbsp;

We’re so excited to get this off the ground, and even more excited to start matching today with all of you! See you on the Battle Bus!

This season I felt like the skins weren’t too crazy but the special events and things players taught epic can help them so much for next season. So many great suggestions this season. I’m not trying to steal anyone’s shine but I would love to see what most people suggested like:

- Better exp solos
- Animated Loading Screens
- Pickaxe Back Bling
- Playground update and permanent mode
- Spray that show kills, skins, name
- Pick up a basketball n shoot
- Art designed mats (like wood would have blood on it or graffiti, some sort of designs) 
- Legendary skins come with: backbling, loading screen; glider n axe come separately. 
- Building sensitivity on consoles! Buttons remap
- FOUNDERS EDITION BETTER SKIN AND UMBRELLA. We been waiting since season 2. Or maybe I’ll very own shop with exclusive skins... something!
- More special events like the rocket. 
- Bring back factories (personal suggestion) that big crater in the middle of the map was lame. 
- Choose between different default skins
- Level 100 skin (not tiers)
- More challenges that unlock either skins or gun camos
- Gun skins/Camos
- Better victory royale finishing screen
- One button edits on console, no more holding circle
- Be able to edit more skins like the omega and carbine.
- Be able to build on edges of buildings or shacks
- More players in playground mode
- Death chat, when killing someone you hear their voice for 2 seconds. I used to love this in games hearing enemies die!
- Bush to the vault...
- Outfit presets
- Death animations
- More jump pads in games. It should be a bit more common. Many games where the last team had high ground and no way to get up to them camping. 
- No more mouse and keyboard on consoles. 
- Suggestions to turn off certain challenges, for example the gnomes laughing or the rings in the sky. I no longer need challenges so I hate seeing this things or hear them.
- Remove stickers, maybe make them sprays

Last but not least my very last suggestion and probably not possible.

I love playing solo ques or duo ques with friends. Either make a custom lobby with friends or make it where you get in friend lobbies easier... now the problem with that is players will probably team up and try to kill the whole lobby, me and my friends try to win the game every time fighting each other if we make it to the end.  I don’t know how to perfectly execute this plan but on GTA when you search a random lobby, usually your friends that you never play with are in the same lobby and it creates competition. ",FortNiteBR

~%The Beginning%~
———————————
I think 90% of us think that Getting 3 kills in Fatal Fields is too easy. I think we need harder weekly challenges getting 3 kills should be a daily challenge. The point of the weekly challenge is to take around a week to complete. Here are some ideas I came up with. 
___________________________________________
~%Search 25 Chests In Unnamed Locations%~
————————————————————————-
(This forces players to move away from high traffic areas and explore new areas maybe they haven’t seen before)

_______________________________________________
~%Kill 25 Enemies in (Random Location per player)
——————————————————————————
(Also here is another example I believe when Epic wants us to kill a certain amount of people in an area I think it should give people random locations so we don’t have half the lobby at risky reels or Junk junction as seen in this week and last week.)

Last One

_________________________[______________________
~%Eliminate A Enemy With a Sniper from 200m%~
——————————————————————————
(This would make the challenges more fun and more challenging by forcing players to pick and choose their kills based on a challenge)

Thank You For Reading This Far!

TL:DR
———

I hate the current stage of weekly challenges they are too easy. I would like to see more diverse challenges like kill an enemy with a sniper for 100m or 200m.
Weekly challenges should take longer and be harder to do BUT you should receive more EXP in the long Run. (GO BACK UP AND READ LAZY ASS)

And for the most part, a better game. I can't believe how much has changed in just a month and a half.

Pump Shotgun nerf: long overdue, I think shotgun supremacy was straight up ruining the game. You still occasionally run into people running double pump/heavy but the frequency is reduced. Tactical shotgun feels more viable now. Shotguns are still the most powerful weapons in the game, but not by as wide a margin. Positive change.

Building/llama nerf: net positive change. With resources more precious fights are actually fights again, not massive boring build-offs. Edit peaking is gone, and even though I used it this is still a positive change for the health of the game.

Rocket ammo nerf: very positive change for the final circles, and necessary when paired with the building material nerf. Before the nerf you never knew if the enemy lucked across a llama and has fifty rockets to send your way. Now you know whether or not you'll be able to weather the storm based on your material supply. Encourages careful use of ammo and reduces explosive spam. Positive change.

C4 buff: wow, a hard counter to buildings that isn't overpowered against players. Long overdue, positive change.

Gas grenades: haven't gotten to really use them yet so I don't know how useful they are. Anyone put these to good use?

Smg/silenced smg buff: almost as impactful as the shotgun nerf. Viability raised across the bar, and bridges the short/medium range bracket much more effectively than before. Taking a silenced smg over an equivalent rarity assault or burst rifle is now a viable choice if you want to force fights at a range beyond effective shotgun range but inside ideal assault rifle range. Very positive change.

Dual pistols: interesting addition, solid short range firing cone, but I'm just not accurate enough for them to be worth it over shotguns. Fun to use, but don't fit my playstyle. Feels like a more versatile hand canon. Positive addition. I'd love to hear what other people think of these.

Thermal scoped rifle: this thing is a beast! 70 damage headshots and target illumination means you can plonk people at almost any range, but you do have to expose yourself to do it. This fills the DMR role better than either the scoped assault or semi auto sniper. Also gives limited visibility through wood walls. I think this thing is maybe sleeper op, and I wonder if it shouldn't be using large bullets instead of medium. But for now I'd put it just behind the bolt action and on a level with the blue hunting rifle in terms of effectiveness. The scope has a small windup time for balance, which is both smart and somewhat true to life if you're familiar with using thermal optics or cameras. I thought that was a nice touch.

Semi auto sniper: wait, nope. Still a pile of crap.

Drum gun: hoo boy, this is what the lmg wishes it was. Excellent at close-medium range and absolutely shreds players and structures at point blank. You can use this thing to break into forts with enough ammo to kill the defender or defend against double ramp aggression. It's the only gun I'd feel comfortable saying can be taken * in place of* a shotgun. Looks, sounds, and feels great. Very positive addition. Probably my favorite new gun.

Lmg and mini gun buffs: haven't gotten to use the lmg since I've been back, but I've killed a few people with the mini gun and it feels like it's in a better place, if still not viable for solo. Positive change.

Trap nerf/buff: I think the buff was a bit overkill. Traps were in a perfect spot before, and rewarded clever placement and leaving bait. I think we'll see more fiddling with this.

Shopping cart: these things are a blast, but can be annoying to push uphill. Interesting change, not sure if it was a positive one.

Week 5-10 challenges: meh, continuing the trend of goals that are more frustrating than challenging for the most part. Would like to see something like ""get kills with 3 different weapon types in a single game"" or ""kill a player who has done 50 or more damage to you"" next season. Things like that are more fun than ""Google between a bear, a bench, and a donut"" or ""find an infograph with seven hungry gnomes"". It's nice that progress is updated on your screen though.



Overall: I think epic has done a good job leveling the playing field between different weapons and supporting play styles other than 'just build lol'. Now you can counter building with c4 and drum guns, defend against ramp aggression, disengage from fights for better position with bounce pads, and use silenced smgs at medium range. You never have to worry about endless rocket spam or being one-pumped anymore, and fight with (and against) a much larger variety of weapons and tactics. Every fight no longer ends in a double pump build-off. Almost all the changes and additions were good for the overall health of the game. Semi auto sniper still needs some love. Twitch streamers will still dunk on you until they find another game to ruin and move on, but I think the meta currently is in the best shape it's been in since season 2. Things are looking super positive heading into season 5 and I'll be sticking around and probably continuing to make videos here and there when I have time.",FortNiteBR

A while ago, I posted about how I believed that Switch players required more Season time in order to achieve all unlocks, especially the Omega Lights. I did not think it was possible to achieve this unlock for people who had only ever played on the Switch due to us only having 30 days from launch to the Season's end. I was told by many people that it was impossible to reach level 80 due to a lack of time. I work full time and go to the gym every day for about two hours. I only have weekends to grind and a few hours on weekdays, and I felt sorry for myself and found this to be unfair.

I was able to reach the level 80 unlocks through grinding and being diligent. There were times that I felt the burn of the grind, but I still made it without putting in an unreasonable amount of time. And I had less than HALF the time that most everyone else did to do it.

If I can make it to level 80 in my situation, then nobody else has any excuse to complain. I now see that we have all had the chance to do it and it only requires determination and skill. To those who say that it is time-based, you can only really make that argument if someone has had an enormous amount of time to play. I haven't. It obviously isn't time-based in my situation and in most other's. It might be for some, but they're arguably an insignificant minority who are negligible in this situation.

So yeah, it's possible for me. It's possible for you. That's all.",FortNiteBR

**Heres the stupid part by the intruder:**he added a few of his friends on my account, and i joined a lobby through his friend. To my amazement, i found the person who intruded my account, the exact same username that he changed it to. I questioned what happened, why he did it, his friend tried to cover for him but the intruder simply responded ""it was easy"" and left.

Ive sent a report to epic via their support email, i was wondering if somehow i could get an epic member staff through here to look into this at all, it would be some great reassurance. I have evidence through photos and video if required, which i've kept out of this post to prevent witch-hunting. 

So i ask, is it possible if i could get into contact with an actual person from EPIC, it would be extremely appreciated.

20 V 20 should STAY, it is a fun game mode and brings about more challenge to new players.

No, not even vertically.","I've seen too much arguing over this new ramp, pyramid, ramp, jump, pyramid, ""fast high-ground"" method, so I'm making a post showing that it is factually not faster, no, not even upward.

This can effectively be boiled down to 5th grade geometry, or maybe even earlier, I don't remember exactly.
Basically both of these techniques achieve 1 block elevation over 1 block length, or if you want to do it in place, two 1/2 block jumps per 1 block height.

If you don't believe me based on text, look at the linked images, (https://imgur.com/a/BZMMKMd) and see for yourself, the angle of elevation in the push is identical, while the shorter more vertical build looks like I just took 2 screenshots of the same thing, because I placed a pyramid in the background to guide my crosshair.

Now you might say that I didn't include every single scenario this could be used in, but considering the fact that a pyramid is just a 
1/2 block high piece, it is easy to recognize that it literally is as useful as half a ramp, therefor this entire post is just explaining the obvious.

I can safely and objectively state, that this technique is simply, more difficult, flashier and maybe as an actual advantage, more confusing to play against.",FortNiteBR

Skins are the center of this discussion as there is a conflating of skill and skins. Plenty of players want their skins to remain rare for the sake of giving them something to feel unique amongst the crowd. For some it's the Ghoul or Skull Trooper. For others it is the \*\*\* K.

**The emergence of ""OG"":** Early on in Fortnite, people were skeptical of the game's long term success. People expected PUBG to be the genre defining title and that it would survive longer. People who played a lot during Seasons 1 and 2 are the ones who backed the right horse. Near the end of Season 2 in Fortnite is where things in PUBG went south. The Xbox debacle, the 1.0 debacle, the constant netcode issues, Miramar was a bust, rubberbanding, poor connections, server crashes, poor performance, etc. Around January-February is when the mass migration started. Lots of those people were reticent to spend any money on a battle royale game due to being recently burned by PUBG so many opted to not buy the Battle Pass nor to buy any cosmetics. Because of this game's skillset being different than PUBGs, new players were getting trounced by more experienced ones. Black Ks struck fear into players due to their higher skill levels from having played the game for months earlier. Now to the ""OG"" mentality. This ultimately stems from feeling engaged enough in the game to be willing to spend money on cosmetics and how this was a sign of experience in the future. Players who spent money on Ghoul Trooper or Skull Trooper were committed to the game early on. They got early cosmetics when the game was still in its infancy. The influx of players in the game led to a portion of the original playerbase to feel entitled and superior to those who had just joined. In reality, they were just hipsters, but we now see an emergence of the ""OG"" mentality. It stems from the constant ""Flexing"" you see from popular youtubers today, where they show off their wealth or status to younger viewers. These same viewers are now trying to emulate these actions in areas of their lives where they see some form of superiority. In this case, lots of ""OG"" players are young kids who feel entitled to flexing their early engagement in Fortnite.

**Experience:** Experience in a game is not indicative of skill alone. But rather, a player who is more experienced has the opportunity to reach a higher skill level comparative to players with less experience.  More time spent in the game means you will reach a higher skill level relative to how you played when you had little to no experience. Thus players who have a skin like Black K/John Wick/Omega are experienced. Not necessarily good, but experienced. With the Black K, its legacy is notable because it was only obtained by those prior to the huge surge in Fortnite's popularity at the beginning of Season 3. As such new players were getting trounced by more experienced players, many of whom wore the Black K skin. Those players have continued to play and remained experienced. The same can be said for John Wick players. The only skin which is going to remain rare and be an indication of how long you have played is any skin in the Season 2 Battle Pass. ALL other skins will be common. John Wicks were relatively common near the end of Season 3. Omegas are now becoming common. Omega with full lights will likely still maintain some rarity given its difficulty/grind in being obtained. All bought skins will inevitably return to the store. Skull Trooper, Ghoul Trooper, Power Chord, \*\*\* K, Yuletide Ranger, Nog Ops, etc. will all return to the shop and when they do, [the salt will be everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0). The ONLY skins which will remain rare are The Black K (Due to requiring lv.70 during season 2, before the huge influx of players) and Renegade Raider which was only available for purchase in Season 1 by reaching lv.20.

**The True ""Skilled"" Skin:** Now, Omega with full lights is a different beast. The skin required you to reach Battle Pass Tier 100 AND Season lv.80. Everyone with the BP can reasonably attain the BP Tier 100. But, Season lv.80 is a result of getting tons of XP. That XP isn't necessarily a direct result of skill, but it CAN be. The XP being gained by skilled players is higher than that of less skilled players due to having higher win rates, more kills, and higher placements in matches. Thus they would be gaining far more XP in a shorter amount of time. Less skilled players would have to grind an insane amount of time in order to get the skin. Ultimately an Omega with full lights is no matter what experienced. Either they grinded their asses off and are mediocre, or they didn't have to stress that much about it and unlocked it through normal amounts of play and are highly skilled. Omega, while a more common skin than The Black K, is a better indicator of skill and experience in a lot of ways. An Omega with lights is an indication that they either have plenty of wins and have been trouncing the competition or that they have poured an inordinate amount of time into this game and have a higher chance of being a good player.

**TL;DR**: People want to equate skill to their skins and the rarity of their skins ties into that. The ""skill"" associated with these skins mostly stems from those players having more experience either via having played the game early on, before its popularity surge, or by spending a lot of hours in the game. Experience allows those players to potentially be more skilled, thus we perceive the people who have those ""rare"" skins as being more skilled. Black K, John Wick, and Omega are all signs of hours poured into the game. Skull Trooper, Ghoul Trooper, \*\*\* K, Nog Ops, Yuletide Ranger, and Gingerbread are all signs that they were a part of the game at a certain point and bought a skin, thus signalling that they are experienced and have played over a longer time period.",FortNiteBR

If shifting from shotgun-meta was the intention, then Duel Pistols are a step towards the right direction. They hit just as hard as the shotguns, requires a bit more aim to deal damage, and have longer ranges. I would say the Duel Pistols are more of a direct counter to shotguns than the SMGs. The only problem with it right now is that they are Epic/Legendary items, which makes them harder to find.

That said, once you have the Omega skin, you should be able to unlock everything for it, even if it takes awhile.

I'm a decent player, and I play probably 5-6 games a day on average, and I usually win 1 or 2 of those. My K/D is somewhere between 2.4-3.2 depending on how I'm playing on a given day. The point is that I'm a pretty decent player - not amazing, but not horrible. I've also put plenty of time in to finish my battle pass as well as every weekly challenge, so I feel I earned my Omega skin.

That all being said, I'm only level 63. I find it hard to believe that anyone working full time with kids has the time required to make it to level 80 considering xp-wise i'm only 45ish% of the way there.

Here's my suggestion: Change the Omega skin upgrades, as well as any skin upgrades in the future to use an xp-based upgrade system instead of the current level-based one, and make it so the challenges don't expire at the end of the season. For example, make the chestpiece require 500k XP earned while using the skin, and go down from there. This will make it so that if you want to upgrade the skin, you have to use it, while still giving a sense of pride and accomplishment to those that do unlock it. In addition, it makes it so that the upgrades are always accessible, as long as you get the base skin unlocked within the current season. It should still be difficult, but not impossible to unlock.",FortNiteBR

But there is the downside... Please Epic, don’t be so ruthless next season. It is a risk I would have to stop playing at all if it continues like this.

Hello!

Yesterday I wanted to play FortniteBR, so I went to play on solo and game kick out me from match because I have problem with VPN or cheats ( I don't have both). I ignored that and started next match in which I had the same problem.

So I logout from Epic Games Launcher and wanted to login again but I got statement which says:

### Sorry, your account is inactive and may not login.

After that I sent so many tickets to Epic Games Suppport

All my tickets were about I didn't cheat and I didn't use VPN to have advantage in game. I said if They don't believe let's check my replays and look how I can't hit guy with the shotgun.

What Epic Games Support said?

**Bans are only issued if they are rightfully warranted and in the spirit of keeping our games fun and safe for everyone. For these reasons, we do not lift or overturn any bans.**

But problem is I didn't cheat and didn't use VPN in Fortnite.

Now I have problem with Epic Games Support because they doesn't read messages about my problem. They just ignore my message, opening rewrites.pdf and copy paste to my ticket.

I can't play Fortnite because I can't login to my account. I can't talk with Epic Games Support because they only copy paste on my tickets. So I came here. May You guys to publicize this situation.

Sorry for my english.

The first thing is Never ramp rush with a wall in front because it takes too much time and wastes mats.  you gotta remember it’s to not always good to take the high ground. In some situations your better off behind a rock or under a tree. 

Also don’t play on console or pc, you have to play on mobile with a wireless keyboard because everyone on there is noobs. Also if you have a friend playing on Nintendo switch join his servers.

Farm metal!! Metal has the most health in the game and is the best for any combat situations. Always double ramp with metal.

Don’t waste time farming. You gotta get a quick 100 mats and get the rest of your Mats off kills.

Always peek from the left because it’s harder to see from the right. 

Lastly play on a really low sensitivity so you can aim better don’t go above 4 or else u can’t aim good and you can still build just as fast as good players.

I could talk about an almost endless amount of things but I'll be talking about the following today,

**Nerfed weapon mechanics,**

**Nerfed character movement/crosshair movement,**

**Lower performance. With what is in my opinion, less visual fidelity with the illusion of better graphics,**

**Patch v4.5 and the Hotfix patch to fix the memory leak issue,**

**and finally missing elements to the patch notes which I see on a regular basis.**

I'm   going to give a quick run down on some of my gaming experience to give  a  general idea of my age and what sort of gaming background I come  from.  This I believe, will on some level at least, give you an  understanding  of the countless hours I've put into gaming and some of  the things I've  achieved over the nearly two decades that I've played  competitive games  and the experience and knowledge that comes with  that.  I'm not gonna go  super into detail because I'd like to keep the  topic based on Fortnite  and nothing else.

**Skip:** If you don't care about my previous experience in competitive games.

My   first serious game was Counter-Strike 1.6, which I moved too from   Counter-Strike 1.5. I then moved to WoW in the level 70 days. From   season 2 to 8, I achieved a range of Gladiator titles on my Warlock/Mage   and in season 8, I got rank one with a W/L of 187 to 4 in 5v5 Arena. I   believe it was the best Win/Loss ratio in WoW 5's at the time. I then   quit WoW and played Bloodline Champions, got rank 1 in solo queue at my   peak and then quit to move to League. I played League for nearly 2-3   years on and off, achieving Diamond 2 at my peak as Riven. I then played   H1Z1 BR in it's early days and would regularly get rank 1 on the daily   kills leaderboard. When H1Z1 started dying and became unplayable, I   moved to Overwatch, achieving top 500 and I think my peak rank was 187   while maining Tracer and Zarya. I Then played PUBG when it got popular   and would frequently get high kill games but due to the clunk and low   fps aids, I quit and moved to **Fortnite**BR.

So we're finally at the point I'm actually gonna talk about **Fortnite**.

**Nerfed Weapon Mechanics And Damage.**

When   Fortnite started getting popular, around 7-8 months ago. The game   itself, was almost flawless, the only thing we really needed was minor   bug fixing and a huge re-balance and design of the Riffles/SMGS in the   game. Shotguns however, the most controversial type of weapin in game,   had an almost pleasurable accuracy to them while being incredibly high   skill cap, allowing you to pull off some really interesting clutches and   great 1v4 team fights. Double pumping was not only fine at it's peak,   it was an accidental Godsend... Now for people who argue it was   unbalanced or OP, how is it that I would RARELY die to anyone? Even   teams of 4 players using double pumps themselves. It would be a   laughable joke, I'd hop around with the smooth movement and literally 1   tap flick shot everyone, the game had SUCH a high skill ceiling that I   could consistently kill teams of 4, on my own, without taking any dmg.   When you reduce the close combat gun dmg and lower the skill ceiling,   you make it so that whenever I try to jiggle peak or bunny hop 1 tap   someone, I can't.... I literally cannot 1 tap someone, this means in 0.5   to 1 second time frame it takes me to kill someone, it now takes up to   2-3 seconds! Giving the enemy I'm trying to kill an opportunity to do   dmg to me in return.. Which is fucking ridiculous given the fact I   outplayed the said enemy and managed to get my headshot off first. not   only is that an issue, you then have the 3 remaining players of his team   pushing u and shooting you, if u remove my ability to kill people in   split seconds, BECAUSE I'M GOOD ENOUGH TO DO SO. You remove any ability   to do amazing things or have any real fun with the possibility of   exceptional outcomes.  Not only have they lowered the dmg of shotguns,   they've reduced the range/spread in a way that makes it extremly   unaccurate and very rng. I can understand where Epic are coming from, I   really can.. The average player is not very good, AT ALL... The less   than average player is fucking terrible, I'd kill 25-35 of these players   in EACH of my games... No bullshit lol, it was actually hilarious and   fun tbh. Now, if I can jump down on a team of 4 people who are not very   good, hop around in their face while flick shot and 1 tapping them,  they  might -

**A**. Think I am Cheating

**B**.   Get annoyed they're not as good and blame the ""DOUBLE Pump"" Even  though  4/4 players of said enemy team were using them. The Logic of  some  people huh?

**C**.   Think the game is unbalanced and broken. Do you know why they might   think this? Games over the last 5 years all share a common trend. They   release, they do good for a while and then they die.. Two good examples   of this are H1Z1 and PUBG. Because they listen to a load of idiots from   the community who have NO IDEA what they're talking about, the people   who are lowering the skill ceiling of gaming. They then change the core   gameplay mechanics to suit these players and then a game dies. Now for   some of you reading this, sadly.. You are that average &amp;#37; in which ruin   things, because instead of taking the time to get better,  You  complain  and essentially force the games you're playing to become lower  in skill  level, so that it requires less effort to actually become  talented at  said game.. This is a big problem!

**My   Most Simple Argument Would Be: If Shotguns and the game was so   unbalanced why did it get so fucking popular in the first place?**

The   reason is; because the game had the right stuff, ""The Right   Ingredients"". It was balanced and designed by what I'd hope to be   experienced game creators, who knew what they were doing at the core   level. Given the fact they might of intended on changing the weapon   balancing, I believe there's a reason they left the core gameplay and   the dmg on guns the same for so long, before giving into the crying   majority of children and teens who don't like to be killed by clearly   better players. Amazing things can come from something not intended at   all. Sometimes, amazingly fun game mechanics can arise from something   not planned at all.  Just because something wasn't intended doesn't mean   it's wrong, or unbalanced.. why 8 months down the line has it been   COMPLETELY changed, the shotguns mainly, but also every little detail of   the game has changed for the worse. Weapon Delay/ Low Shotgun Dmg/ Bad   Hit Reg, Terrible Player and Enemy movement, and the list goes on. The   only positive thing Epic does is add new skins/events, but they've   ruined the core code of the game. I guess Rifles are better than they   used to be. WIPPY!!!! I can now sit and camp with only my **forehead**   showing while my Rifle shoots through objects, giving my enemy no   chance of return fire......?!?!?!? So much Funzies! Camping like a try   hard and getting annoyed when u die to high dmg guns because you got   outplayed is krink, being try hard doesn't represent talent or skill.   Please Trust me on this. If you put the work into getting good at a game   that requires a high level of skill, your brain learns things, adapts   to situations you thought never before winnable, what you once thought   was unbalanced becomes more balanced than you'll ever know, relying on   pure skill and gamesense. **Fortnite** is losing this with every patch and it breaks my heart.

**Movement Mechanics.**

Like   in all of the competitive and fun games I've played, movement of your  character is SUPER important. Movement needs to be snappy, responsive   and not limit the rhythm in which your character can move at. Playing  games at a high level and doing crazy big plays, requires a certain   level of momentum.. rhythm as it were, if u remove this or make it   clunky you essentially force the player into a specific and limited play   style, which may not suit them specifically, not allowing the player  to  fully flurish.

It's very hard to  explain  this one as I need to show you with actual footage side by  side. But  imagine, while trying to run from room to room, loot to loot,  you want  to be able to keep your momentum and rhythm while not having  to slow  down to achieve turns/picking up items and kills u might get.  It makes  for a slow and clunky feel to the movement, if u run into a  room to loot  and then want to turn around and keep your rhythm.. it's  almost  impossible to do so without your character coming to a complete  stop and  then having to build up momentum again, It also forces people  to spam  Jump instead of investing in good player movement. It never  used to be  like this! It's hard to explain in words, but TRUST me, the  movement is  fucking HORRIBLE and has slowly changed to simply work  better for the  CONSOLE version. Obviously, using controllers over MICE  makes for a  difference in the speed of which u move your crosshair and  character, so  they've changed the Animations to best suit Console.  However.. There's  even some sort of weird mouse acceleration I haven't  been able to get used too or explain properly to myself for some time..  Clunky movement also effects aim, as a lot of good players use the  momentum of movement to build up to flick/swing shots. If the enemy is  moving in an  inpredictable and laggy fassion due to bad movement  mechanics it creates  a generally less fun fighting experience and  effects skill level and  makes for a more RNG outcome.. I'm not sure why  they would do this but  I'm guessing Epic are aware of this and keep it  as such to keep the  skill ceiling from raising too much again.

**Performance and Visuals.**

This   is highly Subjective. If u compare gameplay and screenshots of the   early versions of Fortnite BR you'll find it has much more lighting,   atmosphere and background sound, just minor enough for it not to be   annoying. I feel when I play Fortnite now I have no sense of being, no   sense of place... I just feel like I'm running around a map with grass   that renders as I'm running with horrible and dull lighting with no   immersion. Even though, to me personally the graphics look worse. I now   run Fortnite on the lowest possible settings at around half the fps I   used to get on average. How is that even possible, nerfed Player   animations and generally more clunky gameplay with worse lighting and on   top of that lower fps? Wtf is Epic doing.... Even the Field of   View/Distancing feels different and out of place.

**Patch v4.5, The Hotfix Patch For The Memory Leak.**

When   patch v4.5 came out the other day. I downloaded it, played it and was   INSANELY surprised, movement felt a bit better, fps was higher again,   they'd made it ever so slightly faster to double pump again, tacticals   felt better, HIT registry was very good and they'd clearly changed   shotgun spread and range. I was running around Tilted, cleanly 2  shotting  every player I saw with either double pump, or pump tactical.  95&amp;#37; of my  shots were hitting for full dmg and enemy player movement  felt easier to track with less clunk, a side from the memory leak which I  was getting badly... The game itself felt like it had taken a turn for  the  better, like they'd gone back in a time machine 6-7 months. The  next day I woke up and noticed they'd released a new patch to address  the memory  leak issues. Lo and behold when I patched and came back to  play, it  felt clunky and my fps had dropped by half again, my shotguns  were  acting slow and shitty again, movement felt slow and I was back to   struggling to kill average players. They kept the killfeed changes and  a  few other things but completely reverted the core changes they made  to  make it feel smooth and high skill cap again. I went from feeling no   irritation and killing everyone and everything again to struggling to   kill a group of children playing on Mobiles lol. I myself even question   how the feel of the game can change so drastically with changes most   people wouldn't even notice.

**Missing Info In Patch Notes**.

100&amp;#37;   they changed the range and shotgun spread in patch v4.5 yet said   NOTHING about it in the Patch Notes? then they revert said changes   without further explaining anything. Epic games need to start informing   their community on changes that effect gameplay. It's cruel to change   things that have a huge difference on gameplay but not say anything   about it. Does Epic want me to go fucking crazy?

Please   make Fortnite like it was for the first 24 hours after Patch v4.5, -   the memory leak and everything will be happy days. Before u patched the   memory leak and fucked with the shotguns and movement/hit reg again.  But  I mean fuck, If I could have my own way I'd revert the game back  7-8  months when it was actually fun. Stop making it for try hard kids  with  no talent, it's morally wrong.

**Why can't Epic make up their minds?** Why do they constantly change important core gameplay mechanics which worked fine.

**""If it ain't broke, don't fix it!""**

**Fortnite** used to feel like a tripple A title and I had high expectations.

It now feels like a Rip-Off game from a **different reality :(**

I   do understand that most people didn't play it from release and might  not understand the points I am making. The fact is; the skill  ceiling  has dropped to a point it's almost criminal and the game is  generally  less clean and more clunky. To deny this, is simply  delusional...",FortNiteBR

* Epic buffed this gun way too much. This gun completely changed the end game meta in duos and squads. You get 1 or 2 squad members with a mini gun and your building is rendered obsolete. If mini guns are going to be continued to be this powerful then they need to increase the amount of rockets that can be held. You can easily be over 1k light ammo and just wreak havoc on builds with ease. There's no skill required in spraying at builds.

With each update it seems Epic keeps making this game more noob friendly, and it should be frustrating to anyone who has at least decent building ability.

I recently got downvoted for suggesting a idea I thought would be great for this game and I’ve never personally seen suggested on here.

My idea was that it’d be cool if there was kind of a “FortNite Hub” type of thing where you could load into, 

Buy new skins from item shop in there, in front of everyone (maybe could make people want to buy skins and emotes if they see other people buying them?)

Have 1v1s in certain designated areas with a leaderboard of who currently in the lobby is dominating in it, 

Trading area where players could 1 on 1 talk with each other and trade skins (limits gambling like CSGO, and limits scammers if there’s a notification saying anything else promised outside this trade, you are not promised and is a scam, and that you can’t trade someone something without something in return) and pro

And some LFG areas where players could walk into, and anyone in the room they can hear their mic and they can exchange info to eachother, add eachother, and get right into a squads game or duos right then and there. 

Also anyone who recently just won, or came in 2nd or 3rd place would have a crown above their head, gold being 1st, silver for 2nd, bronze for 3rd. And if they’re on a streak it’ll say a number next to it to.

I personally don’t see why this would be a bad idea. Think of like COD Headquarters but a lot bigger and more organized, or (bad example, but works) those big Minecraft servers like Mineplex or Hypixel.

I don’t see what the issue would be with it, I’d rather have the option to load into that and be interactive in a lobby with 100 other players all just chilling too, doing their own things, 1v1ing, doing parkour, or whatever. Of course you’d still have the option to just queue up for a game without it, you’d only load into it like you would a LTM.

Now someone tell me, why this would be a bad idea? I can understand this would take LOADS of work to implement into the game, but in the long run I think it’s better to have something interactive and always keeps you doing something than a boring lobby screen that just changes on the season and you browse through.

Why was I downvoted for having this idea without anyone giving me a reason to why they think it’s bad, do I have to say the same shit already suggested on here 1000x to get upvoted? Or can someone debate this to me why they think it’s a bad idea. Just want to know 

**TLDR**: I suggested a hub similar to CODs Headquarters or Minecraft servers hubs with interactive things to do that won’t make you bored as fast and people downvoted me and I don’t know why",FortNiteBR

I really enjoyed when thy got rid of the double pump and the pump was still strong but now shotguns are so unuseable unless you stack them and then cripple your load out with either less heals or ranged or no explosive.  Take me back to the Halloween patch, right after they fixed the rocket launcher pumpkin lag. I like the builder pro add, famas, slurp , chug, mini pots, lmg, launch pad, grav pad, one trap fits all, heavy shotty ( if shottys get fixed) impulse, stnk bombs, but really could do without everything else. Really hoping they nerf the smgs and make it so you can only hold one shotgun at a time, really think thats they only way to fix shotguns. Also bloom is really getting ridiculous. ""Get Gud"" just isnt the answer, i build fine (using builder pro) i can shred people with the smg, i can double pump or shotty combo with the best of them in the top 1&amp;#37; and at best was top .03&amp;#37; when i played only try hard win strats only no fucking around.

I’m all for that, as long as it doesn’t diminish the quality of the game for the players that have been playing for a while.

My first example of this is double pump. Double pump required skill to execute, and while it was done in the era in which people didn’t really build, it was the only true skill gap in my opinion. 

Merging double pump was all good with me because I wasn’t so good at it, but the consistent shotgun nerf season after season? Ridiculous. Hitting headshots, *MOST OF THE TIME* requires a considerable amount of skill, and one pumping someone add the only true reward for a great, skillful shotgun shot. 

Now that they decreased the headshot multiplier and the base damage, the consistency of shotguns have plummeted drastically. It is now MORE FEASIBLE to use an SMG or AR at close range, because at least you are rewarded when you hit your shots. 

Let me back up a little, when epic nerfed double pump, they did it by decreasing the rate in which you pull out a pump shotgun. That then ruined the building meta because after getting the high ground on someone, (which is one of the only skill gaps still remaining in this game) there is a considerable amount of time between exiting the build menu and pulling out and shooting your shotgun, allowing the bested enemy to regain position, even though you worked harder than them and deserve a chance to hit your shot.

All in all, it just seems like EPIC is trying to make this game a cluster of people with automatic rifles, running around and not building. And that to me completely ruins the integrity of fortnite, the most popular BR out there and the only reputable one in which you can build. 

I just hope they realize what they are doing, and the players that are actually good get rewarded for their practice and dedication to the game.  ",FortNiteBR

Some suggestions below like weapon skins, a new map, and a competitive mode could be the answer

This list does not include things mentioned in State of Development Posts or features that are already confirmed to be coming


This is a lengthy post so beware 

#1: bRiNg BaCk sKuLL tRoOpEr
lol I am kidding

Here it is:


**QUALITY OF LIFE**

•	Add in addition to kill counter, ‘team kills’ counter. Adds up all of your teams’ kills (obviously not in solo) for a counter next your solo kills. (three crosshairs instead of one to signify) Or shows next to squad mates name in tip left

•	Reset pre-edit and Reset rotation option (similar to reset building choice)

•	Show level banner around players in lobby

•	Shows # of kills in kill feed 
Example:
 boobguy45 (8 kills) eliminated yourmom69 (1 kill)


**WEAPON + ITEMS**

•	Slightly buff the burst assault rifles. They took a big hit with FSA update. Burst assault rifles really struggle at longer ranges. Give burst AR’s the sub treatment (no FSA and tweak accuracy/damage)

•	Trophy system legendary ‘yellow’ tier trap. Not infinite. Will destroy a certain amount of explosions in proximity

•	Guided missile return but does 0 damage. Allows rocket riding and to scope area like a UAV


•	Direct RPG hits do 999 dmg


•	Remove hit detection when using silenced weapons. They won’t know where damage is coming from. Would actually make the ‘silenced’ worth something


•	Buff the pump shotgun a bit. Either put the headshot multiplier back up or base damage. It took a huge hit (too big) with recent shotgun nerf.

•	Addition of shotguns (pump and tac) to chests. Crazy to me the most useful weapon in the game is not in chests

•	Slurp juice revamp: autofill tech. unused health should go towards shield. So if you have 91 HP, a slurp juice would give you 9 HP and 41 shield and if you were to have 51 hp slurp juice would get you 49 health and 1 shield. Either way you get a 50 boost but can be either shields or hp. Right now slurp wastes a lot of potential health as you need to be 75HP only for it to work best. This would make slurp juices useful and live up to their ‘epic’ rarity


•	Reduce drop-off damage/range for deagle and revolver


•	Rarity changes are due for certain items (no change in damage or drop rate):
Bush: No way this should be considered a ‘legendary.’ Keep same drop rate but have it has common or uncommon
Semi-Auto Sniper: There shouldn’t be a legendary semi-auto. I think blue/purple would suit this better.



**GAMEPLAY**

•	Make editing great again! Revert peek change and remove swap delay after building/editing

•	Add killcams!


•	Weapon swap delay should be removed and the double pump delay should be back in place.
The game was much smoother without weapon swap delay. 

•	Buff materials by around 25%. With recent llama and floor loot nerf as well as players building more and more every day, and materials buff is much needed and would be much appreciated  Nothing is worse than running out of materials after farming the whole game to run out pre-maturely!


**LTM’S**

•	OG map LTM

•	Blitz (Solo, Duo, Squads), 50v50, and the Playground should be permanent modes

•	Improvements to the Playground: keep loot option and able to join mid-game

•	Vaulted items LTM

**BUGS**

•	Everyone has the same ‘banner’ around rank. For example, I have the shining banner around me because I’m level 60+ and everyone I spectates has the same banner as well even though it’s not the case (friends level 30)

•	Fix players phasing through newly built structures freely. This can be addressed by pushing a player out to the side most of their body is on

**GENERAL**

•	Give founders their damn rewards already. Were promised months ago and nothing! Maybe being a founder could be like a monthly pass for loot? Would be a great way to boost STW sales. 

•	Wins count as star towards the battle pass


**MAP CHANGES**

•	Loot lake revamp. More islands/bridges 

•	New map with few POI’s. The game was much smoother back when there was no Tilted and few POI’s in my opinion



**COSMETICS**

•	Long-term rewards: level 100 skin(s), wins, kills, kills with each weapon (camos?)

•	Reward shop for wins. Still must be bought with v-bucks but must have a certain amount of wins to purchase. Similar to the season shop back in Season 1! 

•	Ability to buy a certain no-skin ‘skin’ for 200 v-bucks. This would grant some kind of reward to F2P players who get the 200 v-bucks from the free pass!


•	Add weapon skins! Either purchasable in the store or earned through kills with a certain weapon
Surprised they haven’t come yet. Free $ or good rewards for dedicated players.



**COMPETITIVE**

A competitive mode for Fortnite:

•	Matchmaking: Matchmakes cross-platform and SBMM. 

•	Rankings: There are rankings like Overwatch. Exclusive rewards like skins, a glider, etc.


•	Kills AND placement go towards ranking. Ranks reset with each season

•	New shooting system to reward skill in place only in competitive (no bloom)

•	‘Arena’ mode
A 1v1/2v2 ‘Arena’ mode could do wonders for a mode or even e-sports. Put players on a map the size of the startup island with a ever slowly closing storm, give  them max mats, let them choose their loadout: profit! Imagine the fights!

**STATS**

•	Add a leaderboard for squad and whole game for these post game stats. Who has the most damage in your squad/game? Right now post game stats are cool but no one really checks after the first few times they use. Would love to see how I stack up against my squad-mates and everyone else in the game

•	Add leaderboard at end of match that shows: winner, most kills. Would love to see how I stack up against everyone else in a match. Who had the most damage? Kills?


•	Completely rework leaderboards. Can’t even see how much wins your friends have! You should be able to see something like wins, wins this week, games played, average kills, downs/downed. Score and top 10 places for just the week is silly. Scrap the leaderboards how they are. Have them like call of duty. Can see top 100 of all time, this week, and month. Sorry but no one cares about score or top 3 places in a week. I will get more into stats later

•	The possibilities are endless with stats

Some Ideas I have:

Clutch wins (wins as last player in squad)

Solo Squad Wins

KD ratio

KDA ratio

Downs/downed ratio

Kills with each weapon

Wins on each landing spot

Wins with each skin

Most damage in a game

Most kills in a game

5+ kill games

10+ kill games

20+ kill games

30+ kill games

Number of times with Most kills in game/ MVP’s

10+ kill wins

20+ kill wins

30+ kill wins

avg kills per win

Wins per landing place

K/D / Wins with each skin

Most kills in lobby

Season 1,2,3,4 level, wins, and kills


All of this could be a part of a ‘combat record.’ Others can view yours and you can view theirs.






**End**

ok i'm gonna try to make this short and sweet because nobody reads my shit so i'm tired of putting in effort. Anyway when EPIC announced they might try this out everyone was up in flame, but after thinking about it for awhile I realized that nobody needs 3000 mats for a fight.

Honestly if all mats had a cap of 500, that would be perfect for fights. I rarely even use 500 in solosquads for a fight against one team. If you often need over 1500 mats in a single fight there are generally 2 reasons: you are either extremely inefficient with your mats or you and your opponent only know how to build and not how to aim or outplay.

Now capping mats at 500 with the current harvesting amount would be absolutely dreadful. Epic made farming mats take way too long to deter people from only building. However, having a slow farm and high cap only slows people down from reaching the cap. The reverse would be far superior for what epic is trying to achieve, and will greatly speed up the game. I would much rather be able to start my fights, build my shit, and get back to max mats after a minute of farming and have 9 to actually play the game instead of farming for 10 minutes after I win the fight.

**TL;DR** cap mats at 500 each, but increase the amount of mats gained heavily

My idea is that level 55 should be when all the lights on Omega are unlocked, like the extras that run down his torso and whatnot. Then at level 80, the option should be to change the light color. This would make me feel as though I got the most out of the money I spent on the battle pass while still letting people who grinded to level 80 show off hard they worked.

I have numerous sources which are giving me this information, but I am sure this is 99&amp;#37; correct. However EVERYTHING I say here is subject to change.

The recent 'leak' about Jurassic Jungle, animals in Fortnite, etc is sort of FAKE. There will be no animals coming to Fortnite.  However, the Pirates' Place rumour is TRUE, but it will be Snobby Shores that will be renamed, NOT Moisty.

Talking about Moisty, the huge 'leviathan' which is meant to destroy Moisty is TRUE, but there are somethings that have been changed. The Leviathan was just a 'placeholder'. It won't actually be a Leviathan, instead it will be a T-REX. The Final Fight mode was originally intended to be the 50v50 but with leviathan vs carbide omega. This changed and the upcoming Final Fight V2 will be the trex vs carbide omega. (there is no confirmation that it will be carbide and omega, nonetheless all the 'rumours' I've heard have implied it is). This mode will be Final Fight with a twist. 50V50 but one team has to escort the T-REX to Moisty from Greasy and the other has to defend the TREX. There is NO storm, unlimited respawns and NO reviving. The TREX will destroy anything in its path, so building in front of it will not work. Someone has to be next to the TREX to escort it and if it takes too much damage it will start to stop for 1 minute. It does have health however I doubt it can be killed. After a certain number of minutes (most likely 20) the final fight countdown timer will begin. If the team escorting still hasn't completed the task, the other team win. If the TREX does manage to get to Moisty, another 'rift' will open. This rift will open a gateway for the Visitor to get through. The Visitor will then create another rift which takes the TREX with it. Both rifts will start to crack and trees, the film set, etc will slowly be destroyed (each day). 

Why is the visitor doing this?

The Visitor is just trying to escape. He created all the 'rifts' trying to escape the Fortnite World. When the massive crack appeared in the sky, that was him stuck in the Space Time Continuum, hence why it is expanding and portals are appearing, he is trying to escape. He eventually succeeds but then realises the damage he has done. (why he takes out the TREX).  

Near the end of S4, we will see a completely obliterated Moisty, Lonely Lodge's lodge missing, and the massive crack start to close. Tomato Town and Greasy Grove will survive, however the Tomatohead and Durrburger will have appeared out of one of the portals and crash back down into both buildings. 

In S5, we learn that Retail will survive, but have a reskin due to the portal. The portal replaced the modern retail with a Roman Empire version of Retail. In the place of the shop and car park will be a roman Colosseum. Tilted will have a brand new building under construction as well as another new building in the place of the old one which was under construction. The Tier 100 skin will be Davy Jones. The football pitch will be replaced by a Pyramid and the area around it will be desert. The Motel will become Wild West themed. This area of desert stops past Junk Junction and is called  Junk Junction will be replaced by a spin off of Area 51, (which has yet to be named). This means S5 WILL be history themed! Dusty Divot will start to repair (naturally) and the two Warehouses will be destroyed and rebuilt in the place of the facility, along with the third one. The Factories next to retail will also be rebuilt in this new area along with new factories, warehouses etc. It will start to become a new city! The dirt transformed into hills, with a city in the center. The area will be renamed 'Dusty Dawning'. 

 Don't shoot the messenger, Epic!

THIS WAS WROTE 5/7/18 AND SO FAR EVERYTHING SEEMS CORRECT.",FortNiteBR

The skins and cosmetics were fine to leak but considering at the beginning of the season, we had an Epic Employee leak out information about the comet and the Season 4 entirely, it ruined the season for us. The blockbuster skin was a let down but the hype for it was real because it wasn’t leaked or confirmed. Now we have another leaker leaking info on Season 5, and it’s just eliminating the hype and suspense for the seasons to come. The problem is also that all these social media pages post non-stop on the leaks so there’s no escape from seeing it. It’s no fun. ",FortNiteBR

Now I know alot of people like to defend epic and stuff and say that they are all separate things but omega doesn't have a glider or back bling, teknique doesn't have a pickaxe and more that don't come to mind. I understand that we are not entitled to extra stuff but epic are making serious money and I see no reason for them to use any predatory business practices. This is a tame one but it's still purposely done to draw out the completionist/ocd side of people to need to use the full set or for men/women to want to use their appropriate gender and need to pay for it. 

I couldn't care less about the exclusive factor of BP skins btw, this is purely from a consumer friendly standpoint. If my girlfriend wants to use oblivion she shouldn't have to pay 20 bucks. If I want to have a matching glider for my omega it shouldn't cost me 1200 vbucks.

I know you guys want some skins that were in the game before and you do not have the chance to obtain it again and you want it, I GET IT.

But understand this, not everyone is suppose to have everything. Keeping some items rare in games is always good, there is games where things are sold once and are not obtainable ever again and they keep them special.

I regret not buying Ghoul, I regret not buying GingerBread, I regret not buying Nog Ops. Still I do not spam reddit with this posts begging for them to re release them.

Red Knight is a joke now, I use to know that every time I fought one it would be an intense fight. Now every lobby is filled with red knights and most of the ones I have fought are below average players and Red Knights are not scary or intimidating anymore.

Mods keep removing people posting fun memes post even some that I have never seen being reused, yet they allow every single day those posts to make it to the front page.

My favorite skins in the game is Renegade Raider and Ghoul. I do not own either, I do not want them being released again just for them to become the next default.

If you're a kid who keeps posting this over and over again, its whatever kids will be kids. But if you're a grown man keep making this type of posts ""PLeaZE no SkIN EliTiSm"", wow, shame on you crying over a video game skin.

Haunted hills will stay the same since it's already oldern themed except for a few small things added

Lonely lodge will become a WWII military base, 

Retail row will become futuristic themed.

The huge soccer field near junk junction will become a collisuem, (sorry if I spelt that wrong) and junk junction itself will become ancient roman themed

Wailing woods will become a prehistoric jungle, being cave man themed with stuff like stone houses and appliances. It's a lot like the flinstones. 

The huge mountain behind greasy grove will become a volcano, it will erupt at the end of season 5.

Lucky Landing will mostly stay similar to what it is now with a few changes to make it look more like feudal japan.

Salty springs will be connected to the desert and will be themed around ancient egypt. There will be stuff like pyramids and tombs.

Moisty mire will become a pirate cove full of pirate ships.

The tunnels in shifty shafts will collapse into one big cave

Risky reels will be connected to the wailing woods jungle and will be aztec themed.

The strip mall found in the data will be unused until season 6

Dusty divot will become alien themed

Most smaller spots on the map like the chair town or crates will be gone completely or merged with a major spot

Pleasent park will become ancient greek themed.

Tomato town will turn into a sorta laboratory where a bunch of scientists are trying to bring the map back to normal

The racetrack will become an actual big futuristic like racetrack with tons of cool cars around it. It's kinda like F-Zero

The island at the middle of loot lake will get bigger and a huge castle will be there, the rest of the lake becoming a moat. The nearby factory will be gone completely 

Greasy grove will become 80's themed with older technology and featuring trends from around that time

The prison will becomea huge ancient temple

The motel will be a small town themed around peasant life in medieval times


Battle pass:

Many of the dances will be themed around oldern dances because of the history theme

The tier 1 skin will be a caveman and the tier 100 one will be the flying dutchman

Other skins include samurai, surfers, roman soilders, military troops, cowboys, and much more

A lot needs to be changed. 

This is not a rant but more of a ""reminder"" to what EPIC has not fixed/adjusted.

Phasing through floors/walls is game breaking, it does not happen to me a lot and truthfully I can maybe count the total amount of times on one hand but it shouldn't be in the game and it's been here for far too long.

Shotguns: These beasts need to be adjusted. No, not buffed and no, not nerfed but.. adjusted. The pellets need have a smaller RNG then they do now or a set RNG with every shot. Hitting someone from room to room with one shot is rewarding but hitting someone pointblank in the head for 9 is pathetic. 

Hop rocks: They need to get the fuck out the game already, again nothing I have been impacted with but I have noticed teams will stay longer in the storm or on the border due to them just being able to pick up rocks at dusty and hit circle in no time. They're fun, but they've had their time.

Bounce pads: Love them, please forever keep them.

Traps: Need to be nerfed, when a trap does more damage to you than a point blank RPG... Something is wrong. 

Snipers: These things need a buff -- We all got used to the draw back time when switching to them but you're taking away the skill gap from the people who have really practiced and mastered the skill.

Console Aim Assist: Aim assist should never drag your ADS to an enemy who has already been eliminated.

Building: Turbo building needs a fix, it's still not perfect.

Console/PC Editing: Being able to edit and switch back to a gun needs to be re-implemented. It's what differentiates skilled players from none skilled players. Keep the gun swap duration, just shorten the edit to gun switch duration.

Shopping carts: People are still launching across the map. 

Clingers: Nerf them or remove them, having the max stacked is OP af.

Yes Epic gave us double xp last weekend but only on match score and nothing else. Well over 2 months and 1 double xp weekend is dismal for a game this size in comparison to other developers and their communities.

Having changed the xp progression with progress being a lot slower this season, the whole system is geared to buying the battle pass, upgrading it from the start in order to earn more xp. For example if you buy all 100 tiers you’ll get 1000xp from your daily challenges instead of 500. I for one have played the recommend hours and still haven’t reached 80. I’ve played as much as possible and I get the argument saying it’s only for the elite but I shouldn’t have to play a unreal amount of hours in order to get the lights.

If I had spent my money on buying all the tiers I more than likely would be 80. That’s not fair. 

I would’ve liked Epic to have double or even triple xp for this last weekend but I knew that wasn’t going to happen. 

I’ve been looking on twitter regarding double xp for about 3 weeks now. There’s hundreds of tweets everyday asking for xp, I myself have asked multiple times. To say that one double xp weekend is enough is not true. I personally would like the threshold lowered to 70 for the lights but that won’t happen. 

So for all my friends that hasn’t reached level 80 and has tried speaking to Epic in some format, just remember they haven’t listened and if you want to complete the battle pass buy it.

So I get on my PC and go to my epic games launcher, which was running and logged in all night, and yep my account is gone, my previous password is no longer the password, but I do still have my email linked to the account. It sounds simple to me at this point, just use my email thats linked to the account to change my password, but when I click forgot password, the email from epic to reset my password comes in Russian, and has my name listed wrong. Here’s where I need advice, is the change password email still safe to use even though it is in Russian, I’m assuming the hacker is located in Russia, or should I not trust the email and just contact epic support.

The durr burger was found irl in the desert and there was a nuber you could call and it made the weird sound of the cracks. i belive that the durr burger was dragged through some kind of portal (time) and was spit out in the desert that will take over moisty. also, if the burger was taken through time, the season theme might be history, as many have already thought.

Now, I can already hear you saying, ""Well duh, its a fictional video game where people skydive out of a bus supported by a balloon."" And yes, you're right. But there's more.

How is health not a serious issue in the Fortnite Universe? You're telling me that our troops Havoc and Raptor (just to name a few) get their gains off of greasy hamburgers and tomato pizzas? You think I believe that absolute units like the soccer players and basketball all-stars stay in athletic condition from eating at taco stands and food trucks? That can't be good for you, and definitely can't make you strong enough to be able to carry a Rocket Launcher, an automatic rifle, AND a sniper while still having the strength to hold potions and first aid kits (trust me, Im on that food plan now and things arent looking too bright).

So, here's my proposal: Veggie-ops. The crouton crusader of Fatal Fields. A man in a costume similar in concept to the beloved Tomatohead. A vegan-safe mascot encouraging the youth to eat properly so that they can grow up to be big and strong like their favorite Fortnite heros.

My idea for the skin goes as follows, but feel free to reimagine him in any way possible.

The head could be a head of lettuce similar to the ones growing in Fatal. Olives for eyes would be kinda funny. He could a sport casual bbq-dad apron that reads anything you want it to read. His legs could be cornstalks because thats funny to me for some reason. As for a harvesting tool, I think that a salad fork with a giant pea pod on the end would fit well. I also like the idea of a breadstick pickaxe. The glider could be made up of various vegetables, too- peas, lettuce, olives, cabbage, corn, broccoli, cucumbers, really anything. As for the back bling, I think a frozen bag of peas would be kinda funny. Maybe even a bag or something containing ranch, salad dressing, garlic sauce, a pepper shaker, maybe even all four.

Thank you for taking the time to read my garbage-fire of a text post. Before voting/commenting please keep in mind that I wrote this at 4 am and I'm fully aware of how rediculously stupid this idea is. Thought I'd share anyway.

So that’s what happened: yesterday I logged into my account and found out that my V-Bucks were spent in the battle pass. I didn’t do it, and I don't even care if it was someone who logged into my account or a kind of error in the system, I just wanted my V-Bucks back, since the new season is going to start in 3 days. So that's what I did: I wrote a message to the Italian support and I got what clearly was an automatic reply. I tried to answer it, since it didn't say it was a no reply system, but I just got a blank reply for every email I wrote. So I tried to create another support request giving more details from the start, but I just received the same message as before, and then the same blank replies when I tried to write back. So I thought: ""Well, maybe the Italian support is just an automatic system since they didn't even translate the FAQs yet. Let's try to write to the English support."". Still nothing, just the same automatic reply (this time in English though) and then the same blank messages. I was going to give up, but this morning I wanted to try a thing: send to them a message choosing the same issue but with an empty message, so I just wrote ""test"" in both the object and the message box. Guess what they replied? If your guess is ""the same fucking automatic reply"", then you're correct. They don't care at all if you have a problem with their game, you already spent money on it, so it's all right.

TL;DR: The title says it all. You can write literally anything in your help request, and using the same settings (platform, game issue, etc...) you will always get the same automatic reply.

The reason I quit back than was that the game became boring, it wasn’t about the game itself , it was because everything took to much time, you keeper walking around seeing no one, this stressed me so much that I couldn’t handle it anymore.

Now I came back yesterday and played 50vs50, it was so much fun that I actually started caring about the game again.

So there will be a moment where you will get bored too, so I think we should add a second main game mode where we have respawns, smaller maps, start weapons ( everyone can choose he’s layout with green and blue items ).


Fortnite doesn’t have to stay as a BR, it can become much more.



ALSO , give us ways to feel unique in game man, it’s so annoying that there are no real limited skins and everyone can look like everyone.

We nerfed shotguns with the intent of making the meta less stale, and now we're back to square one.","The game was balanced after the shotgun nerf. SMGs and C4's got buffed around that time too, and everything was fine for a while. But then EPIC releases 2 bullshit patches in a row. 

The first one buffs SMGs to the point of being ridiculously OP, and the second one buffs all explosives to the same level of OPness as well as adding a new overly powerful SMG. 


Why is it that: 

* You're able to destroy the biggest building in the game with a single stack of C4's? 
* You can be melted from full health full shield in a second by a tactical SMG? 
* A blue silenced SMG is the best AR in the game?

* The best build battle strategy is to either shoot your opponent's ramps out with an SMG or get down to the bottom and C4 it out?

Every SMG and explosive absolutely melts buildings and players now. What happened to ""This isn't PUBG, building is the most important part of the game and should be encouraged as much as possible""? This anti-skill meta is starting to make me miss the shotgun meta. Back then I used to complain about how OP shotguns were and how building was causing an inifinite CQC meta. Now I realise that I was just bad and wanted an excuse for shotguns and building to be nerfed because I couldn't aim or build. But I think EPIC has taken SMGs a bit too far with this one, and they're really going too far with trying to get rid of building as a strategy. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

Unfortunnaly there was a lot of missinformation, so I'm here trying to share what I figured out.

Well, first of all, I tried this last season and it actually worked, but not how I expected. On the last week of the season, for some reason, my dailys just dissapeard and I didn't knew why, luckily there was enough time to another attempt, and now that I've done some testing, I can finally explain how it works.

You can only have 3 uncompleted dailys at once.
You can have as much completed dailys as you want, but if you have at least one, you cant replace any dailys until you collect they all.
If you have more than one completed daily, the game will auto colect the rewards the next time you receive a daily until there's only one completed daily remaning.
A completed daily doesn't count for the max total of 3 uncompleted dailys that you have.

This means that is possible to carry over 4 dailys from season 4 to 5, and with the one that you'll get in the first day of the season, you'll start with a total of 5.

To do this, just keep 3 dailys before 07/11, 1 completed and 2 uncompleted, then on 07/11 you need to complete at least one more daily before 07/12. This way you'll have less than 3 uncompleted one's and will be able to receive the daily from 07/12. Also, DON'T login or stay logged on 07/12 before the patch release or you'll receive the 07/12 daily and the system will auto collect your dailys until there's only one left :/",FortNiteBR

2)PLEASE ADD HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THE BATTLE BUS WHEN YOU ARE IN IT.

3)Explosive slots... I would be fine with reducing the number of each explosive (from 10 to 5) if the option is given for explosive/boogie bomb/port a fort/ stink bomb, slots.

4) PLEASE work around a cross progression. I spend too much money on the game to have it be only on one console. And it’s aggravating on season 4 because I used to be able to Max both battle passes and now with me trying to get level 80 for max omega it’s IMPOSSIBLE to do that now.

5)A “slipper” option. Where you can disable your footsteps sounds of yourself in game. I’ve played so much I know when I’m making a lot of noise while walking. Sometimes it confuses me to where I have to stand still to hear someone coming. 

6)Purchasing tier levels in store (especially for maxed battle pass owners that can’t vehicular from the 900 vbuck 10 tiers in stone) could give XP while trying to get higher levels. 

7) Numbers displayed when hitting someone with a bullet displays the life they have left, not what you took off.

8)vault the Scoped AR

Sadly however, since the introduction of this thirsting has become a lot more common and a lot more frustrating.

Example: you're in a fight with a duo, one of them knocks you down. Whilst your team mate is there shooting them, they still go out of their way to thirst you just for that quick little boost in health. Your team mate then kills them as they were so focused on you for health that he got the jump on them. In the end that leaves that duo dead and your team mate without a partner just because the other team wanted a slight bit of health. It's happened to me so is a very legitimate scenario

My fix, remove it from duos and squads. In solos it is great. Gives you a boost. Makes you play more aggressive and rewards that. But it duos and squads all it does is encourage people to thirst no matter the situation and I think that's wrong

Just my opinion, if you agree or disagree, let me know.",FortNiteBR

And it gets kinda tiring dropping every game knowing you gotta find a pump fast and hopefully a follow up smg or ar, but if your good you dont even need that you can just pump, build and pump again. If you get into a fight you know you will have to hit your pump shots to get solid damage and at the same time make sure your opponent doesnt hit his pump shots on you. So you both build to try to get your pump shots off through maneuvering and edits and whoever hits those 1 or 2 shots basically wins the fight. The tac cannot compete in that type of fight is what im saying. But the double barrel can. They could buff the tac to have a minumum damage of 40 or 50 no matter how many pellets hit and up the overall damage a little. Grey tac 72 damage green tac 76 damage blue tac 80 damage ",FortNiteBR

Compared to its original debut, the sword is a greater risk vs reward weapon. By deciding to wield it, you are forfeiting all guns and building permission and rely solely on the natural cover and previously built structures which can be problematic for the wielder as any jump they make cleaves any structures in their way, making them potentially vulnerable. Additionally, the leap incapacitates the user for several seconds if they don't damage another player, this makes them easier to shoot when retreating and easier to punish if they failed a leap. Lastly, the range of the sword was ""fixed"". While it was possible before to hit targets well outside the blade's reach, you can no longer do that and you are still pinned to the ground when swinging it.  


To put it in a list:

* You forfeit building permissions
* You forfeit the right to farm materials
* You can only utilize natural cover
* The blue glow you emit and the loud ominous noises make it hard to hide
* Leaping will stun you for a long period if you don't deal damage to a player
* Fixed sword reach means less ridiculous hitboxes

&amp;#x200B;

And more, however, the sword still hits for 75 damage on swipes, 25 damage on leaps, and can passively heal the wielder out of combat. The sword is still a very strong weapon but not as strong as it once was. I believe it could easily be brought into main modes and if not, a permanent ""Mythic"" LTM, similar to playground and creative where it and other mythic items are always available.",FortNiteBR

its been 35 minutes already and the update is 84% complete.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I decided I wanted to grind to get to level 100 in season 9 or 10 (during summer break). I found out it takes 1,213,750 XP to get level 100. You get a total of 65k XP from 4 BP challenges alone, and an additional 50k XP from competing weekly challenges if you buy the entire pass day one. Subtract that from the grand total and it takes you down to 1,098,750. You also get XP for leveling up (200 at every level) (500 every 5th level) (1k every 10th level). That brings the total down to 1,067,750. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for gameplay. In solo matches, assume you get at least top 3 with anywhere from 1-5 kills, you would get somewhere between 900-1200 XP. Doing that would require 970 games (I did about an average of 1.1k XP/game). The average game is about 18 minutes. That brings you to 17,460 minutes, or 291 hours. If you play 6 hours a day and follow the steps needed to get the XP you should be getting, you could have level 100 in 49 days.

&amp;#x200B;

But say you have a full squad of people with a high tier battle pass. If you survive for a long time, you can get around 2k XP per game. If you place high in every squad game, it would take around 534 games, which would take a total of 160 hours. Say you only play 4 hours with a full squad, it would take you 40 days, or if you wanted to play 6 hours, it would take 27 days. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, if you want to reach level 100 easily, PLAY CONSERVATIVE SQUADS WITH HIGH TIER FRIENDS.",FortNiteBR

Features could be

Name: Creaky Caverns

Loot: med chest spawns

Maybe a large center cave that has a drop to a lower part with water in it where you could find ruins of a old civilization where most the chest spawns would be

Tunnels like the one at the umbrella mine by lazy links that would all lead back up to the center area or to more tunnels

Plenty of secret chest spawns behind walls and such

Built in traps in the ruins nothing big but a 5-10 damage arrow trap maybe

100% chance of finding a gold weapon in the temples/ruins loot room but picking it up without putting something in its place could make something happen.

The trap ideas may not be possible but I would love to see a underground cave with ruins as a POI in a (hopefully recent) update.",FortNiteBR

The heavy would only be able to break through 1 layer of wood.

Perhaps make a building update in which a player cannot place a building piece in the same place for 0.5-2 seconds.

This could change the meta to a big scale, forcing players to be on the constant move when fighting.


Another possibility to make this a little less terrifying is maybe that this is for a specific material

Examples:
Jonesy has a squad pinning him down but he is holding a wall down making it impossible for the squad to hit him, however with the suggestion implemented he wouldn’t be able to place the wall for another half second meaning he is guaranteed to either receive damage or the squad members could enter the room before he places the wall.

Or

A player is being pinned down by a player, his wooden wall breaks meaning he cannot place another wooden wall for another half second, however he can change to brick meaning he can instantly put another wall Down however this is heavily going to drain his materials unless he moves away.


Many will disagree with this, however I feel it would make strategy’s more creative instead of a simple hold of a button.",FortNiteBR

On Fortnite Tracker, it doesn’t show time played

Wof.gg doesn’t work for me, for whatever reason whenever I type in a name (any name) the website fails to connect

I found the ini file which should have my total time, but the numbers are way off, the total time is not what it should be even remotely, and the # of matches played is 1/4 of that of Fortnite Tracker

I’ve looked on dozens of forum pages, various types of trackers, and some very sketch websites. When I first started this, I just wanted to know, but now it’s a quest.

Stats have shown time and time again that controller players are at a major disadvantage. You have your outliers (the pros) of course, but besides the few we all know how much of a disadvantage you face when you’re controller against kb+m. There’s no argument for it. So to play in a Cup there is no joy in the last few circles, there is no joy gaining points, there’s no joy to play. 

I think this game has hit a wall when it comes to its pubs and non-competitive players. There’s no chance for new players and less skilled players to win a game, even a pub. I personally don’t play it competitively because of the few times I’ve tried the cups. I think moving to a ranked / MMR playlist is needed going forward because I play two pubs and then I’m on to another game. The ranked playlist along with the Pop Up Cups will need to be PC or console or I might be staying off the game. 

I understand I’m one person with my own opinion but I just hate to see this game die(for me). This game is great because there’s always room to improve, always skills to learn, always a chance to get better. It’s satisfying to outplay, out-build, or out-smart someone. On the reverse side when I’m outplayed, out-built, or out-smarted there’s a “tip of the cap” feeling for me. It’s a little drive to improve instead of just rage like most gamers might feel. 

I don’t think the game will die out from other games, I am just worried we may be missing an opportunity. 

TLDR: Console vs. PC is and always will be an unfair fight. I don’t care how good you are

&amp;#x200B;

It all starts with rifts, rifts are the portals scattered around the battlefield that teleport you into the sky for good mobility. Rifts came into play for season 5 all because the visitors rocket caused a shift in space time. Well I have looked into rifts and the butterfly event as my main cause to all of this happening. Now I don't know where to start so there may be some back and forth but I will label all my main points to not overwhelm you.  


***The In Between***

The world wide creative director for epic games *Donald Mustard* after the butterfly event changed his location to the in between, stating that the white tube world we saw in the butterfly event is called the In Between. This is one of the driving forces to this perspective of what is going on in the story line, because I think the In between is the part that is ""*in between*"" when you first go into a rift and come out, and the tubes are the wormholes.  


***Rifts***

When you first touch a rift, white sparks fly out and a beacon of light appears. well its obvious that the white sparks are the same color as the in between, but the beacon of light shown for a few frames should be obvious that its a worm hole that shoots you to the sky, and where are worm holes in the in between, that's right the tubes. We also can state the obvious that once you left the in between, we also came out of a rift, but there are still a lot of things relating to rifts that need their own section because its too big.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Cube***

The cube spawned in late season 5 and rolled around the map, meeting its final destination at loot lake. the cube was made because of the crack in the sky from the rocket event in season 4. The crack was made because of the rocket teleporting across the map with rifts, in which it ended leaving a giant crack in the sky (in which it was a giant rift basically). The crack started to shrink until it came to its most condensed size of it left, with the law of conservation of energy stating, energy cannot be created nor destroyed, so the rest of the crack shot its power into a 3 dimensional cube. So this means that all this time, the cube was just a 3 dimensional giant rift. My guesses is that the giant crack was supposed to represent the rift to the in betweens hub (where we got teleported in the cube event), and then got transfered to the cube. The cube did its thing, which was basically useless until the cube event in which it exploded devouring the battlefield in the light which basically was a rift.  


***The Butterfly***

The butterfly in the cube event was a big reason but pretty obvious so I'm going to keep this point short and sweet. The butterfly from the butterfly event was obviously representing a rift as it was made up of the same glass shards as a rift would have, but I think it was also something else. Going back to when the cube was first formed, do you remember when the cube was made and it shot ""all"" of its energy into the cube, well after the cube was fully formed, the crack lingered for a little bit in the air before *Sparks* came out of where it vanished to. Well as stated earlier and the fact that energy cannot be made nor destroyed, well where did that last bit of energy go, well into the in between as the butterfly. Now this may be the  biggest stretch of my whole theory but hear me out, when sparks came out, it rifted itself to the inside out because sparks come out when you enter a rift. And it would also make sense that sense we exited out of the in between after we touched the butterfly, making a correlation between the cube and how we entered, and the butterfly along with how we exited.

&amp;#x200B;

***The Unlikely but Possible***

Now this one doesn't have that much evidence behind it besides the fact of time, and that I think after the cube event, we got sense a little into the future. Now my little evidence to prove so is that the islands are pieces from the floating cube island. They had no grass on them and that it takes time for any sort of plants to grow on them. We also have the fact that suddenly rapids going down into loot lake where turned into calm rivers, well the only way for that to happen would be erosion and that takes time. We also have the final point is that rifts where shown as the main point of season 5, bringing stuff from the past to present, which it may have done to everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure there is also more to this theory that I just haven't picked up on, but I know this is highly likely to have been the whole reason to the fortnite storyline. also shameless plug to everyone, go sub to drem on youtube. Anyways I hope that you all can find more points and that this gets spread widely among the community as this is highly possible of being true

It’s so fucking unnecessary when you only have 1 pump in your inventory and is so frustrating when you’re pump-building pump-editing and get punished again for being too fast or good.

So it’s like you pump them, edit the floor open to pump again but nah now your dumbass is standing their exposed and can’t nail the shot on them and then they just hit you for like 150 as you’re standing there trying to shoot them.

Its just so clunky and a lame way to “fix” double pumping, if double pump isnt going to be a thing just make it so it only happens when 2 pumps or shotguns are in your inventory.

Overall, I still never got why DP was patched after s4 when they spent so long trying to balance double pump and finally almost did it.

S2 DP was beyond OP, but if you got shitted on in S4 by someone double pumping, just face it you probably were shitted on and that person would’ve killed you the same if they had only 1 pump.

So I have been thinking about this for about three or four weeks, if you look at the loading screens for week sever or week eight of this battle pass and read the descriptions they say “Why am I awake? The ice was never supposed to thaw.” And “I have to restore order.” If you think about it it’s the ice king talking to himself, he was keeping the castle frozen for a reason... the reason is “the prisoner” so my theory is that the ice king is a good guy, the prisoner is the bad guy. So if I am correct I think that “the prisoner” was trying to destroy the ice kings kingdom so the ice king decided to sacrifice himself for the good of his kingdom and separated the iceberg from the island that his castle is from drained the prisoner of his magma, locked him up in the dungeon, froze him, and then set the iceberg into a super deep freeze, and was hoping that they would stay frozen forever, but when the iceberg came crashing into the side of the Battle Royale island the ice started to begin to melt, so when the ice king woke up from his eternal ice sleep he was afraid the prisoner would escape and regain power and do the bad thing he was trying to do to his home and destroy everything. So he sent out a ice blast hoping that if the prisoner had escaped the ice legion fiends would kill him as he would not be able to regain power if he was in a snow storm.

As I said this is just a theory. I think I am the first person to post this theory anywhere, I am not sure though, if you have any ideas about rather or not this could be true, anyways tell me what you think in the comments, stay cooler than the ice king. Piece out.

Kills? Player A and Player B could have 650 kills each, but it could have taken player A 4x as long, therefor it’s likely Player B is a better player, yet they would be in the same lobby &amp; it wouldn’t work.

Wins? Player X and Player Y could both have 100 wins but Player X could have 20 bombs while Player Y camps for his wins, meaning they’d be in the same lobby but Player X is most likely the better player.  

Time played? Player 1 and Player 2 could both have spent 500 hours in the game, but player 1 could have 10 wins while Player 2 has 100 wins. 

None of these solutions would make the lobbies “fair”. The only reasonable solution would be to introduce a combination of these methods, but that would be *extremely* specific, and could result in consistent 60-70 player lobbies for each level of skin. I understand why Epic hasn’t introduced it as it would be very difficult and likely people would still complain. If you have any solutions you feel would work feel free to suggest it below.

I usually land in a high pop spot and rack up 6-10 kills only to die to someone late game who hasn‚Äôt killed anyone. I understand that many of these players are kids who need to drop in low pop areas but what if we had a streak system. 

5 kills - 2 mini potions as a reward
10 kills - 2 large potions
15 kills - chug jug

I don‚Äôt think weapons should be rewarded but some form of health instead as usually I have taken a beating from being in multiple gun fights while the guy I face usually has just sat in a bush. If someone has already suggested this I‚Äôm sorry I may not have seen it. 
Any constructive criticism would be greatly appreciated. I‚Äôm sure there are flaws to what I‚Äôve said.

Yes, I'm bad at the game and I know that there are already 1000 posts about this, but I will propose some tweaks.


A weapon that shows you everything on the map (especially on the last circles) from the above (just for this it would be a granted slot for me) and does more then 100 dmg while you are campered is BROKEN. You can kill 2 men that are fighting each other easily. 
I already tried it, and it's fucking OP. What's the counterplay? Close yourself in a cage? Then it's OP if it force you to do that every 5 seconds. Shoot it and risk to blow up if you miss? OP. Rush the guy? Yes, if you find him before he blows you up, and even if you reach him he'll just switch to pump.
Too much reward for the little risk it takes.


In solo it might be balanced, but in squad/duo your teammate can call close enemies and you just press and go back to kill them, then camper again :\ This weapon just promote camping!


I propose some of this nerfs: 

-less travel speed or less duration

-less damage

-less HP, so it can be shot more safely

-you have to wait for it to explode before going back to your character, so it can be countered by pushing.

-harder to control.

-limit the rocket you can bring, at least for this weapon.



Even with this, the map control this shit gives is insane, but at least it would have healty counterplays.",FortNiteBR

Think about all of the locations that go mostly unused due to being very far outside of the zone 90% of the time.

They would be used a lot more often if people always knew where the first zone would be, so the times that they are near the zone people will drop there.

This will cause the zone to be crowded like Blitz, but this allows them to add as many locations as they want.

Also, the first zone could be split into two zones. With the first one being slightly bigger than the normal first one, and the second one being slightly smaller. The time to the third circle would be the same as the time to the 2nd circle now... if that makes sense. That‚Äôd also help with the crowdedness.

My argument lies within the straight facts of how Pinocchio wanted to become a real boy. Pinocchio wished and wished to become a real boy and then a light shined upon him and guess what?????? HE BECAME A REAL BOY. 

In being a Fortnite specialist and observer of these three structures, I have developed the skill to hear their thoughts when I go to them. I take notes on what they tell me. The llama told me, ‚ÄúI have wanted to be a real llama for soooo long but I have never had the opportunity to become real.‚Äù Then he went on to explain the most magnificent thing ever, ‚ÄúOn the day when the meteor strikes our map, me, mrs. crabbie, and Mr. fox will come to life. We are already alive inside but we need the strength of the meteor to finish the job.‚Äù

He then went on to quote the experience that Daenerys had with her own dragons. He said, ‚ÄúJust like Daenerys‚Äô dragons, we will come to life with the help of the meteor.‚Äù 

Then, I went on to speak with Mr. fox. He told me that the meteor is a sign of them coming to life and that all of us pvp players shall be scared. In hearing this, I wet my pants a little.  He told me that after we defeat everyone else on the map that we have to then defeat all three live creatures. Of course, he told me that because I am their friend and specialist upon their existence, that when I defeat everyone, they will come and bow down to me. He then said that they will only bow down to those who get 40+ kill games, their owners, or their friends (me and me only). 

They told me to tell everyone and that they should prepare for this apocalypse that is upon us. ",FortNiteBR

I hate that there is a HUGE component of luck on the initial drop.  I'm all for randomization, but this is just way out of hand.  8/10 games I play I see people running for a shotgun and then just gunning down anyone around who doesn't have a weapon.

EPIC, catering to rocket riding and allowing a glitch to stay in the game is beyond ridiculous. Please, balance the game and make it more like ""Fortnite"". Or name the game ""Rocket Riders"".  Be so much fun building a fort and not having to worry about missiles dropping on top of my head. Better yet, rockets with people on top of them dropping on my head. Why have a jump pad in the game?  Be fun to build forts and fight each other from fort to fort. That aspect of the game is gone. IMO the game would be SO much better without RPG'S and Guided Missiles. Grenade Launcher with it's limited distance would be perfect! Nope, EPIC dug itself a deep hole that they will never get out of. Now, if they decide to take out rocket riding. They will lose players. Should have took it out of the game when it was first discovered! I won't be playing Fortnite anymore. Simply, because it's unbalanced and catered to streamers begging for more explosives and shotguns. Sucks, because I loved playing Fortnite.

138,hots_nexus,1522432020,88c8r9,38,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88c8r9/bloom_is_the_best_decision_epic_games_made_and/,4,Bloom is the best decision Epic Games made and here is why.,"The discussion about the bloom is currently one-sided, with a very vocal minority bashing bloom for all of the perceived problems of the game. I strongly disagree with that opinion and I believe bloom is a very good thing and one of the reasons the current Fortnite gameplay is so fun and popular.

1. The first argument for bloom is that Epic Games wants to promote short / medium shooting and not long range shooting. That's why the sniper, crossbow and hunting rifle have projectiles. They WANT for these weapons to be hard to shoot with to force players to move closer to each other. If your first shot is accurate, the range doesn't matter. While it is technically harder to palce your cursor the further your enemy is, in practice it doesn't matter for any decent player. You WILL get headshot from 200m away with a pistol or rifle. Even if there is damage falloff, damage is damage and people WILL hit you. This brings point number 2.

2. Removing bloom promotes camping and defensive play. Fortnite has a lot of open space and people are moving quite a lot. Currently people are not afraid of moving between cities because of the bloom. We all know snipers are hard to hit and other weapons will miss a lot. This allows some time to retaliate or build and promotes more aggressive play. This way of playing goes away the moment guns are accurate. Running in the space becomes a death sentence if other players have a line of sight.

3. You win Fortnite matches by having better position, outbuilding and outplaying your opponents. Shooting them is only secondary. Before taking your weapon out you choose your position. You build to have the high ground or get on a roof. Maybe you try to destroy your enemy's building to make him fall. Or set traps for him. Only once your strategy is in place and you have a good position do you take your weapon to shoot. This matters because bloom is usually irrelevant when you outplay your enemy. He will die before knowing what happened.

4. Aiming for the head lowers your chance of hitting your enemy. Not because it's harder to put your cursor on the head, but you increase the area where the bullet can miss your target. This is counter intuitive since headshots do more damage, however you need to adapt your shooting depending on the distance. The further you are from your enemy, the more you should aim in the center of mass. Hitting for 33dmg with an AR is still better than 0 because you aimed for the head.

5. ""Fortnite cannot be competitive with bloom"". Who gives a shit ? No one asked for Fortnite to be a competitive game. Mario Odyssey isn't competitve, does that make it a bad game ? Hell no. It's ok for Fortnite to stay an extremely fun and casual game. Multiplayer != competitive.

6. This game isn't CSGO or Quake. This has to be said because a vocal minority wants to change Fortnite to be like other games. ""Other games do it like this"" is not an argument. CSGO is a highly competitive game where fights happen in a few 100 milliseconds. This is not the case for Fortnite and again, you compare two different games with entirely different objectives.

7. Aimbots are much less efficient. While this is not a strong argument, it's still an added bonus of the feature. Aimbots cannot compensate for the bloom and they will still miss far away shots.

The limited test that was done a few weeks (a month ?) ago was a failure in my opinion. In less than a day you saw multiple videos of people getting 4-5 headshots in a row with a pistol from 100m away. Most problems mentioned above happened and I suspect that's why Epic did not make a move yet on this.

My only hope if that Epic Games does not listen to the very vocal minority whining. Fortnite is extremely popular as it is and it does not have to change to cater to a small minority that want to change this game to something it is not.",FortNiteBR

2. I sniped my opponent for 130-ish damage and then rushed them and got another 2 body hits in with a uncommon hunting rifle (it was snipers only). Again got killed in one hit 

3. The person in third place essentially kamikazed with a rocket launcher and knocked be down to 10 health whilst also killing himself. The last guy was afk but I just barely died in the storm because of being so low on health

4. The closest was when my opponent had 2 health left. Again I got 4 shots off with my shotgun and he killed me in hit with a pump. I would have got the killing blow as well but he moved behind a trash can and my shot destroyed that and didn't touch him 

I just can't seem to win and it's usually in situations where I get in more hits and play better than my opponent but they get a lucky one hit kill and barely survive. Am I just that bad at the game?

They can also give feedback on the changes before they reach live s%%%%rs. Most popular online games do this so they don't bring out unintentional bugs they missed. 

I don't know when exactly a patch is finished and you're just waiting to release it, so I can't suggest an exact timeframe.

Instead, my biggest issue with it, is how it promotes camping. You can already see the front page littered with guided missle posts, and every single one has a theme. 2-4 guys camping in base raining rocket after rocket. Is this what Epic wants end game to be? They have openly stated that they are doing things to ensure the game doesnt become ""Base Wars"" but yet this is what the meta is shifting to. On top of that, the Justification that the gun leaves you helpless was good in theory, but doesnt actually happen. This is especially seen in squads where a team can build a base and watch over you, along with the fact that you can detach at any point really makes this gun risk free, if people do even push at your team.

Because of this almost all late game will be campfests. You have no incentive not to sit in your base and fire rocket after rocket. On top of that rockets can hit from above which makes being out in the open extremely dangerous anyway. Why run around and have to constantly build 1x1's with roofs every 10-15 seconds as rockets are shot toward you. Why risk that when you can build a base and open and close a roof.

I know its only been 2 days but I'm very surprised the devs pushed this weapon through. They do everything to make this game not ""Base wars"" (reducing mats, etc), but i think this one slipped through and although itll be fun, i can already see this making for a stale late game. Pushing, enemies late game will become more difficult and less fruitful and a camping meta will start to form.

I know ill definently get some hate because ""Its been 1-2 day, everyone says every new gun is OP/Bad for the game at first."" Just wanna make it clear that i dont think the gun is very OP especially with a few minor tweaks, but the play style change it causes is the problem.

They're not necessary and would they really be missed? Think about it, this will create less saturation of Shotguns around the map and in people's loadouts, putting more emphasis on SMGs and other close quarters weapons. It will also make shotgun battles more consistent because if there's an issue with the pump then guess what, I know that my opponent has the same issues as I do.

Part 2: So these issues started because players found a loophole around the fire rate of the Pump, and the devs attempted to find a solution for the double pump. Now weapon fire rates are screwed up and it's unreliable.

My solution: replace the Pump with an alternate version of the same shotgun, where instead of the gap in the fire rate coming after each shot, it comes BEFORE. Think railgun here, where you charge the shot first then release to fire. I think this would increase the skill gap a bit and make shotgun fights more interesting, while also keeping other weapons as a viable option to counter the Pump if you don't have one.

  If the devs want to strike down Tilted, it may lose its definability as the game. Now, let‚Äôs discuss the next area. Loot Lake.

  It‚Äôs the worst spot to land in because of the water and you will always be seen because of that. My theory is that the Meteor will strike down Loot Lake, and the water will be drained, and it will flood the surround areas. 

  Also notice the fact that Loot Lake moves out in to various rivers.

  These rivers will be flooded if such an event happens. But, it won‚Äôt hit Tilted Towers because of this very reason. Because Tilted is on high ground.

 Let‚Äôs also look at all the stuff that was released in 3.0-3.4.1.

 Double Pump nerf
 Space theme battle pass
  Remote Explosives
  Llamas
  Hunting Rifle
  Jetpack (though unknown when)
  Guided Missile Launcher
 

If you take the first letter of all of these, you get DSRLHJG. 

Rearrange the letters, and you get DSLR HGJ.

DSLR- High Graphic J-Cut.

  Another theory with this is that the telescopes seen are High Graphic DSLR cameras in disguise specifically made to take J-Cuts and collect data on the Meteor, AND the surrounding rivers.

But yeah, that‚Äôs all I have for now. I‚Äôm positive I missed things. 

Tl;dr- meteor will strike Loot Lake, telescopes are just high graphic DSLRs ~~and why the fuck did I make this~~

The arrival of telescopes and the fact that the battle pass is spaced themed lead me to believe that once it hits the map will become space themed and the whole game will be changed. This would link to the low gravity game mode files found and the shaking of your controller at random areas. Also why would the climbing mountains challenge lead you to telescopes which are looking directly at this meteor and how the battle pass skins are linked to a disaster with Rust Lord looking like somebody living during the aftermath of this disaster and Dark Voyager being somebody currently in the disaster whilst the first astronaut skin given to you is everyone escaping.Hopefully eerie music is implemented, loading screen will be space themed and special challenges linking to the meteor making the game storyline esque.

It encourages camping and has an extreme distance that it can cover. That distance needs to be reduced imo, a single rocket can travel so far it‚Äôs laughable. And while camping isn‚Äôt a bad thing in a battle royale game, being able to sit in a metal tower far away from anyone spamming the missile is frustrating for the opponent. 

It‚Äôs also very difficult to shoot the missile down and if you build, it can go around the wall. If you successfully block it  by quickly building a 1x1, you‚Äôll still take splash damage, and before you can get out of the 1x1 to advance to the enemy, he has already fired another guided missile.

Please, leave the range alone and do these 4 things...

1.  Increase the volume so when one is in the sky, almost everybody knows about it.  Right now it surprises too many people.

2.  Decrease its health from 100hp to 50hp.

3.  Increase the reload time by 1 or 2 seconds.

4.  On PC, the rockets agility is way too high.  Make it so the rocket turns like a boat, like it does on PS4 and XBox.

I did some research and some people have also got hacked by the same people and had their card used. Mostly through paypal like me and trust me... paypal won't deny their case so you be stuck with either your bank or through epicgames. I know the epic game managers are nice but with a huge influx of people getting hacked... I figured this PSA would scare and prevent some of these accidents.

301,rwp80,1522399654,888yh0,37,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/888yh0/the_building_spam_meta_will_kill_fortnite_br_in/,0,The Building Spam Meta will kill Fortnite BR in the long run. It can be prevented.,"The ""building spam"" meta ruins Fortnite.

My prediction is that by 2020 (possibly sooner) Fortnite's popularity will begin to wane, and after a bit of introspection they will come to realize that the root cause of the decline in popularity is the building spam meta.
The building spam meta is the glass ceiling (pun!) that stops normal players from being able to compete effectively against the more hardcore players, and the majority of players will start to gravitate away from Fortnite if this isn't rebalanced sooner rather than later.

I regularly finish top 10 but I have never won a solo match.
Why? Because every time I get to the last 10, the building spam meta overwhelms the lategame.
If you like the building spam meta, then good for you - Enjoy it while you can.

Sure, it feels fresh and 'innovative' now, but really all Epic did was borrow existing game features from their co-op mode and shove it into battle royale. It's going to need an extreme facelift to stop it from quickly devolving into a niche 'building-spam' game with a small audience.

Buildings can exist comfortably in Fortnite BR for the mainstream player, but it needs a few small tweaks:

**1. Only you should see the blue ""ghost"" of buildings that you and your teammates place.**
It doesn't make sense that your enemies can see what is *going to* happen by your action. Spamming buildings just to get the instant blue ghost cover completely ruins mid-range combat, because it instantly obscures you from the enemy.

**2. There should be a one-second delay before each structure starts building when placed OR no structures insta-start with parts built.**
Similar problem as above, except it's worse - Placed walls actually start instantly with some parts built, so this insta-wall actually absorbs incoming shots from the very instant it's placed, even before it finishes building. When engaging an enemy you end up spending more time shooting down the insta-pop-up walls, rather than actually shooting at the enemy. It comes down to a completely pointless contest of who has more ammo versus more building materials.

**3. A structure shouldn't support other structures until it's finished building.**
How can a wall rest on top of *the ghost* of a previous unfinished wall?! Sure, sprint up a staircase of ghost stairs... Ugh.
Instant ghost walls... Feels more like a puzzle platformer than a strategic BR game.

**4. To balance the above tweaks, make buildings cost 4 times as much, but 8-12 times stronger to prevent your strategic walls and stairs being insta-blown-up.** (But also make rockets stronger vs structures to keep rockets relevant)
Now when you build a wall, it stays a wall!

Just take a step back and give this whole issue an honest thought. If you had never heard of Fortnite BR and just read the first 3 points above, would you even want to play it at all?!
Saying it's 'innovative' falls completely lame, unless they *intended* for building spam to be the gameplay style? (I doubt it!)

If you're reading this in the future and they didn't kill the building spam meta, then all I can say is ""I told you so!""

I hope they do fix it because the building-spam issue is the only thing stopping Fortnite from being easily the best ever BR game, and overall one of the best FPS games ever.

**T L ; D R**
Stop the gameplay-ruining building spam meta in BR with a few good small tweaks.

While that seems like a good idea, I feel like hat we really need a victory shop amidst the current shop setup.

Battle passes are great, and offer amazing skins for grind, but there will always be that 45% that just buys $60 of vbucks and buys until the last tier, making other players think he is a god at fortnite but in actuality he is just loaded.

Black Knight was supposed to be a sign of power, but so many people have it because they paid for it, not earnt it from grinding. The idea is that every game, if you win [Squad, Duo, Solo, LTM] you get a victory ticket. This victory ticket can be used in a special Victory Store, where 3 items are featured daily.

One item for 10 Tickets, one for 25, and one for 50. On Sundays maybe add one that costs 100. These items can be back blings, picks, gliders and skins, and can only be bought with victory tickets. Victory tickets cannot be purchased with real money or with v-bucks.

The skins do not have to be as good as the event skins, or certain legendary ones, but at least give the players who are grinding for that win a chance to show everyone they are good. No one takes john wicks, or black knights seriously and that sucks. Having a skin or pick from the victory store is proof you might actually be good.

Agreed 10% of people will end up bush camping for a desperate win, and another 10% will buy people to carry them, but this is better than being able to straight up buy your way to the elite skins.

However, both Duos or Squads have been ruined when the enemy has this item. 

Next, I‚Äôm going to post my stats, not to prove that im some sort of pro; because I‚Äôm not. But to prove that I am fully aware how the game should be played and I‚Äôd like to think im at least decent. 

https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/ZagerThaGod

Okay, The Guided Missile in Duos and squads is overpowered because ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù just simply doesnt work. If i push, i have to immediately stop and build an ENTIRE box including roof just to defend against 1 rocket, not to mention, the enemies are spam shooting my walls down as the other guy drives around for 13 seconds trying to find even the slightest angle to hit me at. 

‚Äúshoot it down‚Äù the problem with this is weapons have bloom and the rocket has 100hp, if you try and shoot rather than building the full box around yourself than you run the risk of missing and getting hit even if your ‚Äúaccuracy‚Äù for whatever thats worth in this game is perfect. 

Basically, if you sit in a box with a roof over your head until he runs out of rockets you‚Äôre good. Otherwise, youre basically screwed. 

‚ÄúHe cant move‚Äù but his other 1 or 3 teammates can depending on Duos or Squads &amp; ive seen all sorts of combinations on squads..
- 2 Guided Missiles and 2 people shooting and you practically cant move. 
- 1 Guided Missile and 1 real RPG on top of 1 Grenade Launcher
- 1 Guided Missile and 1 Grenade Launcher 

You can simply just push a team while your teammate uses the Guided Missile and the guy driving the Missile pretty much has free targets to hit. 

Overall, the weapon is a meme, its cool for clips, but ruins the game, gameplay wise. Its so far in outfield and totally unnecessary to have in the game. We already have rockets, we already have grenade launchers, we already have c4s, we already have grenades...explosives come in abundance, why have a rocket launcher that can drive around for 13 seconds and hit from any angle. 


Lastly, THIS IS ON PC. The reason i say this is because i know (or at least ive heard) driving the guided missile on console is way ‚Äúharder‚Äù or maybe ‚Äúlimited‚Äù is a better word than on PC. On PC you can make sharp turns and basically drive it like its a vehicle with a mouse. ",FortNiteBR

Now people can sit in the comfort of their base while they scout the entire area and get super easy kills. 

If this thing is gonna stay in the game, it needs a serious nerf. 18 seconds is wayyy too long of a fuse. You can fly across nearly a quarter of the entire map in that time. 10 seconds would be *plenty* of time. The turning radius needs a severe nerf as well. The rockets are way too agile. Finally, there should be a smoke trail coming from the rockets' exhaust to allow players to see where the rocket was originally fired from.

&gt;But the homing missile leaves the user completely vulnerable while in use!

That doesn't mean anything if you don't know the location of the user in the first place. And most players are smart enough to not leave themselves exposed while they use it. I can just chill at the top of the mountain near Tilted Towers and rain down hellfire on everyone in the area without my location being compromised. 

While we're on the topic of explosives, why not give the grenade launcher a little love? It's outclassed by the other launchers in almost every way.

I have still won in this state but the amount of times that this has caused me to choke the game infuriates me!

I hate when people say ""just don't get nervous, be confident."" But this is more than just getting nervous because I'm sure even pro players do. This is triggered by intense anxiety and without a xanax I can't seem to get rid of it. I do smoke a lot of weed but while I'll be less anxious, it still creeps up on me.

Now I don't think the option should be removed. Instead, I believe players that have a keyboard and mouse connected to their console should be placed on PC servers against other players who have the same advantages.

I'm on this subreddit all the time, so I knew exactly what happened.

Someone hacked my account and bought $100 of V-Bucks on the account yesterday. The big issue is, it isn't my debit card. My dad let me get V-bucks using his card over a month ago, and the saved card info was enough for the hacker to just buy the V-Bucks. So I don't have the necessary ""TRANSACTION STATEMENT LINE DESCRIPTOR"" to file a dispute, and he can't figure out how to find that without my mom who is at work. 

I had a pretty secure password on that account, but since I caught the problem I changed my password and added two-factor authentication. I'm just really disappointed that there weren't any security measures during checkout to deter people who don't actually have the card.

Sorry for venting, I hope this doesn't get deleted for breaking rules. I'm just super pissed that this happened and it sucks that my parents are the ones suffering from some hacker A-hole.

Edit for the rude people: I didn‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôm the one who found it, and let them know. No one is ‚Äúcaught‚Äù. I‚Äôm just frustrated because I want a refund for my parents so they don‚Äôt have to do this shit thought their credit card.

Edit 2: I'm not some kid trying to place blame. I'm 26, and wouldn't spend $100 on cosmetics on any game probably ever.

I was hoping v3.4 would fix this issue, but it still exists. I've gone through all the FAQ and documentation on the subject.  I've come to the conclusion that if you have ""FAMILY"" accounts on the Xbox, cross platform play only works if the Adult account is signed into the Xbox One.  The child account can sign into the PC and then successfully join the party.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work in reverse (which I'm guessing is more common -- as adults we want to play on the PC and our kids want to play on Xbox/console).  I've gone through my sons ""family enabled"" xbox live account, and changed all xbox privacy, content restrictions, and web filter settings to be as open as possible. Comparing every screen with my ""adult"" account, and it still doesn't let me (as the adult account on the PC) join my son (as the child account on the Xbox).  The first time we tried it, my son was set for content suitable up to 10 years old, and had some privacy settings set to ""Block"".  Even after changing all of those and lifting all restrictions, I guess Epic assumes ""once a child, always a child"".  My son can play Battle Royale without an issue, he just can't participate in cross platform lobbies if his account is signed in on the Xbox.

But if we switch the accounts, and I just sign in as my son on the PC, and he signs in as me on the Xbox, it works flawlessly.  So my account has the coveted ""Enable Cross Platform Parties"" options in the settings menu under Game.  But my sons account does not, and it never ""pops-up"" on the first connection.  None of his Epic Games account friends can connect to him if they are connecting from PC.  Yet if he signs in as an Adult account (ie; mine), they all can.

Epic, please let us know what setting is controlling this, and why it works on Adult accounts but not Family accounts.

Thank you.",FortNiteBR

After previously only having played PUBG, there are definitely some benefits that makes Fortnite a lot more fun and appealing. The pace of the game is a lot faster and exciting, the game runs smooth as butter, the looting is less complicated and easier so you can jump right into battles.

The problem I can't even begin to understand is how fucking lame building seems to be. There's just something massively unappealing about players only having to spend 60 seconds smacking a tree to gain essentially endless cover and endless protection from any angle they are getting shot from. 

Maybe this is how the intended design is supposed to be, but for me personally it kills any motivation I have to keep playing. If I spot another player and they decide to replace the same wood wall over and over again, there's no tactical response available besides rushing them with a shotgun. I think this is the real reason why shotguns seem to be hated so much in general. The long range engagements in PUBG are some of the most fun I have, but building again completely ruins this aspect in Fortnite. Not to mention the snipers and rifles are massively underpowered in comparison.

It seems like this really lame aspect could be easily changed by doing several easy changes. Lower the supply cap on building material you can carry, make ammo more available in general so walls can properly be destroyed, or make wood much weaker than brick or metal. Maybe I just don't understand why things are the way they are.",FortNiteBR

""But timer is too long"" Well either that or make the rocket faster, because making the timer shorter while making the rocket go the same speed is absolutely useless.
Epic made the rocket slow for a reason, so it can be shot down.
Only idiot players will see a rocket coming at them and not try to shoot it. So stop complaining and start learning, if Epic listened to you guys all the time there would be no game at all.
I rest my case.",FortNiteBR

Edit2: oh, I guess I'm stupid and my opinion is wrong, cool. Point taken

It was requested on this sub a couple of times, so it's cool that it's coming, but not if not everybody can use it.

Until now, skins and emotes were only cosmetic. But this emote can change that. Ofcourse, it isn't something really big, but you can't deny that having such an emote gives you an advantage. 

This emote offers a new way to communicate with your team: but only if you paid for it.

What if more emotes like this would get added? Let's say an emote that would mean: 'I nead ammo' or 'I need meds. Would you be ok with it if you need to pay for such emotes?

Now, ofcourse you don't have to agree with it since these are just my thoughts. But maybe some of you agree and also hope this won't happen.

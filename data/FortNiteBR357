No matter if someone is standing behind them with a shotgun, a lot of players will die focusing on finishing the kill.

Furthermore, sometimes a member in your squads lands at a spot with no gun, and they get insta-downed and then killed before they have a chance to fight back.

The problem with this system is that even if your team wins your landing spot now, you are without a teammate, and you will likely suffer from fewer numbers in the endgame. Also, often times a player will die by making sure they kill a downed player to screw over the team that outplayed their team in the city.

A possible change I suggest is for them to set a short timer where downed players cant be shot to death at the beginning of the game. They will still slowly tick and die, so getting them back is a priority. However, this will allow the winning team of a landing spot to revive their team at the end and leave the town with a full squad. 

Otherwise, it encourages teams that want to be competitive for a win to land out in the middle of nowhere so that they can keep their whole squad alive. Four members with gray loot is better than one member with all legendarys.




TLDR; Even the best teams can lose a member at the beginning of a game by a quick down/instakill at their landing spot. A short anti-down-kill timer would encourage team vs. team fights at the beginning instead of finishing downed enemies to screw over your opponents even after you lose.",FortNiteBR

We all feel this game has the same amount of fun compared to when we played Battlefield squads years ago. However, as time went by, we all ended up having more responsibilities, both socially and financially, such as college and work. In my case I have an income which allows me to expend on games and some of college education.

Today when I logged in, I saw several text notifications from my bank, about online transactions that I have not taken part of. I Jumped out of my bed as soon as possible and saw that my account had 14000 V-bucks, and all the current skins in the store. Besides seeing my bank account balance to be almost completely gone, I now run the risk of not paying this month’s payment for college.

I do not understand the fun in hacking someone else’s account simply to make their life harder, using my own money to buy skins that I did not want and possibly using in-game cheats and messing up people’s lives.

I removed all my credit cards from my accounts, changed my passwords and had to ask for a refund via a ticket. Either way, even if the refund gets requested, I will not have it in time to pay my college.

So,if possible,can i get some upvotes for visibility?i have no options,i really need that money back for my college payment.

I think it is fair to say that most people are sprinting 95% of the time or more. We shouldn't have to hold or press a key to sprint. We should have to **hold a key to walk**, since it is the more uncommon movement method.

Take for example every other shooter on the market. The only time sprint should be set to a key press is when the sprint is exhaustible (i.e., it runs out and has to be recharged). Can you imagine if you had to hold a key to move faster in a game like CSGO? I couldn't. It also feels natural to press a key to walk in CSGO.

For those of you that will point out that there is a ""toggle sprint"" option. That is not what this post is about and it does not solve the issue. With toggle sprint, sprint is disengaged on almost every action, and you have to press the sprint button to initiate it again. It is not fluid at all.

Threads on this topic have been posted before but I think it is worth repeating as it would be a valuable addition to the game and would make movement more fluid in general. It would also open up a valuable key (Shift for most people) to be bound to something more important, like building.

I believe this should at very least be an option in the game if it is not set as the default.

If you're just a lurker, or you don't know how to solve the issue yourself, please either upvote this post or share it or something to make it potentially visible to those who do know how to solve this issue.  Any help or exposure is much appreciated.

I began playing Fortnite a few months back with my friends.  The first time I played was on my PS4, but I quickly moved to PC once I realized that the game was cross\-platform \(my friends play on PS4 so I could still play with them even on PC\).  However, I am still in school and I needed to take some time away from gaming and focus on schoolwork for a little bit.  Once my load lightened up, I found myself with some free time, and I decided I wanted to play FN again.  This was about a month ago.  However, when I logged on, I would get [stuttering](https://streamable.com/0j2kc).  It wasn't any, ""go away after 30 seconds"" stuttering or any sort of temporary stuttering; it stuck.  I had around 30ms ping, and there were no major jumps as seen in the first frames on the video linked above. The problem is still occurring.  Since the beginning of it, I have done everything imaginable in trying to solve it.  

**Basic information:**

 I am running Windows 10 on my custom\-built PC that I built back in September of 2017.  I am fairly certain that the issue is not FPS related \(no stuttering occurs when connected via Ethernet\).  My system has an i7 7700k and a GTX 1070 with 16GB of DDR4 RAM base\-clocked at 3000MHZ.  I am upstairs in my house and I have no way of permanently routing an Ethernet cable into my PC from my router which is downstairs.  So, when I bought all of my parts for my PC, I picked up a USB WiFi adapter.  The setup was quite simple and every game I ran had no connection problems whatsoever \(including Fortnite... until recently of course\).  You may be thinking that this is the problem, but I have a reason to believe otherwise as I will explain later.

**The following is a list of everything I can remember trying since the hitching started \(note that none of these solved anything\):**

\- Manually changed in\-game server from ""Auto"" to ""NA\-East"" \(I live in New England\)

\- Restarted Fortnite

\- Restarted Epic Games Launcher

\- Rebooted Router

\- Rebooted PC

\- Changed the WiFi adapter's USB slot multiple times

\- Verified Fortnite files

\- Updated graphics drivers \(they were already up to date...\)

\- Downgraded graphics drivers to a release date before the issue started happening

\- Updated all of the drivers from my motherboard

\- Updated BIOS \(yes, I went this far just to get this game working\)

\- Manually set my router's channel to be ""11"", the strongest channel according to a WiFi analyzer

\- Uninstalled and reinstalled the game

\- Uninstalled and reinstalled Epic Game Launcher and the game \(everything to do with FN\)

**I finally decided to troubleshoot the root of the problem in terms of hardware:**

I remembered that I had an old laptop from 2013 that I had recently brought back to life, so I decided to download FN on this laptop to see if the stuttering occurred on it.  I connected to the same WiFi that my main PC was connected to using the default WiFi chip in the laptop, and sure enough I got no stuttering.  I also did the testing in the same location of my main PC experiencing the stuttering problem.  As a side note, I'm not using that laptop to play FN because it can't run things too well anymore, so I was getting like 30 FPS on low settings \(not suitable\).  Then, I thought that maybe it was the USB WiFi adapter.  So, I tried plugging the adapter that I use in my main PC, into the laptop and made sure that the laptop was receiving a connection via this adapter and not the built\-in chip.  Yet again, a flawless connection with no stuttering in sight.  So, this allowed me to deduce that the USB WiFi adapter was not the problem \(I figured that it was fine because, like I said, every other game worked\).  This laptop test also revealed that it was most likely not an Epic Games server issue, because I would have seen stuttering on my laptop.  Also, for the sake of experimentation I temporarily routed an Ethernet cable all the way up to my PC and I got no stuttering.  However, as mentioned previously, I can't keep my PC wired to my router because there are no permanent wire\-routing solutions in my current living space.

**Conclusion:**

It seems as though something is either wrong with my PC \(settings or something\), the compliance between my PC and the WiFi adapter \(all of a sudden and in one game? not likely...\), or there is something evil going on here.  Thanks for reading and I will be sure to add any clarifying points needed.  Any help would really be appreciated.",FortNiteBR

The object in the sky is almost definitely a spaceship.","For those of you who aren't aware, BR and STW share the same ""comet"" in the sky. However in this week's STW update we got a further storyline to a character Lars, whose friend has gone missing.

**In the earlier part Lars literally mentions that something from space is trying to communicate with the ""husks"" (STW zombies). The guy is pretty shocked after he saw something in the sky, and the only way to examine it is using telescopes. The ""object in the sky"" is also transmitting signals**, and as a quest us players had to gather a lot of mechanical stuff for it. The new Cyberpunk heroes launched in STW also have a sci-fi theme to them.

I don't think after all this, that object in the sky is just a comet, and given how Epic is and how hyped the community is about this, it's definitely not just a rock falling on the island.

It's most probably a spacecraft, and Lars' friend has gone missing due to an alien abduction. 

About the spacecraft landing, if any place, it would be Lucky ""Landing"". It was a Chinese New Year location, so it would make sense to not have it permanently. This week's Battle Pass challenge also refers to eliminations in Lucky Landing. Having some sort of wild alien towers POI south would also balance the map, since nobody really lands in that direction.

Epic is throwing huge hints towards an alien-based Season 4.

Now for the main part.

Sure you'll be able to make a few V-Bucks in the beginning, but that game is a grind. It takes a lot of time to earn V buck after some levels.

But the game is really worth it but that's another topic.

And if you're waiting for the free version so you can earn V-Bucks without being a founder, we'll from a logical point of view, when the game rolls out for free, you won't be able to earn V-Bucks unless you buy the founder pack. It would be way too easy.

My opinion :

To tell you the truth, I went on STW because I wanted to earn V bucks, but I actually like PvE. So I went on STW for the V bucks, but stayed on it because it is so much fun and the grind is real.

I can't drop tilted anymore because all kids do is grab a shotgun and peek around a corner. No one uses rifles, smgs, or pistols. People ignore the grenades and crossbows. The shotgun is the only weapon I ever see someone use aside from a sniper or a rifle when they feel safe enough to use it. Otherwise it's just rush with a shotgun or sit and aim where the head should be.

It takes the fun out of the game... I shouldn't play 15 matches just to die 14 times to a child who uses mommies credit card and had a 20 dollar skin, 20 dollar glider, and 15 dollar pickaxe, and sits in the corner of a tilted building with his Lil pump and just yeets all over me even if I outplay and out build him.

Not only has that not been confirmed by any source anywhere, it wouldn't be the first time we've got something all wrong. Remember folks, upvotes and downvotes are not indicators of truth, only popularity.

First off, here's the tweet [https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/987149645838200833](https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/987149645838200833). Epic has given exactly two sentences/phrases on the subject. First, they said *""The Battle Bus is taking off!"".* Second, they said *""Destination: China.""*

Second, here are two articles that run in entirely different directions with this.

[https://www.vg247.com/2018/04/20/fortnite\-china/](https://www.vg247.com/2018/04/20/fortnite-china/)

[http://www.newsweek.com/fortnite\-battle\-bus\-china\-april\-23\-new\-map\-894726](http://www.newsweek.com/fortnite-battle-bus-china-april-23-new-map-894726)

Third, there are plenty of reasons to believe both, and I also think they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive theories. Here's a quick breakdown:

**FORTNITE IS SHIPPING TO CHINA LITERALLY**

**Evidence For**

* Obviously a huge money market
* Is a quasi\-Occam's razor for Epic's second sentence
* Fortnite has released patches with other languages before

**Evidence Against**

* Does not inherently explain the comet or anything related to that
* Fortnite's servers haven't had the best track records as of late, and China is a *huge* player base
* Does not explain Epic's first sentence. Could be a corny marketing line, but it could also be interpreted literally.
* Does not explain the ambiguous nature of Epic's tweet.
* The current Chinese assets are a little too stereotype. Might be insensitive to release to China with all the red dragon stuff \(the equivalent in the U.S. would be akin to Epic releasing a bunch of fat characters and burger and cowboy skins right before the game dropped here\).

**FORTNITE'S MAP IS CHANGING TO CHINA**

**Evidence For**

* We've had Chinese New Year assets before
* Is a quasi\-Occam's razor for Epic's first sentence and the use of a passport in the Tweet's photo.
* Ties into the comet destroying the map and gives us a reason to leave
* Is a more fulfilling delivery on all the hype lately \(it isn't exactly exciting to the current player base to just have more players\)
* Could add a breath of fresh air to the increasingly dense current map.
* Chinese design assets fit better with this move then moving to China. Could actually be kinda racist if that's how they celebrate the China release.

**Evidence Against**

* Epic has said, repeatedly, that they see no reason for a new map.
* Tilted Towers fanboys would spontaneously combust.

**FORTNITE IS SHIPPING TO CHINA** ***AND*** **THE MAP IS CHANGING TO CHINA**

**Evidence For**

* There's nothing saying that it can't be both.
* We have a new season/battle pass coming
* Would be a far more appropriate celebration of the new market rather than the tired model of adding new skins and such.
* It wouldn't be the first time that a game company has lied about something to intentionally throw its players off the scent.
* Still gives us a reason for the comet.
* Still reaches a new money market.

**Evidence Against**

* Again, the servers would most likely explode.
* Again, Titled fans would be sad.
* Could be too much change for the waning players to stay on for.

With all that being said, realize that there are good reasons to think that this may not so cut and dry. And maybe the saltier members of our community might want to hush for now and see what comes on 4/23/18. I'd hate to be ripping people apart for choosing one theory over the other, then being dead wrong. Let's continue to enjoy the lighthearted theories and realize that, until Epic clarifies or 4/23 comes, we are firmly in the realm of speculation.

I have a question to anybody that can help me out.

I play Fortnite Br since it came out on Ps4 and ive been enjoying it every day.
I switched from default to Combat Pro back in February and im loving it ever since. Only recently ive been feeling more confident in my building/rushing playstyle thanks to Combat Pro.

That being said, when i first looked at Building Pro i thought it would be amazing to learn to play. But when i tried it i couldnt find my turn i guess and after an hour or so i jumped back in Combat Pro. Mainly because of two things :
First i find it a bit odd that we canot custom remap our building choises, so instead its one choise only per button, wich is nice i guess but still isnt there for me.
Second and most important for me is that every time i choose a building piece ( platform, wall etc. ) i have to press it twice to switch and then place it. Wich is exactly the same as in Combat Pro.

For anyone whos been using Building Pro and switched from Combat Pro : Can you honestly see a diference in your building speed/mobility? Is it so much better i should just adjust my self into it? 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and excuse my typos :) ( english isnt my main tounge )

However Fortnite for some reason makes my Graphics Card heat extremely bad, even sitting in the lobby screen can make it go to 75+ degrees, and in-game even more. After few gaming sessions I can hear my PC fans being loud due due to how GPU intensive this game is.

The funny thing is Fortnite isn't even a demanding game, so I don't get why it heats my GPU so much, I play much more demanding ones like PUBG and Overwatch and it doesn't go even near to the levels of Fortnite, which is why this problem is kinda weird. (My fortnite is capped at 144 FPS to not make the problem even worse)

Sometimes the game might even crash from the GPU being unstable, however ever since I deeply cleaned my PC internals it happens less. (So dust isn't my problem)

**TL;DR - Fortnite makes my GPU heat much more than other more demanding games do, sometimes even to the point the game crashes. It's not a dust problem.**

Im a console pleb obviously and I mainly use shotguns in the game and I win 9 outta 10 of my gun fights IF the fight is within my range i rarely miss my pump shots but I'm rather a slow builder when comparing to some other more skilled players also I'm quite bad with ARs in long distance battles so I would rely on snipers on that department.
I've been wondering should I increase my sensitivity to 8 or 9 and try to start fresh learning how to adapt in order to build faster or should I just stay with 5 (my current sensitivity) to win most of my shotgun battles and rely completely in close combat scenarios? The reason I am asking is because building is a very important aspect in the game and since I'm lacking building speed I thought I should seek some advices and suggestions from this subreddit.

Personally I don’t think it’s really fair that a shotgun should do 200+ damage and here’s why.
So as you know the “Pump Shotgun” has a mechanic that basically multiplies the damage that you would do in a full headshot, let’s say that young John Wick hits you with a pump shot over your body and the HP that is taken from you is at least 70 and 90. I think it’s fair, but when you hit a full (bullet) headshot the damage multiplier becomes active and the 120 or 100 damage that a headshot should take is multiplied by 2 and the result is 240 or 200 damage... which you automatically die without even responding. 

That’s unfair (personally) because I think each individual should have the chance of responding equally to the fight. If you do 200 damage to a guy  he automatically die without even fighting back. 

Let’s say that you are in a fight and you panic and the guy that you are fighting don’t panic but he has a lower quality shotgun than you have, you panic and luckily hit a full headshot with pump... he dies without even showing is potencial. 

Even tho I know the game is based on luck I don’t think that the guns should be based on luck because building and fighting should be a tool of experience and thus not about luck and more about skill.

No one likes farming for 10min.,"we've reached that point where players are getting better .. please for the love of god Epic ... literally everyone has to farm to 999 wood anyway , the only thing that better material collection rate could change is that people don't have to sleep for 10+ min collecting materials .. 

Everyone is saying : Tilted destroys the mid game and make it boring... but the problem is that EVERYONE is collecting mats in the mid game ...  

Go watch almost any game in your replay and you're gonna notice that players are really close to eachother but have no idea since most of the time, 80% of their screen is covered by a tree.. Or they simply don't want to engage without mats .

Blitz fixed those problems (along with every LTM that came with enhanced mats) (paired with more agressive mid game circle, but circle didn't changed a lot to the pace except fucking people that had bad circle RNG imo) every part of the game was litt:         

**-Early game** : you had mats to actually have a skillfull fights filled with really interesting outplays in the early game           

**-Mid game** : like I said , instead of just collecting mats, people were fighting since they actually saw eachother
                    
**-End game** : recovering from a fight with a good player wasn't as detrimental since you could farm up mats to a point where you're good enough to fight

We're starting to notice that you want to slow the pace of the game to make it more casual-friendly .. but literally no one likes to farm for that long and there is literally no counter argument for it.

- the 50 v 50 collection rate is not as huge as blitz, but it's still insanely better than Live , tbh +75% could be perfect , even +55%-65% if you don't want to make a sudden big change (even if you did in the past with first shot accuracy and swapping delays)

We have to give props to epic because they used most of the good feedback from the community after v1 - sadly the new 50vs50 is still nothing like we picture / wish

its basicaly fortnite without any early game and no mid game 

you can land in or close to the circle - have to compete with your own team for loot 
OR land two town away and have the game be decided ( 36 v 12 ) before you even see your first ennemy 

after about 5 wins in a row i realised the only way to have fun with it is to challenge yourself to get as many kills as you can - playing it risky and leading the charge ( not playing as its meant to be played ) 

the whole game takes place in a small circle thats pre-decided - i get thats because epic wanted to have people all stuck together - but with that and the line in the middle the whole map is empty - people dont use that time to build the big forts we all want to see but instead the circle becomes a laggy mess of ramps 

the whole gamemode is as casual as it can be and also happens to bring the worst behavior out of people - its populated by kids and other bad players so as a side effect the other normal games modes aslo become try hard land 

Im curious to see what you guys think about this - if there is a way this game mode can be even a little less boring or broken 

the only way i can see this working in a v3 is having a pre-dertermined attacking and defending team - the defending team will drop right on top of the circle and will stay there - the attacking team will have to take that position away from the defenders - im not opposed to players spawing with loot &amp; mats to start with - explosives and jump pads for attackers only - a set amout of snipers for both teams - ar - meds 

could almost be quick round based games so you get to play both sides every match 

this v2 is a step in the right direction but its does not really work for a number of reasons

Whenever someone tries to snipe or spam rockets at the enemy base you just know there will be that one a-hole who somehow found 6 Impulse and would wreck the game for 20-30 others just so he can smile.

Yesterday while playing the mode there was this guy who would reach up to our sniper's nest and throw impulse nades just so he could see us flying. I got downed but was fortunately revived by another fellow sniper. We changed our place and built a new structure so that we can snipe, but loo and behold the king of douchery arrived and threw 2 impulse nades back to back and this time the entire group of like 7-8 snipers got downed because we all fell off a cliff. Nobody came to revive us and frankly it wasn't even possible as there was a lot of cross fire from the other side.

And i think i am not alone in here, there must be other people who might've experienced the same plight i have. And yes. i know there are a lot of idiots in the 50v50 mode, people who steal loot, people who break structures which causes people to fall. But frankly speaking impulse is not something we can actually react to, one second you are trying to snipe the enemy RPG hoarder and the next thing you know you are flying higher than the battle bus.

So please epic, take this little suggestion into consideration, some of us have waited for some time to get this mode back and we don't want it to be ruined by silly pranks.",FortNiteBR

Recently I managed to scrape together enough money to build a desktop PC. For some reason however, when I plug my mouse into the desktop, it interprets the thumb buttons as cursor mode inventory, which is bound to left alt. When I try to rebind the keys, Fortnite interprets both thumb buttons as being equivalent to hitting left alt on the keyboard.

*Edit for Clarity*

* I have the same mouse driver from the manufacturer installed on both laptop and desktop

* On my laptop, Fortnite recognizes the thumb buttons as ""Mouse Thumb 1"" and ""Mouse Thumb 2""

* On my desktop, Fortnite recognizes the thumb buttons as ""Left Alt""

* If I use the driver/software to change the mouse button commands, Fortnite recognizes only the first key in the equivalent key combo for the bound command. For example, Paste, Control-V, only gets recognized as ""Left Control"" in Fortnite.

**Edit 2.0**

I bound one mouse thumb button to ""Right Control"" and the other to ""Delete"". Interestingly, the Delete key works fine, but the Right Control key which registers as ""Right Control"" in the Fortnite menus, actually functions as equivalent to the ""C"" key in game. So for example, I have ""Select Building 3"" bound to C and ""Select Building 1"" bound to Right Control (which is actually Mouse Thumb 1), but both buttons behave as ""Select Building 3""

**Final Update**

Uninstalling the mouse driver and just letting Windows handle the mouse however it defaults to handling it causes Fortnite to register the mouse buttons properly as ""Mouse Thumb 1"" and ""Mouse Thumb 2""",FortNiteBR

He has supported me so much and I wish I could do something amazing for him. I don't have money to give him (and honestly he doesn't care about that).

He doesn't play Fortnite, but I am reaching out to this community because I have seen such greatness from how amazing this community is and I was hoping we could take it a step further and just go in and wish him a happy birthday. He is doing a long ass stream and it would really restore faith in the idea that a gaming community can be amazing for no reason at all other than a simple request.

Mental Health issue [serious],"Hello everyone, before I start please be gentle with your responses directed towards me. Anyways, I've been playing fortnite for the past 2 months and have been having a blast but recently have encountered some ""friends."" One is a streamer and one is a very funny guy, but it hurts and annoys me that they laugh at my mental health issue because whenever I take my medication (it is a very strong one and I am carefully monitored by my doctor as it could cause seizures) I stutter and my whole body, speech and reaction time slows down as it is a CNS depressant. I've seen numerous kinds of specialists and none of them have a clear diagnosis aside from severe anxiety which permanently excuses me from jury duty. I am a kind person at heart and during one of my friends stream a member in our squad asks for ammo and I give him the ammo he requests and as I do that I just make Chinese accents of myself (I'm Chinese), and so the squad member threatened me saying if he ever see's me in real life he will fight me. I took it as a joke at first so I responded with ""you f me up, I f u."" Not sure what I should do. Did I break any code of conduct considering I jokingly said ""you f me up, I f u."" It wasn't until later that the other squad members told me he was serious. Should I remove them as friends? Just a lot of anxiety and depression going through my mind as I am unsure if I broke a rule and will be banned as it lingers in my mind and one of those ""friends"" always wants to buy skins and wants me to log in to his account and buy it and says he'll pay me back or gift me lots of league skins, which I know is against the rules to account share. I was able to get in contact with EPIC_Joel but he doesn't handle customer support but stated that if someone is being bothersome and this was a one time thing my account should be okay as I meant no harm. Later on I get in contact with EPIC Nythanos and was told that he would be unable to comment on individual incidents, but asked to remain respectful even if it gets in the heat of the moment, so I assume that was a warning since he also stated that my account should be okay since I have blocked the player. I really enjoy fortnite but my mind always lingers in the back of head saying ""you'll get banned."" Thank you for taking the time to read this.",FortNiteBR

Let me remind you all that epic did not give me any kind of warnings aswell, which makes it so clear that they’re using Auto-Ban system ! 

The system is actually thinking that Discord mainly or any other running video games such as league of legends or overwatch is a Cheating program !!!!
Yes they think its cheating programs 

Yet epic games denny that completely which makes me and the rest of these innocet people who got banned pissed off! 

People are ready to sue epic games if they do not fix this situation cause this is unfair ! And illegal 
Mostly they’re scamming people since there are many others who bought vbucks and skins and worked their ass off in the battle pass to reach their skins and tiers !

I truly love this game, but I hate how bad I am at it! I have never played a shooter before. Mostly RPG/MMO, so this is a new experience for me. 

I get demolished so fast, and when I am trying to shoot someone, if I kill them, its honestly by luck. My curser is flying around so fast, I just can not for the life of me aim well. I have tried my controller ( scuff ps4) on sensitivity 2-6 . Terrible on all of them lol

I have tried practicing in the lobby, going out far and practicing, going to tilted over and over, etc etc. 

I know the logical and probably only real answer is to keep playing, keep practicing, but am just curious what actually worked for others.

It is like 50 v 50 is a lantern and all the potato players flock to it like bugs. This means that even one decent squad of 4 can create a 20 player disadvantage in a few minutes.

I'm not talking below average players, I'm talking people who can barely shoot and walk at the same time. Just had a 50 v 50 where I had 7 kills and then died(cause I'm not good enough and need to git gud). I spectate on to the last four players(4 v 13) all of which have zero kills, they all have low ground and all dont appear to know how to build? I literally watched one of the players miss 10+ shots with a Bolt action sniper... ON PLAYERS THAT WERE STANDING COMPLETELY STILL AND HAD NO CLUE WHERE HE WAS SNIPING FROM. I was literally speechless.

The mode is actually pretty fun I must say, but holy shit does it attract the thumbless and blind. I really wonder what 50 v 50 with good players and actual tactics would be like. That to me at least is the one thing holding this mode back. While it is nice to have a super casual LTM, it is almost as if 50 v 50 is so casual that it ruins what could be truly epic battles. 

Overall I'm not hating on the mode, just simply sharing my thoughts based on the matches that I have played. Curious as to see what everyone is thinking about this mode!",FortNiteBR

Those wins came in pretty much around the same time, but now from the insane popularity fortnite has received the past few months, more and more people are playing the game. Thus, bringing in more skilled players who are more than less dominating the top 20, top 10 and top 5.  When I get into the top 20 or better the chances of me running into a much more skilled player grow. I tend to see a lot of people with 2000 vbuck skins dominating this game, mostly due to their dedication to the game, playing every day for long periods of time. Obviously with more experience they play better than someone like me (which obviously makes sense). But this doesn't seem to make the game as fun as it could be, I’m speaking now for the casual player, (the ones that just hop on for a few games a day, couple hours a day sort of thing). It’s a little annoying when practically all your deaths are from a John Wick with a pump, or honestly just about any skinned player with a pump shotgun. Don't get me wrong, I liked what epic did with the color tier system for the shotguns.

      I was always thinking that, if possible, there would be a way to regulate player skills or player stats to match with players similar to yours. Instead of playing against somebody with hundreds of wins, maybe balance it out with someone who has around the same amount?

      If that makes sense. I just want to pick this subreddits brain regarding this, no hate towards people who are always winning or anything, or people who buy skins or only use the pump shotgun. I just think there’s an opportunity here to help the casual guys, maybe help make the game more balanced and enjoyable so that way the people who never or rarely get the chance to get in the top 25 or something don’t get too discouraged, like I have many a time. Thanks!

Here’s my take on it. 
Remember when everyone was making the concept map locations like a month or so ago? One user had the idea for *Crispy Crater* to replace tilted towers. He said something along the lines of... *”let’s nuke tilted and make it a new location”*
It wasn’t long after that post gained popularity that players started to notice the comet. 
Somewhere down the line, someone drew a connection to the player created location and the comet, claiming it’s going to actually happen. 
**nobody from epic even remotely confirmed any part of this allegation**
It was mere days before the rumor took over (largely due to shitty YouTube channels who steal all their content from the ideas created here). They have made plenty of unsuspecting players believe fan made concepts were real. (New guns, skins, etc.)
Then came the vibration glitch...
**Epic admitted this was a glitch and would be fixed. **
Yet someone made the rumor even bigger by claiming it was Morse code or something and once again, instagram pages and YouTube channels made thousands believe this was real. 
*it was all bullshit*
Today was suppose to be the day it happened. 
Nobody seemed to take into consideration they couldn’t destroy tilted because the battle pass challenges there. 
Well nothing happened today, and yet some of you still believe it’s gonna happen later this month just as much as you believed it was happening today. 
Tell me why they would get rid of the most popular location on the game? They probably wouldn’t. 

*So if it’s all rumors gone too far, what is the comet?*

Ever just consider it’s a little easter egg they added just for visuals? It’s a space themed battle pass. It’s not surprising at all that they added a comet to the sky. And I wouldn’t be surprised at all if it did absolutely nothing. 

I feel like if anything at all, it may be the introduction to a new map. Or new location. The top right side of the map is still very bare. It’s got the least named locations out of the rest of the map. Maybe they’re going to add a location there. But still why? The game is fine as is. Why fix the map when the maps not broken? 

Anyone else agree with me on this? 

Anyone else have any other theory? 

I’d really like to have an in depth *civil* discussion. ",FortNiteBR

These permanent challenges would span every season/battle pass and offer even more fun and difficult things for hardcore and casual players to work towards, without the stress of a weekly/daily time constraint. There could be separate challenges for squads, duos and solos, as well as some general ones.


Below is a list of a few challenges that I've thought of which could be a really fun addition the game! Feel free to add more creative suggestions below and hope that Epic might see this and get some inspiration!

Basically what im saying is tilted defines where the best goes, where you want the action, the loot, where I landed 24/7 to get better (probably many others did too) personally I stopped playing the game before the 1st season ended (ive been playing since launch) and the only reason I cam back and spent money is I had fun with tilted towers. Just let the meteor hit salty springs or something that sucks. 


I was wondering what the subreddit thinks of tilted getting removed. Am I the minority or are some of you guys with me on how much tilted towers has an impact on the fun of the game.",FortNiteBR

I have been killed in far too many tilted runs/top 10 situations by spike traps that were placed by somebody who was already eliminated. This is a game of skill and you should not be able to be killed by somebody that is already dead and maybe even already in a whole separate game lobby. If you are unable to win the game because you died, you should not be able to take away the opportunity of another player to win without even shooting a gun.

Please epic, this shouldn't be a hard tweak to make, and would make for an overall much more fair gaming experience.",FortNiteBR

I wouldn't mind 5 minute queues if it meant I lasted longer than top 50, to be 100% honest.  Either Epic acknowledges that there is an element of skill in playing and adds skill based matchmaking, or they don't, and we can let people like me who can build ramps and shoot at stationary targets be matched with people who can build like absolute gods and never miss a shot.  If it's the latter I can't be bothered to play.  ",FortNiteBR

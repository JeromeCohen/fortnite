and no, my aim isn‚Äôt bad, the gun just sucks. There are maybe 2 guns that you have a fair chance against if you have a tac, which is a SHOTGUN.

You can find that** [***right here***](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ankeww/an_ingame_setting_to_download_and_use_legacy/)**. I also posted this on the Epic Games suggestion page** [***here***](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/suggestions-advice/1058496-a-downloadable-option-to-use-old-textures-and-sounds-or-even-something-bigger)**.**  


***So, let's get into it.***  


I'm now aware that some people have saved their Season 1, 2, and 3 files, which means that if they sent them to Epic, they would have access to the files for things such as the old map, the old textures, color palette, backgrounds, music, sounds, and so on. My suggestion would be giving us the option to use those. This could be an option in the launcher to let us download legacy textures and sounds. Then you could flip a switch in the settings in-game to use them. There could also possibly be an option in-game to choose what lobby background we use. These are all things that people have been asking to have for, well, a very long time. As for me, I'm a really nostalgic person- the small things like that mean the world to me, and they always have. I wish I had decided to play more back in the day (Seasons 1-2), but I had a lot going on and just didn't play games much because of it. I've actually cried a few times because of it, not gonna lie.  
 

Another suggestion is a bit more extreme, but if Epic is willing to take the length to make players happy, this is another suggestion: Add some bug-fixed old Fortnite Season files as a downloadable option in the launcher, such as the Save The World files.   


Make this a limited time testing phase mode, but not in the BR lobby- something in the area where you choose between STW, BR, and Creative. You could name it ""blast to the past"", ""back to the past"", ""blast from the past"", or something along those lines.   


Give it a testing phase for a week or two, put up a few servers as you would with an LTM. See how the players like it. If it receives positive reviews, they could end the testing phase, fix the bugs they've found, and start it up again for longer periods of times. Epic could even rotate between seasons 1-3, if they wanted.   


People DO have the files, so even if they deleted them at Epic HQ, they could look around or I could link you all to some people that have them (which I will do). This would also serve as a way to get rid of some of the complaints about sweats ruining Fortnite. With the way the game was back then, and how things worked back then, it was far harder to sweat it out than it is now. Players that want to play competitive, can play in new Fortnite, while people who just want to meme and have fun can play the old Fortnite and experience some emotional, nostalgic memories.  
 

I would love to hear your feedback and opinions on these suggestions. I would also love to expand upon this idea with other players. I feel like this would bring back a whole heck of a lot of the players that left the game, and make the game a more enjoyable place.

The Series is called Fortnite: Uprising.

Plot: The Ice King, (Gustov Icewind) and The Prisoner, (Ashphobias Icewind) are at war, fighting to destroy the other, take over the island and rule the world, destroying the island piece by piece. Carbide, Omega and Raven form a Resistance group called ""The Reapers"" (Chosen by Raven obviously), to fight back against the Ice Legion and Fire Legion, while recruiting other characters along the way. They will be joined by the likes of Red Knight, Ravage, Steelsight, Commando and more, to try to restore the island back to what it once was.

**Greetings,**

i was suffering from FPS issues and it was highly related to the amount of grass and foliage. There might be gamers who probably know how to deal with the trouble. But, at the cost of horrible visual quality, you will be able to smmothen your game by doing this -  saying this to gamers with terrible desktops or notebooks.

&amp;#x200B;

 The only thing you could do (aside from adjusting the graphics across the game settings in the game) is configuring the **GameUserSettings** file located at appdata/local/FortniteGame/Saved/Config/WindowsClient directory.

&amp;#x200B;

 i will copy and paste the entire content of the file however, there are only two options you are supposed to alter concerning the grass and foliage as far as i discovered.

&amp;#x200B;

 *Those settings are* ; **bShowGrass=False (its True by default) ,  sg.FoliageQuality=0(its 3 by default)**

&amp;#x200B;

 **Additionally, you can change your Display Reso and  3D Reso through this file as well.**

-When placed, press your Use Key to look through it.

-Can be used to see from a very far distance.

-You can zoom in and out using the same controls as you use on the map (to zoom in &amp; out).

-It turns directions like the Cannon vehicle.

Another idea for a similar item would be Binoculars, which take up one space but have unlimited uses. You would right click to use it. It would come in Rare &amp; Epic Variants, with a Legendary variant that has Thermal Vision (like the Thermal Scoped AR).

Hi. This is my first post here, since i just started playing fortnite. The last 3-4 weeks, somebody has been loggin in on my account, throwing me out games randomly. (one time i was in the top 3 when this happened, and i almost broke my controller)

ANYWAYS, i thought i would be a good idea to enable this two-factor-authentication, i've been reading about in the loading screens.

I go to [epicgame](https://epicgames.com/)s

I try to log in. (incorrect credentials)

I try to reset my password (Email sent!)

I go to my email and nothing is there, nothing in spam, nothing in blocked adresses.

I visit some forums to see if anybody has the same problem (they have, and worse things)

Can somebody tell me if epic games have made any progress? this is serioulsy infuriating and i simply dont understand why a problem, which seems really small and simple, can take so long to fix.

Please help.

on a side note; who the frog hacks a fortnite account when it's free to play? (i dont buy any tiers or anything, so i dont suppose its because of the cosmetics)",FortNiteBR

In no way im saying im good, but I think im decent and know my shit.

What I want to say is the people that complain the most, not the total newbies, but all these s3/4 ""casuals"" just dont put the work, but want to get the reward. You know why people are so much better in this game? No, not because its their part time job, not because they stay 10 hours in playground, the reason is different.

Smart practice. Guys, come on, how was it in s4? If you wanted to practise building and shooting you had to actually play the game, there was no playground, creative with tons of practise maps. You had to drop wailing and practise your ramp rushes. Now you can just hop to either creative or playground and train either your aim or building, or even both.

Its about a smart practise, not about playing much. I guarentee you if you play a decent aim/edit map on creative for 15-20 mins every session, drop on team rumble, pick up a shotgun, AR (no, not granade launcher or RPG), try to use only shotgun close range (building to cover), ar for mid/long range you will get better.

This game is not only about mechanical skills, a lot of this is game sense, positioning, decision making. So please, stop complaining because something is not served on the plate, just put the effort if you want to keep up with the ones that do, because you dont have do drop first, you dont have to fight everyone mid game, you can still win if you play passive until endgame. You find it boring and you want to be fighting? Then drop hot drops, simple as that.

I know a lot wont agree, will complain, but I really think people have it easy to catch up now, especially with these creative map codes, you can train all your mechanical skills, seriously.",FortNiteBR

Playing in PC ""Public Matches"" via KBnM is easy even if on controller but a lot of the competitive scene for console simply cant compete because of frame drop, game bugs and Red Hit markers. I play on an Xbox One X and my console still cant handle endgames with 20-50 people moving circle and for a scrim its not a big deal, but when playing in important Scallywag/ Blackbeard cups its frustrating to not be able to compete even with a high end console having frozen/ major frame droppage and building delay. Its almost as if you don't want console to be able to compete with PC. They're are so many underrated console people who will not get the attention needed because its harder to get their name out there when playing in cups against every platform and PC players don't have any frame drops or building delay. End Game can be atrocious when everyone else can play to there fullest and not have to worry about not being able to build or connect shots. I understand its extra work but to make a happier community we need to have things fixed.

Examples: Playing in the Blackbeard tournament today at 30 points and couldn't build moving circle and couldn't turn without the game playing like utter garbage and delayed. Cost me placement points 3 placement points/ 1 Elimination, which could have qualified me for finals, considering i ended at 33 and 36 was top 3000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ex2: Playing in Mayhem West Scrims and had a 40 man 4th circle and i couldnt build at all allowing me to take hits before second later an entire 1by1 and roof are build instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

Im not trying to call the game bad but console needs better optimization and better customization of the graphic, Fov in hopes to be as Equal to PC as possible. I know stretched is difficult to input but console needs it to compete at the highest level. Even big streamers such as FaZe Tfue and Ninja have switched to stretch to keep up.",FortNiteBR

It‚Äôs people with barely 1-3 kills a game that are using the snipers and it‚Äôs frankly their only way of getting eliminations.

He clicked no (He didn't read it or know what it wanted). After clicking no he says he lost all his game progress. The first thing he did was call me (I'm known in our family for being good with computers). I've told him not to buy any skins on this new no skin account because I'm determined to get his things back.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the problem. 

The epic account he had was connected to his dads google email, which has since been deleted. So a password recovery isn't possible. I've since made him his own email account to try and link his game that way but it's linked this new no skin level 1 account. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the kicker.

He's 9 years old and doesn't have a clue how to email let alone contact support. But Epic support will only deal with the original account holder. His parents have probably spent a couple hundred dollars on V-Bucks for him. He's really beside himself that he lost all his progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have the receipts for purchasing all the v-bucks on playstation. Can we use that to verify account ownership? I tried contacting support on his behalf and they wouldn't have a bar of it.

I‚Äôve played a lot of competitive games like R6S, CS and Overwatch, and in all of those games, I‚Äôve never once seen people hating on players just because they‚Äôre good.

Instead of hating on people who kill you by ‚Äòtriple ramp taj mahal builder xDD‚Äô, you should strive to be better than them, or just find a different game. You‚Äôll never get better by just complaining about people who are just better. Sure, if somebody is camping on a mountain pyramid-peeking in a pub match pretending that he has $10M on the line, they could be classified as a sweat. But that‚Äôs just their way of playing. Everyone has their own way of playing. If they kill you by their way, just try playing like them and you might be surprised. If you‚Äôre bad at building, just find someone to practise against.

Obviously it‚Äôs a joke (I hope) when people make posts about turrets that only kill sweats, but that‚Äôs a terrible mindset. There‚Äôs so many ways to improve your skill in the game, but if you cry about better players and don‚Äôt try to improve, you can‚Äôt blame the players, because it‚Äôs *your* own fault for not trying to improve. If you don‚Äôt *try* in a battle royale game, what else are you supposed to do?

There will always be players who are just more skilled than you, overall. 

TL;DR, not every good player is sweaty, and even if they are sweaty, that‚Äôs just their preferred way of playing. Try finding ways to counter it.",FortNiteBR

A good feature about it in Save The World is that you can't upgrade them until they are fully built, meaning that you couldn't upgrade structures when turtling. I think it would be useful for BR now that the game has evolved enough.

So i created my account like back in season 6 (might be season 5) and my brother created account back in season 3,

So the thing is

Me and my brother would play on the same computer, but then i got ps4, so i linked my psn account with my epic games account, everything went great.

So not so long ago my brother decided to give his account away to me cause he is not going to play fortnite anymore.

So me being STUPID, i unlinked my psn account from my epic games account and linked his account to my psn account, again it worked..

So the problem is

I can unlink my brother account and link my to play on my account, but that's too much work, 

I would like to see Fortnite PSN account merging, cause it's really annoying to unlink my account and link another, it takes me like 10 mintues ..

Since account merging is available only if you linked your account before september 2018, it sucks

&amp;#x200B;

If you didn't understand what i said, cause my grammar sucks ima explain this simplier:

Make Fortnite PSN account merging, that woudn't require merge account only if you linked your psn accounts before september 2018, why would that even be a thing?

I can't really take this anymore, epic games staff said they can't do anything about it, so maybe if this get a lot of up's they might add (hopefully)",FortNiteBR

No, it's not an assault rifle. No, you don't shoot it close range like a shotgun and no, it's not a sniper. It's a hybrid of an assault rifle and a sniper rifle that kills in 3 shots minimum. It's a great skill based weapon because it forces you to aim better and in the direction of where the enemy is headed (kinda like battlefield) not like an assault rifle where you just aim and spray, hoping bloom is on your side. If I'm bad at aiming, I take because it encourages me to be patient and not just spray like it's an AR or an SMG. If you don't know how to use it, then take it instead of a sniper and learn how to master the gun at mid-range only. No more than that. It's the player, not the gun.

Spectating my teammates for the whole match made me bored and felt like want to play again ASAP.

The idea of granting 50 HP/Shield after the whole team is eliminated is to keep players from finishing off downed players mid-fight, so they have a chance to be revived.

Or, add a knockdown shield mechanism just like in Apex.

Or, add the respawn vans into the game to compensate this.

The change in mats harvesting and gaining 50+ health and shield for kills makes already good players nearly unstoppable now.  

This rule set can be really rewarding, but it also makes the skill gap between the better players and the worse players absolutely huge. At the very least give us some kind of means of matching us with players that are closer to our own skill level.

Long story short, my account got compromised and hacked into so I disabled it, then I asked EPIC if I could change the email and password, then re enable the account.... No response, a send a second email, I got another response instantly but it says ‚Äúsorry, it looks like someone else is already helping you with this problem.... blah blah‚Äù. Really? Are you kidding me? Whatever, I wait.

Next day comes, no response. This is a pattern that keeps happening over and over and over again until finally! Yes! The response I get is ‚Äúwe would love to help you, please provide the following info so we can make changes...‚Äù so I send the info, few hours later ‚Äúsorry, we cannot prove that you own the account, therefore we cannot make any changes‚Äù 

What. The. Fuck. I can disable my account with the snap of my fingers by just providing an email and some other stuff, but when I give about 5 times the amount of info THEY CANT VERIFY ITS MINE AND REFUSE TO DO ANYTHING!?

I just want to get back to playing Fortnite, is that so hard to ask?

TL;DR: Epic is refusing to enable my account after I have them detailed info to prove the account is mine, even after they let me disable the account to begin with.",FortNiteBR

LAST ONE STANDING. Go do your Conga somewhere else.

This sub doesn't help either since its just spreading the hate towards people that actually play the game even more (just look at the new section, its filled with fishsticks hating on people who are actually good and wish to improve.) I really think the mods should start deleting the ""SWEATS ARE RUINING THE GAME"" posts because its useless hate towards innocent people that just play the goddamn game. We are all here for a reason and that is to enjoy ourselfs in a game as gamers should do.

I have 15 years of high level gaming experience since original counter strike, more then that if I consider sonic on Sega mega drive, most of you where not born, so I would just like to give my opinion as most of these kids or new gamers are not even aware of SBMM ( skilled based match making ) 

To go a little more in debt on this I am sure that there must be some form of SBMM ( skill based match making ) or some lighter version of SBMM with a percentage of players in match with in a lobby . This is a business and they need to attract new players and retain current players . As the game stands it‚Äôs barely possible for a new player to jump on.
  
Can you imagine what it must feel like being a new player and jumping on today ? So I get that there has to be some SBMM remember this is not a ‚Äúpoint and shoot game‚Äù. - so I have to agree that some form of this has to be in the game, but there are ways and ways of doing this or going around it. If SBMM is actually a thing, this would be such a shame as looks what happened to COD and HALO once they went that route. Competitive should be rightfully so SBMM for the sweats and leave pubs open for all player pool and then have LTE‚Äôs for players that would like a more casual expierence. 

If you really want to bring new players on, then you can set up something like a previous gaming company had done where your first 15 -25 matches matches would be matched up with people that are also playing there first 15 matches or similar XP for instance, that way you don‚Äôt get literally raped by some female soccer skin ( that for the most part is a sweaty male fat kid eating Doritos and downing G-Fuel)  and as a new player and can still enjoy and learn the game.

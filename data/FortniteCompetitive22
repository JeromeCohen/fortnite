I did what the post said, and it helped me immensely.

Xbox allows you to both turn down your resolution to 720p and play on stretched res. This can be done through the display settings. I used these settings the entire week and mostly played the solo gauntlet, and I reached 141 points which I was really happy with. The new settings really helped with stacked endgames and allowed me to compete without being on a PC.

I wanted to post this to help Xbox players who didn’t see the original post. I forget the guy’s username or else I would link it in order to give some credit. Hopefully, we will be given specific settings within fortnite to help improve performance, but for now this is the best we can do. Definitely at least give these settings a try to see if it helps you too.",FortniteCompetitive

Most of my losses come from players that are leagues better than me (i.e. 8KD with 18 kills that round) and there's just nothing I can do to fight back at my skill level.

&amp;nbsp;

The basic strategy is to drop on a baller and never take any fights until the final 1v1. The mobility on the baller is insane to the point that I've only had my ball destroyed early in maybe 5% of my matches. Even if your ball gets destroyed, there are so many balls throughout the map that it's easy to grab a new one. You should save this map for baller locations: https://i.imgur.com/AyrEcLT.jpg and this map for vending machine locations: https://i.imgur.com/83v0bND.jpg Since the free vending machine changes, I am able to fly around the map gathering purple/gold items with minimal effort.

&amp;nbsp;

Your basic looting strategy is to hang around the outskirts of the map looking for a pump shotgun and an assault rifle. Weapon quality isn't that important, since each upgrade is only a few points of damage. For the rest of the slots, I prefer stinks/explosives to third party the final player while he's weak and redeploy to survive sky-high building situations. I currently use one slot for a healing item, but I have been debating picking up another offensive item since I very rarely need healing with this strategy. You can farm max materials in the jungle very easily, there are plenty of metal outposts and brick temples which can be broken down very quickly. You can also scavenge a ton of corpse loot, since you'll be flying around the map with ease. Since you move around the map so quickly, it's easy to farm tons of ammo, launch pads, and high quality weapons. I find rifts and sniper rifles to be generally useless items since your goal is to only fight the final player in the small moving circles.

&amp;nbsp;

The baller is 100x as powerful once you realize the basics of controlling it. If you look up when you boost, you go MUCH faster horizontally. The grappler seems to have stronger pull if you look away from the direction that you're moving. For instance, if you boost left and then grapple right, you'll get WHIPPED to the right incredibly fast. You can use this alternating movement for evasive maneuvers. One of the mistakes I made in the beginning was to let go of my grapple too early, since far grapples seems to build up momentum slowly you'll often benefit from holding the grapple longer. You can continuously fly around an object by grappling past it, spinning 180 and latching on again. You can even grapple on the ground and keep flipping 180s for quick movement in the final circles.

&amp;nbsp;

Aside from movement, you'll also need to get used to hiding. One of the basic spots to hide is to hang off the coastline. One of the spots I use the most is hiding on top of a tree. You can roll up some insane inclines with the baller, so you can easily move around on tree tops. Using the ""looking up"" boost method, you can easily jump from tree to tree without giving yourself away with the grappler. One thing I've noticed is that people won't realize you're there if you don't use the grappler, as the baller seems to be almost silent if you're just rolling around. I'll often roll right behind somebody in the moving circles and they won't realize I'm there. Another absurd method that works way more often that it should is the Drax method of moving so incredibly slow that you're invisible to the naked eye. You can often sit completely in the open undisturbed as long as you're not messing with other players. It seems to me that the ideal play is to leave you alone or else they're just adding another enemy to the chaos of the moving circles.

&amp;nbsp;

I'd like to mention a few things to be cautious about. The baller is a large target, so people can spray you and break it in 1 second flat. This makes it very important to stay out of sight. I've found that the people that will target you the most tend to be other people in ballers. They'll follow you around, grapple onto you, and wait for any opportunity to jump out and roast you. One of the greatest strengths of landing on a baller is that you can avoid every early/mid game fight. When I find a spot to loot, I'll circle it to make sure I don't hear any footsteps or objects being broken by a pickaxe. When you're looting, try to keep the baller next to you at all times. Literally loot something, jump in, roll a few feet, jump out and loot, jump back in, etc. The instant you hear footsteps/gunshots, jump back in the baller and fly away.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

I currently play at 2,000 dpi, 0.08 game sens. It's working wonders for me but today I read that mice have a ""native"" dpi which is usually 400, and then to set the mouse to higher dpi it uses a multiplier which causes imperfections. I am currently using the wireless Gpro.

This mode was just regular duos, but the catch was that every weapon was green, with higher tier weapons only available from the treasure map. I might get hate for this but I thought fights in Going green were much more balanced than in the regular mode right now. Nobody had overpowered weapons, one pumping was rare, most guns were viable, and there weren't any splodes besides for clingers. Most weapons felt like they were viable to use, and everyone basically had the exact same loadout by the time the first circle closed. How do you guys feel about green-only or blue-only rarity in pop up cups? I would love to test it out and see exactly how much better/worse it is than the current mode.

First things first.

-I regularly review the bot to tryhard post for fundamentals.

-My k/d has gone from a terrible .49 to a slightly better 0.81 and climbing for season 8. (I know its not impressive but Im proud of my growth)

-I play on console, no plans to switch as of late since Im not good enough for pc.

-I dont go for wins, rather going for kills and trying to win fights. I now get about 5 kills a game. 

-I started really taking the game seriously in season 7 but played very casually before that. 

-I promise this isnt part of meme monday. Just humbly looking for help in the comp sub. 

So lately my strategy has been to warm up and practice techniques in team rumble and then playing solos to put them into practice. I have started nailing some edit plays and my movement and positioning has improved alot. When it comes to mechanics, I almost always build after shooting, try to take high ground or reposition for a better angle and I now consistently get headshots. I expect that I will get better at this pace since I also review my games and learn my mistakes. I guess where I feel stuck now is closing the gap faster between myself and really good players. Meaning I dont want to be constantly 10 steps behind while improving myself. If there is anyone willing to help in a more personal way Id greatly appreciate it as right now there is only so much I can do alone. My goal is honestly to play with real finesse and feel fluid maybe get a really high kill game here and there. I came from a fighting game background so I just really enjoy tough fights. I dont have any dreams of going pro but it would be cool to be recognized as a good player some day.

75,Ariandelle-,1552940372,b2nivg,21,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b2nivg/even_when_i_dont_play_for_23_seasons_im_good/,0,Even when I don’t play for 2-3 seasons I’m good,"I haven’t took the game serious in 3 seasons. Only played up to fable in season 6 because I love the skin. But I completely skipped the rest of 6 and 7 entirely and I’m not playing 8. I’m not the best player but I easily can if I try to be. 

I don’t really get impressed watching pros or known good players because I already know I can get there in little time if I actually cared about fortnite. The reason why is because naturally I’m good at anything I try and usually require little time. Back in season 5 when I started it only took one week to be better than the average player. Once u found out about builder pro I became a better builder than majority very fast. 

After that season I stopped playing fortnite like that. Come back and I still clap ppl. My building is absurdly rusty and bad now and despite that I can still kill good players. Not sure why but I’m always a god even when I’m a bot. 

Imagine if I actually learned how to play the game again. I never practice in this game anymore. I don’t know how to do 90s. I spite players in this game. I don’t even use turbo build. I let ppl take over my wall just to blast them in their face when they edit and opening. I was on some stairs and I just build a platform. My opponent replaced it. I just stood there ADS. As soon as he tried to edit and pop me he got popped. 

It must be real embarrassing when a player that don’t even know how to build good anymore kills a “sweat.” You can tell by the skin they use, how they build, how they edit. At the end of the day, I’m still me, and I’ll always compete regardless. I don’t need to practice. Nor do I like fortnite enough to do so. So mentally I already think I’m the best due to the sole fact that I can be good at anything in little time combined with the fact I haven’t played in seasons and I can still destroy folks with the inability to build well.

Every single game he and his teammate Nio were either costed by lag or severely affected. I know there were obviously others, but I have only seen their POV’s. 

We are less than a month away from the first qualifiers (April 13th) and there seems to be no solutions to the server lag in stacked end games. On top of that there’s still a ton of bugs that cause players to instantly die, fall off builds, you name it. 

There is a life changing amount of money of the line for these players and if nothing happens, there’s no denying that some players will not qualify due to some sort bug/lag. It’s bound to happen with the amount of people competing as we’ve seen before. 

With no word from Epic (unless I’ve missed it), can we assume it’s just going to be another shit show of “hopefully I get lucky with lag and bugs” in one of the biggest video game tournaments ever? I’m honestly at the point of “what the fuck are they gonna do?” Lol",FortniteCompetitive

Placing top 36% in gauntlet finals and top 200 in scallywag round 1 with a random duo I met on discord 20 minutes after the event had started. We didn’t do to well round 2 of scallywag due to some rough rng but that’s just part of the game I’ve learned. Finished with 16 points could have done better but I was happy with the placement since I’m a father of a 2 year old daughter and work an 8 hour job mon-fri. However IMO it doesn’t matter what input you choose to play on. Overall it comes down to game knowledge and experience as well as positioning. I encourage anyone reading this that plays on controller to go back and watch your games see what you could done differently how you could have rotated better and ask yourself if that fight was even worth taking. Keep grinding and getting experience my fellow controller players. Don’t let anyone pressure you into using a kbm because they think it’s better. At the end of the day you have to come up with your own opinion think like a wolf and don’t follow the sheep.

I wanted to share this anecdotal story to all controller players considering switching to kb&amp;m 

2.5 Weeks Ago, I finally had enough money put aside where I could get a pc while still being able to do things with friends and pay for gas, so I played kb&amp;m on Xbox for around a week. On controller I scored well in many pop up cups and had a 3-4kdr. In that time, I mostly played creative doing aim and edit courses trying to learn to basics. I played duos with some awesome pc players that helped me a lot, and occasionally hopping into solos to humble myself. In solos, the most kills I got was like 3 if I was lucky.

1.5 weeks ago my pc came in and holy crap the game felt so nice with 144 FPS at all times and no input lag with my kb&amp;m. I was still kind of a bot but grinded solos, duos and gauntlet. I reached top 1% in both solos and duos gauntlet, and with the help of a fellow player on this sub just missed day 2 of scallywag by 2 points.

Tonight I have played getaway, and dropped 15 bombs over and over again. Shotguns and edits feel godlike on kb&amp;m, and although I feel like overall I still am a tad better on controller, in a few more weeks I would absolutely shit on my controller self.


Personally, I couldn’t recommend making the switch enough to you controller grinders ;)",FortniteCompetitive

After Patch v7.40 the community has been less complaintive towards the game - since this patch fixed a lot of issues with the game (RPG's having too common - deagles being uncounterable etc). But now it seems like the big names are constantly complaining about their opponents - whether they kill or are killed by them. There is no respect.  


I get that players like Tfue have to deal with stream snipers and grieving all the time - but the blame game is getting out of hand... If you're in a top 200 player pop up game - that caliper of opponent is likely not devoting their game to grieving you. If you have an opponent shooting at you - its likely because they feel your position threatens their chances of winning. Not because they have your stream open on a second screen and are hardly able to contain the excitement of possibility killing you.

Either you have a baller or you have to box and hope you don’t get clingered by anyone because if anyone shoots at you you will get focused by everyone.

I did pretty well in the tournament (31 points) but every time I died it was because I got hit by 6 clingers 6 stinks and spammed at the same time and when you try to edit out there is another team that will laser you. All while there are 4 balls rolling around unbothered.

This is a problem, and I think it should be an easy fix.
The tournaments should have separate item pools to the normal pubs. In my opinion there should be no clingers and no stinks or stinks with reduced damage, ballers should be removed or reworked and maybe the chance to get certain weapons out of chests should be reworked.

This would make the cups more skill oriented and keep the pubs fun for

I really like Fortnite, I play it a lot, but I don’t really like the ranked modes. The only reason I didn’t really like the gauntlet cup that much was because no one wanted to get kills. Pushing almost anyone was a bad idea, because placement was what gave you the most reliable amount of points. When I play pubs, I almost always go hot drop or tilted, because I like exciting games and getting kills. What I don’t like is spending ~20 minutes of my solo farming and rotating and getting MAYBE 1 kill. To me, that’s just boring. You are sitting and doing pretty much nothing. That is, unless you enjoy mining trees. (yes, I know there’s more to it than just hitting trees and stuff, but the point is, you aren’t fighting a lot of people).

I’m not saying kills aren’t/weren’t important in the gauntlet, they just usually weren’t worth it because of the risk involved. Crowded endgames are fun, but getting there is not. In my “perfect” game mode/ranked mode, kills are equally important, if not more than placement, so people want kills as much as they do high placement. 

I’d like to hear opinions in the comments, because maybe you could change my mind. I’m totally open to hearing other ideas and thoughts on this matter.",FortniteCompetitive

I see no reason why this option shouldn’t be aloud on there, as console/mobile arguably struggles the most with FPS drop and overall quality. Also, I feel we are at a huge disadvantage in competive or pop up cup style games vs PC players. Most of these are simply due to the computing power of modern gaming PCs when compared to consoles, but when the opposing PC player can see you before you see them simply because of their resolution, that is not fair.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1hYy51GUc8&amp;feature=youtu.be

My partner knocked a player down and hit him for over 300 damage while he was knocked down, with no kill. We never got the point. Also, after the match was over, one of our points was taken from us. We would have advanced to the finals if we had one of either of these points. All we want is to play the finals.

I said they're not OP, and a lot of people here definitely disagreed with it. I still believe they're not OP, but I have had some new thoughts I definitely want to share.

Today I had a good 4-5 hr session for completing my getaway challenges, practicing in playground, with frineds, and then playing some solo gauntlet. In the gauntlet, after I got into the high teens and into the 20's, just full sending at tilted wasn't working as well, because lobbies were full of much better and smarter players then before, so I decided to test out what everyone has been saying. I landed further out, got a hamster ball, and waited till top 25 to start to play agro so I was guaranteed a net gain in points. (yes I know i'm a pussy. I just can't play enough to afford losing points cus I'm barely able to play on weekdays balancing school with baseball). So during that time, I learned why right now the hamster balls are a little OP, but won't be for long when people figure out how to play them. 

The problem is that because their so different to any other vehicle, nobody knows how to play them. In a gauntlet game that I won, I kept rotating and nobody even shot at me. Meanwhile, people say that a reason they're OP is bc they give you safe rotations endgame. But here's the thing. They are only temporary protection, If people would just shoot at the hamster balls. I honestly don't know why nobody just shoots them. In a few weeks, these things will be a lot less useful in the endgame. They only have 300 health, so any AR will mow them down in &lt;5 seconds. The second reason they are considered OP is because they allow someone to get easy placement points. As for this point, there's no denying it. You can grapple yourself up to some tall-ass mountain and just wait there. By the time it takes for someone to build up for you, you'll be long gone. In my eyes though, I don't see it as that bad because it's pretty balanced. While you can guarantee yourself those placement points, your allowing plenty others to get those elimination points. Ovr, I definitely see that the hamster balls will become a regular and overall accepted part of competitive play. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.",FortniteCompetitive

I've already had this opinion since Season 3 (Played on Ps4 back then). It happend when Playground came out, me and my Friends were doing 2v2, and we had that Friend that always Spammed L2, and trust me, i raged hard, because no matter what i did, after i died the first time, i couldn't even Land and i already died because he could Laser me only by spamming L2, and trust me, he was the biggest noob on Earth. Back then i could understand that Controller Player would need Aim Assist because of the Disatvantage to the Pc Players, but lets be honest, since Season 8, there is like 0 advantage the Pc Players have compared to Controller, only Editing Back pretty fast with the Scroll Wheel. 

What i wanna say, is that in Order to do Damage, you need the Aim, and dude, ffs, you can't tell me that someone without any Skill should be able to Laser people out of the Sky just by spamming L2. In order to Laser someone that hard i had to spend Hours and Hours in training my Aim on Pc, which now brings me to the Point, is the Pc now in Disadvantage to Controller? I mean it shouldn't be possible for a Noob that doesn't even know what a 90 is lasering People out of the Sky without even having to Aim properly? Am i wrong? I mean Issa, Kamo and all these Players proved that you can aim without Aimassist (And no, it isn't because they're really good, i have a lot of friends with a good aim on controller without having to abuse L2 spamming, and trust me, they ain't near as good as Kamo and Issa) 
I mean as example, look at Aydan, he would't be able to hit 1 Single shot if there wasn't Aim assist. There are so many People investing Hours in practicing their Aim and their Aim isn't even near as good as the Aim someone has on Console without having to spend like 1 min.

And remember Guys, i was a Controller Player to back in the Days, and we fought for Equality, that no one has a disadvantage, but seeing Noobs laser people out of the Sky without having to practice nothing compared to a Pc Player spending hours in practicing his Aim and still not beeing able to Laser people that way isn't near as Equal.

All in all, Aim Assist needs a nerf, First of al the Range in which it's Working, and the 2nd is to make the duration of the Time Window until it Locks on back to the enemy longer so L2 Spamming won't be possible.

For every Console Player that wants to say ""But we have this and that disadvantage"" write it in the comments, i'm sure i'll find a response to show you that there isn't no disadvantage anymore!",FortniteCompetitive

Whether you agree or disagree it's all good.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't quite know what is going on exactly (and I didn't post earlier because I thought it was just me, but I am now sure it isn't) but building in season 8 has got a lot harder.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all structures are not keeping people out since the update.  For some reason whenever I place a ramp, floor or cone in front of someone they always phase through.  I have opponents run towards me spraying their smg and I build a ramp they pass straight through and keep going (I mean they just phase through).

&amp;#x200B;

Second smgs are hitting me because for some reason the builds don't place fast enough (players on top of my 1x1 also somehow drop in even though I am holding the build button (maybe this relates to high ping I don't know).  Also I've noticed  a huge delay in building at times.  For example when trying to do 90s the floor sometimes won't place for a second or so.  I think somehow building speed has been decreased.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is that people are shooting me even though I get a build down first. So for example if someone shoots a pump and I place a wall down, it hits me anyway (even though it shouldn't).  I've also had some problems where builds don't go in the right place.  I know where to look to build a wall, it has been 4 seasons but since the new season they sometimes go elsewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some nasty camera angles that have appeared since the update as well.I mean you can't see a thing.  For example when hard up agains a floor, all I can see is the material it's build from.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally I'm also experiencing huge frame rate losses and that ""visual bug"" with the ping when doing building battles (20 fps is good during a build battle now, it averages 5 to 15).  My average ping goes up to 600 (yes today) during larger build battles and I can't switch anything in invantory, I try and box up and wait for it to go back down.  Editing also seems to cause a slight lag (the fps is already low, so that maybe why).

WOW. I have a small amount of experience so I’m no expert, but on the first day of gauntlet I played solos for 2 hours and got 43 points. queue times started reaching (15+ mins because old queue system) so I just left it, luckily this was top 1% even till the end.

Since I never had a duo partner before I grabbed someone off the Atlantis Scrims discord who was alright (2-3KD player) and could make some plays but may not always pull their weight. When playing this Scallywag cup it brought a new appreciation to pros and how pro they actually are. I usually pubstomp and to see pros do it I thought the gap was literally minor, but this cup has made it apparent that this is not the case. When you watch pro duos play on stream everything looks easy and natural, it isn’t. The communication and chemistry between duos are super important and also the fact that you both understand each other’s play styles are the little things that show on stream. When I was playing solos I thought duos can’t be that much different but the skill gap is raised so much higher with duos I feel like it’s actually crazy, I didn’t qualify for top 1500 as we only got 35 points, but this experience has been very informative and educational and wish the best to everyone participating. Any tips on practicing and finding the right partner? I think I may have underperformed due to lack of chemistry, lack of comms etc. that a new duo would have. ",FortniteCompetitive

It also confuses the opponents in general even if neither of you got lasered, as it makes it harder for enemies to make callouts on who to push and who is where.

I started playing Fortnite in S3 on XB1. I’m a natural born competitor and want to be the best at everything I do. 2wks ago I bought a gaming PC because that’s where most of the best players are and if you ever want to maximize your performance, playing on PC is how that’s done. I’m a below average player or what most of the community would call a “bot”. I have a total of 12 wins in Fortnite (9 wins being from Solo). Since making the switch from console to PC, there’s been a lot of good to come from it and I can tell I’m improving, but I still have trouble in build fights**. Is there a creative map designed for build battles? For example me battling against the dummies/robots while I try to take high ground and they’re trying to shoot it down?** None of my friends play Fortnite so the only time I get to practice against somebody building against me is in Solos. I come to the realization that I’ll never be “pro” level, but I just want to win some solos ‘here &amp; there’ without playing passive (Playing that way is boring to me) With the 50 shield &amp; 150 mats update 6wks ago, I think it’s going to be a very long time until I see a solo win if I keep struggling to win build fights.

After some research Im finally gonna make the jump from 60 to 144hz. I’ve done research on Monitors and determined that the viewsonic xg4202 is considered the “best” however it’s above 200 in the UK.

&amp;#x200B;

I play in Asia server, and Gauntlet Solo here is dead due to lack of population. It is simply impossible to gather 100 people all the time while maintaining skill-based matchmaking. Creatives and replays while queuing would be nice but they don't help if there are literally no games to find. Rather, **we need a game system that works with a limited number of players**.

The problem here is that the current matchmaking tries to achieve 3 things at the same time: **24/7, skill-based matchmaking, and gathering full 100 people**. Obviously it fails, so **we have to make a compromise**.

* First, being able to play ranked matches 24/7 is absolutely good. Some people were unable to participate in some pop-up cups because of time constraints, and I am not an exception. Limited time ranked is not for all of us. **We need 24/7 to make everyone happy**.
* Secondly, SBMM is one of the core concepts of ranked mode. Fighting against the same skilled players is tough but fun and mentally rewarding even if you lose. It is very different from stomping or being stomped. Maybe ranking system without SBMM still works, but that's not much different from pubs. I don't know if top-tier players enjoy it or not but mid-low tier players will be heavily discouraged from playing the game as seen in current solos. **SBMM is needed for everyone to have fun**.
* Lastly, **the number 100 is actually just a custom** and not something thought or calculated out with reasoning. I think there is room for improvement. It is okay to reduce the number. A battle royale with 50 players is still a battle royale, and it is even with 20 or 10 players. Everyone can enjoy it and no one is to be sacrificed, as opposed to limited time ranked or non-SBMM. I think this is the way to go.

If we manage to implement it, **queue time issue will be solved** at the same time. I strongly believe that queuing shouldn't be longer than 5-8 minutes because in BR games you could die right after you land and it is probable that you wait for 20 minutes and the actual gameplay is 20 seconds long. This is very different from other games such as CSGO or OW, where 30-60 minutes gameplay is guaranteed. Another good effect is about server issues. A fewer number of players mean **less strain on the server**, resulting in a more comfortable competitive experience.

I am going to explore the possibilities of the system in the following sections. Suggestions and opinions are welcome. (It might be okay to hold final matches on a specific time period to realize lobbies with 100 people by giving up 24/7. It a trade-off.)

**1. Adjusting placement points according to the number of the players in a match**

The current point system is built based on the assumption that every lobby is filled with 100 people so it needs adjustment a bit.

The scheme is the following (*n* represents the number of the players in the lobby) :

118+n-1-2n

* The number 118 is the total points gained by placement. (10\*1+7\*4+5\*10+3\*10=118)
* ""n-1"" is the total points gained by kill.
* ""-2n"" is the bus fare.

In a lobby with 100 people, the point system works. (I guess the number 17 is there for points lost by logging out, self-elimination, and storm death. By the way I think this number should be lowered a bit with the 15 seconds kill grant system implemented but this is not the main topic here.)

118+99-200=17

In a lobby with 90 people, it starts to be distorted. Ten more points are distributed through 1 match.

118+89-180=27

In a lobby with 50 people, it is completely broken, 50 more points dealt.

118+49-100=67

The reason is that placement points are not affected by the number of the players while kill points and bus fares are. We need to fix it by varying placement points according to the number of the players. Note that the ratio of placement points to kill points is distorted as well. It is roughly 1:1 with 100people, and 2:1 with 50 people. **The goal is to prevent point inflation and to keep the ratio of placement points to kill points 1:1**.

As for kill points, it should be maintained as long as SBMM works. You fight against the same skilled players so each kill should be rewarding.

**1.1 Placement points for Top x %**

Instead of granting placement points for top 1, 5, 15, 25 players, granting them for top 1, 5, 15, 25 % works better with fewer players.

With 100 players, points are the same as the above.

With 90 players, top 1, 4, 14, 22 players receive them. The total placement points are 105. (10\*1+7\*3+5\*10+3\*8=105) (I cut off the decimals but it could work if I include them.) And the total point change by a match is 14. It is lower than 17 but I think this is okay because fewer points are lost by self-elimination and others.

105+89-180=14

With 50 players, top1, 2, 7, 12 receive them, and the total placement points are 57. (10\*1+7\*1+5\*5+3\*5=57). The total point change is 6, and this is also okay because the possibility of self-elimination and others is halved.

57+49-100=6

Even with 20 players, it could work. Top 1, 2, 3, 5 players receive them. The total placement points are 28 (10\*1+7\*1+5\*1+3\*2=28). The total change is 7. (The number 7 could be too large but this is an extreme case.)

28+19-40=7

So this placement point system is likely to go well. **It doesn't promote point inflation, and succeed in keeping the ratio of placement to kill roughly 1:1 so the gameplay will be consistent**, not affected by the number of the players. You can still profit 1 point (3 placement points for top 25%, and -2 bus fare) without killing. (Whether it is good or bad is not the concern here, but the consistency is.)

One drawback is that it is **less intuitive about when you can get placement points but this problem can be solved with a ""Top x %"" HUD** beside the placement HUD and probably with a table of placement and points beside the map on the large map screen.

**1.2 Decimal multiplier**

Another option is to have a decimal multiplier for placement points based on the number of the players in a lobby. If there are 90 people, placement points are multiplied by 0.9, and if 50people then multiplied by 0.5.

With 90 people, the total placement points are 118\*0.9=106.2, and the total change is 15.2. Each placement point is 9 points for the winner, 6.3 for 2-5th, 4.5 for 6-15th, and 2.7 for 16-25th.

106.2+89-180=15.2

With 50 people, the total placement points are 118\*0.5=59, and the total change is 8, with 5 points for the winner, 3.5 for 2-5th, 2.5 for 6-15th, and 1.5 for 16-25th.

59+49-100=8

This system seems to work as well to prevent point inflation and to keep the placement-kill ratio. **You can easily know when you get points, but it is less intuitive about when you can make a profit**. (I don't know which point system is better so opinions are welcome.)

**2. Early game tweaking**

This is optional. The early game with fewer players is drastically different from the early game of 100 people in terms of early game fights, loot, farming, and rotations. Without tweaks it will be all about end game but that's not bad and a matter of taste so this is not necessary. But in real prize tournaments the early game is crowded and very hard (I guess), so it might be **good practice** as long as early game RNG is addressed properly. And it could be **boring and lengthy with much fewer players like 50 or 20**, so I think it is worth consideration. **The aim is to replicate the early game of lobbies with 100 people.**

**2.1 Flexible storm system**

One way is to change the storm according to the number of the player. It limits areas in advance, and the storm shrink size and time are also scaled down.

With 90 people, 90% of the whole map is available at the start of the match, and with 50 people, 50% of the map, and so on. The map of Fortnite is composed of 100 squares (10\*10) so 50% is roughly 7\*7 squares so seems appropriate. Even with 20 people it appears good since 20% is between 4\*4 and 5\*5 squares. It offers a fair amount of loot and mats for the number of players.

By doing so, **we don't need new maps** and we can keep practicing. A drawback is that **you might have to land on a different place every time.**",FortniteCompetitive

Hopefully this will benefit console players who want to play competitively, but are hindered by their hardware and cannot afford to switch to PC.

I am such a player and use these techniques myself and have undoubtedly experienced an improvement from before, with respect to general game performance, especially in late game, and have certainly felt ‘better’ at the game and that the gap between PC is narrower than before. So, what do you have to do?

1. Disable game captures and replays 

I recommend that you switch off game captures and in game replay recording, as these features contribute to a lower FPS. Whilst you will lose the ability to make game captures and watch replays, your game will definitely run better. The difference is not huge, but any advantage you can get is worth it.

2. Stretched or lowered resolution 

As I’m sure many of you know, you can indeed play stretched res on console. However, you can only play 640 x 480 with black bars, which looks like ass at first. I myself use this resolution, though, and within the first few hours of playing got used to how it looks ( I found lowering the sharpness setting on your monitor makes it more bearable), and actually now find it more enjoyable than the standard resolution, as the game feels smoother and FOV is increased. Stretched res has by far been the biggest factor in improving game performance and late game feels much, much better and I saw better results that when I was on native. If console stretched is too much of an eyesore for you, then you should certainly at least lower your resolution. The latest generation consoles all support 4K, and you may be playing at this resolution. While it may look nice, it is not doing you any favours and is one of the main causes of poor performance. I recommend lowering your display resolution to 1080p or even 720p (you can do this in your console’s settings) as this will help get better frames.

3. Video and picture settings 

In game, you want to make sure you have motion blur turned off as it will improve how your game runs because it no longer has to render this blur effect. I also recommend switching the your monitor to the ‘game mode’ picture setting because this is optimised for gaming and therefore leads to very slightly better game performance.

Using these tips, I guarantee that your game will feel a lot better and that you will experience better frames, especially in late game. Although it is by no means a perfect solution as PC will always be better, I hope that this will at least allow you to play at closer to your full potential whilst still being on console.",FortniteCompetitive

Guess not. So, in order to help me get better at the game I plan on building a better PC this summer. 
On the other hand: If you're a ""bot"" lurker reading this and I just completely bummed you out because you have a POS laptop too, don't be too bummed.

Although the mechanic is very useful, and some may even say necessary to counter turtling, stink grenades are not balanced in its current state.

The main issue with stink grenades is that they are ""uncounterable damage"". An example of uncounterable damage was when for a short period of time explosion damage could go through builds. No matter what you do, you still are going to take damage. Even if each individual stink grenade doesn't do much damage on their own, it quickly piles up especially since it only affects raw health. 

If we take a look at other ""anti-turtle"" utility items (such as Clingers and Dynamite), all give the user initial warning to counter (beeping of clingers, fuse of dynamite). Stink grenades have no sound warning, immediately ticking damage on the target with building having no effect. Even when creating multiple boxes, trying to escape/trick enemies, the area of denial is huge when enemy teams are throwing max stack stinks.

Stink grenades can easily be fixed by either reducing the availability of stinks and upping their rarity, or simply reducing the amount of stinks that can be carried (similar to what was done with clingers). Even adding a sound before an enemy throws a stink could help.

Part of my reason for posting it here in the first place is that someone may be more willing to test this further as I cannot record and compare to before.

So far I myself noticed this on my Nintendo Switch as well as my friend on PS4 who I talked to about it yesterday and some people in a thread I made about it on FortniteBR. 

It may be most noticeable for me since Switch barely had any aim assist before compared to the other platforms. 

Before I would have to carefully tap fire to get some shots in on middle distance(let's say around 30-50m) to make the most of your FSA. Now, especially with the standard AR and silenced SMG you locate your target, press fire... And then just continue to press it because you are melting them. Likewise everyone I come across now with said weapons kills me off in one second, people that should not have that kind of aim and did not have before.

**2 things I can imagine may have happened**

* They buffed Aim assist

* They significantly reduced bloom on some weapon types(AR, SCAR, Silenced SCAR, p90, silenced SMG)

**What baffles me the most is that only a handful of people seem to have noticed or are even possibly affected by it**

My playstyle changed drastically, both close quarters and middle distance people with spray weapons will kill me instantly if I don't cover myself and I will do the same to them. 

This comes at a time where console performance is pretty shit in general(affecting aim) and they rearranged console lobbies so that may be why it went unnoticed? Switch players may think this is due to mobile auto fire and not notice that they can do the same now ect..

Should i stick to this res or are there better ones for more fps? Also, i lock my fps to 120 so they dont vary as much. Should i change the hz monitor from 144 to 120?

Although I consider myself a casual, I stopped playing fortnite because it became boring because I couldn’t find a challenge in pubs ( I don’t consider myself a pro, but better than a majority of the players, I’d clap most of you ttv sweats) However when I see the complaints on the sub about nerfing heavy sniper and hamster balls, it just goes to show that people don’t like to adapt and love to blame the game straight away. I’ve never seen a problem with the heavy sniper for the many months it has been in the game, and only recently people started complaining, even with the baller, people are complaining about new rotation methods, rather than adapting. So my point is how many of you “pros” can actually qualify for that title when all you do is complain. Again I am a casual but I am confident i will clap most of the sweats on this sub ",FortniteCompetitive

413,iTripnotic,1552646059,b1dakc,27,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b1dakc/console_to_pc_progression/,22,Console to PC Progression,"**Disclaimer:**

*When I say “PC"" I mean I’ve full commitment to the whole mouse and keyboard grind on PC.*

&amp;#x200B;

\- I made the switch from Xbox to PC exactly 3 weeks ago. I would consider myself an above average controller player. By no means was I dropping high kill games every game but i was still maintaining around 10 - 15 kills a majority my games, and even when I wasn’t dropping high kills, I could definitely out build and maneuver most of the people I ran into on console.

**Making the Switch**

**Week 1:** This was by far the hardest couple of days, and I mean it was terrible for me. At the time I had been going around copying binds and sensitivities of professional players. I eventuality found binds that I liked and they seemed to be comfortable. I started getting VERY annoyed on how hard it was to even move with **WASD** for me, I was running into walls, I couldn't properly do any sort of ramp rush without falling off or moving too much to one side. I had even given up at one point and plugged my controller into my PC for the rest of the day. I slept on it, woke up and continued back on the mouse and keyboard struggle the very next day. I tried my best to stick to the same binds after switching them almost every day it seemed like.

&amp;#x200B;

**Week 2:**  I slowing but surely was getting more comfortable with mouse and keyboard. I finally found a set of binds I was going to stick with no matter what, and make any of small changes I felt were necessary later down the road. At this point, I was mainly in Creative or any available LTM. I rarely did any regular game modes for the first week and a half. I made a few adjustments here and there, such as scroll wheel edit reset which is totally a game changer for anyone just starting out I HIGHLY recommend it. I eventuality started playing Solo's, and I would land Tilted every game, I would try being aggressive towards anyone, even if i wasn't confident going into that fight. Most of the time I would get completely embarrassed, I sometimes couldn't even get a shot off before they'd kill me. I tried looking past that. I knew I was getting experience which was good. I didn't care if I died, I just wanted to improve and that mindset has helped me progress. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Week 3:** This is where I am today, I've managed to stick with the same binds for a while now. I've gotten some Solo wins and couple high kill games which has been a big motivator, seeing where I started from. Even now, being a lot more used to my binds, I still often press the wrong key, or miss several shots in a row. I make stupid mistakes, I even panic build when I shouldn't. Anyway, I'm making noticeable progress which is a good sign, landing and actually being able to get a few kills before dying is a HUGE change to where I was a week ago, not even getting a kill for several games.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're making the switch or want to switch to PC. It takes TIME and LOTS of practice. You at some point will probably want to quit like I did. I promise you after the first week or two things will start to become more natural for you and you'll be happy you went through with it. I know I'm not alone making the switch and wanted to share my experience with you all.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm just trying to cop more complex techniques where I can trap my op without building to freaking heaven, because the only ""technique"" I can execute is placing a panel over my op and edit dropping down for a quick shotty elim. All I've really perfected to second nature is triple ramping as well as a lil mastery of editing to an extent that could be exceeded . that's nothing. But anyways.... techniques is something I can figure out online

The Real question: is my sens optimal for god level building and can I make it work if I hope on perfecting basic skills like 90s or complex build battle techniques?

454,TBEMystify,1552608244,b17vcs,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b17vcs/maintaining_the_competitive_integrity_of_fortnite/,7,Maintaining the Competitive Integrity of Fortnite,"***TL;DR***: With the state of the loot pools in Fortnite as well as the excessive amounts of movement, it ruins the integrity of competitive play, as seen with the Gauntlet events as of late. Epic needs to make some serious changes to movement, end zones, material counts, and the loot pool, as well as minor adjustments to certain weapons. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Material Count**

Lets begin: At this point in time right now, 1500 materials (150 builds) is not enough with the current ending zones. If you have been playing or watching the Gauntlet Duos and Solos, it is easily recognizable that 1500 mats is not enough for late game, especially with the current zones that exist. When placed in such close quarters with often over 15 other people, it is impossible to recover the mats from your kills when/if you get them, and you must be walling yourself off from every angle to avoid death. To expand upon this, when you are in end game you must be worried about who is above you, below you, to your left, right, front, and behind you. Just to cover these once in midground, you must use over 60 materials, not including if your walls/floors are broken by someone spamming an AR/SMG at you. At best case, you can have 1500 materials going in to these smaller zones. 1500 divided by 60 leaves you with 25 times you can go into a full ""turtle"". Yes, this may seem like a lot at first, but when you truly look deeper it is not. Often players will not have anywhere near 1500 materials as they wouldn't have just killed someone when zones 7, 8, or 9 commence and they have been turtling in 1x1's. Because of this, a good estimate of remaining mats is somewhere around 1000-1200, which leaves 20 turtles at maximum. Each moving zone alone requires you to move at least 7-10 floor squares across to reach the next, unless you are blessed with it near your side. Considering this, and the fact that there are 3 moving zones, plus the final circle, it is literally impossible to stay in full cover the whole time. Yes, this is a good thing, but it also means that most, if not all players will run out of mats in the closing zones. Unless they are lucky enough to loot someone, which requires the risk of being shot in the back when going for this loot, then they are stuck low on mats, open to enemy fire. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Material Count Fix**

I propose to Epic that every kill the player is directly awarded 150 materials, first prioritizing 50 of each, but then giving left over material in the form of another type. Ex: You have 130 wood, 350 brick, and 500 metal. Instead of giving the player 50 metal on the ground, it converts into the most similar type of rarity: brick. This players now has 180 wood, 450 brick, and 500 metal in their inventory immediately after the finish\*. (I will address this idea of finishing vs knocking giving shields and mats later as it also hinders competitive integrity.) Secondly, the mat cap should be increased to 2000 materials, **just for competitive modes** so that in ending zones, there are enough materials to effectively turtle and not be killed by solely 3rd party players who sit in a zone they got blessed with or on high ground. This could be divided up into 750, 650, 600 or many other ways, but it shouldn't be 1000 wood instead of 500 as that is too drastic of a change and increases wood demand too much. Wood is the most plentiful, so it should have a higher cap than brick, and brick is more prevalent than metal so it too should have a higher cap than metal. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Movement (Late Game)**

This point belongs directly after material count as it negates the use of materials and often players who use movement and have it readily available place much higher than those who are stuck on the ground. When watching any top player play any competitive mode, they want rifts, launch pads, quad crashers, or any type of movement for late game. Why is this? Well, it makes it so they don't have to waste materials - which there are not enough of - to move to the next zone. As well as this, movement such as a rift to go provides shielding from the enemies on the ground who cannot see you and rotating players often will not look up into the sky. For this reason, the rift to go must be vaulted. The rift to go is way too overpowered for late game. Often, players will choose to fly in the air as they have free rotations and do not have to waste mats. This messes with the integrity of the game, as it is meant for people to be fighting everyone, and you shouldn't be blessed by RNG and be able to float in the sky. This moves me to launchpads. The drop rate must be cut in half, if not more for the same reason as the rift to go. The ability to place one floor and a launch pad, and move what would normally take 350-600 materials is completely unfair. Not only does the flying aspect provide a barrier from fire, but it emphasizes the RNG that exists within the game. RNG should not determine who can rotate in a zone, it should be based around the smart plays someone makes in rotating early or just flat out being able to outbuild others. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Movement (Late Game) Solution**

Rift to Go's need to go. As stated above, they ruin the late game aspect and make rotations too easy for those who are lucky enough to get them. Launchpads need to be nerfed down to the rarity of a season 1/2 gold scar, so that they are the rarest item in the competitive games. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Movement (Early Game)** 

Early game, movement is key. Movement is not as big of an issue due to the conservation of it that occurs. This is seen through the planes that once existed as pro players would fly around, not shooting at one another, just so they could save there mats. Early game movement such as hamster balls, hoverboards, and quads do not need to be changed much, except they should disappear somewhere in the late game. These need to be readily available and you should not be able to shoot while on a hoverboard as it is unfair that someone can roll by and third party so easily, much like the planes. The only other offer I propose is that there is a much longer dismount time, so that players cannot easily third party fights by rolling up and immediately hopping off there ATK or Hamster Ball. Lastly, the geysers near volcano need to be heavily nerfed in height as they allow for players to easily third party fights by landing on fights anywhere near the top right corner of the map. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Movement (Early Game) Solution**

ATK's, hoverboards, and hamster balls must despawn at one of the later zones so they don't give free rotations. As well as this, the dismount time should change to 5-7.5 seconds to prevent third partying, unless the riders is shot at by an enemy. (Yes I understand this is hard to code, but it is definitely doable as they were able to implement other ideas such as storm surge) Geysers must be nerfed height wise, or must make you travel slower since they allow quick escape and easy third partying opportunities. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ending Zones and Solution**

As long as the material and movement issues go unaddressed, the ending zone need to be changed. For competitive, there are often 20+ people in a zone the size of old motel. The issue comes with the distance that all of these players must rotate. Yes, I understand Epic is trying to not allow for the turtling and campfire endgames that they found boring during the early tournaments. But it still needs to be fixed. Having to rotate over twice the diameter of the current storm, plus more at times is ridiculous. End zones should be no further than 1-1.25 diameters of the previous zone apart. This would allow for every player to not waste too many mats while also making them get out of there turtles. Despite this, I believe the tick rate is at a perfect place right now, as the slower rotation due to a shrinkage of distance would mean that a player shouldn't really ever be in the storm taking damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Loot Pool**

This is one of the worst issues in the game to date. It is also one of the major reasons why Poach had to land containers when it existed. The Loot Pool is terrible as it ruins the competitive integrity of the game by making RNG the deciding factor in early game, and sometimes late game. Often times, it feels there aren't enough of the best weapons - pumps, Blue AK's, Scars, Heavy Snipers, RPGs - to go around. Sometimes, pros don't even have a shotgun going into a fight. This is due to the trash loot pool that exists in the game. Hunting Rifles have little to no use compared to silenced and heavy snipers. They need to go. The Infantry Rifle is the burst that was run over by a train. No one wants to ever find one. It needs to go. Tac shotguns have a 7.25 % drop rate in floor loot. This gun does not belong in competitive play as it doesn't deal enough damage, and no one wants to use it. If you give this 7.25 % rate to pumps and double each ones chance, it goes up from 7.45 % to 14.8 % in floor loot. This is a drastic change that gives double the players a much more viable shotgun in a fight, instead of fighting from a disadvantage unless they are in the same 1x1. Dual Pistols and Suppressed Pistols: These two weapons together make up 9 % of floor loot. Who actually wants to use these in the game? That is what I thought, no one! Vault them in competitive play. Sure people like to run around with them in casual matches, but they don't like seeing them when millions of dollars are on the line! This could be dedicated to weapons that are actually needed such as Pumps and SMGs. Next comes the worst part: empty or ammo. Floor loot has a 21.8 % chance of not even being there, being ammo at 14.5 %, consumables have an 11.6 % chance, and traps have a 4.7 % chance. This means that for a house with 4 spawns, you have a 7.5% chance of not getting a gun in a house. That doesn't seem like a lot, but considering the fact that this is a competitive mode we are speaking of, this should literally be impossible. Every house should be guaranteed an AR or close range weapon so that everyone has a fighting chance. Not having a gun puts you at the biggest disadvantage possible and means death if you land in a populated area. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Loot Pool Solution**

Epic needs to vault a butload of guns, ranging from dual pistols to the infantry rifle to the Tac Shotgun. Doing this would allow for the finding of other weapons that are truly useful and viable, leading to an increase in competitive integrity and overall less RNG. As well as this, ammo spawns on floors, as well as empty floor spawns need to be thrown out, and every house must guarantee an AR or close range weapon, ex: Pump, SMG,... 

&amp;#x200B;

**RNG**

Finally, I am brought on to the hardest topic of them all. The reason for this is that the Battle Royale genre is based around the idea of RNG. You drop in, receiving different loot every time, and you don't know where the next zone will take you. Is this competitive though? No it truly isn't. Does this make the game entertaining, though? Yes it most definitely does. Seeing players have to hike all the way across the map to pull out a victory is amazing and makes incredible moments, but should you see this consistently? No, storm should be a running distance from anywhere on the map, once it starts closing in at all times. This would mean that people are not subject to unnecessary damage, and often death due to pure bad luck. As well as this, every player should start with an AR and shotgun at the beginning of the game with 100 mats. This means that whenever you drop in, you will never be without a fighting chance due to bad luck. Yes, these weapons should be nerfed down a lot compared to even the white AR and green pump as it shouldn't be viable in late game. But, they should give everyone the chance, assuming they get extremely shitty luck. The last part of RNG I want to reference comes with OP weapons: the RPG, and Snipers. Yes, I saw the post earlier that said heavy snipers aren't OP. But to this I say that there should not be a gun in the game that does not allow a player to peak there head from a 1x1 due to the fact that one person got that lucky to have that gun. In competitive, top players are better with every gun. This goes for the Sniper, Minigun, and RPG as well. A good sniper such as Cloakzy denies an enemy from peaking at the risk of losing their life in a matter of .25 seconds. Is this fair? I leave that up to you guys and would love to hear your thoughts as a sniper is typically an important key to shooter games and it would be weird not having one, but I leave you with the thought that one shot from a half a second peak could leave a player with the loss of millions of dollars just because the person got lucky and found a sniper and they did not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to anyone who reads this. I am coming from a point of view where the competitive aspect of the game seems to be less and less competitive every day, and as someone who has loved comp games since I was young - Halo, COD, CS:GO, and Fortnite - I would hate to see the competitive community go to shit due to issues such as these. It would be awesome to get some feedback on my thoughts, as well as have this reach the community on a mass scale so we can start a conversation about the competitive changes that should occur, and it would be especially amazing to see some pros or epic employees' thoughts on the topics I proposed on balancing the game.

* If you are contested at your drop location, and your loot isn’t good enough, back off. Don’t go for pushes with bad loot. You can back off, farm some mats, rotate to loot. 
   * Example: My partner and I land at Lonely, cabin. We see that 2 teams are contesting as and have secured the outskirts of Lonely. We didn’t get good loot so we decided to take the air pockets and rotate to the outskirts and looting small buildings. 

2: Don’t always third party.

* Third partying 2 teams fighting, especially in duos, don’t end fast. Turtling is meta, when someone is in a turtle, the fight drags on, you want a fight to end fast. The longer the fight last, the chance of a 4th, or 5th party increases. 
* You should engage when the fight is over, and they are healing or looting.
* Engaging during the middle of a fight will make the fight longer as you would exchange shots, losing hit points, resulting in healing. 

3: Engage off of picks

* This tip mostly goes for mid game. 
* Before engaging, you need to assume that everyone is the same level as you, and has the same loot if not better. 
* Never engage without heavily damaging enemies. If you don’t, every fight you get in will be a 50-50. 

4: Knowing when to rotate late and early

* If the final zone is in storm, you rotate late and go off of picks. (this one is very situational) 
* If the zone is walkable, I would say 200-300 meters, try to rotate early and setup for picks. However, rotating late can also be an option. Depends on what you oppenents do, if you see a lot rotating early, rotate early with them. If none are rotating, rotate late. This is beacuse of your chance of getting lasered. If you are the only one rotating early, everyone that is camping, planning on rotating late, will laser you. If you are the only one rotating late, you would be getting spammed constantly spammed. 
* Again, study your opponents.  ",FortniteCompetitive

Heavy snipers should be vaulted. Here's why:

Although it does require some skill to use, it's honestly not that much. No weapon should be able to body shot someone with over 3/4 hp and kill them at 100+ meters, let alone 250+. The problem with the weapon is that it causes the most upsets in killing a player, ie it's the most common weapon used when a worse player kills a better player, you don't have to screw up to die but if you get one hit by a shotgun 9/10 times you screwed up your building, positioning or your own aim

Another huge problem is that it one shots any building no matter what. With how fast the bullet travels there is almost no response time to this either. This makes the heavy sniper explosive combo unreal, especially with the rpg. It also makes a double heavy snipe combo almost impossible to defend against unless you were already turbo building. Another negative about it one shotting walls is that it makes it very easy to replace someone's walls or w key them, which to be fair could be seen as a good thing since it's very hard to do this against a good player otherwise, without explosives or exploits.

I understand the argument that it has a long reload time and is loud, but that really doesn't matter and from an above average players standpoint isn't a sound argument at all.

First off the reload speed isn't even something that affects the player using the heavy sniper because you're normally waiting for your shot at a a semi close to medium range and once you shoot you either kill them, get them one hit, or miss. At that point you won't be sniping again anyways because you'll either be safe or have to fight. If you're not somewhat close to the player then the reload speed doesn't affect you anyways because you have more than enough time to reload and shoot if they decide to push you. If the player you shot at boxes up it wouldn't matter again because most people react before you would even reload a hunting rifle and build a box. And if you're super far away then it won't matter because you can fire pretty much unlimited shots without the person caring because the likely hood of you hitting them is super low, but if you hit them it's a kill or hugely devastating

Also the sound has basically no affect whatsoever, again with all of the situations above, they would know where you are with even a suppressed I weapon if you're taking a close range snipe, if you're pretty far away they're probably gonna box up or hide even if they didn't hear it, and even if it was as loud as an ar or shotgun they'd hear it either way. And at a super long range it doesn't even matter for the reasons previously stated (they won't care and they'd hear it even if it was the same decibel level as any other weapon)

The fact of the matter is that the heavy sniper will never be a balanced weapon in Fortnite with how it's intended to be. I understand that there is another argument that snipers are supposed to do a lot of damage but that's why we have the bolt and hunting rifle, they do insane damage too, and can one shot to the head but they CAN'T one shot to the body on someone with 150-157 health. Snipers do have their place in the game but this one doesn't. A body shot with a sniper should be rewarded with a lot of damage, not a kill. This is the skill gap of the sniper. Headshots should be an instant kill and body shots should do 1/2 health. It's just ridiculous how a weapon can literally do over 3/4 hp in a shot to your toe from 250m away.

Hopefully this post changes some of the players minds as to why the heavy sniper is op but not snipers in general.

Also, please please pleaseeeee at least put them in only supply drops (no vending machines) if you really want them in the game

TLDR, the negatives of the weapon don't really apply in most situations you use it in the strengths of it are just too good. We have the regular snipers for a reason. If you are good enough you can still one shot with hunting rifle or bolt. If epic wants them to stay at least make them supply drop only",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying Ninja playing a ranked test event is the same thing as every content creator grinding ranked, but I figured it was worth sharing.

&amp;#x200B;

Because he's playing with Reverse he's getting into 40-man endgames and has done quite well; his first game he got several strong tags and two tags in late game rotations. His midgame fighting is excellent, although he got tunnel visioned near the end which got him killed. He also separated a bit from Reverse, which led to an earlier death (they died before using their launch pad). 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I also wanted to share is that he's playing with Anonymous mode off -- obviously because it lets him see the big names that are in his game, but in a way, it's also giving exposure to smaller streamers/players with Twitch in their name. After he and Reverse died, he spectated the team that killed them and was very complimentary (they even had Twitch in their names).

&amp;#x200B;

Just figured I'd share. Oh, one last thing, on top of all this, his viewer count hasn't really gone down. Maybe this is the first step in opening up more of the community to the competitive side of this game we all (hate to) love.",FortniteCompetitive

OK I'm sorry but people need to chill tf out. These things are nowhere near the level of planes. They have 300 hp. They only carry 1 person. They don't fly. They can't mow down all of tilted in a few boosts. And, not only do they not have a turret, there is literally no offensive aspect to them. Ramming people for like 8 damage doesn't really matter. The only things they do are help for mobility, with boosts and the grappler. As for ppl saying its temporary shield. The thing gets mowed down by an AR in like 5 seconds lmao.

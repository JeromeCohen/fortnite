I used to go no smg but recently swapped to smg after a realization of how consistently I can shoot through turbo build along with the time to kill being insane with a blue smg

And I am aware the deagle is overpowered as a utility and being put into the right person’s hands


I’m interested in hearing other people’s opinions on what to carry in your “smg slot” and why.

My current logic is:

Blue smg &gt; deagle &gt; p90

The P90
Imo the worst as since it can’t shoot through turbo builds, but it’s great when late game rotating when having to drill through walls to rotate, and it’s time to kill is quick if you use it to follow up a pump shot (super useful in winter royale mat cap because there are a lot of people running around no building late game because they are out of mats)

The deagle 
I have this in the middle because it does a better job at breaking walls in a short period of time than the p90 and allows you to wall replace in an instant and is good to catch people of guard and even barrel stuff into peoples boxes which is getting really popular in a kill incentive environment. My issue with it is that in a late game situation when you don’t have many mats you will lose a lot of gun fights since you don’t have the most consistent combo to use to follow up a pump shot meanwhile others do

The smg
I feel like this is the best option because it’s fire rate is insanely fast. So it can shoot through turbo build if the play you are using it against is behind one layer of build and has above 30 or 50 ping (not sure of the actual ping mark)
Since you can do this it can grant you free kills as it’s very easy to get at least one wall replaced on someone’s turtle. A common thing I do to get free kills is replace someone’s wall, edit a window, then they put up a ramp and I just hold mouse1 and hit them 3-4 times through a stair giving me a free kill. Along with the fact of someone gets in your box or you get into someone’s box it excels. The gun rewards good aim in close range situations while following up a pump shot, can even reward you for bad aim by hands down winning you a shotgun fight because even if u miss ur pump shot you still have a good chance to win the fight.

And as for the downside many people see is it’s mag size and how it is always just empty when you swap to it.
My reply to these arguments would be that 30 low damage bullets isn’t a lot to pressure for a good length of time but you could just use and AR for that. Then also the gun always managing to be empty is because when you reload the gun it shows on the bullet count it’s loaded when it’s not, the simple fix to this is wait an extra half a second before you swap off of it.


TLDR: What fills your “smg slot” in the winter royale meta and why

My initial reflection and thoughts after a couple days.,"Hey everyone. Wanted to preface my post with a couple things that I'm sure I'll hear, so will get my points in ahead of time.

1. I  am a long-time controller player, playing games on  Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo consoles for more than 18 years since I was 5  years old. Only games I've ever played on KBM were Warcraft 3, Diablo 3,  and LoL. Also broke my left wrist, and it never healed properly so I'm  never going to feel 100% comfortable on a keyboard, so controller it is  for me.
2. Everyone  has a different financial situation, and this isn't meant to pressure  anyone - but it is meant to encourage those on the fence.

Let's  get into it: I am a controller player who had some success pubs and  displayed skill that wowed all my friends and people I played with on  PS4/Xbox. Still, I knew I wasn't really that good and was always very  inconsistent; I never got passed a 3KD and 20% WR (Xbox), but my  competitive itch was ignited with these pop-up cups. After getting a pin  in the solo scavenger cup, winning a couple duo scrims with partner,  and getting 15 points in my first Winter Royale sesh, I felt like I had  enough to justify taking Fortnite to a competitive level.

With  my Macbook dying off and being in a good financial spot in life, I was  able to look at gaming laptops as I travel for work. I found one I  really liked and made the investment. With the option to turn off  shadows, optimize settings, and even get into a bit of the stretched res  life, I have notice an IMMEDIATE improvement in my gameplay.

Sure,  my kills aren't as high as they were on console due to running into  better players mid and endgame, but I've already won a few solos and  duos. Haven't hopped back into scrims yet, but those are definitely up  next.

Here are the immediate improvements and differences for me:

**Framerate**:  with a 144hz monitor, the game runs so beautifully and any screen  tearing is gone. This helps with both flicks and tracking as players are  appearing on screen where they should be and your crosshair is much,  much more accurate.

**Game settings**:  My rig is very powerful and I also like the way the game looks so I've  yet to bring the shadows down all the way. Right now they're on medium.   But even with them on medium, literally everything is so much easier to  see and end game circles are much more responsive. I run a slight  stretch at 1580x1024 for performance and get 170+ frames in almost all  situations, with like \~130-140 in endgame.

Just  being able to see players more easily as well as wade through a place  like Wailing without worrying about people blending in to the treeline  is a MASSIVE boost to competitive FN.

**Responsiveness of controls**:  whatever the input lag is that comes with a console hurts the way  building responds. As a result I've noticed an uptick in how I fast I  can build battle. I thought I would get smacked in every buildfight, but  I've been able to win my fair share and also keep myself alive for a  decent period of time against the best players I've run into.

\----------

Here are some things to note:

PC  players can kill you from insane angles. The way they can flick, edit  and shoot is all very impressive and unsettling at first.

You  need to rebind your jump button; it is pretty much impossible to  compete on PC unless you can aim while jumping. If you have to take your  finger off the right stick for anything other than building 1x1s, you  are at an immediate disadvantage against a PC player who can aim in the  tiniest of gaps and hit flicks with their full range of arm motion.

If  you don't want to rebind, invest in a SCUF. Seriously. I got one for  shooters like Battlefield V and BO4 in addition to fortnite and have  since used it exclusively for FN. This gets around having to rebind jump  and lets you use a paddle for jumping for everything.

Gaming  rigs aren't \*that\* expensive. Okay, so they're basically crazy  expensive if you're only buying one to game but if you need a new  desktop, you definitely should look into some extra cash to get a GTX  1050/1060. Not too sure on AMD cards, but they're definitely solid and  usually run cheaper. There are rigs right now on best buy for $600 that I  know can run fortnite on competitive yet nice settings.

Controller  player dominance is definitely possible. Of course it's easy to cite  that only a few controller players qualified for the Winter Royale, but  so many people also think that switching to PC = switching to KBM. It's  not. Sure, KBM is basically the best available input system as a whole,  but in a game like Fortnite, you're never going to find the best ever  player or even the top 10 players. That's why in your grind to the top,  you should use what's most comfortable for you. Granted, for me, I have  limitations and am resigned to a controller.

Everyone  bashes controller, but that's because everyone equates controller as  console. It's not. The limitation is not the input method, it's the  gaming system itself. The differences between PC and console are  actually mindboggling, so much so that I'm convinced that the best  controller skill is plenty enough to make it big, and if you're  profoundly comfortable on one (or can't use KBM for prolonged periods  like me - even typing a lot at work can put strain on my wrist) and want  to be competitive - SWITCH. Seriously, you won't regret it.

I can't wait till I get into scrimming more often to see just how a big difference a PC can really make.

\---------

TL;DR:  If you're considering switching from console to PC but don't want to  relearn game with KBM, do it and play controller. The difference in  system is eye-opening and will objectively make you play better and  improve your game.",FortniteCompetitive

Shotguns are so close to being in a perfect state, but I think Epic may have went a bit too far initially. Please let me know your thoughts, I’m curious to hear what everyone else thinks about this update!    

The body shot damage of pump shotguns is insane, coupled with a minimum of 3 pellets hitting; it almost seems to encourage aiming for the chest instead of the head.     

Right now there are three shotguns that can body shot a player at 100hp and kill them. All three of these shotguns can be found on the floor, which increases rng off spawn more than you’d think. (ie: you land on a green pump and do 95 damage to the body, but his gold pump kills you.)     

I believe that the heavy shotgun should be introduced to the floor loot pool, since the max body damage is much less &amp; it rewards precise headshot accuracy; and that the epic and legendary pumps reserved to chest/supply drop loot.     

TLDR; I disagree with the shotgun body shot damage in 6.31, but agree with the headshot damage.     ",FortniteCompetitive

I think its dumb that traps placed within the first 20 seconds of a match should kill in mid game. I hate when traps kill you and it says you ""played yourself"". Propose a few changes to traps:
1) Traps have a time limit for example 60 seconds. This will create a higher skill ceiling and enable for outplay instead of luck.
2) Whenever someone kills a player, their traps convert teams. For example if I kill a not and they have traps active, their traps are mine.
3) This is a different solution to traps, whenever someone dies, the wall (ceiling or floor) on which a trap is placed gets 1hp. The trap is now neutral. Everyone is granted rights to repair it. Whoever repairs it for 100wood/brick/metal gains rights to the trap. (This could work for builds too)
4) When a player is eliminated, their traps are dropped. This will balance out the trap economy when traps are rarer due to turrets taking their place.

42,ARBinit,1543815472,a2lnvt,19,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a2lnvt/suggestion_smart_editing_option/,1,Suggestion: Smart Editing Option,"I posted this on r/ForniteBR but realized it's something a casual player wouldn't fully understand.

On console editing can often be finicky (on PC a bit too) - where you think you have halfed the stairs but it doesn't go. Or you think you made your bottom right triangle on a wall but the precision was slightly off.

​I would suggest a new option called Smart Editing, which basically **treats edits that are close enough as what they are intended to do**. The are two main questions 1) how can Epic even pull this off? 2) does this lower the skill cap?

**1) How can epic even pull this off?**

When Apple was creating the iPhone, they first made a version of the keyboard we all are used to now on Smartphones where you just touch the screen with each finger (multi-touch). The problem is, your finger can often miss precision. So you may hit the key next to another key by accident. It was hard to have the right precision (similar to editing). It was a big problem so they said to every programmer, go away and try to come up with a better keyboard. Everyone came back two weeks later with their version and there were some crazy suggestions. One person though developed a keyboard that look exactly the same but it just worked. What was the difference? When a user hit the letter T, and then went to hit H to spell THE, the H on the screen stayed the same size, but the hit box got slightly bigger. **Using historical data to see what users were likely trying to do can allow you to make smarter precision decisions.** For Fortnite, Epic would take all the data it has on users editing paired with some reasonable estimates (i.e. if a user is roughly swiping the right side of a stairs, and just misses the last piece before confirming, assume they weren't trying to select two boxes which isn't even a thing). The rule would be something like:

`if Edit == Good, then Edit, else`

`if Edit not = Good &amp; Edit == fairly close to a Edit that does work (some metric here), then do estimated Edit, else`

`do not Edit`

Epic has actually a great dataset on this which is, when users go to make an edit, confirms, and nothing happens. So they then go back a second time and do the edit they want. That dataset is partially noisy given when you go back to do an E\\edit, you may try a different one, but generally you go for what you intended. Every dataset has noise but if they come up with a good model that reasonably figures out what the users retry action was, then that's a fairly good test. You can probably do this without that data but it's just a bonus if they want to.

**2) Does this lower the skill cap?**

This is a common thing people like to say whenever the game mechanics change to make it easier for players to do X. Before turbo building, auto material change, different sensitives for building/shooting, and builder pro - I had posted many times about ideas like them and people commented, oh that just lowers the skill cap. Let's take auto material change for example. In the past, you would be in a build fight and go to place a wall and potentially not place it because you were on an empty material. So you toggled to the next material. Instead of people focusing on building, their focus goes to intra-build fight keeping an eye on each material. With the auto material change, **it allowed people to focus on what really should matter,** which in this case should be getting better at building. A change like this would allow people to focus on building paired with editing and not focus on the annoyance of an edit not working as intended. **Yes, precision matters for aiming, but that is a mechanic where it should matter. For editing, that process should be as smooth as possible to create a better experience and push players to focus more on building/editing together.**",FortniteCompetitive

I haven't liked them for about 2 to 3 season now, and actually made a video, which I unlisted, about how they will be over buffed and contribute more to the spam meta. In my opinion, current SMGs require no skill and in fact are the best, common gun in the game. I'd take SMG over pump as a first gun on drop, over tac, over AR, over splode. It's finally reached the point where mostly every player, good or bad, has caught up to the meta of if I build, they spray, and SMG is usually the go to for it. I think that current SMGs are bad for the game, but SMGs that did low damage to structures, high damage to players (same damage as they do now, lower structure damage), would actually bring much needed skill into the game. IMO this is the perfect time to talk about it, seeing as I can imagine soon there will be some kind of dynamic looting system where higher rarity weapons and splodes won't be available in the normal chest loot table. We have guns in the game besides spam that counter turtle building (i.e. splodes, deagle, heavy snipes), and I don't think that a general common SMG should fulfill that role, let alone have an easily obtainable upgraded version that dominates that role.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my thoughts on current SMGs. I feel like they are too strong, even the hands of those who don't know how to use them. If I get spammed out, let it be with an AR so I can actually retaliate, not a 40 round magazine build and flesh shredder.

&amp;#x200B;

This creates more incentive for early game kills so you can go into late game with more mats, thus both reducing the number of players end game AND buffing mat count. 

 

just my 2 cents feel free to change this suggestion or add to it.

&amp;#x200B;

i dont think the game should give you free mats like it does with health but increase the capability for max mats.

&amp;#x200B;

it can also be on a kill basis like the point system. So every kill you get in relation to the storm you get X mat cap increase 

so 

e.g

60 people left storm one 

\-100 mats to all types if you are below 2 kills +50 if you are 2 kills and above and so on.

numbers can change just a suggestion thanks for attending my ted talk have a great day",FortniteCompetitive

So I'm interested in knowing what people currently think of bloom in the game. Does it take away from the skill gap, should it be in the game, should it be changed, what's your opinion?  
I'm also wondering where Shooting Test #2 went. If you're unaware Shooting Test #1 was an LTM that came out after around two to three months of Fortnite: Battle Royale being out. This LTM was to test possible changes coming to the game. The LTM added damage dropoff to most weapons in the game, introduced first shot accuracy, and nerfed shotgun headshot damage. You can find the full Shooting Test #1 article [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUkFYTxMhg). People were happy with these changes and they went into the actual game and we still see damage dropoff and first shot accuracy here today. After the first test was concluded we were told a second one would occur that would contain no bloom when spraying, not jumping, and not moving around too much. This test would also add recoil to the weapons in the game requiring, in my opinion, a higher skill gap. These changes actually went live in-game unintentionally for some time and you can see them [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUkFYTxMhg). Shooting Test #2 also came out for a bit although was removed quickly after.

&amp;#x200B;

So, where is Shooting Test #2 and don't we at least deserve to see what the game would be like with a higher skill gap?",FortniteCompetitive

Campfire+slurp

Math explanation: 

5 bandages example 
1 bandage heals 15 health over 3 seconds and the storm does 24 damage over 3 seconds so you’re losing 9 health per 3 seconds instead of 24 per 3 seconds. 
3 health lost per second instead of 8 for 15 seconds  3x15 is 45 so you have 55 health left and ticking for 8, 55 divided by 8 rounds up to 7 seconds so you have 22 seconds to live compared to 13 seconds without meds

Medkits allow 12 seconds per medkits plus 13 seconds of applied at the right time 

Campfires and slurps 
Campfires heal for 2 health per second and slurps for 1 
1 slurp max at a time and 4 campfires max at a time 
Add up the amount of heals per second and subtract them from 8 
And divide the health taken per second from 100

Example: 1 campfire 1 slurp
Adds up to 3 hp per second 
8-3=5 
100 divided by 5 equals 20 seconds

Medkit/bandage/slurp/campfire combos 
Medkits plus slurp or campfire is a overkill and will most likely let you survive the longest 
Bandages plus slurp or campfire would be over kill too but the math would be easy just figure out heals per second and subtract 8 blah blah blah

&amp;#x200B;

But still, the same problem persists. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are my specs (not insane, but good enough to comfortably run Fortnite at 120 FPS on low settings):

&amp;#x200B;

AMD Ryzen 3 Processor   
Alpenphön Kühler   
8 GB RAM Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060  
B350 Mainboard   
120GB NVMe  
1000 GB HDD Hard drive

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm not gonna lie, I have no idea what any of this means but I've been told these specs are alright.

And even with this it struggles to even reach 120 FPS, I'm always between 60-110 FPS and it's impossible to play with this inconsistency.

I've also tried using a friend's pc and just kept my own hard drive and SSD and at first I had 119-120 FPS smooth but every time I'd glide and also after gliding, I'd have 30-50 FPS for around 40 seconds.

Also, I'm playing on stretched res to try and boost my FPS and I get these results.

On another note, same happens when I play Overwatch or any other game. Just random FPS drops or small stutters.

&amp;#x200B;

I myself don't understand shit about Computers but I have friends that do and even them have no idea what the problem could be. The last thing we're suspecting could be the problem would be that the power from the outlet isn't strong enough or something.

So, if anyone has an idea, please, PLEASE help me, I'm desperate :(

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: Good PC, can't consistently stay on 120 FPS. Tried this with several other PCs, same results. I need help",FortniteCompetitive

Here are a few reasons why it wouldn't work.

1. A competitive mode needs a way to rank people. The way the tournaments work, is they assign points based on the rules for that tournament. A competitive mode would need to adjust your rank for each game you play. The question is how do you calculate that? If it's by placement, people will hide and get into a high rank and people that hot drop will fall down the ladder. If it's based on kills, how much rank should you earn per kill? 

2. The second problem is match making. At the lowest and highest tiers of match making, it would be extremely hard to find fair matches of 100 people at all hours of the day. Que times would be so high that most people would just play a pub match anyway. 

3. Another problem it would create is what happens to the casual player. Casual playlists would feel like 50v50 and the new rumble ltm. Full of bots. But maybe they don't want the frustrating high octane gameplay of a competitive playlist, but the game would be unfun for them if everyone was bad. 

Don't get me wrong though, I'm not a fan of the current format. I think that scrim discords should be allowed to have their own custom games, and the tournament times aren't very flexible currently. I think there's a lot yo be improved upon, but I dont think a competitive mode/playlist is what Fortnite needs. I think it would do more harm than good.",FortniteCompetitive

MMO mice make managing the keybinds on fortnite much easier with all the side buttons. And from what I’ve read FPS mice have the speed and consistency with aim due to the lighter weight and better shapes. 

I started playing on PC this summer with an MMO mouse because it meant that I didn’t have to learn as many keybinds and could get back to the level I was at on console/surpass it faster. 

Now that I’m completely comfortable with the MMO mouse and my keybinds I can only wonder how much better I might play if I was using an FPS mouse because it’s lighter and my aim should be more consistent, maybe even better. 

The trade off means learning a lot more keybinds. If I use a mouse with two side buttons that means I’ll still have to learn six new keybinds on my keyboard, that’s gonna be a challenge.

What’s the community think? FPS or MMO mouse? Should I make the switch? Think I’ll be a better player in the long run with a FPS mouse?",FortniteCompetitive

Others have responded to this idea with potential cons as it being too clunky/inconsistent (if the binds were button combos), adding an unfair advantage to those with multiple paddle controllers, or even just adding another skillgap on console which Epic may be against. All of these ideas have merit imo, though I would still be in favor of weapon binds being added in some form.

&amp;#x200B;

If that isn't going to come however, I have a compromise. A default weapon option. Much like the reset building option that was important to use for muscle memory in the combat pro days, you could select a weapon slot (say 2, where most players keep their shotgun) and every time you put your pickaxe or builds away that is the weapon that would pull out, regardless of whether you were on another slot before you started building. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know your thoughts. I think this would be a pretty easy feature to implement and would be very helpful for controller players

So hitting 10 or 20 with a blue pump will now award 30. This change has its positives as it makes the shotgun damage more consistent BUT it definitely seems cheesy and is, by definition, rewarding people for missing.  So tell me what you guys think of this possible solution and compromise. For ALL shotgun blasts they reduce the number of pellets by 50%, increase the pellets damage x2, and increase the SIZE of the pellets x2. By doing this the damage of the shotgun will remain exactly the same but will give more leeway with each shot. That 10 damage pellet you hit with before will now do 20 damage but the game never awarded you extra damage. The drawback and downside i can think of is that it might make shotguns too easy to use but id have to try it out to know for sure. Thoughts?  


TLDR;   
Shotgun Pellet Overhaul Suggestion:  
Reduce the number of pellets by 50%, increase the pellets damage x2, and increase the SIZE of the pellets x2. Creating more consistent damage without granting magic bonus damage.

Fights are finishing faster, and taking 50/50 fights is a lot more punishing.

Despite of the positives, I don't believe the bonus 3 pellet damage should remain. Shotguns had and still have a problem with registering shots, but damage values were never inconsistent. For those people complaining about hitting 7s, the only thing inconsistent is your aim. 

If you land 1 pellet, you get 1 pellet worth of damage. Why do you deserve more? You can literally flick in the general direction of your opponent 3 tiles away without aiming properly and still land 25 damage by barely tagging him with 1 pellet. It doesn't make any sense. 

Extra: I have seen countless amount of videos complaining about shotguns being inconsistent, yet I have never seen any solid evidence. There were people complaining about headshot damage not being applied, but the slowed down video shows that he hit the neck. There were also complaints like [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u20EO9IX5t0), but if you slow it down to 0.25 you can  see why he is hitting such low values. ",FortniteCompetitive

\## PATCH NOTES

\*\*BUG FIXES\*\*

Fixed a bug where the FPS cap was not saving.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*MINOR CHANGES\*\*

Added a button to Launch Fortnite after applying your settings.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*MAJOR ADDITIONS\*\*

Decreased file size by 30MB!

Added an error message that is displayed when your game settings file is set to read-only.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd also like to clear up a couple of misconceptions some people had about the tool.

1. The tool does not change the graphics driver settings, only the game settings, meaning you will still have to add a custom resolution on your graphics card.
2. This tool is really only a QoL improvement for people like me, that don't want to go into the files every time they want to change their resolution.

A lot of the content pertains to the competitive scene but will obviously be reflected in casual.

""____"" should change | Why? | Possible Fix
---|---|----
Grappler | It provides too much utility for a single item. It allows you to make plays with too little effort. For 1 use, you can retake high ground (upwards of 8 tiles?), negate fall damage by resetting your momentum, and quickly rotate to zone if you chain uses. IMO it allows you to gain too much positional advantage without doing anything but m1. | Not allow you to grapple to structures that are not finished building. It allows high ground to still be challenged if they are tarping, as their old structures will be old enough to be grappled to, but doesn't allow you to take fights by gaining a cqc position that  you did not deserve to get. Still allows rotational affect as most structures are built and you can still chain grapple the world (ground/trees/buildings).
Pump Shotgun | With the latest patch, the effectiveness of the pump shotgun is too dependent on it's rarity. The effective killing potential of a weapon shouldn't be tied to RNG. For example, the gold pump allows you to miss 1 pellet (11 damage) and still be able to crit 209, the rarity of blue (or higher) pump allows you body &gt;= 100 damage. |  Vault purple/gold pump. Change damage of pumps: Green(Base:90, Crit:200), Blue(Base:95, Crit: 200). The reason for changing base values is because accuracy should be rewarded and you do that by instead changing the HS multiplier to max at 200 instead of raising base damage and keeping the HS multiplier the same. 
Heavy Shotgun | It seems like they nerfed the range of the pump shotgun so that the heavy shotgun would fill a niche of having burst damage at a range. To me, the heavy shotgun fills the role of having purple/gold rarities for the pump and should be reflected as such. | Purple/Gold(Base: 73.5/77 (same as currently), Crit: 200).
Grenade Launcher | Too spammable. Can carry potential 18 shots + reserve from teammates. | Vault. Grenades/Clingers/Dynamite fill the spammable splode niche and have a &lt;= 10 max stack. They also cannot be replenished by teammates without taking extra inventory.
Rocket Launcher | Precision splode that can reset high ground, force people to engage if they are close (endgame), spam low ground with high base damage/structure damage.  | Either slower reload time or cap ammo limit further to prevent mindless spamming of rockets and make each rocket more of a calculated utility tool. Possibly lower base damage (80) or develop damage dropoff.
Quad Launcher | Spammable splode that has a small explosion radius, and thus can be used as a CQC / structure splode spam. | Vault.
Burst Assault Rifle | Bad structure DPS, Highly dependent on bloom for player DPS (even with FSA). | Vault. Doesn't fill a niche besides having a low percentage chance of dealing high DPS in exchange of it's faults.
Tactical Shotgun | Chance of hitting full pellet crit is extremely low unless barrel stuffing, and that role is taken by the double barrel shotgun. | Decrease spread of pellets and remove grey tac.
Heavy Sniper Rifle | 150 body shot with less bullet drop &gt;&gt; slower reload time. The benefits highly outweigh the disadvantage. | Remove the heavy sniper and blue bolt action sniper. Scoped Snipers are now purple/gold rarity, reload speed of blue bolt (3 sec), 110/120 base damage, bullet drop of bolt, and can deal the same structure damage as the heavy counterpart. Essentially make the bolt have high structure damage.
Hand Cannon | Too spammable since all fresh structures can be 1 shotted. Trading 1 heavy shot for 10 of **any** material is too good of a deal. Does not need to peek long to hit structures so it's hard to get a spammer off you without using utility (grenades/stinks/ect.) or risk peeking a high dmg and quick peeking player.  Damage is too high to be balanced with high structure damage.| Make fresh metal not 1 shot, either by capping deagle structure damage or increasing metal fresh starting health (could cause meta problems). There needs to be a counter to be being spammed by a deagle in endgame when you either take the risk of shooting back (when they barely have to peek). Switching to metal will discourage the spammer as they can find other people to target by only using 1 shot on wood or brick. Having structure damage is a good buff to the deagle, but it's damage is too high to be a balanced weapon. Without having to think of damage drop off for each rarity, max crit should be &lt;150, and max body &lt; 70.
Compact SMG | The regular SMG fills the niche fine, there doesn't need to be a upgrade that has higher capacity and tighter bloom (I think?). With the amount of phasing happening via m1 + W, a higher capacity and structure damage is not needed. | Vault. Keep Regular SMG as it is.
Heavy Assault Rifle| Max crit is too high for the fire rate.  | Lower max crit to 70
+50 HP per kill | Good addition, minor change. Instant healing allows a player to play overly confident. A player is more inclined to take a fight (even if it means its more likely to trade damage) since they are instantly replenished after the kill. This may seem beneficial for people who don't enjoy watching turtle game, but it encourages fights where someone who has an inherent situational disadvantage but will still engage. Another scenario, a player on spawn who gets a quick kill has an advantage on his surrounding players by having more health and no expense of time looting or consuming. I think a lot of casual players don't realize, but a lot of good players will play more aggressive since they are punished less for taking aggressive fights. | Healing is granted via a slurp effect (that can stack with consecutive kills). Thus you are still rewarded for earning a kill, but punished by time for taking damage. 
Material Cap | It seems like we're going to be testing mat cap within the competitive scene for a little while so it deserves some input. Some people like the 1500 total mat cap because there's less heal offs endgame,  but in reality it just leaves people who were punished by RNG (zone, utility) to have a large disadvantage since they need to expend their materials for rotations and are left endgame having to take fights that they have a disadvantage in. IMO it decreases the skill gap not letting the endgame players use a main mechanic of the game because they had bad RNG. You might say it increases the skill gap in ways such as resource management, or situational awareness, well this is true, I think material problems wouldn't have an issue if endgame was changed via storm. | Increase farm rate to 1.4x or higher. Increase total mat count to at least 2250 for solos.
Storm| Change this to fix endgame | Bring back the storm pulse that destroys structures, but implement it correctly so that it actually only destroys structures at the zone edge. This zone still encourages endgame fighting and will likely prevent heal offs of multiple high ground layers.
Glider Redploy | Hard topic to discuss. I think it belongs in the game but the high ground dynamic will need to change. If implemented with zone structure damage it will prevent multiple high ground layer heal offs since it will force high ground to fall down | Add redeploy with 35m deploy height, change jump pad, and rift to go deploy height back to 15m.

My suggestion is to add a separate sensitivity for building and shooting weapons. Console has had this option, but PC players lack it. If PC players were able to lower their sensitivities to shoot weapons, and build on a higher sensitivity, tournaments and the comp side for Fortnite would be a lot more competitive.

Otherwise, if every person in the town you land in just gets a grey assault rifle, then sure it is balanced, but gameplay will become boring. People complain, “Wow the guy got an RPG out of his first chest,” and I agree when someone gets a good gun at the start of the match it is hard to counter.  But in reality, that happens so rarely, and sometimes a surprise is needed to spice up the game. 

Now about the late game circle movement. Having to run to the opposite side of the zone is frustrating and many times that had probably made people lose the game. Back to how it used to be though, before season 5 end game felt so much less exciting. You could just sit in one box and be fine. Now players have progressed having it reverted would make for horrible gameplay in scrims and skirmishes especially.

\&gt; custom crosshairs

\&gt; release &lt;edit button&gt; to confirm edit

\&gt; player pov minimap

\&gt; access inventory while running { so i can ditch my chillers on the go }

\&gt; option to automatically replace items of higher rarity

\&gt; switching challenge will not grant same type of challenge

\&gt; change rift color so its easier to see from the sky on desert

\&gt; reload to cancel reloading + item use. right now i have to mash my keyboard with my face, it barely works

195,alric8,1543620963,a1xqrp,110,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a1xqrp/kittyplays_vs_yoyokeepitup_a_little_known_but/,1,"KittyPlays vs Yoyokeepitup: A little known (but true) story of one of the longest, beefiest rivalries in competitive(ish) fortnite","First, this sounds like a shitpost. I promise it's not. And this is far too high quality for anyone to car that it's basically TMZ.  
Fortnite's competitive scene is pretty young but some rivalries, have already developed; We all know about Nick vs Aydan, Saf vs ZexRow and Reddit vs everyone they can possibly duel.

  
But one which I feel people have somewhat ignored but is a very nice story is the one I am about to tell.  
Back in week 1 of the Summer Skirmish KittyPlays got an invite and decided to invite Tfue as a partner because who doesn't want to be paired with a good player. It was a success as they placed 5th behind the 4 dominant duos.  
Anyway, it's week 3 and Kitty gets invited again. Unfortunately for her, no popular good players are available, so she invites Pokimane instead to form an all-girl team because why not.

  
Meanwhile, a lesser known player called Yoyokeepitup, an excellent player only with a slight glimmer of fame after spectacularly 1v2ing Ninja and Dakotaz in a pretty impossible situation in a random pub encounter, is gearing up for his 1st skirmish, which he was invited to after impressive showdown performances. He partners former Minecraft youtuber PainfulPVP.

  
Kitty and Pokimane struggle massively. If you want a detailed explanation I suggest you read this brilliant article by [u/Zimzams123](https://www.reddit.com/user/Zimzams123). Basically though, they are barely competitive and end up being free kills with loot which massively benefits their killers. And twice said lucky killers were the Yoyo/Painful duo. The second time Yoyo, surprised at how easily he is able to kill the duo, L-Dances on them, angering kitty in particular and persuading them to straight up stop the tournament. This is where the heat starts.

  
Week 4, and guess what? Yoyo and Kitty are both invited to the solo round. We enter Game 1 and guess who is the first person in the lobby to die in game 1? It's Yoyo! And guess what? It is Kitty who kills him.

  
They then manage to avoid each other for a while. Kitty finds herself in the same predicament during twitch rivals though, unable to find good players she knows. So she goes into the Procord and hunts down some unknown talent. In week 6 she plays with Kreo. It is a massive success as the pair place 4th on day 2.

Kitty realises at this point that a pro teammate is the way and she teams with Bizzle in week 7, winning two games and placing highly every time. It's fair to say shew pretty quickly becomes quite the- erm... fan of Bizzle.

Anyway, Kitty starts getting to know a lot of pros, such as Ceice who partners her in various pubstomping tournaments.  She doesn't get invited to another duo skirmish until week 5 in Fall. This time she chooses Gorilla (an experienced IGL for nV) as her teammate, in a stacked field including Yoyo, who plays with OutLIT.

And the two duos meet multiple times, with Yoyo and mate comfortably killing them on both occasions. A less than impressed Kitty complains and starts channelling her inner Soar calling them clout chasers. Gorilla follows on with her, probably trying not to tilt Kitty anymore mostly.

Yoyo though isn't impressed. He tweets angrily at Gorilla and Kitty about their words, before sarcastically making 'clout chaser' his stream title for the next 3 days.

This is as far as the rivalry has got so far. I hope people enjoyed reading this peculiar and pretty funny story though.",FortniteCompetitive

To save you a click: 

*I am completely faint of fortnite. It's a fun game but I'm tired of always taking on players that I do not stand a chance against. Why are the fortnite developers not accounted for with the level difference? It would make the game more fun for everyone if it is divided into three different levels. Noobs, advanced and pro players. For the pro players, the game would be a lot more challenging too.*  
*I think it's a good advice for the fortnite developers if they rank the fortnite players on the basis of their wins and kills.*

&amp;#x200B;

New players and casuals hate playing against ""sweats"". I couldn't imagine being a new player or a player that hasnt reached a level to where they are comfortable, the various levels of skill you must come across must be frustrating. They can keep making the game ""noob-friendly"" but these players that they are catering too would have a much better experience by constantly playing against players around their skill level. With these pop-up cup tests I hope they are gearing towards a steady mode and not scheduled events. Having both though would be the perfect situation. I guess we'll find out ""soon"".

218,Janukenasl,1543602361,a1v0m0,40,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a1v0m0/supply_drops_do_not_feel_impactful/,1,Supply drops do not feel impactful,"This topic is very rarely mentioned but I think it could cause major change for the better.

In my eyes, supply drops are not valuable enough for anyone to contest them. When comparing to PUBG for example I think that fortnite is lacking, in PUBG supply drops feel really important and are almost always fought for by at least two teams. That is because the weapons or gear you get from them makes gameplay different, it kind of breaks of from usual load outs. So that brings me to my suggestion:

Supply drops should have a separate loot pool that would not overlap with chests or floor drops.
Why this would be better than the current situation:

Supply drops become a mid game hot-spot and is a fun feature for all.
Currently mid game rotations are a bit lacking and kind of random, as in it is a bit difficult to predict where people will go and sometimes it's impossible to cut of someone rotating (rifts, launch pads). Air drops placed at random locations in zone for everyone to fight over would make the game plan a bit more predictable almost like team fights over drake in league. The good players would move in closer to them for a large team fight with multiple people and the casuals would move away.

Looting becomes less RNG based.
Now this is open for debate and I'll explain how I would change it, however some might not agree with it. Feel free to leave suggestions below.

Here is what imo should be solely in supply drops:

All heavy versions of weapons (not sure how to deal with epic rarity)

Double barrel

Golden pump

P90

All explosives

I chose these not because I hate playing against them, but because they change gameplay compared to normal setups in some crucial way. Be it dps and clip size, range or even how you approach fights.

Great for competitive, multiple teams fighting for a major advantage in late game.
We all know that comp gameplay is a lot slower compared to pubs (which is completely normal) but epic doesn't like that. Mid game usually ends up being very lackluster and elims pile up at the end. Supply drops giving players advantages over others would be important enough to fight over, which would make the elims curve out a bit better and reducing the massive spike at end game.

Getting the rare weapons would keep casual players entertained.
Kind of self explanatory, finding a rocket launcher would become a much more exciting experience for less skilled players. Therefore it would keep them playing for more hoping to try it again (not a key point, just thought I would mention it)

That's all I could come up with, if you have anything positive (OR NEGATIVE) to add please do.

The constantly moving circles only pushes everyone in one direction which allows for people to have to waste mats trying to build walls to prevent being shot in the back. This especially becomes a problem in Winter Royale, where a lot of people lost multiple games because they ran out of materials endgame while trying to get to circle... Since the moving circles also do 5-10 damage, you will most likely have to heal if you get in the storm, but you don't have time to do that if you have to keep moving again. The moving circles also disregards rewarding people for positioning. If someone is positioned correctly in circles, it should be a good reward for them, instead of having to most of the time walk on to the complete other side of the circle and wait for the storm to move over to the new circle. The moving circles feels too dramatic and player vs game.",FortniteCompetitive

I can see why they made it slow, you can't push people as quickly as you could before but  you can still survive from really high build fights. But to be honest it's better to have it removed if they're not willing to change the speed because again when you're in the air your really susceptible to being shot at and if they have really good aim they can lazer you so it just becomes obsolete. 

A possible change they could make would be to start at the slow speed but slowly your speed increases the longer you are in the air going in one general direction. So if you got max speed and decided to go backwards you would loose a lot of the speed you gained. 

NOTE: This should not apply to the regular glider when using launch pads or jumping from the battle bus etc. 

This way you can't just jump off a building and instantly get over to someone in 2 seconds you would have to wait until you built up speed. Which would mean you would have to be smart about how you use the glider re-deploy. You would also have to invest more materials into building higher ramps to get enough height to get a lot of speed. You'd also be harder to hit if you had to jump off a giant build fight and fly off since you would start to speed up making it harder to hit you. 

I think this would be the best of both worlds since you can rotate faster with glider re-deploy but not to the extent of going from one building to the next in minutes. You also become vulnerable while you wait to start speeding up so if a player catches you at the right time (and he/she has good aim) they will be able to shoot you down.

My medium-long range aim is above average but my CQC aim doenst hold up, I miss a lot of shots that i shouldnt. I tried lowering even more my sens but it didnt help.


Then i tried switching my sens and DPI and bingo. So if you have the same problem that i do, **i suggest you lowering you DPI and increasing your ingame sens but keeping the same *real sensitivity* (dpi * ingame sens)**.

The result is a not so smooth aiming, but it helps with flick shots and doesnt register some unwanted movements. It helps with building too. Its hard to explain, but it feels better. On the other hand, it isnt as good as high dpi for long range AR engagements.

Of course, this is my personal experience. Maybe it doesnt affect you as such, but maybe it can help some people.

They could make it only work in 1  tile range as best to help with the barrelstuffing weird camera angle.

Personally, I would say the pump is in a solid state of being good (in my opinion far better than the tactical), but not at a point of being overpowered. The tactical is good for new players  (far more skilled than the drum gun was, yet not very difficult to use) however in many situations is easily outplayed by the pump. The heavy is a good mix of both and the extra range (now that pumps have a larger falloff) is a bonus. The double barrel is controversial. From my view it is viable in solos and pretty terrible in anything with more players to fight at once. It easily beats any other shotgun when you are in someone’s one by one and is very easy to use, therefore you trade the ability to flick shot, do quick peek shots and use the trick of shooting and quickly placing  a floor below you, etc.

Personally I’ve been playing since near the beginning of season 1 and shotguns as well as the game in general is in a very good state.",FortniteCompetitive

Hear me out.,"Fortnite gives us so many ways to outplay opponents compared to pubg and h1z1 because of building, editing, and general game knowledge. It's true that battle royale games benefit from a low skill gap so that bad players will spend money and keep playing. I just don't think epic will benefit from this in the long run because of the unavoidable skill gap that comes with the mechanics of building and editing. Yes adding items and guns that close the skill gap and gives bad players a few cheese kills might keep bad players iterested for a bit, but what really keeps us interested in a game with a naturally high skill gap like fortnite is understanding that there are probably millions of players better than you. You know you can be that good if you work hard like them and practice so we set goals and learn the game. Learning a game is hard and time consuming but it's fun and clearly seeing players better than you is motivational. This is why I really like the idea of a separate competitive playlist because it gives bad players a chance to learn without getting stomped in a pub. I really think epic should give up on closing the skill gap and focus on tweaking/removing weapons that make the game feel too casual, because no matter how much epic tries to close the skill gap it will still remain big which is why we see most of the bad players flock to ltms and 50v50 because it gives them a chance to learn against bad players while also getting kills and keeping it casual.",FortniteCompetitive

After watching the pro’s play the pop up cub. It became obvious that this is not giving a good viewer experience or a good competitive environment. It rewards pocking more than fighting and it gets a 3party fest in most cases. If u fight now everybody stops so they can get there free damage and move on or the entire lobby focuses 1 guy in a pinch. I get that u don’t want a big amount of players alive at the end circles, but that has a different reason than player not wanting to fight. Its simply not rewarding to fight in the midgame. U get almost nothing out of it while risking a lot. With the lower madcap its not even rewarding to get there mats and if players have mobility items (what give a great late game advantage) they will use it to disengage the fight so u are never getting it, unless u get somebody unexpected. What needs to happen is that Items or the matcap gives you and advantage if u play aggressive mid game. So give a risk reward opportunity  in the midgame. 

The community knows this and is already talking about it.

In the second and third circle there should be around 5 supply drops that a visible on the mini map.

\- with a gold weapon 

\- a mobility item: grappler (2 in duo’s), rift to go or a launchpad.

\- Shields 

Give a mat cap increase for kills

This will give players a fair way to fight for late game advantage in the midgame, that should always be the way to play midgame, in a lot of sports  and games its already like that. If there are 50 players left after the 3 circle it should be fine. It fun to watch these stacked late games and now that a lot of players played in the popup cups they will know the feeling and reason better so they will enjoy it more.  ",FortniteCompetitive

- While I think it’s important for players to adapt to the new resource economy, I don’t think it should come at the cost of adding a new variable of RNG to the late game meta. I believe that there are better ways to implement the new resource management system into the game. 

The Proposed Solution

- Award only players in Top 10 or Top 15 a very small amount of materials for each kill they earn (between 50 and 150). 

- Under most circumstances I would vehemently disagree with awarding players materials for kills; however, I think players should be awarded for killing some of the most skilled players that are able to make it to the Top 10 or Top 15 consistently. 

- Let’s have a discussion about this to figure out the best solution to alleviate this problem. The faster we find an answer, the quicker Epic will be able to add a ranked playlist! ",FortniteCompetitive

After being the #1 team in FNPL my team and I got pulled up into the ""pro"" discord. When PAX West was announced to be the finals of the Summer Skirmish I bought my tickets and headed to Seattle to compete as a free agent. After ending the event at 8th place I began gaining attention from organizations. Ghost gaming picked me up right before the Fall Skirmish began and I competed in multiple weeks. During the Fall Skirmish finals at TwitchCon, my duo Kayuun and I managed to get 5th place.

It's super punishable to use, and you're almost a free kill if you use it around enemies. It's completely a last ditch effort to survive being knocked down.

It's still fast enough that it's more efficient than running in long rotations.

A lot of people think it's too slow, but I think the slow speed adds a ton of risk that it needed and didn't have before.

It also doesn't undermine the value of the launch pad like it did before.

I think it's great.

Over many hours of practice I have fine tuned my mechanics in both solo drills, 1v1s, 2v2s, and the occasional free for all battle (1v1v1 or 1v1v1v1).  However, when I go into an actual game, both pub and scrim, the only strength I see myself carrying over is the ability to play end game scrims fairly well.  I feel that with my level of mechanics I should be able to pub stomp fairly well as well as perform well in mid game scrim fights, however I just can’t seem to do so.  Is the answer just grinding solos during the time I would be doing playgrounds?  Is there a specific mindset or attitude I should be approaching both pubs and scrims with?  Are there specific drops that I should be grinding (hot, mid, cold)?  Any and all tips are appreciated!  Thanks in advance!

A couple of weeks ago I  decided to try to make my own mmr type ranked mode for fortnite. The  ranked mode I've made has a static amount of points for kills, a static  amount of points lost for not getting to top 35, and larger point bonus  for finishing in top 10 (winning is the equivalent to getting 15 kills).  One of the problems I personally had with winter royale was that there  was no punishment for dying or having a certain number of matches  played. A punishment for losing or dying too early is needed in an mmr  mode for fortnite so grinders stay at a rank fitting for them. Anyways  if you guys have any suggestions on how I should change this just let me  know and I'll take them into consideration.

In Dota 2/LoL/Overwatch and other esports, they are able to make a much  simpler mmr system giving out +25 to each player on the winning team and  -25 player to the losing team. However in Fortnite (Br in general),  it's less straightforward determining someone's skill, which players  better the one who died with 6 kills top 10 or the player with 1 kill  who wins. I put a lot of thought into this when trying to balance my  ranked system. In a lobby out of 100 players it is possible to gain 1932  points (990 from kills and 942 from placement) while in a match.  Gaining points from placement starts at 35th place. Anyone failing to  get higher than 35th will lose a static amount of 30 points. 36th-100th  combined loses 1950, which is as close as I could get to matching the  amount of points gained in the lobby ",FortniteCompetitive

I’ve logged a lot of hours in this game and I’ve definitely seen my skill level increase from when I first started playing, when putting up just walls with a ramp was considered building.

The problem I’m facing is I’m on console, which to be fair I see people on controller who are absolutely fantastic I’m just struggling to get there. When I see the way some controller players are able to build it baffles me but also instills the drive in me to get better and to try and be that. 

My question is when I see some of the top tier controller players play I can’t grasp how they’re able to do the builds they craft regularly. I watch tons of videos and practice the things I see them doing in both playground and actual lobbies but can’t seem to find that rhythmic flow they all have. 

Any suggestions or pointers would be very helpful. Feel free to be as critical or harsh as you want I have thick skin.

Side note: I’m not a great player I’d say I’m average maybe slightly above average but far from the cream of the crop.

376,tooCold4Ice,1543422377,a17pke,106,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a17pke/fortnite_winter_qualifier_data_analysis/,1,Fortnite Winter Qualifier Data Analysis,"I am a stats guy with some time to kill between now and the holidays, so out of sheer boredom I decided to run an analysis on all the qualifying players in the Winter Skirmish.  My goal was basically to see who was the most efficient and most consistently dominating, but a few of the numbers I found very surprising and some definitely questionable.  

First things I checked were the basics.  Points Per Match and Wins Per Match.  I personally believe Points per match is more important than wins in this type of format, but I've provided the top 10 for both below.  

(Note: the top 10 is also the only players above 4 points per match, this was coincidence)

[Sorted by Points per Match](https://i.redd.it/fxdxzbtwj3121.png)

Anyone who scored more than 2.3 points per match can be considered to have performed 'above average.' However these players performed exceptionally above average.

This list validates players like MrSavage and Fulmer who may not have been known to everyone, but definitely are known now due to their performance in the qualifiers.  They may not be the best players, but they are incredibly efficient in THIS particular format.    
However, there was a player more efficient that I haven't heard anyone discuss from EU.    
Pero0 came in 62nd place with only 30 points, but he was by a good margin the most efficient in this format.  
(Honorable shout out to TTV\_Tokyeo from NA and Waypoint Jinzen from EU who were also incredibly efficient despite placing well outside the top 100)

So I continued on to Wins Per Match, seeing if I could find any other 'sleepers' trying to take a crack at #1.  

*Processing img djtslrq1k3121...*

Again, we see Pero0 atop the list along with TTV\_Tokyeo and MrSavageM.  This stat implies each of these players are very strong in the end game and very efficient at getting the eliminations they need to get points on their way to the final circle.  If you had a choice between betting any of these 3 players to win or 'the rest' during the qulaifier, it was safer to bet on one of these three guys to be the last man standing. faultur is bald as well as Pearl show up here as well and deserve that recognition for making both lists.

FA Ares (40%) and Twitch beehive (44%) just barely fall out of the top 10.  

The ones we see fall off the list is TB Fulmer (33%), Waypoint Jinzen (29%) and Le Afek(33%). Their  winning percentage implies that they gets most of their points from eliminations, rather than by winning at endgame.  This would imply that they are slayers, and a strong contenders for having some of the most eliminations in the final rounds.  

On the other end of these stats, we have the players who were arguably the 'hot droppers.'  These players were likely dropping into the first POI, getting three kills for 1 points, leaving match, and repeating.   This is not an accusation.  The format is what the format stated and these players were either smart enough to realize the potential, or lucky and determined enough to continue playing and have these games work out this way.  

[Hot Droppers or Early Slayers](https://i.redd.it/b54s0skqj3121.png)

That being said, this method will be extremely ineffective in a format with the amount of games capped.

Just for fun to see what it looked like, I created a standard deviation curve for the qualifiers and compared it to a random curve which is a guess at what we should have expected this to look like.  This is not entirely accurate as we're only looking at the top 400 players and not the entire data set.

Hi All

This is gonna be a long post on how tired I am about the situation in competitive Fortnite, I would love some discussions about this but if you arent involved or interested in the scene please dont leave comments like ""just appreciate that you get paid to play"" -- This leads nowhere.

First of all, this post wont go into topics about patch changes at all, like discussions if re-deploy is good, if we should have moving circles etc etc. This is topics that divides both casual and pro players and is just topics of preferences, I want to go more in depth on the structure behind Epic Games competitive plan. 

Also want to point out that this isn't a post to throw individuals under the bus. The 2 front figures Loomin and Sundown is doing a really good job and is well connected to the community and the pro players, they have a position where its easy to become influenced by power and be a prick, but they are humble and hard working persons. 

I choose to be anonymous here because I want to create awareness and discussions, no personal drama. 

I've been in the scene since Fortnite started, I've been trying to play competitive as soon as it started. At first Fortnite was the funniest game ever, me and friends could grind for countless of hours and we improved and everything was good. But after a couple of month you obviously want to strive for something better, its no ranking system, no way to play with friends, no way at all to actually practice. Even this state is \_OK\_ for some time, but now we have been like this for 6-8 months and its draining everyone life essence. 

I am so amazed how a game developer can treat their competitive community like this. I understand that they have to cater to their casual audience mainly, thats where the money is, but if you look at most other games it fully supports and let their community do \_whatever\_ they want to (hi Valve, hi Blizzard). Thats even how ALL biggest game genres was made. 

CS was a mod in half life  
Dota was a mod in wc3  
Battle royale was a mod in Dayz

All these wonderful games came from full creativity and freedom from the players, just IMAGINE what Fortnite players could create in playgrounds, imagine Mario party but player made in the game.

On the same time both employees and Epic Games tweet that they love esport and competition, which annoys me a bit. 

And then communities in Europe got custom servers, A french one and Bush Paranoia. I didn't play either one because of nationality but they were very well organised and the closest fortnite up to today had to a good and serious competitive environment. And then it got removed because the rest of the world complained they got it. 

Just hear that out -- communities is doing FAIR tournaments that everyone loves, and instead of giving that feature to others in other region they remove it to make it fair. 

Why not partner up with these communities? support them? Appreciate the hard work they done to promote YOUR game, let them do what they do but monitor it so its right, everyone will be pleased. 

So Europe loses their tournaments, now Skirmishes gets announced, pros have been begging and begging for someway to practice or compete. And they make it content creators only... Totally bitchslapping all the players that spends 10-12 hours per day with a dream to compete. 

Dont get me wrong, content creator tournaments to get reach is an awesome marketing tool, we dont need to remove those, but WHY not have something for ""pros"" as well, a tournament where everyone can qualify. Now it has turned into a game where players try to ass-lick epic games employees to get a spot, thats literally how the scene works now, its 70% skill and 30% of who can write the cutest DM and comment on every status people do. 

Then we come to the Twitchcon stuff, forcing players to use a specific setup (unheard of, get your shit together please). This is NOT equal for everyone, this is not how equality works, its like asking a monkey and a fish to climb a tree and see who does it best. equal is to let people use WHATEVER they fit are best for them and then compete. Also with forcing settings. This is most likely a decision from higher ups at Epic Games that want their game to look flawless for the audience, its a more ""ok"" decision then forcing setup tho, I can understand this one a bit. 

Its so many more topics and small things I want to bring up, but I really feel this post gets to long, I might do another one with more in depth thoughts. 

Key points and solutions.

\- Please partner up with communities/discords and give them custom access for competitive players(note - competitive dosnt mean pro, it can be ANYONE who wants to compete), people at high  level NEEDS to practice to improve or else they will get bored and leave the game, peoples competitive mind needs to get pleased, its the same with everything in life. 

\- Please also support custom access to casual small events like school lans etc etc, I do speak for the competitive community here but lets not forget about all the people at home that just want to play with their homies =) 

\- Please partner up with tournament organizers like ESL, PGL etc and let them do what they do best, productions and events. 

So many snipe discord is coming up now, people LOVE the grind, but snipes is..... a joke towards the competitive community. 

And i point out once again, I love a lot of what Epic games does, please dont let this be hate thread, I am just so... not frustrated but I given up in some sense, I just want to grind grind grind.

Lastly regarding Winter skirmishes now, the idea is quite good, and will please the players for now, but they need something similiar ongoing, maybe even everyday. like a ladder or mmr system.",FortniteCompetitive

Previously, redeploy allowed you to: be mobile and rarely get stuck in the storm long, negate fall damage, swanton on a team when you get a knock, fall from heights hills without taking damage.

So now with the slower redeploy, it's harder for us to move around the map fast, and swanton onto people. BUT you still can negate fall damage, and glide down from high hills which is clutch in final circle situations. 

Maybe it is a tad too slow, but I can get epic intended to test run it like this because of people complaining about 3rd parties being so easy. I'm fine with this slow redeploy making it into permanent game modes. Is anyone else?",FortniteCompetitive

Hey guys!

So I recently created a video [(here's the link if you're interested)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZ4nmyuo3Ds&amp;feature=youtu.be) for tips/strategies that can potentially help a viewer improve at Fortnite in terms of macro/rotations/decisions/evaluating options during a game. In other words: **GAME SENSE**. In this specific episode, I focus on exactly that. Decisions you make can single-handedly decide whether you win an engagement or not.

In any given scenario in Fortnite, there's always many decisions that one can take, but usually ONE is the most ""correct""/optimal play. I'd like to think that I'm an above average Fortnite player so I want to give back to the community, encourage discussion, and explain the way that I play so people can understand the game better, and ultimately improve. **Feel free to disagree and challenge my ideas too! I'm not perfect, I can be wrong as well.**

That's the whole point of the ""Inside the Mind of Zykoma"" series, where I think out loud, so that viewers can hear my thoughts vocally, and understand the thought processes behind my decisions and the reasons for why I'm playing the way I am, with the hope that they benefit from it.

I just wanted your guys' feedback on how I can improve the series in future episodes so that I can help the viewers the most. This can be anything from criticizing the format of the video, the video length, my voice is too quiet... etc. Anything goes.

Any positive feedback is appreciated too, so that I can continue focusing on that part of the series and work hard to keep it in the series! Also, if the video ended up helping YOU guys improve your Fortnite, let me know!

Appreciate every bit of feedback I get here :) I'll be replying to every single one!

I won't reply with any hostility or salt.

I'll try to make this as succinct as possible. Epic's game design team are dismantling this game piece by piece and they don't give a fuck about you. I took a two week full hiatus to focus on studies / personal and I come back to a huge fucking list of garbage. Even with changes that I thought would be amazing like pump balancing, they manage to throw in some RNG by making epic and legendary variants that nobody asked for.

1. Redeploy flying speed is a fucking joke. I cannot believe that made it through onto live
2. FUCKING Turrets that literally make you feel like Bastion with a giant impenetrable shield
3. Dynamite 
4. Shotgun range changes AND miss reward mechanic that literally nobody asked for 
5. 0 Quality of life changes (It's like they don't even know the difference between Quality of life and a Mechanic overhaul
6. 0 bug fixes and even more bugs introduced with turrets and gliding
7. Doing EXACTLY the opposite of what the community asks for a.k.a Popup tourny
8. Spatial audio up Close quarters is still beyond dogshit.

Now I'm going to go back to not playing this game because at this point it's redundant. You want to improve in a game that literally back peddles every other week with huge changes that only 11 year olds and people with &lt;100 hours play time want? Be my guest. Pro community is a huge directional change for epic from the old Daequan/Myth/Ninja days of twitch dominance, we have real stand out players and FortniteBR is dominating social medias and twitch with competitive Fortnite and **they could care less.**

My theory is that they never could have anticipated how popular the game became, and they definitely did not anticipate such a competitive scene to develop and now they are looking for ways to reduce server stress at all costs. 
 
Let's be honest for a minute... sure some people think that ""50 players in last circle is not fun"" but that was the core game. We loved it... we made it the #1 game in the world. 
 
I think if they had paid attention to all the early signs that the game needed more performance enhancement to accommodate a growing competitive scene rather than new weekly items and cosmetics... we probably wouldn't see Epic forcing players to early game fights and reducing materials as much as they can.

The problems begin with the worst aspects of the game. The first one being glider redeploy. With the recent change, glider redeploy is slow and clunky and should really just be disabled at this point because you are basically dead if you deploy it in a fight. Not to mention accidentally redeploying it when trying to do the jump-around on a ceiling above you. 

Explosives. The best part about food fight before dynamite, was that there were no explosives at all. It felt good not having a random guy with a rocket launcher glide on a build fight (sometimes with no audio cue) and immediately explode you to death. This happens several times in one game and is one of the most annoying aspects in the game considering he can do it over and over because you will probably drop ammo for him when you die.

Shotguns. Shotgun rng is at an all time high with the green pump not being able to one hit from 100 health to the body and 200 to the head. It is pretty aggravating landing on someone doing 95 white damage and then immediately dying to someone with the new pump because he found the better gun. 100+ body shots should not be possible, nor should 200+ headshots. Neither should bad aim be rewarded by doing a minimum of 3 pellets. It seems as if the shotgun buff was to balance out the double barrel up close, but balancing should not be from the bottom up, especially in this case where pumps where already really good. 

Heavy snipers in specific. This bad boi has been busted since it came out. While it is fun to use it is not balanced at all. Comparing to other snipers, it combines the best aspects of all of them and combines it into one. It has a scope, it deals the most damage (often one hit to the body), it has low bullet drop, it has a good bullet speed, it can break any structure. And the one downside (not really) is two second reload. With other snipers you are generally not peeking every second it is reloaded and you often peeking from different angle which may take you more than two seconds to get to. So no, the reload doesn't counter the other aspects.

Other things that are not as bad but can still be reworked are the Deagle and the AK. The Deagle/pump combo can be the best combo with 200+ pumps as you have free access to a box and the chance to kill instantly. Not to mention 100 minimum headshot damage so it might as well count as a sniper. The AK is literally superior to the scoped and thermal in every way possible. Twice the damage as the scoped, just as accurate if fired at the same rate, doesn't have a scope (not having one for an AR is better), and can be fired faster for spam, and has 10x better hip fire.

I can often understand the things they do but not always agree. We need to discuss things that are wrong and provide reasoning as to why it is wrong. I've talked about this before on the regular BR sub reddit, whining and complaining can lead to bad decision making by the devs. For example turrets in this case. Community: End game turtling and tunneling is annoying and not fun to watch. Epic: Here is a turret that can put a stop to it. Turns out the turret can do more than just counter turtles, it can counter just about anything. Epic: Or what about dynamite, that can literally wipe an entire food fight base. Or how about quite literally killing the people who don't want to fight until end game. Do you see what I mean? We need to work with the devs and not have them just do stuff because things don't seem right.

With the introduction of new weapons and utility items to the game, such as balloons, the rate from which shield drops from chests and spawns with floor loot has dropped significantly. This season I have opened anywhere from 5 to 10 chests in a row, multiples times in different games, without obtaining any form of shields and often any form of heals in general. Most of the items dropped which would've been shield back in season 2, 3 or 4 are now more often then not balloons or one of the most recent additions to the game, dynamite. This is extremely frustrating as a player because even though this game is a Battle Royal which understandably is an RNG based game, shield is a necessity in Fortnite and often is the difference between winning or losing an early game encounter or a fight period. I feel there is a balance between making shield spawn rates too high versus the current state in which they are at. If Epic feels that shield drops shouldn't be touched or are fine as is, another way to fix this problem is to apply the kill incentive from the Winter Skirmish Qualifiers. This change would be beneficial for a multitude of reasons, a big one being it could save your life from being third partied as often players are left with little time to heal after a fight. It rewards players for being aggressive and increases the pace of the game which seems to be Epics goal with all of the vehicles and glider redeploy mechanics they are testing out. Overall, gaining that 50 health or shield would also help fix the lack of shield and shield RNG in the game, making the game more competitive as a whole. So my proposal is to either test out increasing shield drop rates from chest or as floor loot, decrease the rate at which other utility items spawn which would increase shield drops, or add the kill incentive from the Winter Skirmish Games. Feel free to share your thoughts on the state of shields as I'm curious how other players feel about this topic. ",FortniteCompetitive

So I’m an EU PS4 Player, id  personally say I’m a pretty good player, in a pub game I win most my build battles and usually get high kill games, generally because I drop tilted most games. After the winter Royale I ended up getting 25 points and didn’t qualify. I think my problem was when I got into 20 points and above, it became more like a scrim and I have 0 scrim experience. I have watched all the fortnite tournaments and how the pro players play scrims, so I was familiar with the way in which it should be played. However, I can’t help but think that if I had practiced in a scrim discord beforehand then I may have qualified. 

So for any competitive players, can you guys give me recommendations as to what discord i should join in order to practice scrimming. I have a goal of competing in a high level tournament one day and I just hope that the fortnite hype lasts long enough for me to get the chance. 

Thanks ✌🏽",FortniteCompetitive

(+ a suggestion to possibly make looting less RNG heavy)","In my opinion it is really dumb that you are able to pull out an RPG from your first chest. Getting a splode weapon early game gives you such a major advantage that it's nowhere near balanced. Late game I feel like they're manageable but still  very powerful utility. So just get rid of the lower rarity variants, make all splode weapons gold and make them exclusive to supply drops. This would also make supply drops way more valuable and sought after. I feel like right now people go for supply drops only if one happens to land right next to them. Perhaps after a change like this more people would go out of their way to hunt supply drops and contest people over them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus suggestion: Another thing I feel is a bit off balance at the moment is the fact that you can find a gold scar as ground loot, and at the same time you can get a grey burst out of a chest. I feel like chests should have a guarantee of at least a blue rarity weapon and ground loot should only go up to the blue rarity. Perhaps even getting rid of the grey rarity all together could be a good move. This would make the gap between the worst and the best weapons a little narrower while also making the loot pool a little smaller. This equals less RNG.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong. There still needs to be less powerful weapon and more powerful weapons but they should also follow a more consistent pattern.

Well it's back, and now it seems people prefer the combat shotgun still.

If this entire debacle isn't a wake up call into the state of the community, then I don't know what is.

Where's all the people talking about *The loot pool being dilluted*?

Where's all the people saying to *stop adding useless things into the game*?

**Crickets**

You know why? Because it was never about either of those things, or any of the other strange arguments they would make for/against a weapon begin added, changed, or removed.

It was always about **getting what they want**.

Literally three new items were added into the loot pool, each with a number of rarity variants. And yet, the complaints are practically silent.

Look, I'm happy with these additions. I think that the more options that are available, the better. Variety is the spice of life, especially in a battle royale game. It keeps things fresh and interesting. And for those who doubt my sincerity of this sentiment, you can look through my post history yourselves and see that I've been consistent on it for as long as I've been posting on here.

The devs sticking to their guns and not capitulating to these underhanded attempts at persuading them was the right call, and always will be in my opinion. This patch and the subsequent community reaction is more telling of that than ever.",FortNiteBR

Every fight I got into, there was 5 times more building. I think this is because of the pump shotgun. When two people with a combat fight, it seems like a shotgun spray fest. If someone builds for height, the other guy can low ground peek because of its range. With the pump however, it’s range makes it so you have to be closer to do a good amount of damage, so “build battles” are a lot more common. At least for me. 

Anyways, with the combat only in the game, the building in pubs seemed to decrease, and it was more of a shotgun sprayfest of jumping a round with your combat and seeing who has better aim. 

To me, the combat is just a gross gun, and I hate how good it is. Maybe it’s because it quacks when it shoots, or maybe it’s the spraying nature of the gun, but I don’t believe that it improved Fortnite. I had so much fun yesterday, actually building",FortNiteBR

*This game reminds me a lot of a game I used to play called GunZ The Duel. It was an incredibly fun game and I have not played a game as enjoyable since, until Fortnite. Fortnite has the potential to be the greatest game of all time and even in the rough state it is in right now it probably already holds that claim. I love this game and I find it really fun even though lately I have been finding it very hard to play for long sessions. Playing this game for too long now feels like doing a job and I think it is because of the current issues and imbalances festering in the game. I am not a great player. I am just a regular guy that plays on his PS4 on the families living room TV to the constant complaints and distractions of everyone telling me I play too much, or I should be doing something better with my time (even though I only play an hour or two a day). I have made it into champions league and felt great accomplishment for a time, only to have that sense of joy stripped into a lethargy about the state of the game. For some reason I felt compelled to make this write-up about the game, possibly in an effort to help save the game I love...*

*I have written this from the POV of an Epic released patch note in an attempt to lead by example or somehow fake it until we make it.*

# 1V1 and 2V2 Playlists:

* Materials will be capped at 1500 to prioritize skill as well as building efficiency.
* Infinite ammo. Fall damage on. Build with metal.
* Both ranked and casual playlists available.
* Three weapon picks from a list of standardized weapon choices in ranked mode: AR, drum gun, suppressed submachine gun, tactical shotgun, combat shotgun, pump shotgun. Players will also get 2 mini shields to allow for counterplay.
* Elo point system with 10 divisions. Five placement matches before entering your most suitable division.
* Leaderboard that shows the top 100 performers as well as a scrolling banner on the bottom of the 1v1 lobby screen that shows the current longest win streak in your division as well as in the highest division i.e., “Faze Sway is on a 13 game winning streak in division 1”, “SypherPK has just ended Faze Sway’s 13 game win streak in division 1”.
* Winning against a higher skilled player than you gives you more Elo points compared to if you won against a weaker player and vice versa.
* Relegation is possible but there is a relegation safety cushion of 100 points.
* 1v1 matches are best of 5.
* 1v1 tournaments for a chance to win prizes will take place each season.
* The match will start in the typical creative 1v1 setup with a barrier between the enemy players. The barrier will fall, and players will become invulnerable for the first 5 seconds to allow players to run past each other without surprise attacks and begin cranking 90’s or dab should they so desire.
* These are the division point breakdowns:

Div1: 2000+

Div2: 1750-2000

Div3:1500-1750

Div4:1250-1500

Div5:1000-1250

Div6:750-1000

Div7:500-750

Div8: 250- 500

Div9: 100-250

Div10: 0-100

* Each division has a reward cape with the division colors and emblem emblazoned on the back. Pickaxing an opponent will add a special division based “etch” onto your pickaxe giving you a subtle flex.

\*\*\*

# Ballers:

* The boost ability of ballers has been nerfed so that boost takes 25% longer to regenerate. Ballers will also now lose 5 health for every wall they break. This is in line with our philosophy of ensuring players do not get a free ride to end game placement points because they landed on a baller.
* Stinks will now do damage to players in ballers. Ballers and other vehicles will not be able to pick up loot by rolling/driving over it.
* A bug has been fixed where players were sometimes unable to enter ballers.
* Players are now able to immediately exit from vehicles, but we have implemented a 2 second animation to enter vehicles. This should mitigate players exiting ballers to take pot shots and hiding in their ballers again.
* A bug has been fixed where players were unable to rearrange their inventory upon entering a baller.

\*\*\*

# Building/ editing:

* Edit boxes no longer need to be fully selected but instead players have the option to “draw” a pattern that will select the corresponding edit. For example: Drawing an L anywhere on the edit display will automatically edit a lower right triangle. Drawing a straight horizontal line will edit the top row. Drawing a sideways V will edit the top 2 rows. Drawing a dot to the right of your character will edit a right window, a dot to the left will result in a left window. Drawing an upside-down U will edit an arch. These motions/swipe patterns do not need to be large or exaggerated. You also have the option to map custom edit binds by “teaching” the game A.I. what a door edit looks like by repeating the edit 20 times for the game to “learn” the motion/swipe pattern needed to create that door edit. The motion could be anything you want as long as you reproduce a similar motion enough times for the game to “learn” that THAT motion corresponds to THAT specific edit.
* You are now able to build anywhere but building over walls and other structures does not destroy structures. Instead, if editing your structure, the structure underneath will block your view until it is broken. In these cases, the original structure will take visual precedence, but should that structure be broken than your structure/wall will appear. If the overlaid structure is hollow in some areas, those areas will be filled out by your structure/wall. This will resolve the problem of instinctively building cover when getting shot only to realize building is restricted in that area and therefore taking unnecessary damage.
* **Players will now have the option to hold to edit (release to confirm edit) along with the option to one press reset (without the need to separately confirm reset).\***
* **An issue with editing where swiping over a square too fast causes the edit to not register has been fixed. Editing will now feel smooth regardless of your FPS. This issue was evident when selecting the squares and quickly confirming the edit led to a triangle edit turning into a door edit or simply not registering altogether.\***
* **Players will now be able to edit builds based on crosshair placement and not character position or the type of build that was last placed. This should fix players being unable to edit walls because they last placed a floor. This should also fix players being unable to double edit a floor and pyramid upon getting too close to the pyramid.\***
* Players are now able to build near umbrellas and reboot vans.
* Edit delay/ fatigue was accidentally introduced during season 7 and has been removed. Continuous edits should feel more seamless and fluid now.
* First piece build delay has been reverted back to 0.05.
* Players will no longer be able to place builds through another players builds. Players will no longer be able to critical hit builds through other builds.
* Builds that are clipped by a player making them “phase-able” now appear to be transparent.
* Door edits will no longer initially appear to be transparent. This was mistakenly done during our efforts to optimize end game building.
* Buildings will now completely render BEFORE players land.
* **The new trap placement system has been revamped due to extreme inconsistencies. We thank all the players that provided feedback in helping us solve these issues. The current method using default key binds required us to press ""Circle"" or ""B"" to switch to build mode, then ""Square"" or ""X"" to select traps, THEN ""Square"" or ""X"" again to PLACE the trap. This is obviously redundant and requires an extra press and usually results in people spamming place trap until the trap finally places. It doesn't help that there seems to be long delays between ""build mode"" and ""trap mode"". Instead of that traps will now be placed using just one press of ""Square"" or ""X"". So, the series of presses would be ""build mode bind"" then ""place trap bind"". There is no reason that ""trap mode"" should be its own mode that requires a separate press to activate. What about if you want to switch between traps? Simply bind a directional key or even a touchpad swipe gesture on dual shock 4's to cycle through your traps while in any mode, ""combat"" or ""build"" mode.**
* **Before sequence to place a trap: ""build mode bind"", ""select trap bind"", (""cycle through traps if needed bind can only be accessed at this stage""), then finally you can ""place trap bind"".**
* **After sequence to place a trap: ""cycle through traps whenever you want (in any mode) using touchpad swipes or another bind"", ""build mode bind"" ""place trap bind"". Simple, easy, intuitive.**
* **\*\*The crosshair is now the be-all, end-all when it comes to building, editing and placing traps.\*\*Where the crosshair points will be where the action takes place. Players will now be able to place a trap on an interior wall of their box whilst standing outside looking through a window edit.**
* **The main thing to note here is that players do not need an outline template of a trap in much the same way that they did not need an outline template of any other form of build. Hence, we released the ""build immediately"" feature. For consistency, the same treatment has been given to traps and they are now treated as a ""fifth build"" instead of a completely separate mode that requires a sluggishly intermediate key press to activate. A setting has also been added that allows players to toggle off building walls and floors with traps.\***
* Controller players now have the option to swap guns using key press binds that they can set. The default key press binds on PS4 are: R1 = first slot, L1 = second slot, R1, R1 = third slot, L1, L1 = fourth slot, L1 + R1 = fifth slot

\*\*\*

# Competitive:

* Players in a queue that extends past the tournament deadline are now guaranteed to join a match so long as they remain in queue. A “last call” notification will be implemented where all players attempting to queue into one last match are reminded within 5 minutes from tournament end to join a queue.
* Arena Trios will be implemented into the game BEFORE the trio tournament in order to allow players to practice and prepare for the trio tournament.

# Game:

* We are testing ways to minimize early game RNG and improve competitive integrity. Players will now spawn with a grey pistol BUT players will also be granted invulnerability while jumping from the bus until they reach the ground.
* **Players are now able to hold to place builds before entering build mode whereas before it would only work with walls.\***
* **Controller players are now able to overlap presses. for example: players are now able to hold down the ramp button and tap the wall button to place a protective wall hanging from the end of each ramp, whereas before a player would need to tap ramp, let go of ramp, tap wall, tap ramp, etc.. This way, the action of releasing the ramp bind automatically places a wall since you were holding the wall bind down the entire time.\***
* Arena will now follow the same Elo system as the 1V1 and 2V2 playlist. There will be divisional rewards as well as a weekly leaderboard. In order to mitigate queue times, players will spawn in a pregame creative lobby where they will be able to split up and vote on competitive minigames to play while they wait. Ex: 32 person king of the castle in old Tilted Towers, 4v4 Mini BR, 16 player zone wars etc..
* Controller players will no longer be able to “L2 spam”. The ADS sequence will now ADS perfectly in the centre of the crosshair. This will mitigate L2 abuse where players with high FPS will “lock on” to enemy players.
* The grenade throw animation has been adjusted so that it ceases upon the grenade leaving your hand.
* Following our philosophy of allowing the players to see what is on their screen, we will no longer show game messages (storm closing, reboot card reminders etc...) in the middle of the screen but instead small graphics and short audio queues will replace them.
* **Players now have the option to turn off pre-edits.\***
* Players are now able to build over all parts of Loot Lake.
* Players are now able to shoot through and glide through tree leaves (no hitbox). Although landing in a tree “breaks your fall” and you take 50% of the fall damage that you would have taken otherwise. The hitbox of the actual tree (excluding leaves) has been reduced so that it just barely clips the interior wall of the branches and trunk.
* Edge camping a cornfield no longer grants vision to a player and players on the outside are now able to see players camping the edge of a cornfield.
* Respawn vans have been removed from all solo game modes.
* A free wall will now be placed atop the wall in the ground if the grounded wall is at least 50% (190 cm) BELOW the surface (previously 70%). The purpose of this fix was to ensure players did not take unnecessary damage due to walls being placed in the ground. Since the average Fortnite character is 185 cm and the height of a wall is 380 cm, we have found that walls should extend out of the ground at least 185 cm to ensure a character is fully protected.
* Rarity now represents both the rarity of the item in terms of spawn rate and the viability of the item/weapon in terms of effectiveness. Statistical studies have been done that may be counterintuitive to popular belief that indicate RNG is minimized when items on the low AND high end of the spectrum (in terms of strength and viability in the current meta) have LOWER spawn rates than average strength items/weapons.
* Trap damage has been reduced to 100 damage. We initially reduced trap damage to 75 in season 4 because we had data that revealed traps were too strong at 125 damage. After weeks of testing we realized traps were not viable at 75 damage and so we increased their damage to 150 completely forgetting the laws of transitivity. Because of this trap damage has been reduced to 100.
* Stink damage is no longer stackable. If a player throws multiple stinks the damage from both stinks will not overlap anymore. Areas where multiple stinks overlap will still do 5 damage per second. Stinks will now skip the first tick of damage to allow players time to react.
* **A pickaxe delay was introduced in season 4 to stop fast farming techniques. This delay did not work to prevent fast farming as players just found workarounds. Because of this we have chosen to remove the pickaxe delay in order to increase gameplay fluidity.\***
* Gun reload animations are now a tiny smidge longer than actual reload times. This will help prevent players from mistiming the reload and thinking their gun is ready to shoot. The number of bullets in your clip now appears in the top left corner of the weapon graphic to help players know if they need to reload any weapons.
* Ping-based matchmaking will be tested in an effort to diminish ping advantages within the game. During matchmaking lower ping players will be prioritized resulting in players with similar pings to be matched together.
* **Settings for console like shadows, textures, effects, view distance etc.. are now available in the settings.\***
* Separate build/ edit sensitivities for PC are now available in the settings to maintain consistency between platforms.
* Cross-platform lobbies now show the logo of the console/ PC along with a logo of either controller or Kb/M next to the players name.
* Players are now able to adjust different settings for custom lobbies including, storm surge, siphon, material caps, and farm rates.
* Players will no longer hitch/teleport straight to the ground after being shot down, but instead will fall in a smooth motion consistent with gravity and the laws of physics.
* Riding a zipline will no longer destroy builds in the path of the zipliner. The player will now be thrown off the zipline upon crashing into structures.
* Fully breaking trees will now grant bonus material equivalent to two additional critical hits.
* **The shield damage effect has been reverted due to players not being able to see the majority of the screen after getting shot. Shotgun particles and material break particles have also been minimized to improve visibility during box fights and other close-range engagements. From now on we will prioritize visibility over wall-break, shrapnel, shield, health and damage number related animations.\***
* Upon hearing complaints from many players experiencing motion sickness due to the default FOV, we have decided to add an FOV slider ranging from 90 – 110. This will allow players to find their optimal setting.
* A bug has been fixed where players spawn into a match with broken skin textures.
* Players will no longer be able to clog the kill feed by spamming spectate.
* There is no longer a discrepancy between crouch delay/responsiveness when repair is also bound to the same crouch button. There is also no longer a delay upon picking up items when hold to swap is on. This was caused by the “release to pick up” feature being applied to all instances of picking up items, not just hold to swap items.
* A bug has been fixed where sometimes using a shadow bomb leaves the player visible to other players and disables the ability to switch weapons or go into build mode.
* A bug has been fixed where redeploy is cancelled if a player reloads before attempting to redeploy.
* Players will now be able to automatically assign weapon slots so that a weapon is automatically placed in a predetermined slot based on your preference. This will minimize opening your inventory to rearrange weapons. Instead of hold to swap, players have the option to double tap a weapon/item to swap it.
* Chests now drop one weapon with an extra clip of its corresponding ammo, one non-weapon item and one healing item. Players also have the option to 5-hit farm unopened chests to obtain 50 wood and 50 metal. Since chests are guaranteed to spawn now, we will be actively looking to balance and possibly nerf the amount of chest/floor spawns.
* The reboot card popup will now disappear when looking at it, but the blue indicator pillar will remain the same to help locate the reboot van.

\*\*\*

# Audio:

* **HRTF audio is now released to help pinpoint in game sounds.\***
* **Audio sliders have also been implemented to allow for further fine-tuning audio such as weapon sounds, footsteps, glider sounds, structure break sounds, pickaxe sounds, environmental sounds, building sounds, character falling sounds, and emote sounds. These sliders allow for a maximum volume increase/ decrease of 50%.\***
* An audio bug has been fixed where players standing on objects in a building sounded as though they were on a higher floor.

Loot pool: Coming soon...

\*\*\*

# Creative:

* **Custom crosshairs are now supported for all game modes. A crosshair creator map has been added to the creative island much like CSGO’s crosshair selection area where players will be able to shoot to select different crosshair pre-sets.\***
* A bug has been fixed which caused the wind sound effect to continually play in creative mode.
* **A bug has been fixed where players would get an unknown error upon trying to join a creative game in progress.**
* **A bug has been fixed where players joining a playground or creative game would freeze after a few minutes.\***

\*\*\*

# Healing:

* “Ooze juice” is dropped in stacks of 2 upon killing an enemy. They grant 25 base health or shield health (5 health per second). They can only be used when the first ooze juice completes its healing cycle. This has the potential to grant you and/or your team mates (if they are also splashed) 50 health over a span of 10 seconds minimum. Taking damage ceases the health regeneration effect.
* Chug jugs now give continuous health up to a maximum of 200. Players will be able to “chug”, gaining 10 health per second, and save the rest for later or share with a friend. We believe this healing buff better represents the legendary rarity of the item.
* Players with a bush equipped are now able to get health from chug splashes.
* Chug splashes now auto sort to the right if the player has auto-sort consumables to the right turned on.

\*\*\*

# Bug Fixes:

* A bug has been fixed where controller sensitivity was inconsistent between games.
* Players will no longer be able to shoot another player through a structure or door if a player or gun is clipping through the wall.
* A bug has been fixed where players were given the option to redeploy every time they jumped.
* A bug has been fixed that did not allow players to pick up items that were clustered near each other.
* A visual bug has been fixed where a “purchase” option was shown upon attempting to exit from the game.
* A visual bug has been fixed that caused the “add friends” menu screen to reappear even after selecting the “never show again” option.
* **A bug has been fixed where if custom binds are used on controller where you confirm edits with a different bind and go to build, you will not be able to build straight away as opposed to having default binds where you are able to build instantly.\***
* **A controller bug has been fixed where the game memory of the last weapon that was used is “lost” on controller upon switching from your pickaxe to your builds.\***
* **A controller bug has been fixed that occurred upon cancelling an edit where your previously held weapon switches to another weapon.\***
* A bug has been fixed where sometimes your teammate spectating you is able to see fall damage indicators of enemy players across the map.
* A texture bug has been fixed which sometimes caused traps to be invisible when placed in certain areas such as Tomato Temple.
* A visual glitch has been patched where players would sometimes get stuck inside their builds.
* Slow glider redeploy has been fixed. Players will now glide at normal speeds using glider redeploy.
* A visual bug has been fixed where flints and other single ammo clip weapons didn’t automatically reload.
* A bug has been fixed where your gun sometimes doesn’t shoot when “quickscoping”. This issue is mostly prevalent with the heavy sniper and tac shotgun. *We like to highlight all aspects of our game and so we ensured this bug would be put on full display when Tfue was unable to fire his heavy sniper three times in a row during a qualifying game for the world cup.*
* **A bug has been fixed where traps did not place on console upon holding down the “trap place” button.\***
* A bug has been fixed where traps appeared to be enemy traps after being fully built.
* A bug has been fixed where mouse and keyboard binds appeared for controller player on PC, making it so the player is unable to turbo build. This was put on full display when the glitch happened to Aydan during the Pro Am.
* A bug has been fixed where players were unable to pick up items when standing directly over top of them.
* **Two visual bugs have been fixed that have been in the game since season 1.\***

1. **Bullet trails sometimes caused an optical illusion causing players to think bullets were flying from the opposite direction.**
2. **A bullet shot from the left could potentially cause a shield break effect on the players right causing further confusion as to which direction the bullet came from.**

* A visual bug has been patched that sometimes caused the blue shield damage orb to remain on screen for the remainder of the match.
* A bug has been fixed that caused players to appear as default skins even though they were wearing different skins.
* A bug has been fixed that caused the grenade explosion animation to infinitely loop upon exploding underneath a landing supply drop.
* A visual glitch has been fixed that caused some trees to turn light green upon pickaxing them.
* A bug has been fixed that allowed players in shadow mode to fire their weapons even though the shadow animation had not completely worn off.
* A visual bug has been patched that caused certain pickaxes to cause FPS drops upon wielding.

\*\*\*

# Survey:

In an effort to improve the game we have attached a small survey for all players that read the patch notes:

Would players like it if we implemented a small indicator such as a red X in the corner of the weapon graphic to show that a weapon has an empty clip?

Let’s talk about endgame optimization! Would these changes be something the community would like to test?

\- Storm damaging structures.

\- Structures from two circles ago being destroyed.

\- Different shaped storms that slowly move around organically.

\- Drone spawner that can summon your teammate next to you (5 second power up time).

\- We would love to hear community feedback on implementations or game additions that could balance the strength of low-ping wall taking techniques!

Here are a few community suggestions we may test:

* A freeze trap that could be placed in the centre of ones builds. Should an enemy steal your wall the freeze trap will activate, “freezing” the wall for 5 seconds which in turn freezes the enemy’s feet for that duration causing them to slide around. During this time the wall cannot be destroyed or edited.
* Cornstalk trap. You place the trap in your builds. The moment your builds are taken, and an enemy edit is made the trap activates. It spawns corn stalks throughout the entire interior of your builds that cannot be shot through also obscuring your enemies’ vision.
* Blueprint telemetry. A trap that allows your builds to regenerate 50 health/ second to all owned structures within 1 space away for 5 seconds.
* Turbo build overheat. Turbo building 5 consecutive structures causes your blueprints to catch fire and deal 2 damage/ second.
* If the stolen wall is connected to at least 5 other builds that belong to you: the wall will flash red for 0.5 seconds indicating that this wall will belong to both parties meaning both parties can edit it.

*Ping-based matchmaking has been chosen to test in an effort to diminish ping advantages within the game. During matchmaking lower ping players will be prioritized resulting in players with similar pings to be matched together.*

\*\*\*

As a controller player, the controller bugs are what I find to be the biggest nuisance. I have placed an asterisk and bolded the issues that literally haunt my sleep. Placing traps in this game is the bane of my existence. A well made 1v1, 2v2 playlist would catapult this game to new heights.

I realize that these suggestions may not appeal to everyone. Let's have a dialogue!

**I am also working on a way to measure weapon balance within weapon classes. I have all the data laid out and now I just need to put it in good form. It was a pleasant surprise to find that parts of the latest patch were actually consistent with the suggestions I would have made when it comes to weapon balance according to the data I collected.**",FortNiteBR

[https://dotesports.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-season-eight-overtime-challenges](https://dotesports.com/fortnite/news/fortnite-season-eight-overtime-challenges)

Looking  at 2 past seasons we can see that all the skins that got additional  styles in overtime challenges had no additional styles beforehand,  except for master key who had 1 style at tier 99.

This season features 7 new skins: Rox, Sentinel, Bunker Jonesy, Vega, Stratus, Demi and Vendetta.

Rox, Vega and Vendetta are not going to get any new styles as they already have multiple styles available.

So we have 4 skins left - Sentinel, Bunker Jonesy, Stratus and Demi.

Demi  and Stratus will get a new style for sure. Demi will probably get black  clothes instead red (would be awesome) and Stratus will get some  different colour instead of purple too.

And  either Bunker Jonesy or Sentinel gets the last style. My bet is that it  is gonna be Sentinel because he gets additional style in tier 99 and  Master Key that got style in tier 99 last season also got a style from  OT challenges moreover, bunker jonesy is perfect and adding a new style  would make it worse.",FortNiteBR

Like seriously, why are you even playing this game if you only enjoy one LTM that was never guaranteed to be permanent?


Did you ever think that maybe some people like me enjoy more LTMs instead of just the usual one since Rumble is always taking up a spot? I get that it's a lot of people's desired way of playing, but christ you don't see anyone crying their asses off when modes like Getaway or Wick's Bounty go away, and yeah I know Rumble has been around for quite some time now, but y'all are treating it as if they replaced Solos when Rumble to this day is marketed as ""Limited!""


Another thing, the whole argument of ""oh well it's easy to get challenges and Fortbytes done"" is quite stupid. Yes, I'll concede that it's easiest to do elimination challenges in Rumble; aside from that, not really any challenge is easier in rumble than it is in core modes. Fortbytes are the same way, as it doesn't take more than maybe five minutes of your time to collect a Fortbyte even after dying once or twice. The storm closes so fast in Team Rumble that you really are better off doing challenges in core modes (such as the one's that are scattered around the map for example).


TLDR: You don't **need* Team Rumble to do challenges and Fortbytes, and it's been taking up an LTM slot for far too long.


With that, let the downvotes pour in.",FortNiteBR

Had 3-4 people at one point all firing at me with it and there was just no counter. If they're in different directions you just can't build quick enough to cover the angles before they get shot down and also there's pretty much no way to kill any of them because once you're out of build mode you've got like 1 second of taking damage before you're dead.

Now yesterday i wanted to play some regular games with a ps4 friend of me, he never scrimmed so he doesn't know what to do, ofcourse he could practice on it but he doesn't play that much after all.

When we played, i had atleast 10 games that looked like scrim lobbies. Now i'm not really talking about the player count last circle , i'm actually talking more about the playstyle.

Everyone in these game were in ballers, hiding in towers, tunneling, boxing themselves in untill the zone moves, etc,...

This is not really a problem for me, but some people just want to play some normal games and not scrim lobbies.

I noticed this started to change since the arena playlist came out too.

(I wasn’t someone complaining that it got vaulted to begin with and I actually took a liking to the Combat very quickly) But I feel like with the reintroduction of the Pump, maybe the Combat should be vaulted because the fire rate is far superior to the Pump and Tac shotguns, and it overall makes for a slightly unbalanced shotgun meta because those using the Combat are 9/10 times not going to be punished for missing shots because the fire rate is so insane.

I think maybe the Heavy should be unvaulted (if the Combat is vaulted) in order to provide a shotgun with a little more range than the Tac and Pump, but not the same range or fire rate of the Combat. I just think it would make for a much more balanced shotgun meta and inject even more life back into this game.

The thing we need removed most in the game are tryhards, and u might be thinking that I’m insane well let me explain...

A lot of players queue up for standard solo duos and squads and it’s just not fun because 90% of the time your lobby will be filled with players who are bored of arena mode and come in to destroy bots like me and it’s just not fun so i suggest that these few things should be put in standard game modes 

500 mat cap 
All weapons unvaulted except boom bow, zapratron proximity gernade launcher
Faster circle (by a 33% increase)
Increased drops for splodes  (about 2.5%)
All vehicles are in
(All these changes should be implemented into standard game modes not arena modes)

Reasoning: a lot of players only play for about 1 hour a day and having these fast paced and fun changes can make the game a lot more fun for the casual demographic and would be a fun place for competitive players to chill and have fun the splode change should be there so it gives bots a fighting chance against tryhards  but still allows competitive players to win the majority of the time with all the unvaults

First off, the Pump is back. What can I say? Highlight of the patch. We all know what the pump is to the game, and seeing it come back is so good and makes me happy. 
Another one of my favorite guns, the Silenced SMG, is back, I love it so much. Such a good gun.
No problem with it, I haven't seen anyone complain about it. .
I never got to try the Revolver before, since it got vaulted before I started playing, so it's a first time experience, but I already love it. Again, another good pair with the pump.
I don't have much to say about Shockwave Grenades since I never use them, but I know some people that use them so smartly and it's cool I guess.

The only sad thing about the update is that we lost the Rift-To-Go (big F), but I guess after 4 seasons it had... To-Go. (kill me for that joke). Nothing wrong with it but I guess that vault is related to the storyline, just like the cannons. They don't fit in this season I guess.
Llamas got a very good buff and the Drum Gun got nerfed (I didn't hate it but that'll sure make all the people complaining about it shut up).

And obviously the new event and challenges. The first challenge has brought us one of the best free items in a while, the Deep End emote, and that hypes me to unlock the rest of the items that are coming. 

Overall a very good patch, nothing wrong and controversial (but why you gotta take the rifts like that) and I love it. Thanks Epic.",FortNiteBR

It also makes you have to gameplan more and think ahead, you’d have to make more decisions and strategize with your team against enemy teams. With all of these new unvaulted weapons I’ve carried less heals and such which leads to another teammate running a loadout with more heals. Unvaulting is truly great.

For those who may or may not be aware, the FortniteBR sub-reddit launched their own special monthly membership. I purchased the badges during the pre-sale and was given a month of FortniteBR membership with the option to gift (1) person a free month of membership as well. The subscription service was recently launched with several customization options being added all the time. It isn't required by any means and doesn't allow any special treatment when it pertains to rules in the sub-reddit. A few things the subscription service includes is: -'Loyalty Badge' - which displays how long you've been a supporting member. - '8 new Style Badges' - per month that you can use while your Membership is active. - 'Animated emojis' in comments - Currently available through the web browser at the moment but a mobile version will be released in the future.

Future additional perks will include: Reaction GIFs in comments, Achievement Badges, and a special Members Lounge.

If anyone is interested in trying out the subscription service then feel free to comment down below. I will randomly select and gift one person the membership. I will wait approximately 24 hours before doing so.

Today Team Rumble finally got replaced again with a new large team mode: ""Tag!"". This is the most fun I've had in Fortnite: BR in a long time.

But put the goal back to 100 elims to win. Having it at 150 is great when you have 20v20 but most matches have more than 50% of the lobby gone after a few minutes.

1) Planes can't destroy structures...

2)...but people in a slipstream can?

3) A submachine-esk gun (Tommy) uses AR ammo, while an Assault Rifle (Tactical) uses SMG ammo.

4) A Humanoid banana is able to keep its life force together even when blended into a smoothie.

5) A gigantic monster is half active on the map, and has left less than ten footprints? (How is it so sneaky when it wants to be?)

I'm not necessarily complaining, but I find most of these points funny. Any comment, anyone?",FortNiteBR

As time went on and people got better with the new shotgun (and it got some much needed bug fixes), I started to like the new shotgun. Shotgun fights felt more skilled, no more getting one shot, but who can hit the most shots the fastest. I honestly started to enjoy this new meta.

If the pump was brought back a few weeks ago, I’m sure I would of been happy. I really hope the new shotgun stays in meta",FortNiteBR

The pressure plant has been decomissioned, and the  plant will continue to be monitored. The huge lids are to contain the volcano, pressure, etc, BUT we all know that the volcano is unstable. Take for note, the Pressure Plant before had exposed lava, heat, and more factors which cause high pressure. The lid will eventually have to blow up and make the surroundings a waste land. The big dam will explode as well, spewing lava, making rivers flow around the map. There are three ways that it could end;
A cleanup procedure by the government,
The volcano being completely filled in until it doesn't exist,
Or the map being abandoned.

The outcome is yet to be seen/theorized.",FortNiteBR

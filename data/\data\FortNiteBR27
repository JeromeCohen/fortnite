Ran into one earlier who got high ground on me with ramp/wall/floor so quickly my head spun. Then he just jumped down to where I was to have a bloom fight and hit me once. 

I see the same thing when watching streamers where someone gives them a really tough build battle but as soon as the streamer gets that one edit or break-through where it turns into a gun fight, the opponent whiffs every shot like he's never played a shooting game before

I'm really curious as to why people think there seems to be so many people who who are so good at one aspect of the game but terrible at the others",FortNiteBR

It feels like you can actually fight someone trying to break into your box with drum gun spam because you can out aim them in CQC with the tac shotgun and/or actually get out and be able to build fight them, because they can't just scroll wheel down and one pump you because they live in Pennsylvania. Now i'm not saying i don't miss the pump because i DO.

I’ve really only found 2 ways to actually use the combat without taking a great deal of damage. 


1: Find someone who’s either really bad, AFK, or reviving. Only times I’ve gotten kills is when someone is in one of those 3 situations. 

2: Be an absolute god at editing and aiming. In creative and in regular playlists, the only times I’ve been killed/killed somebody using the combat is by doing multiple lightning fast edits, hitting a clean shot, editing again in a millisecond, and then hitting them again. Or, if you’re lucky, they’re really low and you can land a nice 125 and hope for the best. 

I know this sub hates criticizing epic and all that but this is just something I noticed. If it’s it to allow casuals to have more fun why make it so hard to  hit shots? 

Like you guys say, “the new shotgun isn’t bad you just can’t aim/you’re bad”. Well wasn’t this shotgun for casuals who don’t want to get one pumped? Why does it require great aim/fast edits?  


TL;DR: The new shotgun was brought in to end one pumps and make the game more enjoyable for casuals, yet it takes really good aim and editing skills to eliminate 1 person without needing 2 big pots and a med kit to recover from. 


Go ahead and downvote if you really hate what I have to say, just thought of this and wanted to share it with the sub and see what they thought.",FortNiteBR

Look i have been complaining about this game ever since the Removal of Stretched, i'm soooooooo tired of trying to suggest things or provide my input on how the game can get better, because epic just does the opposite of whatever i think would be good (Instead of reducing body damage to pumps, they just vaulted them. Instead of bringing back hop rocks and rift spawns and shadow stones, they put in some dyson tubes that let you literally rotate across the map infinitely)

I have really tried to look at this game in a different light, and have tried to just be thankful for the fact that epic trys to make the game feel new every update, but it's just not working anymore

This game just isn't appealing to me anymore, i used to be able to hate on the game, get off for a couple hours, hop back on and then fall in love again, but that hasn't happened in this season, i find myself trying to hop on and give the game another chance, but the meta just shits on me by ruining my innocent double shotgun setup with some guy who w keys me with a drum gun and stinks

I'm always getting either spammed or third-parited, and the only fights i can get into now are either Third Party kills or W keying 50/50 fights where i'm holding a Deagle, Combat Shotgun, and AR while my opponent is holding two or three SMGs and no other weapons, it's making all of the fights that i get into feel very bland and unentertaining, i don't even care when i lose health because i know that i'll have lost that health anyway due to a third-party, so i'll just let myself be at low damage and have someone push me since that's the only way that i can get into a fight without third partying

this meta is truly pulling away at my interest, this game isn't the game that i heard about from over 15 Months ago, this isn't the game that i enjoyed so much that i, a 17 year-old, spent $230 on, this isn't the game that makes me come back and love it unconditionally, this is a game that is doing what it can to keep itself at #1, and it feels like epic is just cutting people out that aren't in the majority, even though we've already contributed our part (in money and in spirit) to keeping this game enjoyable

i don't even want any tips for other games, i just want to learn how to enjoy myself in this game and not rage at all of the downsides, and how to not feel demoralized when i get destroyed by a gun that was already deemed unbalanced and overpowered a year ago",FortNiteBR

For example let's say a normal pickaxes swing is still 20 damage. But if they were to add a left click attack that's does 50 to 100 damage. This would need to have something similar to the shotgun delay so that it cannot be used too quickly after switching weapons.

Example... you are getting spammed and they w key into your box. Whip out the pickaxes and just clap them.

\-Slipstreams need to be vaulted after Season 9 (it is a big staple of Season 9 so it would be a waste to vault it right now)

\-Eliminate automatic death zones (Take a couple weeks and just WORK OUT THE BUGS IN THIS GAME, it's needed as updates are far more focused on new content rather than fixing what is wrong with the game)

\-Deactivate Ballers after the third circle in Arena and Competitive Modes (people should not be rewarded for just rolling around in Ballers the entire game)

\-Vault the Combat Shotgun (it's honestly just a tac shotgun with a faster fire rate and less damage per shot, and does not have a place in the game)

\-Lower the fire rate on the Drum Gun and increase it's rarity (they are very OP and it would provide some balance with the silenced SMG)

\-Unvault Grapplers (they were very balanced and would be viable items to have in the endgame of casual and competitive modes)

\-Take the time to improve the smoothness and consistency of editing (especially with pyramids considering how widely used they are now)

\-Vault the Silenced Bolt-Action Sniper and unvault the regular Bolt-Action Sniper (just for nostalgia, and who really needs a silencer on a sniper anyways?)

\-Reduce the likelihood of final circles being near mountains in Competitive (it happens too frequently at the moment)

\-Allow players to deactivate shadow bombs while in the state (Players should be allowed to deactivate if they are stuck in a build and need to get out before the circle comes)

So the Combat Shotgun was their way of fixing that (and the fact that over 26% of kills were from shotguns). But the Combat Shotgun just isn't good enough to really feel like a viable shotgun. The gun takes really precise accuracy to get good damage, and it's not even consistent. I saw a video of Daequan shooting Philly in the head twice. First shot he got over 100, and without moving the next shot did 37.... wtf Epic. I mean, running 2 Drum Guns is a better option than using the Combat Shotgun. And as far as the Tac goes, it's still pretty shit. The reticle is waaaay too big. Shooting a player that isn't in the same box as you will get you about 30-50 damage a shot typically. I believe, the best thing epic could've done was to rebalance the Pump Shotgun to not be able to one pump people at max HP. Maybe reduce the headshot multiplier, so you could still get decent damage if you hit body, but the max damage is capped at a certain point. What do you guys think???",FortNiteBR

-	Polar Peak usually has at least one Shadow Bomb stack. I say usually because I've found it there more often than anywhere else but have still had games without.
-	Usually one or two others will drop Polar Peak as well so you have potential targets
-	Get a tac or combat shotgun, place it/them on either side of the shadow Bomb, find someone at a lower level and be sneaky. Use a shadow Bomb then get near them, then as soon as the effect drophttps://i.imgur.com/Epe5lYQ.jpgs move to one of the close range weapons on either side and lay into them.

Like absolutely love it. I've never been so addicted to a video game and strived to be a better player. Through all the changes epic has made, I've always been there to go with the flow, even if they aren't always the greatest. I've been playing since season 1, grinded battle passes to reach tier 100 and spent hundreds of dollars.

But the most recent change may make me stop playing this game entirely. It's made the game no fun whatsoever. I'm not talking about the battle pass or map changes because I think those are great (although sliptreams can be a little annoying). But the removal of the pump shotgun may be the straw that broke the camel's back.

Epic claims they took it away because it was being used more than any other weapon to eliminate players, which may be true. But it by no means was a broken weapon, it was well balanced and rewarded accuracy. Building and being able to one pump someone was the most fun part about the game. It's the game Epic created. Now all it has become is spray and pray with all of these weapons. Kills don't even feel that satisfying anymore and it's made the game pretty boring IMO.

I'm sure some people love the new update and others hate it just as much as I do. Like I said I've been through all the changes good and bad and this is by far the worst. Here's to hoping Epic comes to their senses and brings back the game that we all love.",FortNiteBR

Some times you could be building or just running or even fighting and boom you're dead. it's so dumb that there not many ways to stop people from doing this  All you can really do is jump and hope the guy misses so you have time to react and find the player. It's the worst form of third partying and is just op. Now I know what your going to say 'but it takes skill to use it' and to that I would like to say you are correct but I can't most purple and gold sniper can one shot body shot so you don't even need to aim for the head so the skill it takes to use is lowered. But the hunting rifle is a skill weapon with it only having one shoots on heads and without a scope is harder to aim but it gets pushed aside for the op heavy.

While at a glance this does seem a bit absurd that one weapon is so heavily depended on in the game, all it takes is the application of some basic logic to discover why this is the case, and why, if the pump is gone, it will simply be replaced by the next best close quarter gun. In fact, I’m willing to be that the drum gun will EXCEED the 26% kill rate that the pump had, and I will provide a detailed analysis and argument for why I believe this. 

Due to the nature of fortnite battle royal, there are a plethora of reasons why the pump was a favourite weapon, especially amongst more skilled players. In a battle royale game which is RNG, players will naturally gravitate towards strategies that eliminate randomness as much as possible, allowing them to take less damage and secure kills due to skill and strategy. This just makes sense as you can finish fights quicker meaning less heals used, less third party potential, more time to rotate, etc. At all stages of the game, the vast majority of combat is finished at close range.

Early game fights are almost all CQC because they often happen indoors. So guess what, people learned to do things like right-hand peak corners and hit headshots with the pump in order to minimize the damage they take. 

Midgame fights almost always end up turning into CQC as you inevitably hone in on your opponent after dealing damage, or because your AR bloom isn’t working out that day and you want a guarantee that your shots will land. Think about how many engagements you actually finish from a distance - probably much lower than the amount you finish close up. 

Endgame is almost always CQC because the circle gets small and personal forcing you to be in close proximity to your opponents. 

The existence of bloom is also essential for the reality that CQC is meta in fortnite. Bloom means that when I’m shooting someone with and AR, my aim could be perfect and I still miss my shots, while their aim is off and they can hit theirs. The result of this is good players gravitating towards higher skill cap weapons in order to deal large amounts of burst damage and simultaneously protect themselves. The pump is the one weapon that has proven most valuable (especially to more skilled players) because of the ability to completely eliminate RNG while using it. Outbuilding and out-aiming your opponent was the one reliable strategy players could use to confidently kill opponents without taking much damage. And when facing another opponent of similar skill level who can also aim and build well, you’ve got yourself a challenge that gets the heart pumping and drives you to improve or keep playing. This right here is exactly what many of us are addicted to. 

The relationship between the pump and building has existed since the very beginning of this game and has been entrenched into the muscle memory and playstyle of pretty much every somewhat dedicated player. Due to this, vaulting the pump is actually a drastic change almost rivaling the changing of a core game mechanic. It completely changes the play of the game. 

Other than the CQC aspect there are other reasons that the pump accounts for so many kills. One reason is that its a great finisher weapon. Pretty much any time you know that someone is low on health, you’re gonna try to hit them with a pump. Even if you miss some pellets you’ll probably still kill them if they’re at 30 hp. Whenever you’re playing duos or squads and your buddy calls out “hes one shot”, odds are you’re probably taking out your shotgun to finish him off. How many times have you sniped or lasered someone with AR only to rush in and finish with the pump? It just makes sense. A more balanced analysis would have been to measure the damage done between all weapons, not just the number of kills. 

Now that the pump is gone, there isn’t going to be a magic restoration of balance between the tac, combat, smgs and other classes of weapons. Instead players are just going switch from the pump to the gun that is most reliable. u/whatacohencidence has shown us that the drum gun outperforms both shotguns currently in the game, effectively dealing 200 damage faster than any other weapon. Here’s the link to his post with that analysis. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bn6e6w/after_lots_of_testing_the_new_combat_shotgun_and/

Take a look at any pro player or streamer’s loadout and I can guarantee they will be carrying at LEAST one drum gun. Yesterday I played the whole day and I can confidently say that 80-90% of my kills were obtained with the drum gun. I didn’t use tac or combat all day, my preferred loadout was deagle and two drum guns. For the first time in my life I won multiple games without even touching a shotgun. With the pump gone and the other shotguns being irrelevant, the drum gun is just going to replace the spot of the pump for being responsible for the highest percentage of kills. In fact I believe that it could easily exceed the pump’s 26% due to the ease of use and accessibility of anyone to the weapon. With the pump at least you had to hit your shots, a bad aim player would not secure pump kills as often. However with the drum gun all you have to do is spam and you can get pretty easy kills. 

TL:DR - Whether its early, mid or late game, close quarter combat dominates Fortnite. Weapons like the pump allow for players to reduce RNG and outplay opponents quickly while taking less damage. Now that the pump is gone, the drum gun will just take its place as the next best option and will easily account for over 26% of kills in Fortnite.",FortNiteBR

Also, they get in  the way of fights. lastly, I just want to say the game was in one of its best places end of season 8. Every gun was balanced and fun, and there weren't stupid slipstreams everywhere, so you could actually fight without the opponent dipping in the middle of a fight.

People complaining doesnt make the game worse. Complaining is the direct consequence of the game being brought into a bad state by the devs. This is the case with any company. If apple started making phones that exploded then people would complain and give apple flak for doing so. Its not the customers fault, its the companys fault. Stop thinking that people complain just to complain. They complain because there are serious issues to be discussed and the longer these issues are being ignored by epic, the more people are gonna complain.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, this whole sub gives flak to competitive players for, apparently, not having an opinion and just mindlessly consuming pro players opinions. This is especially gotten ""popular"" because of that ninja video. However theres a problem with that.

Its hypocritical. A big majority of this sub has no opinion and just mindlessly agrees with ninja and realistically any other ""anti-complain"" streamer, without ever considering why people are complaining about the games current state.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, Complaining about the game without a reason is bad and that is something I will agree on.

A lot of it for good reason, but I think we should think about how much fun the game can be because of the constant changes that are implemented. (no I don't support the drum gun)

 Everyone is hating on how the pump got vaulted, but its true to the fact that after the pump buff, it was either you have shotgun aim or you die. Now this promotes an attitude of not just trying to close the distance in a fight and blow somebody's head off, but offers a more tactical approach. (pun intended on the shottie).

 I can understand that most people don't like change, and that's where a lot of hate comes from, but unless you're a pro player, I think the game is in a really fun spot right now (again, discounting the drum gun) and I think we ought to credit epic for being able to change the game while still making it 'Fortnite', because not a lot of other games can do that.

 So enough hate for now, let's just try and adjust to the changes in the game without flaming the creators, at least for a little while. Give it a chance &lt;3 We all love this game and that's why we're so expressive about it, but come on, lets try and see what Epic wants to do for the game, because this might be a decision that they made to finally prioritise between casual and competitive and it'll just take some time for it to happen.

* **Edit plays are less rewarding** - you can no longer kill someone by doing a quick edit play and shooting them in the head unless they're very weak.

* **Fights use more mats** - You can no longer finish fights with a good headshot so the fights last longer and you burn through more materials. Increased fire rate doesn't help because you either build after you shoot or your enemy will so you can't get two shots off on a good player.

* **More 3rd parties** - longer fights also mean increased chance of 3rd parties

* **You're left with less HP** - enemies have a second chance to shoot you back

* **Only good counter to smg spray is gone** - you can no longer wait for an enemy to spray your wall then time your shot to get a good amount of damage on them. A drum gun kills both 200hp and 150hp opponents faster than two perfect combat shotgun shots to the head.

* **High risk but low reward** - The combat shotgun requires very good aim but deals a low amount of damage, it's better to just use a drum gun.


If siphon was still in the game and smgs were nerfed it wouldn't be too bad but this change is a nerf to both building and editing and a buff to smgs which decreases the skill gap.

Results for the Game

-no shredding trough enemys resources
-Shotguns would would be more viable in CQC

The actual state for me is that for the first time since I started playing FN (playing since there where any seasons in game), I dont need a shotgun in CQC fights and i can spray down my opponents with two drum guns and mp. For me the unique playstyle of FN is in the actual state gone. The build fights are not that satisfying anymore before the unvaulting of the drum gun.
The high risk and high reward plays are not needed because you can shred enemys structures with this gun.
I dont want the pump back, i like the new shot gun and i like a meta change but this spraying destroys the unique building which made FN that successful.

“We already no what happens, stop stating the obvious. This post is unnecessary”. Every post on this sub is unnecessary, it’s still here isn’t it 🤷‍♀️ 
“(insert something that I said) is completely wrong” I’m sorry, I’m not an expert
“Sexy grill” it’s 8:42 (only ASaltyBunion fans will get it)
With that out of the way, here’s all that happened in season 9
Firstly the battle bass. Can we agree that the skins either look like characters from other series or youtubers. Like the max tier skin looking like Avery and the tier one skin looking like loserfruit. But the battle pass is good. It’s probably in the middle of battlepasses. Out of the 8 we’ve gotten I’d rank it 5th. The skins are lit (including homeless tfue) we got the best pet ever, we now have duel wield picks and more. It’s a great battle pass
Next added/removed items. Epic did a 7.40 (I think that’s the update when they removed the bolt?) and vaulted a bunch of weapons. These were the thermal scoped ar, scoped revolver, suppressed AR, balloons, poison darts, clingers and the most important gun in the game, the pump shotgun. This one makes me really sad as it’s a pretty good gun and a symbol of fortnite. It’s the most hated part of this season. On a good side, we have the new combat shotgun which is like a reinvented tac, I love it and they brought back grenades, for some reason. Also they added slipstreams, fortnite basically made there game 3rd party centural.
Then there were locations, starting with neo tilted. It’s awesome. I love how they kept tilted very similar, yet completely revamped it. It’s probably the best map change ever. They also introduced mega mall, which I’m disappointed in. With such a hype tilted, I was expecting way more from retail, the most loved location ever. But there is also dusty divot 2.0 or moist mire 3.0, pressure plant. I’m not a big fan. I liked the volcano and I’m sad to see it go, but pressure plant isn’t very good. They’ve also added “sky drones”. I don’t know what else to call them. They have some loot and they’re this seasons pirate camps, loot lake had the dusty treatment and grew a bunch of plants.

First of all, i am not a ""hater"" who say ""please 50hp per kill"" or""Fortnite is not fun"". I really love this game and season 9 is crazy. However, you can enjoy Fortnite and criticize it ( this word means give his opinion in order to make something better).

Now, lets talk about what can be improved. I think we always have to think about pros and casual so each time i will say why this changement can ne good for them.

The shotguns :
Shotguns are the biggest controversy of season 9. When the combat shotgun will be fixed (according to Daequan's video damages are not given properly), i think we should increase its headshot damages to 150 ( more headshot multiplier or increase normal damages and keep 1.7 multiplier).

Pros: In e-sports, everything happen in last circles and everybody is taking some shots so they have 150 Hp max when close combat begins. 150 damages are enough to ""one shot"".

Casual: it is the same, nobody has 200 hp because everybody is taking mini shield and there is no 50 hp each kill

Drum gun:
The community chose the drum gun during the unvaulting event so instead of revault it, we should balance it because it's a bit too overpowered.
I think we should decrease its damage ( 22-23) so that you can't destroy buildings too fast and also decrease its fire rate because when you spam drum gun you can go through builds.

If a shotgun can deal a significant amount of damage to almost kill you with a body shot, then so should a sniper, hence 150 base damage.

Headshots should always be a kill, but 150 for a base shot with shotguns dealing much less damage, it doesn’t seem right. At least on pc, it is not hard to aim.

Just watched this great video from that denverguy - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eq95vnpycY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eq95vnpycY)

here is my thoughts on it...

People are calling Ninja a hypocrite saying he was talking trash but now all of a sudden he is Fortnites Golden Boy which isn't true, Ninjas main source of money and fame has come from fortnite. Once fortnite dies Ninja dies with it, ninja will not become irrelevant but viewers and fame will decline Ninjas point is that EPIC is going to kill its game either way right now which does seem the case. If content creators bash the game it's only going to die faster than it will be EPIC killing it on its own, the content creators are in the long run making the reason they got fame and spotlight go away faster than it has to. Makes a lot more sense from a business side !!

really encourage you to watch the full video and give me your OPINION !!!&lt;3",FortNiteBR

However, I'm personally sick of people advocating for the vault because they think there's a problem with the pump's ability to one shot at close range.

First of all, the one shot does require skill. Camera angles at close range are extremely awkward (FOV) and your entire crosshair has to be on their head. But I agree there is an element of skill to it, and those who die to one pumps often feel cheated. 200 HP gone in a second?

I've seen most compare it to being one shot by a sniper. It takes skill to headshot (or bodyshot in the Heavy Sniper's case), as you have to lead your shot properly and predict their movement. That requires more skill than the pump shot, some luck, and some bad play from the victim (not aware of the sniper, too predictable movement, etc).

One pumping requires a small amount of skill from the shooter, luck, and also a bad play from the victim - letting themselves into point-blank pump range. 

So in comparison to a sniper kill, pumps require less skill from the shooter and more lack of skill. 

I believe the reason most people complain about one-shot pumps is that they refuse to acknowledge that they themselves made a poor play and let themselves get into one shot range, especially those who complain about getting one shot by someone they got to low health.

I can agree that the game may have required some more diversity, but the one-pump is not one of the reasons the pump should remain vaulted.",FortNiteBR

From season 8 to 9 all we asked for is a better performance and fixing some of the serious bugs that ruin the fun of this game and of course : dont fix it if its not broken , but i guess epic would like to fuck with their game and i hope it keeps ruining it till it dies like it did with paragon.

i've spent more than 900$ on this game from season 2 till season 7 ( planes ) and i stopped buying vbucks cause i dont like this game anymore but im playing it anyway some hours per day. And what im sure of right now is i will never ever spend 1$ on this game till they fix it really ... ( by the way im not hopping that epic fix it soon , tbh i dont really care because my money in my wallet "" free game "" right ) 

i know that this sub is only minority compared to 200 million players , but epic communicate with us here , and let them know that we really really had enough of this shitty changes that no one likes. 

i decided to stop buying a long time ago and im asking this too from my friends , and i think its the time for you too dear members to do the same.

For starters I looked at the chat logs of the days with the highest activity each month from March, 2018 to April 2019^(1). 

These data included over **1,000,000** messages. 

https://i.redd.it/czrdde9qahx21.png

I took this data and converted it into a giant dictionary of words/emotes and tallied how often each individual one was used.

&amp;#x200B;

# What did I find?

Well almost all of the most frequently typed items were *\*drumroll\*.....* emote spam! I know, you're shocked. 

https://i.redd.it/nreft0ikbhx21.png

However, I kept looking through the data and found some interesting trends. Typically, when a someone wants to express hype they'll just spam emotes. But the other way to express your hype is to yell ""lmaooo!!!"" or ""yooo!!!"" Words like these include:

* lmaooo
* nooo
* yoooo
* gooooo
* ninjaaaaaa
* yesssssss
* loooool

What's going on here is a case of vowel lengthening (except for ""yes"", there it is consonant lengthening or *gemination*).

# Lengthening

Many languages in the world have lengthening as an active part of the language. For example, in Japanese ""Ojisan"" means uncle, while ""Ojiisan"" means grandfather ^(2). In Japanese vowel length is contrastive and two words might have different meanings based on the length of the vowel. However, what is going on in Ninja's chat is emphatic. Meaning there is no semantic (meaning) based difference  between""lmao"" and ""lmaoo"", the difference is on emphasis (or hype).

Since chat is only orthographic (written), I wanted to see if there was a trend in how *long*  the hyped version of each of these words is. So I measured the frequency of 1 extra letter all the way to 12 extra.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/i7mrpav8lhx21.png

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/pc5417qflhx21.png

https://i.redd.it/g64999qflhx21.png

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wei60vzlmhx21.png

For ""lmao"", ""yo"", ""go"", ""lol"", and ""yes"" the most common way to lengthen was with +2 extra letters. While with ""no"" it was +3. Seems like ""nooo"" just doesn't express it well enough, you really need to yell ""noooooooo"" (+7, 109 occurrences).  Also, for some reason you guys really don't like saying ""loooool"" (+4, 9 occurrences) but are much cooler with the +3 and +5 versions  \*shrug\*. 

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of ""lol"", if you were paying close attention you would have noticed it is the only word that has the emphatic lengthening in the middle of the word, and not at the end. Curiously enough it is also unique in that it is the only one of these words which also regularly uses emphatic reduplication.

# Reduplication

Reduplication is a linguistic phenomena where all or part of a word is repeated for some reason. In English this would be the difference when you ask, "" Do you **like** them? Or do you **likelike** them?"". Here we fully reduplicate ""like"" in order to specify the definition of ""to have a crush"" versus ""to find enjoyable"". While English has  few examples of reduplication, languages like Indonesian feature a lot of reduplication. For example, ""satu"" means ""the number one"" while ""satu-satu"" means ""one at a time"". In Indonesian reduplication can be full or partial and doing it can have a wide variety of meanings, including emphasis, plurality, continuousness, and much more ^(3). 

In the case of ""lol"" the reduplication is emphatic and looks like ""lolol"" where the second half of ""lol"" is duplicated. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/re8vxpqmqhx21.png

As you can see above, partial replication, ""lolol"", is actually preferred over ""lool"" and ""loool"". While full reduplication, ""lollol"" only ever happens once. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

So it seems as though if you want to type your hype, the most common method is lengthening with +2 extra letters. Unless of course you are loling in which case you'll want to use partial reduplication! 

However, there has been one thing I left out: using the words normally (without any hype) which is what most people actually seem to do (by a long shot). ""lmao"" (5444 occurrences) versus ""lmaooo"" (403 occurrences), ""lmaoo"" is only 7% of the lmao's 

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/yvlbnbhnrhx21.png

I hope some of you found this cool!

P.s. Stay in school kids :D

Epic wants fortnite to be a battle Royale for kids. I mean this is already kinda obvious but the changes make sense. The changes make it so no one can be killed one hit (at close range) and that gives them time to react.

If you look at other battle royales (PUBG, Blackout, Apex) you can't really sponge much damage (well except maybe apex, but I haven't played much). However, in this new meta, if you get shot by someone, you have plenty of time to build and you haven't taken much damage either. It reminds me a bit of overwatch where you're forced to take some damage in order to kill someone.

I feel like this new meta might suit building better as you are able to build to counter stuff better and it will be more effective.

I believe it would be genuinely possible for people to not carry a shotgun and still stand a chance against normal players.

Basically they're reducing the damage of everything in order that make fights last longer and (possibly) make them less RNG.

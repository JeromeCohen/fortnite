Here are some ways they could tweak them better impact the game!,"For example, dropping in lonely lodge and being able to have your entire squad buy RPGs shouldn't be a thing that can happen. While I like the idea of the vending machines, they should be tweaked. In my opinion, here's how they could be tweaked for the better.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1- Every vending machine should have 3 options: a health or shield option, a grenade or place-able option, and a weapon option. It would go as following:


- **Health** items would always be purchased with wood, and could contain the following:

**Green* 5 bandages, or 3 small shield potions

**Blue* 1 large shield potion, 5 small potions, 10 bandages, or 1 medkit

**Purple* 1 Slurp + 3 bandages, 1 Slurp + 3 small potions, or 2 medkits

**Gold* 3 medkits, 10 small shield potions, or 1 Chug Jug


- **Grenades / Place-able** items would always be purchased with brick, and could contain the following:

**Green* 3 grenades, or 1 trap

**Blue* 3 impact grenades, 1 boogie bomb, or 1 campfire 

**Purple* 1 launch pad, 2 boogie bombs, 2 campfires, or 4 traps

**Gold* 3 launch pads, 1 full stack of impact grenades (regular grenades, or boogie bombs), or 5 traps + 3 campfires + 1 launch pad


- **Weapons** would only be purchased with metal, and would contain all of the weapons in the game, except the guided missile. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2- Some items should be able to be purchased through the vending machines, like RPGs, Scars, and Chug Jugs. **However** they could stay as purchasable items if **one (or several)** of the following changes were implemented: 


- The resource is based on the quality of item ie: RPGs can only be purchased with metal, green Tactical Shotgun could be purchased with wood etc.


- With every purchase of an item at a vending machine, the cost increases. If an RPG is bought for 500 metal, the next one can be bought for 600 metal, then 800 metal, then 999 metal every time after that.


- Adding a realistic 'SOLD OUT' sign for specific items bandages could be purchased as many times as wanted, same thing with lower rarity items, but all legendary items are limited to 1 purchase per squad no matter the size of the squad.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I currently really like the ideas of the vending machines, but I think that they could be tweaked to have a better impact on the game. Thanks for reading! I'd love to hear your thoughts!",FortNiteBR

After just uninstalling fortnite I have realized how much time I have spent with it, and now I will start doing more useful things with my life. I did save footage of a lot of my wins which I can use, so this time wasn't just purely for entertainment or wasted.

I started out like anyone, struggling to get wins, but was still having fun learning the game and progressively grtting better. Then I really got the hang of it and was getting way more wins. But lately there's just been something off, it feels lile I've only been going backwards. But in the gameplays its not me, its the game. Too many times where I've died and I felt that there was nothing I could have done.

Yeah I just haven't been having fun, and reading some other posts on here lately, it seems I'm not the only one.

Protest with your wallets too,"This game is *unplayable* on xbox one. Lag spikes in the early game, server lag, lag spikes during combat, buildings not loading, guns not loading, guns not switching, not being able to shoot, not being able to build, not being able to edit, etc. Every update adds more glitches and lag instead of fixing the old ones.  The flawed game mechanics start to annoy you fast after playing for more than 200hours. Oh, you have a perfect shot on a guy and you need to kill him fast because you’re low on health? Too bad, because hitting a second shot in a row is less likely than finding a scar in the first building you land in(still possible, but rng). This makes all the middle range weapons feel unsatisfying to use. The tilted towers made this game even less skill based, because more than 50% of the players dies before the first circle. You want fights? You have to go to Tilted towers. You want to go to tilted towers? You’re going to get killed by the xbox one x owners because their buildings and guns actually *load*. Well, if you don’t want to go to tilted and you want to go somewhere else, then you’ll have to run for the half of your game without encountering more than 5 players.  Not landing in tilted also makes you use medium range weapons, which makes you again realize how flawed this game is.

What is this game atm? - Bob the builder simulator with mediocre gun mechanics and 20$ cosmetics.

If you feel the same about this game right now, you should use your wallets to let Epic know what’s up. If they will get more pressure from its playerbase, then maybe they’ll finally start fixing their game instead of implementing useless or even more game-breaking things such as C4s and guided missiles into the game.",FortNiteBR

I was getting decent loot from the factories, and all of a sudden a no skin with no weapons runs into my building. I didnt shoot him because i know the struggle of not having a weapon at the start. I killed the guy that was chasing him down and split the loot. Jay followed me to dusty where i picked up another kill, and i let jay take the loot. (We were i guess kinda teaming in solos so epic i'm sorry. We never really helped each other get kills tho, it was individual targets.) by top 5 i got killed by another john wick, so i spectated until that john wick was shotgunned by Jay. i spectated jay the entire game and he won it in the end. All i can say is, bro you deserve that win. Idk if you;ll ever see this but i hope you do and i hope we can play duos some day. [PS4]

$20 for a skin is wayyyy too much, the for a Battle Royale game where you literally cannot earn anything without spending some type of $$$, the other option to just buy the skins shouldn't be so harsh on your wallet!

You remember that skin you really wanted? But you couldn't get it because $10-20 simply to change your character's appearance is way too much? 

There is also a big flaw in the marketing system, 

First off, the cheapest option is $10, and considering all of the spending options are 100% cosmetic, this is WAYY too much.

Yes, buying the skins is a choice, but who wants to walk around with a default skin in a game as popular as this? This is the most popular game of the past 5 years and possibly the decade, of course alot of people will want to change how they look.

I'm calling you out because this is what killed CS:GO and Paragon. Ignoring serious flaws and just pumping in cosmetics.

Fortnite may be free, but we all know how much you make. Just join a match and see how many people have a skin. You can't just say ""well it's a free game, we owe them nothing"" ""you don't need to buy skins"" ""just don't play it if you hate it"" because it IS our game.

We are the main reason Epic has made so much money.

Look, what I am saying is that pussying out and trying to ignore concerned posts is what will kill Fortnite. A lack of communication and failure to resolve issues.

Ignoring the posts and acting innocent isn't going to help you guys in the long run.

It will kill the game that we all love.

Epic, I *fucking dare you* to respond to this. I know you won't, but if you don't, you are just showing how much you care about the game and your fans. None.

What i get from the other side however is completely unnecessary and honestly the most idiotic thing i've ever seen in a videogame.

If someone downs me in the game, they ALWAYS kill me immediately (which i'm ok with in every case instead of this one) EVEN WHILE THEY ARE BEING SHOT AT by my teammates.

Right now, my teammates are playing the game still where i've been killed by a team where all 3 people started to shoot me while my teammates were killing them from behind from 5 meters.

In the game before this, i managed to down 2 people from a team, one of my teammate got knocked down but my other teammate knocked out their 3rd member so there were only one guy left from their team and what did he do out of all the possible billion scenarios? Killed me in front of my teammate instead of killing my teammate and then our team would have been done forever. But no, he killed only me and he died immediately.

I'm done with all the PS4 players now. I'll always kill everyone even if i'm being killed. If you play like this, you'll get it too. No one realizes that we do this to each other and it became a common thing because no one cares and the problem is generating itself now.

I personally like it because it makes guns like the hand cannon more viable, and makes it possible to land long-range AR shots without having to play the RNG game. RNG takes away from skill every time. This is hardly debatable. There's no skill involved in something you have no control over.

If two people 170m away from each other with 200hp and legendary scars were on a flat plane and shot at each other in the exact same spot, at the same rate of fire, mathematically speaking, if you simulated this situation enough times, it'd be possible for one to live with 200hp while the other dies. There's no skill involved there.

Now take the First Shot Accuracy change. It's all about positioning, rhythm, and accuracy. If you stand still/your movement is too predictable, it can be rightfully punished. This will greatly increase the importance of good building as well.

The damage decrease during your First Shot, as well as the damage fall-offs over range, keeps it balanced since nothing can one shot you from long-distance if you have full hp, giving you enough time to properly react if you are shot.",FortNiteBR

Please help. I sent a support email but received no confirmation or ticket number. I met the nicest person in the entire world on Fortnite and I am trying to buy him a battlepass for his birthday because he is unable to buy it for himself. I am in Canada but he is in the US so when I log onto his account to buy him the 1000 V-bucks, it prevents me from using my Canadian credit card because there is no Province or Postal Code option. And when I made a PayPal account, it outright declined my transaction because countries did not match. Please disable country verification for a single transaction or whatever else you need to do to let me buy him the pass he deserves so much.

If you can't do this, please consider giving him the 1000 V-bucks. He is the nicest player I think I will ever come across. I can tell Fortnite means the world to him and despite how much he plays, he will constantly try and help others over himself. He will constantly drop you higher tier weapons while keeping lower tier weapons and running away so you can't give it back. He will do the same thing with heals and shields. One match he didn't even pick up a weapon and just carried shields and heals for the squad and focused on being a medic for the squad. He is the living personification of ""God's Plan"" and this is not a Drake meme. Beyond this, he is so family oriented in real life and has such a positive perspective it makes my heart melt. 

Please help me Epic. Nobody in this game deserves a battlepass more than my friend and I am prevented by your system from giving it to him.

I've put in over 185 hours and played in over 1,400 matches. I've been a talking billboard for the game to anyone I know. I'm worried that Fortnite is about to go downhill. 


I know that when Epic introduces new weapons or items, everyone worries about them ruining the game. The reason is that we love this game and are sometimes afraid of change. That said, Epic has done an amazing job of integrating new weapons without messing up the winning formula. That is until now. With the guided missile launcher and the vending machines, they are moving in the wrong direction. 


Yes, the guided missile launcher is fun. However, it's extremely overpowered, especially in duos and squads. The only defense is to knock it out of the sky or build yourself in. On PS4, without aim-assist + bloom, it's pretty hard to hit. Especially if someone changes directions a lot. Building yourself in allows the enemy team to advance on you. Even in solos it's a bit too much. You have players killing with a rocket launcher across the map. They don't necessarily need to get rid of this. They can fix it by lowering the HP of the missile, enabling aim-assist with a controller, giving it a longer reload, making the time much shorter to control the missile, and possibly limiting its range. 

As much as RND sometimes screws me over with chests, the ability to buy rocket launchers and golden scars for 300 to 500 wood is ridiculous. Yesterday, our squad of four all bought rocket launchers for 300 wood each. We won the match pretty easily. I get that that vending machines allow players to win based on skill versus RND, but vending machines should not sell powerful weapons. They should at most just sell shields, med kits, SMGs, and up to blue ARs. If you are going to include powerful weapons, make them an absurd amount of resources. Make a golden scar 500 wood and 500 brick. Another thing you can do is limit the amount of weapons it has. For example, each vending machine carries one rocket launcher, one blue shield, and one AR. Prevents an entire team to carry four rocket launchers.

Lastly, like many other posts, just focus on fixing bugs for a while. There are so many issues in the game right now, especially on consoles. Focusing the next two to four weeks on fixing these issues would be better than adding any new items to the game. 

These are just my thoughts. Let me know what you guys think. 

Edit: Changed auto-aim to aim-assist. Thanks Tcarl757 for pointing this out.

2) Now correct me if I'm wrong (which i most likely am), but most companies have seperate teams for each category of a game. For example, the creators of the game Dead By Daylight have a number of teams for their game, devoted to individual categories, such as art, gameplay, and bug fixing. With the HUGE amount of success that fortnite BR has had, you can only assume that they have similar teams. The ""bug team"" is probably working their hardest to fix the known bugs, and the ""gameplay team"" to release new bug free content.

I do understand why you added it. A lot of people, including me, complained about the bloom mechanic and how it could feel like the gunfights were too random at times. And this is how you decided to fix it. But in my opinion it's not going to work. I'd rather have bloom screw me and know there's nothing I could have done, than have a headshot give me mediocre damage because the enemy was just barely out of range.

A subtle form of psychological conditioning provided by the media to acquaint the public with planned societal changes.(widely referred to across a lot of conspiracy / government cover ups)

The prime example of this would be 9/11 and how from as far back as the 1940's subtle references have been given to the fact that something was going to happen to the twin towers.

(Yes of course this sounds stupid however with how coincidentally a lot of this fits together there is no denying that it gets you thinking) 

This is a link to a compilation of predictive programming in tv shows etc related to predictive programming: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AUclXzapJo

Anyways now that i've given an example of predictive programming here is the actual Theroy.

A short time ago something blew up on Twitter about a guy by the name of @strayedaway who received a disturbing voicemail on his phone in the nato phonetic alphabet which is used often in military and customer service however when translated it came out saying 
""Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human"" (this played on a loop).

Many believe this to be from the black box recording from the Malaysia flight 370 that mysteriously went missing and due to transmission error he ended up receiving the message.

After posting this voicemail recording to twitter he received a number of weird threats and messages ordering him to take the voicemail off of twitter in different languages as well as a couple in morse code. 

Now these message are important as one of them when translated from morse code came out as 
""they are taking over 4/18/18 (April 18th 2018)""

This date look familiar? like from the meteor (or what we think is a meteor) in fortnite? where in the coding the same numbers are listed ""418""

So what if the government is working with Epic who currently have  the most popular game on the planet to prepare society for something big happening in real life on the 18th of April?

In its current state it feels clunky, implements slower gameplay, and harms some weapons (Burst Rifle).

I don’t personally mind the idea of First Shot Accuracy as it helps make some guns relevant such as the Revolver and Hand Cannon. But I think it needs to feel more fluid.

I don’t like that you must stand still for a set amount of time and then the crosshairs “snaps” into place. I feel it would be a lot more of a smooth experience if it just slowly closed all the way in and if you were to shoot earlier than that your shot would go anywhere in between where the crosshairs currently shrunk to.

Say a new COD game is being released on October 12th, so epic games would release no updates in the first half of October, then release a very large update on October 11th. The key here is to keep people playing fortnite for the crucial first few days after a new game launches.

First of all I think that while true Accuracy is great, this was done the wrong way. I was under the impression that they were going to add recoil and damage drop off to all weapons, not this weird hybrid of concepts. This change simply rewards camping and passive play styles. It doesn't bring anything needed to the game. The main problem with the Shooting Mechanics was consistency and this doesn't even solve that. Your second shot is still completely random, and since none of the guns with first shot accuracy are 1 shot kills,  it's still random who wins the gun fight. 




Second of all, I don't understand why epic would add true accuracy with it recoil. The ideal way to fix the shooting Mechanics is to add a combination of; Full Accuracy, Damage Drop Off, and Full Recoil, on every weapon. This is in my opinion the only way to truly add consistency to the game. It would also allow for Epic to make each gun only effective in a certain situation. As it stands guns are used based on effectiveness with the bloom aspect. This brings me to my third point.




Shotguns are ridiculously OP in this game for one simple reason. They break the rules for shooting accurately in this game.  Simply put they are the only guns that you can strafe, jump, and shoot while falling accurately with.  The game encourages you to crouch and ADS to shoot more accurately but you can do that and still miss a shot while some can jump on your head and hit every pellet from their shotgun. I don't understand the logic behind allowing only shotguns to be useful and reliable while moving, when they should be the only guns that are subject to rng.




My last point is that these shooting models reward bad players, slightly handicap good players and absolutely fucks intermediate players. To put it simply is hard for players in the middle of the spectrum to consistently get better at shooting. I for one rely on hit markers to understand how well I aimed in a fight. In this game my hitmakers are completely random and confuse me during gun fights. Basically this game makes it incredibly difficult to get better at aiming.



TLDR:

In conclusion, First Shot Accuracy is bad for the game because it's only a half assed solution. In addition True Accuracy without recoil is BS and due to second shot rng  can be insanely OP. Shotguns are OP because they are ( ironically ) the most consistent guns to shoot while moving in any way. This game needs recoil and damage drop off to truly add a skilled aspect to shooting and to insure each gun is effective at a certain range. Weapon selection should be based on how comfortable a player is fighting at a certain range, certainly not which guns work and which ones don't. 



Epic needs to seriously address this issue or they will lose the semi competitive audience they have.  I for one want to know for sure I lost a (gun) fight because of my skill and not RNG.

250,Mackktastic,1522940953,8a0hon,129,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8a0hon/i_think_its_time/,880,I think it's time,"I saw the post yesterday about how we won't stop playing Fortnite if the devs focus on bugs as opposed to new content / skins for a bit and I couldn't agree more. But, as the last few days have gone by, I find myself on the verge of not only taking a break from the game as a whole, but purchasing any sort of cosmetics altogether. 

As someone who has put in a serious amount of money towards cosmetics I feel duped. I initially started purchasing skins because I fell in love with the game and legitimately wanted to help the devs in any way I could, whether it was my input here on Reddit or buying skins to put money back into the game - I wanted to continue contributing to making the game incredible. 

But I think now it's time, I think I'm done with purchasing skins no matter how cool they be, done with purchasing emotes no matter how novel they seem; I might even be done playing and pushing my friends to play. 

There have been dozens of posts about ""take out the guided missile"" or ""we dont want stupid vending machines"" -- this is NOT one of those posts. I love the new implementations of this game and I'm excited to see 6 months from now how many cool adaptations are in the game from where we first started - all of us as no-skins dancing with the scrub emote playing at 30 fps. 

But the state of the game needs to be a priority NOW. We haven't had a day or week without bugs since as far as I can remember. And the craziest part is you KNOW your servers aren't strong enough for this player-base right now. You can't handle weekend numbers. You can't even handle post-update numbers... yet you open up the game to mobile - putting even more stress on your already weak-ass servers. 

Hire more devs, hire a better support team, hire more people for QA-ing the game, focus on your servers. Don't take 2 weeks between content dumps, take 2 MONTHS. Focus on making the game nearly perfect, and find a system for implementing new updates that don't create a dozen new bugs.

* Collect resources and search every house and building you come across top to bottom.   
* Hit every cabinet, wardrobe, bookcase, counter-top, fridge, table, chair, caravan, fence etc.    
* Don't hit walls, they give the worst mats per hit.    
* Tap when you shoot and don't hold down the trigger, 2-3 shot burst or single firing when the reticle resets is more accurate and does more damage over time (you aren't wasting your bullets missing people).
* Keep distance between you and your enemy.
* Focus your reticle on them at all times when firing.
* Crouching whilst aiming throws people off and makes you more accurate, jump after a few shots to throw your opponent off.
* Building gives you immediate cover allowing you to shoot at them with relative safety. You'll learn to shoot faster when you're safe in your own building at medium ranges.
* Learn deep breathing exercises, this will help when the stress of a fight and the pressure of being out-built hits you. 

You collect resources incredibly quickly and have a chance in winning games because taking the time out to gear up and practice building on the way to the zone is better than going to tilted and dying in seconds.

The proof is the downfall of Paragon.,"This is not a rant post, this is a informative post to people who have no idea what ""Paragon"" is, and how Epic neglected known issues because they wanted to push for new content instead of doing what the community asked and what the game ultimately needed to be functioning successfully.

I don’t come onto this reddit forum often, but after just browsing through i can see posts of people ranting about getting ""New Vending machines"" and no fixes to matchmaking. I feel your frustration, and i hope none of you EVER experience what Paragon players went through by watching our favorite game fall and die simply because of EPIC's neglect.

Little Information on EPIC’s treatment towards Paragon and its players(You can skip if you don’t care)

Paragon was Epic's Third person MOBA that had so much potential, but was consistently being tested and being thrown around with new heroes releases, new items, and unwanted balance changes that just didn't make sense and broke the game even more. Eventually, when Fortnite BR took off, they decided to stop developing Paragon because they simply were not getting anything right, and wanted to push a product that could make them millions in sales. In business terms this makes sense, but it was harsh to us Paragon players when Epic made a promise 2 weeks before the closure announcement that, they are listening to our feedback, and will be changing the game dramatically with new matchmaking and Ranked mode being added.

They lied, and just closed the game on us.

Excellent videos on this: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jum-mc8arkw&amp;t=1s (&lt;--Really good)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD5d2oCcqNM


What thousands have learned from this:
1. Epic has a problem communicating to their community (This is Obvious in Fortnite/Paragon)
2. They will always push cosmetics and game features over extremely necessary fixes (Especially when it comes to matchmaking)
3. They will only make changes when the community is 100% fed up with their BS, and have made tons of rant posts/protests on their forums, videos, and any of their social media.

MY BEST ADVICE TO EVERYONE WHO LOVES THIS GAME:

COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY AND DON'T GIVE UP!!! It is very important to consistently express your opinions towards epic or nothing will ever change. Something that Paragon reddit never had, was the amount of exposure r/FortNiteBR has. Some of these posts on here get easily 5-7k upvotes, that means its on r/all. Many people on reddit know of fortnite in general even if they don't follow this subreddit. That exposure to the front page of reddit with problems leads to horrible publicity for EPIC games and at the end of the day they are a business, and no business EVER wants bad publicity. (Just look at EA's Video game failures)

Keep ranting on this reddit and keeping pushing for changes, NEVER BACK DOWN. If your a youtuber i highly recommend making a video about a problem you see and how it can be fixed. 

Like i said before, i hope you all never have to suffer with EPIC too long like the thousands of Paragon players did.

TLDR: EPIC can be extremely stubborn on their changes and what they view as a future for their games. KEEP POSTING, the more constructive rant posts the faster they will be forced to do something.

You Epic Games are SO involved in creating new stuff that WE casual players can't even update on time to play your game.

That is a good thing to be creative but there should be a mode for casual where you don't need all the updates, maybe a mode limited to ""standard"" weapons, ""standard"" stuff just to play a few games without worrying about constant updates.

But in squads, it's completely killed any chance of an underdog winning in the final fight. I was just playing squads with 3 of my friends, they all died early on and I continued to play. I got 13 and the final fight was a 1v3. When theres a 1v3, there is literally nothing you can do to win unless they are completely incompetent. Theres zero counterplay to hundreds of bullets that can break through walls and fuck your girlfriend. All it takes is for the other two to shoot at you or just push while you're hiding from the first guy shooting.

""Just shoot back!""

Yeah, that's a great idea except I need to shoot 3 times as much to kill them and I need to be exposed the entire time, where they can just safely shoot bullet after bullet in the late game with probably 999 ammo stockpiled up from every other squad they've killed. While his teammates spray me with sniper fire or fire from gold scars. I can't possibly stay exposed to shoot them all down. And even if I did, when is my opportunity to shoot them? How on earth is it balanced?

It has 0 place in the game other than solos where there are legitimate drawbacks to using it. When you have 3 people protecting you, theres no counter-play.

This needs to happen ASAP for squads to even be remotely playable.

This last update has been a great step in the right direction for the game, but the last thing there is to clean up that isn't a bug fix is the Assualt Rifle. Another idea I've heard tossed around is to limit ammo to like 3 shots - like an impulse grenade or something similar. That wouldn't be too bad, but the current Assault Rifle is absolutely broken in squads at the moment. In that 1v3 I could've easily won had I been able to counterfight them whatsoever. The one time someone peeked while another AR wasn't up I was able to headshot him with my sniper, but then I couldn't get close cause I had no jump pad and they continued the bullet spam.

I think squad and duo games are completely different, primarily when outnumbered. 

Before the guided missile, if it was two on four, you at least had a chance. But now, if the enemy team has just one guided missile and are somewhat competent, there's almost nothing you can do, no matter how good you are at the game. One enemy can guide the missile towards you, which leaves you either exposed to enemy fire while shooting it down or as a sitting duck in a box. When the enemy's teammates start shooting explosives of their own, or spamming your walls, it's pretty much always game over.

I'm probably just an average player but I know all of the counters to the guided missile: build, shoot it down, and push while they reload, or, spam their walls and shoot them while they guide it. Neither of these methods are usually viable if you're outnumbered and not playing a potato patch.

You know the type, two combatants enter a fierce completion of who can build the best lego tower fastest and clap the other with a shotgun from above. Ever since it was popularized by high level streamers it has become the meta for what is considered higher level play. The problem however is that it is quickly becoming viewed by a sizeable portion of the Fortnite community as the end all for defining a player’s skill. This presents a problem. For me, I’d say I’m pretty damn good at building, I can hold my own and generally come out victorious in these 500+ resource build off battles. Thing is, it’s just not my favorite way to play. Many times I opt out and choose to relocate further away and kill my opponent as they try to rush me again. Sometimes I simply don’t have the resources necessary to get into an intense building battle, but I still often get that angry message afterwards anyway. Or, my favorite solution is to hop down mid build battle and cut down the support of the towers, causing my enemy to fall to their deaths. But ever increasingly as of late I get more and more rage messages calling me all manner of names from “scrub” to things that I probably shouldn’t repeat in text. Why? Because I killed someone who was trying to outbuild me by choosing to eliminate them another way, by not engaging in a frantic match of tower of power.

I think it really needs to be addressed in the Fortnite community that this trend is starting to take hold of players who consider build battles to be the only “skillful” means of killing an opponent. Dare to kill someone through other means? Then prepare to get flamed. It’s honestly becoming the current version of Call of Duty’s quickscoping debacle. Anyone who would “hard scope” or use “reg guns” in Call of Duty would get blasted, you HAD to quickscope to be considered “skilled”. Pretty ridiculous honestly, because there is so much more depth to Fortnite’s combat than just seeing who can spam ramps over the other’s head better. The gunplay, the positioning, knowing when to rush, when to defend, when to flank, using the diverse weapon arsenal to your advantage, etc.


  **Just because you can outbuild someone doesn’t make you a better/more skilled player.**


If anything I just wish that point to be understood. Watching highly skilled players try to outbuild each other at incredible speeds is always entertaining to see for sure. But I don’t want the Fortnite community to devolve into a place where anyone who chooses to deviate from that norm in order to win is blasted for it or immediately written off as a lesser player. Not trying to come off as ranting here, just kind of getting sick of the increasingly common hate messages when I kill someone some other way than trying to feverishly outbuild them ten stories up. That’s my take on the current state of the Fortnite competitively oriented community.

Currently there are a couple of ways to counter - build or shoot. I'm for the addition of the recently suggested an anti-air turret. 

The main point people make is 'But if you're the last member of a squad at the end it's impossible to win'...

Remove the missile and the majority of the time it is the same outcome - squads will drill you with ARs whilst you spam build. The only time clutch wins really happen are in close quarters, at which point the missile is fairly redundant.

Another observation of this scenario is that the opposing team have been aggressive (or lucky) enough to acquire rockets to constantly spam - how often do you end up with more than 20 rockets end game?

I'd also like to raise the question, how have you acquired the guided launcher yourself?

The majority of the time my squads have got one is through killing other teams, not by chests/drops. This is both mid and endgame. If they're so OP then why is that the case?

If you have any points or counter points, I'd love to address them. At the moment it seems like a salty loss coming here to vent, a lot of games I don't even see a guided missile (usually make it to the final few circles).

Here’s Why!

1.Bandwagon! 
   
This game has Most Bandwagon Players In video game history, Which means that Everyone Started to play This game Because Someone Started too, 
(example#1)Some Youtuber started playing This So Peeps wanted to Bandwagon This game By telling everyone to start playing Fortnite!

(Example#2)

- Steve” Hey! Chris! come play fortnite tonite”

-Chris” Nah i dont play Shit games Sry i only play Good games like PUBG”

-Steve” I know that fortnite sucks And that it’s possibly Worst game In This century, but everyone Else plays it So I ”like” it Too! 

-Chris” Steve... Dont be a bandwagoner, it’s Lame.

-Steve”Sry”

I hope You Guys stop playing This garbage game, it’s Free to olay For a Reason.

Epic?  Epic is awesome.  I love how they're schooling developers like Bungie, EA, and Ubisoft with how to treat their games and their fans.

With that being said...the current map sucks.  It has nothing to do with the points of interest, they're fine.  It has eveeything to do with the geography of the island.  Here are my three main issues. 

1.  We have no interesting choke points.  I guess Loot Lake kind of creates one, but not really.  This is a tactical game where players have interesting and fun ways to traverse the map.  Can we get some choke points where we have to ask our squad mates ""Do you want to build across and risk getting shot down?  Or should I rocket ride you guys over there?""  Right now we just slide down mountains and run wherever the **** we want.  Epic, please give us a few chasms to be fearful of.

2.  The mountains/valleys aren't large enough.  I just spent the past two days setting up bridge and ramp traps.  I'd set them up so enemies would run across, and take out the base so the whole structure collapses.   Here's what I found, most of the river valley is 5 or 6 tiles high.  Meaning if you drop someone at 4 or 5 tiles up, you don't kill them.  You need to get enemies 6 stories above the ground to kill them and that doesn't happen nearly enough.

3.  The river is a joke.  The river is such a meaningless geographical feature in this game.  You slide down, you run across, and up you go.  Crossing the river should give players meaningful decisions to make.

Anyone else kind of agree?",FortNiteBR

Little information about me: I was born deaf and wore hearing aids all my life. While I can still hear voices with hearing aids, but I still cannot make out words from people in any VoIP program (TeamSpeak, Mumble, Fortnite in-game voice, and so forth). Also, I have a speech disorder/impediment (deaf accent) that makes it extremely hard for my friends to understand what I'm trying to say. These are the glaring side effects from being deaf.

So, I am now finally speaking on behalf of some deaf / hard-of-hearing players that may be suffering the same situation as me:

Epic Games developer team, would you please finally implement **team chat in text** so that disabled people, like me, can read what other squad members are trying to inform of what's going on? If you are really worried about that becoming ""spammy"" on the screen (i.e. annoying person), then surely Epic Games can modify the already existing mute feature to block the text chat along with it. (Currently, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive already has this feature from right-clicking a person on the scoreboard to mute both voice and text.)

Lobby chat is already in the game, so I don't see why team text chat wouldn't be in-game as well. **Keep in mind though, that this feature should only apply to team/squads.** Please do NOT include ""all/everyone"" text as that would be very bad, imo. Other than that, I can't see any other disadvantages from adding team text chat.

I’m new to this subreddit, because I just started playing Fortnite with any regularity. Now that it’s out on mobile I can play it on my iPad, up until now I struggled to get good performance out of Fortnite on my Mac, but that’s a topic for another post.

I and other folks have posted mobile screenshots and have been mostly met with “lol” and downvotes. Can anyone explain why?

Playing Fortnite on mobile is really hard. The learning curve is immense. Aside from the lack of WASD controls, building is super clunky (Epic are you listening?) and difficult to do reactively. If anything, us mobile players have a really hard time.

Why the hate for folks on mobile - can anyone explain this to me?

I would like to address some of the concerns I have seen people mention about them, and make a case for why the devs should keep this new item in the game. Tweaks and improvements I am sure can be made, but this is generally defending the weapon as a concept.
1. I have seen a lot of people call the weapon OP. This normally happens with the initial implementation of a legendary gun, however from my experience, there are easy ways to counter them as far as quick building and taking advantage of their bad turning radius. For me, I smile when I see a RGM in the distance, because that is one big beacon to a virtually AFK player. Its slower, brighter, and leaves the pilot open for attack. It seems balanced to me in that regard.
2. Another objection is that it encourages camping and doesn't harmonize with the feel or style of the game. However, the recent C4s have shown remote control weapons do have a place in this game. The C4s and bush suits all have their advantages and disadvantages, all creating balanced play for whatever style people choose. 
There might be more objections, so feel free to continue the discussion. And there is always the chance this really isn't a debate at all and I am just clueless. Either way, I felt like giving some love to the devs for creating the gun, despite the negativity. 

Edit: Here is a link to a post I agree with on the matter that it should be removed from squads. https://www.reddit.com/r/fortnitebr/comments/89vl6n",FortNiteBR

But in squads, it's completely killed any chance of an underdog winning in the final fight. I was just playing squads with 3 of my friends, they all died early on and I continued to play. I got 13 and the final fight was a 1v3. When theres a 1v3, there is literally nothing you can do to win unless they are completely incompetent. Theres **zero** counterplay to heat seaking missiles that can wrap around walls and fuck your girlfriend. All it takes is for the other two to shoot at you or just push while you're hiding from the guided missile. 

""Just shoot it down!"" 

Yeah, that's a great idea except I need to shoot it 4 times to kill it and I need to be exposed the entire time, where he can just safely launch missile after missile in the late game with probably 50 missiles stockpiled up from every other squad they've killed. While his teammates spray me with sniper fire or fire from gold scars. I can't possibly stay exposed to shoot them all down. And even if I did, when is my opportunity to shoot them? How on earth is it balanced?

It has 0 place in the game other than solos where there are legitimate drawbacks to using it. When you have 3 people protecting you, theres no counter-play. 

This needs to happen ASAP for squads to even be remotely playable. 

This last update has been a great step in the right direction for the game, but the last thing there is to clean up that isn't a bug fix is the guided missile. Another idea I've heard tossed around is to limit ammo to like 3 shots - like an impulse grenade or something similar. That wouldn't be too bad, but the current guided missile is absolutely broken in squads at the moment. In that 1v3 I could've easily won had I been able to counterfight them whatsoever. The one time someone peeked while a missile wasn't up I was able to headshot him with my sniper, but then I couldn't get close cause I had no jump pad and they continued the missile spam.

5,whicketywack,1555533526,becqof,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/becqof/fortnite_is_an_extremely_violent_game/,1,Fortnite is an extremely violent game.,"Fortnite is an extremely violent game. I dont understand you parents that feel this game is appropriate for kids under 13. The justification is that there's no blood !!!!! Really ?!?!?!?! So would it be okey for your kids watching someone being drowned ? I mean there's no blood right ? I spent an hour today watching gameplay on YouTube. I saw other ""players"" being killed/bludgeoned to death by pickaxes. This was hits over and over and over and over until the person killed vanishes into some light beam, which I guess makes it alright. This is such an extremely violent game. There's only one thing that matters in this game, it is to kill. I'm not some dweeb parent that doesn't get it. I play games myself. Some of my adult violent games, actually all of them, have less violence that this game. Many of the adult violent games you still have to figure things out - this is just straight up killing - executing. I believe you get bonus or something for clean head shots. How about this instead - parents. Spend some time with your kids instead of parking them infront of the game console and let them kill for entertainment. Also to have any meaningful gameplay you have to be hooked up and able to online chat and listen to other players, this is live. No filtering before your kid hears it. If you dont set up the game properly your kid might be chatted up by Uncle Fester.

And now it’s impossible to get. 
Is anyone else annoyed by this? Because I know I am.
Maybe even if they put it in the item shop so only people who played when it was in the game can buy it for a fairly large amount of money?
I know it’s a battle pass item but still it’s really annoying to me.
I wouldn’t care if they released it to everyone and compensated the people who got it from the battle pass with another music disc too.

First of all, you need to know that epic didn't make only one game which means they are experienced devs and know what they are doing. Prior to making Fortnite epic released a game named Paragon( i was a big fan I remember watching myth stream that game ) and let us just say it went horribly. At the beginning it was going well it had a rising player count and it was pretty good since epic would focus on making the game better before adding new content. Then it got to a point where people would want to leave because there wouldn't be anything new. So Epic had one choice which was listening to the community and do what they want but there where consequences to this. Every time they would listen to the community a small portion of the community would hate their choice and leave the game. Epic didn't enjoy this and wanted Paragon to succeed so they rebooted the game new map new, card system and everything else different which was a huge mistake. They solved what half of the community wanted but the other half left the game. Epic decided to shut down the game as they were losing too much money but they still wanted people to be able to play the game so epic released all the aspects for free. With the launch of Fortnite save the world wasn't nearly as successful as they would have wanted so they release a free to play Battle Royale mode. Fortnite quickly started growing. It was good at the beginning (like with paragon) and then they knew they had to add new stuff so the game stays alive so they did they also started adding cool ways to unlock skins and stuff like that. The game became big and they started making big changes (Battle pass) by introducing seasons which would mean that at a certain moment they would add a shit tone of new content and keep the game fresh. But then, people would start getting mad at Epic for adding bad stuff and they knew they could only make changes if the entire community agrees to their choice. But if there is the smallest of chances to upset people epic looks for a better solution which takes more time but the entire community likes it. They don't want to upset anybody they want to make everybody happy and give the community a game they can enjoy. All in all, I think people should start trusting epic more epic is an experienced game company that knows what they are doing. Honestly even tho I'm sad they shut down Paragon I think epic as a company is very smart and good.",FortNiteBR

That metal seems to be part of the ""U.F.O"" in the lootlake digsite, which means it has to be HUGE.

You can spend all game farming and looting and then get shot in the toe and die. Minis are relatively easy to come by but big shields and slurps are pretty rare. Ive had plenty of games where i dont get a single one so im stuck at 150 health and i get sniped in the body at the end of the game. Think about it like this. A pro player is fighting a decent player and a newer player with a heavy sniper is in a bush somewhere. The good player is trying to replace a wall and the newer player shoots his heavy sniper and hits him in the toe. The pro player has been going for kills all game so he is only at 150 health. Now the new player easily got a lucky shot on the pro player and killed him. Heavys are stupid. I have no problem with the structure damage but body damage should be like 125.,FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/onjwswggqqs21.jpg

I, personally, am 80% certain that leak is fake. First of all, Epic has stated that all Battle Pass skins will be exclusive. Giving everyone the skins is just going to make previous owners mad. Second, cycling through seasons 1-9 is just going to make Epic seem lazy, and would cause tons of backlash. Add that to the fact that OGs won't look like OGs anymore, and tons of players will leave the game because Fortnite will become stale. If Epic has any sense whatsoever, this leak is 100% F A K E. However, I could be wrong. If so, this game is on the fast track to being abandoned, and nobody will shed a tear.

And I haven't even mentioned how unlikely it will be to get skins based on not only Star Wars and Star Trek, but Mass Effect as well. Epic hasn't released a single licensed skin, so why do you think that they'd just toss in three whole skins from three different franchises in the same Battle Pass?

One last thing, how did this person get this information? I saw this ""leak"" was from 4Chan. Why would an Epic Employee, or any leaker for that matter, post on 4Chan, when they can just as easily post on Twitter and Reddit, which I assume has significantly more users, and is supported by Epic themselves?

I'm not trying to rant here, I'm just saying that, if you use a little bit of logic, you can figure out the validity of this so-called ""leak"" pretty easily.

But please, if you think otherwise, let me know. I'd like to hear your thoughts. As I said, I could be completely wrong, so if you think I missed anything, feel free to reply and let me know.",FortNiteBR

Normal modes are supposed to be the “causal” mode, and with Siphen the normal modes were no longer “causal”. It was no longer who could survive the longest and be #1, it was about who could get the most kills, a deathmatch in a sense. 

Epic was right about players being too aggressive. Keeping it in Arena is what they should do, aggressiveness is meant to be in such a competitive mode.

After they mixed the lobbies between PS4 and Xbox One was when the games I played started to become more competitive. This is just my opinion, but I feel as though the lobbies should not be mixed to keep the more competitive players with each other and the more casual players with each other. Or, they could add a crossplay PS4/Xbox One option if you want to play mixed. That’s just what I think, so if you have any reasons, tell me.",FortNiteBR

(On console),"Let’s be real, some people build and edit so fast that your game can’t even comprehend it and you’re dead before you even realized what happened. 

The most annoying thing anyone could ever do is that ridiculous edit window, close it, edit to the other side, etc. essentially making 30 different edits in the span of 5 seconds where one again, is moving so fast that your game can’t comprehend it. 

Folks are editing at a ridiculous rate now and it’s pretty much impossible to keep up. I’ve died to people who are editing *so* fast that their body isn’t even moving/they’re not making a triangle shape/right angle to make the triangle edit, they’re so quick that it looks like the edit just appears without them moving. 

It gives most people an unfair advantage IMO and it’s also annoying as hell. Being able to edit fast is essentially a product of your internet/having a good controller. You can win gun fights and build battles if your internet is slower, you can’t defeat somebody who’s an edit fiend without being at the same speed as them. They’ll open a window, shoot you in the head, and close the window all before you can even see the window open. IMO, the game really needs to slow down in that regard.",FortNiteBR

Since the very beginning of this game people have improved at building by an insane amout and basically 90% of every game is full of good players.

It's also very, very frustrating and very, very hard to get good at. I play for several hours everyday but still I usually die within a minute after landing. I usually get 0 to 3 kills in the beginning but then I'm done. I can have a full legendary weapon setup, it does not matter. Killing more than 3 people happens like once in 50 games. I'm kind of bad at building even though I've practiced it in playground for many hours. There's not much more I can do except quitting my job to practice and play for 10 hours a day. I won't do that :)

My little brother plays on Xbox One S. I have my edit as touchpad at the moment but I used to have it as circle (the equivalent of ""B"" on Xbox controllers.) I was able to have my edit and confirm as circle on my PS4 controller but on Xbox you can't have B as edit and confirm. I then put my Switch Mode as triangle (Y equivalent) and then put my pickaxe as Right on D-Pad and just got rid of squad comms. 

This seems to be an Xbox issue since I've seen PC players using an Xbox controller be able to have edit and confirm as B. On Xbox you can only have 1 or the other. I don't know if it's a bug or on purpose.

Another thing I would like to point out is that on Xbox there is a display bug where it says ""Unbound"" for a controller bind that is in fact already bound to something. I've seen another Reddit post where reinstalling fortnite fixed the display bug that is too much of a hassle to keep reinstalling the game when there is a visual glitch.

There is absolutely no way anyone will scroll all the way down on twitch to find a random streamer. This is literally a direct way to market yourself. If you outplay someone and you have ttv in your name you at least have a chance of them going to look you up and getting eyes on your stream. If you have no way to get people to see your stream there is no way to grow.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that the first thing people think when they see ttv on the screen when they get outplayed is ""REEEEEEE TTV BTW"" (I am guilty at times too) but most of the time I will go and check out a ttv player if they outplay me just to see what their reaction to the fight was or to see how they do the rest of the game. A lot of times if they aren't toxic and seem like a decent person i'll give them a follow too.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

**Rare Skins (1200 v-bucks):** More detail, more accessories. Might have an extra style. Comes with backbling

&amp;#x200B;

**Epic Skins (1500 v-bucks):** Different player models, might be reactive or have different styles. More unique and more detail

&amp;#x200B;

**Legendary Skins (2000 v-buck):** Completely different from Rare or Epic. Should have an extra style or be reactive. Cool animations as well.

That is how i think a skin's rarity should be based on. It would make Epic and Legendary skins much better. What do you think? :)",FortNiteBR

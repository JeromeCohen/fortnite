Well I didn’t want this. I understand epic wanted multiple ways to play the game but destroying the shotgun meta and creating the godly meta of smgs was never the way to do it. Elevating one meta way above another has ruined this game for me at least. I tried to play with a great friend of mine who I haven’t seen this summer but we just don’t have fun on this game. This recent nerf of smgs hasn’t done a thing. Sure they don’t beat ARs anymore but shotguns aren’t anywhere in the meta. Building the main thing in this game isn’t in the meta. I love this game and I will still continue to play it but I just don’t have fun like I used to. Epic has created a great game but currently they have started to cater to the less skilled players way to much. You can say a good player can adapt and I have but where’s the fun in spraying down other people. In fights requiring little skill. Double shotguns was better. The original double pump was better. These were things that could be countered. But with the addition of the smgs this isn’t a counter able meta. It dominates everything. I go through this sub and see all you great players and plays. I watch these clips and enjoy them but when I go to play this game myself I just can’t find what made this game what it was.
         I’m sorry for ranting but I just needed to say something. I have been lurking for so long on this sub. I understand there is an epic please spot but tell me how this will get much attention in an endless sea of comments. If you’ve read this far thank you truly.",FortNiteBR

Whether it’s pumpkin launchers, new awesome skins or cool items like the ATK, it always manages to make me excited about the game.
I have spent so much money on this game and honestly have not regretted it, until now.
The current meta right now is nerfing building (to help the people who aren’t as dedicated toward the game) and buffing rocket launchers and explosives and several SMG’s. The amount of times recently where I have gotten killed by someone who uses nothing but rockets and P90’s is severely disappointing at this point. There are people out there who are incredibly dedicated and have been playing since the beginning, but have since then lost motivation because of how every patch is hindering the skill gap and their skill. It’s honestly so disappointing that this game has turned out like this but I believe there still can be a way to fix it.
TL:DR, please nerf smg’s and change rocket launcher drop rates or structure destruction please.",FortNiteBR

Don’t give me bullshit about how epic is a good developer that listens just bc of the good necessary change of nerfing SMGs. Because, epic reduced floor mats, and severely nerfed mats from llamas, pretty much taking away what made them good but so rare. Everyone wanted the gameplay to be FASTER, but epic decided to go against the community and make it SLOWER, since i don’t want to spend over half my game whacking trees. This is why I play less fortnite or go to tilted, bc of how long it takes to harvest mats. They wanted “less build battles” but come the fuck on! That’s what makes fortnite special!! What they should do: buff mats you get from harvesting by 25% and remove floor mats. That way you get mats faster, speed up the game, and give more space for other guns or loot.

And now? They fucking nerf health of buildings, making it so noobs can just spam and have a good chance. While it’s nice that SMGs got nerfed, they’re still going to shred buildings, along with every gun in the game. Again, this is removing the unique building of fortnite, since fortnite even has the word FORT in it! Catering towards noobs and removing skill gap. 

What was once one of my favorite games is getting worse. (End rant)",FortNiteBR

But then I looked at the item shop, and holy fuck. 20 dollars for one costume! I'm a Splatoon player, and I recently paid 20 dollars for a high quality DLC campaign that included tons of content along with several exclusive costumes. Some people said it was overpriced - I just tell them to look at Fortnite!

I guess the thing that bugs me the most about it is, I have some disposable income and I WOULD spend lots of money on the Fortnite item shop, but I just can't justify the absurdity of 20$ for a single costume. If the prices were more reasonable (maybe 10 to 12$ at most for legendary items) I would spend hundreds on this game. But as it stands, I can't in good conscience spend any money at all.",FortNiteBR

With season 2,3 and 4 you could easily identify it but this season is so random. I’m mainly just writing this because yesterday instead of purchasing the season like I intended I just purchased the Bright Bomber. This just made me realize how little I care about this season because I found it so disappointing.

For example, if edit was R3 (right joystick button on PS4) you could just switch the “reset edit” button to circle. 

Then repair could be switched to left on the D-pad.

And to all PC to players that are going to say just switch to pc because “pc master race”, not all of us have the funds for a gaming pc and I’d rather not go out and buy a kb+m when epic can just fix this by remapping a a few buttons.

I think we can all agree that we've seen one too many 'Search Chests in Unpopular Location' challenges. However, most of the posts complaining about the challenges fail to bring up their own suggestions. I'm making this post because I share the belief that the Weeklies are becoming a bit stale, but I also have tried to make my own challenges.

Now keep in mind, I am by no means a game designer or anything. I'm just trying to get my ideas across. Maybe you agree with some ideas, maybe not, and that's fine! If you have any criticism or feedback, or just have some ideas of your own, feel free to post them. 

Without further talking, here are my (current) Weekly Challenge Ideas:
**Have an item of each rarity in your inventory. **
Self explanatory challenge. You will need to have a Gray, Green, Blue, Epic and Legendary Item to complete this challenge. It's almost like a scavenger hunt!

**Search 7 Chests in unnamed locations.**
Since there are so many unnamed locations out there (Containers near Retail, Superhero Mansion, Viking Village), I feel like this would be a less frustrating challenge to perform in comparrison to finding chests in a place like Junk Junction.

**Walk X distance in a single game.**
Just walk lol

**Take no damage for X amount of time.**
Maybe a very uninspired and easy challenge, but I feel like it would work to try.

**Bump into a player with a vehicle.**
Seems stupid and risky to do, which makes it so fun! Just hop into an ATK or Shopping Cart, and start acting like you're a battering ram seiging a medieval city.

**Use a Spray in 5 different named locations.**
Easy to do, more fun than finding Chests, whilst still making you go to different locations.

**Stay Airborne for 10 seconds. (does not include jumping from the Battle Bus).**
A little bit more difficult to do if you can't find Jump Pads or Rifts, but still managable.

**Visit 3 different Moai Heads.**
Honestly, I'm surprised we haven't had something involving these things yet, so it was about time.

**Jump into the same rift twice.**
Yes, it is in fact possible to use the same rift twice. Just hop into one and go straight down, and you should be able to jump into it again! It's not a hard challenge by all means, but not everything should be a chore anyway.

**Nail a landing with a shopping cart or ATK with a distance of at least 15m.**
We'll finally get to utilize the various ramps around the Island, and I feel like it would be a lot of fun to try. You can always increase the distance if 15m is too easy.

**Survive at least 100 points of total fall damage in a single game.**
Nothing too spectacular here. Just take a lot of fall damage, heal yourself up and do it again.

**Successfully traverse Loot Lake.**
The most impossible challenge, awarding a measily 5 stars as is usual. Jokes aside, this would probably be a proper challenge as people really like shooting at you when you're going for a swim.

**Collect a total of 1750 materials in a single game.**
One of the most suggested challenges out there is to collect 999 of every material. Since getting 999 metal seems like too much of a chore, I decided to make it so that you need to have a combined total of 1750 Materials. So, the sum of Wood, Bricks and Metal need to equal or go over 1750. 

**Visit the exact center of the island.**
Honestly, I don't *know* where the middle even is. But this is the internet, and it'll probably be on there somewhere.

**Destroy 3 trees in 10 seconds.**
Again, not very difficult. Just bring them all down to 50 HP, then knock 'em all down!

**Stick a Clinger on a person 3 times.**
Not on the same person of course, you can do it on different people in different games. Just stick 'em with the plunger and watch them run whilst you rake in those Battle Stars.

**Deal 2500 Damage to the Ice Cream Truck in Dusty Divot**
Maybe if we make a challenge of it, they'll break it for once!

That's all I have for now. Like I said, any feedback or ideas are welcome.

We kick and/or ban players and machines based on the game being modified / tampered with, cheat software found running while playing Fortnite, and other ways of cheating.  so after that i said well what did i do because I've never cheated ever in fortnite because it will be unfair to other players, and it will make the game no fun.

so epic responds saying "" Bans for any reason are not issued unless they are rightfully warranted. For this reason your ban will not be overturned.""

Everytime as gun was introduced it was ok we tested it for a day back to shotguns, might as well have called it shotgun royale. The only people complaining about change is the one that realise how bad they suck as soon as one little thing changes they cant win anymore or even get kills, learning how to use new guns is how you get skillful not only using a op one hit kill gun that's now skill at all and anyone trying to learn too bad for them cause they died before they had time to react, this game is a fucking beta i know most of you don't think that because most of you don't think at all, but it is and all betas go thru change, changes to this game is going to come whether you like it or not, just because you little entitled asses think you are the majority and want your way and its fuck what everyone else thinks that's against it in any way or form, well guess what this small 800k sub reddit is not even 1% of the overall player base so before they listen to your bitching ass they go look at the actual in game numbers and stats from the other 150 million people before making a change to something.

Unfinished and to be updated..

Before reading I would like to state this is unfinished and will be updated upon me getting time.
(https://imgur.com/gallery/HQTSb0H This is only for the “thumbnail”)

I had an interest in researching all this for the past 4 days from u/shadukengames. (He was the OP of the moai intersection post.) As curious as everyone else is. I had took it upon myself to research most of what I believe to be the story and conclusion of season 5. 

Please take all of this with a grain of salt. I do not want to come off as crazy. I do not know if I am even on the right trail. Take caution, as I am also only on my phone and, can not make the post look half decent. Their are so many questions that are still unanswered. I am posting my findings as unfinished. As I work 2 jobs, totally 14 hours a day and do not wish to have this continue to take up all of my free time. This is all in hopes of the community to help add more information to this post. If you guys can think of anything significant from previous seasons that corollate with my info. Please do not be frightened to be wrong, this is all a discussion and will be until proven otherwise. 

All of my information is almost directly correlating the themes of this season or partly helping the narrative. 

Their will be a lot of direct links between these different points in time. Their are also some things I am speculating extremely. I will state that info, probably at the bottom of this post. Maybe it makes sense, maybe it doesn’t. 

*Popcorn Emote*

Their are 7 MOAI heads currently in the fortnite map. All of which where found to be facing in one direction near Salty Springs. (found by a reddit user ShadukenGames.)

“These MOAI heads are carved from compressed easily worked volcanic ash or “tuff” found at a single site of the extinct volcano “Rano Raraku”. “

Looking at each MOAI head you can distinctly tell them apart from their facial features to their hats or “puako”. 

“Pukao are the hat-like structures or topknots formerly placed on top of some moai statues on Easter Island. They were all carved from a very light-red volcanic scoria which was quarried from a single source at Puna Pau.”

As from what I can remember.  I have seen some of the moai have a Pukao. I do not know for sure of what is exactly on the heads, as of right now or what they could mean.

From what we know so far these heads are links around the rifts for the most of them that is. Not all rifts spawn directly near moai’s. They spawn near or around areas effected by the crack in the sky. Places that included are the Viking village, sand biome, durr-burger, noms sign, etc. 

To me it seems like this is where mana plays into how + what the rifts are, the storm, drifts pink aura, maybe  the crack in the sky and possibly the pop rocks.

“Many archaeologists suggest that ""[the] statues were thus symbols of authority and power, both religious and political. But they were not only symbols. To the people who erected and used them, they were actual repositories of sacred spirit. Carved stone and wooden objects in ancient Polynesian religions, when properly fashioned and ritually prepared, were believed to be charged by a magical spiritual essence called mana.”

“Mana, in Austronesian languages , means ""power"", ""effectiveness"", and ""prestige"". In most cases, this power is understood to be supernatural.

According to the POLLEX Project, a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for ""mana""—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-""—existed in Porto-Oceania, the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, ""mana"" means ""thunder, storm, or wind"" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant ""powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own.""

Could the reason be to unlocking the aura at a high tier, could this coincide with drifts “prestige” and “power”?
Is the storm a supernatural agency?

Going into the moai placement and why they look inland. 

“Archaeologists believe that the statues were a representation of the ancient Polynesians' ancestors. The moai statues face away from the ocean and towards the villages as if to watch over the people. The exception is the seven Ahu Akivi which face out to sea to help travelers find the island. There is a legend that says there were seven men who waited for their king to arrive.”

Why are our seven moai looking inland and not out to sea? Could their be more moai coming in later weeks?
Who is their king?

With talks of a king, mana, and moai history. Some of the story is making sense. You’re right it’s not for the most part.. so far. We know that moai are related to mana, which correlates with the storm, rifts, and drifts aura.

“The quarries in Rano Raraku appear to have been abandoned abruptly, with a litter of stone tools and many completed moai outside the quarry awaiting transport and almost as many incomplete statues still in situ as were installed on ahu. In the nineteenth century, this led to conjecture that the island was the remnant of a sunken continent and that most completed moai were under the sea. That idea has long been debunked.”

A lost continent?

Moving onto where I believe the fortnite map is set and how it was put together. Also of what is to come of the season and it’s end. 

The sunken continent is called “Mu”.

“Mu is the name of a suggested lost continent whose concept and name were proposed by 19th-century traveler and writer Augustus Le Pongeon who claimed that several ancient civilizations, such as those of Egypt and Mesoamerica were created by refugees from Mu—which he located in the Atlantic Ocean. This concept was popularized and expanded by James Churchward, who asserted that Mu was once located in the Pacific.”

This is where I first found the first mentioning of Egypt. 

“The mythical idea of Mu first appeared in the works of Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), after his investigations of the Maya ruins in Yucatán. He claimed that he had translated ancient Mayan writings which supposedly showed that the Maya civilization of the Yucatán was older than those of Greece and Egypt, and told the story of an even older continent.

This is also where I began to think if this continent is older than Greece and Egypt. Would they have been settled by descendants of this land?Both of which to me are most notable “worlds” that are apart of this season.

Le Plongeon actually got the name ""Mu"" from Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, who in 1864 mistranslated what was then called the Troano Codex using the de Landa alphabet. Brasseur believed that a word which he read as Mu referred to a land which had been submerged by a catastrophe. Le Plongeon then identified this lost land with Atlantis. and turned it into a continent which had supposedly sunk into the Atlantic Ocean.” .....

Atlantis! The maps sinking?

“Le Plongeon claimed that the civilization of ancient Egypt was founded by Queen Moo, a refugee from the land's demise. Other refugees supposedly fled to Central America and became the Maya.”

“Churchward claimed that Mu was the common origin of the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Central America, India, Burma and others, including Easter Island, and was in particular the source of ancient megalithic architecture. As evidence for his claims, he pointed to symbols from throughout the world, in which he saw common themes of birds, the relation of the Earth and the sky, and especially the Sun. Churchward claims that the king of Mu was named Ra and he relates this to the Egyptian god of the sun, Ra.”

Going back to the 7 moai waiting for a king, is Ra the king? Possibly being our road trip skin? This would further connect Egypt to mu, to Ra.

“Churchward attributed all megalithic art in Polynesia to the people of Mu. He claimed that symbols of the sun are found ""depicted on stones of Polynesian ruins"", such as the stone hats (pukao) on top of the giant moai statues of Easter Island. Citing W.J. Johnson, Churchward describes the cylindrical hats as ""spheres"" that ""seem to show red in the distance"", and asserts that they “represent the Sun as Ra.”

Further connecting Ra to the Moai and their Pukao’s.



 Extreme speculation

Pointing out where the Viking village is at. It’s is located at the tallest peak on the map. Reading into Norse Language, I had came across the word snaefell. 

“Snaefell (Old Norse, snjœ-fjall/snjó-fall - snow mountain) - (Manx: Sniaull)[1] is the highest mountain and the only summit higher than 2,000 feet (610 m) on the Isle of Man, at 2,037 feet (620.9 m) above sea level.”

https://imgur.com/gallery/z3agk1H
If you corrolate the Isle of Man and the location of snaefell with the fortnite map. It almost lines up perfect with the edge of the island and where the mountain is. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/hjNsIeG
I am willing to believe that a volcano May in fact becoming to the map as well. As this is the extreme speculation I was mentioning above. I can’t remember the OP of the volcano concept, but it may be true. Looking at the geographical map of the Easter Island. Lining it up with the NW corner of the map, it almost fits perfectly. This island also being home to the moai. It has a volcano that would be near junk junction and now mysteriously vanished soccer field.

https://imgur.com/gallery/UkXLbdS
As these are not direct interpretations. The map of mu and Atlantis are both of the same origin. I have no idea if our map is modeled after either of these. It really seems like it is and I don’t know how with all the evidence so far points to this.

I would also like to point out the pot
Of gold(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifröst) and Ragnarök. They are the  97th and 100th battle pass tier rewards. As these are both references to Greek and Norse Mythology.

https://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/anubis.html

“During the Ptolemaic Period Anubis became associated with the Greek god Hermes as the composite god Hermanubis. Hermes was messenger of the gods, while Anubis was principally guide of the dead. Hermanubis was some times given attributes of Harpokrates. He was worshipped in Rome until the second century and was popular with Rennaisance alchemists and philosophers.

Priests wore Anubis masks during mummification. However, it is not clear whether the Anubis mask was a later development influenced by the Osirian myth or whether this practice was commonplace in the earlier periods too”

Why not just impliment a crouch cooldown like csgo uses?  The building changes are continuing to cater to a lower skill cap and honestly when was the last time the community ever ASKED for building to be nerfed? Squad games seem almost unbarable if the team is slightly good because anytime you have a man disadvantage they spray Tommy guns and SMG's at anything you build and just burn your mats until you die. Theirs pretty much zero outplay potential now if your low health against someone who is much higher and of equal skill. This game since I started playing it in Season 2 has just kept getting worse and worse since about mid season three. I think the developers are chewing off a lot more than they can handle, they release game changing patches once a week, and expect everything to be polished, but instead it always comes out half assed and it seems they're more concerned with the map than the actual gameplay.

He’s at 30 health I drop down hit him another two times and just get one shot this is just luck based. The heavy shotgun is to rare to be this powerful some people think that making a weapon rare balances it. But making it rare actually makes it stronger because only a few players have it these are the players you see at end game. So to rest my case please epic consider either buffing the pump and tactical again the tactical is in real need or nerf the heavy to where it no longer one shots to give better players their earned better chance at winning.",FortNiteBR

A few small tweaks and changes to snipers could put them right back on top WHERE THEY BELONG.

1. Headshots should do 15,000 damage. Overkill you say? I want my opponent to feel and remember getting headshotted for the rest of the week.

2. Headshotted opponents don’t get knocked. Once they are domed just close their game and give them a probation for letting their team down.

3. Body shotted opponents shouldn’t be able to build for the rest of the game.

4. If you hit an enemy over 200m you immediately usurp all of their season xp making them start over at level 1 (including battle pass tier).

5. Heat seeking ammo for knocked players. No sniper god can live down the infamous “point blank whiff” when they attempt to exterminate an opponent. To solve this they need to add heat seeking rounds. Shooting your sniper down into the ground immediately kills all knocked players on the map.

6. After hitting a bounce pad and completing a 360 degree spin, all players on screen immediately die and have the replay of their death played as their loading screen for remainder of season.

I was even a fan when they wanted to reduce building so that each fight stopped becoming “who can build the highest”.

But unfortunately they took both ideas to the extreme.

Shotguns now are just unusable. I mean a grey pistol is deadlier than a pump or tact. 

Building is too weak. Players just charge your build and empty one of their 5 smgs into your build (tact SMG, silenced SMG, p90, drum gun, mini gun, heavy machine gun etc.)

And worst of all AR’s have become absolutely random. Prior to the end of Season 4, I learned to fire an AR to the point I could laser players by using first shot accuracy and controlling bloom.

Season 5 started and I noticed a lot of my AR shots would miss, both close range or long. Rarity didn’t really make a difference. I chalked it up to RNG and bad luck and figured it would balance it.

But a few days into season 5, I knew something was def wrong. When I shot at players in open terrain my billets would just “dance” around the player. It seems like the game HATES awarding kills via AR. I could land my first 4-5 shots and miss my next 25. 

Meanwhile the bloom became absurd since it would expand massively. So I am not sure what an AR is even good for now a days.

In duos and squads when you peak out to take advantage of an opponent mistake you need to capitalize before his buddie(s) take advantage of you being out of cover. Now I feel like opponents can make TONS of mistakes because RNG is giving them a pass. There is less strategy. 

For those of us who are familiar with EPIC, we know how the original Gears of War multiplayer started off and how it ended. Epic ended up making that game so RNG and implementing so many changes that it destroyed the competitive landscape and the game in popularity.

Unfortunately it seems Epic is striving to make this game too fast paced and too noob friendly it seems it is taking the same path that Call of Duty and Battlefield series did.

And now with news of a sniper rifle that can SHOOT through walls, makes you wonder what the end game is here?

All of this is going to eventually promote MORE camping as teams AVOID firefights because the RNG makes it pray and spray based.

TL DR;

Recent changes too extreme
Shotguns unusable
Too many SMGs/rapid fire guns 
Building nerfed way too much
Too many explosives
Pray and Spray the new META
Assault Rifles suck

I really do believe they have our best interests in mind, they’ve proven themselves very responsive to the community which is not common in many games currently.

     What I wanted to bring up is the state of meta because of the addition of so many viable submachingun-like weapons and the massive nerfs to shotguns and building. This is my opinion and I really just want to hear what the community thinks about it.

     I believe the meta mentioned in the title above was the most enjoyable meta for the following reasons.
1.  I think the shotguns are far more skill based since they revolve around who can get off the better shot while at the same time attempting to keep yourself defended from your opponent/opponents. In the sub meta it’s almost impossible if more than one person is shooting to do anything besides box up. Creates a much campier playstyle where it’s almost impossible to engage a team without getting melted from medium-close range
2. That medium-close range I talked about is now where most fights are decided. It used to be a sort of dead zone where you might be able to pop off a bit of damage is now the red zone where it’s become very difficult to get into build fight and shotgun range
3. The actual shotgun fight was much more technical as well. When you heard your opponents shotgun go off if you were still alive you knew how much time you had to make a decision essentially allowing you and your enemy to participate in a sort of chess game of peaking, editing, shooting and walling just to mention a few small interplay’s that happened during a fight. The fights now seem to be one of two things. Spraying whole your enemy spams walls or spamming walls while your enemy sprays at you. You don’t have that time in between attack’s and defensive plays anymore and you can’t be sure of the opportunity cost of making a move since the bloom could be godlike or useless by you or your opponent

    There are many more points I could go over but I feel like these sort of lay the groundwork. Again this is just my opinion but it seems to be shared by the majority of players I’ve spoken with. Would love to hear some feedback on your opinion on the comparison of the two metas :)",FortNiteBR

I would imagine this: Player opens server, server connects to a master ""indexing server"" which would assign it a CMM key, which people can then use to easily connect to the server. The indexing server would, ideally, also provide an anti-cheat layer for the sake of protection. Of course, this could also be done on the server/client itself, as it's likely already done. Also, epic, if you do this, please for the love of god don't make initial setup a hell. I'd like to host a server on linux, so, say, i should be able to download prerequisites for the server with apt, download server files with wget, unpack them and then start the server into a solo game on my local network with a single script. That's probably a bit much to ask, but i think you get the picture. Something else then, a config file. Ideally, a config file is set up with a bunch of parameters i can change. For example: 

-max amount of players

-private (need key)/public (shows up in server browser)

-autostart(starts when filled up with players)/manual(needs to be started by admin) 

-gamemode (ie TO20, 50v50, sandbox, normal)

Of course, fun options should be there too. Like rarity of specific items, material multpliers and maybe loadouts. Things like this would give people the freedom to play fortnite how they want to.

It's terrible when an enemy team has a mountain fortified and the circle falls on them. Most likely the team below is going to lose. However, with the new circle, it might make things a bit more even, which I do like.

However, I find that 9 out of 10 times that I've ended up in the moving circle situation, the winning team won because the other side died in the storm. It's a terrible way to lose or win. Also, the  new circle can sometimes cause even a larger disadvantage if it falls behind or next to the enemy team. Now you have to rush past the team with a deadly storm behind you, while trying to avoid explosives and bullet fire.

I'm not really sure how they can improve this, so I thought I'd start a discussion to see if anyone has any thoughts. Maybe slowing down the circle might help, making a larger area to move while trying to get to the new area. Or maybe the way it is now is just the best solution. 

Let me know your thoughts.",FortNiteBR

• Must be played in squads of 2-4, one member of each squad will be assigned the role of “president”, with all remaining members assigned as their bodyguards.

• Aim of the game is simple, win the game with one small twist; if your president dies, the team is instantly wiped. 

• Presidents are given max health and shields, alongside a golden hand cannon upon entering the arena.

• Supply drops will be much more valuable within this mode, as a “bodyguard supply drop” will enter the map rather than usual supply drops. When opened any bodyguards that have already been killed will re-spawn into the game with a basic loadout. 

The idea of this mode is to promote teamwork and co-ordination in order to win the victory royale. Playing defensively to protect your president is crucial, as is playing offensively to take down the opponents president to win the fight.

Let me know what you guys think!

So I wanted to buy the skin the next day for the backbling, but when I logged in I only had 600 V-bucks left. 

I looked at my Inventory and noticed that I had skins I didn't buy, e.g. Red Knight, also some emotes and a pick axe.
My Battlepass level was also way higher than when I logged out.

Then I noticed that I ""bought"" every new item in the store that came out that day until the v-bucks I had left weren't enough to buy anything that was left, even though I wasn't online at all.

I wrote a ticket, got an automated reply and nothing else (this was 3 weeks ago).

I then noticed that I couldn't find my Omega skin anymore and the backbling was also gone.

Somebody also changed my ingame settings, but not a single match was played.

(Patch v5.10),"I saw a post earlier today on the r/FortniteCompetitive subreddit saying not to use Wood anymore, and that it is completely useless after v5.10. It was an alright material comparison and analysis, but it was still partially flawed, since using the average by simply dividing the growth by the seconds taken didn't give the actual growth rate.

So, here's my analysis, after some Playground testing:

**Walls**

Wood: 9 HP every half-second, until the last half-second, it fills in the remainder. 80 to 150 HP, final remainder is 7.

Stone: 10 HP every half-second, no filler because there's no remainder. 80 to 300 HP.

Metal: 9 HP every half-second, until the last half-second, it fills the remainder. 80 to 500 HP, final remainder is 6.

Essentially, **Stone** is the most effective **Wall** material until 12.5 seconds have passed, which is when **Metal** overtakes it and becomes the most effective, despite growing slower in HP. **Wood** is as effective as Metal until 4 seconds have passed, which is when it stops growing in HP.

Summary: **Stone is viable** if short-term (under 12.5 seconds), **Metal is viable** if long-term (over 12.5 seconds), **Wood is to be avoided.**

**Floors, Stairs and Roofs**

Wood: 9 HP every half-second, until the last half-second, it fills in the remainder. 75 to 140 HP, final remainder is 2.

Stone: 9 HP every half-second, until the last half-second, it fills in the remainder. 75 to 280 HP, final remainder is 7.

Metal: 8 HP every half-second, until the last half-second, it fills in the remainder. 74 (not a typo) to 460 HP, final remainder is 2.

Essentially, **Wood** (alongside Stone) is the most effective until 4 seconds have passed, which is when Wood stops growing in HP. **Stone** is the most effective until 13 seconds have passed, which is when Metal overtakes it and becomes the most effective, despite growing slower in HP.

Summary: **Wood is viable** if very short-term (under 4 seconds), **Stone is viable** if short-term (under 13 seconds), **Metal is viable** if long-term (over 13 seconds).

**In conclusion...**

**Wood** is **viable** for **build fights**, since the structures used there are used to take highground over the opponent, not to have a reinforced structure. **Stone** is the most balanced material, as it is always the **most viable** for both **build fights** (in fact, more than Wood) and **ramp rushing**, and it still has a fairly high max HP which makes it **partially viable** for **long-term structures and bases**. **Metal** is by far the **best** for **long-term structures and bases**, such as 1x1 bases or big squad forts.

Wood isn't useless, and since it's easy to farm, take it when you can, it'll be very useful in buildoffs. Stone is the best overall, so prioritize both farming it and using it. Keep some spare Metal for bases.",FortNiteBR

You can calculate what % of the player base you are better than with your win rate and k/d ratio.

**BACKGROUND**

There was a post on the front page today yesterday about mid-tier players. A lot of people were quoting their win rate and K/D in the thread and saying that was evidence they were mid-tier. A lot of people then disagreed, for example:  

* I have 4k/d and 15% win rate and am Mid-tier
* Dude that's top tier if anything!

So people have an implicit idea of their ranking in the community based off their win rate and K/D. And most people could probably eyeball a win rate and k/d and have a feel of how good this player is. But can we determine where they rank by percentile in the community from just win rate and K/D? If we can do it intuitively I felt there must be a way to do it formulaicly.

**DERIVATION**

I assume there is a normal bell curve distribution of skill in this game. I then assume a random person you encounter is an average person. The chances you encounter someone better than average cancel out with the chances you encounter someone worse than average. 

The first step was to get a measure of encounters per game vs. encounters WON per game, based off of K/D and win rate. If you have a K/D of 5 and a win rate of 20% that means over 10 games you die 8 times so over 10 games you kill 40 people. That's a total of 48 encounters. The equation for this is: 
 
* (1 - winRate) * (1 + killDeath)  

Don't ask me why it works it just does...

Then for encounters WON per game it is just:  

* (1 -winRate) * killDeath  

So for our hypothetical person with k/d of 5 and win rate of 0.2 we get:  

* Encounters per game = 4.8 (hey that's the same 48 from above!)  
* Encounters won per game = 4 (hey that's the same 40 kills from above!)  

So this seems to check out...now we can estimate how many encounters an individual has per game and how many of those they win. You will note I don't factor in dying to the storm and I don't factor in bailing on an encounter also there is no way to measure how you loot, but I figure all this evens out in the long run.

From there we can determine a probability for winning an encounter. It's just Encounters Won per game divided by Encounters per game.  

* Probability of winning an encounter = Encounters won per game / Encounters per game

Then I steal the concept of Elo which is great for predicting results of head to head matchups and ranking people relatively. It comes from chess (and thanks to /u/adamrgisom [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/2y6ezm/how_to_guide_converting_elo_differences_to/)). The probability of winning a game against an opponent is:  

* P(A) = 1/(1+10^m ) where m is the rating difference (rating(B)-rating(A)) divided by 400

Going back to my above assumption we are assuming everyone you encounter is an average player. I then peg the average Elo at 0. So the m in the above formula just becomes (-Elo/400). It's negative Elo because we are considering person A in the above example and I'm assuming B is 0.

This is the probability of winning ONE encounter though. You ought to be credited for experiencing more and more encounters per game. So I then raise this formula to the number of encounters to game. This has the effect of multiplying the encounters out because a game is not just one encounter. You have a lower chance of surviving your 2nd encounter simply because you must survive your first to get there. 

Before a bunch of algebra:

* Encounters won/Encounters = (1/(1+10^(-Elo/400)))^Encounters

After a bunch of algebra and substituting original values for killDeath and winRate we get:  

* Elo = -400 * log[e^(ln[(k+1)^) ^/k]/[(1-w)(1+k)]) -1]  

where k = killDeath and w = winRate

Unless you care about the derivation of the math which I hope some do, and I hope some check my work, that formula isn't so meaningful.

**RESULTS**

I did want to see what my formula spit out for some extreme scenarios:  

* Ninja has 0.369 winRate and 11.6 K/D : This gives an Elo of +792
* A potato with 0 winRate and 0.01 K/D : This gives an Elo of -791
* Me (IGN: eaglessoar) with 0.032 winRate and 0.82 K/D : This gives an Elo of +96

That worked out really nicely, I feel like I'm an above average player with my 3.2% win rate and 0.82 k/d, but I know I'm pretty damn close to average. Ninja and our Potato set the bounds. From this we can estimate standard deviation of (Max - Min)/4 = 400. So Ninja is 2 standard deviations above average or in the top 2.5%, which sound about right. Figures are a bit less meaningful at the top end of the spectrum, but the gut check feels right.

So now with standard deviation and a normal distribution we can estimate what percentile player you are. So for me I am 96/400 = ~0.25 standard deviations above average a.k.a. my Z score is 0.25. Using a z-score table this gives me a value of 0.5987 i.e. I am better than 59.87% of the population or in the top 40%.

**CALCULATE YOURSELF**

If you want to do this for yourself, follow [this link](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-400+*+log%5Be%5E(ln%5B(k%2B1\)%2Fk%5D%2F%5B(1-w\)(1%2Bk\)%5D\)+-1%5D+*+log(1.54387344397\)%2F400) and wherever you see K replace it with your K/D and wherever you see W replace it with your win rate as a decimal (i.e. win rate of 20% = 0.2). [Here is what my stats look like](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=-400+*+log%5Be%5E(ln%5B(0.82%2B1\)%2F0.82%5D%2F%5B(1-0.032\)(1%2B0.82\)%5D\)+-1%5D+*+log(1.54387344397\)%2F400). Then look it up in a z-table: [negative z-scores](http://www.z-table.com/uploads/2/1/7/9/21795380/9340559_orig.png) and [positive z-scores](http://www.z-table.com/uploads/2/1/7/9/21795380/8573955.png?759). If you haven't used z-tables before take the row of the first 2 digits and the column of the 3rd digit so my 0.25 would be row 0.2 column 0.05 for a value of 0.5987. The value in this table is the percent of people you are better than, take 1 - the value for your percentile rank. If you want just your Elo delete the part at the end where it divides by 400. I'll do a few with my Excel in the comments if people are having trouble.

**tl;dr:
I came up with a method for determining your percentile rank using just Win Rate and Kill/Death Ratio. If you want to calculate yours exactly look at the preceding paragraph. If you want an estimate go to fortnite tracker, get your kill death ratio and win rate, and look it up in [this table](https://i.imgur.com/1xHegHm.png) that will give you the percentage of people you are better than. Take 1 minus that value to get your percentile rank.**

**EXTRAS**

A note on some of the extreme values in that table: a 0.1 k/d and a 50% win rate is not a realistic scenario in fortnite though we can calculate it in my table I would ignore these extreme values.

Why is 0.01% win rate and 20 k/d better than 50% win rate and 20 k/d? This was an odd result but on some thought I realized it made sense. If our person is only winning 0.01% of games they need to have 21 encounters per game and win 20 of them whereas our person who has 50% win rate only needs to win 10 out of 10.5 encounters. This essentially captures the luck factor of end game, if you are good enough to have 20 kills consistently but still lose you are having lots of encounters but getting unlucky with wins.

Once you know your Elo you can do other fun things like calculate your chance of winning a single encounter vs an average player:  

* = (1/(1+10^(-Elo/400)))  

So for me with an Elo of 96 this is 63.4% chance to beat an average person in an even encounter. Or I'll win 6/10 encounters and lose 4/10.  

* Ninja's chances of killing an average player: 98.9%  
* Potato's chances of killing an average player: 1.04%

You can also see how you would fare against others by using the original Elo formula with your difference in Elo as opposed to absolute. Careful with getting the difference. If you want to know how YOU would do vs THEM take their Elo minus your Elo; vice versa for them vs you:  

= (1/(1+10^(Elo Difference/400))) 

So how would I do vs Ninja? I would take his Elo of 790 minus mine of 96 for a difference of 694:  

= (1/(1+10^(694/400))) = 1.8% chance to beat Ninja if I encounter him

What's Ninja's chances vs Me? Take my Elo of 96 minus his Elo of 790 for -694:  

= (1/(1+10^(-694/400))) = 98.2% chance for Ninja to beat me if he encounters me

O chug jug agora da 100 de vida e 100 de escudo em 14 segundos (eu acho).
E se por exemplo o chug jug desse só ate 75 de vida e de escudo mas era preciso 17 segundos.A vida era logo posta imediatamente mas havia uma particularidade se nós perdemos alguma vida o chug voltaria a dar sempre até a 50 ou 75 de escudo ou de vida.
Por exemplo: Tenho a vida a 100 e tenho 5 de escudo o chug jug e já tivesse sido tomado ele dava 1 hp por 3 segundos até aos 50 ou 75 ambos em vida ou escudo. Concluindo o chug jug se fosse tomado pela 1 vez daria 50 hp ou 75 hp tanto na vida como no escudo mas sendo tomado até ao fim do jogo a vida e o escudo seria recuperado até aos 50 ou 75 em ambos mas seria muito lento.
Total de segundos para 75 hp: 150 segundos (1 hp em 2 segundos) = 2 minutos e 30 segundos.
Total de segundos para 50 hp: 150 segundos (1 hp em 3 segundos) = 2 minutos e 30 segundos.

While trying to ads your target at close to medium range, makes the aim assist so weird. It's as if the aim assist is repelling / moving your crosshair away from the target. FYI: I had the very same problem with the Hunting Rifle before they removed the aim assist from it.

Its gotten me killed a few times now, i just cant seem to move my crosshair to my target body. I do not have any problem with it while hip firing and i do not have this problem with any of the other SMG's while ads.

Now before i made this thread i asked people that i play with and they all said the exact same, that they only hip fire with it up close..

So i was merely wondering if anyone else in the community had this experience or if not aware of it please try it and let us know here.. It really feels like the aim assist is working against the user here and not actually helping.

I dont know if this specific SMG has a different kind of aim assist / mechanic then the others? For the record i have no problem with the silenced SMG on this matter.

Please let me know guys and upvote for it to be seen if you to have experienced this?

I don’t know how often this is suggested in this subreddit (I’m new here and this is my first post), but the LMG probably needs a buff.

I think it behaves how it should do, and this is great (large magazine, great for suppressing fire/destroying buildings, fairly inaccurate/large spread), but it’s damage seems a bit on the low side.

I feel like the reason this was done was so it didn’t become a super fast firing assault rifle. However, due to its inaccuracy and inability to perform at range (effectively/consistently), I don’t think it would ever be a true replacement assault rifle if it were given a damage buff. 

A buff of 1 or 2 damage would be all it needs. I feel 2 would be better, and if this somehow made the gun too good at close range or something (due to the fire rate) it could easily be balanced by increasing the movement penalty on the LMG whilst firing. I know fortnite isn’t meant to mimic real life, but the LMG is a heavy weapon which is often deployed on a bipod to ensure accuracy. I feel if the damage is increased by 2 and the moving penalty is adjusted if it needs to, the LMG will have a place for a squad member who can sit at the back laying down fire whilst his teammates rush the enemy. 

Tl;dr: The LMG has no place in the meta and a damage buff is probably needed, but this can be further balanced if it needs to by increasing movement penalty whilst firing and allowing the LMG to shine when the user is stationary in a suppressive fire role. ",FortNiteBR

First of all i have to say that i didn't expect a sh#tstorm like that for an update. I think you should be more respectful of Epic Games' hard work.
I've seen people calling BR a ""Gold Cow"". That's a game. Games generate money to let the developers survive! (They really exist even out of fortnite! Did you know?).

But i'm going to the point, now that i'm downvoted to hell.

Betweek 2010 and 2013 i played a game called Combat Arms, and i remember there was a Server List to join matches, that included ""Winchester"", a server where K/D ratio was limited under 2.0
I think that this system may work for Fortnite, like a Normal Mode accessible for people whose account level is.. i don't know, like under 30? Maybe 40?

This would make things easier for newbies: playing with other newbies, till they know the game enough to join the real Battle Royale (Solo, Duo, Squads)

Mine has to be [Loeya](https://www.twitch.tv/loeya), she is very entertaining, insightfull, explains a lot of her decision making and game mechanics and is just a cheerfull person. Her chat interaction is also very funny. 

Her [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/loeya)  picked up the pace too recently and there are daily uploads and some fun clip compilations with rather high quality in editing.

So... whos your fav streamerette? Any recommendations?",FortNiteBR

Sometimes people in bases spy you as you’re coming in from the storm and you have no option but to approach them whilst dashing between cover - I feel this would help.

You’d still be susceptible to explosives, and would open the game up to team tactics in duo / squads where someone draws fire deliberately!",FortNiteBR

as of right now I saw a lot of posts regarding the building issues we're facing right now on consoles. Regardless of that I haven't seen any post lately mentioning a major issue I have found with editing on console. 

Editing is binded to the circle key on the PS4, to edit a structure you need to HOLD this key down for maybe 1 second. And I honestly think this is the biggest problem about it. Compared to the pc version, you just tap the edit key once and you're able to edit the structure. 

From my perspective, I think adding an option like (hold to edit on/off) would help a lot. 

Especially in busy build fights it could help a lot. Also in addition to that we need to mind the sluggy movement on console editing as well, which leads to more editing failure than pc players have. This 1 second could be a small game changer.

Epic Games has started going for the competitive scene with huge money prizes, which is good idea for game that has gathered alot pro players.

My concern with the pro scene is that Epic Games patches/""fixes"" almost everything, that isn't ""easy"" or ""fair"" to new players. Many other games that are striving eSports higher, aren't doing this, probably even if they wouldn't have a competitive scene.

This feel really weird to me because it's taking away things that makes someone better player, and every patch slowly becomes a game, where no one aren't considered as a pro.

I contacted epic support and they said ""your account has been banned. All bans are rightfully warranted and cannot be overturned."" And of course I waited 30 days for that shitty response. I responded to them again but they ignored it. I've tried to contact them again multiple times. No response. I spent 250$ on my account and they ban it for no reason and tell me they can't do anything about it.",FortNiteBR

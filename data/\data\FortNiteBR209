 Recently In the new item shop a new outfit has appeared which has been giving me a hard time right now, I have Coulrophobia and theses new outfits are frightening me in every bit, I genuinely dont want to go into games anymore with my own squads because someone might have this outfit, and since its new I now have to wait out until this outfit becomes less relevant for players to use. Please dear lord create a setting to not see a players outfit in-game. I really would like to play but until then its no use right now. And I'm stuck between leaving for a week atleast or trying my absolute best to try and not worry about it.   


 This outfit comes with a variant which I haven't been able to see because I really dont want to, I'm sure its much more worse then what the character I saw was.  


Please epic I'm begging you to add a setting or remove it for the time being!

The teaming on console Solos is actually disgusting. I just went about 5 games in a row when I got rushed by about 5 people at once, because when I'm in the middle of fighting one guy, automatically a whole fucking squad of people want to jump in and vulture my kills or spray me and give the guy I'm fighting an easy kill. It's not just on me either, plenty of times I'm seeing this happen to others, and I always feel bad about it. Like Solos, the FFA mode, seems to have more teams than Squads half the time? Almost any build battle or drawn-out fight results in one side getting lasered by some random other guy who hears a shotgun blast and decides to tunnel his vision like a Brite Bomber to tryharding. Like I'm coming up to 200 Solo wins right now, and I've never seen this mode so toxic as it is now.

Many of you love building because it allows you to feel like Ninja or other big streamers when you run across bad players.

&gt;I've been playing since September last year and I've recently in the past few weeks noticed players all of a sudden getting better and better and with much less noobs and I've been struggling a lot more than before. 

It's possible that the noobs finally lost interest as a result of lack of SBMM and just moved on to other games or only play 50 v 50.  This game desperately needs an SBMM system.

I'm noob skill level since I don't have amazing reflexes, circle strafe jumping skills, or aimbot-like aim.  I hardly play the game much anymore since it became boring, even in 50v50.  Spend 7 minutes waiting for a game, parachuting, looting, see someone and die instantly in 2 seconds before firing a shot.  I imagine myself being laughed at on some guy's Twitch stream.  Lots of fun, right?

Instead I play Rocket League competitive which has a good SBMM system.  I do like shooting galleries and enjoyed UT 2004's Invasion-RPG mod (as well as UT99 and UT2004 in general).  If STW ever goes free-to-play, I'll probably come back to Fortnite and play that.",FortNiteBR

Shotguns are better than ever.,"If you only have 1 pellet that hits, that basically means you missed the shot...

So often I see players miss shots completely and they think that they should have gotten massive shotgun damage simply because they heard the sound that indicates that they hit the opponent...

However, if you slow down replays, the vast majority of the time... people just missed their shots and they start going off about how it didn't do any damage.. I just laugh.

Shotguns are in a better place than they've ever been.

Obviously there are still bugs where occasionally shots just don't register period but they're few and far between and it's not exclusive to shotguns...

What am I saying?  Hit your shots and stop blaming the game.  If your box only allowed for one of your pellets to connect, you don't deserve more than 7 damage.  Shotguns aren't max damage or 0.  That's not how it works.  Hit your shots.",FortNiteBR

May apply to the 256GB version, but I don't know. Epic has confirmed to me in four separate emails that my device is not eligible for the promotion. There is a whole procedure they ask you to follow.  First make sure you are signed into your Samsung account on the Tab, go to the Galaxy Apps, open the Fortnite Launcher from the Galaxy App, play three games and exit to lobby after each game, and then wait 24-48 hours for the skin to arrive. So I sent Epic Technical Support photos (not screenshots) of me performing each step, and I also sent them photos of my receipt, and photos from my devices ""About"" screen showing the model number and serial number.

I received a pretty generic response: 

&gt;"" Hello,  
&gt;  
&gt;Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support.  
&gt;  
&gt;We have reviewed the account you provided again and our records state that a Fortnite game was never played using the device in question. For this reason, we can't assist you further with this matter. 

I asked if he looked at the photos and 12 attachments I included, his response is frustrating:

&gt; I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news but unfortunately, as I stated before, there is no instance whatsoever of Fortnite being played using the device in question. This is the reason why I am not taking your pictures into consideration.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;I suggest contacting Samsung Support...

I can't even comprehend that response, you won't even look at my pictures? I have never heard anything so ridiculous, and so I told him so. I asked to be escalated to a manager, because I believe there is a problem with their system detecting my device. Their system does not seem to be accurate. His final response was:

&gt; I apologize for the frustration you might have experienced but there is nothing further we can do on this matter. I redirected you to Samsung Support previously so you can obtain more information about the device in question. Our records clearly state that an eligible Samsung device was not used in order to acquire the indicated content. 

I'll make the Samsung Support debacle short and sweet, since this post is already dragging out. Samsung's live chat support seemed helpful at first, they confirmed I followed all of the steps I listed above, and confirmed at had a Galaxy Tab S4. They told me there must be some sort of issue, and he would escalate the support call to Tier III support. Tier III support would take 72 hours to respond. I actually thought I was getting somewhere. Three days later I received a message from Tier III support. It was instructions for how to redeem the Note S9 15k V-Buck\\Galaxy Skin Pre-Order promotion. Not even the same promotion or same device.

When I responded, pretty heated at this point. I stated, I couldn't believe I waited three days for an automated response for the wrong product.  I asked to speak with a person live on the phone or get some kind of real non-automated response, and Samsung closed my ticket and hasn't responded to me since.

So my only recourse at this point is to return the device and try to inform people that the promotion is not accurate, and you will not get your skin like this advertisement claims:

[https://samsungpromotions.com/galaxyskin/](https://samsungpromotions.com/galaxyskin/)

Even my device lies to me when I open Fortnite on it:

It looks great when you use it, and up close it sounds really good; great job there EPIC, but I think this emote needs just a final touch to make it great.

All I think it needs is a boost of the sound radius. This means that from a larger distance, as in able to be heard clearly from two different sides of a build battle, maybe. I'm not proposing it gets ear-splittingly loud up-close, but I am proposing it retains its volume when out of the general emote sound radius.

I feel like something as cool as this emote should at least be able to be used for what it looks like it should be used for, and that making it so that nobody around you can hear it from a decent distance unfortunately wastes a really good concept.

Emotes have been changed before; please make this one better than it already is!",FortNiteBR

So you probably don't believe me but I was running random squads on getaway a few weeks ago and we start talking about random things and he seemed like a cool kid so I added him. So fast forward to today I randomly join him for some duos and we start talking about where we live and then he brings up the reason he lives where he is now and starts to talk about a show.

Me-""what do you mean a show""
Kid-""oh I'm just down here for a Netflix show""
Me-""so you mean your in a Netflix show""
Kid-""yea""
Me-""really, do you do any other shows""
Kid-""yea do you know black panther""
Me-(at this point I'm like noway he is in it) ""yea why""
Kid-""Well I'm in it""
Me-""I don't belive you prove it""
Kid-""OK""

So he says to go onto instagram and message him, so I got my sister to message him cuz I don't have it and he fkn replied. So at this point I'm low-key freaking out as well as my sister and my whole family then rushes into my room trying to ask the poor kid as many questions as possible.

For one, it's cool seeing up to 4500 xp after a win. On the other hand, I leveled up 4 times today from 71-75. I feel like this is them handing out the ragnorak skin to people who probably wouldn't have gotten it otherwise. I think that's both pretty cool and also pretty lame, as it gives a ton of people a skin that's supposed to show how you earned it through time and dedication. 

I'm not mad that they're doing this, as if you paid for battle pass you should get the joy of having the skin, but it kinda takes away from the pride in having it (not that I was incredibly proud of being tier 100)

Also, on an off topic note- there should be a skin/cosmetic item for if you complete every challenge in the season. Not just 7/9, but all of them. Get the skin at 7/9, and maybe a pickaxe at 9/9? I completed every challenge and was kinda let down as a new player seeing there wasn't even so much as a banner for doing this. It'd give incentive for players to really grind them all, and would get epic more playtime from players. Just an idea!

I don't think I'm very good at fortnite anymore tbh. I remember one time in season 4 i got 2 dubs in a row and thought i was good, but have only 9 or so solo wins. I can build well (as in double wall floor ramp rush that tfue does all the time) but it feels like i can't keep up with half of the sweaty streamers. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

I left for a week on a trip and came back this evening and fired up my PS4. It asked me to login which I thought was weird and upon launching BR I saw my account was at level 1 with all of my skins and progress gone. I did some searching on the ghost account issue but that isn't it. When I logged into my account someone changed my display name to something different than mine and when I tried to link my PS4 it told me my account was already linked to another PS4 and there doesn't seem to be any way I can unlink it. When I go to connected accounts nothing is connected so I can't unconnect this person from my account.

As we know in the week 10 loading screen, the Bright Bomber could see into a dark world. I think why the cube melted into loot lake is to prepare the portal to this dark world. What will happen next is that the Runes will send beams to Loot Lake and activate the portal, causing things to come out of the Portal.

The season 6 trailer MIGHT be Drift and his friends, coming to loot lake. Then the runes will activate the portal, which coincidentally, Bright Bomber falls into the portal. She comes back as Dark Bomber, bringing stuff from the dark world with her.

This is what I'll think will happen with Loot Lake. I've been thinking about this for several days. If I'm correct, please call me god. (JK)

Every other spot on the map, places like retail, etc are absolute ghost towns. I'm lucky if I get four player to land there with me.

Because of how little players drop at other locations, it's difficult to find anyone in mid-game and it is really boring alot of the time.

This leads to one of the worst parts, because of everyone not having anyone to fight, when players see a build off or hear gunshots, practically everyone rushes to it to get some action. So there is either a cluster of players fighting each other at once, or you have a fight with another player and then they come in waves like it's COD Zombies.

John Wick/Skull Trooper: I'm going to die. 

Rust Lord/Zoey/Drift/Sun Strider: I'm about to get into an hour long sweaty-ass tryhard build battle. 

No-Skin: This is gonna be a high kill game, boys. 

But are there any skins that are such a mixed bag that you have no idea what to expect? 

For me, it's most of the ""furry"" skins.  

Whenever I run into a Bunny Brawler or a fellow Tricera Ops in the wild, I'm not sure what to expect, but it's going to be one of two options. 

1. Some kinda random ass goofy ass emote shenanigans or other assorted troll behavior. 

2. A super skilled player that I probably DIDN'T see until they sniped me from 200m away and my screen changed to their pov.

Lag- I'm not really sure what happened from the summer skirmish until now, but the unplayable lag seems to be back. With 50 people in a very small circle, the constant rubberbanding is horrible. Several people actually died in the storm NOT from people but rather they just couldn't move. This is something that needs to be addressed ASAP.

The spectator mode- I understand that the reason they most likely changed from direct streamer's POVs is because they don't want an angry or ""toxic"" reaction to a death or something along those lines. However, it is also laggy. It seems to jump around constantly, nothing near to actual gameplay. Also, there is also health delay making it hard to understand what is actually happening from time to time. 

Cameraman- Yes, I know you cannot show everyone at the same time, however sometimes they just continue to show people who are camping in a 1 by 1 missing all of the action. When the storm is moving I don't want to see someone turtling, I want to see the fights that are going down. Its apparent that the camera guy and casters are not on the same page.

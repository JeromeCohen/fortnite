1,theomega_kappa,1540419563,9r4ckq,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9r4ckq/make_battle_royale_great_again/,1,Make Battle Royale Great Again,@Epic: the addition of zombies and deployable gliders should be limited to the LTMs. Imagine 100s of zombies in a Pro-Scrim or Fall Skirmish. Even in a normal fight it becomes impossible to distinguish zombie footsteps with player footsteps. Also becomes confusing when players wear dark skins amongst many zombies. Even damage to players is confusing when many zombies are around as I become unsure of how much health my opponent has. This may be the worst update to date.,FortNiteBR

This update has been the most fun I've had in awhile. When the game started getting really serious and competitive, it lost a lot of its fun and charm for me. Part of the thrill was getting out there and surviving, no matter how you did it. As the game has shifted towards a more competitive mindset, I think it's lost a bit of what made it fun in the first place. This is obviously just my opinion, and I know this post will either be ignored, or lots of people way better at the game than me will call me a scrub, but I absolutely love the variety the husks brought back to the game. Being in the final circle and having to worry about great players AND zombies is really fun. Thanks for the great update. :)",FortNiteBR

Now I don't mind spending up to 2500 vbucks on the pickaxe, but seeing as the ghoul trooper or the scythe haven't been found while data mining kinda gives me the impression it's not coming back. Now it's not just this, *wink* *wink* I also.. kinda... Made a bet with a friend that it would come back and thought it would come with the skull trooper but didn't, and now I'm getting a lot of anxiety.

You can no longer test your skills 1v1 against another person without getting mauled by cube monsters. You can no longer revive teammates in the middle of a battle without getting mauled by cube monsters. You can no longer test your build skills against another players without it getting torn down by cube monsters. On top of that, you no longer run any type of risk by building a sky ramp. In the past you could shoot someone down for building that high, not anymore. Might as well go ahead and vault the launch pad because what’s the point? Nobody will take fall damage anymore. This isn’t Call of Duty: Zombies. This addition makes no sense in battle royale and is ruining the game for a lot of people.

However, forcing some of these changes on players who do not wish for these new gimmicks to affect their gameplay was the wrong move in my eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The weird PvE style thing Epic has settled on that rewards you shields is completely damaging to the game. After the early game skirmishes, many players need to find creative ways and play strategically to stay alive if they are unable to find shields after the early skirmishes. Sure, it does not leave a lot of room for counter-play if you are caught, but it serves as a reminder to early skirmishers that sometimes the fight isn't worth taking. However, now with the ""Husks"" (I don't know what to call them, I don't play STW), shields are essentially free. I see big shield pots popping out of those guys nearly constantly, with minis scattered as well. With a squad, getting full shield in a minute will be an absolute breeze, ESPECIALLY if the crossbow does 4x damage, a silenced weapon that will not draw another squad's attention. This also encourages control around the corrupted areas, which is restricting and unhealthy. Yes, the Husks damage you if you don't kill them, but I don't believe they do damage to structures and you can just build up and take control of an area with free shields.
2. I am wondering why in the world were bouncers even removed from the game if something like glider redeploy was even being CONSIDERED for addition to the normal game modes. I can only assume that bouncers were removed because they allowed for easy escape from high ground without much penalty to the player who used it, plus giving launch pads a little more mobility. However, now that we can FLY WHENEVER WE WANT, this completely defeats the purpose of the removal of bouncers and absolutely destroys the skill ceiling of the game. Oh sh\*t, I'm really high up and the building is held up by one thing? NO BIG DEAL, I'LL JUST SOAR AWAY NOW! This is the change that pissed me off the most.

Make Fortnitmare a separate gamemode and let the people who want to play the game as it is play the game in the normal queues. If normal queues don't return soon, I likely won't be playing much of Fortnite at all for the duration of this event.",FortNiteBR

Decrease damage done per trap to 100-130, please. It should take more than one hit to knock someone who has 100 health &amp; 50 shield. 

&amp;#x200B;

Risk vs reward when using them is non-existent unless you're trying to play a close game (trying to put someone into a trap box). But since trap placement is near instant &amp; placing two close traps is easy, nerfing spike trap damage to 100 or 130 would still result in a box of death.

Setting it to 100 per trap would remove trap kills if you have used one mini-shield. Setting it to 130 would ensure that you must drink two minis or a big shield potion to survive. 

If you guys think the damage should remain at 150, please let me know why you think so.

But after this update im positive that i lean more towards disliking fortnite as apose to liking fortnite.

I get that this game is for casuals, epic doesnt give one damn about the competitive side of fortnite (even tho they have 100mil in tourny money). But still, how can they just completely change the entire game from one day to another? adding zombies to the MAIN mode is retarded to say the least, makes no sense, why isnt it in a seperate gamemode (or why not just get fucking STW if you want to fight zombies). Now you get hit, blocked and distracted by even more random factors in the game, if bloom wasnt dumb enough now you have npcs that hunt you down. Not even an hour after the update i already saw posts on reddit about how zombies ruined someones gameplay.  


My other main issue is the fact that every mode is now not only zombie mode but also soaring..... wtf... welcome back skybases? are you a bot at building and dont know that you have falldamage? well youll survive anyway bc now you can just glide. if camping and barrelstuffing wasnt enough (p90, smg, doublebarrel shotgun) now you can just camp high up in the air, jump down on someone who is fighting zombies, stand in his face, and shoot fucking once with doublebarrel or shoot for 1 microsecond with p90 and he is dead.  


I dont care wether or not you like the zombies or crossbow or the soaring part, its retarded no matter what way you look at it. My patience is almost done with this game, i love this game and have been sticking with it for close to a year now, but changes like this? were they legit havent thought about anything and just stirred everything up in the blink of an eye, makes me lose all faith in this game.

The redeployment height in my opinion is far to low and makes spam gliding too prominent. An increase in height requirement from 3 ramps high to ~5 would make it much better.

THERE ARE ZOMBIES EVERYWHERE. The fact that they’re there isn’t the problem; it’s the amount of them. I don’t want to worry about fucking zombies in the middle of my 1v1 for a VR. And I don’t want to have 2 cubes spawn on top of me and swarm me with these stupid ass creatures while I’m farming and healing up after a fight. The fix for this would be to stop the cubes from randomly spawning around, and reduce zombie amount in general by roughly half. Maybe have more around the corrupted areas where they should have been limited to in The first place.

I’ve stuck with this game and supported epic throughout their countless fuck ups but this is the first time In a long time I’d rather watch Netflix or play another game then Fortnite in months which says a lot to me.

NB! Rant ahead!  


The new update just completely butchered the game i spent 500+ hours trying to get good at.   


They should've implemented the WHOLE thing as a LTM, not something that is going to affect tournament games and regular games. Sure, its only during halloween, but hey I cant play the game like this. I dont want to rather. The zombies is nothing but annoying and a free source of goodies for mindless, more casual players. 

I completely understand if the majority loves it, because obviously the majority of players are playing the game casually and doesnt care at all what happends. 

But for the rest of us, can we accept this? We wont they let us play the same game we played yesterday? The game we actually enjoyed and tried to get on a competetive level ahead of the solo and duo cups. 

  
I cant even practice for the cups in the state the game currently is.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd like everyone to just state their opinions, and hope for some backing. Because in my opinion this needs to be reverted ASAP. Also im sorry for typos/poorly formulated sentences as I wanted to get this of my chest as fast as I could.

I think Fortnite should add a utility slot that will hold things like the jetpack so it will not take up space on the main item bar.  They will be items that can be used without being selected and will basically act as a passive ability.  They could also add more of these items and only allow players to hold one of them.  This could be a fun LTM and eventually work its way into the actual game modes.  These will be items you find on the map and can equip them.

Some items they can make and put in the Utility Slot are:

Jetpack: Already in the game and with this it will not take up a spot on the main item bar anymore.

Wingsuit: This would basically make your character able to jump and behave the way they do in Soaring 50s.  

Sticky Shoes: This would allow players to run up any surface without needing to build.

Double Jump:  Allows the player to jump twice.

Heavy Hitter: Makes the Harvesting Tool deal much more damage to players and structures.  Maybe 50 damage per hit on players and 60/120 on structures.

Silenced Shoes:  All movement sounds are quiter than normal.

Thirst Quencher: If someone tries to kill you while you are down, they will take half the damage they deal to you as white damage (The damage will ignore shields and just affect their actual health).

Cant Thirst This: Once you are downed you cannot take damage but you are unable to move from where you went down.

Sprint Faster:  Players can sprint faster than normal but will slowly gain speed until they hit the maximum speed.

Lifesteal:  You heal for 10% of the damage you deal.  

Adrenaline Rush:  When you get two kills within 5 seconds, you reload and run faster than normal for 10 seconds.

Quick Revive:  Have the ability to let more than one player revive you.  You would still need a total of 10 seconds of reviving but it can be split up between up to three teammates so you could be revived in as quick as 3.33 seconds.

Hoverboard:  (This one is stolen straight from STW) Allow the players to summon a hoverboard that is faster than sprinting.  You have to wait 5 seconds to summon it and you cannot build or shoot while riding it.

Exploding Body:  When a player dies, they will explode dealing damage to structures and players around them.

Come At Me Bro: Have a huge beam of light on your location at all times that can be seen from everywhere on the map (Basically just a ping that follows you around the whole time).  It will also show your location on the mini map.  There is no reward for having this.  You will have a fun round with people always coming at you.

1. Make gliders 1 or 2 shot destruction. That way it's not a complete way out and a good marksman can take the escaping person down. Also this adds the decision ""shoot at him or follow?""

2. Make gliders not deployable unless you actually jump. So if you get your ramp shot from under you then you cannot deploy

Also, they drop way too much high rarity loot. Chug jugs, rift to go's and heavy shotguns are just a few of the many items that theses AI \*\*frequently\*\* drop. Every player will have maximum health and shields, making every encounter bland and boring. To add to this, you can simply escape the fight due to the immense drop rate of rift to go's from these husks. Even if the player doesn't have a rift to go, they can just jump off any tall structure and glide away now - a mechanic that i'm sure no one asked for. The fog is also an unwelcome addition - say bye to any long range snipes/scoped AR shots.

&amp;#x200B;

Im sure that we all know what direction Epic is heading in.

I made a post maybe an hour ago where I complained a bit about the event, how the matchmaking times are so high and how the Zombies are ruining my game sometimes. I agree that my post was unnecessary, and I was told to “stop whining”

When I talked about a golden Zombie that appeared in my game in a later Zone (you can see the Zone in one of the attached photos), everybody told me that he was very easy to kill with a smg if you hit some headshots, and I was told to “get good”/”learn to aim”.

Now I just wanna know if anybody else has seen one of those golden Zombies. In the first photo, you can see the Zombie and his HP-Bar after giving him 4 headshots with a blue pump and firing a whole magazine with a golden P90 (I hit maybe 50% of those shots into his head). As you can see: it didn't lose HP at all! The second photo with the Zombie is later in the game, after this thing followed me up a mountain and I fired several more magazines at him. His health still didn't get lower whatsoever.

If you have seen one of those as well, were you able to kill him and if yes how? How did you deal with him?

Thanks for reading my post,

Jogius.

2. No fall damage so once they have the rocket launcher or double barrel you basically win.

3. Falling from 3 stories into a glider is ridiculous. I’m getting dived on. There’s no point building as the will just fly down at you + zombies dropping your building... 

4. Basically building isn’t viable anymore other than building up to fly into someone. 


I can see a lot of people not enjoying this me included.

This seems to be coming as a surprise to quite a few people that Epic would make this decision, but we should keep in mind that this is only a test for a week. 

It seems to me that this is going to eliminate the point of fall damage completely. This is going to completely change the style of how build battles go, there is no longer any consequence for building as high as you can go as fast as you can, which is ultimately going to give you the advantage in any fight.

Although, I think that most people are looking past the fact that this is going to only increase the speed of this already fast-paced game, which to me is a plus. It’s going to keep those slow-moving games that you might have from being AS slow. 

A nice counter to no fall damage is how vulnerable fleeing players will be on a glider, just laser tf  out of someone if they try to fly away.

This is going to be an interesting week, I’m curious to see if the community turns around and decides that they want this permanently added. This community seems to flip flop on topics a lot just sayin",FortNiteBR

People like my self really didn’t enjoy the soaring gamemode(s), and I really don’t want to play playground, or disco dom while I wait for the soaring aspect to be gone from regular play.

Wouldn’t it have been better to create Solo Soaring, Duo Soaring and Squad Soaring playlists to see how these gamemodes would play out in the long run *rather* than putting the soaring aspect in to regular play?

I understand that this isn’t temporary (potentially could be though, but I doubt it), but this won’t do the game any good what-so-ever. This is a massive change, and we’ve seen how **massive** changes can kill Battle Royale shooters in a matter of **seconds**. I’m looking at you H1.

I don’t think this ‘test’ is a good idea. It definitely won’t kill fortnite, but it’s going to put player morale in to the grave.

**Suggestion:** If epic wants to try this out... Rather than adding this in to regular play, make playlists separate from the regular playlists for people that prefer to soar around.

Would like to hear peoples opinions on this move by Epic. I for one do not agree with it, at all.

Hang on hear me out.

-build fights- Build fights would be majorly affected by this change because if we have the ability to redeploy our gliders the would be no tactical advantage and no point in build fights, this is because for example the person with the low ground has the ability to go ""fuck this shit I'm out"" and glide off meaning that no actuall build fights would occur because of this which would change the game dramatically. 

-The storm - The storm may as well not be a thing at this point if you have materials because you can just build a high ramp and glide to the storm which affects the game flow and rotations which could potentially slow down the game, this is because less people would run into each other if everyone is rotating zones via gliders.

-Sky bases- Last but not least we have sky bases the bane of my existence. The redeployment of our gliders would make sky bases a golden opportunity to outlive people and stay alive till end game, this also would slow down the game because multiple people would be in the sky because they know they have the ability to glide away if shot down meaning rotations would be affected also.

However there is a solution to this problem, we could only have the ability to redeploy our gliders 3 times per match which would prevent most of these problems listed above. Also along side with this it would still make lainchpads a viable option in game also meaning people do still have a way of escaping battles if needed.

Shockwaves will no longer be used as a boost to clear some ground to get out of the storm or to throw at the floor of your 1x1 to get to your opponents 1x1. Now you can just glide out of the storm or glide over to your opponent.

Rift to go was a great method to escape the storm now there will be on use for it other than to res your duo teammate for a quick escape.

Chillers...my favorite item in the game(/s) will be vaulted shortly after this update. The only way chillers were useful is if you needed to outrun the storm. Don’t give me any bs about “I use them to make people fall off a build”. No you don’t and quit trying to bring life to a dead item. Lots of streamers drop them lol.

[redeploy](https://imgur.com/gallery/6PbeERZ)

In my opinion, this is an absolutely TERRIBLE idea. I'll mainly be talking about competitive play, as that is the direction I think Fortnite is heading in. All strategy with placement, rotations, and any movement based mechanic will be completely mitigated. Utility items like Rift-to-gos, launchpads, and shock nades are currently held as extremely important and possibly game changing utilities that change how that player plays. For example, if you are on the opposite side of the storm, normally you would have to rotate sooner to be sure you make it to the zone in time. With a rift-to-go, you can wait as long as you want, or rotate normally and save that asset for a later time. If this glider re-deploy mechanic is introduced, not only will it nullify all fall damage (leading to insanely exaggerated highground with no punishment or risk), but those items that introduce strategy into the game will take a huge hit.


That's just my two cents on the matter, but I'd love to hear the community's opinions on it.",FortNiteBR

# Pre-Season 3

Before Season 3 began the world of Fortnite Battle Royal wasn't very eventful and there was nothing even resembling a story. Whenever anything in the world or game was changed, it either just suddenly appeared or adversely, disappeared from the world. Take a look at Tilted Towers for example; what was originally just a blank area on the map with nothing of notable interest, suddenly became a sprawling epicenter of most of the activity in Battle Royal. With nothing hinting at it's appearance. It wasn't and then suddenly it was... now, compare this to everything post Season 3 and you will find a distinct difference in how Battle Royal presented its ""story"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Season 3

Once the Comet appeared in Season 3 it set off all kinds of alarms and set many things in motion that remain a staple of the entire game. While the story of Season 3 was nothing like what was to come, there were some elements that showed up then that are still present even to this day. When the Comet started to become a big deal and the community began speculating as to where it would crash land into the world, Tilted Towers became a topic of debate. It was still ""fairly new"" and despised by parts of the community for being too well placed on the map, having too much good loot, and causing the quick deaths of up to 50% of the lobby in the first 5 minutes. Due to these kinds of discussions, Epic had couches and telescopes appearing in Tilted Towers on rooftops to watch the Comet gradually grow larger as it got closer to the world. In the end signs on these buildings shared their love for both the Comet and Tilted. When the Comet became a Meteor and crashed into Dusty Depot turning it into Dusty Divot, Season 4 continued this storyline.

&amp;#x200B;

# Season 4

When Season 3 ended and Season 4 began, many changes in the world and how the story was told took place; for starters, Season 4 had a theme. While Season 2 had a theme of ""Knights"" and a general ""Ye Olden"" vibe, Season 4 had superheroes. This theme, whether you loved or hated it, made the entire season more cohesive as a whole and helped tell the story in a very detailed and organized way as well as being appropriately fitting to the general child-like ""goofiness"" Fortnite has. The superhero theme is something everyone can get behind while also being unique to a point by differentiating it from seasons past and future. In terms of the physical changes the world took on, Tilted was damaged by a meteorite, as was Risky Reels (a brand new POI), the Motel, and most notably of all, Dusty Depot which was now re-branded as Dusty Divot with a new government base at the center studying the Meteorite that had crashed. A new movie set appeared in the Moisty Mire, and a Hero Base was constructed just south of the Lonely Lodge whilst a Villain Base was carved and constructed into the mountain overseeing Snobby Shores. Over the coming weeks the map received constant changes that one could argue, kept the game quite lively; construction vehicles went across the map, breaking down and rebuilding the demolished offices in Tilted Towers, filling the craters at the Motel and Risky Reels, even fixing the movie screen and later playing a fan-made film on it; all the while black cars with construction trucks went around collecting Hop Rocks and bringing them to the Villain Lair for some unknown reason. With each week that went by, we received a deeper look at the story going on in the background thanks to the weekly loading screens that each told a piece of a puzzle. To understand what I mean by this, have a look at the loading screens yourself:[ Week #1](https://imgur.com/143KXiR),[ Week #2](https://imgur.com/svcVcKJ),[ Week #3](https://imgur.com/UHFHfcG),[ Week #4](https://imgur.com/eSaUqrr),[ Week #5](https://imgur.com/FCOlCjr),[ Week #6](https://imgur.com/2rnXdmt),[ Week #7](https://imgur.com/z8uWg4c),[ Completion](https://imgur.com/hfS6XAL).

&amp;#x200B;

Each week has its own name and each name and screen tells you a part of the larger story. Week #1 (A.K.A Quiet On The Set) gives another look at what was happening when the Meteors fell. Week #2 (A.K.A At Last I'm Free) shows that the meteor from the first week that hit the prison had also allowed Omega to escape. Week #3 (A.K.A A Looming Threat) once again tells players that Omega escaped and as a matter of fact is at large and has yet to be located by the heroes. Week #4 (A.K.A Retribution) gives you Omega's motivation and shows that after his escape, has worked towards amassing a large robotic army to help fight the heroes of the world. Week #5 (A.K.A Showdown) depicts the large scale battle at Tilted Towers that occurred between Omega and his forces against Carbide and the other heroes. Week #6 (A.K.A That's A Wrap!) shows everyone that every event from the loading screens has been part of a movie production... until now; where you can see the shadow of the Visitor behind the rocket atop the Villain Base. Week #7 (A.K.A The Visitor) shows that the alien has finally broken out of his pod at the center of the Meteor at Dusty Divot and that he is not part of the movies, he is real. The completion loading screen (A.K.A Retrofit) shows the Visitor now at the rocket in the Villain Base, fixing it and turning it into a functional rocket. This does an astounding job of setting up the amazing live rocket launch. The rocket launched on June 30th and left everyone with many more questions than answers and wanting to know where exactly Fortnite was going to go from there.

# Season 5

Whether or not you liked the superhero theme of Season 4, it was a strong and cohesive one that told you exactly what you were in for. Heroes and Villains of great power potentially battling for the fate of the world. Season 5 on the other hand, had ""Worlds Collide""; which is such a generic, non-specific title that, especially after the ending of Season 4, left high hopes in the eyes of many players. The Battle-Pass was a complete mix of different elements and characters from different times and places in history. We had modern day soldiers with vikings; Ragnarok, a god among men and Drift, a completely random spray-artists that wears a Japanese styled mask. Now let's compare this seasons' loading screens to those that are present in Season 4: [Week #1](https://imgur.com/wQLQC76), [Week #2](https://imgur.com/ztIcnCF), [Week #3](https://imgur.com/8h5flNo), [Week #4](https://imgur.com/tZBD94n), [Week #5](https://imgur.com/eae5s5P), [Week #6](https://imgur.com/0Gm0Keo), [Week #7](https://imgur.com/YC7s0zK), [Week #8](https://imgur.com/pvnw5KU), [Week #9](https://imgur.com/GVwSygy), [Week #10](https://imgur.com/EFgKsmo).  


As with Season 4, each loading screen has its own name and we'll go through them one at a time. Week #1 (A.K.A Road Trip) shows us the arrival of Drift into the Fortnite world. He is greeted by Brite Bomber, Rex, and Cuddle Team Leader; Week #2 (A.K.A Fairway Fun) Drift hangs out with his newfound friends at Lazy Links, Week #3 (A.K.A Track Record) Drift and friends race at the new paved racetrack, Week #4 (A.K.A Poolside Paradise) Drift and friends play in the pool at Paradise Palms, Week #5 (A.K.A Blast From The Past) Drift goes on a tourist journey and finds the ceramic dinosaur statues, Week #6 (A.K.A Opening Night) Drift goes on a date with Brite Bomber to watch a movie, Week #7 (A.K.A Signing Back In) The Enforcers come crashing through a Rift, bringing back the Motel Sign from Season 4; Week #8 (A.K.A Tomato Trek) Drift and friends throw tomatoes at each other at Tomato Temple, Week #9 (A.K.A Six Sided Mystery) Drift and friends mess around with Kevin, Week #10 (A.K.A Dark Reflection) Kevin reveals to Brite Bomber her dark alter ego.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 5's loading screens don't work, especially when compared to Season 4. Season 4 held a cohesive storyline that was easy to follow and was open to minor interpretations. Season 5 on the other hand, unlike Season 4:

* Was completely void of Ragnarok unlike Omega's equal presence when compared to Drift and Carbide.
* Had no story aside from Drift having fun with his friends on the island.
* Introduced a character out of nowhere that held no significance to the plot of the story what-so-ever (The Enforcer)
* Raised more questions than answered

One may argue this idea of complete randomness fits perfectly with the theme of ""World's Collide"" given that its a bunch of random elements that mesh together to form a whole, its the theme of the season after all... but that's just the thing. Season 4 works because of its tight structured theme. Everything works together to form a compelling superhero movie narrative with an overarching ""evil"" at work (The Visitor); and with Season 5, a story that is made entirely of bits and pieces of different stories, doesn't go well together. Try to make a puzzle out of four different puzzles. It just won't work.

&amp;#x200B;

Roughly halfway through the entirety of Season 5, the crack in the sky from Season 4 shrinks, shoots lightning at several cacti in a desert until it closed and and spawned Kevin The Cube that proceeded to roll around the entire map, crushing anything in its path, to 3D print seven runes and then ""melt"" into Loot Lake. Thus, kick starting the beginning to Season 6.

&amp;#x200B;

The ending of Season 5 completely lacks the depth and complexity of its predecessors. With the previous seasons' stories, we at least knew where the starting line was. From Season 3 we knew someplace on the map would be obliterated, from Season 4 we knew that we would be dealing with a bunch of weird happenings going around the world thanks to the new rifts. Season 5 left us with... a purple... bouncy... lake... where do we go from here?

&amp;#x200B;

# Season 6

Well clearly the absolute unit decided that where we go from there is up because he created an purple vortex in the lake and completely tore the Loot Lake house from its roots and proceeded to stroll around the map sapping up energy from the runes he had previously placed so he may shoot a beacon into the sky over Loot Lake.  


I'll be honest. There really isn't much I can say about Season 6. It just started about past month and we still have no clue what's going on.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final Thoughts

In summary, this is why Fortnite Battle Royal's story doesn't work anymore. Season 3 had a permanent and lasting impact, it transformed Dusty Depot to Dusty Divot and although it is now overgrown, is a major part of the map and a reminder of both Seasons 3 and 4; its legacy is continued even now with Dusty Diner having been built as a tourist attraction while also functioning as a museum for the history that has occurred here. One could say its an archive of the previous seasons' stories. I mention this specifically because it is important for elements of a story to have important, lasting impacts with consequences; otherwise, the story is stale and people grow tired of the same boring thing where the stakes mean nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I think its safe to say that many of us are frustrated and flat out bored with Seasons 5 and 6 (thus far) because, as I believe, they lack the permanency the other seasons left us with and have even removed the legacy of past season. The finale of Season 3 bore a hole the size of a mountain into the center of the map, one that is still there to this day. Season 4 *broke the god damn sky*; Season 5 on the other hand, while it had brought nothing to the table but seven runes and a purple cube, *also took away the broken sky*, thus removing the permanency that Season 4 had and retroactively devaluing it.   


Season 5 had only raised more questions than it answered:

* Who are the enforcers?
* What is Kevin?
* Why is Kevin around?
* What is he doing?
* What happened to Ragnarok?

As another redditor had recently stated (and god save my soul I can't recall your username), Season 6 is just a continuation of 5. A Season 5.5 if you will, and just as Season 5 had done, Season 6 only raises more questions by completely erasing every bit of ""*story*"" from Season 5 other than Kevin.

* What does Kevin do?
* What happened to Drift?
* Why is he collecting power from the runes HE made?

Season 4 has been the vastly superior season in comparison to any of the others. Not for Battle Pass or shop skins or anything, but for its story.

I’m not sure where else to go, I’ve watched tutorials and read about how to build and everything I could find. I play a lot of disco this season to work on combat and it helps a lot so I’m decent at that and my building is getting to be good.

Almost every gunfight I get into I can hold my own until the enemy starts building a 5 star hotel with WiFi included. I play with friends most of the time and they are worse than I am. 

I don’t know I’m just getting extremely frustrated because the game is fun sometimes until I get outplayed and I know I can hold my own at first but every time I get out built. 

Anybody have any special tips or tricks especially with building that would help me out? Thanks.",FortNiteBR

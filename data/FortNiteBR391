I also can't build for shit , which is....great (although i have been getting better)

I think for me i need tips on shooting and how to position myself in order to kill anyone, i'm not looking for a first place kind of game btw, just need tips on killing people

I feel as though the double barrel should be a one shot on no shields, and two shots on anyone with shield. (Not including headshot multipliers), but it would also not have as much range as the pump, and the spread would be bigger; faster fire rate than the tac as well obviously.

The slug (just imagine a KSG), would have more range than the pump and an ever so slightly faster fire rate while holding one more shot, not having as much spread, and would have bullet travel + drop. Damage? A in between the blue and purple tac.

How many times have you been killed by someone because you‚Äôre playing overly aggressive because you were under the false impression that they were weak or ‚Äúone shot‚Äù? For me, it‚Äôs often enough and I think I thought of a potential fix. 

What if every time you hit someone, above there head  it showed you how damaged that person was when you hit them. This way you at least get a general idea of how weak that person is when they dip behind cover so that your decision to either push them, or build a base is a tad bit easier. You wouldn‚Äôt get to see the health permanently, or in real time. That way people couldn‚Äôt hit you once and know where you are permanently. And people could still heal mid fire-fight and take enemies by surprise. I think the health should appear over the enemies head, for about as long as the hit marker would show on your screen. 

I think this idea wouldn‚Äôt influence gameplay mechanics too much, and would make the game feel more consistent. This would make it so your not taking guesses at how weak (or healthy) your enemies are mid fire fight. I think it would add another level of strategy that players could use, and overall make for an even higher quality feel to an already amazing game.

It's a challenge!!!! It's not supposed to be something that you get done easily. No, there isn't a lot of chests there and sometimes there isn't any. It's not a daily challenge, it can take some time. If you're getting mad and posting rants about how you can't get the chests in a couple games or a single day then maybe you shouldn't be playing a competitive video game that is meant to be challenging in itself

Yeah, you get an advantage while fighting people but you still have to take the chance of taking a pump to the head when you least expect it.  And you also have to fight them in the end.  It should also be noted that the people teaming are not buddies who got in the same lobby, they are random strangers to each other and everyone has the same opportunity to do it.  What do you guys think?

Edit:  This post is about teaming with random people not your friends.  I have never heard of friends planning to team on solo but considering there is over 3 million concurrent players but let‚Äôs say 1 million here.  1,000,000/100=10,000 
So basically if you put in all the effort to try and get in the same lobby as your buddy, there is a 1 in 10,000 chance that will happen.

I made a post about this a week ago but sadly didn't recieve too much help. For the past month my Fortnite has been capped at 60 fps for some reason I can't figure out. What makes me really confused is that the fps counter is listing that I am getting 150+ fps (which is what I used to always get), yet on screen I am obviously getting 60 fps and nothing more. I've tried everything that I can think of, whether it be disabling or enabling vsync, working with the Nvdia driver control panel, reinstalling and verifying the games files, everything. Every other game goes above 60 fps for me so it seems to be a Fortnite only issue. I really don't know how to fix this, and it sucks because Fortnite is my favorite game at the moment.

Expanding on this, Epic could regularly add or remove various attacks that the game might throw at you if you do something random to trigger it. Like dancing at a no-dancing sign. Or running across the map, finally making it to the circle, only to have a piece of the floor become a launcher that shoots you back into it.

I am going to outline the major flaws surrounding the battlepass' challenges and propose ways to fix/change them.

As you cans see if you spend any time on this thread the place has been blowing up with complaints about the Wailing Woods challenge because of how hard it is to open 7 chests in a place which has only 3 chests spawns whilst competing with 50 other people for them. I haven't bothered completing this challenge because I want to play the game, go after wins with my mates, not commit suicide 15 games in a row for 1 tier in the battlepass. 

The problem with these challenges is not solely the difficulty of them, but the fact that it forces you to stop playing the game. To clarify, in a normal game, you drop at Pallet Palace, get lots of good loot and go and snipe the last few people in Tilted. - Perhaps you'll go on to win this game, but for me anyway, it's unlikely. However once you introduce these challenges which make you commit suicide or stop you from playing the game (like the W.W one) it becomes unfun. Who actually wants to spend 15 games dying to unlock a banner only your lobby can see? Or play 3 games landing at a Fox, Crab and Llama. - Although these are slightly more fun because you usually meet some fellow players who you can dance with.

Challenges like ""Eliminate opponents in Greasy Grove / Fatal Fields"" are cool and fun challenges, they make you go to places you might not usually go to and get you to come out on top. We want more of these challenges!

TL;DR ::: We want more challenges like eliminate opponents, use a launch pad, get a kill with a revolver e.t.c.

I promise it's worth the read! (TL;DR at the end)

So last night I was casually playing solos when it got down to endgame. I ended up landing a nice headshot on someone for an elimination and noticed that it was a Twitch.TV name. Out of curiosity, I decided to check out the stream to see if it was big and if anyone had a reaction, particularly the streamer himself. I tuned in, and dropped into chat to tell him that I was the one who got the snipe on him the previous game, and that I ended up winning the game. He was super cool about it and admitted it was a nice shot. There were only about 10 viewers, but I stuck around and chatted for about 30-40 minutes talking about old gaming days, as he used to play Halo competitively and so did I. It was a pretty awesome conversation between the streamer and myself, as well as the few others there.

*But then something awesome happened.*

Salty was nearing the end of the game and came across Ninja, and ended up killing him. It wasn't an incredible kill or anything (Ninja was in a pinch and recovering from a previous fight), but he was pumped nonetheless. He went crazy, and then suddenly his stream exploded into 700+ viewers. He got tons of follows and a few sizable donations after that, including one from myself for being a part of it all. (Note: His initial reaction to killing Ninja was a bit harsh, but he was clearly filled with adrenaline from the kill, and quickly apologized.)

In the end, he was beyond thrilled and you could tell he was truly thankful for getting some exposure on his stream. His reactions to everything were amazing, and totally worth checking out below. I've clipped and linked them in order of events, so definitely take a look! Salty's a great guy with a cool stream. 

It was such a crazy sequence of events that lead me to see this all happen live and I'm so happy to have witnessed it all the way that I did.

I linked these accounts together and then to my epic games account it WORKED!

You can't punish it, it just creates a stalemate or creating a 50:50 close ranged scenario if you are as good a builder as they are.

Does anyone know if the developers plan to nerf building or implement a mode where building is less strong/non-existent? Personally, every pubg player i played with that tried this game and didn't like it has told me they disliked the building aspect as well.

After linking my Twitch Prime to my Epic Games account, I kept disconnecting in-game for a while and all of the existing V-Bucks on my account disappeared but I was maxed out to Tier 100 on my battlepass and I had a bunch of random skins. I thought this is what came with the Twitch Prime Promotion. At first I was surprised because this seemed like one of the most generous promos in any game ever.

I went to bed and woke up right when patch 3.1.0 went live and played a single game of BR. I checked my bank statement and saw that my account was charged $110 from Epic Games so I immediately sent an email to Epic Games regarding the issue.

Another day passed and now I am permanently banned, no reply from Epic Games yet. 

tl;dr
Beware of linking your two accounts together if Epic Games has your payment info. For me, it was my PayPal so wait until they fix this issue because no one knows if they will be able to charge more than $110. Maybe I got lucky and others have been charged in the $1000s.",FortNiteBR

1) It is an easy challenge. You have to open chests, there is no skill required. Just because it is rammed full of people right now doesn't change that. You can literally land open a chest and die and that is 1/7. The number of people going there will lower. Don't think of it as something you just have to smash out and more of a progression challenge. 

2) Having tons of people running around made for some very fun and random play, I can see why they chose the maze.


It really frustrates me to see so many complaints, when it creates such a fun situation. I would love to see more of these chaotic challenges.

Like how entitled is this community to think they can dictate what challenges they get, you would never see it with any other game. The trouble is everybody wants to do them all in the first day.

It's been one day and I already have 4/7 challenges. The wailing woods one is at 3/7. I really don't understand this, we have like 60 more days or something to complete the challenges.

There is no doubt. I‚Äòm not saying Epic is bad for doing that, they do it to make profit which is natural. However, not many can afford the skins since many that play BR are students or just kids who don‚Äòt have an income yet.

Here is my suggestion: Skins almost always have a glider and a pickaxe that is precisely made for that skin. And each of these products cost a lot of money. What about character bundles which contain all 3 (or 2) items of a character (example: Wukong, Dragon pickaxe, Dragon glider) at a lower price than what they would cost if you buy them individually?

Epic would still make a lot of money and people would actually consider buying these to have ‚Äûa complete outfit‚Äú for Fortnite BR. These bundles could be in the ‚Äûfeatured‚Äú section of the item shop and could pop up from time to time.

A few suggestions I could think of is creating a max rocket cap of something like 12 and giving the grenade launcher a separate ammo type, this way it doesn't nerf the GL but at the same time makes it so people might consider conserving their rocket ammo a bit more.

He doesn‚Äôt like ‚Äúgizmos and gadgets.‚Äù Super smash bros? Nope. Turn it off. Call of Duty? Not a chance. Just about every video game was evil in my father‚Äôs eyes: time wasters, pointless, violence inducing, etc.

I picked up Fortnite in September this year and played all the time in college. I loved it so much I brought my PS4 home over break and played in the living room (where video games were previously banned). 

My father entered the room one day with his newspaper and gave me that dirty eye I knew all too well. He just doesnt like the gizmos.

Every few matches, I would catch my pops in the corner of the room ‚Äúreading the newspaper,‚Äù but I could tell he was looking over it, watching the game.

Soon enough, he began to ask questions about the game. ‚ÄúSo is this like the Hunger Games?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow do you win?‚Äù, etc. 

He eventually moved from the chair in the corner to the couch, clearly engaged. He would jump when I was snuck on, do a fist pump if I killed someone, and started ‚Äúcoaching‚Äù me.

The day I got my first win, he exploded out his chair, cheering and shouting. He ran up and gave me a huge hug and told me he was so proud. My dad used to coach me in ice hockey, he wouldn‚Äôt even get that excited about that. ‚ÄúDo it again,‚Äù he told me. 

He started asking me if I could play during the day, even when I didnt want to. I knew he was addicted and it brought joy to my heart to see a game finally captivate him.

One fateful day, we sat down on the couch and I could see my pops was especially thrilled to watch. Instead, I put the controller in his hands and told him to play.

He‚Äôs never played a video game before really, so obviously he was probably the worst player to ever enter the game. But he loved it still. 

He got my little brothers a PS4, but I saw through it. He just wanted to play. 

Over 200 matches later, pops still hasnt had a kill. 

However, every few days he‚Äôll call me telling me how high he placed. We talk about it all the time.

Fortnite made my relationship with my dad stronger than it‚Äôs ever been. I just wanted to say thank you to Epic for all that they‚Äôve done for this community.

He will call me out for being bad even when most games I end up winning them and getting more kills.

You want to be fully prepared to have an optimal chance to loot a chest. To do this you have to be the first one there. Grab a ruler and open your map when you are in the pre-game island. You can see the trail of the battlebus and measure the optimal path to wailing wood. 


**Step B) Gliding**

When you have done your homework and measured the screen like an engineer it's time to fly. Follow the route you calculated and fly towards wailing woods. Be careful for any birds or Glitter Girls flying around you as they **will** headshot you with a pump shotgun (even while flying). 

**Step C) Scouting**

When you are hovering above wailing woods it's important to scout the four corners and the center area. You don't want to disrupt any wildlife while hunting for the sought-after chest. Notice where the chests are and decide which one you want to open. 


**Step D) The Opening**

Open the chest. 


**Step E) A job well done**

Good job! You openend your first wailing wood chest! Repeat step A till E 6 more times to complete this mission.

**Tip:** After some feedback I decided to add a tip: Make sure your map is open in the correct way. Having it upside down will cause you to land at wrong places like Tilted Towers! Yes we are tilted but this is the wrong neighbourhood to be walking alone at night. ",FortNiteBR

My brother and I have been arguing over landing spots the last couple of days, so much so that we aren't playing with each other any more.

He has a handful of wins I'm closer to 10 (we're not very good). He wants to land at places like Tilted and Pleasant Park to get in more fire fights so we can ""get better"" but to me those landing spots means competing for guns, getting chased cause you lost getting the gun and then a quick death with 7 seconds of game play. I prefer to land at the shipping yard or the houses between Tomato and Anarchy to build up, to me I feel I have a better chance of defeating 1 or 2 teams than I do at Tilted and therefore almost guaranteeing me more game play.

He claims all the best players with the most wins land in Tilted or PP and that may be so but I dont think that player will ever be us. 

My questions:

Do you guys have more fun going to the heavily populated spots and getting instant action? or do you prefer landing in the no name places to build up?

Do you have more success end game winning in the heavy populated areas? or Starting off in a no named location?

I wanna know whats more FUN for you and what you find yourself being more SUCCESSFUL at.

Also, what is your average kill number per game and victory?

My brother considers me stubborn and I would say the same about him, must be a family trait.

Help me keep our FortNite friendship together.  

TL;DR Do you have more FUN landing somewhere like Tilted and getting instant action or do you prefer a no named location? 

Are you more SUCCESSFUL landing somewhere like Tilted or a no named location?

But still every one of us has that one loadout which just feels perfect for you, so I'm wondering what's yours?

I have actually two. The first being:

 AR (m4 or scar) + pump + tactical + bolt sniper + meds (shields or medkit).

 This is the one I'm feeling most comfortable about. Then the other one is: 

AR (m4 or scar) + shotgun (pump or tactical) + rocket louncher + bolt sniper + meds.

 This is really strong imo, since you can just build rush anyone, shoot them down with the rocket, and just shotgun them. 

I like the AR for medium to long range control, the shotguns for close range fights and then sniper for picking kills later in the game. I've tried a few games where I didn't have any meds but got maybe a differnt weapon but then if you fuck up a bit it can go bad real fast. 

The one weapon I don't even pick up is the minigun. I feel like it just holds me down and it makes so much noise that I get someone flanking every time I use it. So I guess that's my least favourite gun.

I also like granades, especially before I get a sniper, since I can play more agressive with them, but I feel that later in the game they just take up space. Maybe we can get a granade slot in the future since there are so many new fun weapons to play with.

So yeah, what about you? What loadout is your favourite and why?",FortNiteBR

Hunting Rifle : It's alright, would still rather have a bolt that has 100% accuracy and no bloom.

Deagle : Fun to use, it's loud, but the Pump shotgun is just better overall. 

Silenced Smg/Pistol : Other close range weapons that are outclassed by shotguns.

Crossbow : Very slow velocity, sure it's silent, but Bolt still ranks supreme.

I'd like to see some new weapons added into the game that are viable late game weapons that can replace my Scar, Pump Shotgun, or Sniper.

A semi-auto assault rifle like the Mk-14, or a Purple and Gold version of the Burst Rifle that looks like the Famas. I just don't see the point in diluting the weapon pool with weapons like the crossbow when 90% of people will choose the Bolt Action over that or the semi-auto sniper.",FortNiteBR

Slowly but surely, my bedtime has progressively gotten later and later. Before Fortnite, I was usually in bed by midnight. Since Fortnite, it's now usually around 1AM. 


Rewind to two nights ago. I had just wrapped up playing Fortnite with some friends around 12:45AM. Suddenly, I smelt smoke. I quickly scoured around my apartment but couldn't see any reason anything would be on fire. I scrambled outside to see if it was in my back patio or from a neighbor. Nothing. So I ran back into my apartment to even more thick and billowing smoke. Knowing shit was hitting the fan, I called the Fire Department. Within minutes, they were over here and had to crack into a wall in my closet that housed my water heater. Apparently my water heater had shorted out along with the outlet that it was plugged into, causing an electrical fire inside of my walls. 


The scary part is that none of my fire alarms sounded. Had I been sleeping at my normal sleep schedule prior to my Fortnite addiction, I would have potentially slept right through it and my apartment could have burned down. So, I just wanted to take the time to thank Epic Games for making such an amazing game that, in a way, saved my life. 


Also, I wanted to remind everyone to check your fire alarms to make sure they have batteries and are working properly. Seriously. Do it. It could save your life. 

TL;DR 
Fortnite changed my sleep schedule. Had an electrical fire at 12:45AM. Alarms didn't sound. I was awake because of Fortnite. Fortnite saved my life. Thanks, Epic. (And check your fire alarms). 


EDIT: Definitely want to give a shout out to my local fire department and all firefighters as well. Satire aside, they are the true heroes and I have tons of respect for what they do. ",FortNiteBR

I've seen people doing this despite them being in immediate danger. I'm not sure if people are doing it deliberately to ruin someone's game or if they just don't see why it's bad, so here's some reasons why it might not be such a good idea.

1.  If they got downed that means they have teammates alive which are now probably heading your way, and they could kill you while your aim is on that person you just downed

1.  If you instantly execute one of the enemy team: congratulations, you've pissed that whole squad off and you best believe if they down any of your squad now you're all getting executed.

1. If you don't instantly execute then you now have the other squad at a disadvantage. You have something they want so they are forced to come try and get it off of you. I've noticed this often makes people reckless and easier to kill.

1. If you have one of their players down and they have one of your players down then it's in both teams best interest to keep their respective hostage alive - if they kill your teammate, then you kill theirs as a worst case scenario. 

By all means carry on insta-eliminating people but expect equal hostility back at you, it's often in your squads benefit to keep the enemy alive

tldr: Executing makes enemies mad, more likely to do the same to you and keeping someone downed will often put you in a strong tactical position",FortNiteBR

(Ninja and a couple youtube live streamers seem to agree that bloom makes it a worse sniper). So once again, I'd love any information on when or if they'll be making the weapons more accurate. (Because as the game is right now I've stopped playing it as much. The M4's are stupid unreliable and the only AR with somewhat predictable aim is the burst)",FortNiteBR

Would be fun to race the other top players (e.g.. I'm showing second with 10 kills but the first place player has 11. )  if I passed their count, our places would switch.

It could be a separate store that anyone could access OR it would only accessible once you've reached X amount of wins. 

25 wins - I now have the options to purchase a special winners skin that differentiate myself from others.

As you go up in wins (for this example I'll use 50, 100, 150) you have the option to purchase more rare winners skins.

Now if you're a person with a lot of wins you have the ability to purchase a skin to reflect that and if you're happy with not spending money, then that is fine as well.

I think this would be AMAZING and it would generate money for Epic. I personally don't see any negatives to this idea at all considering they're constantly updating the game. It would also give higher incentives for wins. ",FortNiteBR

I have seen several text posts on this subreddit on about how fortnite is better than pubg. Someone even said that PUBG is dead! Lol, nice joke. Anyways, PUBG imo is more balanced. The PUBG team has patched up many of the early mistakes. PUBG is easily one of the most watched games on Twitch, Fortnite is great, but stop comparing it to PUBG, they are different but I prefer PUBG more because of the first person view, optics, and challenge. Fortnite is more arcadey, and PUBG is more realistic. Not absolutely realistic, but realistic in a good way, as in you can hide in grass, crouch, prone, add optics and attachments to your rifle, and more. In my opinion PUBG has more content so I prefer that. However, I also enjoy Fortnite with friends. it is a great freemium Battle Royale Game!

It's just me telling you my concerns about gameplay and issues. I would like your feedback but I do not need the""stop complaining about the feature that hasn't been released"".

Disclaimer: I know there are man reddit threads about this topic, so linking me to posts and telling me I'm saying the same as others; I know.

I do not want the jetpack in Fortnite BR because of the gameplay that will come with it..... If this item is introduced building will be useless because people can just jetpack up and shotgun you or whatever. Skybases will be extremely annoying because if you happen to shoot it down they can just jetpack before they hit the ground and negate all damage that would've been dealt. The game will turn too much into a game where unbalance is a normal, thd double pump nerf brought back some balance but, if the jepack is release you can just float around in the air, go onto trees, be practically un-snipable to the regular player. The game will tuen basically into a cod game with exo suits and might lose players.

How will we run out of fuel?..... Will it be a timed thing when you touch the ground or arent using the jetpack(like Pharah from OW), or will it be stored as an ammo so that if you eliminate other people that have a jetpack you can get copious amounts of fuel to just fly forever?

Alot of issues and unbalanced gameplay will come with the jetpack, and the game wont be as fun as epic have been making it.

Again one way to solve unbalanced gameplay would be to have a public test server where a set amount of people go to test things that come out, or with every new item have an LTM that has the new weapon/item. This will coat money but imo it is for improving gameplay and balance.

Hope you guys understand. Leave all of your opinions in the comments will try to respond to all of them.

I know a lot of people like it but I feel that for an uncommon rarity gun it‚Äôs ridiculously good and detrimental to player enjoyment, especially players just playing for fun or casually.
Today I was one pumped at 20m from 200 health. In my opinion it‚Äôs not balanced for an uncommon rarity weapon to be able to 1 hit someone at max health from a very reasonable range. At really close range (within 5m) this is more acceptable and makes sense but at a decent range where all other shotguns are basically useless it shouldn‚Äôt be able to instant kill someone. I feel this hurts the game as new or learning players will feel cheated especially if it is their first good run and they are instantly killed.
My suggested possible nerfs:
1. Increase the rarity: just make it a green and a blue pump instead of a white and a green while still maintaining the same damage. This way though still shitty bullshit instakills occur less often.
2. Increase the spread of the weapon, still maintain its high damage but just reduce its effectiveness over a long range
3. Make it a singular or double shot in the clip like the other weapons capable of 1 hitting such as the bolt sniper and RPG
4. Increase the cocking time even more to the level of the deagle so that it‚Äôs really punishing to miss.",FortNiteBR

They've been subjugated to last resort type status for the most part.

What if Epic turned them into poison grenades?  If an enemy is caught breathing in the stink, that player is poisoned for 1hp per second until he/she uses a healing item.  

Shield items do not count.  Only items effecting base health would stop the poison effect.

It might give the combat a little more psychology which is always fun.

What do you think?",FortNiteBR

The tourneys used to go from 5-8pm but now, because of daylight saving time, it goes from 4-7pm. This prevents a large amount of players from taking part due to work / school.

How did Rift and Calamity come to dress similar and other than being different elements, radiate energy from other worlds? Here's my fan theory","Bright bomber &amp; bright gunner were together, bright gunner died during the visitor event, bright bomber welcomed the new player drift to cope with her mourning, upon realizing that her alter ego was inside the cube she and drift began experimenting with ways to stop everything that has happened to the map, they figure out a way to reactivate the rift which specifically consumed bright gunner, drift attempts it despite his selfish temptations to stay because of his love for bright bomber, drift becomes stuck in the past on earth, with bright gunner, they exhaust all efforts of returning and preventing the catastrophe. With all hope lost drift and bright gunner decide to acquire a property that they knew would be transported to the game and they knew bright bomber would visit, they then decide to live out their days and care for the property, leaving a message for bright bomber to bring drifts weapon and his corpse to the location the cube would spawn upon discovery. They both died of old age and were buried out back. *flash back to the fun with bomber and drift* they had found the location and laughed off the mystery because Everyone respawns..but in her mourning since losing the two greatest loves of her life bomber has since retired and nicknamed herself the calamity because of her misfortune. Upon tending the loot llamas one day she notices a rift on the edge of the map and a shadow stone that had flown way out of the direction of any cube wakes, of corrupted zones, but she is tired and depressed and longing for any shot, so she loads up the remains of her deceased lovers, consumes the stone, hits the rift and is transferred back in time to the moment the cube spawns, lightning strikes, the wind howls, all of the cacti are now smouldering piles of dust, the final strike hits calamity, with drift's and bright gunner's remains tucked inside her winged unicorn backpack, suddenly, calamity, drift, and bright gunner were all awake in an unknown vast expanse of ever changing glyphs which they realized was wherever the cube originated from. Drift begins to spark like his weapon once did, he radiates the energy of the cube, suddenly a window opens up, one way glass style, bright gunner notices drift and bright bomber approaching the cube with a group from their world.. he observes the familiar way drift and bomber behave.. their friend in the t rex costume gets zapped by the cube and the window closes, calamity and drift exchange a glance, gunner looks painfully at bomber.. t-rex boy has a glimpse to the disappearance of drift and bomber in strange atire mourning at his grave next to brite gunners, which until now seemed to be a a foul joke. After what's seemed like weeks of restless nights after hearing t-rex boys story brite bomber approaches the cube alone one afternoon. The tortured pause in the air between the trapped trio is interrupted by the window appearing once again and displaying bomber's approach, in an agonizing scream drift starts to no longer be able to absorb the cubes energy, the brite duo rushes to his side but only calamity is able to approach without being zapped, in a desperate attempt to stop his pain and potentially escape calamity grasps drift by the hand and touches the window at the place where brite bomber appears to be touching the reflection of dark bomber.. brite bomber faints, seeing a glimpse of her interacting with the cube during a cataclysmic event. Calamity, in shadow form can feel drifts conciousness pulling her towards a resting younger drift, unknowingly asleep while the events unfold.. however upon discussion of events they decide to not interfere until the timeline unfolds correctly. But they have one problem, a supercharged drift, inside a temporarily enhanced calamity could mean certain death for the both of them, so they live for weeks on shadow stones never leaving the wraith world, the night of elder drift's disappearance comes back into the picture, he recalls doing it to prevent brite bomber from making the dangerous move she had spoken of dreaming countless times, upon his disappearance however, this time with bomber having glimpsed her future self's memories, takes action despite drift disappearing. She had dug for days at the center of the lake and finally found the tip of the cube, using the same technique calamity had used to flash to the cube spawn event she ate the stone, hit the rift, and was standing face to face with old gunner, in a leather trench coat, his hair deadlocked and long with age, they quickly exchange affection, only gunner isn't just an older version of himself he seems afraid, fidgety. After a long embrace, He starts, shock on his face while staring behind bomber, she turns to see dark bomber standing there, holding a dark twisted version of brite bombers own weapon, she says ""it's about time you show up.. what are you waiting for? Do It!"" And gunner grabs brite bomber much harder, forcing her to her knees, grabbing her head by its side, and snapping her neck, as green flames and purple smoke erupt around him and dark bomber and him both begin to laugh maniacally knowing there wasnt much time left before their reign of terror could begin. However brite bombers plan worked, a form of brite gunner did return, the old withered form who suffered at the hands of dark bombers torture for ages, waiting for the time loop to come full circle waiting to escape, knowing that he had selfishlessly sacrificed the containment of the world beyond the cube for his escape from agony, a rift opens up above him, this time pink, not that it mattered to gunner because he had never seen the originals, drift comes flying out and lands beside him rippling with the same energy descending from the rift, they embrace like brothers and laugh despite the evident destruction surrounding them, calamity soars in, and lands before them both, looking back and forth between them before rushing forward and exchanging a kiss with them both, a ghostly mist is enshrouding her trenchcoat. It seems the trio have all changed in ways they never imagined, but they know their battle has just begun.. the husks have begun to spawn. They gaze at the horizon, pock marked with cube growth's and leap together into battle as if death and pain were nothing to fear.. it wasnt until after their first evening of slaying their enemies that anyone started to show a downside to the terrifying side effects of the cube world. And it seems for now that the shame on gunners mind weighed down his conscience to such an extent that despite his best friend and their girlfriend being in possible danger he couldn't bring himself to share with them the way he would glow green in his eyes or breathe a breath of purple smoke after truly exhausting hordes of husks are layed to rest.. after all it's only a flash or puff, they wont see it, and he refuses to become HIM.",FortNiteBR

I was expecting that harvesting wood, brick, or steel would slowly activate this.  


Harvesting materials, nothing.  


Outliving players, nothing.  


I hit the new Cube Fiends, nothing.  


The ONLY time it activated was when I eliminated a Cube Fiend. Is this REALLY the only way to activate this effect? Eliminations? I bought it because I figured it'd be neat to have a harvesting tool change it's image throughout the game, but so far I'm regretting buying this because it doesn't seem to be working as advertised.

Here are my points after 5 months of watching almost every stream:

He flashy edits for no reason, wastes mats constantly building stupid walkways he doesn't use or need, always complains about lag or 'it wont let me edit' when he's losing in fights or does a dumb move boxing himself, chokes a fat one every time he plays scrims he just cant hang gets too nervous, always has a reason for why something didn't work.. Lately he acts so damn arrogant that it makes him pull stupid moves that never work. Like just now he had a 2v1 and was chatting mad shit about how he's 'got this' and when he didn't 'got this' he started to complain about lag, the fact he couldnt edit, and the addition of zombies saying 'who thought this was a good idea' when only yesterday was loving the addition.

I promise I'm not trying to be intentionally toxic to piss of a collection of this sub, these are thoughts I've been having for a while now and the idea of an unpopular opinion thread came from it- although I imagine the only responses I'll get (if any this sub is too damn big now) are from people who fucked my mother.

It’s way easier to loot up early game with them. Which is where I personally have the most trouble/deaths. I hate dying because the house I chose only had ammo and bandages while the other guy found a purple pump. 

As for late game/winning games. 
The game was getting boring for me. 
I’m not amazing at this game by any means. 
But my squad and I get a handful of wins every night. And when we’re winning that blood rushing feeling was gone. My adrenaline wasn’t pumping any more.  My squad and I switched to playing COD. 

BUT NOW. 
With the zombies. 
3 people left. 
I got a dozens of them chasing me while I’m also trying trying to dodge bullets. 
It’s amazing! 
My adrenaline is through the damn roof. 
Probably more so than it used to. 

I hope epic decides to bring this mode back every now and then as an LTM when the event is over. ",FortNiteBR

She suffered from what is called amniotic band syndrome.  Basically an amniotic band wrapped itself around her wrist while she was in utero, causing her to be born with only one hand.  This is fairly common, but less so today due to increased tech in the ultra sound world.  Now the reason I'm posting this is, she has not been able, or has not been interesting in getting into many modern video games because they are just impossible for her to get good at.  In comes Fortnite.  She watched me play a bunch and enjoyed watching (also a new thing) and picked up the controller and started playing.  Now she does not build, and essentially just tries to find scoped weapons and snipe folks, but she absolutely loves Disco Domination.  Just yesterday I saw her the most excited she has been in a while with this game because she actually was able to kill 5 people in a round.  So the point of my post is to remind people that its ok to not be the best at this game, and its ok to not win rounds.  Take pride in your progress and kills and just enjoy what the game is....Fun.

It does consistent damage, works in both close and medium range, very easy to aim with, no timing needed, it's all great right? But when was the last time that you actually felt rewarded for killing someone with a SMG? Speaking for myself, I can't remember. Everyone is using the Shotgun to SMG and I understand that it is the meta, but this games pvp has become so stall because of this, and no map changes will fix this. When Epic introduced the Six Shooter I was happy to finally see some variety, but I soon realized that it can't keep up with the SMGs consistency. 

We need more ways to play the game. When someone kills me with a good shotgun shot, even while being competitive, I still go ""Wow that was a good shot with great timing and aim"". When someone kills me with a SMG it's the exact opposite. 

Fortnite have a great core where people can build their way into the fights, there are some great map changes and some cool weapons. But the overall combat needs a CHANGE. We need more variety and a new META. That is all.

Same sentiments apply here.
People completed the challenge under the premise the reward was battle stars.
Epic realise mistake so change the reward.

The same way you wouldn't expect a physical store to chase up all there customers asking them to return the mispriced item - don't expect Epic to do the same just because you missed out.

Great lifetime stats, played in the pro discord for months, and I have gradually watched this game get worse and worse. 

First, EPIC is doing a great job on many things, it's been awhile since the gaming world has had such an involved developer, with amazing community support. The creativity and content is awesome. Free to play, awarding battle pass, earning back your vbucks. It's nice to see a company listen to the player base.

Now with all of that being said. I do not agree with all of the item/mobility implementations. Everyone bitches each time an item comes out, or a change is made. I would have more respect if they stuck with Fortnite requiring skill, rather than crutching on items/mobility. I'm hoping in all of the additions to the game, there is a silver lining with all of the free tournaments recently introduced. It would be nice to see a ranked queue, with minimal RNG and more skill, based around building and positioning, rather than popping rifts and gliding off high ground whenever you want. 

I'm sure EPIC has a plan, I know they listen to feedback. But in the meantime, some of the content and changes are forced, instead of internally tested. Every update a new crutch is introduced, and all it does is distract casual/lower skill players from the core concept of the game, which is to build fight. Building itself makes Fortnite completely different from other BR games. People need to stop saying that if they take out certain items, it becomes like PUBG or H1Z1. 

Complaining that certain things are OP like double pump, or C4, just means you're a lazy player. Not every fight is a camp and shoot fight. You're going to get knocked off high ground, you're going to have to defensively build. You're going to have to block shots and try to obtain high ground or lure whoever you are fighting into a position that better suits you. Build fights are like chess. 

I see that balloons are coming out, cool I guess? For what I don't know. These novelty items should be in LTMs and not in the core game. Same thing with rift to go, cubes, disco ball, homing missile, vehicles, ice traps, and whatever else I'm forgetting at 2am. 

Every game there is a middle ground of balance. I get that and don't expect Fortnite to ever be perma sweaty where every fight requires 2,000 mats.  

Far too many people rely on rifts and running, rather than fighting and getting better. Ninja said it best months ago, there is no easy way of winning 1v1s at the end of a game. You need to take fights, get better at building, start winning those fights, and you'll win games. 

TLDR: Dumb items are dumb, this post will probably get downvoted and accomplish nothing, but it needed to be said.

1. Emotes. Made widly popular by Fortnite, COD picked up this concept of being able to do more than just T Bag the enemy in game. Pretty much a failure since you really never see it in game.
2. Battle Royale. There is a mixture of speculation on who should be credited with the first battle royale game mode, but one thing is clear. Fortnite should be credited to taking it to a whole other level of success through main stream gaming. So of course main stream games are going to ride the coattails of its success, which includes Black ops.
3. Battle Pass. Everybody who plays more than Fifa or Madden knows that a season pass has been in existence before Fortnite. The thing is, is that Fortnite is the biggest reason a lot of big titles are using this concept in their games recently. That includes: Rocket League, Pubg and Black ops 4.
4. Grapple Gun. Fortnite did it first.
5. Removing Jetpacks. Wow was that a good decision on both sides of the field there.
6. Cross-platform Play With Playstation, Xbox, Switch, Mobile and PC. 
Oh Wait......
7. Battle Royale Tournament. I have never seen a Fortnite tournament been unsuccessful. It pretty much started with the biggest streamer in the world hosting a very well put together series in Las Vegas. Then it was more UMG, which unfortunately we had to deal with Keemstar sometimes, but Friday Fortnite was still a hit. Then the heavily funded Fortnite Skirmishes you see all the time and aren't half bad with Dr. Lupo and Courage changing the broadcasting game. What does Blackout do its first con since release? Real suspect, Treyarch.

Look, there is probably way more things I could mention here, but honestly I just want closure on the topic. All of the things things that I mentioned are actually not bad. It is good that games can borrow concepts and implement them into their own unique way. This is how gaming has evolved over the years. Every game still has its own mechanics that provide a different angle on how to play, whether its building one by ones or trying to find the best perks to end the game with. At the end of the day, we are all gamers just trying to find what we like, so let's be less toxic and catch some dubs.",FortNiteBR

He gets high ground and shoots you with tac. lost. You put away builds and switch to pump but cant shoot because of pump delay. Tac shoots you once again thanks to tactical shoot speed. You panic and shoot him but  s e v e n  d a m a g e. Shoots you again and youre dead. The situation would be different if it was with the heavy shotgun instead or pump. You hit a full headshot on the guy with heavy. Hes dead. If not he builds and you build up to him. He gets high ground and he hits you. You switch back to heavy and shoot him. Boom dead. It doesnt matter though the guy would of been dead from that headshot from the start. You see what im talking about? Pump doesnt deserve to be rare if it doesnt reward you for headshots but a gray tactical does? Come on epic. A rare heavy would of been much but because it takes skill and rewards you for headshots.,FortNiteBR

They also have gotten free Vbucks just for logging in and playing BR. While I understand Epic has to make $, but why aren't the customers that helped this game explode being taken care of atleast in the same level as the new kids on the block? This reminds me of the cable companies business practices where customers who have been with them longer for some reason have to pay way more for the service, while new customers are the ones that get the deals. There is a reason cable companies are dying and this is one of the main reasons. So in closing, I'm not suggesting we get anything more than China does, I'm suggesting that we should get the same treatment and freebies as China. #FortniteFairness",FortNiteBR

TIER 26

being able to do two season passes at once, if you didn't buy it before. You would still have to pay $10/$25 and do it in the original time restraint but I feel this would be a good idea.

I think that removing the stuff and fixing the glitch would have been the RATIONAL thing to do, and tbh I don't know why they let the players keep the stuff. My only guess is that Epic figured that wiether or not the players were meant to get the 350 battlestars, they did and they technically ""earn"" them so they should get to keep them. Of course I'm happy that I got the battle stars in time, and I would have been pissed for a while if the stuff I got was removed, but I would have realized why Epic would have removed it, to make it fair for everyone.

What time is it? It's time to complain on the internet! The show where one guy makes a single post and is either sent to karma hell or heaven! /s

In all seriousness, a ton of people were either delighted or turned into pure salt by the event challenges this morning. 350 battlestars for FREE! People went out of their minds. 35 tiers, 35k xp, wherever you were, there was some good stuff to be getting. And then Epic patched it, and people started complaining. A lot. I was one of them. The most outragous thing to me, personally, was that people could keep the crap-ton of stuff they got. It made it an exclusive reward, for the people who were god-damn lucky enough to be browsing the internet or playing the game at that time. Now that people feel deprived of these rewards, the people who were rewarded are just spamming either ""you should have been there"", ""it's your fault you weren't aware of it"", or ""You're just a salty 9 year old."" All of this can eloquently be condensed into ""I have it and you don't so I don't care."" There are people who had to do other things. It can't be their fault for not being aware of it at the time. The fact that Epic chooses to ignore this and carry on is just unacceptable. They are forcing people to play the game MORE for the same amount of stuff that other people got almost instantaneously! It has impacted player morale and denying that it's unfair is part of the problem. If this had happened with a company like Activision-Blizzard, it would NOT have flown with the playerbase. So the easiest and fairest course of action now would be to simply let the bug stay as is. Everyone would be eligible to get it, and it would NOT be an unfair advantage.

Don't @ me.

Some people got it, some people didn’t. Some people got to play when it happened, some people didn’t. They are letting those who did keep them, and preventing those who didn’t from getting them.

Unfortunately, life isn’t fair.

Despite this, there are a number of ways they could have gone about resolving this without sparking a forest fire with their player-base, and they chose the one thing that would.

a) they could have rolled back the tiers, and no one would be losing anything because they weren’t supposed to have them in the first place (not what I’d recommend)

b) they could have left the challenges for everyone (it would cause problems for those who have done them since the patch)

c) add a reasonable number of tiers to those who missed it (perhaps the same as one of the challenges that rewarded them) or all of them (easy to do, seems like a reasonable option.

d) remove the error and add an additional challenge for those who missed it to catch-up to those who did, that way if someone really wants the tiers, they can have them (too complicated for my taste, but it would solve the issue)

Sadly, they chose the one option that didn’t accomplish any of that.

Unfortunately life isn’t fair, but epic certainly did and does have an opportunity to make good on their mistake in a way that caters to the few and ignores those who bought tiers, grinded for tiers, and missed out on the mishap.

This isn’t a post begging for tiers, this isn’t a post crying for action. This is a post for discussing the action epic took as a result of their mistake.

Online privacy is one of our paramount internet rights, something currently being systematically eroded, and something we should insist on from the games we play.  I've seen threads pointing out how annoying not being able to appear offline is, but I think it's important to point out real-world reasons that this is an issue.  

In my house, the lack of this feature affects each member of my family in different ways.  The way it affects me is just annoying - Random people jumping into my party, blasting emotes over my speakers, it's just plain annoying.  Sure, I could unfriend them, but I still like the people, they have no idea they're imposing, I don't want to make them feel like they're imposing - but they are.  Solution?  Appear offline feature.

For my younger son, he also has to maintain relationships, but he doesn't always want to play with the kid with the loudest voice with no online etiquette because his parents just set him loose unsupervised.  Even if my kid sets his party to private, if they see him online, he'll get 50 invites during the next game until they give up.

All of that is annoying, but the way it affects my teenage daughter is the one that most concerns me.  My daughter has had a stalker, at the age of 16, and while it was swiftly dealt with and was mostly just a scary situation, we started taking online privacy very seriously.  We're all pretty tech saavy, and we turn on the 'appear offline' feature on literally everything that has it - Facebook, Xbox, etc.  Regardless of how paranoid that sounds, it just makes her feel safer for everyone to have immediate access to the fact that she's sitting in her room playing Fortnite whenever she chooses to do that.

I've seen another thread recently that listed pros and cons of this feature, and the 'cons' were that forcing to appear online will increase player interaction and that people just need to 'deal with their online relationships.'  It's not that simple, and the reality is that sometimes the ability to avoid certain types of player interaction is going to keep people playing longer.  I know, personally, I'd play more often if this feature were included.  I'm hoping that somehow we can get some sort of official Epic response on this.",FortNiteBR

However as long as I've been playing (start of season 3) Epic has continuely been nerfing build with the addition of things like:

- quadlauncher
- increased rocket launcher spawn
- increased grenade launcher spawn
- grapplers
- quadcrasher
- glider redeploy
- clingers
- minigun
- p90
- SMG meta in general
- Zombies that literally knock you down mid build fight.

The list goes on and on, with many of the items being added right now in season 6. I just don't understand why Epic is doing this and wanted to hear you opinion, thanks.

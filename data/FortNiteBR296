I've had more fun than the previous weeks of Fortnite. Why do you say? More weapons are viable now. Instead of ""I must get a shotgun or I'll be at a disadvantage immediately."" I don't have to double up shotguns anymore, hell, I don't even have to use shotguns period. SMGs are in such a great place right now, it's amazing.

Let’s take it back to where this all started....

Llamas were needed from 500 to 200 of each type of material, which I believe is just dumb and causes players to spend even more time to mine materials. 
This was also followed by beefing ground mats from 30 to 20. This caused several players to get annoyed and most felt like this was to give new players a chance to compete against good builders.

Furthermore, in the last patch, players can no longer see through walls when editing, and it shows a grey square. The transparent walls gave players a chance to make moves and get better. And yet again, this makes it easier for noobs to hang around with the good players as it is limiting ways for the noobs to die. 

And finally, the infamous shotgun nerf. I guess this doesn’t really change much about shotguns, but I personally believe it suggests that shooting long range with an AR (which is quite easy) is the better way to go.

All in all, I just feel like these changes are slaps in the face to og and skilled players. I understand where Epic is coming from, but these changes annoyed me and from what I have read, most of the community.

The community seems to always be demanding a constant stream of new cosmetics and weapons, both of which we already have plenty of and I do not see any sort of desire for the one thing this game is desperately missing...new maps.

One thing I did not expect when trying out this game in console closed beta was that is was going to just blow away every other game on the market in terms of gameplay content (I'm a no skin who could care less about cosmetic content). I cannot think of any game on the market currently that pushes out new weapons, items and gameplay mechanics out faster than this dev team. It's mind blowing, considering there are much bigger fish in the sea. Which is why this game having only one map baffles me.

This game's one map is adequate and gets the job done but when you consider the fact that this game surpasses every other BR game on the market in every other metric by miles, I do not understand why the community is seemingly blind to this game's one weakness. This game's map is nothing special compared to it's competitors and does not really have biomes, which just drives home the point further on how generic it is. The gameplay in this game is so good that it covers up this fact but it still is problem.

In my mind, the number one thing that should be worked on immediately, above any other thing (well besides a building practice mode which I have been crying about since beta, but they finally added it last week) is a new map for the game. I expect negative replies, but this sort of reaction confuses me when it is very clear that this is the only and obvious weakness this game has right now.",FortNiteBR

the type of system that i think would work the best for a battle royal type of game is a ""Based Line System"". the way it would work is every team that ques for this playlist would have to earn X amount of points (lets say 30) from both kills (1 kill = 3 points) and where you placed in the match ""survival"". break the match up into 4 different brackets. your top 25,50,75, and 100. if you die within the 76-100 zone you are awarded no points. if you die within the 51-75 you are awarded 5 points. if you die 26-50 you are awarded 10 points, and the top 25 players finished will be awarded 15 points. now on top of that you would also award additional points based on where you placed in said bracket. so lets say 2 players finish in the top 25 brackets, both players are given 15 points for that. but one player died as #24""lets say +3 bonus points"" while one finished the game as #1. the player that finished as #1""lets say +12"" would get more bonus points for finishing higher in their said bracket. (input numbers for each other player inside each bracket). now because its a ranked game type you would need to be able to rank up and rank down based off performance. so if the base line is 30. any player that doesnt meet that base line will be counted as a loss for that match, and will derank ""-10 points for a loss"" but any player that meets the base line will go up. ""+20 points per win"" giving players a chance to progress in case they drop and instantly die. players that go well above the base line of 30, ""lets say gets 40 points from both kills+survival"" will be able to earn more than the standard +20 for a win. giving players an incentive to continue to try even after reaching the goal of 30. with this playlist there should also come ranks. IE ""bronze,silver,gold,plat,diamond,challenger,Top 500"". type of ranks. each rank would require X amount of points to go up. for example ( Bronze would be 0-200, Silver 201-400. and so on) so when you earn that amount of points youll rank up into the next division. there will be no point cap at the end. so the top 500 players would just be fighting for whoever can go the highest at that point. there would be 2 playlists. a solo que and a duo que. if playing with a teammate youll combine your total scores to = out at that base line. so if one of you gets 5 kills and the other gets 6 you would = out as an 11 kill total for your team. on the other hand, from the surviavl aspect. the score will only count for how high your team placed as a whole. so if one of you died in the top 50, and one of you died in the top 25, the one who placed higher ""top 25"" will be the bonus points your team will get, meaning that survival points do not stack.

now that was just how i would think the rank system would be based. i also believe there would need to be some balance changes for the ranked mode.

1. All players will spawn in the match with a Grey Tact-shotgun that has a total of 12 shots. (gun isnt strong enough to 1 shot a full health target, doesnt have the range to shoot people while they are still falling. but gives you a fighting chance so you no longer run into a house and die without a gun).

2.all players will spawn into the game with 30 wood.(could live without)

3.all players will spawn with 50 shield. ""so full health, 100. and half shields, 50"".

(lets say 6 players drop in one location, at least 3 of them will find mini shields. which can be an unfair advantage within the first 3 minutes of a match for the other 3 who didnt get any shields. allows a little bit more wiggle room from RNG).

4.the first circle will always drop in the center of the map, but also be big enough that you could reach it within the time limit no matter where you decided to drop on the map. after the first circle, you can go back to its RNG randomness for the rest. ( no more dropping risky but the first circle is at fatal. gives you a more controlled variable when youre deciding where you want to drop. also will make it where half the lobby wont drop and die within the first 3 minutes of the match. this will open up the whole map as a ""doable drop"".  


5. no challenges are going to be doable to the ranked mode

The reasons for these balance changes is because a battle royal game (typically the first 3 minutes) has was too much randomness that can happen to you. these updates would give every player a fair fighting chance from the start of the match.

the numbers of course can be changed to build the best playlist around this style. it just needs a Base line point system. where you earn points on both kills and survival. with both a way to rank up and rank down.",FortNiteBR

Everyone who isn't level 80 and wont make it to level 80 this season, will agree with lowering the required level. For the people who already are level 80 or are nearly there, will disagree with lowering the required level. This is completely understandable. It makes you feel like you put in those many many hours for something many other players will eventually have. But not everyone has alot of free time to grind the game for the complete armor set + colours. For those players, level 80 seems to be unfair and nearly impossible.

Here's my suggestion: award the ones who are level 80+ by the end of july the 10th by giving them an additional colour. Maybe blue, white, orange, or there could even be a vote in the menu of the game that may only be participated by the players who got the complete armor set at that moment of time to vote which additional colour they want to see on the Omega skin. After the awards have been given out, the required level lowers from 80 to 70-75. ",FortNiteBR

My name’s Matt. I got into Fortnite earlier this year and fell in love. I had a group of friends that played, but because of work/life getting in the way, it was hard to find time to play together. I didn’t love Solos, and queuing into Duos or Squads was a waste 99% of the time, so I started looking for better ways to find others I could play with. I tried using LFG subreddits, Discord, FB groups, and other sites/apps, but it still took so much time to find people, and I just wanted to play and grind XP. 

Our team felt the same way, so we’ve worked together to build SCOUT. SCOUT is a new, completely free, Fortnite teammate finder app that is powered by AI. This AI will match you with other players, and will get better the more you use it by learning which type of players you enjoy playing with.

We believe that this is an awesome solution for finding better teammates, and want to invite you to help us shape and grow the AI during our exclusive beta.

We’re launching a closed beta on July 6th with limited slots, and to give back to the community for your support, we’ll have all active users in the beta (signed up and actively matching with players) be eligible for V-Bucks giveaways planned for July/August!

To sign up to the beta, and to learn more about the app, check out: https://www.joinscout.gg/

Here’s a Gyfcat of the App in action, too! https://gfycat.com/PettySeveralCivet
(early testing version, assets and text subject to change)

Claim your spot on the Beta Bus before they run out, help make sure nobody is ever without a teammate, and hopefully I’ll get to match with some of you on July 6th!

Myself I play this game casually and this is a casuals POV on season level challenges, it is INCREDIBLY hard to get max if play this game for 30 minutes to 1 1/2 hours.

1. They throttled your xp

From level 1-60 your only **halfway** to level 80. It takes about 2k more xp on average from level 60+ than in season 3. Why did they do this? I don’t know. Level actually matters in this season to unlock upgrades for carbide and omega and they make it even harder. It’s a dumb way to make people play this game more. Not only did they make it harder to level up, they lowered the xp reward in game. 

2. Level 80 for omega

Why is it this high if our xp is already lowered. It takes **500k** xp just to get to level 80. You only get 1/10 of that from doing every battle pass challenge. Our xp is already throttled, a lot of us don’t play with others in every match, we’re being pressured because of a time limit and have limited options to gain xp. What is the point of this? If you want people to play more, don’t make it almost impossible for a normal person to unlock this skin. It’ll only make people mad if they want the skin.

3. Time limit (unless the challenge carries over seasons. Challenge could be modified to fit the next season.)


Only about two months for the season to end. The challenge requirements either need to be lowered or brought over into the next season in a modified way. Another quick thing is with the John wick challenge. Why didn’t that one carry over? It was more difficult than endlessly grinding a game that has a rng factor to it. It could have easily been brought to the next season. 

Challenges that are timed and involve a heavy amount of boring grinding should not be in the game. Most of the playerbase are not tryhards that can get the skin in the first month. 

Sidenote- Why do I want this skin? It looks cool that’s why and it’s probably the only option I’m going to have at getting a nice skin without spending money (I refuse to do). But it’s just a skin! Yeah but you buy high quality clothing don’t you? It’s almost exactly the same thing. I really don’t care if I get down voted. This needs to be addressed in some form if you want to please your playerbase. It’s complete rubbish that a large portion of the playerbase can’t complete a challenge just because they don’t put the time into playing this game.",FortNiteBR

This should also apply to the revolver as they both share a small clip, heavy recoil, and slow rate of fire, yet do the same as a  basic AR with a faster fire rate, larger clip, and less skill involved. Not to mention the HC uses heavy ammo and has a smaller clip than the semi sniper, but still has a greater damage dropoff rate.

Will Moisty be destroyed at the coordinates TwoEpicBros. claim to have discovered?

Will Epic destroy the sparsely populated Wailing Woods, beloved drop spot and safe-haven for noobies? Or will the Missile Make a Mess of the Moisty Mire Movie Set? Will Epic trick us all and blow up Tomato Town?

Recently the Omen/Fate skin with the oracle pickaxe and split wing glider costs about 40 dollars in total and I think that’s just way overpriced.

This isn’t really a complaint topic because skins are completely optional but it would be nice to feel like I’m getting value out of my purchases. Backblings help with that and I think including a glider or pickaxe with every legendary skin would just increase that value even more. This would also help differentiate what makes a skin epic or legendary. Epic skins could still be really high quality like the new detective skins and come with a backbling while legendary skins like the new female omega would come with the new glider. 

All in all I’m just saying legendary skins should come as a package helping make them stand apart for their value and making the consumer feel really good about making that 20 dollar purchase.",FortNiteBR

I do think it can be very OP because you can see the player when he can not see you and wait for the moment to strike. I also think this is a important aspect to Fortnite and so it must not be completely removed because it has already been in the game for so long.

Maybe Epic has something planned out for this in the future but I feel that this change is just another step in pushing the building aspect of this game away from players, the part of the game that makes it unique.

I think everyone should have an equal chance to achieve rewards.

Please bear with the post as it is a long one and read it in its entirety. Thank you.

Let's begin.

Nintendo Switch based players should receive more time to achieve the Battle Pass tiers and Season Levels. This time should be equivalent to be the difference of the 70 days which the season lasted and the number of days which the Nintendo Switch version of the game has been available in order to give the exact same chance to obtain rewards that all other players received.

I am a Switch player, my account has only ever played on a Switch and I feel as though I should try to voice my opinion and make an appeal to permit exclusively Switch based players more time for this Season's rewards and experience levels.

As I'm sure all of you are aware of, Fortnite was released on the Nintendo Switch console during E3 just a little while back. Up until then, many of us did not have any ability to play the game. The season was already over halfway in progress and many Switch players purchased Battle Passes. There has been some controversy about the Battle Pass and especially the Level 80 Omega rewards in reference to its difficulty. Let me state now that I do NOT believe that it is too difficult to obtain. My context for suggesting/requesting this is fairly simple. Switch players have not had enough time. I will present myself as an example. I have reached level 60 in the time Fortnite has been available on the Nintendo Switch. My progress has been fairly decent in my opinion, and I have obtained the level 100 Battle Pass in an attempt to boost my experience gain. With all of this progress, I will not be feasibly able to reach level 80 due to a lack of time caused by work and the gym. This is just my story, though, all other Switch players are inevitably affected by this.

I would not think that this suggestion was fair if I, and by extension, other exclusively Switch based players had already had the opportunity to play the game when the Season had already begun, however, this isn't the case. We have only just recently gained access to Fortnite and have thus had an unreasonable disadvantage in the form of time. New consoles do not pop up all the time and so this is obviously a request that I believe can only be reasonably made in specific situations.

To clarify my suggestion/request, It is that people who's accounts have ONLY played on a Nintendo Switch should be given more time in order to complete this Season's Battle Pass as well as Season Level. This would provide us an equally fair opportunity to reap the rewards which all other players have been able to achieve, as well as demonstrate continued support for the Nintendo Switch version of the game from EPIC.

You might ask how EPIC might go about this and I have as well, this is what I have come up with: EPIC must have access to see when accounts were created as well as what mediums they played Fortnite through. EPIC could provide extra time to players who have ONLY played on Nintendo Switch Consoles, and have thus created their accounts within the time that Fortnite has been available for the console. This would permit exclusively Switch based players to get the same chance as everybody else has.

To conclude, I want to stress that I do not believe Switch players should receive and UNFAIR advantage. Only EXCLUSIVELY Switch based players who have never played beforehand would receive this time extension in order to provide EQUAL chance. Many players would understandably be angry if others received an unfair advantage, thus, I want to stress that I am of this mindset as well.

Some responses to potential issues with this suggestion that have been brought up are going to be listed:

Q: How would Epic go about this?

R: I can't speak to how the code works. I imagine that Epic tracks progression and then plugs that into the Battle Pass interface. This progression could remain tracked for those who have only played on a Nintendo Switch in order to give them equal time as everyone else. The interface could be taken so far as to remain and be accessible through the press of a button in order to be still visible during Season 5.

Q: Wouldn't this interfere with Season 5 progression?

R: No, the reason being that Season 4 progression would be tracked separately under the implementation of this. Season 5 would be able to continue unaffected.

Q: What about Mobile? They didn't get the same full time as everyone else? What sets the Switch apart in this situation from Mobile?

R: This is probably one of the better questions I received in regards to this. So I got some numbers and dates in order to better elaborate why this doesn't change my stance. This will be listed below.

Fortnite on IOS launched on March 15th.

Season 3 Lasted from February 22nd - April 30

Mobile Players had 6 weeks and 4 days (46 days) to complete the Battle Pass.

Switch players will currently have June 12 - July 12 to complete the battle pass along with the new Season Level rewards which are equivalent to 4 weeks and 2 days (30 days).

This is less than half the time of a Season, and two weeks and two days less than mobile players had.

This brings in the matter of time. One of the somewhat taboo but necessary aspects of this Season which we have to consider is the Season Level rewards. They should go to those who worked for them and if this suggestion is taken into consideration and ultimately implemented then no freebies will be given and all who want the Season Level rewards will still have to work to achieve them.

Q: Epic probably isn't thinking about this at all. They probably just won't implement it anyway, so why bother?

R: That's the source of suggestions. This isn't a request to nerf building, shotguns, or change any mechanics of the game. This is a plea from Switch Players to Epic to give us a reasonable chance to unlock and achieve everything from this Season without giving us an unfair advantage over players on other platforms.

Thank you for reading my suggestion, if you have any concerns and/or comments/questions, please voice them and I will add significant ones to the post should some consensus be reached.",FortNiteBR

Yesterday we launched the Playground LTM. So many of you rushed in to create and play that our matchmaking service fell over. We’ve since separated the Playground matchmaker from the one that affects the default modes and made large improvements to assist with the number of players. We plan to push these changes and improvements live later today to bring the Playground LTM back online.




/end quote 


What they are doing to get this up and running is costing a lot of money, I suspect they have built new matchmaking servers for Play Ground over night practically.

  They would not go through all that trouble and money spent just for a short term plan.

I play for fun but love improving and pushing myself to play better.

Footsteps are a very crucial part of this game. The problem with that is that footsteps are *one of the quietest parts of the game*. To be able to consistently hear footsteps, I have to be RIP Headphone User'd by literally everything. Critical hits for harvesting on anything, anything metal, the pump, and explosions. There are more I think, but you get where I'm going.

Leading on to **WHY** I am posting this, something personal to me and a little gross... I recently had ear complications and had all my earwax cleaned out. One ear in particular seemed to be more sensitive to the change in sound levels than the other after cleaning. I am now scheduling a doctor's appointment to take a look at that ear for what I believe may be a ruptured ear drum due to the new sensitivity of my ear along with loud noises from gaming (Fortnite).

I know a lot of people will say it's my fault and I should be more careful, and I definitely agree. I didn't take good care of myself following ear complications and due to that is the result of my situation.

**That being said, I just want to play the game competitively without having tinnitus after playing for long gaming sessions.**

Yes, Moisty Mire. I have been going there since season 4 started because of the amazing loot. Because there is so much of it, I usually can't loot all of it unless I get the circle,.Twice. Go there as a squad. You'll be rewarded. Risky Reels is also great. There are 15 chest spawns in the main compound, but uf you count all the suburban homes, and other spawns, you have 29. Please upvote if this helped you.NOTE: The chest numbers were counted to the best of my ability, the data is not invalid if one chest was miscounted. For example, I included the two chest spawns by the tree next to Risky Reels, even though the game doesn't add them.  Also, chest spawns are not the only measure of  quality of a location.  In no particular order;

1. Materials
2. Floor loot
3. Chests
4. Lootability (How quickly can you loot it?)
5. Location (Are you likely to get a good circle?
6. Survival (What is your chance to get killed before mid-game?)

For reference, Moisty Mire is the best in the map for materials, has decent floor loot (don't have any data but experience), tied for the most chest spawns, but has low lootability playing as a solo because of the sheer amount of loot. The circle is medium/bad.

He could possibly be one of the best builder in this game but he never seems to pull any viewers. He recently made s YouTube video of him playing against 100T Kenith and Tempo Payne in playground mode. You have to see the video to understand that he can easily compete with these amazing players but can also do bette than them. I’m only doing this post because I feel that aipha has been left in the clouds. Thanks for reading, here is the link to that video: https://youtu.be/3B2XoWiuXkc",FortNiteBR

I can't count the amount of times i've died because someone is sitting behind a wall with their hunting rifle and instead of having to peek and take a risk they just uncrouch, crouch, so fast that you cant even hit them if you were to shoot back.

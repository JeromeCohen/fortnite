In the previous battle passes, you kept all exp you had required during the season, and it counted when you finally unlocked the last skin (Omega and Ragnarok).

People can buy tiers to unlock the Battle Pass early, that's fine BUT, players who chose to buy the battle pass and work towards unlocking the rewards, SHOULD NOT be punished by NOT having ANY exp counted towards the skin progression when unlocking the final skin in the battle pass, that's the current situation.

Epic changed this SOLELY to encourage people to buy tiers in the battle pass, it's utter nonsense, and takes away the satisfaction of working towards the rewards.

Change the system back, there was nothing wrong with it in the first place.",FortNiteBR

Just pure gun and build fights.

Huge ways this can make player experience a lot better:

1) Separates tryhards from casual players.

I consider myself a tryhard but sometimes I just wanna play and chill. This is not quite possible when other players who are putting their skills to test and trying their best find me and kick me back to the lobby relatively easy because I'm not in the mood to fight back. The game becomes boring very fast and I stop playing until I'm in the mood to tryhard myself.

2) Actually gives a reason to play the game other than having fun.

Since the beginning, there is no real reward for getting 1st place other than self-satisfaction (except maybe XP bonus). Implementing a ranked playlist means implementing ranks to look forward to climb. So if you're good at the game you'll actually have something to show for it besides the number of wins you have.

3) Allows balancing for each playlist (casual/ranked) individually.

So far Epic is forced to vault items to make room for new ones and to increase the skill level in some cases. For example, bouncers were removed so that you have to be mindful of how high you build. But at the same time pretty much everyone can agree that bouncers made the game more interesting in many different ways. So maybe bouncers can exist in a casual playlist but not in a ranked playlist.

This can go for any gun or item added to the game. Let me know what you think.",FortNiteBR

Around mid game while rotating I took a shadow stone. While in shadow form I spotted someone, got close enough to take a shot, so I stopped shadow mode. Killed this guy and went on to win later on. 
The kicker is in replay mode it shows me NEVER leave shadow mode(I like to watch my victims perspective) but in game I was my normal character. 
I dislike the whole idea of these shadow stones but the one time(for real) I take one I believe it glitches. I'm on mobile but I can post game footage and replay footage to show I wasnt glitched in game.

My question is can anyone confirm taking a shadow stone in game, it going away like normal but showing the opposite in replay? Thanks peeps

As many of us know, the revolver being vaulted kinda sucked because some of us actually enjoyed the weapon at least for early game. 

I had an idea of a concept or it could just be a buff to the revolver.

The stats/rarity would be

Rare
Damage: 59
Shot speed: .95
Magazine size: 6
Reload speed: 2.5 seconds 

Epic
Damage: 62
Shot speed: 1.1
Magazine size: 6
Reload speed: 2.3 seconds 

The weapon itself would look just like the Lawbirnger from STW, the weapon would also have a special ability where you can hold down the hammer with your hand and shoot a very high recoil 6 round burst by holding the shoot button, this will prevent you from going into ADS mode but it will be effective at close range. 

Here is what the Lawbringer looks like

First off, they vaulted the drum gun. A lot of people think it was a bad thing, but people like me who don't rely on holding the shooting button to win fights were very happy. They also vaulted the LMG, which I think was a GREAT thing because this gun was way to strong. Along with the LMG getting vaulted, they vaulted the suppressed SMG, which I think wasn't a good thing. The suppressed SMG didn't have an over powered fire rate like the regular SMG. I feel like they should have vaulted the compact SMG and kept the suppressed SMG instead. Next we have the minigun, and as many of you know this thing is waaaay to good end game when you have 999 light bullets. I feel like it would be really balanced if it had a cool down, say you can shoot for 15 seconds with it, but you have to wait 10 to shoot again, but IDK that's just an example. Also I feel like ARs are too good close range, and I get sprayed a lot with them close range and loose fights to them when I'm using a pump and hitting my shots. I just feel like ARs should be balanced in some way where they are not better than shotguns at close range. Anyway those are just my thoughts on how Epic can improve the current meta in Fortnite.

I’ll even take a reduced sentence to a temp ban but i just want to play with my friends again and i don’t want the money and time i used to go to waste. I had max battle pass from season 3-5 and I was working on season 6 before I got banned. I’ve never done anything suspicious. One thing that might be suspicious is that my ip changes as I use GeForce Now to play on PC which is a cloud gaming service that might change my IP in the process. Other than that nothing in my opinion is suspicious. Please understand I have been falsely banned. Thank you for reading this spread the word if you can.,FortNiteBR

Salty is easily one of the best places in the game, there’s is probably around 3-10 people there each game (depending on game mode and bus drop) yet it always feels so active and fun. The actual layout of the city makes it action-packed, exciting and really fun overall to go to. Salty has been with us since season 1, although it didn’t have a name. It has been mine and a lot of other peoples favourite drops for a long time. Since season 1, i’ve probably dropped Salty 30% of the time. 

Now obviously most of you will probably be saying ‘oh nobody cares about your opinion’ but i already know that nobody cares, i’m mainly saying it to get my thoughts out there and see if anybody agrees.

Salty is just naturally one of the best and funnest places on the map. Don’t destroy Salty, please.

Upon hearing of this, I was ecstatic. T-Posing has been something special to me, ironically. In middle school, I was pretty awkward, socially. I had friends, but I was, a lot of the time, left out or bullied by other kids. It wasn't all doom and gloom, but it could have been better. 

   Fast forward to April. Fortnite is still all the buzz, and finals are getting closer by the day. One of my friends offhandedly mentioned learning what a T-Pose is. I had known about T-Posing in the context of video games for a while, but it wasn't really until around that time that the T-Pose meme began to take off. I thought the whole thing was pretty funny, and so one day, in English class, my friend and I T-Posed. A couple other kids in my class thought that was pretty funny. Our teacher brushed it off, thinking it was just some silly thing I was doing, as per the reputation I had. A few weeks pass, and I kept T-Posing in random classes, particularly English. By this point, the entire English class was on the T-Pose train, and our teacher even played along with it. Other kids that I never really thought would talk to me much started to make T-Pose Tuesday jokes with me. I would go to gym class and see kids I'd never even met, beyond a few sentences, T-Posing. Popular kids, even, thought I was hilarious for the whole deal. It was then that I realized how I started a ""thing"" at my school. It was good, dumb fun that brought everyone together. 

   A few months prior, I had decided that I would be going to a different high school from the rest of my classmates. It was a bittersweet choice, and one that I'm still unsure about today. At the faculty vs. students basketball game, I made a sign supporting our teachers, with the English teacher T-Posing on the back. Dozens of kids were T-Posing in the bleachers. At the eighth grade dance, a couple of my friends and I spend the night beautifully single, T-Posing the whole time. We [even got our history teacher to join in.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/TPoseMemes/comments/9l55iw/last_years_school_dance_ft_my_history_teacher/) Towards June, I realized how much people had come to actually like me - not just because of the T-Posing, really, but because of me being myself. I knew I couldn't just leave everyone at the end of the year without one good sendoff. 

   Around May, the Spanish teacher had apparently T-Posed. I was decently mad over this, as I was afraid it was about to become ""normie"". My English class had been supportive of me so far, and so we organized to invite her to the class, play the Halo theme, and T-Pose on her to let her know it belonged to us. It, however, failed spectacularly, as she T-Posed back and compared it to dabbing. I wasn't about to just let something so special to me die just because of that. So I made a speech. It went as follows, with names omitted for privacy: 

""Hey. You all know what today is, right? It’s the final T-Pose Tuesday of the year. Now, our Spanish teacher T-posed one week ago in class. Actually, that’s an understatement. She either misunderstood us or refused to understand our message, and T-posed anyway. She went on to dab, and, despite our efforts, we did not “take back the T-pose”. Rather, the opposite happened. She embraced the T-pose. She saw our presentation as us showing her “how to fit in with the kids”, rather than us telling her that this was something special to us that we’d prefer she stayed out of. What happens next, we have no control over. I’m afraid that her influence may beat the joke into the ground. But let’s refrain from staying bitter with her. Rather, let’s take this chance to look back on what the T-pose meant to us. I never thought a stupid joke like this could be spread across the school. You’ll see a few kids T-posing regularly during lunch, or during gym, or in the halls. It’s because you all wanted to be stupid with me that we’ve gotten this far. And, well, if you’ve known me in the slightest, you’d know that I’m not some grand old role model. I do dumb stuff for who knows why. So seeing the T-pose take off and gain traction really made me feel like I had left an impact of some sort. And, y’know, I’m sure we all remember my over-the-top reactions to certain T-pose moments. Maybe I was having a little more fun than everyone else. Maybe that wasn’t the best way to act in class. Now, at this point in the year, it’s no secret that I won’t be joining you guys next year in high school. But that doesn’t make my point any less significant. T-posing was something that could bring us all together. Nobody cared who you were or what you were like. We could all be dumb together. And that was the beauty of it. Good, dumb fun we could all enjoy. I feel like that really strengthened our school as a community, you know? We all had this common fun thing to connect over. And, y’know, if the Spanish teacher wants to make T-posing a “normie” meme and get everyone doing it, then so be it. It could end up like the dab and become brutally forced. I don’t care. Let’s T-pose because of what it meant to us. I want you to consider this: See how easily we as a school could be brought together? So next year, when I’m long gone, I want you to remember how easy it is to connect with others. It doesn’t have to be through some silly gesture. Just as long as you make sure to keep a sense of community, I’ll be happy. I want to thank you all. For going along with everything that has gone down this year. Especially our teacher. I don’t think I’ve ever met a teacher as persistent and tolerant as you. ...Today’s still T-Pose Tuesday, though, isn’t it? So… What better send-off than to join as a class in a final T-pose together? 

Thank you. You’ve been wonderful peers."" 

   This was delivered in the English class where it all started shortly after the last final, a few days before the last day of school - the last time I'd see most of my friends, ever. The last day of school was a merry old time, with games and music and T-Posing and whatnot. My history teacher's final words to me were to ""t-pose it up"". I loved the guy. My English teacher, however, had something else to say. I was so in the moment that I can't recall exactly what he said, but I remember that he shook my hand and called me ""sir"". As I got on the bus for the final time, I saw my English, math, and history teachers out the window, waving at everyone. I waved back, and had an idea. I T-Posed at them, and they T-Posed back. That's the last time I ever saw them in person, and I couldn't ask for a better send-off. 

   I'm getting seriously nostalgic typing this up. Not a day has gone by that I haven't missed everyone from elementary and middle school. In July, my report card came in the mail. My English teacher had a [special comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TPoseMemes/comments/8zmz72/my_report_card_i_couldnt_be_prouder/) for me. What I'm hoping is that the portion of my English class that was into Fortnite at the time still plays it. I didn't get into it until the Switch version launched, and the year was nearly over at that point. As I write this, I'm hoping that one of them is online right now, seeing the news about the T-Pose emote, and thinking of me. 

I'll be thinking of them every time I use it.",FortNiteBR

There was the drum gun, the Tactical SMG, and alot more. We haven't seen these guns in a while and I think Epic should put them back in the game with a LTM or just add them in playground. For an LTM you can only use vaulted guns and traps. No healing or shields since nothing like that has been vaulted as of right now. You load in with a completely different map with locations that have been removed from the original. 

1. Anarchy Acres

2. Tomato Town

3. Dusty Depot

4. Moisty Mire

5. Loot Lake (it was technically removed)

6. Unnamed POI (Like prison, the office, soccer field etc)


There will also be multiple ways to win

1. Be the last one standing

2. Collect 10,000 coins (from the score Royale LTM. The high amount of coins needed is because it's easy to get something like 5000 or something)

3. Find the jewel and get to the getaway van (from the Getaway LTM. The way everything works in that LTM in terms of how to win is pretty much the same)

This gives more choices to the players and how they want to win. This would be available in both Solos and Squads. Finally a few other things. The battle bus will switch between the Birthday and Christmas battle bus. The storm will have it's original look from season 1, And that's it. Oh and here are the guns and traps that would be in this mode

1. Drum Gun
2. Submachine Gun
3. Tactical Submachine Gun
4. Suppressed Submachine Gun
5. Tactical Shotgun (Epic rarity only)
6. Pump Shotgun (Common rarity only)
7. Revolver
8. Suppressed Pistol (Legendary only)
9. Dual Pistols (Legendary only)
10. Bolt Sniper (Legendary only)
11. Semi Auto Sniper (Epic and Rare only)
12. Zapatron (Only in supply drops)
13. RPG (Rare only)
14. Egg Launcher
15. Snowball Launcher
16. Pumpkin Launcher
17. C4
18. Impulse Grenades
19. Smoke Grenades
20. Jetpack

Traps

1. Bouncer
2. Wall Dynamo
3. Ceiling Zapper
4. Directional Jump pad (up)
5. Directional Jump pad (left right etc)

An example of this idea I’ve taken from another game in which League of Legends released Championship Riven and then Championship Riven 2016. I’m currently in hospital so I can’t provide a link however it had updated particle effects and updated visuals. Maybe this could be done with these skins.

Also offering the original buyers of the skin both styles would also be generous but not a necessity.

I think that epic should increase the pull out time, and also increase the damage so that it can one pump again. It would be cool if they removed the pull out delay all together on the pump, but i think adding one pump back could change up the gameplay.

Fortnite has \*appeared\* to run quite smoothly on my PC under the default graphics quality settings.  Very little perceivable jitters or lag or glitches.  I could run/fly/explore/loot with no issues at all.

What I could NOT do was hit anything.  Anything.  Ever.

It was infuriating to have it be so difficult for me to land a shot but see so many goofballs run around bullseyeing everything while hopping on the run.  I became wrongly convinced that the servers were just crawling with cheaters because how could they be so accurate when it's clearly so hard?  I'm more embarrassed about that, honestly, than I am about how bad I was.  Anyhoo

I followed all the expert advice about mouse sensitivity, acceleration (turning off), DPI, pre-aiming, sundry more, and accomplished nothing.  It never occurred to me to go check my FPS performance because, once again, it didn't \*look\* or even feel bad at all.  Then early this week someone said go check it anyway because they also couldn't hit spit when theirs was in the 20s.  I checked mine.  It hovered around 23.  Holy crap.

Getting it up to 60 &amp; beyond was mostly a matter of reducing every graphical perk to bare minimum &amp; reducing my 3D Resolution percentage into the 60's as well, but once I got my FPS up into that range I was landing shots at a near 100% accuracy &amp; have racked up quite a few kills in just a few games over the last few lunch breaks.

About shooting any gun except shotguns and RPGs it's suck even target in crosshair that never hit target.

I play this solo about 100 times but lose every match.

Normally I play Squad my best elimination of Squad is 4.

My friends is about low skill - average skill, I am look like low skill very much, I am not good at building when combat come enemies alway got high build than me.

I play this game since SS4 I never got win in solo.

I use so many tactics to get win like camping , logic ""Let them fight"" , stay highground , rush into fighting when 3 players left.

All of my friends got solo win and I never get a single win.

I am such a burden.

I try so hard.

I am so tried for solo.

So what about any tips to get win in solo?

From close they'll take the smallest angles and jump out not facing my direction at all but snapping directly to my head and shooting as soon as it gets there. Now I know that's definitely plausible but the way it looks when it's aimbotting it just snaps and stays there for a second as opposed to a more natural movement.

Players do not like catching a player out in the open, tagging them once or twice, only for that player to turn around, build a bunch of walls/ramps and kill them.

I hear it all the time.  ""I had that guy then he can just build with 3,000 mats and get on top of me?  So stupid...""

I tend to agree with this sentiment.  I'm always for any decision that makes Fortnite a more tactical game.

My Suggestion: Right now you can unload an SMG into someone auto building a wall and not a single bullet will get through.  You literally can't touch the guy as long as he has enough materials.  I think a bullet should be able to penetrate an auto build wall every 2 or 3 seconds (not all will hit player).

Defensive building is fantastic.  It allows short gunfights to turn into intense long ones.  But it shouldn't be a crutch for careless players.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all I'd like to point out that if our opinions don't match it doesn't mean you should bury this post with dislikes, I think Epic should be able to see debates like this...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think Epic should re-introduce the skin and here is why...

When you're talking about rarity in Fortnite what is the first thing that comes to your head? Skull Trooper? Ghoul Trooper? The Scythe? Maybe the Christmas pickax? Mako Glider? When you re-introduce something that is considered to the community to be ""rare"" you take that hype away. The only reason the Skull Trooper is so desired is because of the rarity, lets be honest, there are skins that are wayyyy better looking... The second its re-released you lose that rarity factor and that hype factor. Then it just becomes another skin that everyone has. Think about other games like CSGO for example when you see a Dragon Lore you crap your pants and Valve hasn't made any effort to make the skin easier to acquire.

&amp;#x200B;

If the Skull Trooper, Ghoul Trooper and Scythe are to be released again it will be a big spit in the face to all the people that actually have the skin. They got it because they were around when Fortnite was just hitting mainstream. The players in that time period helped to get the game on its feet and get the game out-there and most of them are still playing to this day. The first handful of players helped open the doors for Epic to make absolute bank on their title. Now I know that may be kind of a stretch but I really do believe that.

&amp;#x200B;

Something that I really love about this game is the voiceless interactions you can have with other players in the pregame lobby... Some of the funniest clips on Fortnite come from people syncing dances or shooting at someone and they disconnect in pregame lobby. Every once in a while in a Pregame lobby I load into I see around 5-10 people circling a Skull Trooper skin and I find that awesome. There is legitimate hype around the skin and as the game of Fortnite progresses i'm sure you'll see the skull trooper less and less making it that much cooler to see. Yeah I want the skin pretty bad I wont lie. But If its re-released it just loses its value. Would Epic really throw away a major rarity in their game for a money grab?

&amp;#x200B;

I can see why so many people want the skin and I understand why the community is begging for Epic to bring it back. I agree completely that it is always cool to see a Skull Trooper and I get why people want it but I think they should take a different route.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe instead of the Skull Trooper and Ghoul Trooper they should release a new set of new Halloween skins that look sick. Preserve the Skull Trooper Epic please, I think you'll be making a mistake if its re-released.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, please like I said earlier, just because you disagree with me doesn't mean you need to smash the hell out of the dislike button instead leave a comment on why the Skull Trooper should be brought back or maybe if you agree with me leave a couple more points on why it should stay exclusive. I want Epic to hear everyone's true input. Not just ""I want the skin please bring it back"". Share why they should bring it back.

This was a mistake on our end to include that bullet point in our patch notes. I know that this is the biggest issue for the Fortnite mobile community and this issue is being worked on. 

While I do not have an exact timeline to give you all on when this issue will be fixed, I can say that we have identified the main cause of this bug and are confident that we will have a fix ready to deploy after the appropriate testing has taken place.

We want everyone to have an enjoyable experience when playing on mobile. This includes the “Claw” style and your standard “Two Thumbs” method of playing. This bug has been seen more when playing with the claw style. If you are playing and experience this bug there is a current workaround. The method comes from community figures and is as follows: **The best way to bypass the interaction bug is by having two fingers touching the screen and then tapping on the item.**

Now, this may not fix the issue 100% of the time, but it is a current workaround I wanted to share with the community for those who may have been unaware. We want to get this issue resolved soon.

I thank you all for your patience on this issue,

However, with the rise in popularity over the past six months in *Fortnite’s Battle Royale* mode, V-bucks have taken the stage for the one of the most successful, and expensive, micro-transactions in gaming history. However, I want to propose new ways to approach and obtain V-bucks from Season 6 onward (this suggestion is also open as a community discussion).
____________________________________________
Currently, there are only **two ways** to obtain V-bucks: purchasing a one-time Starter’s Pack for a small slump of money that grants you 600 V-bucks and a limited-time skin and back bling alongside other transactions of $10.00, $25.00, $50.00, and $100.00 (which the ladder three offer some extra V-bucks), and earning up to 1,300 V-bucks by ranking through a Season’s Battle Pass completely (300-400 V-bucks from the Free Pass).

However, I would like to propose to the community (and any EPIC Games employees if they are reading) more opportunities to obtain V-bucks that are both consumer friendly, but still allow profit to be made on EPIC’s part.

• **Purchasing V-bucks**

1. Add a $5.00, $15.00, $20.00, $40.00, and $75.00 purchase increments for V-bucks (this allows players to purchase lower amounts of V-bucks to top of their balance if they’re only a few hundred V-bucks away from an item they want. This also allows for EPIC Games to add *even more *extra** V-bucks for higher-tier purchases, creating a bigger incentive to purchase more V-bucks at once).
2. Add a non-taxed option for users to *directly* buy however many V-bucks they need. Since a single V-bucks is equal to a penny, this should be easy to implement. A user wants to buy 350 V-bucks for a skin he or she wants? Your total is $3.50, no tax. However, since it could be non-taxable, the users could only purchase up to 1,000 V-bucks a week with this system, to prevent loopholing with bundled transactions.

• **Obtaining V-bucks**

1. Quite obviously, users can obtain V-bucks by purchasing them from the in-game store or by redeeming a code for x amount of V-bucks. Users could also buy V-bucks with the proposed additional price increments, alongside the proposed non-taxable V-buck system (up to maximum of 1,000 V-bucks).
2. Make the Free Pass every season contain 100 V-bucks every ten tiers. By the end of the season, if a user *reaaallly* didn’t want to spend money on V-bucks, they would have just enough to enjoy the full Battle Pass, but also have to put a lot of time in-game to earn the Free Pass V-bucks.
3. Remove the reward of XP and tiers for Daily Challenges, and instead reward players with either twenty-five to fifty V-bucks for completing Daily Challenges.
4. Add the ability to earn V-bucks by completing challenges tied to Limited Time Modes such as **Close Encounters** or **Score Royale**. This will make people more interested in playing LTMs, while at the same time rewarding them for playing them and giving EPIC Games great feedback on LTMs.
5. Log-in bonus. Every day a player logs in, they are rewarded fifteen V-bucks. If a player successfully logs in for seven consecutive days, they are rewarded their fifteen V-bucks daily on top of an additional thirty for the week.

• **Spending V-bucks**

1. Item shop, obviously. The continuation of daily rotations of skins, glider, harvesting tools, emotes, and back bling (and many other things) are a great thing to spend V-bucks on. Additionally, the rumors of EPIC Games adding hats to the game could drive up V-buck sales.
2. An implementation of possible weapon camos would be a great use of V-bucks.
3. Wager Matches: players are able to set down any amount of V-bucks they want to participate in a Wager Match. Wager Matches could include twenty to one-hundred players with a faster storm, smaller map area to play in, decreased chest spawns, Limited Time Modes, and much more. In Solo Wager Matches, winner takes 70% of set down V-bucks, second takes 20% and third takes 10%. In Duos and Squads, the percentage distribution is the same, however the amount of V-bucks per player is split either down the middle or into four piles.

Now I don’t know if I post like this has even been made before, and feel free to bash my ideas for being a newbie Reddit user, but I created this account to make this post (and many others). Additionally, these are **only ideas**, not facts, not leaks, and surely not in the game. I just think seeing these things would be cool, and would allow the V-buck system to be even more profitable while also being more consumer friendly.

And that bang would be the season 6 end. Think about it:  
The season 6 ends at December 6th (presumably, if there are no extensions)  
Season 5 had cracks in the ceiling(?), which could have been the prologue on how StW could have happened, but don't quote me on this one.  
There is a lot of purple color in this season, and that's one of the main qualities in StW.  
The reason why I mentioned the ending date of the season would fit perfectly with the StW release, because it's written so it would be released at late 2018 for all the others.  
And the bunker. Never forget the bunker in the wailing woods. It would be a perfect sequel to ""jump"" into when you want a new game mode.

So many times I've been so close to eliminating an opponent and all I needed were a few more mats to defend myself. There are several pros and cons to this idea.

Some pros include: allows players to properly out-skill opponents who either have good weapons or shield; helps new players understand the importance of building; and helps early game capture the fortnite style of fighting better.

Some cons include: i understand Epic likes to appeal to the average player and this would be very beneficial to skilled players; not having a weapon that can break buildings quickly is a massive disadvantage (solved by lowering amount of mats given to start game); and close range combat would change immensely.(Not necessarily a bad thing, and allows players to outplay others more often)

I think this could change this game for the better(with some tweaking) and would make the early game much more bearable.",FortNiteBR

**Platform:**

&amp;nbsp;

By doing this, we can use the upvote system to measure severity/frequency and also provide the developers with more info than simply, ""Hey, this thing is not working, can you fix? Thanks."" While allowing less severe/frequent bugs some more visibility instead of flooding the thread with the same bug. If you wish to report a bug and see that it's already reported, then just reply to that comment. If you have a workaround for that bug, then comment it on that post.",FortNiteBR

I’ve won so many games because of straight up luck at this point. If the opposite team gets pressure and has to move to us, the game isn’t even difficult. Literally a coin toss.

Is it even possible for a BR game with “storm” aspects to become legitimately competitive? It seems as if RNG will be a huge factor until a company can reinvent the wheel, so to speak, with the way BR is played. Between loot and storm placement, I can pretty much tell when I’m going to win or lose.. something just isn’t feeling right. Wins and losses should never be predictable in a competitive game.

Honorary mention: grenade launchers make the last fight of the game even more boring.. just saying.

What do you guys think can be done to make this game actually skill based rather than complete luck?

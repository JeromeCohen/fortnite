20,KouiQT,1536707754,9f2e7u,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9f2e7u/spam_meta_discussion/,2,Spam meta discussion,"After the recent drum gun vault in todays 5.40 patch it seems the spam meta hasn't changed as much as I expected, this made me speculate reasons as too why this is the case and wanted to get opinions from others.

In my opinion the spam meta was created by indirect changes to the game, not exactly direct ones such as adding the p90 etc. The indirect changes that made using high firerate weapons op are the changes made to building, by this I mean how starting hp of materials has been lowered and the max hp has also been lowered causing any thing to destroy a wooden wall in 3-4 shots. Another indirect change is obviously shotgun delay which meant the only viable option would be to shotgun into SMG. 

I'm obviously an advocate for the high skill cap fortnite that we all know and love which was early season 4 and prior, however I am in no means hating on how the game is as I still play well etc and find it fun, just wanted to spark a discussion. I personally would love to see increased structure hp starting and max, reduced damage to structures by certain weapon types and POSSIBLY no delay on switching from one shotgun type to another so you can't double pump or double sawn-off. (The issue isn't the weapons it's the damage it can do to structures).

I tend to enjoy fortnite still and it's satisfying to steamroll players with the new call of duty type meta that is in place but like call of duty after a while it's not fun nor is it rewarding. S4 fortnite had a special feeling after outplaying another player and a less sour taste left after being outplayed. I'd love to see what everyone else thinks and hopefully we can create a ""buff building movement"" lol.",FortNiteBR

Everyone I come across in solo is willing to make any fight or exchange as tedious as possible, and they're able to due to all the items promoting bailing out of fights in the game. 50 vs 50 is the closest thing to a casual mode but even in that it's easy to get swamped by a few coordinated incredible players where you won't have a chance to improve.

This game is in a very good state meta wise, I applaud Epic for finally removing the drum gun, it has been a very dominant, and easy to find weapon for a while now. 

Anyway, to the point, I have been playing Fortnite on Ps4 since launch, I have been playing for an extended amount of time, and with each patch, console has literally been unplayable. I know that Ps4 may have it better then Xbox, but I have very good internet, and I play on Na-east servers, but I recieve up to a maximum of 1200 ping, and minimum of 100. I have also been getting a lot of lag spikes and its cost me a lot of games. Please Epic, if you could find some time to dedicate a patch for console players, I think we could be some better friends :)

I don't know what's all of this about, but it seems like my account is terrible attempt of people cracking accounts and somehow got to my account. This is why you should turn Two Factor Authentication/Code on; it saves your account from being scammed, hacked and such. I know, it's pretty obvious it saves you from getting hacked/scammed, but all I want is people to have it on. It's important to turn it on. It's really nothing harmful. It just helps. All I want is people to have their account safe and clean.

Trust me on this one when I say this, please! Here are [some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/muunjDB), to let you guys see that different IPs tried to enter my account the past 3 days.

I will not show the IPs as I believe it is not allowed to show other person's IP over the internet and can be dangerous for the person on the other side, but I will show the first row of every IP. 

First IP is from Iran, second IP is from Indonesia and the third IP is from Korea.

I will post a guide here on how to turn on Two Factor Authentication/Code:

**Step 1:** Go to [epicgames.com](https://www.epicgames.com), and enter your account (top right on your screen it says **""SIGN IN""**).

**Step 2:** Once you're done signing in, go to your account's settings, you can do that by simply moving your mouse over to your account's name(top right of your screen) and it will show you **""ACCOUNT**"" and **""SIGN OUT"".**

**Step 3:** Press **""PASSWORD AND SECURITY""**. It's on the left side of the screen.

**Step 4:** Scroll down until you see **""TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION"".** You'll have two options when you get there. 

One of the options is **""AUTHENTICATOR APP""**, the other option is  **""EMAIL AUTHENTICATION"".**

Choose one of the options you like better, I personally picked e-mail authentication because it feels easier to me than going into my phone just for the code.

Press **""enable""** on one of the choices you're given and do what it says.

And done! that's all you have to do to turn two factor authentication on your account.

On top of that you get your very own **""Boogie Down""** emote, only for turning it on!

I hope I helped and no one gets his/her account scammed/hacked/cracked whatsoever!",FortNiteBR

Blackout is soon to come out. Well, it seems this might be the perfect time to have our complaints heard, boys.  Things that I want:

1.  Season 6 battle pass with choices. For every skin unlocked there should be two choices to pick from. The only way to get the second is by getting currency based on placing. Therefore, rewarding players for actually playing games. 

2.  Custom match making - allow us to host full matches with our friends with the ability to fill.  

3. Shotguns - remove the pull out delay.

4. Reward kill to player(squads)- reward the kill to the player that did the most damage. Resetting once the enemy player heals. 

5. Create limited building mode - mode would have max 200 material per material.  

6. One free skin event per month - like the getaway, except we actually get the suits for free.  

7. Mythical skins  - skins unlocked based on win thresholds in solo, duo, and squads. 50 wins, 75 wins, etc.

8. Add special materials  - add special materials that can craft any weapon in the game, vaulted weapon, and mythical item.  Example: mythical shield that gives you 10 seconds to either heal or revive.  Perfect to ward off 3rd parties, after a long battle. 

9. Halloween event - after the first circle, the map becomes dark in a purge like event.  Allow 4 players to become werewolves, vampires, ghouls, or scarecrow. The goal is to collect candy and escape. 

This is the time to suggest things, as this game finds new competitors and Epic works to retain their pair base. Please add any suggestions to the comment section.

I have seen videos with the crossbow gameplay and I love the idea of infinite ammo and silent shots. I came up with an idea or two of reworking the crossbow to introduce a new way of stealthy play and to possibly bring the crossbow to life again.

I present to you two ideas of what the new crossbow could be:

1. Poison Arrows: Does ""X"" damage over ""X"" period of time to players hit by the arrow (Same idea as a stink bomb, could also be true damage, could be an op combo with stink bombs) Headshots do more damage.

This approach is great for third partying, preferably hiding in a bush and/or shooting someone and hiding to pop minis, incase you are getting rushed by a third party, as you will be doing ticking damage to them and healing yourself at the same time with bandages/minis. (Could also have a slow effect or the ability to see the player behind walls for the duration of the poison? maybe too op? not sure)

&amp;#x200B;

2. Sleeping/Paralyze Arrows: When hit with a sleeping/paralyze arrow, the player loses ""X%"" movement speed every second, upon reaching 0% movement speed, the player falls asleep or is paralyzed for ""X"" amount of time, or until damaged. (The time before being paralyzed/asleep is to give the player a chance to build or place a quick trap to protect themselves). (Headshots could do halftime or instant sleep/paralyze? too op? not sure)

&amp;#x200B;

This approach can be great for chasing someone, or to stop/delay someone rushing you, or to simply annoy a John Wick as you third party from a bush (Default skin highly recommended for this strategy). And of course there will be Diminishing Returns ( A player/Squad can't spam sleep you forever, I'll let epic decide how to balance that out)

&amp;#x200B;

My original idea is to have both 1+2 together (As in, having both Poison and Sleep/Paralyze arrows and being able to switch between them while using the same weapon), I just could not figure out a way to be able to switch between ammo quickly/efficiently.

So yesterday we got SEA Servers. Yay.. But not really. I'm located in the middle east so before SEA servers were released I was playing on Europe with 110ms ping. Not the best but the game was still a little playable. It was bearable. But with the release of the SEA servers, I was able to play connected to Singapore with 80ms ping which is more than I ever asked for (I know middle east servers are not getting implemented anytime soon). 

I have my server set on Auto so now I automatically connect to Asia. The problem is that my ping is 170ms to the server located in Tokyo which literally makes the game unplayable. What's worse is I don't have a choice now, 2/5 games I will be thrown into the Tokyo server and I don't really have much choice but to play else if I leave my stats will go downhill. 

This problem needs to be solved with one of the following solutions:

1. Make it so that choosing automatic will connect you to the lowest ping server, and if that is not available to connect you to the 2nd best server. Ex: My lowest ping available server is SEA but if that is not available, connect me to Europe and not Tokyo.

2. Let players connect to their lowest ping server irregardless of whether they have to wait or not. I don't mind waiting a minute to queue up if it will connect me to the best server and I believe this belief is held by the rest of the fortnite community.

3. Allow players to leave the game for the first X number of seconds so we can attempt to reconnect again to the lowest ping server and this happens without affecting their stats. ",FortNiteBR

Just nerf them or preferably keep them as they are. If you feel a need to change the meta back to shotguns for some strange and unreasonable ""reason"", then just buff shotguns (though not the pump, please. No one shots from full shields except for bolts and heavy snipers, thank you very much). 

If you actually think about it and don't internally shout ""SPRAY AND PRAY REEEEEEEE"" continuously, SMGs take more skill than shotguns. With SMGs you have to aim more than a couple of shots in order to get a kill or do heavy damage, unlike with shotguns, where you just have to hit one shot to wipe out more than half of a person's health if you get a headshot. And if the Drum Gun was too ""OP"" since it is an all-around weapon, then isn't the AR OP also, since it can do medium and long ranges well, and can do well at medium-short ranges, too? Why not vault the AR? Epic, stop vaulting stuff. You're literally addicted to doing it now. It started out reasonably, only vaulting things when necessary, such as the Guided Missile or Zapotron, and doing balance changes in every other instance. Now you're addicted and lazy. You vault two weapons within a matter of weeks: the drum gun, a good AR substitute which changed up the ""stale AR meta"" so many people complained about for months, and the revolver a couple weeks before, which was a gun that was in the game from the start and was useful. The Hand Cannon is literally just a more powerful revolver that uses heavy ammo, so why not vault it? Oh, right, it can be useful. Just like the revolver was.

Epic, stop being lazy. Actually *balance* things if you think they're weak or ""too good."" Don't just remove stuff left and right. 

Though if you vaulted the pump, I'd be fine. The less memories of one pumping, the better. /s for that last part",FortNiteBR

* When an enemy walks on the tile where the trap is placed, the trap closes and the enemy is hurt for 50 HP and stuck in place for 5 seconds
* User is notified of the trap being tripped (""An enemy has been trapped!"") so they can go back and eliminate their prey
* Uncommon (green) rarity

(don't hate me plzz 😢.) Long message.,"During the double shotgun meta, I absolutely loved carrying double pump around and killing those that didn't use and it was kinda easy for a time until everyone started using it. The fear of getting one pumped back then wasn't as scary as being close to someone using the double barrel now honestly since it usually took like 3-4 shots for someone to actually die after being double pumped unless it was a head shot. After the pump was nerfed to not 1 shot anymore I still used double pump because it was ""fun"" for me, everyone  good was doing it and it kinda distinguished the good players from the bad in a way. Like 1 months before the spam meta came I started using pump/tac as my main thing and it was better for me than double pump at the time, I was super good with it along with Pump/heavy though I used that way less. Not much people that I knew used smgs as their endgame setup. I'd say only 2/10 people used pump/smg at the time. I've always had two shotguns and an AR in my inventory along with two meds. This is when build battles happened a lot and people would build up to the sky. I honestly didn't like getting into build fights at all so If I didn't end the fight quick I'd just not build up with them anymore to conserve mats.

Once they made a huge delay when switch between two different shotguns I was upset that I couldn't use pump/tac anymore since I killed so much people with it. I heard people call out ""spam meta"" so I went with it too and I still say it as just a joke. I was forced to carry only 1 shotgun which was sad for me since I was use to carrying two. With everyone crying spam meta I followed their lead and cried it as well since more people were starting to use smgs. Since it was my favorite smg, I used the silenced along with the pump or heavy along with a scar and two meds still. A bit later and EVERYONE used smgs and had one in their inventories. People we're tearing through building and shooting me through my walls and it really made me rage a few times 🤣. Once the p90 was introduced and the silenced smg were nerfed I rarely ever used smgs even up until now unless it was one of the only few guns that I had in the beginning and I've noticed that less people were using them as well. But still the spam meta was a thing and knowing that building was more important than ever it forced me to get better. When people sprayed down my walls I shotgunned them in the face then build another wall, usually they stopped but if they didn't I'd usually kill them after the next shotgun to the face (unless I was below 30 health then I'd usually die). I had to build and play better, which I did. I improved alot more in this meta than I did in the other since in this one I was pushed further and had to clutch more low hp situations. After some time I noticed that smgs weren't used that much unless it was early game and the spam meta didn't seem to be a thing for me unless I was in duo or squad where I had 2 or more people shooting at me from different sides with an smg and that happened only like 3/10 games. 

Now for my caparison between the two meta's and the conclusion. I LIKE ""SMG META"" A LOT MORE! My opinion changed about which meta was better only last week when I looked back at how much better I've gotten. During double shotgun meta you had to carry two shotguns or get rekt by, there were still pump/smg during that time but not much people used it at all for it to even compete with double shotgun. Even though I loved using double shotgun it let to alot of unnecessary building to the sky and alot more camping. With this current meta and a free extra slot to use I've gotten to known how good I am with snipers. I still use shotguns every game and I don't really use smgs much, even when I pick up the p90 I don't use it most if the time. I've mostly been using pump and ars/bursts and even if a person does use an smg on me it's so easy to outplay. The moment they knock out my walls I pump them to the face and that either gets them to stop or they die if they continue unless I have low hp. People don't usually get into build fights all the way up to sky limit anymore like they did during spam meta due to fear of being shot down. A lot of people have complained about their materials fading quickly due to smg spam but if that's the case it's your fault since it means you're either hiding in a box the whole time or not taking shots. Materials during shotgun meta was wasted alot as well due to people not taking shots unless they were at the very very top. People are a lot more aggressive now and noobs are not to be messed with without building. If you noticed that I didn't mention the drum gun much in my post it's because I didn't use it unless it was in the beginning, I liked the sound that the weapon made but I sucked with it somehow. I'm more of an AR/Burst person. 

I know that many of you may have a different experience than what I had but from what I see, the spam meta no longer exists. There is no meta. ",FortNiteBR

The pumps often do 50-80 damage even for clean shots. I don't remember the last time I pumped someone for more than 140.

I just think, for smaller streamers, if they really want to grow their stream they need to get their name out as much as possible.

2: If you don’t want to dish out another 6 bucks for 1k V-Bucks, save 950 V-Bucks that you get from the battle pass. You’ll have 600 spare V-Bucks to use. If you don’t mind buying more V-Bucks, then ignore this.

3: Complete your challenges as fast as possible. You never know when servers are gonna go down or some annoying bug comes by. If you want that T100, then go for it. Don’t procrastinate.

4: If you’ve already finished the BP, and have free time on you, help others out. Tons of people want that BP XP boost grind. Doesn’t matter if it’s a friend or some random person online. It doesn’t hurt to help.

5: Try to enjoy the game. A lot of people stress about finishing the Battle Pass and once they’re done, just leave it until next season. Don’t do this. Space out your playtime, and don’t play like a madman. It’s just a game at the end of the day.

6: Help out Non-Battle Pass users if you can. There are a lot of good rewards, that are really hard to grind for them. A lot of them are working hard, but are missing out. If you have a battlepass, then play with them to give them that XP boost.

What about a new battlepass addition...? 

I'm not looking to remove the current battlepass, no, the weekly challenges are fun and mostly why I still play. What I'm suggesting is an add on, a sub-battlepass one where WINS determine your battlepass level.

Yes, this may sound crazy, but imagine if, to get to season level 100 in this new battlepass section/challenges you need to get 100 wins?

100 wins in 70 days might not sound hard for super try hards, but for casual players it's definitely a decent enough goal. They could even up the wins, make each tier based on score. So winning with less kills give you less score towards this ""competitive battlepass"" ",FortNiteBR

22 structure damage
Fall off is about 6 tiles (I think)

Purple dual pistols 
hits for 86 (if both shots land) (172 headshot)
170 Dps

Among them, the Drum Gun reigns as being a weapon capable of pressuring opponents, dealing extremely high damage in close range, and has a magazine that can fire uninterrupted for just over 5.5 seconds.

Disclaimer: I'm not advocating for the removal of a drum-gun-like weapon; I'm advocating for a buff of other weapons in order to have multiple options for short range sprayers.

My proposal is to create two categories for the sprayers (excluding Minigun, which can't really be grouped with the other weapons). Drum Gun's rarities will range from common to uncommon, LMG's from epic to legendary, and the rarities of Compact SMG and SMG will stay the same.

&amp;#x200B;

A note on bloom: I don't have numbers on bloom (the numbers I do have are based on the Fortnite Wiki's tables at [https://fortnite.gamepedia.com/Battle\_Royale\_Weapons](https://fortnite.gamepedia.com/Battle_Royale_Weapons)). I believe that bloom should be consistent among these weapons, so perhaps it's a good idea to reduce LMG bloom to match with Drum Gun's.

&amp;#x200B;

This is more a sketch than a strict guideline, but I think it creates a reasonably well-balanced set of weapons but still gives each weapon its own flavor.

&amp;#x200B;

The last weapon I want to mention is the minigun. To be honest, it's such a strange weapon and I don't know what to do with it. Perhaps a vault, perhaps a reduction in rarity, perhaps no change at all. It's like the double barrel shotgun - overwhelmingly strong in certain situations, but completely useless in others.",FortNiteBR

Why would we want V-buck rewards for wins/kills: Players would be rewarded for wins, this would push players to play more often, and give them more reason to increase skill.
Why skins for rewards is a good idea: This would also push players to play more, and will most likely increase skilful play.
Ideas
- 1-5 V-bucks per win so Fortnite still makes their $$$
- Fortnite could also add a V-buck reward for kills for example for every 5 kills you receive 1 V-buck (Pushing players to increase skilful play and become better at the game)
- Skins are rewarded at very hard to reach goals for example *play 10000 matches* or *get 30 kills in a match* (Skins would be very hard to get, and there wouldn't be many of them (So Fortnite still gets their $$$)

- less fall damage
- slightly faster when running (but requires acceleration to the max speed)
- none or less slowdown during reload
- dive slightly faster when holding down
- move faster when on gliders
- slightly better aim with specific guns/one each so players have to really choose
- wider rocket/explosive area or damage.
- burning shotgun damage, added damage over time with specific weapons
- slightly more max health/shield
- slight resistance to explosives
- % based less build material cost
- % based more material harvesting
- last stand pistol shooting when we're downed.. I mean, COD going to have their own BR anyway. 
- better turning on vehicles? faster if driving vehicles
- very close range infravision during nighttime
- better higher luck with loot
- uses less ammo on % per shot

1: Aim assist not working after being turned off and back on again 

2: Sensitivity not saving in smaller blocks than 1.0

These have both been reported countless times through multiple channels (in-game bug reports, official bug reporting forums, reddit bug report megathreads, reddit PM's, Discord PM's).

____
 
Here are the bug reports on the official forums, dating back to the 11th of March:

1: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/208994-3-3-0-aim-assist-not-working-on-turning-it-back-on-once-turned-off

2: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa/214562-3-3-0-sensitivity-not-saving

____

1: The bug report for aim assist is the ~~12th~~ 10th [most replied](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/bug-reports/battle-royale-aa?filter_sort=replies) bug report on the entire forum. EPIC employees were commenting trying to get it fixed at the start of the thread, and were active for the first two pages. Once people had reported their attempted fix hadn't worked, they went silent. There are now 16 pages on the thread, and there has been not one word from EPIC since. It is still sitting on [INVESTIGATING] to this day, over 5 months later.

2: The thread for the sensitivity bug was first made in early March, and EPIC have still yet to acknowledge it, aside from a community moderator commenting a month after it was first posted saying they were adding it to the bug tracker (great news, you would think).
Three months after the initial report the same moderator comes in and says 
&gt;This issue is still around. I'm adding it to the tracker again and I've sent this over to somebody at Epic. 

Two weeks after that, he replies again with 
&gt;I just checked, this is being worked on. I guess it was more complicated than originally thought?

That was almost three months ago, and there hasn't been any update from the mods or a patch to actually fix it since then.

_____

So here we have two cases of EPIC knowingly ignoring bugs for extended periods of time. We have confirmation that these are indeed bugs, and proof that EPIC are aware of them.

It is not acceptable for any developer to knowingly ignore bugs, let alone for the #1 game in the world.
Proper and effective processes for reporting and fixing bugs should be an absolute given, and bugs as simple as changing sensitivity and aim assist should be a first priority for any shooter.

All I'm asking for is some communication. If it is a difficult bug to work out, then tell us! I would much rather hear you are working on it than nothing at all.

Please EPIC, help us! I really want to play your awesome game again 

_____

**TL;DR: Two bugs have existed since season three, EPIC are aware of them yet continue to ignore them. Not cool, man.**

I was staying at a music camp at a small college near my house (I was a part of the festival) and brought my PS4 with me so that I could game a little in between practice sessions. Every now and then I'd pull up fortnite and relax, have a little fun and what not. About two weeks into the four week festival, another camp moves into the same college. And here's the catch, IT'S A CAMP OF 369 KIDS. And I'm not talking highschool kids as if I'm some old bat (I'm 20) I am talking early middle school kids.

Now I get it, you're away from home, you haven't had a chance to play any video games, so if you see someone gaming it's kind of fun to chill and just watch. I've definitely done this before and it's not abnormal so cool, whatever, the kids are obviously happy that there is someone playing their favorite game in the building they're staying in (we were all staying in the same dorm building) and decide to chill and watch.

So what's the problem here? Well for starters, there were about 40-50 kids a space that's meant for like 20 people tops, and on top of this all of the kids have been outside for hours playing in 80 degree weather and I'll be damned if each one of them didn't smell like motherfuckin' assssssssss. So, I'm trying to play fortnite in peace to relax and I know have 40-50 kids trying to tell me how to play the damn game.

""Pick up that gun""

""Oh that's a shotgun""

""Shoot him!""

""Man you need to aim""

""I could do better""

""Build""

So now I have an army of kids who smell like dirty laundry all telling me how to play while I'm just trying to relax. But then it got bad. It was like these kids started having withdrawal symptoms (keep in mind this is DAY ONE of their camp) from the game. They started saying shit like:

""Man let me show you how to play, I can do better""

""Hey let me do a game I haven't played all day""

""Come on just one game and I'll give it right back""

""I swear just one game that's all I want""

So at this point I'm just irritated but whatever I'm not going to let these kids stop me from relaxing. So there I am trying to focus on my game with 50 kids yelling in a space that's way too small for all of us and one of these little fuckers starts preaching. AND I MEAN FULL ON PREACHING THE WORD OF GOD UNTO ALL OF US. She goes off about how fortnite is evil and it's just a game about killing people which is bad because people are dying. And then she whips a goddamn bible out of her bag saying:

""This is what ya'll need to be doing, and not that!""

And at this point I pretty much just want to die because all hell has broken lose (pun intended). But I wanted to have some revenge before I rage quit and left so I decided I would do one more game. I found all the best loot I could, got a couple kills, walked to the middle of pleasant park, dropped all of my loot, and started running after people with my pickax. These kids went ballistic.

""WHAT ARE YOU DOING!""

""YOU COULD STILL WIN GO PICK UP YOUR LOOT""

""PICKAX ISN'T A GOOD WEAPON YOU'RE GOING TO DIE""

I soon die, shut off the PS4, take my controllers so they can't use them, grab my PS4, and head back to my room to sulk about how my relaxation time was ruined, but at least I got one bit of payback before I left.",FortNiteBR

Here’s why I think this.

They gave the OG users the *middle finger* by re releasing almost EVERY highly sought after OG skin. Now, I realize business is business but you’re nuts if you think they didn’t know that us OG users wanted to be able to stick out. They flipped us off, I mean if it weren’t for us, Epic wouldn’t be where it is. We were the ones who told our friends about this new free to play game that was so awesome. We were the ones who paid them when it literally was thought of as pointless or stupid (to put money into a free game).

So how do we fix this? Calling cards? Tags? Ranks? Look, I know it’s silly to want everyone to know you were here first but let’s be honest, there’s a market for OG ANYTHING. This isn’t about selling my account because I have the Skull Trooper skin. This is about standing out and in a way, striking fear into opponents all while looking cool.

Just like the people who have any star athlete or hall of famer’s rookie card.

 I propose a ranking system. Basically, you start at rank 100. When you get 5 wins you rank up and you  get a reward for doing so. I don’t know what this reward will be. Maybe you get vbucks every 5 ranks? Maybe you get victory tokens which can be spent in a victory shop? Maybe you get all sorts of things, from XP, tiers, and cosmetics. I really don’t know what the reward will be.. but the rewards will get better  the higher the rank. Anyway, you get 5 wins and you are now rank 99. You get 10 wins you become rank 98. 15 wins... you get the idea. Again.. the numbers will need A LOT of tweaking. Maybe you get a skin at rank 1 or something I’m not sure.

&amp;#x200B;

anyway, i'm not a very good player, and people know that. i'm in the fortnite discord often looking for someone to play with, but usually i don't find anyone because of the whole ""kd must be 4+"" and stuff like that. when i do find someone, i usually leave them disappointed because of how bad i am and sometimes they even leave.

&amp;#x200B;

honestly though, i came to say that maybe, just MAYBE, people should start giving us ""bad"" players a chance?? i mean, it would obviously help to play with someone who could give advice and stuff...

Breaking News!: The Durrs have declared war on the Tomatoheads for allegedly kidnapping their Grill Sergeant Jonesy! The full story to follow.

Captain Durr, the owner of Durr Burger and leader of the Durrs spoke out against the Tomatoheads for kidnapping and brainwashing their Grill Sergeant Jonesy, and that if they don’t return him, they will destroy Tomato Temple. King Tomato, the owner of Tomato Temple Brick Oven Pizza responded by saying that the Tomatoheads did nothing and that the Durrs have no right to destroy their property. Captain Durr then simply stated that war is starting, and the Tomatoheads will pay.

Well on a lighter note, Power Cord is back for a new concert in Paradise Palms! People everywhere are scrambling to get tickets, which have become impossible to find. But one person, Bright Bomber, a pop star, has a different opinion on the concert, saying that the music is terrible and that her concert, which is also upcoming, will be superior. Fans aren’t so sure though.

“Well last time I went to Bright Bomber’s concert it got attacked by the Visitor, and the time before that Wukong took over the place,” said one skeptical fan. “I mean her music is great and all, but I’m not risking my life again.” 

Power Cord and Bright Bomber’s rivalry is a long running thing, a fan of both musicians says. Who’s concert will really be better? I guess we’ll find out.

For our last story of the day we have the new fishing shop in Tilted Towers! On its grand opening, people were backed up to Loot Lake waiting to be let in. Once everyone were allowed inside, people were amazed. That was until a person only known as the Ace broke in and stole thousands of dollars worth of items. The owner of the shop spoke up, saying that he wants this mysterious Ace to be brought down. Who is this person and why did they rob the new fishing shop? Nobody knows.

Stay tuned for more in the next issue of the Fortnite News Network!",FortNiteBR

Problem is that now that the skin is released and everyone has bought it what's the point? Where is the appeal? Probably like 90% of people that bought it, bought it because it used to be rare while the other 10% actually like the skin itself. I just find it weird as to why so many people want it now, considering that most of them aren't even buying it because of it's looks but because of it's previous rarity.

I get to end game 1v1, and the guy is posted up with his best recreation of the most beautiful Seattle Skyline, and i’m just like fuck my g, you can have the win.  There is no such thing as a gunfight. It’s build the twin towers and first one to fall off loses. C4 and clingers were nerfed and don’t do nearly as much damage as they should. You can’t just shoot through their build because with turbo building, they just hold whatever piece they want built and it automatically places it .0001 seconds after you destroy it and not even a bullet can slip through.

As in, I get them low through our build fight, and they dip to the bottom, set up a 1x1, and just sit there holding turbo build on their walls.

When this season started, SMGs and Drum Guns were designed to shoot fast enough to circumvent this which was definitely a much needed answer, but lately it seems like turbo building has been faster than the fire rate, creating this turtle problem again.

It sucks because if you don't have any explosives to combine with the spam you are SOL, the turbo building is too fast and they just sit there going through all their mats waiting for you to get third partied.

Honestly, I feel like there is a much better answer to this problem in general: just make it so that after placing like 10 pieces in the same spot within a 3 second time frame, there is a diminishing return on being able to build in that spot (like 1 second maybe).

Would be a great feature to make miniguns deadly agains't buildings, but still not for spamming someone till he loses materials.

My cat, [Luna](https://i.imgur.com/rwq5u5p.jpg), had come up to me on the couch like she usually did because she wanted to cuddle with me and get scratches. I ignored her and only gave her a passing scratch because I was in the middle of a game and someone else had finally landed Haunted Hills and I needed those kills. Didn’t get the kill, so I kept going and going. 

On Thursday, I found out Luna had severe cancer in her liver. On Saturday, I watched her pass right before me, without medical assistance, because she didn’t make it to her euthanasia appointment and it was the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever experienced. Now all I can think about is how she just wanted some scratches and I wanted to complete a challenge. 

This isn’t a stab at Fortnite. It’s not the game’s fault and I don’t blame Epic or anything like that. Playing some more is what’s helping me keep my mind off things a little.

Changing a \*Windows\* setting has made a huge difference for me as a PC mouse player.  Know how when you try to spin around quickly to fire at a player behind you, but what felt like the right distance to move your mouse somehow causes you to wildly over-rotate and get completely misaligned - over and over until you die?  It's because Windows itself has a mouse pointer setting called ""Mouse Acceleration"" which is more or less designed to dynamically increase your mouse's sensitivity when you move it very quickly, under the assumption that you're not trying to be precise at just that moment &amp; are instead just trying to zip over to the other side of the screen.  We don't consciously notice it during normal use of Windows, and in fact we unconsciously probably appreciate what it does, but it straight-up sabotages you in a game where you need to be both quick and precise at the same time.  Here's how you turn it off, courtesy of Metabomb:

1. Type “mouse settings” into your Windows search bar. (or just navigate to mouse settings by whatever means you prefer)
2. Select “Change your mouse settings”.
3. Click “Additional mouse options”.
4. Select the “Pointer Options” tab.

Okay after about 3 months of playing I just got my first solo win and I'd like to help out people asking how to get their first solo win, as I've been there.

I'm not trying to act like a pro who can make you win every match, frankly, I'm garbage. I'm just saying how I won this one match after many tries, it may not be the best strategy since it took so long, but you do you.

​

I've mainly landed unpopulated areas, gotten decent loot and then gotten to battles, rather than picking a fight with a grey AR and a green tac. One of my favourite spots is the tower in lonely lodge, then rotating to the mansion, as there's many chests and you can easily get max wood/brick at the mansion.

I also usually don't start fights I don't think are worth it, like if someone is far away I'm not gonna go at them with an AR, I usually just go my separate way and let the pros beat the pros. Take in to consideration if the loot is worth the health lost, if you aren't too good at avoiding shots. I have come second A LOT. What I recommend in top 5 is, don't be nervous to get in to a fight, but pick your battles, if there's two people having an intense build battle and you're not a good builder, either leave it or shoot out their structure from the bottom. If someone is ramping over to you, ramp higher.

Oh, I see a lot of people saying ""drop tilted and pvp until you get good"" I honestly don't like doing that, i prefer gearing up then getting in to actual fights or build battles, but if you wanna be a pvp god who plays one minute every twenty minutes and sits in the lobby and battle bus for the rest, I don't mind.

I utilize playground a lot too, I mainly mess around with friends or do target practice with certain guns, but for at least ten minutes every game I practice basic things that I haven't quite mastered but are crucial (like 1x1s and wall/ramp)

I also changed my binds recently, binds are important, I see a lot of people bind wall and ramp to Q/E but that didn't work for me as I'm used to E being my ""use"" key in every game ever. Change your binds. They won't feel right for a few days to a week, but you will notice how much better it is after time.

Anyway, sorry for the long post and if it wasn't very informative, just wanted to share my experience as I have made posts before asking how I can get my first solo win.",FortNiteBR

So I'm pretty sure that the reason behind the deactivation of my account is because I spoofed my MAC address, causing Epic to believe that I am account sharing. That is fine, it's a reasonable assumption and I don't blame them for the ban itself, I can just appeal it. HOWEVER, it has been five days since my account deactivation and I have not received any indication it has been deactivated because of a ban or otherwise. I have since sent an email every day to Fortnite Support and have yet to receive a response. From what I can tell from ban threads, players who have their accounts banned receive an email saying the duration and reason for the ban, as well as an in-game message. I have received either of those. With a company that made 1 billion in revenue in basically half a year, it's time for them to upgrade their god-awful player support. I have seen plenty of threads from players who complain about the lack of interest from customer support to help them in any way, even if the ban cannot be lifted. I play another game owned by Deca Games and they responded to my ticket within a day, and after I sent a reply a follow-up email came within the next day. They are a small indie company that has maybe fifty people if that on their team. Why is it taking so long for my requests to be responded to?",FortNiteBR

150,MargateSteve,1535369513,9ao5c0,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9ao5c0/reporting_teammates/,1,Reporting teammates,"It is often commented that the Squad modes (mainly 50v50) are full of toxic try-hards and those who just find fun in being twats. Stealing your loot, blocking your runs etc.

For me, these people are as bad as cheats as they are reducing the fun of the game for others but it is impossible to report them. The one time I did try to report (running away from the storm after looting for too long, again, and a teammate kept building walls in front of me,slowing me down, until I got caught in it) not only did I not know the teammates name but while writing my message the game ended and I was thrown back to the lobby.

So I emailed Epic with a suggestion. They initially replied that they take things like this seriously but the rest of the email suggested little would be done. Then got a follow up email that was quite good with suggestions including sending emails with screenshots/videos.

The idea I sent was that at any point during a game, you can mark an incident for reporting. Once back in the lobby, if you have incidents from the last game, there will be a message giving you the option to send a report with an explanation. If you do not report them in that lobby session, they are removed.

Once Epic reviews and confirms them against the code of conduct, the player could receive a warning that any further instances could result in a ban. I genuinely think that the toxicity would reduced fairly quickly if the threat of a ban was over people’s heads.


When I sent the email I included some (by no means all) the incidents of toxicity either myself or my daughter had over a two week period which would have been no more than around 30 games. The % of incidents to games is fairly high and as a result, my daughter stopped playing. I have listed them again below to show why it has got so painful to play. 

Before anyone says it though, these people are not legends. They are dicks.

Built steps to smash through side of roof to get to chest. As wall disappeared team mate knocked steps out and built new ones once my daughter fell and took the chest. Must be a dozen times something like this has happened.

Daughter built platform to chest in a boat on Loot Lake. As she built the last bit, a teammate smashed it and jumped in the boat to take the loot while she was in the water.

Many occasions of a teammate building walls around you when wounded and instead of reviving, danced until we died and took our loot. Someone done this to me the other day less than a minute after I revived them and gave them a med kit.

In one of the stone huts I got trapped in there by a teammate standing in the doorway. I knocked a wall down and they built another to keep me trapped in there. Each time i knocked their new wall down they built another until I was actually in the storm. As they ran just ahead of the storm they kept building walls to stop me running and obviously I died.

Many other occasions of teammates slowing you down for no reason by continually building structures in your path. I often loot for too long and have to run away from the storm. This is not easy when walls keep appearing.

In the heat of battle, was on a tower next to a teammate, both with snipers and enemies in sight. Each time the teammate took a shot, they built a wall in front of me to stop me taking one so they could get the kills.

Couple of occasions of building four walls around the balloon landing spot only for a team mate to put a roof on it and/or some stairs to catch it higher.

Many occasions of teammates knocking ramps out as you a running up them, although this could be new players there are times when the player runs over to loot you so quickly, they clearly knew what they were doing.

In a battle with 5 opponents in Shifty Shafts a teammate kept shooting out my protective wall so I was more visible than them and became the main target.

A teammate dropped a chug jug and as I was full heath but low on shield, dropped my med kit for them. The teammate then picked up both items.

Four teammates surrounded me and built a big structure around me that I had no way of finding my way out of. Building was going on for over two minutes.

On cliff by the side of the river, teammate standing higher up threw stink bomb to where I was standing. This alerted opponents to where I was and they rushed me. The teammate then picked them off with a sniper while they were inspecting my loot. Basically I was sacrificed.

I made a video describing my method: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy11wBcX2Dk&amp;feature=youtu.be

TL;DW

I used the formula Surface Area (Acres) * Depth(Ft) * 326,000 Gallons/acre-ft. I obtained the surface area of Loot Lake by placing brick floors along the shore and then wood floors covering Loot Lake. I found online that each tile is 5.12m x 5.12m when placed horizontally. I used a total of 22,580 mats or placed down 2,258 wooden floors which nets a total surface area of 59,192.1152m or 637,139.6253ft or 14.6267 Acres. 

I also found the depth of the water by measuring the height of the water in photoshop compared to the height of the wall in the water and the height of one wall. With the wall being 3.84m, I found the wall in the water to be 1.40m and the water to be 0.8768m in depth or 2.8765 ft. 

14.63 Acres * 2.88 ft * 326,000 gallons/Acre-ft = 13,716,037.24 Gallons or 51,921,948.7 Liters. 

Image: https://imgur.com/a/HaXTX4d

*Note*: This is most likely an underestimate because I did cover up a small amount of water with brick. I also didn't account for the water at the shore. I wanted to measure these by going into photoshop and finding the area by using the amount of pixels that the water occupies compared to one floor tile, but this would have taken way too long.

The pistols don’t really have recoil at all it just gets a really big crosshairs when you trigger finger the fire button. I honestly would use the pistols more if they allow trigger finger firing. Like when they didn’t add first shot accuracy the suppressed pistol at the time it was literally most used weapon for 2 months straight because it had the best headshot damage multiplier and did 2 damage less than the epic and legendary scar for headshot. (Epic scar: 70  legendary scar: 72)                    
 (Epic pistol: 68 legendary pistol: 70) I personally want pistols to have no bloom at all because you are limited with 16 bullets and it literally takes half your clip to kill someone. Also even if they removed the bloom from pistols I don’t think the whole meta would change like how it changed with the buffs with the smgs and introduction of the drum gun.

And even though I’m garbage, I think Epic games hasn’t been making the best changes. The game’s popularity is attracting new players. Which is causing a problem for Epic. They have to choose between making it welcoming for new players, or hanging on to old ones. My solution is-

New Players: Upon playing for the first time, players are put in a playground-mode style arena. They have unlimited ammo, lives, and more. New players can battle until they can pose a threat. Once they’re combat ready and can grasp the building. They are sent to common rank and given a V-buck reward

Ranking System: After every match, factors of your gameplay will be judged. Such as kills, accuracy, building, and teamwork. After ten matches, you will be assigned a rank. Every rank gives rewards for maintaining or improving your rank. Not playing or doing bad in matches will lower your rank (unless playing un-ranked). 

Diamond Raider: The skin of a true warrior. Given only after maintaining weeks in Diamond Rank (highest rank). Modeled after Arnold Schwarzenegger from terminator 2. But his jacket is lined with glowing diamond. And a player-chosen flag and number is etched into his back.

3) **Bargaining** \- 

&gt;Well... if I would have taken the goddamn heavy sniper over the bolt I could have 1 hit that guy... and if only I dropped my medkits for some splodes... 

4) **Depression** \- 

&gt;I \*\*\*\*ing suck at this game... why can't I be like all the other pros and hit sick bounce plays. Maybe I will uninstall. I don't... I can't... one more game...

5) **Acceptance** \- 

&gt;Well... No chance for me to go pro so I guess I am just going to go ahead and play some 50v50..

​

To my understanding theres no effect from thanking the bus driver, So I came up with an idea with how each time you thank the bus driver 0.01$/Euro cent gets donated to charity.

After each game ends, it calculates the amount of ''thanks'' the  bus driver recieved.  so if you have 70/100 players that thanked the bus driver it would total to 70 Cents per game going away to a charity that EPIC chose.

&amp;#x200B;

Or simply  every 5 ''Thank you's'' would be 1 cent

The charity changes each season, for example season 6 could be towards cancer research, the next season could be donation to a brain illness research etc..

​

I think that could be a neat addition to really boost positivity too fortnites image and its player base/devs, and give a proper reason to thank the bus driver before jumping out!

Most of the time I will shoot someone once with a nasty sniper shot or get a good burst in from a rifle then they just build a damn castle in 3 seconds. I like the game but I find myself subconsciously avoiding conflict sometimes because every battle ends the same way with wasting 200+ materials on one person.

I almost miss the old days where everyone (including myself) kind of sucked so building was more for building a fort and hunkering down on the circle and waiting for people to come to you. Or vice versa when you had to siege another team for control of the circle.

TLDW: **Epic Game’s placement of the Durr Burger and Loot Llamas in real life were not done for publicity. An ARG was also run when people visited the real life Durr Burger, involving a group of agents containing the anomaly found at the Durr Burger. The actors that played the agents gave you a phone number that when dialed would give you a series of sounds that when displayed as a spectrogram gave codes that  add to the mystery. There are still many things that remain unsolved. The lack of effort by the community to solve this ARG is most likely why this season feels empty: we’ve been ignoring the real world component.**   
Here: I will be uploading any ‘breaks in the case’: things that expand the ARG.   
One: the phone number that is called, when 8 is pressed on the phone while the call is going, will switch to someone asking for the ‘first few letters of the person you are trying to find.’   Two: u/nickg920 has confirmed the phones area code places it in Estherville Iowa.   
Three: u/akithetsar zombies an old thread that gives us a lot of information, here are the highlights: during the Durr Burger ARG event, a special emphasis was placed on walkie talkies. They successfully convinced someone in the area to go to the area with walkie talkies, and chatted with the guards there for a bit to find out more information. Our guy on the field live-streamed this and the recording can be found at https://youtu.be/1QVH-uQj-nE. Another guy also went with similar results: https://www.instagram.com/maddythegsd. The walkie talkie gives out signals!   
Four: please, go view the whole thread by u/akithetsar. It gives a lot of info that most people didn’t know at the time.   
Five: as you remember, when the number 8 is dialed as the extension for the phone number given by the agents, it asks you to dial the letters of the name of the person you’re looking for. According to u/iiXSuperZeroXii, he gets a different noise when he dials 387.   
That is everything for now. I’ll be updating if anything is found. I really want to find the actual end of this ARG, so let’s do it together!",FortNiteBR

I just called my banks and these two transactions were not flagged as fraudulent by my bank. Epic's systems just decided to flag me as a naughty boy and put me in timeout. What's really stressing me out is that I my account is not coming up on Fortnite tracker. If my account is banned after all these hours and all that money I put in to it, then that will be quite depressing. I have been going through a rough patch in my life and playing fortnite is one of my coping mechanisms. With all the exciting stuff happening with the season coming to an end, it will be really sad to miss out on the action. I just unlocked the Ragnarok Skull helmet in the last two days and I play solo, so no exp boosts. You can imagine how much time I've put in to Fortnite.

Here's a screenshot of the two emails I've received related to the two transactions:

Today we will find out what the hypotenuse of the Fortnite Battle Royale map and island is.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, what is a [hypotenuse](https://imgur.com/a/k6tUgAG)? 

 *the longest side of a right triangle, opposite the right angle*

&amp;#x200B;

If one stride = one unit (plain walking) and six strides are equal to one wood platform (from edge to edge) so therefore the hypotenuse of [one wood platform](https://imgur.com/a/Aia6ZRy), is six units, but we aren’t done yet…

&amp;#x200B;

Each quadrant on the map (for example H9 or A1) fits 48 (corner to corner) platforms. Since each platform is 6 units, so that makes…

48 x 6 = 288

Each [quadrant](https://imgur.com/a/eXCUORI) is 288 units.

&amp;#x200B;

There are 100 quadrants on the map, for a hypotenuse of 10 quadrants.

r/https://imgur.com/a/IeC75mR

Of the 10 quadrants, each quadrant being 48 platforms in between, we can do the math to assume…

48 x 6 = 288 x 10 = 2880 units

The hypotenuse of the fortnite map is 2,880 units. 

But how much of that is water? 

For the data, we will start at the beginning of the map near Greasy Grove (C8) and go to the end of the map at Risky Reels (I1.) 

The number of quadrants between those two areas is about 8, but most of two of those quadrants is water, (not counting loot lake.)

For quadrant C8, I [covered](https://imgur.com/a/OIFaueU) the land parts over the quadrant,  there are 9216 spaces for one full quadrant, 2949 of those platforms are on land for quadrant C8, which means that 36% of that one quadrant is covered in land, even though is is 2949 units, the hypotenuse is 368 units.

For quadrant I1 I did the same thing, but it was much less, only 26 platforms covered the land, and 0.004% is land. 

The hypotenuse of quadrant C8 would be 420 platforms, while I8 would be around 7.

Using this data, we have,

6 full quadrants, 288 platforms across, or 1368 units

The 36% quadrant, which would be  61 platforms, or 368 units

The 0.004% quadrant is 7 platforms, so 42 units

Add them together…

*The hypotenuse of the Fortnite Battle Royale island… is 1778 units!* 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

The hypotenuse of the Fortnite Island is 1778 units (steps)",FortNiteBR

I then saw a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9a889o/can_anybody_confirmdeny_whether_or_not_the_galaxy/) asking if anyone had tested if the skin really was limited to 1 device. So I tested this last night on a secondary account and about 19 hours later, again, I just found out that it worked. I have now redeemed 2 skins on one Tablet. Here's how I did it.

1. Factory reset your device. (This is the only way I have tested so far, but it might be worth a shot to just try and delete Fortnite and make a new Samsung account)
2. Sign into your tablet or device with a different email than the one used before.
3. Make a new Samsung account
4. Once your tablet is available to use, google Epic Games Fortnite and select download. Be sure you tap on ""Samsung"" when prompted to download the installer.
5. Open up the Fortnite app, login, and play three games.
6. wait 24-48 hours and you will be rewarded with the skin (19 hours in my case and even less for other)

&amp;#x200B;

imo this is why so many ppl have been able to get the skin from display devices at their local retailers. Those devices reset them self and are then signed into many different users trying to redeem the skin. I don't necessarily think this is right, simply because the reason the skin is so desirable is that not everyone has it, but I figured everyone on here with questions would appreciate the info. So in conclusion, if you care enough about getting this skin, you can get it off any Tab S4 or Note9 and if your friend or someone you know and trust has one of these devices, they can redeem it for you.

&amp;#x200B;

ps. Please dont ask me to do it for you. It's quite a process to do it just once, if you want it enough go to your local retalier.

This is nowhere near the audience size that Ninja or Daequan or any other high-level streamer has, however I still had an audience that slowly watched me get more and more upset with every update that Epic released over the past 3 months (using a throwaway account for this post, but if you know who I am, you know who I am). I am not posting this because I'm mad, frustrated, or infuriated, but because I'm genuinely upset. Fortnite, the game that I built my entire audience around, has turned into something that I always feared it would. What do I mean by this?



*Catering to the majority of the player-base.*  

  

As a company, I can understand why Epic has begun to make winning their Battle-Royale easier. More players winning = more play time = buying more skins. What fun is it if you can't feel the satisfaction of seeing ""Victory Royale"" at least *sometimes?* How can we make our audience feel this satisfaction more often if they're not skilled enough to win?  

  

*50v50*  

  

When was the last time 50v50 *wasn't* available? Keeping the last paragraph in mind, what happens to a battle-royale if the less-skilled players are all in 50v50, while the more-skilled players are playing in regular modes? The classic spread of players ranging from ""bots"" to pros switches to a range of amateur to pro players. This *would* have little to no effect on the game in say, season 2, but what has changed? Again, catering to the majority of players.

  

*Turn Fortnite Into a Spray-and-Pray*  

  

Let's add more weapons that shoot faster. If your aim is poor, that's okay, 50% of the time you will kill your opponent no matter their skill level.  

  

*Nerf Shotguns*  

  

The only weapon in the game that that takes a moderate amount of skill to use besides the sniper. I say moderate because even a ""bot"" can get lucky and hit a headshot, but...  

  

Let's remove double-pump. Remove one-shot kills. Nerf damage. Remove double-shotgunning of any kind. Nerf damage more. Etc. Etc.  

  

*Nerf Building*  

  

This is the worst one for me and many others. The best, most unique part of your battle-royale, and you want to nerf it. The one thing that makes a player truly skilled at this game is building. So...  

  

Let's reduce building health. Make llamas drop less materials. Make the fully-automatic weapons tear through materials like it's straw. Slowly make the amount of resources dropped from farming become less and less. Make explosives destroy more.  

  

  

  

I feel like I don't need to keep going on and on, but I just wish this game would feel the same way it used to. The most skilled players could win lots of games because *they were the best.* And the less skilled players tried their hardest to get better so they could win. It doesn't feel like a battle-royale anymore, it feels like a casino-royale, because nowadays your chances of winning might as well be up to luck.

The flamethrower, a pinnacle of human suffering and a universally deadly weapon. I mean, has anyone said: “You know what we don’t need? Flamethrowers.” yeah, not likely. (PM me if you find an example...)

I’ll get straight to the point, the flamethrower fires a cone of flame straight forward, or alternatively an opposite mode fires a stream of gasoline which is affected by gravity, it does a lot more impact damage then the fire (I’ll get into those juicy numbers shortly) and leaves a puddle of napalm, damaging and setting fire to anyone inside it, at 5 damage every 0.5 seconds.

Afterburn: After any contact  by the flamethrower you will slowly take damage, an afterburn effect, or DOT. This does 5 damage every 0.5 seconds for 2.5 seconds, the character will noticeably have a flame on their person, looking identical to the flame when hit by a fire husk in STW. Not only that, but while on fire the screen will pan left and right, damping up every 0.5 seconds till basically it’s turning your camera sideways. Again, accompanied by horrific screaming. This will stop building and make it very difficult to do much of anything really. 

The flamethrower has it’s own ammo type, gasoline. Gasoline looks like a red Jerry can, not to dissimilar from the one from PUBG, (obviously more cartoony,) and when picked up will make a sort of sloshing sound. Each find gives 10 “ammo.”

The first attack, the cone (The non gasoline one) consumes ammo at 1 point of “Fuel” every 0.5 seconds, and taking into account the rarity AND 50 canister size, it burns through this ammo extremely quickly. 

The napalm spray, on the other hand, consumes TWO points of fuel per shot, (for reference this attack fires twice per second) and again, burns the ammo extremely quickly. 

Now, how to alternate between these attacks? Well, whatever button you use to ADS will do the trick. The cone, is the fire button and the spray is the ADS button. (This does mean however,it can’t zoom in but who is zooming in with a flamethrower in the first place.) 

Now, material damage, it can destroy a wood wall in around 0.2 seconds with the first spray, HOWEVER with the second attack it just filters through the holes.  (Obviously the afterburn effect is applied to wood too.)

Now for brick, the first attack does absolutely nothing, and neither does it do anything on metal. However the gasoline on the other hand DOES damage them, at the same rate it damages players. This is very little but setting structures on fire can be very distracting to a player. Not only that, but the flame is extremely bright and can be seen from a LONG distance, around the same distance a sniper shot can be heard. 

And finally, the reload,... 8 seconds. It’a extremely long and cumbersome, but what do you expect for such a high power weapon?!

It’s rarity comes in every single one except grey, green having 8 second reload, blue having 7, purple having 6, and the gold having 5, one thing about the gold, ammo consumption for the gasoline attack is the same as the cone, being 1 point, (Just to make it that little bit better) also the cone can reach 5 metres in distance while the jet can reach 8. 

Well, sorry for the long post, what do you think?

My younger sister is running for V.P. of her freshmen high school class and is currently making posters to hang around her school. She asked me if I had any ideas for her and I told her to make some FortNite themed posters since this is the most popular game out right now. Her eyes lit up and she realized that was an amazing idea. She loves the game herself and plays it with our cousin almost every day.  


Here's the catch, I know very little about the game and don't have a lot to offer her in terms of ideas/slogans revolving around the game. I've watched the game streamed before but know almost nothing about the map and the easter egg memes in the game. (I know there has to be a battle bus/school bus idea somewhere, maybe something about a llama).  


I was hoping the FortNite hive mind of reddit could help my sister out and give her some ideas for posters she could make.

Epic refuses to get back to him and won't speak to him and even give him a reason why he got banned. They don't know how bad they messed up our group's dynamic. When the boys get online to play Fortnite, he sometimes doesn't get called because he's not on and can't play. And when we do add him tot he call he's playing another game while we're playing Fortnite. I can assure you, he hasn't done anything wrong, why won't Epic do anything about this? I'm really going to look into what we can do legally because what they have done is a crime I'm sure. He's spent around $300 dollars on this game and you take his money and ban him with no word? That isn't how this works, if a person has spent money with you, even though the game is free, if they spent money, you are OBLIGATED to tell them why you won't allow them to play anymore.

Unless i’m banned or I did something wrong, this is ridiculous. Just to put it out there too, I have never used ANY exploits nor have I used 3rd party systems to cheat or do anything to jeopardize my account. 

I also know this for a fact because I can play on my account normally on my PS4 and my iPhone. However, when I try log in with my PC it simply says: “Unable to login with Fortnite servers. Please try again later.” Or the other one that says something about “platform restrictions”. 

Here’s what I have done: 
• flushed my DNS, through cmd 
• Changed my DNS to Google’s DNS
• Restarted my router/wifi usb 
• Uninstalled and re-installed Epic Games launcher &amp; Fortnite
• Reset my password 2-3 times
• Already had 2FA months ago

I have pretty much done everything that is supposedly a fix, but to no avail. I have contacted Epic support centre but I emailed them on the weekend so i’ll have to wait I guess. Hopefully they wont be hopeless like I am right now. 

I just wanted to ask you all, being able to play my main account on both PS4 and iOS, but not on my PC.. Is this an ISP (internet service provider) problem? Do I need to call my internet provider and see if they can help? Or is this an issue with Epic Games, and I should email them to ask for help and see if they can help me solve this problem.

Some I play with 10ms, some with 150+, and I decided to trace all the routes to see why do I keep getting this inconsistency.

First thing, I entered in a high ping game, and used a tool called ""Live TCP UDP Watch"" to check what IP Fortnite was directing me to, and got this: https://imgur.com/a56zATs (35.198.58.1 - Google Cloud as showed below).

Who Is 35.198.58.1: https://imgur.com/tboafjZ.

Then I proceed to trace my ping to this IP, and got the expected result, a high latency between my provider (VIVO Fibra - 100mbps optical fiber) and Google Cloud: https://imgur.com/7cRRWnY.

Second, I entered a good ping game (5ms) and did the same thing, and the results are: 

1. Low ping is 18.231.114.211 - https://imgur.com/yluDhRE;

2. This IP redirects me to Amazon Cloud - https://imgur.com/Yj5nWcg;

3. Tracert confirms the ping -  https://imgur.com/ubOELZA.


As result I proved myself that half of my games are lagged because we are experiencing a route problem or something like that when using VIVO Fibra (Very used in Brazil) and playing on Google Cloud Servers. 

I even tried a free temporary VPN and player with 15ms using the route My Router &gt; Amazon VPN &gt; Google Cloud Server.

I paid for the first two battle passes, but never got the end rewards due to work and other commitments. 
Now though this could be down to my own fault. I bought it knowing I would have a time limit, but I shouldn't have to put a game before my actual life to get a skin right? 

With the introduction of cosmetics for experience I think it would be a brilliant idea to allow people who have bought the battle passes to get the rewards they didn't get with experience. 
Now if you notice me senpai and read this, I'm sure there are a number of ways you could implement this so i won't bother you with my own thoughts on that. 
I just figured it would be great for the paying fans to get what they paid for but still through earning it. (I'm kicking myself I don't have the black knight for example) Having the choice to unlock him after 100k experience earned would be beautiful. 
If you wanted too you could also make it a small purchase, so £9.99 for a ""second chance pass"" or some other name you developers come up with which will be much better. Where you have the skins, emotes, dances, pickaxes and vBux in a small pass where you can keep track of what you missed and how much experience you need to get. 
I'm sure I missed something but I'm sure you get the idea of what I'm trying to get across. Thanks for spending time for reading and I hope this gets noticed. (I really want my black knight haha) ",FortNiteBR

It also tracks your kills and how good those players are by KD, win %, and number of games. Totally lag-free.

**Try it here: [blitz.gg/fortnite](http://blitz.gg/fortnite)**

&amp;nbsp;

Hey r/FortniteBR,

&amp;nbsp;

I'm with the team at [Blitz Esports](https://twitter.com/BlitzEsportsCOM) (some of you League, Overwatch, or CS:GO players may know us for our esports coverage and LoL companion app.) We've been playing a ton of Fortnite and started cranking nonstop the past few weeks on this fun project for you guys.

&amp;nbsp;


## **What does the Blitz Fortnite app do?**

The leaderboard is an app that's exactly what it sounds like: a live-updating list of the players who've scored the most kills in your game.  It also doubles as a kill tracker: once you get a kill, it instantly tells you who you've wasted and how good (or bad) they are.

##[Live GIF](https://imgur.com/a/cMeq97a)

##[Screenshot: Leaderboard](https://imgur.com/he0tnCP)

##[Screenshot: Kill Tracker](https://imgur.com/DqvEtS6)

##[Screenshot: Detecting Screen](https://imgur.com/tM1qUdI)

&amp;nbsp;

#**So how do you use it?**

We've made it so easy, even your squad fill teammates can use it. 

* Just download and install the app at [**blitz.gg/fortnite**](http://blitz.gg/fortnite) (only available for Windows right now, sorry Mac/console users). 
* Make sure you have Replay Recording enabled.
* Start a game and watch the magic happen!

The app will auto-detect your game and show you a kill leaderboard as people start slaying. When you get a kill or a knock, it'll instantly show you that player's stats. If you get killed, your killer's stats will show up too. ~~So you can feel better about yourself.~~

The best part? Because the app is powered by replays, it's totally lag-free and won't cause any FPS drops whatsoever. The app is best used if you have a 2nd monitor right now (or you can alt-tab if you're brave), but we're working on an overlay next! Just wanted to get it out ASAP so we can start getting feedback and improving it.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for checking us out. The app is fresh off the stove, so please do let us know what you think or any feedback you might have. We're super pumped to show this, but it is a very early version, so there's tons of cool stuff to be added.

We'll be on this post all day to take questions, feedback and suggestions, and you can keep in touch with us via [Discord](http://blitz.gg/discord) afterward.",FortNiteBR

I thought that if i kept playing and practicing (in playground when it came out, by shooting sign post and building fast for example) i would get better. But i am not exaggerating at all when i say ive barely improved at all. i haven't won a single round and the most kills i get in a round is 1, 2 if im lucky. Im not even mad about it, just really confused and worried that i just wasted 4 months of my life. I can survive for as long as i want by just avoiding people or building away, but i tend not to do that since thats pointless, as it doesnt matter how long i survive if im always killed when im forced to encounter someone. The only reason why im still playing is because i spent money on the battle pass and i find it fun getting new skins (luckily you dont have to actually be good to level up, just by sinking sheer time into the game ive gotten to rank 55).

And stated that I also got a second Samsung Note 9 because AT&amp;T has a deal going on, if you pay for one Note 9, you get a second one for free..
    --Ok first thing I wanna clear up. YES i have another Note 9...NO I will not log into your account from it and give u 15,000 Vbucks and the Galaxy skin. 
    --Second thing, I don't know who said that you can just log into other people's accounts and they will have the Galaxy Skin. THIS IS NOT TRUE! I've tried.. I logged into both of my nephews accounts and it did not work. 

--Ok so I'll explain how the whole Galaxy Skin thing works. When you purchase the Note 9 (idk about the Tab S4) you will have 3 choices of what special offers you can redeem, you can pick to redeem the Galaxy Skin and 15,000 vbucks, you can pick to redeem to get a pair or 300$ AKG headphones, or you can pick to get the Galaxy Skin, 15,000 vbucks and the AKG headphones, but you have to pay 99$ So first u have to download the ""Shop Samsung"" app on your Note 9, Log into the app, then go to your ""My Offers"" tab. Choose which offer u want to redeem out of the 3 choices. Once u pick. (I picked the Galaxy skin and the 15,000 vbucks) you then click redeem, then link your epic account, to the Shop Samsung app and your offer will be redeemed. It takes up to 24 hours for the Galaxy skin and 15,000 Vbucks to actually show up in your fortnite account. That is how it works is the USA. Some one said on my other post that in New Zealand I believe all you have to do is play fortnite from the Note 9... (Which I don't know how true that is because I'm from the good ol' USA) I mean think about it.. if you could just log into others accounts and give them the skin and vbucks then everyone would have the skin and the vbucks for free. They made it a package attached to a 1,000$ phone for a reason. 

Sooooo the TL;DR is... NO I wont log into your epic account and give u a skin for FREE that I pretty much played $1,000 For. NO you cant just log into someone else's account and put the galaxy skin on there account. It is a ONE TIME redeemable package.

When people started to spray at me with smgs I didn’t mind at the beginning because I barely got killed by them but now I’m lucky if I even get a build fight without them spraying the building down. Some kid sprayed me with his smg to knock me down then used his shotgun to eliminate me. That makes no sense. Epic needs to buff shotguns again because they’re basically useless in this game now ,FortNiteBR

Haven't played in the last week or so and when I got on I noticed my skin was the new Musha skin, as well as the rest of my ""locker"" was rearranged to different things as well. I thought it was weird as no one but me has access to my ps4, but I wasn't gonna question a free skin... I decided to switch back to my Archetype skin only to find that it's not in my inventory. Has anyone experienced this? I'm thinking epic removed it for some reason and compensated with another cool skin.


TL;DR
Musha skin appeared in my locker and archetype disappeared. Only I have access to my ps4. Any ideas on what happened? ",FortNiteBR

Surely most of you know, but I'm here to tell you my experience after these past games that I've played, both solos and squads. 
Let me first show you the changes:

Wood wall initial HP increased from 80 to 90

Stone wall initial HP increased from 80 to 100

Metal wall initial HP increased from 80 to 110

Although this didn't bring back the wood wall HP to 100 like before, you can see it goes up with brick, metal being the strongest now. It surely makes sense, as metal was hardest to farm.
They also nerfed the Compact SMG and Tommy Gun, so there's that.

Background experience: After all these past weeks of playing the SMG Meta where you basically get no chance for using all of your building skills to beat the opponent, cause all you do is get sprayed and try to escape, with not much options. It was truly bad that you had to do next-level building in order to take down a guy who's blinding aiming towards you, and it got repetitive so quick that even the loyal players started to get bored pretty quickly.

And now, my feedback is the following: Fortunately for us, we got what we deserved. You know the feeling when you wanted to go into a buildfight and couldn't wait for it? Well, now it's actually happening. I love the fact that I can build and now get into intense fights, with many skilled opponents who feel the same thing I do. It's even better as you need to watch out your material count, and use metal only when important. People obviously didn't fully addapt, as I still see 500 wood and 50 metal after fights, where the guy only used wood. So yeah, the future is bright for the Meta yet again and I feel glad for this.

Also, sorry for the typing but I'm outside using a phone.",FortNiteBR

On top of that, there has been many laggy issues where the game spikes for some unknown reason. This is only happening in fortnite so it has nothing to do with my Internet.
Its making the game literally unplayable and I'd like to hear some response or solution about this because there has been quite a bit of people posting about the same issue in the fortnite forums and getting absolutely no help from that.


Might I also suggest that the fortnite developers stop releasing new guns every week or two to let gamers adjust to the new release and meta. I've only been able to use the guided missile once since it's release and now, theres a new gun which I'd have to try out. It would be really helpful if problems and bugs were solved before a new update gets released. As the game is right now, every update has been causing a lot of issues and some of them just get ignored and steamrolled over because of the next patch(which would come with its own set of issues).

Overall, please consider fixing bugs every now and then before releasing new updates. Thanks. ",FortNiteBR

The meteors were a nice addition because it meant you had to not only worry about players but the environment as well.

The rocket launch was also unique because it essentially a visible live update to the game in the form of an environmental changing event. It was really cool to just have that happening while in the middle of a match. 

I think it would be really cool if we had these kind of things more often. 

Like maybe there could be mountains or buildings (Tilted Towers) temporarily destroyed during a match. Maybe there could be weather changes that incorporate rain/snow/fog/etc. Maybe there could be NPC characters/enemies that spawn. 

The possibilities are limitless here. Anyone else feel the same? ",FortNiteBR

For example, let's say I have 3 mini potions, 3 bandages, and some remote explosives. If I eliminate someone and they happen to drop each of those items, I think being able to simply walk over them like you would with ammo would be better than having to pick them up like you're picking up a weapon. You would still have to do the initial pickup manually first to get the item into your inventory, but then after that it would automatically stack into your inventory the next time you walked over that item. I think this would make picking up items after you kill someone much easier, particularly in situations where you're trying to avoid the storm and when you're in crowded situations like the 50v50 game type.",FortNiteBR

Let's be honest here.  The pump sucks in it's current state.  I feel like it should be brought back to the way it was before.  I mean the entire reason the pump was nerfed was because of double pump (which I also think should be brought back but I don't see that happening any time soon.  If anything, AT LEAST change the headshot multiplier on ALL shotguns back to 2.5x.  If I hit a perfect headshot on someone with a blue pump, it should always be a one shot kill.  That's what is supposed to make up for it's slow fire rate.  

\-Revert back the materials nerf

Building is also going to shit now.  If someone starts spraying me I should be able to build a wall and a ramp and get a shot or two back at them, I shouldn't just be forced to stand there and spam wall because every time I build it it gets torn down in .2 seconds.  Wood SHOULD be more viable in quick combat.  Brick should be used when you know you'll have a few seconds before the enemy starts shooting at you, and metal should be almost always for fortifications.

\-Bring back the pump+tac combo

I don't really understand why they added a delay between ALL shotguns.  Pump+tac was never overpowered, and nobody ever really complained about it.  It should be a viable play style when all we have right now is just pump+spray or someone just running around with like 2-3 smgs or drum guns.  There's no variety anymore and it's getting really boring.  ",FortNiteBR

I understand, but it doesn't make me any less sad to see my problem ignored once again.**

Invisible players.

Traps not doing damage/not activating. 

Bounce pads not activating. 

Black visual glitches in the sky and on the ground.

When fortnite came out one of the reasons it was so popular is because it was fun, different and a silly game to mess around in. At the time COD and GTA were the powerhouses and fortnite offered a break from that. Nowadays the game is getting stale and the meta is not improving playing experience. I have seen many people quit and I feel like doing  the same now. The meta is unrewarding as a good player with 10 kills out of tilted can die to a noob that just holds down drum gun and lets aim assit go wild. Its no fun anymore. Ive been playing scince the beginning and I can say with certainty that season 2 was the most fun. I am not trying to be like the tons of people complaining about the meta in this sub but the game has been feeling less fun. Less emphasis on playing and more on just camping in towers. It seems like 90 perecent of lobies are filled with bots just because people are camping in towers and if a good player rushes them they pull out a p90 or rpg and the good player goes splat. Now this doesnt alwase happen but it happens enough for it to be a problem. Now the bad player thinks he is ""good"" because he got his first kill and the 15 kill player is discpuraged because he lost all his work for something out of his reach. Even if he double wall floor and ramped he would have gotten shot down by one splode. Not to mention how stale and boring mid game is. (I know this is hard to controle because of the density of places like tilted but I still wanted to mention it) . This is not to mention that they keep adding new items instead of fixing the game itself. Now im not here complaining and telling epic what to do but it feels like if they looked at double shotgun and other things such as directional sound before they added drum/p90 the game might have been more fun to play. Once again i am not complaining about epic in any way, shape, or form just offering my 2 cents on the state of the game at the moment. (Btw I consider myself a die hard at this game and I feel like i am pretty good as I can consistently get 6-12 kills a game and have nearly 40 solos so i consider myself able to give such an opinion) 

Tl;dr the game is getting boring and them adding new unviable weapons instead of fixing the core game is really making the game boring and unrewarding to play. ",FortNiteBR

If you look to an old classic free to play shooter Valve released over 10 years ago, Team Fortress 2 (TF2) and think about what feels most satisfying about the game, most would say getting a kill.

What about getting kills in a 10 year old game is SO MUCH more AMAZING to get than a kill in Fortnite. For this we need to turn to the sound design. I know that hitboxes, bullet spread, and DPS has a lot to do with it but Fortnite has all this down pretty well. When you get a kill in TF2 you either completely hit and do massive damage or you miss entirely to no damage at all. This is why the Pump Shotgun works well here. In TF2 and Fortnite hitting these THICK meatshots up close results in massive damage and most importantly a VERY satisfying LOUD and CRUNCHY low pitch sound that indicates that you just owned somebody. Not only that but there's a hitsound that plays when hitting a target regardless of damage. It's pitch is lower with higher damage and higher with low damage but not drastically. The default hitsound is very high pitched to mix well with the very low pitch sound of a bullet hitting or an explosive exploding on a target.

In TF2 most every available character (class) has a primary or optional primary that shoots in the same sort of way. One bullet HIT or disappointingly miss. All weapons that spray deal weak damage and are far less effective unless you in a situation where you have no option but to use it.

In Fortnite dealing damage with SMG's, AR's, or pistols results in (in my personal opinion) too high damage for such a high fire rate. But more importantly the way the gun itself works is unsatisfying to use without unloading a whole clip without missing any bullets because the hitmarker sound is very quiet and is an unusually midrange pitch for dealing damage.

You've probably seen these videos with this guy, ImDopeLoc creating ""modded"" servers for money. Essentially it's an empty server so as soon as the game starts, you get win. He claims that it doesn't violate the TOS and EPIC is fixing it next update but here's the thing:

The way this works is he's essentially DDOSing the server. Using an IP Puller he grabs the IP of the lobby.

Next he deploys a botnet which essentially crashes the server.

Now everyone on the server is frozen, most leave except for afk.

After 5 minutes or so, you have yourself an empty lobby after everyone leaves.

Now my though. There's no way this guy's claims of ""not violating the TOS"" is legit. His videos have been out for a couple of weeks now, and I see no reason why he has not been banned yet. There's videos of this occurring with over 2 million views. I guess most people don't realize he's DDoSing the servers but this guy should really be banned.

**TLDR:** Guy names ImDopeLoc getting $20 per person to create modded lobbies, which he doesn't tell people is actually deploying a botnet on the server and claiming it doesn't violate the TOS. Should be banned immediately.",FortNiteBR

But I was thinking that it could be some kind of tier system. Obviously not everyone would be able to obtain rewards all rewards, but that's what would make it special because it would be a way to see how long players have played and how much work they've put into their levels. A fine example of potential skins. 

Only the highest leveled players would be able to obtain the best rewards, and since our Account Level will rise each season, players will have the opportunity to obtain the higher tier rewards in later seasons, while still allowing the highest level of players to obtain rewards first.

Example: 
Current max level is 370 (Please correct me if wrong)
Only players at level 370 would be able to obtain rewards for that tier. 
Tier scaling is up to Epic but there could be rewards every 10-25 levels

Now, I've bought a handful of items from the shop before without really ever paying attention to the ""Featured Items"" section. I mainly look for items that I really like and (more importantly) are well priced.

With the Burger skin releasing just 2-3 hours ago, this was the first skin I 100% wanted to buy. It wasn't until I got into the shop that I was blown away by the price. The skin itself was $15 (1500 V-Bucks) and the full set was a total of $32 (3200 V-Bucks). IMO, this is pretty ridiculous for what is essentially fancy pixels.

I don't understand how people (especially kids) are able to (and are willing to) just buy these expensive items on a near-daily basis.",FortNiteBR

The thing is, why do people care about rarity? If you have problems with people running with your skin then it is your problem. While yes, some people do judge player's skill level depending on how rare their skin is, skins were made for people to enjoy them in the first place. 

Now that we got my rant out of the way, I think it would be somewhat of a decent idea for battle pass skins to be available for purchase in store a few seasons later. What I mean is, people who have purchased battle pass (950 vbucks) and reached level 100, will unlock the skin and have it before anyone else does. However, that same skin will be available for purchase (for 2000 Vbucks) 1 or 2 seasons later. What this will do is, it will give players who have joined Fortnite later a chance to purchase the skin they want. After all, we are one community and we need to look after each other.

You can fix this by changing your skin to something else by using a mobile/console version of Fortnite.

I bought the Beef Boss skin today, and it was great for a couple games, but after two games, I tried to quit to the lobby, but the game crashed as the lobby opened.  When I reopened Fortnite, and tried to reopen battle royale, I was met with another crash.  I tried this again and crashed.  I then verified Fortnite, and it still crashed.  I reinstalled Fortnite and it still crashed.  

I then checked the subreddit and from what I've seen, a few people have posted about this, and it as all happened in the past hour or so, which is when the shop reset and when Beef Boss was released.  Someone in a comment section mentioned that it could be Beef Boss, so I went on mobile and changed my skin, and tried to reopen Fortnite, and it opened perfectly fine with no crash.  My friends have bought the skin and played with it on console (xbone and switch specifically) and they have not experienced any crashes even after multiple games played.  Mobile is safe as I could play on it and change my skin without any crashes, so it seems to be a pc specific issue.

Not sure what is causing this, I don't know how to read log files and crash reports and stuff like that, but all I can say is just be cautious if you use this skin on pc, if you have no other way to play Fortnite at all.",FortNiteBR

You shouldn't have to farm materials for 15 minutes for a build battle. Without building this game would be absolutely trash. Materials should be quicker to farm than what they are now. 

My suggestion is to make 10 harvesting damage equal to 1 material piece. A big tree would give 60 wood, a big stack of pellets would give 30 wood, a big pile of rocks would give 45 stone, a container would give 100 metal. You get my point. It would bring simplicity to the whole harvesting system. It's so weird and inconsistent at the moment. 

A simple buff that could bring ""balance"" to the building aspect of the game, or not. I don't know how it would play out in actual matches but building should be the biggest part of this game, it shouldn't take a lot of effort to be able to build. Build battles are what makes this game fun.

I'm also not trying to sound like an attention-seeker, but I have anxiety so yeah I'm overreacting to this and I'm very worried. This is the last time I'll make this post, and I'll try to explain my situation as best as I can.

It is stated that going AFK is against the code of conduct for Fortnite's Battle Royale.

1. **Play fairly and within the rules of the game**. Don’t cheat, AFK, grief, exploit bugs or glitches, team up in groups larger than the game mode allows (e.g. in solo matches do not work with other players, respectfully eliminate them instead) or impersonate others.

I'll make this story short. I was playing 50vs50 mode, had to go AFK for 10 minutes, then I came back and resumed playing. A few hours later, I read the Code of Conduct since I've never read it before. I saw that going AFK was against the code of conduct. I have anxiety, so I became very worried about being banned. I did something very stupid next, please don't make fun of me for this, lol, but I contacted customer support and asked if I should expect a ban for this, and told them the full story. Week later, no response, so for some reason I e-mailed them again, no response. I'm very anxious that they're just gonna read my e-mail, say ""You went AFK? Permanent ban!"" Yeah, I know, It was probably very dumb to email them just because I went AFK ONE round.

So basically, I just wanna know this.

If support does ever read my e-mail, will they just permanently ban me, or will it just be a warning?

Some people say not to worry because going AFK is not bannable, but it's in the code of conduct, so I'm very confused.

TL;DR

I have a few questions.

1. Is going AFK in Battle Royale bannable, if not, why is it in the code of conduct?
2. If I was stupid, and emailed customer support admitting I went AFK and they read my email, will they ban me without any warning, or will they just give me one warning since I only went AFK one time?
3. Is it possible to close a support ticket?",FortNiteBR

I have been playing fortnite since october, and part of the reddit since about march. There are a lot of great things about this place, from the memes, to the awesome clips. Plus It's always nice to  know all the changes, especially the undocumented ones. I also know that this sub has done a lot of good for the game, they have given many suggestions which really improved the game, helping to drive it forward.

Before I started visiting reddit I was very happy with the game. I tended to focus on the good parts of the game, ignoring the issues. Of course it's not good that there are issues in a game, in a perfect world there wouldn't be. But there's no reason that I should dwell on them, after all I am not a developer of the game, so why should i worry about the things wrong with the game?  


However, because of this sub I have begun to actually dislike fortnite. Now part of the reason is the shift in meta which i am not a huge fan of, but a larger part is that I have begun to focus on all the problems with the game. I find that I am ignoring the good changes they make, and choosing to dwell on the ones I do not like.  If they ever fix something that has been a problem for some time I always have the mindset of ""Well it's about time"". I'm not really grateful for all the good changes they have made. Like much of the sub I am impatiently waiting for an instant edit button on console, separate building sensitivities, material gathering buffs which are never going to come, and many other changes or fixes in the game.  


I am by no means saying that the is sub should not exist, or that other people should leave with me, but I see no reason why I should spend my time around here. Thanks for all the good you guys have done, catch you on the flip side.  


TL;DR- I am bitter about the direction and problems with this game, this sub is only making it worse. But thank you to the people of this sub that have improved this game.",FortNiteBR

For the past month I’ve been using the J key to shoot and I to aim. The building keys are fine but my real problem is shooting controls. This way it gets really hard to aim using my thumb (I use WASD btw). I’m thinking of changing to using right click for aim and left click for shooting but then how do I aim while shooting? Any help on shooting bindings will be great. Thanks in advance.",FortNiteBR

I miss the old Fortnite, less meta gold Fortnite,

original bold Fortnite, less nood more pro Fortnite.

I hate the new Fortnite, mats overdue Fortnite,

AR's can't shoot Fortnite, this misconstrued Fortnite.

I miss the sweet Fortnite, build and repeat Fortnite,

It's looking like, shotguns have gone obsolete Fortnite,

Epic invented Fortnite, not kids on forums Fornite,

yet I look and look around, so many changes despite,

the ones who loved Fortnite, played what it was Fortnite,

we earned our dubs Fortnite, cleaned up the scrubs Fortnite,

now we are divided Crips and Bloods Fortnite.

You taking hate Fortnite, start to frustrate Fortnite,

you take the bait, when all these noobs complain Fortnite,

now go don't wait Fornite, go change your fate Fortnite,

all we ask is more balance in each update Fortnite,

I miss the smart Fortnite, straight from the heart Fortnite,

That work of art Fortnite, pre-shopping cart Fortnite,

The satisfying play, die, then restart Fortnite.

I miss the old Fortnite

So the answer is simple. I noticed that the Fortnite in initially was more skill based game than the present Fortnite. 
And why? I noticed this when my friend came over, and bring PS4 with himself.
So I never played with console before and i tryed out. I started play Fortnite with console, and i cant hold the crosshair on the target. Every time when i got gun fight i died fast, cuz i cant aim with controller. So i realized why epic makes the Fortnite lower skill cap. I was potato on PS, and i dont want to epic make the Fortnite more unskilled. I just want to a practice mode where i can learn how the aim assisst and the others work.

Because the new meta puts let’s emphasis on out maneuvering your opponent and more on just barrel stuffing through builds. 

Why is this important? It hurts epic’s marketing. When you have streamers saying “I want to quit” or “the game is terrible right now”, all those little kids are going to listen to them and jump ship.

You shoot a sniper, and immediately switch weapons to an assault rifle and fire immediately...

With this tactic headshots with the sniper dont even matter, as long as the shot hits you are almost always guaranteed an instant kill, and if not the enemy is very low and has no advantage...

Even the hunting rifle becomes an insta-kill weapon...

And this isn't hard to pull off, all it takes is a decent aim with snipers and a lack of self value...

**PLEASE** stop constantly complaining about the current meta, building, and materials. 

**PLEASE** stop saying “Epic is catering to noobs”, double pump should be brought back, and that “Fortnite is dying”.

Let me personally address some of these complaints to make a quality feedback post for people to read.

* **The current (SMG) meta is bad**

The current SMG meta may be pretty controversial, but everyone and their mom knows about this. The “spray and pray” meta is rough to counter, trust me, but people don’t realize that the counter to this is just to use metal walls. 

“What the fuck do you mean use metal walls?”

Metal walls have been seriously buffed the last couple of patches. 400 health to 500 health. Takes 5 seconds less to build. I understand wood has been nerfed, but people have yet to realize that maybe for a change we need to start using metal to our advantage. Rather than constantly pushing people, maybe we should stay in bases. The hard counter to SMGs is long range combat; stay in a metal 1v1, laser anyone nearby. Hell, use a sniper!

(I understand people don’t like camping, but if you hate the SMG meta so badly, why don’t you try it out for a change?)

* **Building has been ruined / EPIC is catering to new players**

Building certainly hasn’t been ruined, and if you believe that then you should immediately stop putting bullshit posts on this subreddit and actually play the game. Just because someone sprays you with a SMG a couple of times doesn’t mean “building is useless”. I’ve never had an issue with building whatsoever with the recent patches, having -20% less health does NOTHING. That’s literally **ONE** less AR bullet to a structure and its destroyed.

I constantly see people building to this day. EPIC is certainly not catering to casuals, they’re just making it easier for newer players to stand a chance against you. If you’ve been killed by a newer player (if they appear to be one) within the past couple of patches, that is completely your fault.

* **It’s impossible to get a ton of materials now**

If you are complaining about materials being tougher to get, thats not really true. They did nerf the rate at which you get materials now, but its pretty easy to get them still? Let me highlight a few places for you to get a lot of materials at. Mostly wood, though.

* Tilted Towers: has a ton of pallets and cars. Expect 600+ wood and 400+ metal from here if you actually farm.
* Wailing Woods: has enough trees to get you to max wood, and has outlying rocks for you to destroy. Expect 999+ wood and 600+ stone here.
* Dusty Divot: has enough trees/pallets to get you to max wood, has some metal structures for you to destroy. Expect 999+ wood and 200+ metal from here.
* Literally every other location on the map: look around for trees, rocks, and cars, and you’ll be sure to get at least 400+ of each material at any location.. sheesh.

* **Double pump should be brought back / double pump was better than the current meta in retrospect**

Double pump was an exploit to shoot as fast as a tactical shotgun for 30+ damage (+ it used to one shot you if headshotted). Double pump required zero skill to do, and if you say it did, please kindly shut the fuck up. I am getting tired of these numerous comments on Youtube, twitter, instagram -even here- saying it should he brought back. Thinking you’re good at the game because you can quickly switch between two guns is horrible. People now whine that the pump is useless. Well kiddo, let me tell you this- land your shots by aiming, not by spamming two weapons to get 180+ damage in under 2 seconds.m

* **Fortnite is dying**

It is certainly NOT. Its actually probably at its peak right now (source: viewers on twitch, amount of youtube videos being produced, Google Trends)! Just because EPIC is making a few changes to the game doesn’t mean people are being driven away from it. Fortnite for me, and for millions of others, is fun. The only time it truly wasn’t fun for me was when I had to grind to max omega. They fortunately removed that grinding aspect to the game. If you’re getting bored of Fortnite, be my guest and try PvE, or StW. A fun game if you actually put effort into it, not just farming vbucks because you’re a scum.

If you downvote this, at least provide a comment to tell me why you downvoted me. If you upvote this, also please tell me why. I want open discussion here. A good reason would be appreciated.",FortNiteBR

S5 lore is lacking big time.,"One of my favorite things about Fortnite since Season 3 has been the way that map updates told the story of the Fortnite universe. Epic did a great job with the lore leading up to season 5 (and season 4 for that matter) with all the map changes leading to the rocket launch and subsequent crack in the sky and rifts. It really seemed like their goal was to create a much more dynamic map with interesting subtle changes that worked like puzzle pieces to tell a story or tease more major upcoming changes every week. I also loved how cryptic the changes could be, and how they almost always were up for interpretation from the player, and every week spawned new theories about what was going to happen and what everything meant. I was looking forward to every update to see what would happen next to push the story along. Now it seems like everything has just stopped dead in its tracks. Map updates have been so subtle that I've barely even realized the changes (we had some trucks move around Dusty?) We have all these new locations this season but there doesn't seem to be any attempt at a story arc to explain them. There are Moai all over the map, elements of Norse mythology, and wild west themes, but there doesn't seem to be any attempt to explain why. The loading screens from last season actually seemed to piece together a story from one week to the next leading up to The Visitor's escape in the rocket.. This season it just seems to be Drift and Brite Bomber hanging out and doin hoodrat shit. I know it's still relatively early in the season, and maybe we're just spoiled by how awesome this game has been in the past, but I'm really hoping that Epic doesn't let the story take a back seat to their focus on new cosmetics, weapons and heavyhanded experimental game mechanic tweaks.    


Also... where the eff is Tomatohead?  


TL;DR...   
Still waiting on more ""Worlds to collide""

Not trying to put any beef on the skillet here, but I have both an Xbox and PS and feel I always play better on the PS. My Xbox friend insists it's because the competition level is notably higher on the Xbox but that's always seemed far fetched to me.

Putting PC aside for a moment (I realize that's far and away the most competitive gaming environment), does anyone else play even semi-regularly on both and have an opinion? 

I think the population of gamers is too large on both consoles for either to boast a more talented player base, but I'm curious if folks here have an opinion based on their personal experience.

Really sad that Epic is STILL experimenting with their game..... I thought this game would be good to play competitively but Epic messed that up as well.


This isn’t just salty tears, but more of me being upset that Epic still hasn’t gotten their shit together. This balance update is a start, at least.

Since this subreddit mainly contains toxic players who are, or too lazy to adapt to the new meta, or just not able to and thus complain on this subreddit, so I'd really like to highlight Epic's attention for the community. For most of the updates, Epic always listened to the feedback the playerbase gave, and is proven true again with the recent building buff.

While I've never seen a game developer really care about it's playerbase, Epic does and hopefully keeps doing in the future. This is what made PUBG and H1Z1 die, ignoring the community. This is what keeps Fortnite fun and alive; variation.

Simply, just try to adapt to the new meta, just like many people did to the double pump meta. Some haven't even tried to adapt and just come complaining here. Bad players complain about new metas, mediocre players are able to adapt.

*A message for Epic developers: please keep listening to the playerbase. It's what keeps this fun game alive. We care, too!*

Sincerely, 

An end S2 player

 i just want you to answer me sir why they don't do a level matchmaking , so new players """" level 0-29 """" gonna match with new players , eeh players  level 25-50 play againts them selfs , and the tryhards go in againt each other , isn't that gonna fix the new players  problmes without messing with the gameplay and buildings ? 

i'll be reading all of the comment that have a strong point to tell , thanks you ♥",FortNiteBR

When a match reaches late game it's very easy to have accumulated max small ammo weather it would be from kills or looting, this essentially makes the minigun have the largest magazine size (999 at max). I think everyone can agree that it is extremely oppressive to play against in squads, especially when there is 3 miniguns raining down fire on you, but it's there to serve a purpose and it's purpose is to tear down structures, it just accomplishes that task a little too well. 

I think a couple of solutions could work for this gun, for example making it into a sort of machine gun; 250 bullets per clip and a long reload time (Character would have to unload ammo box, replace it with a new one and feed the belt) or make it overheat after a certain amount time/bullets fired (barrels would heat up and eventually start smoking, you would have to wait for them to cool down before using again).

I'm not flaming the minigun or Epic because I believe this gun has a place in the game, I'm merely trying to have a discussion with you guys to see what everyone's thoughts are about its current state. Any suggestions and discussions are welcome!

TL;DR :
The minigun should have a cool down period so you would not be able to fire 999 bullets continuously.",FortNiteBR

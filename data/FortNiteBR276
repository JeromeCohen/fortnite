Instead of putting it into the game, cut and dry, they should add it as an LTM OR run it similar to the Shooting Test. Obviously, it wouldn't be called that: something along the lines of Building Test 1 would be better.

Regardless, just an idea. What do ya'll think? ",FortNiteBR

We are expecting tons of new content, news, and videos from Epic. With that, we are expecting tons of spam and hype. The sub will implode. Due to the nature of this update, we will be making some drastic changes for tomorrow. 

##**This is being done as a trial run.**

Once downtime begins around 3:45 - 4:00am EST - the sub will be entering restricted mode. Only Epic Employees and Moderators will be able to submit posts. You will still be able to comment.

##**Why?**

Normally, with each patch downtime, people already spam when is it coming up, where are patch notes, etc. We are anticipating this to be exponentially increased with this patch.

##**We are expecting many of you to not be happy with this, as restricting posts lessens the hype.** However, everyone knows the subreddit gets absolutely slammed, and with the new season beginning, we are expecting a slew of repeated low effort season 5 hype threads, along with repeated posts of any news updates.

--------

Patch Notes will be posted and stickied on the front page. Any news articles and relevant information will be posted either by Epic or a moderator. 

**Once downtime ends, restricted mode will be TURNED OFF approximately 20-25 minutes after the servers are back up. At this time, people can freely post again.**

There will be our normal patch index megathread where we will continue to consolidate all the popular news, threads, and hot topics (such as datamined skins).

##**To confirm, this is being done on a trial run**

***If the servers do go down again, we will be re-enabling restricted mode***",FortNiteBR

Maybe i'm just expecting too much out of the Battle Pass, since not every skin is gonna be a hit.

This is a list of what Epic should change in season 5.  THIS IS ALL MY OPINIONS AND YOU ARE FREE TO DISAGREE.

\-First off all, its called ""WEEKLY challenges"" and should be way harder than what is was in season 4, every week only took 1-2 hours to complete, and most of the challenges was so boring, ---&gt; Search chest @location, etc. 

\-----

\-Tier 100 was WAY too easy to get, ""Omega"" the most superior and final skin of season 4 battle pass, it's supposed to be the higest tier skin, that shows power. I remember Season 2 &amp; 3 when you would be scared to see a Black Knight or a John Wick. Now 90&amp;#37; of omegas are complete bots who barely knows how to play. 

As a good player and I know other good player who grind the game  obviously want something exlusive for the real grinders. So if Epic doesn't want the tier 100 skin to be exlusive then I hope they atleast add another skin that only few people have.

ALL THIS IS MY OPINION ABOUT 2 SMALL THINGS EPIC SHOULD CHANGE, DONT HATE ON ME FOR SHARING MY THOUGHTS. ty &lt;3",FortNiteBR

I have been told on reddit that Fortnite is the only game for Switch that currently supports voice chat. 

Now I have tried three different methods of using a mic on Fortnite and have thus far been unable to chat on Fortnite.  

I bought a very cheap Afterglow headset that said it was made for the Switch. It uses a 3.5 mm cable to plug into the top of the Switch. Head phone ear piece works, mic does not. 

I bought Logitech headset that plugs into USB and plugged it into the USB port on the charging dock. Neither mic nor head phones work.

I dug out a mini soundboard and plugged a Shure vocal mic into it, adapted a 3.5 mm audio out and plugged it into the 3.5 jack on the Switch with a splitter for earbuds. This time I could hear both game audio in my buds and my voice coming through the mic, but my speaker icon on Fortnite was not showing any sound.

On the main screen it says Global Chat Unavailable. 

Anybody got any tips?

Total gain is 50. It takes 2 seconds to drink (should not be changed), the same as a small shield potion.

But here's the thing. Small shield potions are the uncommon green rarity. Shield potions/Half shields or whatever are the blue rare rarity. Slurp juice is the same effect shield wise as a small shield potion, but it's epic rarity and takes 13.5x longer for the same effect.. All for getting an extra 25 health on top of the shield. People will sometimes carry a small shield potion rather than slurp juice to battle because **it's literally 13 and a half times faster**. And this thing is epic rarity? What are some actually good uses for this item, other than giving you 25 seconds of storm immunity in the early game?

How I would rebalance the slurp juice is have it give 40 health and shield total, 2 each every second for a total of 20 seconds, and still taking 2 seconds to drink it. Currently, the slurp juice takes **25 seconds** to absorb its full effect. This way it would only take 20.

And finally, if you die in duo/squad/50v50, if you get revived you can use two bandages and a slurp juice to get up to full health and +40 shield. That sounds more like an epic rarity.

Or epic games can keep the slurp juice rather underpowered, but change its rarity to Rare (blue) instead of making it the epic purple one so that the item fits its rarity better, and make it a bit more abundant.",FortNiteBR

Not everyone has time to play the game 24/7. We have work school family etc. Tier up is easy than level up. What do you guys think of this ?

With the recent changes to how the SMGs work, I feel as if they are far too powerful within the Fortnite world. A lot of the killfeed messages I see now are people dying to SMGs, and, on some occasions, from distances that are 50 metres or longer. I understand that you wanted to make them fulfill a special role with double shotgun staying in and the Dual Pistols being introduced, but I fear that this is a bit much. The Suppressed SMG can melt people from miles away now thanks to its longer range, decent damage, and absurdly tight accuracy. Why would I ever use a grey/green/blue AR when a SSMG is going to outperform it at everything except long range plinking? The recent changes to these guns also make the semi-automatic pistols absolutely obsolete - the SMGs are way better for anti-personnel and anti-material at any range except long; at which you shouldn't be using either type of weapon anyway. There is no point in using a Silenced Pistol when the SSMG is a thing. Also, the purple Tactical SMG absolutely rips people apart at close-range if you can aim adequately. 40 damage headshots? I can get behind the tighter hip spread, but... that's just absurd.

My suggestions:

Suppressed SMG

* Revert damage from 22/23/24 to 20/21/22
* Slightly decrease the accuracy (I feel as if it still needs the accuracy bonus to compete with the other SMGs)

Tactical SMG

* Revert the damage (18/19/20 &gt; 16/17/18)
* Slightly decrease accuracy and add more recoil

Drum Gun

* Keep the damage the same (it drops off quickly, so I feel as if it's fine)
* Add slightly more recoil

Shotgun equip time

* Revert slowed equip time for these weapons
* When rapidly switching from one weapon to another after having fired the first one 1s ago or shorter, have the player undergo an animation of them readying the shotgun. This will prevent a lot of scummy tactics such as double pumping, pump-taccing, etc.

That's pretty much all I have to say for now. I have ideas for the regular SMG if you decide to bring it back, but that's for another post. I just feel as if it's weird that we have a 'Tactical' and Suppressed SMG but no normal one.

Farewell for now.",FortNiteBR

1. llamas nerf reverted - There was no point in llamas being nerfed, llamas are so rare the loot in them should be very good instead of only 200 mats. oh yeah and ""I CAN EXPLAIN""

2. Pump nerf reverted - The amount of times i've done 4 - 10 damage with a BLUE pump is insane like please epic no one asked for the nerf and pumps are so ineffective now.

\- That's it honestly the game is doing great but there's a slight issue that i really want to touch on that can be prevented if we fight this. Epic has recently came out with a blog post thats called ""COUNTERPLAY AND PLAY STYLES"" in this specific post epic stated ""We are exploring changes to weapon balance and resource economy, like e.g. resource caps"" know i understand that they want to help newer players but they have got to understand that building and the materials economy is perfect right now, if they choose to do said nerfs this game can suffer very badly in very negative ways. Let's please fight this decision that epic has maid about nerfing materials.

(WARNING EXCESSIVE CUSSING)

\- I'm going to state my honest opinion about the nerf and a very immature way but i need to get this off my chest 

\- Epic, this nerf is going to fuck up the game more than you think it is, i have no fucking clue what is going threw your mind. Making a blog post talking about materials being capped pissed 15 million players off, so why would you do such a thing to this community. The fucker who said ""Just build lol"" needs his or her fucking head caved in because building is what makes this game successful and fun.

If you bought the battle pass, you deserve to get full omega. In it's current state, the leveling system hurts solo players and rewards bush camping. What kind of game is epic trying to make? A skill-based shooter or bush camping simulator 2018? If you're trying to grind to max, you should be rewarded for getting kills. Kills PLURAL. Not just one kill giving you exp and the other not even counting. The current most effective way of leveling up is just being afk for a while. The main counter argument is that you don't want people to buy their tiers. So what? Why not?

There is this bizarre mindset about what the actual goal of the game is. If someone is able to camp and get top 10 every game, in my book they're pretty damn good at battle royale. Sure, maybe they're not good at killing, but they're good at *surviving,* which is the entire point of BR. Personally, I like to frag. That's my play style and it's what makes the game fun for me. Someone else might love playing the game stealthily trying to just survive as long as possible. If they consistently place higher than me, then they're better than I am at the game, and just use a different play style to get there. I'm genuinely interested in why people think that if you don't get a lot of kills then you're bad at Fortnite. If you are absolutely better than every camper, they should never place above you.  


Saying that not getting a lot of kills makes you bad is like saying Katniss was bad at the hunger games, and the people from districts 1 and 2 were the best because when the game started they fragged out.  


TL;DR: It doesn't matter how many kills you get, campers can also be very good at battle royale games, just have a different playstyle. Let campers do their thing, it doesn't make them bad at the game. That's just what's fun for them.",FortNiteBR

This went on for like 20 minutes and 3 different devices. Eventually i gave up and went to play a few games. I came back on Reddit and to my excitement my inbox had over 50 messages.



 So i check my account to see what was going on and to my horror, i see EVERY single post attempt went through while i was gone.
Almost all the messages was something along the lines of ""Enjoy the ban"", ""Cringe"" or ""STOP REPOSTING THIS"". And understandingly i was banned for 2 days.

Seriously that gun needs a major nerf, make it reload slower and reduce the explosive ratio.

Yes I am salty, lost two games in a row because someone just spams it and one if them hits always. Even before losing I know this gun is extremely overpowered end game.

King Richard tested it the other day after the buff and agreed that is really stupid that Epic made it deadlier.

It doesn't have any reason to be this long but I really started having fun describing the whole thing.

So these videos with kids screaming after their first win are totally legit. My son just started playing on Saturday and of course wants everything, I tell him maybe the battlepass for the new season and explain all that stuff. He still really wants something so I tell him about the umbrellas for winning, he's happy and hoping he can do it before the season changes. Didn't want me to just do it for him which is nice because he plays on a Switch and I can't play for shit on that any way. His reaction time isn't too quick and he can't predict anything since that just come with experience, he's been playing mostly 50v50 and dying about halfway through each game, just goofing around. Well last night he made it through one and his team won and he got so hyped, but apparently I didn't mention 50v50 wins don't count for umbrellas? Felt like such a dumbass, he's all sad and asking me to duo. We try a few game and get to the top 10 twice, can't finish the job. Bed time and I tell him  for tomorrow to do squads with fill and just try to help out his teammates. Follow them, build for them, look and shoot where they do.

So he's played some games and keeps thinking every game will be the one. Facetiming me at work to tell me how close he got and the other team must have cheated or something, lmao. Now I'm coming home for lunch and getting that together so I can't join in. He starts a new match again about when I'm done so now I get to watch, honestly it's a pretty great feeling to see him trying to actually play the right way and not just go off on his own or screw with people, seriously got the feels just seeing him smile so much and really get at it. Anywho one teammate fucks off to who knows where, dies bad right off the start. He followed the two others to risky reels. They seem ok, they build some walls and ramps for cover, nothing crazy, and have decent aim. Killed two people there and were trying to loot up, they are throwing shields and guns at each other to make sure they're maxed and good to go.

My son comes up and starts taking the loot they are obviously throwing right at each other. He doesn't really know about strategy and what they're doing and I'm dying inside thinking about these guys getting pissed and ditching him. I'm trying to explain to him what they're doing and how to emote wants/needs, he's drinking the shields and telling me he doesn't know how to throw stuff down. My god I'm about to lose it, I make him go to the options and read what button throws stuff so he can at least toss the green ar back down. The other guys actually stayed there the whole time and somehow seemed to figure out their third had no idea he was really doing. They chuck some grey stuff and clingers to him, he's trash talking the grey stuff and saying he'll just wait for real guns. I tell him to pick up that silenced smg and don't you dare look down it. He gets the green ar again too.

They're off and the teammates kill a few others passing Tomato Town, he's trying to shoot at them and build some walls so it's something. They get to the edge of containers. The other two guys see a squad and engage. My son decides to build a big two story fort cause ""they're invincible"", he gets about 6 pieces down and is trying to edit a door in before I get him to knock it off and help shoot cause his team is already doing that, the fight will be over before he's finished and they aren't going to run back to it any way. It's the exterior wall in the NE of containers and the other team is trying to push over or around. He runs over, selects clingers, and proceeds to stick a wall, a ramp, and a teammate, and keeps running. Clingers go off and it's bodies everywhere, he downed himself and *three* enemies. He's big talking like he meant to do that and I'm jumping out of my seat screaming and losing it. He gets revived and after more looting and item sharing they're off again. He's got a gold silenced pistol and a purple hand cannon because we're still working on what guns do and colors aren't the end all factor for picking stuff up. I think I've convinced him to stay with the auto weapons for now.

And he's got a freaking **3** for a kill count. I'm at least 1000% more excited than he is about it. There's 9 left and the circle is getting small. They're on the north side of Lonely and see some guys to the South. I'm yelling positions and back seat driving which is probably super annoying, I don't think he's listening anyway and just doing his thing. The two teammates are one wall and ramp style fighting, my son proceeds to put turbo build to the limit. He for sure put walls in front of them and screwed up some of their shots, but it's also protecting them pretty well. They're resigned to it and began just using ramps to shoot over his maze of wood. No one is building high and just using trees/rocks/one ramp to fight because Switch I guess. I'm not even keeping up with kill counts and total players left. The team they're fighting dies and there's more guys building at the camper parking lot west of Lonely, I think they were shooting at the team in the middle that just died. I am up at the TV shouting and pointing to guys now, thank god my wife had gone to the store and wasn't there to witness this. 

My son's team is trying to approach with the standard no cover except rocks or trees method. The other team had built metal **two** panels up and around a camper, holy shit they must be pros. Wood ramps go up one high and it's on, the two teammates seem to be picking their shots and being cautious. My son is a bit behind the other two, shooting and probably trying to get kills, but only managing to light up their metal two high palace. I'm off the deep end because he is exposing them big time and the other two just need to hit some shots. They do. Two enemies are trying to crawl behind the camper and my son's team rushes up. Just as my son gets up there to thirst everyone the middle of the screen changes, Victory Royale. Cue the videos of kids screaming, he lost his mind. We're both screaming and pointing and celebrating, never had this much fun ever. He remembers the umbrella and gets the control back to go see it, sits back down on the couch. He's smiling and laughing and telling me that is was so much fun that he peed his pants. 

He peed his pants. He's not caring and fixing it either. He just gave me that update while trying to get to the locker. I tell him are you serious, stand up then. He does so while still looking at the screen. Thinks the wet paint umbrella is great. Now that's he's seen it he starts walking to the bathroom and just talking the whole way about it. Nonchalantly takes everything off and laughs while telling me this is his Victory Royale underwear so maybe we shouldn't wash it. Throws it in the dirty clothes hamper and walks out. Goes back to couch and starts a new game while still naked. I don't even know what to think except I really wish I was a kid again. And thanks rando squad guys, you'll never know how happy you made an 8 year old.",FortNiteBR

To me, it should be when a person levels up enough levels that equal how much XP was needed to level up to 80 in season 4, they get the lights.

Let me explain.

Pretend someone ended season 4 at level 75. Each level to get to 80 required 10,000 XP. (I know the numbers are inaccurate but it's just an example) So if the first 5 levels in season 5 are 200 XP each, once you level up to level 5 you get the achievement of getting to level 76 in the Omega Challenge. Then it keeps going until say you reach level 25 in Season 5, then it counts as reaching level 80 in season 4 added up.

In my opinion the best thing to replace them with are sprint contrails and/or skin based sprint animations.

sprint trails (seen above) are now just a little fart when you start sprinting. Noone likes that. Much cooler would be some flames, bubbles, black feathers or even something entirely different.

Sprint animations (seen belove) could be unique for legendary skins, for example, instead of running, carbide could fly at normal running height, Rex could run like a dino, or another skin could sit in a cloud.

(CONSOLE)","The console aim assist needs a overhaul. There had been hundreds of threads about this matter yet with no response from Epic Games. 

The aim assist is so strong and sticky in this game that it hinders aiming. Especially with guns such as the Hunting Rifle and Drumgun. Whenever i'm aiming at a opponent, the crosshair will be very hard to move whenever it is above or right beside the player. The aim assist kicks in and I have to fight to move the crosshair an inch. This makes it especially nearly impossible to Hunting Rifle shoot a moving enemy.

Players have previously complained about the aim assist hindering them, so you gave the option to completely remove it. But this brings players at a huge disadvantage when fighting other players. 

Why dont you give us the option to adjust the aim assist like in most other shooting games? This would be a game changer and give us the option to play exactly the way we want to. 

I am talking about a slider which will give players the option to change the effectiveness of the aim assist from 0 - 10. (Zero being no aim assist and ten being the current one).

Either this or a complete rewamp of the aim assist IS NEEDED. It sucks not being able to play to your potential due to this issue.",FortNiteBR

For those not following, Tfue and Cloak have won 4 of the Friday Fortnite tournaments and are head and shoulders above the competition currently.

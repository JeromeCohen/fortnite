***HEY,*** so first of all to get you guys to know whats going on.

I am ***lilnixi*** and I tilted this guy into another atmosphere when he was already tilted to death.

If you don't know him this is **RazZzero0o**. He holds a **world record** for the highest solo winstreak (42 wins in a row) and has a **76\% winrate** right now (I believe hes Germany's best player). As I was playing random fill duos in the morning I (lilnixi - 40&amp;#37; winrate scuffed wannabe pro) met him and got to get highground on him in order to put him into a turtle box. You have to note that **he was already tilted** because he had a really bad day.\*\* As I killed him he got really\*\* mad and quit Fortnite to play Realm Royale (only for some days).

Now the main reason I think it should be a permanent mode is because of my nine year old little brother, he loves to play fortnite but he unfortunately doesn't have much friends to do duo or squads with so he can really only play by himself. Now this is where 50v50 is enjoyable for him, he feels like he is becoming better at the game and he is extremely happy when he gets Victory Royale with the 49 other people. But when it goes away in the new updates or whatever it becomes hard for him to feel good about playing the game when all he does is repetedly die in solo. So that is the main reason as to why I think it should be a permanent mode instead of just an LTM, people who aren't necessarily good can still have fun with the game, and plus it's a nice mode for a more chill experience.

2) Ghost shots that do no damage: basic game code principle, if the animation is possible than the activity should also be possible. If the gun is not ready to shoot than simply make the animation longer and disallow the gun from shooting until ready.  A good method to use here would be faded out crosshairs to indicate an unready weapon. 


3) Double fall damage bug: make fall damage based on height not velocity, with a special case for sliding down mountains. 


4) Builder Pro Bugs and building bugs in general such as walls trying to build in the air in front of you when you are in a 1x1, build type switch delay forcing you to double or triple press the trigger you need etc..


5) Traps/launchpads/campfires switching by themselves to traps if you select them too quickly


6) Traps damaging players through structures such as ramps and ceilings of houses


7) Traps needs to be looked at: 150 damage + instant activation is overkill

8) C4 needs to be nerfed

9) Shotgun pellet pattern and consistency needs to be reworked


10) Dedicated edit button for console since holding down a button is cumbersome and time consuming


11) Phasing through walls needs to be relooked at. If people get under map because of it then fix that issue but not at the expense of ruining another aspect of the game such as building.

12) Pickaxe pullout delay should not be a thing. Once again because of speed farming exploit, the devs decide to quick fix it by delaying pickaxe pullout as a whole. Btw you can still speed farm so it didn’t work. 

13) Players getting under the map in tilted with shopping carts. 


14) Walls building in ground and inside of mountains. This shouldn’t happen. It might take work to fix but it can be fixed. The sub-terrain should be set at &lt;5% depth of any natural structure earth/mountain/lake and the structure being built should be placed within that 5% depth threshold. This would also fix players getting underneath the map if developed correctly. 

15) Feel free to add anything I may have missed or to provide feedback/support of your own.

I was so ANGRY when the lil pump shotgun (my nickname for pump) got nerfed.

I think they should add the one pump back, because if a sniper (that can shoot at a longer range) can one hit, why can't my shotgun with no range one hit people??!?!?

The pump shotgun fires more bullets per shot, and therefore should hit harder.

My dad plays fortnight competitively irl in Iran, he is a tank driver (or shopping cart driver)  for the US army and had a 5 killstreak last night. He says pump shotguns one hit in real life, so way can they in game.

I only ever played one or two rounds of Fortnite here and there. I think I was account level 6 or something.

To be honest I found the game quite boring. Drop - Walk around - Get killed probably

Yesterday, I read a comment on how the world of Fortnite is constantly evolving, like how the meteor crash in Season 4 changed the entire map and now some of the meteor locations are growing plants again, etc. Really feels like the world is alive.

It reminded me of my good old WoW days, where something would constantly be changing or happening in the world, and players were discovering new things all the time.

So I said screw it and picked up the Battle Pass for the first time. Wow, there are so many things to do now! Things to collect, kill challenges, specific locations to open chests in, treasures to find, skins to upgrade, items to unlock...

Suddenly, this game has become really interesting to me. I like how EPIC has done more than just Battle Royale. The last 50 rounds I played, I didn't even try hard to get first place, I was just doing challenges and having fun.

Also, I've almost earned back enough V-Bucks to buy the Season Pass again in 20 days :D",FortNiteBR

Now the main reason I think it should be a permanent mode is because of my nine year old little brother, he loves to play fortnite but he unfortunately doesn't have much friends to do duo or squads with so he can really only play by himself. Now this is where 50v50 is enjoyable for him, he feels like he is becoming better at the game and he is extremely happy when he gets Victory Royale with the 49 other people. But when it goes away in the new updates or whatever it becomes hard for him to feel good about playing the game when all he does is repetedly die in solo.

We weren’t account sharing or breaking any rules of fortnite.

Every time you kill someone you get a point and by the end of the time limit the player with the most amount of points wins.

And ive noticed that things have been changing too. A lot of the features that are based around skill, such as building and close range, have been needed or changed. There are less materials available affecting building. Building is what makes Fortnite different from every other battle royal. No other battle royal has that function and the nerfs to materials aren’t going to help keep a player base. Newer players definitely do find it hard to close the skill gap (not all new players), but with practice they can definitely catch up. Looping back to close range battles, the shot gun nerf. Shotgun battles are less satisfying and clean. A few people have been discouraged from close range because of the nerf. And i find it’s just not worth the risk. I’m not telling you what to do, I just really like the game as it is. It makes it fun. Of course there are a few problems, but that’s because it’s a beta game. But if it loses its fan base before it comes out of beta that’s not good for business. Building is one of the things that give Fortnite it’s identity and sets it apart from other games. It’s skill based, but people can learn it with effort. Shot gun battles are something I’ve rarely seen in any other battle royal. And by far are some of the most used guns. A lot of the game mechanics that are slowly being changed are what makes Fortnite unique. It adds to its charm and makes it appealing. Changing those things could drastically impact your fan base.

I really hope they change editing on console. Don't get me wrong, I can't think of a better way for it. But I've died way too many times because I have a to hold the button for 2 seconds before I'm even able to edit, especially since traps go off as fast if not faster than it's possible to edit down. There's a setting called ""Tap to Search/Interact"" which I thought would help with it, but I later found out I'm just an idiot and it didn't help, and if it worked how I thought then I wouldn't be able to click ""B"" on Xbox whilst looking at my piece trying to build and accidentally editing instead which would cause more issues. I don't know how to make it better, but seriously people on PC just click a button and they can instantly edit whilst we have to hold a button for 2 seconds.

Spoiled by a company with far less overhead than Epic, Grinding Gear Games, I just feel that the development of Fortnite is either slow... or incredibly misplaced from the community.

I mean it just seems that they add these little items every now and then and expect the community to be satisfied with them, while at the same time displacing things the community has been asking for since practically the beginning of FortniteBR (practice mode, shoulder swap, actual functioning shotguns... etc). 

Dunno, just seems that people think Epic is for the community, but I haven't exactly seen it. Coming from other more dev-to-community friendly games, I believe Epic is far out of touch with their community...

This is my first Battle Royale kind of game.

I launch the game and after registering and logging in, I expected to see some kind of tutorial explaining the basics and controls like most games do, I was kind of surprised to just get into a confusing home menu with no idea what was going on.

My friend is still downloading the game, so I try to jump into a singleplayer room to figure out the controls. I fumble through the menu and get into a ""solo"" game thinking it would be just me against bots or something the sorts. Obviously I shortly find out it ""solo"" as in ""you VS the world"", so after figuring out the controls I just exit the match and wait for my friend.

After he gets into the menu I explain him what I learned about the game and we jump into a Doubles game to try it out.

We both know nothing about the game, I just have the vague idea that you can build stuff. Like two idiots we run around mining resources as if it were minecraft. We get killed shortly and figure we should try to get some weapons.

2nd game, we look for weapons. We die within 5 minutes of landing.

3rd game, I spot 2 barns near a crater and we land there. We get weapons, run around and get killed.

4th game, we try playing safer. We last longer and actually manage to kill 2 players, but we didn't know what all the ""storm talk"" was about. We found out when it shrinked and killed us.

5th game, we last the longest (around 20 minutes) and die.

We got bored and played Mario Kart instead.

We try the game again the next 2 days, but we it would always be the same. We had no clue what was going on, where to go and what to do. We would just waste 10-20 minutes on a round and die in 10 seconds. My friend eventually had it and just uninstalled the game.

I've tried to give it more chances and learn the game, but I've also grown bored of it and felt it was a waste of time. I have not yet uninstalled it but I feel don't feel any will to play it either.

I know that, most likely, this feedback won't really be very welcome here. If devs check this sub and read this do with it as you may.

Don't let the title of the video deceive you or make you angry, put your ego aside and give it a watch, it has a lot of good points.

So I recently stopped playing Fortnite after being my main game since Save The World was available.

Why? Because of how casual it has become, I feel like all of the time I spent on this game to get better was wasted.

It's so sad that this game still is a luck based game, the fact that my accuracy it's determined by RNG is so disgusting and sad. I don't wanna stop playing this game, but bloom leaves me no choice. The already nerfed shottys which were the most ""consistant"" guns in the game (and I say ""consistant"" because they do 8 damage headshots at times which I'm surprised it still is a problem). I know Epic tries too hard to appeal to the casual audience, but if this keeps going then it will get to a point where this game will just be a joke. I know bloom and the game being casual keeps the game fun but it won't go anywhere if it doesn't have a competitive side to it.

Now up to present day and its hard for me to force myself to play this awesome game in the state its in, and as a casual experience its still amazing but now that ive started playing competivily ive discovered that this game will not be competitive because players love the comp side of the game but yet for a piece of that 100mil epic is giving out. Bugs such as people phasing through walls and extremly rng elements such as random shotgun spread make the game feel like its intended for good players to die every now and then to things that they cant control to give bad players a chance. This is completly ok in pubs cuz it helps bad players get kills but just imagine a tourney winner takes 5mil someone gets extremly low dmg when their aim is spot on or someone phases through there wall or they fall off a 2 foot high cliff and die players are going to get pissed cuz there are playing a game competitively yet they die to things that are major problems epic hasnt addressed after many months and these are just a few examples. In the end fortnite is and always will be a great casual game but im afraid the comp scene is going to be players who hate the game but want the money and many will probably disagree with me but i do have more play time or kills than almost anyone ive seen this game at its best and at its worst i bought the game first week it was out before it was even free and i really hope the game succeeds but we could be looking at another h1z1 on a larger scale. And yes simple solution would be to quit and stop complaining on Reddit but i love fortnite and always will i just hope it can succed at a competitve level. thanks for taking ur time to read i hope people can agree we need either the game to go back to a less buggy state or we need a different mode for competitive play thats just my 2 cents hope u guys have a great day!

Ninja tonight has claimed that Video Game Addiction is not a real thing. 
He compared it to ""Oh if I watch the news 10 hours a week, is it an addiction?"" He's made inflammatory statements like: ""You could be addicted to anything, I could be addicted to taking shits, pardon my language.""

He called it politics, which couldn't be farther from the truth. It is the World Health Organization. Sorry if playing 12 hours of video games a day for the last 10+ years has made you jaded to things Ninja, but it's not healthy for 99% of people. 
You comparing an actual mental health problem that millions suffer from, to trivial things to make your 100k viewers meme at is a very bad look. 
I actually respected you until tonight Ninja. I have suffered from gaming addiction my entire teenage life and the comments you made were so inflammatory and triggering. I thought you were an understanding guy. You constantly claimed tonight 'You guys just need to think critically about this kind of stuff and you'll see how stupid it is'. 

Do you realize how far reaching your influence is? If there is a kid out there struggling to get up every day and go to school, to socialize, and to get good grades like I was back then, I'm sure they feel very alone with the statements you made tonight. 

Below are clips of some of the aforementioned statements.

But ya know what would be more annoying? Getting lasered by some try-hard Chad with a scar from 400m away. One of the most annoying things that happens to me is if I get sniped out of nowhere. Now imagine that with every gun in the game. I understand that people think shooting should be skill-based, but also remember the game doesn’t even have recoil. So how much skill does it really require to aim the little white dot on an enemy and press a button? None. As much as we all hate the fact that our bullet misses because of random bullet projection, it keeps the game playable, considering there is no recoil at all.

The positive side to this is more people playing the game and more kids getting into gaming.

The negative side is that it upsets the more skilled players. 

Examples: 
Bloom - this makes bullet aim more random and ultimately gives lower players a chance.

Building nerf - epic has realized that the biggest skill gap lies in building and is trying to shrink that gap by providing less mats.

limited time modes - stats are not recorded and the games are not as serious so good players are less likely to play. Easy way to separate skill levels.

Shotgun damage - I can live with, you mentioned you were looking at consistency, can't wait

Double pump/heavy - Exploiting a bug, if you use it that's on you, they patched it once but reversed it, because it was messing with other parts of the game, not because they thought it was a viable strat. defend it all you want, it's broken.

Materials - game was fine, it's still fine late game, llamas Nerf fair enough, but that floor and chest material nerf has had a huge impact on the beginning and mid game, it's not even discreet, 

I've become such a stingy mofo with rescources since that change because i'm always low despite killing a fair few every game.

It takes 50 wood to build a 1x1, you get 20 per pile, most of the time there isn't enough time to farm either because of the circle or battles. and when you do end up farming IT ISN'T FUN unless you get off on that

 Weapon damage to structures - I thought it was fine before they reverted it, not many people complained, but then again not many complain now, but it does make a difference. this combined with the mats nerf is just heartbreaking to me.

Phasing through structures - MAKE UP YOUR MIND, one minute they don't phase through walls next update they do, next update they don't. you wanna stop people from getting under the map I guess, the incidents were far and few inbetween, add a death barrier perhaps?

There are plenty of threads telling you how best to get XP, mainly through squading up with other Battlepass owners for that sweet sweet friend XP bonus.

There are plenty of chats on Discord with other people looking to team up, so you should have no trouble finding teammates. I’d recommend the Official Fortnite channel:

While some would argue that the grenade launcher is OP, what really grinds my gears is how there is absolutely no risk in using it (or any other explosive for that matter) when your teammates are pushing. I mean, you can apply pressure on the enemy so they have to build to block explosions and can't defend themselves, and have the rest of your squad push and apply pressure on top of them.

My opinions may be controversial, and i don't expect everyone to agree with them. However what i want is for people to try and change my opinion through a discussion, not just people saying ''git gud kid.''   
Just let me know what your opinions are on Fortnite and its progression as well as its current state.

*Quick Summary of my peeves with the game:*  
**Shotguns** have been a consistent problem for months now. Epic took action by removing the double pump, only to bring it back. Whether it was intentional or not does not matter as they have since failed to remove it again. As well as this they recently patched the shotguns by reducing the damage, however this has done very little on the grand scale of things. The clear gap in quality between the shotguns as well as the ridiculous damage range and bloom make the shotguns quite possibly the most frustrating part of the game in its current state.  
**Building** is really the one thing that seperates this game from a lot of other BR games. From season 1 onwards building is the one skill in this game that has developed on a clear and consistent basis that changes how the game is played at its core. Watching how people have become more creative and organised with the building over the past few months is incredible, and has ensured that building truly is an art on this game. Upon the release of the **jetpack (Which is another peeve of mines)** myself, much like many others were excited. However upon its release it became clear that it had a very specific use, which was to be used as a tool to prevent builders from gaining a competitive advantage, by simply holding in a button and rendering the building as a complete waste of time. Of course the jetpack has since been removed (thank goodness) however Epic took the anti-build meta a step further by recently nerfing resources.   


**This is quite possibly the most worrying and infuriatingly out of touch thing Epic have done.** At this point in time, everyone builds. Even players who switch on the game for the first time build, because it is simply a crucial part of the game and has been recognised as such. This is a great thing, however what it means is that players often have very little resources when killed. When you take this into consideration, as well as the fact that it already takes a considerable amount of time to harvest resources, how and why could you possibly decide to nerf resources? 20x resource in chests, and 200x of each resource in llamas (mainly for duos and squads. 200 is good for solo) is absolutely ludicrous. Building is the one thing in this game that is entirely about skill. To take the ability to build with ease away from players and force them to spend minutes on end harvesting just to be able to get one pumped in the face after hitting a 6 damage shotgun shot twice, pretty much sums up why i am at a point where Fortnite has become both boring and annoying.   


And finally i hate the *''Random shrinks''* which are so repititive it is sad. And i hate the fact that players are not rewarded for landing in high risk locations, with anything other than kills. ",FortNiteBR

Once everyone lands and all chests are searched, players either quit the game or commit in-game suicide to have the challenge registered. Now you have about 10 or so players gone because they either completed some of the searches or couldn't complete any so they are off to the next game leaving a disadvantage on numbers of players in current team.  At this point, it is pretty much pointless to continue playing since the opposing team has a greater # of players so now more players continue to leave the game.

I'm not sure how this would work if you can't get exactly 100 people into a game. This would be easier in solo mode since one person gets the entire pot, or in duos b/c splitting an even pot between two ppl is easy. Anyway I know that this would be a popular game mode due to the low-risk high-reward concept! And since all V Bucks are bought by individuals Epic wouldn't be losing out.

I'm probably late to the party.  Is now still a good time to join, or more realistically a month from now when I get back from some traveling?  A couple of concerns:

1. I'm so late to the party that the game isn't popular anymore and I can't find people to play with online most of the time.  This happened to me with Killzone, when I bought it 3 years after release date.
2. I'm late to the party and the party is still going strong, but everyone that're still playing are all super veterans that destroy me every time and I wouldn't be able to even have a chance of noticing a confrontation before I get killed.

So sometimes the Chug can be a burden to carry around, most of the time I will take a bunch of minis over it. So an idea I thought might work well is being able to drink the Chug jug to a certain percentage of your choosing, just to make it carrying sometimes more useful. So say you’re at 50 shield and 50 health, you can drink just half the Chug and save the other half for later use. Maybe have different increments of Chug you can consume; 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, or full. Another possibility is just drinking a certain random % of the Chug based on your health needs, so you can see your health and shield go up as you drink it, then just stop when you’re full.

I started playing in end of season 3 thats where i got in love with the game. So far i play everyday and i try to improve. I got around 30 Wins.

Sometimes i do really good end up with 8-10 kills but sometimes i just get completely demolished especially in the beginning mostly when i drop.

I play 90% Random Squads (i got no friends to play with), i rarely do solo.

I watch a lot of Youtube Videos or Streams how ""Pro"" Players are playing and it helped me a lot. My Building is pretty good, my editing is also decent(sometimes when i know its a 1v1 i try to get the kill through edits so i can improve my edit skills)  my aim is okayish it gets better with time (with building i mean i can build quick 1x1s i can double ramp wall push ppl etc.)

My Question is what is the best way to be really really good. 

And for that i mean should i start spamming solos? or is random squads fine or even better?

Everytime i die i take a min and think about what i could have done better and try to bring that to the next game.

Hopefully someone can help me out &lt;3",FortNiteBR

This is when first shot accuracy and damage fall off was first introduced and eventually added permanently into the game. But it seems like Epic has quietly swept shooting test #2 under the rug and hoped we would all just forget. For those of you who don't know or have forgotten, shooting test #2 was planned to remove bloom COMPLETELY from the game and replace it with recoil and perfectly accurate weapons. You can still find videos on YouTube from when they ""accidentally"" released it for a few hours one night. Ever since first hearing about it and then seeing it in action in some of the videos, I felt this would be the perfect shooting mechanics to make Fortnite more skill based and rewarding. Everyone who was lucky enough to get the chance to try it out said how much they loved it and how great it felt to finally not have to deal with bloom. I'm hoping that if this post can get enough attention Epic may finally release the LTM officially. If it received enough positive feedback it might even be implemented into the standard modes one day. At the very least they could tell us their reasons for abandoning it completely.

I, like many others, were delighted to hear that Fortnite was on the Switch right after it was announced at e3.

However I was disappointed to find that it lacked 2 major components of Fortnite. Save the World, and Battle Royale stat tracking.

I was worried that because the Switch is less powerful and much more mobile than XBox and PS4, that it would just be essentially a better looking iOS version, and I was for the most part, correct about this.

And I just wanted to know why this was. Is Save the World coming eventually? Or is it to much for the Switch? Where is the Career tab? And why do stats not track on the Switch?

I know some of it is a joke but 99% of the things he says to him are mean as hell or just him complaining about Tims level of skill. It's hypocritical for someone who preaches positivity 24/7.

I also stopped because of the lack of actual gameplay. Since he plays full squads there's not as many fights where he has to try. I started watching other solo squads or duos players instead. 

Anyway, just wanted to see if anybody else switched to other steamers and has any light to shed on this. Ninja is still a great player and a philanthropist, just my thoughts. ",FortNiteBR

Is there anything at all I can do? (already e-mailed and tweeted @epic, they didn't reply on twitter and e-mailed back an auto generated response saying they will not provide a reason and will not unban me).

I don’t want to stop playing it, but I just can’t find myself having fun for more than an hour or so without getting bored. In the beginning I could play for countless hours and I’m sure many people can relate. I feel that season 5 is a good time for a new map that is optional so players can stay with the OG if they’d like. Having a new map almost feels like a “new game” because you get to discover everything for the first time and it feels way more rewarding. I have zero knowledge about game designing and programming but since battle Royale has been able to grow this fast, I feel like they can easily deliver a new map that will be well received by the majority of players.

2. Option to automatically enter a queue for a new game if playing solo so that you don’t have to go back to the lobby after each game 

3. More rewards and challenges. I’m not suggesting copying cod in any way, but just as a reference I’d like to see the amount of individual and customizable challenges that games such as cod WW2 feature. I think it’s an addition that just furthers the players interest in the game because it’s more tasks to complete etc.

4. Whenever LTMs are released just please make it so it’s one box with the option for solo duo or squad. I can’t think of any reason why sometimes LTMs have solos and duos but no squads etc. 

Thank you if you took the time to read my suggestions, I hope to see some of your opinion on what you’d like to see as well!

Reasons why it’s bad

1. Camping is now being encouraged even more

2. You can’t check if the bush is a person without revealing your position 

3. There are so many bushes on the map it is highly likely you will get caught out

4. It increases need for lucky RNG in the game as it is a huge advantage 

5. It is almost impossible to learn all the locations of bushes

6. It is another item that we have on our inventory making even more selection involved

How to fix

1. Make it a placeable object only

2. Reduce to 1 (from 2)

3. Make it rustle every 10 seconds or have a sound cue 

4. Remove it from chest (this would only make it it the final circle where there would be less bushes to check)

Edit: 5. What do people think about all bushes able to be destroyed, with 100hp each.  Please let me know your opinion in the comments.",FortNiteBR

https://imgur.com/a/At8fm

In the picture the red circle is where your bullets COULD go, the center dot is only the center of that circle. In this example the target is probably only taking up 35-40% of the crosshair meaning every shot only has that percentage chance to actually hit. The crosshair (red circle) expands while you move and fire, crouching will GREATLY tighten that crosshair (red circle) to improve your chance to hit. Higher tier weapons not only do more damage but have smaller crosshairs and tighter bloom (crosshair circle expanding) while firing.

Hopefully this quick explanation will help those that are frustrated by the mechanics and allow them to understand things better.

EDIT: This does not effect scoped rifles, scoped assault rifles shoot dead center of the scope and snipers are the same except they are the only guns that have bullet drop and projectile speed to also account for.

Seems like another game that was fun while it lasted, but fell off. I'm not sure what the developers are even doing. So I'll just leave a review, just going to be honest. It's just an opinion. Here is what the developer's messed up on.

* The new UI is trash. It's less user-friendly, the dark colors are ugly for a cartoony game, and it has even broken on me by not allowing me to drop weapons or pick new ones up. I even had a weapon become invisible to me on my toolbar. What was the purpose of this exactly?
* Sniper bullet projectiles are still insanely slow, the equivalent to an arrow shot from a bow. Never have I've ever seen a bullet travel so slow in any other shooter in existence.
* Tactical shotguns still dominate close range combat, to the point that it's not worth using anything else. Weapon bloom can be ignored, jumping is recommended, and getting close to a player when you have one is the ultimate cheapshot.
* Weapon accuracy is still crap, where we're forced to crouch and aim and yet still miss.
* Dying is still way too fast, which is why you guys intentionally made accuracy be possibly the worst in any shooter in existence. Have it ever occurred to you that that maybe you should tone down weapon damage instead? In that way, we can actually take damage and react to gunfire, not just die instantly or hope weapon bloom unfairly and randomly screwed your opponent over.

So many fans being so positive, but absolutely no REAL issues have been dealt with, whatsoever. Fans going to hate and downvote as soon as they read my title, but seriously, this shooter isn't that great and crucial problems are completely ignored.",FortNiteBR

Season rewards were a great idea and made me want to continue playing the game even more to rank up and get rewards. With this new system, not only am I not inclined to care about grinding up the levels but now I feel less like further supporting the game with mtx. I would much rather have a different system implemented for season rewards such as a new currency gained from winning or placing in the top 5 or 10 spots.

85,tkRustle,1510087532,7bg3nn,24,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7bg3nn/the_cosmetics_and_monetization_are_going_the/,32,The cosmetics and monetization are going the greedy way (Wall of Text),"Let me just make this clear first - **I do not mind microtransactions in a free game and I support well implemented, balanced ones**.  Also, I like most things Epic done for now, and I would love to support them. However, current direction of monetizing the game raises concern of both myself and multiple people in the community.

First of all, **price and value of content purchased**. I'm sorry, but if 1k Vbucks equals 10$, then you are asking me to pay 8 euros/dollars for [this](https://puu.sh/yh1l9.png). By the way, this skin is just a recolor. Yes, the default black girl skin has yellow clothing, this one has red. 8$ for a color change. Yes, the characters do take a lot of screen time, but this does not warrant a price so outrageous for such a measely change. And there have been many other skins like this in the rotation, just a recolor and some image slapped on and bingo, 8-12 dollar price tag. 5$ for a black-green glider recolor that I will see once in 20 minutes? Really?


Second is the **VBucks packaging**. Here is an example - rare skins cost 1200. I want to buy that skin and I have zero VBucks. Naturally the lowest avalible package 10$ for 1000 does not cut it (coincidence?). And then, *HOLY SHIT* turns out the next option is 2800 for 25$. A goddamn 15$ difference. Of course I can buy 2x10$ but the point still stands. What if I want to buy just a single glider? Have to overspend 5$.(I may spend those extra VBucks later, but RIGHT NOW I don't) This is why additional currency when buying cosmetics is scummy, the prices are somehow always out of range.

And the general spread of package prices is both scummy and excessively high, we have the 10$-25$-60$-100$ spread. Thats a really stupid spread that does not allow any small purchases without overreaching as I proved above, and seems to be outright aimed for whales. If you do the additional currency, it should offer more smaller options rather than more big ones. A good example would be 2-3$, 5$, 10$, 15$ package pricing and *only then* you slap on big packages with currency bonuses for those who intend to stay and spend. This way people with less cash feel fine making small purchases here and there. I honestly thought this was the well known monetization 101, but apparently not, and unless I can drop 60$ right now I can go fuck myself.


And then there is the skin situation in general. Many people assumed that presets were just a placeholder and we would get some basic customization before cosmetics (yes I know you can't change the model in Save the World, no, I don't care, all BR's do the customization, a very simple face editor can make thousands of people more invested in the game). You know, just race/hair/eyes etc, nothing excessive or fancy, and then standart universally appliable hats on top. What we got instead was not only cosmetics before(instead) customization, but cosmetics that define the preset model you are using. And you **cannot even** select vanilla preset to use. So right now not only it's no-customization, but you have to **PAY** minimal of 10$ (a shitty recolor) to select a preset model to play as. This is so obviously intended as additional push for money that I won't even discuss it further. You can have skins to force the model but can't give player the button to force the model? Yeah right.

Oh and just dropped in today's blog, we now unlock additional skin purchase options when leveling up. Yes, thats right, not skins, but we unlock the button to **buy** them. Fancy and rewarding, not like that shitty emblem for the banner nobody can see, right. [here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/v-1-8-2-patch-notes) under the Pickaxe picture. Also somehow everyone is very quiet about it. Hmm...

In conclusion, Epic should monetize the game, but I do not belive they are in such a dire situation that they need this level of greed really. Ignoring any additional items that could be monetized, current state is fairly easy to fix.  Add face/race customization and preset selection for the lazy ones (for free, in case its not obvious, maybe with a weekly possible reroll), add additional VBucks packages at the lower spectrum and rebalance the prices so that I would not have to pay 8(actually 10) dollars for ""COLOR RED"", make all skins universally applied on top of your character regardless of model. **That's the baseline.**         There are many debates about whether earning skin/currency rewards  incentivizes cheaters, so I won't write about that, but ideally of course players should be able to earn a decent cosmetic inventory just by playing. 

I expect to be downvoted by blind fanboys, but I'm hoping that instead my post will spark a healthy discussion to make the game more enjoyable for everyone. The happier the community is, the more they spend and more new people come in, the more Epic profit, good old goods-goods exchange. Thank you if you endured throughout this pile of text.",FortNiteBR

-  ""Check your entitlements!""

- ""Nobody is forcing you to buy anything!""

As I mention in the post I have no issue paying for MT's I just find the way this system works, with forcing you to play another mode you're then restricted to progress in (as you're saving for BR) is a bit of a mess. The introduction of the Season Shop just exacerbated that issue for me. 

I want to support Fortnite but I feel there could be a better system implemented to do so. 

**Edit 2:** Since most people seem to think my primary issue is with the price; it isn't. It's far more about pushing people to play PvE as a means to earn currency for BR, and as a result limiting the progression (and fun) you can have in the mode you're being pushed to play. 

You're obviously playing BR heavily if you're going after the Season Store items, so it seems bizarre to then push people to a mode where they can't progress in it (as they're only there to get items for BR, which is the same currency as the packs in PvE) and have no interest in playing at that time.

*That's* my main issue.

- - -

I love this game, I want to support this game and I bought the Founders Pack to do so but seeing the systems in place, and now with the Season Store, the entire monetization of BR is one big hot mess. 

When the season store unlocks, if I want something I'll have to: 

1. Spend hours in BR to unlock the luxury of actually buying items 
2. Go into PvE and spend hours getting the currency I need 
3. This gets more tedious as time goes on as I can't spend any of the currency in there for upgrades, as I'm saving up for *time limited* items in BR. 

So basically you're making me play a mode I may like, but don't wish to play right now (I'm playing BR and I'm wanting BR items), and then making that mode more frustrating as a consequence as I don't want to spend the currency on PvE items as the only reason I'm playing PvE (at that point in time) is because it's the only way to get the items I want in BR. 

Surely it's not that hard to see why the above is a total mess, so why are you doubling down on it in every way? I'm not scared of cosmetics at good prices, I've spent a ton in Overwatch. 

This system forces me to unlock the luxury of being able to buy items, and then forces me to play a different mode to get them, all the while not allowing me to progress much in that mode as a result.

The alternative is to pay £20 for two items (currently a purple pickaxe and a blue skin). That's not worth it relative to what I can get in almost every other game for the same price. If you were a little less aggressive in the pricing and forcing people to play PvE when they might not want to, then the chances are you could have earned about 5x what I've currently spent on the game by now. As it stands, I won't buy anything else because I can spend the same amount in almost any other game and get far more. 

Game is amazing, but this whole system stinks and needs addressing.",FortNiteBR

We heard about Fortnite and thought we'd give it a try.  Now after having played for a few days (and even winning a handful of times) I can say that I genuinely don't know if I'd ever play Battlegrounds again.  

Fortnite feels so much more focused on the game at hand, and for the most part feels much tighter and precise while keeping that focus.  A lot of the times when playing Battlegrounds it feels like you are fighting the game and aren't focused on playing it.  Dealing with shoddy vehicle physics, camera misalignments, glitches, and more recently all the hackers really takes away from the focus of it being a battle royale and makes it feel like a loot collect-a-thon where you aren't fully in control.  Fortnite though feels like you have that control.  You don't have to worry about attachments or vehicles or any random crap, it's just you and your guns and your ability to outplay your enemies.  You drop in, grab a gun, and get straight down to business and I really appreciate it.  Not to mention the building mechanic which adds a whole new layer of depth to engagements and how you can approach situations and move around the map.  I think it's a much more enjoyable battle royale experience because of all of this and I'm glad that we found such an enjoyable and seemingly polished game.  

So yeah, coming from Battlegrounds to this is a huge breath of fresh air and my friends and I are all much happier for it.  Just thought I would share my experience so far.",FortNiteBR

I had several experiences where my crosshair was actually in the way of seeing the enemy's head. I find it annoying because I am used to playing with a dot on CSGO. So I searched how to make a custom crosshair for Fortnite but didn't find anything useful. 

Thankfully /u/Fossafontless had submitted a pretty good tutorial on /r/Competitiveoverwatch.
**So here is the guide on how to add custom crosshair:**

1. Download Overwolf: https://www.overwolf.com/. Oh by the way I found a pretty neat App for Fortnite https://www.overwolf.com/app/Convex_Apps-FORTMATE 

2. Download X-hair-0.0.1.opk from https://github.com/OverwolfApps/OW-crosshair/releases/

3. When the Overwolf program is opened click on settings and navigate to Support &gt; Development Options

4. Click on ""Install extensions.."" which is in top left corner and select the *.opk file you just downloaded.

5. When this is done go to Hotkeys and bind the keys which you will use for Show/Hide and Close.

6. Now Open Overwolf again and click on the icon of the X-hair.

7. Start Fortnite, enter match and adjust your crosshair with the arrows. 

8. When you are done with the adjustments go to Fortnite's Settings &gt; Game &gt; HUD &gt; Reticle - OFF. But you HAVE to be in Battle, because in Lobby the option is not available. 

Thats all folks, hope it helps you!",FortNiteBR

Lately I've been wondering about the direction this game is going. With the anouncement of the 1.8.2 patch, it seems Epic games just wants us to have fun playing the game. Which obviously is perfectly fine, but I've always been interested in eSports myself. 

So I guess my real question is; Does FortNite have any ambitions going towards the eSports scene? 

And is it possible with a game where RNG is quite a big factor to the game?

It raises the skill ceiling. There are so many advanced strategies you can do now.  It doesn't break the game. It's really risky and never really rewarding. 

But it looks so cool. Especially when someone does something useful like in those twitch clips we have been seeing here where they kill someone while riding a rocket.

Ok, here's my suggestion: **Tournament Mode**.

* First Round, ~5000 people (wait times may increase), **50 matches**. Top 20 of each match qualify.
* Second Round, 1000 people qualified from first round. Distributed evenly in **10 matches**. Top 30 of each match qualify.
* Third Round, 300 people qualified from 2nd round. Distributed evenly in **3 matches**. Top 20 of each match qualify.
* FINAL Round, 60 people qualified from 3rd round. **One match**.

At the end, a nice scoreboard with stuff like: Winners of each round/match, Most kills per match, Most kills overall, etc.

Some facts:

* To win the whole thing, you'd need to be in the Top 20, Top 30, Top 20 and then Top 1. Shouldn't be that hard for pros.
* The FINAL match is only 60 people instead of 100, which gives each player a better chance at not dying on landing.
* In between matches, you could add a scoreboard view.
* Cosmetic rewards for tournament winners?

You will only be able to get this item from chests and loot crates. In addition to this, when not crouched your legs will be visible, so to be completely disguised you must be crouched.

At the moment, you can essentially hop from bush to bush with ease. The only times you are actually visible is when you are moving between bushes. This provides a very easy way to hide in the open, and either camp out until end game, or get some easy kills. The main point I want to make is that bushcamping is already a completely viable strategy. 

The bushcamping playstyle promotes passive and stale gameplay that rewards players with lower average skill levels rather than higher. Getting headshots with an auto sniper from a mile away takes skill, camping in a bush until endgame and shotgunning the last guy in the back however does not.

So, if camping in bushes for the win is already a viable strategy, why would Epic make it even easier? I am legitimately curious if anyone has any thoughts on how this new item will promote, fun, interesting, and fair gameplay. Because all i'm imagining at the moment is someone getting this item and literally camping until endgame, because if they are going for the win-- why wouldn't they?

I personally enjoy the competitive aspect of this game, and adding in whacky items that literally encourage campy/stale playstyles doesn't seem like a smart choice for the longevity and fairness of solid gameplay.

If anyone has any thoughts on the subject I would love to hear it.

TLDR: The new item encourages campy/stale gameplay as well as buffs the already completely viable strategy that is bushcamping.",FortNiteBR

However I absolutely do not understand making guns have random, completely RNG based recoil. I know they're more accurate when you're not moving, I know they're more accurate when crouched, but none of that makes up for the fact that sometimes, no matter how pixel perfect your aim is, the game decides to not let you register shots. RNG is literally never a good way to decide if bullets will register or not. I really enjoy just about every other aspect of this game, but the fact that sometimes gunfights come down to a coin toss of who's shots are going to register has me really frustrated.

Although at close range any shotgun is better, if you don't have one then a good jumping headshot with the revolver can down most enemies.

It mostly works in fortnite, except for 'K' - Every time I try to rebind 'K' to walk backwards, it just completely ignores the command.  
I can rebind any other key to backwards and it works fine, similarly, if I try to bind 'K' to any other command, it also ceases functioning. 

It just seems as if 'K' cannot be rebound, I remember seeing something similar in Blizzard's HotS, and it turned out it was hard-locked into being some sort of menu key, until they fixed it.

**TIPS**

when the circle is closing in a good strategy is to close in on the smallest gap to the next circle as this will be where the next storm closes in the slowest. you can also somewhat gurantee where enemies are because often i will close this gap and not fight anyone along that quadrant of the circle making it obvious what part of the next circle i can expect enemies to be.

if you have to pick up your friend you often want to build around the downed friend before you pick them up so that you can't get hit or as easily flanked.

use grenades that you find, often you won't find an rpg or grenade launcher and just have grenades but they can be just as useful now.

don't always go straight to executing enemies that you down, you may want to keep your gun loaded for their friend just around the corner or save ammo in general, particularly at the early stages of the game.

try and maintain a height and shoulder angle advantage while fighting or moving, you can wallhack with the third person camera and i believe the hitboxes are much better when shooting down at someone than up at someone aka it is easier to headshot the dome of their head than their chin from underneath.

to add to the above, be wary of getting pinched between two or more squads, sitting in small valleys between two ridges for example is a really shit place to be caught in. part of this means be aware when you are starting a fight with a squad of where you don't want to be flanked from by another squad who has heard your fight.

when pushing a player made construction with explosives be aware that if you blow up their construction their squad may all come out at different angles like ants from an anthive getting you swarmed if you are the one pushing the base.

take the time to line up your pump shotgun shots at close/medium range, its easy to feel spammy because the tactical shotgun works well jumping around spamming your shots but the pump is like a cannon with a slow enough rate of fire that taking the time to line up the shots is worth it. 

shooting the AR accurately at mid/long range is best done crouching and tapping your trigger. there is a closer range where it feels instinctual to autofire but you often miss everything. i have no huge issue with the gun. try to get a burst rifle anyway, they're just better.

when your squad lands in a town, if one of you takes a roof with a gun early it is better to hold that roof and call for your friends/hold the area down than to go straight to looting the rest of the house.

**SUGGESTIONS**

its been said to death but make the white/green AR more accurate. nerf the shotguns midrange power.

i'd like to be able to lower my hudscale as i would personally have it 50% smaller than it currently is.

there are too many white smgs on the map in the loot tables especially given there is two types of smg. pistols and revolvers are great, let us have more of them.

i'd like to be able to have hold to crouch as i never use crouch toggle in other games

different crosshair options could be nice however the current default one is quite good as far as default crosshairs go.

shoulder swapping should probably be added to the game.

I might be biased when it really comes down to it though considering my playstyle usually envolves a lot of engages which results in me being shieldless in the endgame.

There are some decent YouTube videos out there, but I haven't seen much written. The few I have seen have been pretty lacking and say pretty obvious things, and there are a lot of things I wish I'd known in the beginning. So without further ado, my tips and tricks guide for Fortnite Battle Royale:

&amp;nbsp;

#**Beginners Tips**

- **Use and stick close to cover.** Move from tree to tree to get a closer shot, hide behind rocks, etc. You're a sitting duck out in the open, and if the nearest cover is a 15 second run away, that's 15 seconds they have to potentially down you. In that situation, you'll need to start building cover, but the chances of it being destroyed are high. You can also abuse third person camera and stay unseen behind cover while still keeping an eye on your enemy.

- **Play some practice rounds.** ""But /u/thesomeot, there is no practice mode!"" Correct, but in a roundabout way you can kind of create your own. They're not true practice games, but they certainly will help you get better. Just drop into the first city the bus flies over, try to find a gun quickly and fight anyone you see. You'll probably die pretty quick the first few times, but this will help you get used to Fortnite's gunplay. I used to land in ""safe"" areas, but then I'd spend 5 minutes playing hiking simulator and get killed by the first person I encountered because I was no good at combat. This method gets you in and out quick, and helps you gain valuable experience.

- **Learn when to engage.** Remember, this game is about surviving, not getting kills. If you see someone far away and you don't have a sniper, don't start shooting. You probably aren't going to kill them, and you're alerting anyone else nearby where you are. Wait, see if you can sneak up closer and get the jump on them with a shotgun. I don't know how many games my friends and I lost early on because we still had the ""kill everyone"" mentality other games instilled in us. (Per /u/samwrocks, this can be put you at a huge disadvantage if you are running from the storm or will need to be soon. Pick your fights carefully)

- **Be smart about your building.** It's very easy to spot someone building a structure in the distance, and if I see a giant fort I know someone's probably there, and so does everyone else. Save your resources for clutch cover building or end game bases.

- **Share ammo with your squadmates.** Snipers and rocket launchers are rare, so I would recommend giving your heavy bullets or rockets to the person on your squad who has the respective gun. You can also give someone your ammo, have them fill their magazine, and give it back.

- **Stack items with your squad.** No need for each of you to be carrying one medpack, have one person carry all three and free up inventory space. As long as you stick close you should be able to share.

- **Hit the blue circle while you're destroying things.** It's actually embarrassing how long it took for me to figure that out. Instead of doing 50 damage you'll do 100 and destroy the structure quicker. It also gives you extra resources (/u/misterjoshmutiny).

- **Look for ammo crates.** I actually didn't realise they existed until I'd been playing for a while. They're [small, green crates](http://orcz.com/images/a/a0/FortniteBattleRoyaleSearchAmmoBoxes.jpg) that are often on shelves.

- **Drink your shield potions right away.** No use carrying them around, get those shields up immediately. Don't hog them either, try to spread your potions evenly throughout your squad.

- **Fire your automatic weapons in short bursts.** We don't need to get in a fight over weapon bloom here, but I think everyone can agree that continued spraying is renders your gun effectively useless after a few shots. Try to shoot in controlled bursts to retain what little accuracy the weapon has.

- **Rebind your walls/stairs so you can easily access them.** You need those in MANY situations where you don't have any cover and need to build something FAST to outplay your opponent (/u/Carnlioni).

- **If you get caught in storm start a ramp before you exit.** It's really nice if there is trees just inside circle as well as giving cover right at the height your ramp pokes out (/u/TrannyBlower). I'd be careful with this one, however, if someone sees you building they may be able to keep you pinned down at the outskirts of the storm.

- **Make sure your structures have connection to the ground.** If any structures don't have a connection to the earth, they will collapse. Meaning if you build a stairway to heaven, someone can shoot the base and send you to hell (/u/Thoraxe41). This also means you can knock down the pre-built towers, a good method to kill/damage/disorient if someone doesn't notice you sneak up to the base.

- **Pay attention to enemy death animations.** If you're playing duo or squads, watch how people die/go down. If they instantly warp out when killed, you're good. If they just go down, watch out. That means they still have teammates alive (/u/Thoraxe41).

- **Grab all the guns in the beginning.** Early on if you see multiple weapons of the same type, grab them. Don't leave just cause you already have one. That's 30 shots you're leaving behind, especially when ammo is at a premium (/u/Thoraxe41). Your squadmates may also not have had a chance to get anything good, so you can share like the kindhearted player you are.

- **You can split your ammo.** Press X (PC) to bring up a slider from 0 rounds to all your rounds, and is in the middle by default (/u/ShouldIRememberThis). Holding shift and dragging and dropping also drops half ammo (/u/JustARandomGuy95).

- **Crouching increases your aim.** It decreases your bloom (spread) making the shot more accurate. The way to decrease it the fullest is to crouch, stay still and zoom in. It's good for ARs but it's not worth doing when close range with a shotgun. Also, crouching doesn't affect scoped Sniper Rifles (/u/Mastur_Of_Bait).

#**Advanced Tips** 

- **Use the compass to call out locations to your squadmates.** ""He's over there!"" could mean anything, but we have a handy built in compass to help, and it even has specific degrees for accuracy. This one is a real game changer and I noticed my squad doing much better after we figured it out.

- **SMGs and pistols have their uses.** Some may disagree with me, but generally the SMGs and pistols (to a lesser degree, per /u/Liron12345)  aren't great and are easily outclassed by the other guns, but I have found they can be useful for a few things. Light bullets are pretty common, but other ammunition is not always so I prefer to conserve it if possible. I'll use my pistol/SMG to kill downed enemies, destroy cover, or suppress enemies.

- **Try to time your glider deployment properly and reach the ground first.** When I first started I would try to skydive horizontally as far as I could to get to my target, but that ended in me being slower to reach the ground and missing the good loot (and usually getting killed because of it). It may be in your best interest to go as far down vertically as you can and use the glider to cover the horizontal distance. You'll make it to the ground quicker this way and be able to have first pick of the loot. Additionally, try to land on top of structures. You can either break the house roofs down and get the golden chests in the attics faster or just drop to the ground that much quicker.

- **Learn some building patterns.** There are a few good patterns to build a quick fort, which can be useful in the late game. Try looking on YouTube or watching a good stream. I'm partial to a 2x2 with spiral stairs leading up and a set of stairs on top to snipe off of.

- **Order your weapons logically.** If you have time. You can enter your item menu and re-order your items. This allows you to put a close range weapon after your sniper to decrease the time to switch to a proper weapon if someone gets close (/u/Thoraxe41).

- **Cover ground faster.** If you're going a long ways away from the bus, the fastest way to cover ground is to spam the button to go back and forth between glider and skydive. Once you get about a grid block away diving straight down and gliding over is best (/u/Tatersalad96).

- **Get used to spamming buildings for cover.**
Condition yourself to spam build your preferred quick structure whether that's something fancy or just a wall. It takes time to turn that into muscle memory but I spam build a wall and ramp every time I get into an unexpected fight. It can literally block any fire from a enemy in front of you because you can build walls when standing on stairs nonstop by spamclicking. They will just waste their ammo but be aware this strategy can use up quite a bit of resources. Sometimes it is better to run behind other cover while building walls in the direction you are getting shot at from. Building walls around the stairs is recommended if you are staying in the spot (/u/T3ER and /u/RicktheOG).

at the same time, i think: (1) their maximum usefulness only arises in one specific situation; and (2) that situation doesn't really arise all that often.

let's explain these points one at a time.

(1) you get the most value out of them in cases where: (a) you've lost over 25 health and shield; (b) but you only have bandages to replenish your health, or nothing at all, or a medkit that you don't want to use to replenish a relatively small amount of health; (c) and you don't have a potion to replenish your shield, or you have a potion but you don't want to use it to replenish a relatively small amount of shield.

i think the developers may have been envisioning that you would use the shield potion quickly either during or before combat, but (i) this is too risky, even with the short cast time, and (ii) the effect is insignificant, both because the full increase to health and shield is relatively small, well below what can be taken away again by one or two gunshots, and because it takes an extremely long time in combat terms for that full increase to take effect.

as for (2): the situation described in (1) doesn't really happen that much. it's very rare that i'll have picked up a slurp juice but not a shield potion or a medkit or both. and i'm always willing to use potions and medkits to bring me from ~75 to ~100 shield and health. you might think you'd want to wait until you take more damage later, and then use your medkits and potions then to regenerate more total health and shield. but the probability that you'll survive that fight later on, especially starting out with a quarter of your health and/or shield missing, is too low -- so i keep myself topped off whenever possible.

the upshot is that i consider slurp juices pretty low value. i certainly like having them when i have no other means of replenishing health or shield. i also like them when my only other means of regeneration is bandages. and if i have a medkit but no potion, or a potion but no medkit, then i'll hold on to slurp juices. but if i have a medkit and potions -- or one of these two, and an extra weapon i want to keep hold of -- then i'm dropping the slurp juices. a slot is way too valuable to devote to juices based largely on the possibility that the one specific and fairly rare situation where they're nice will happen to me this time. i often just use them when i'm full on hp just to get the shield, rather than holding on to them and waiting for a critical moment that could easily never happen.

in short, slurp juices are easily worse as they are than medkits and potions, even though i take it they're supposed to be better given their rarity level; and they're very low in my hierarchy of things i'll drop in preference to other things i happen upon. to be as good as their rarity suggests they'd have to be seriously improved in some way. maybe you could make it possible to consume them while moving again, or even further shorten their consumption time, or something. but as they are, i feel like they aren't as useful as you meant for them to be.",FortNiteBR

But I figured I'd share some of my tips and tricks to help others possibly get their 1st Solo win since I just walked my boy through his, watching him on share play. I've been playing for about 5 days and already have 7 solo wins.

1. Play the bush game
-Find a good bush, and take a look at yourself from above to make sure you're completely hidden. Make sure the barrel of your gun isn't sticking out. If it is, equip a medkit or potion or something that's not a gun so you stay completely hidden in the bush.

2. Pick and choose your battles
-Just because you see somebody doesn't mean you should engage, even if they're trailing you. The name of the game is ""survive."" It doesn't matter how many kills you have, as long as you win.

3. Pump shotgun
-This, IMO, is probably the best gun in the game. I've won a solo game with my highest tier weapon being a green pump shotgun and the rest were grey. The damage is insane and the range is actually really good. Whenever I'm running, even if I'm in the wide open, I run with my pump out. If I come across anybody, chances are its gonna be close range and I've already got it equipped. If I encounter somebody further away where the pump does me no good, well then they're already far enough away that I can pull out a different gun. Always, always, always, have a pump. I'll use a grey pump on somebody before I use the purple tactical shotty.

4. Land away from big name places
-When you first jump, don't go for somewhere big name like Loot Lake, or Anarchy, or wherever. If you're playing solos, find somewhere away from these places that you know has a couple houses or loot locations nearby. I have a place that I go that I usually can loot about 4 or 5 houses before I encounter 1 person. And by then, I'm already so stacked with weapons, potions, and health, that they're no problem at all to deal with.

Last and most important
5. BE PATIENT!!!
-When watching my buddy (G), it came down to the last 4 people. He's sitting in a bush when out of nowhere comes guy #1. 

G- ""I can kill him! I can kill him!"" 
Me- ""No! Don't fucking move!""
G- ""But I can kill him and loot his stuff!""
Me- ""Don't fucking move!!!!""

As soon as I tell him that again, here comes guy #2 running over to kill guy #1.

Me- ""See! If you would've moved for guy #1, guy #2 would've been right behind you.""

So guy #2 kills guy #1, and as he does guy #3 starts shooting at guy #2 from a distance.

G- ""I can kill guy #2 right now!""
Me- ""DON'T MOVE!""

So he sits there in a bush for what felt like forever while guy #2 and guy #3 are fighting it out. Literally shooting rockets and snipers and AR's right over top of my buddy's head! I keep telling him to wait. ""Just wait man, let them kill each other, then come out of nowhere and kill the last one."" And sure enough, give it about a minute later when the storm starts closing in, guy #2 and guy #3 rush to the middle and start fighting hard, as soon as guy #2 kills guy #3, my buddy is right in the bush behind him, takes 2 shots with the AR, game over. First solo win ever for my buddy.",FortNiteBR

3. For no reason opened chest is still selectable for 1 second after it was already opened. It even makes the sound and animation of chest looting, but its already empty. What's going on?

4. Auto loot works only if you stand on ammo, you still have to tap E if you want to grab it from distance.

5. When picking up an item while holding ALT the item does not appear in the inventory, you have to re-toggle ALT again to make it appear. (bug?) Same with doors, there's 5% chance door cannot be closed after opening it (no selectable animation for E). Also why do you stop running after opening a door while running?

6. Dragging items is clunky, half the time you miss it and have to re-drag for no reason to make it work.

Sometimes you get killed from couple shots. How is this happening?

When you see ""hit impact"" animation the bullet hits the target, right? I'm aiming to the head. Why none of the shots register? I can even see white dot on the head, but nothing hits the target.

And here:

I loved the game from the beginning, and although I am not the best player, I have my fair share of wins.  With the recent update there was so much potential to make the mode much better, but then they buffed the shotguns.

Shotguns are now god guns that you need to win.  Here is my game experience for my past few games:
Find a legendary scar - pump shottied
Have 200 hp, 3 medkits, and an extra shield pot - pump shottied
30 m from my enemy - pump shottied

Another problem with the update is the uselessness of slurp juice.  It is at best just as good as a shield pot, but has purple rarity and so many disadvantages.  The only time they are useful is when I get out of a fight, heal up with bandages, and then don't get into a fight for the next 30 seconds.  Imo they should reduce the time from 25 seconds to around 5 seconds, making it viable in combat.  Because if they don't, I don't see a point of them being in the game.

To start, I am from Slovakia and we have different keyboards here because in our language weve got a lot of symbols (*ľščťžýáíéúäňô and more*) and as you can **[see there](http://www.ucitelka.wz.sk/obrazky-piaty-rocnik/sk_klavesnica.bmp)** these symbols are on our keyboard instead of numbers. When we try to switch weapons with default keybinds is not working because Fortnite cant register them. Even if i try to bind it on these keys its just not workin. If i want to use these keys regulary i have to switch keybord in windows manually(or Shift+Alt) on English.

It would be really good if Epic can support our community in Europe and add/fix opinion to bind to our keys(+ľščť...). I think thats not only problem in Slovakia but in our neighbour country Czech Republic and I think were not alone.

1. Do not hold your trigger down ever, if they are close enough to hold your trigger down then use a shotgun.


2. If someone is 300m away you probably cannot kill them with an AR, the game is like this to force strategy and closer quarter fighting.


3. The secret to killing people is, as follows, crouch, shoot.... wait a fraction of a second and shoot again. If you have good aim you will manage to hit them.


Look I will say what none of you want to hear, if you are complaining about bullet bloom you either have bad aim or do not know how to play the game. Bullets are hit-scan so there has to be bloom or the game with be ruined, unless they change gun mechanics to real time like the sniper, which is almost impossible in third person I would say. 

Last thing, here is a video from a post of someone complaining about bloom. Actually watch his centre dot and you will notice the shots he misses are not aimed at the guy.

For 3 weeks I played Fortnite without headphones.  I knew they would help, but didn't have the xbox adapter to connect my Beyerdynamic dt990's.

I finally got the adapter and played 2 games with my headphones.  I am absolutely blown away at the difference it makes.  Before I could hear footsteps and know that someone was in the house, but not sure where. Now I know exactly where the are.  The range of footsteps is also increased, so instead of getting shot in the back I can now turn around and see them coming.  I can now hear exactly which direction shots were fired, drastically increasing the amount of players i see throughout the game.  The direction of supply drops is also more clear.  This could be placebo, but somehow my shots seem better too because I'm more immersed in the game.

In 2 games with headphones I got 16 kills and 1 death, far better than average.  I feel like I was a 6/10 skill level player, and by simply putting on headphones I jumped to 9/10.

I need to test it fully but for now I need to go off my experiences from my previous matches. Sharing yours too would be a big help with this topic.

At about 5 to 10 feet away, I've seen the tactical shotgun do upwards 158 damage on a headshot. Meaning even with a single shield potion, if someone comes behind me and domes me with a tactical shotgun then I won't have anytime to react. Given that and it's RoF, then it's a a power house in the close range area. I don't have any long range data for the tactical but I'm sure I'll get some soon. 

As for the pump shot gun... It's a beast of nature. From a solid 20 feet away, I was able to headshot someone who was shielded, killing them instantly. I'm sure their shield was already damaged but that is still a whopping 100+ points of Damage I did.

I have never won a solo game, but then again I don't even have 24 hours in the game. But after 100 games I always seem to come up just short.

Today I finished 2nd and 3rd one time each. After getting 4 kills in the 2nd place game and 3 in the 3rd place game, I can see that I'm getting better. Usually I snuck into the top ten with 0-1 kills, but now I'm picking up 2-3 regularly and games I go really deep in I get 4-5. I always seem to lack that little something to win the games though. I even had a rocket launcher a gold AR and Bolt Sniper in the 2nd place game, but the splash from a rocket launcher the other player fired hit my cover and took me to half health and I lost the shotgun fight.

Aside from the usual tips like
""Just play more"" or
""Get gud scrub kid lolololol can't even win a solo wow so bad""

What are some tips that can help gain even a slight advantage to get a win?

Isn't the game fine in its current state? I mean I can understand that you might want to have global leaderboards, but everything further will make the game less enjoyable. You guys call for skill brackets and skill based matchmaking and if you keep crying and get your will, you will most likely NOT enjoy the results! Battle Royale is a Mode that is already very competitive as it is and meeting people of different skill and having a little bit of chaos is what makes these games fun. It also is the best way to compare yourself against others. You can see if and how often you win and how many gun fights you win. You also have the chance to meet better players and learn from your deaths. You have therefore the chance to improve really fast and track your progress without a stupid number or a fancy border telling you whether you are good or not. Having ranked and skill based matchmaking will look as followed. People will avoid fights since you can be sure that everybody else is atleast as good as you are. Being under the top 50 and having 2 kills would become a thing to celebrate about. As soon as you get into a new bracket you will get raped in your first matches until you can handle higher elo gameplay. The subreddit will be flooded with salt and whining and crying about how bad the ranked system is and how unfair they got placed.

The whole skin system could be better.,"I feel like this is just an excuse to make you buy a skin when you really want to play with the same model every game. In my opinion, this is not only a bad design choice but also bad business.

Do you feel attached to the characters in this game ? Me, not at all. The reason for this is that they have no name, no personality, no history, no nothing. They're just generic models. Tying skins to characters works well in games like Overwatch or LoL where characters are unique in many ways - the reason why you buy skins in these games is because you want to look good and unique with the hero you are attached to.

Fortnite doesn't have that, but because the characters look generic, it has a **MASSIVE opportunity** that other games don't have and that is *character creation.* 

**Here is the skin system that I propose for Fortnite** (the specific pricing is a very different topic that I won't touch) : 

1) You can create your own character from scratch for a certain amount of V-bucks. You can choose the sex, height, morphology, hairstyle, skin and hair color, and so on. 

2) On top of that you can buy skins that can fit on any character, at a lower price than they are now.

You now find yourself into one of two situations :

- you don't want to spend money, you play with a randomly chosen models among the base 8 models.

- you want to spend money, you can get yourself a pretty damn unique looking hero that you can show off on the battlefield.

The money that I would spend on this... (still haven't spent a penny on the current system and never will).",FortNiteBR

This means that any time I do put into a game needs to be optimized.  I have found that Twitch can be incredibly useful for learning a game while not playing.  I use the mobile app on my phone so that during down time I can pull up a streamer and interact.  For anyone like myself I would recommend a couple of streamers that have been quite useful to me.  
Obviously Ninja is one, he is an incredible players and goes for high kills often.  He also explains his own as well as his enemies mistakes on a regular basis.  
The most useful streamer is less known however, or at least less followed. ImTheMyth  this kid is an absolute beast.  He has a ton of wins, and just today streamed from 0700 central usa time to 1800 central usa time. during those 11 hours he racked up 12 wins.  So great win total, but he is also very good about answering questions about his gameplay, and explaining his strategy.  I have learned a lot from watching him, and while he does not get the 30 kill games, because he is not a head hunter, he does win more than anyone else in the USA on PC. 

Anyway I have learned a lot, and figured I would post this to let you all know the learning tool is there.  


Oh and my favorite moment from watching a few games today, ImTheMyth landed after another player multiple times, but rather than get scared or change his game plan, he simply waited until the other player broke through the roof, and then looted the weapon faster then the other player and then promptly killed them.

What follows is a suggestion I heard from somewhere (don’t remember where) and I think it solves the problem cleaning, effectively, satisfyingly &amp; without the potential for abuse (although I’m not as nefarious as some of you so please correct me if I’m wrong here or even just if you have a better idea) 

So take the following example where we have Team 1 with two players: Player A &amp; Player B

If Player A knocks down or kills Player B give player B the option to insta kill (not knock down) Player A via a nice big button next to the report player button. And if Player B presses the button make sure Player A gets a large splash screen indicating why they died and shaming Player A for team-killing.

Why I think this solution meets the 4 criteria I listed above.

**Cleanly**: It’s the additional of one addition button that is visible only when a teammate of yours kills/knocks you down.

**Effectively**: By allowing victims of team-killing to kill their killers you remove the most if not all of the incentives that killers have to kill their teammates. Killers don’t get to use their dead teammates loot if their teammates push their kill switch, so why would they kill?

**Satisfyingly**: The other thing that’s really nice about this solution is it gives the victims of team-killing some satisfaction in knowing that they can react and punish malicious team killers.  I can’t tell you how frustrating it is to be killed by a teammate and then watch him loot me and carry on their merry way.

It also gives players the flexibility to recognize when something is done maliciously and when it’s not. As an example if a teammate is less than smooth with a Grenade or rocket launcher and player B recognizes that they can choose not to kill their own teammate. This is where giving victims the kill switch clearly out shines an automated solution in accuracy. 

**Non-exploitable**: Given that the kill switch button will only exist when someone kills someone else on their team I don’t see how it could be exploited. If you don’t want your teammate to kill switch you then don’t kill them. Seems pretty simple...

This is Plix and i'm back with another design for you guys to use in the battle field. I got a lot of positive feedback on my 2x2 Design for late game but I noticed that a lot of people still prefer the 1x1 design in certain scenarios. Well.. Fret not! For I am here to bring you an improvement to the infamous 1x1 with stairs build. This design will improve your ability to defend all sides of your 1x1 while providing cover and mobility.


In addition to this design I provide a solid 2x2 design that costs only 40 resources and allows you peak from all sides of the base and enter and leave from all sides. These two builds I believe with take your base building to the next level and give you a serious advantage over your opponents.

They're the only resource in the game that is very rarely picked up from killing other players. While it's common knowledge that killing a player leaving a high population area is the easiest way to guarantee a concentration of powerful weapons, the same can't be said about shields because they're almost always used immediately and drained when killed. So it's a consumable that benefits the bold, that career snipers usually won't have as much as, and benefits the playstyle that's all but required to find it.

Of course, you can find a purple shotgun, two shields, and a medkit immediately and begin camping, but hey that's rng. Shields are fine as they are, as the only consumable typically only found by looting. Although a visual cue that someone has a shield I might argue for, since this game so heavily encourages choosing your engagements. But that's another discussion.",FortNiteBR

The hovering name tag also causes situations where you mistake an enemy as your teammate. If there's an enemy 5 meters away from you and your teammate is 20 meters further in the same direction, his name tag appears above the enemy making you think he's your teammate. There's other examples too where the name tags can cause unnecessary hassle, not gonna list them all though since I think I already made my point clear.

I'm not sure if the highlighted outlines should be seen through walls by teammates or not but any kind of highlights would be a good start. ",FortNiteBR

Happy Friday!  Hope I'm not stealing the thunder from the post I saw the other day, but I wanted to share a couple more FREE Fortnite-inspired stream skin options with everyone.  

&amp;nbsp;

[Here's a pic of the two skinz I created.](https://imgur.com/XMHauaP)

&amp;nbsp;

And here are the zip downloads.  Each comes with free images and PSD files -  [**Package 1** (left)](https://www.streamskinz.com/uploads/1/5/8/4/15844568/streamskinz-fortnite_package_01.zip)  [**Package 2** (right)](https://www.streamskinz.com/uploads/1/5/8/4/15844568/streamskinz-fortnite_package_02.zip)

&amp;nbsp;

**Short description** - Left skinz: I based these off of the look of the in-game menus. Banners/icons can be edited to represent your personal banner in-game.  Right skinz: Tried implementing the characters and Epic's advertising more in this one.

&amp;nbsp;

Also, first 5 Fortnite Heroes to PM me with their deets (twitch/username, social media links), I'll edit their chosen skin package for free and send them to ya.  Note - please let me know which skin it is you're looking to get edited when you message me.

*Edit 1: u/bswmagic has claimed the first free skinz edit.

*Edit 2: u/true97 has claimed the second free skinz edit.

&amp;nbsp;

Finally, if you end up using these, please let me know so I can see 'em in action.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks, and enjoy!

If your a fan of competitive shooters dont look for much in terms of skill, like most poorly Free For All games the 2 factors you need to win are Positioning and Map Awareness as Bloom is present and will bring most even gunfights to a flip of a coin.

In terms of progression we have season level which you can level up via games and daily challenges but kinda becomes pointless after lvl 25 as there are no rewards beyond, aside from that there is leaderboards but theyre are randomly picked people and based only on wins... so yeah..... no skill there.

Customization is blocked behind a paywall and there's no way to earn vBuck except through PvE (Save The World) for the time being which means if you want even basic customization you need to put some money upfront, sure you can mess with the Banner but not many are going to see it.

Also so gameplay on console seem to becoming more and more unstable with each update, hopefully we will see these issues fixed but for now all we can do is wait.

Personally I think alot of people are letting the ""F2P"" part cloud their vision and that maybe the game was a bit over hyped for the way it actually plays out, hopefully Epic will get the game in a better state soon, as PUBG arrives on Xbox 12th Dec and I can see myself and others like me jumping ship for the more competitive game.

Anyone else feel like we as a community gave the game too much credit or overhyped it abit?

There has been discussion about the way guns are handled and getting rid of spread. So, my question to you is would you rather have Hitscan weapons with more recoil and no bloom or Projectile based weapons like in PUBG?

I don't personally want guns to become projectile based... because then this game is basically PUBG and other BR games with building and a destructable environments. I think Hitscan guns are apart of what makes this game different than other games alike.

Adding recoil and removing bloom would add a degree of skill to the weaponry in the same way that removing hitscan and converting guns to projectile would just in a different way. 

I think that making the guns have more recoil but remain hitscan would be the way to go if EPIC want's to have it so casuals can still l earn to aim as the core fundamental of hitscan is simply point and click. The only other thing they would have to learn is to pull down hard enough to keep the crosshair on the enemy and to make corrections when it isn't. In my opinion this is easier than adjusting for bullet drop/leading your bullets because you can still see your crosshair on the enemy and I think this would benefit the game far greater than projectile based gaming. This change would cater to both the more serious FPS gamers while still allowing the casual player's to more easily learn how to aim well.

As this is my first post on this forum try not to slaughter me, nevertheless I thought of an idea that could help with Fortnite’s playability. First some backstory behind me. I’m a downright competitive person. I’m competitive over anything and everything, I’ve played everything from Counter Strike to Overwatch. I was also a competitive mobile eSports player at a point in time, cringey I know. I feel that I have a decent grasp on competitive esports and I cant confidently tell you that Fortnite is NOT and eSport’s title. But what the team can do is add a sort of MMR, matchmaking rank, system to entice players to become better at the game. At this point in time Fortnite’s leveling system basically tell you that you play the game a-lot, not how good you are at it. Im proposing a proper matchmaking rank system that pairs you up with people of the same rank, more or less. I think the system should have the same season system as we have now; except for their to be exclusive season rewards for placing in different ranks. I know that as an Overwatch player, I’m extremely compelled to play for the golden guns at the end of a season. I’m no marketing guru but I also think that this could help the marketing side of Fortnite. When more people are enticed to play the game, then there is more of a chance that the game will be bought.

I like variety in game, I like to have options and be able to chose different rifle such as m4/AK in cs, AR/AK in H1Z1 etc. But the 3shot rifle is awful in every way. It doesn't feel right when you fire because it's clunky, and it's full RNG. One time you hit all 3 shots when you are barely pointing at the guy, and the next time you hit none while your crosshair is directly on his body. 
Would also like to add that the RNG factor is still way too present with the assault rifle but it's nowhere near the semi-auto catastrophy.

What about switching this weapon with a more rewarding one with a better system like a spray pattern and that would be better than the AR in close range ?

I even posted on the Discord and an Epic member replied linking me the recent patch (which unfortunately didn't aide my frames).

My current build : 

&gt; • i7-7700k @ 5.0Ghz

&gt; • 16GB Ballastix 2800MHZ @ 1.4v (XMP)

&gt; • Asus STRIX GTX 1080 8GB

&gt; • NVMe PCI-e SSD 512GB

&gt; • Evo 850 SSD 256GB

&gt; • Caviar Black 1TB 7200RPM

As of right now, I've tried these things to combat FPS drops and get the most out of my 144hz monitor :

&gt; • Install on a HDD and not PCI-e SSD

&gt; • Install on a SSD, and not a PCI-e SSD or HDD

&gt; • Use Command Lines in Epic Launcher 

&gt; • Download and use some people's cfg files

&gt; • Reinstall the game entirely (In current processes, I'm on my 7th reinstall)

&gt; • Attempt all lowest settings

&gt; • Allocate all CPU Usage to Fortnite in realtime (Only uses 45% of my 7700K still)

&gt; • Purchase new RAM as my old LPX blew one stick (Absolutely NO change, currently using Ballastix 2800MHZ 16GB)

&gt; • Partition, install windows clean on a new SSD 

&gt; • Run in Compatability mode (Doesn't launch)

&gt; • Run as Admin 

&gt; 

None of these changes have added to my FPS. I often hit 120 FPS, although microstutter and drop to 30-60 for a good amount of time. Especially during gunfights and important times (end game). 

Also do note, the load my system is experiencing is normal. CPU usage is roughly at 45%~, and Memory at 55%~.

When I do play the PVE aspect of the game, I easily hit 200+ FPS and rarely drop below 100. 

If anyone has any suggestions that would be wonderful. I've been attempting to reach out with no avail so far. It's been quite frustrating as I enjoy this game, although I'm unable to at this time.",FortNiteBR

462,Luckmod,1509653650,7ae8f5,41,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7ae8f5/advanced_tactics_discussion/,89,Advanced Tactics Discussion,"I'd like to include a list of tips or tactics that may not be immediately obvious to a newer player. If you guys have any to add, please comment and I'll add to the original post if this picks up.

Tip #1) You can edit building structures both before and after you place them. On Playstation you hold circle to do this. This can allow you to make many copies of a certain pattern or quickly alter an existing structure. It can be much faster than breaking a structure. You can edit your own structures and your teammates' but not enemy built structures.

Tip #2) You can create a wall that gives you an advantage for shooting around due to the camera being only on the right. Go to build a wall and edit it before/after placing. Make it so that the blue panels look like this: (O = present, X = missing)

- OXX
- OOX
- OOO

This will create a slanted wall that will let you shoot around cover while keeping most of your body covered. Keep an eye out for the red dot to see if you will end up hitting your own wall or not. You can use crouching to quickly pop up and down so that you can spend as little time as possible out of cover while getting off shots.

Tip #3) Launching off of either type of launch pad will prevent you from taking any fall damage. This can be especially helpful when trying to quickly get down from a mountain or if you no longer want to stay on your skybridge. They do have an arm time before they can be used so it's usually better to have one down before you need it, not after.

Tip #4) Floor Tiles and Roof Tiles can be stacked for extra vertical strength. This can be good protection when someone is building above or below you since it can quickly provide two layers of structure that they will have to shoot through to get to you. [This is also helpful in making skybridges sturdier] (https://youtu.be/7d0cRRf-_Gg?t=818). In addition, you can place either of these tiles through the other one, similar to how you might build a wall behind a set of stairs.

For example you are on the right side of a set of stairs:

\ x

And you want extra protection, you can sit on the stairs and place a wall on the other side through them so you end up with

|\x

The same applies to the floor and roof tiles and alternating can create strong, dense structures.

Tip #5) If you are full on items or need to save time by bringing an extra item closer to a player you can juggle the items with you. You can repeatedly turn 180 degrees while picking up and item so that you throw it in front of you and then when you pass it, turn around, pick it up, turn around again so it goes in front of you and repeat. [Example] (https://youtu.be/7d0cRRf-_Gg?t=260)

Tip #6) A lot of players will build a 4 sided box with a ramp inside. A good counter to this strategy can be sneaking up to it and placing a roof (4th Structure Option) on top of the box. You can then safely place a Floor through and under it to double up on the strength of the cap. Many players will freak out and not being able to successfully edit their building in order to get out and may start destroying their own structure. This strategy can be especially useful if the structure is near the edge of a storm and may cause them to be killed by the storm before they can get out. What makes this trick good is not the lethality of it, but the mind games you can play on your opponents.

Tip #7) Your crosshairs are a guide and show how potentially inaccurate your shots are. The dot in the center of your crosshairs should be used as a guide for where your center point is, not the exact spot your shots will go. As you can see with [this image] (https://imgur.com/HVusuuB), there is a lot more red in the left image than there is in the right.",FortNiteBR

I mean, it's ridiculously obvious that the play in that case is to not engage unless is necesary because both teams got to close while healing or something like that, but if you're at their backs and they don't know you're there you only have to run and engage them while they healing as soon as both get to the safe zone and it will be an almost guranted win over that team, you'll have time to loot and still be able to win the match.

The only weapons that are viable are the scoped rifles / snipers and the shotguns. The assault rifles are useless because of the RNG. The pump action shotgun is a better AR than the ARs because you can hit accurate shots at medium range with it that would completely miss if you were using an AR. 

There is a simple thing that can fix every problem with the shooting, make the first 2-3 shots go where you are aiming (or with minimal RNG, like 25% normal spread) when you are crouching. That would make every weapon instantly more viable and competitive to the scoped weapons.

If a loud hissing noise was added as well when close to the bomb it could open the possibility to help mask steps in the close vicinity and trap sounds as well making them more deadly vs people pushing indoors.

The game can already detect all the possible chest locations for any location as we've seen in the past, so why not just have the 7 chest location quest randomized? That way player A still needs to look for 7 chests, but he can do so more enjoyably because player B has a different location to search for chests, spreading all 100 players around the map evenly.

The toxic ruthless cluster f**** grinds that happen each week (because hell, everyone wants to get more stars for more items, and who can blame them?) 


The kill at *this* location quests are less of a problem because you can migrate into the area after the initial landing and get your kills. The chests however are only there for people who initially loot the area, leading to cluster F****s. 

Don't get me wrong, this is just a trivial complaint, and the new season is fantastic! Just something I feel can be improved. ",FortNiteBR

steps in photo:

1. go into settings, &amp; click on keybinds tab.
2. choose any of these, it doesnt matter which one you set to a key.
3. i have chosen x because it is right next to my crouch so it is easier.

steps in vid:

1. swing your pickaxe like normal for one swing.
2. emote by clicking the key you set it to, in my case 'x'
3. crouch immediately after you emote, then crouch again so it stands you up.

When I started playing I was running 150-200fps consistantly and I freaking loved the game.

Then tilted towers was released, and this was the first time a city large enough to drop me 50+fps was added to the game. I still loved the game and was sad to say that i had to stay clear of one of the main attractions of the game.

Then came season 4... I don't know what happened but gradually over the seasons my fps had just been dropping... At this point I was 80-100fps in main map (and I know it might sound bitchy, but when u are used to 144hz and 144fps it's really terrible.) and about 50-70fps in tilted, at this point i also started having problems with rettail dropping me 20-30fps. I truly started playing a lot less in season 4 (only hitting lvl 70).

Today season 5 came out and  I was truly hoping to see some peformance enhancements... But yet again my fps dropped dramtically. I am currently running 50fps in the main areas of the game (smaller cities and areas such as shifty or salty) and even less in bigger cities. Im sad to say after having played and loved this game... Today I uninstalled it.


tl;dr

Over the season my average fps has dropped from 200 to 50 and I  decided to uninstall the game today.",FortNiteBR

I was expecting it to be smooth and nearly flawless, like how it feels in Splatoon 2. But Fortnite isn’t Splatoon 2, so of course there were differences in the feelings. Gyro controls in Battle Royale felt kind of stiff and choppy. Gyro movement along the x-axis was faster than y-axis, for some reason, which made strafing while shooting a bit of a pain, and cost me a Victoy Royale... I only have myself to blame for not winning, but more precise and fluid gyro controls would’ve helped out a lot more. ADS, especially with scopes, was kind of painful to use. Sometimes when tilting the controller just a smidge, the camera wouldn’t follow, if not barely. Overall, I’m glad that there are gyro controls, I really am! I just hope that it gets improved or touched upon in the future to help this new playstyle feel more comfortable. Fellow Switch users, any thoughts you’d like to add? I’d appreciate feedback and maybe tips on how to utilize the gyro controls in their current state.",FortNiteBR

Season 2: Dont get me wrong it had some cool items such as the Black knight and sparkle specialist but it only had 70 rewards and 4 skins

3. Season 4: Really cool battle pass Omega and Carbide were really cool and customisable and teknique was also a cool skin, You could also unlock the visitor. Only problem with this season was battlehawk and squad leader were bland and stale and level 80 for omegas lights it to high because some people cant grind that much.

2.Season 3: Amazing season  it had John wick as tier 100 which is really cool and is very special to me since john wick is one of my favourite movies ever. the elite agent was a really cool skin that is super thicc. The dark voyager was a awesome skin and felt really awesome to unlock. The rust lord is a pretty cool skin but is trapped in a troll stereotype.

1.Season 5 This season just came out and its really cool, The tier 1 is pretty cool but when you upgrade it its absolutely amazing and for just 10 dollars for this pass its an absolute steal. The sun strider life guard skin is the thiccest skin in my

opinion and is very unique.  the drift is a amazing skin because you then dont have to buy burnout :).

The viking girl is decent and  i really like the sledgehammer skin it reminds me of blackbeard from rainbow six siege which is one of my favourite games the rook is really cool aswell but the tier 100 absolutley stomps omega and john wick

I know Fortnite is a heavily casual game. Very young players. Very VERY young players. Fine, I like the game too. And community's not a problem when you already have people to play with.

But I was hoping for more ""serious"" skins. Something that is more mature, less aimed at the very youngs among us. I really liked Season 3 Battle pass. In fact, I am still sticking to my John Wick or my Rust Lord. I like them. I really like my dark voyager too. Those feel good to wear in battle ! Imo, by FAR the best battle pass we've had. 

Season 4 BP was fine, I guess. I didn't like the grind it needed to get to level 80, and I stopped at level 50-ish, because I didn't enjoy either the Omega or Carbide. Didn't need to grind.

Season 5 BP is, imo, too much. I won't spend the ridiculously low amount of 10€ (Yeah, I'm from EU) even for this. We're getting more stuff, yay ! But only ""Yay"" i*f you enjoy having Toilet Paper rolling from your hands when you're diving.*

I don't know where this will lead us. I'm afraid Epic has run out of cosmetics ideas. I really like the direction the game is taking gameplay-wise and map-design-wise. Cosmetic-wise ? Not at all.

Basically if you can't get a full Tier 100 skin within a season, no problem, you can complete it next season, or whenever you want! That means we no longer have to grind for 2+ hours per day (as was the case for the level 80 Omega skin), as there is no longer a time-limit imposed on these challenges.

Honestly, this is the best change to come from season 5. It benefits everyone, especially casual players who have full-time work/school, plus other commitments such as family, SO, gym, etc...  We can finally enjoy the game at our own pace while seeking these rewards.

- 90% of the items from the battlepass are not as nice as any other season (that's bringing it soft)
- Toys really
- Cars really ??..  
- The rifts just puts you in the air again so woohoo another jump pad..
- No scene at the start of the game (atleast i didnt cuz my news always likes to pop up in front of everything first.
 
things  i do like;

- The new desert place (altho my fav spot is gone now)
- The new lobby screen


This is my personal opinion but I'm sure i wont be the only one. I'll probably won't buy the battle pass or maybe when i get the v bucks from the login rewards but im not spending money on this. The previous season had 1-2 skins that i really wanted and now i rather have my old ones. I really hope this game won't die. Btw what is this theme anyway?

The divide is mostly between casuals and hardcore players. Of course the voice is louder of the casuals, who are larger in number, but there are many who are upset that they don’t have a reward for all of their work they put in. The problem with the way they are doing it now is that they are starting to allow previous season completion in new seasons. If they do this they might as well let previous battle pass owners (season 2 especially) complete their final tiers. Black knight actually required a lot more work than tier 100 skins now. Them allowing previous battle pass completion is it takes away what’s special about battle pass rewards. After the seasons over it’s over and if u didn’t get everything then oh well. The casuals argue that they paid for the battle pass so they should be able to unlock everything without too much work. The solution to this is to add a level 80 reward for THAT SEASON ONLY. It wouldn’t be a battle pass item because if someone gets level 80 without an exp boost or anything like that then they deserve to get the reward as well and people can’t say that they paid for something they can’t get. It doesn’t have to even be an outfit. I’m sure many would be happy with a glider, emote, pick or anything really. They should also reduce the level of progressive challenges required to max out tier 100 skins and lock them to that season only. I think this is the best of both worlds and would make more people happy. I would love to hear what you guys think.",FortNiteBR

-They had become very common place to run among all players which I can tell bothers most of you, however, after the recent smg buff I would at times go pump/heavy in to tac smg or drum and I noticed others were as well.
- Can't forget to mention that many complained about shotguns being so weak yesterday and today are saying their glad double shotgun meta is gone because it was ruining the game.

I'm not saying that this must be reverted back because I'm sure I will be able to adapt and thrive with the new meta in due time, however, I can't be the only one who no longer feels confident when pushing into fights anymore and is annoyed by the constant spam of tac smg/ drum gun while trying to build.

**Before you jump to understandable conclusions on the title of this post, please read everything first! :)**

On May 27th, I was getting intermittent kicks from Fortnite, firstly in Save The World, and then in Battle Royale (hence why I'm posting in the STW sub) - I know that when many of you read the title, you will understandably assume that I'm guilty, but I'm going to do my best to explain why I'm not.

After the intermittent kicks on the 27th May, I did the right thing and contacted Fortnite Support, asking them why I was getting kicked, and I wanted to make sure my account was okay. They told me that my account was absolutely fine and that I should just restart my game. With all due respect, I had already tried restarting the game, my computer, verifying the game and reinstalling the game. [Less than 24-hours later, I was banned.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8n36uj/account_disabled_after_being_told_it_was_in_good/) If I was using Cheat Engine, why would I contact Fortnite Support before the ban? It's also impossible to launch the game with Cheat Engine open, and with the minimal knowledge I have of it, I doubt Cheat Engine would even work on a server-side based game.

For example, I've had Steam for 10 years as of this September, and over a thousand games, many of them multiplayer. I've never been banned from a single one. I'm very careful with what I have running. 

I created a post on the battle Royale sub (as linked above) just to retrace my steps (back before I was told I was banned for using Cheat Engine mid-game, something that is impossible to do) and seek any help I could find, and there were quite a few supportive people. After hassling some staff members on Twitter and Reddit, I finally got some support, which is when I found out that I was banned because of Cheat Engine. This baffled me because I'm exceptionally careful about what I run when playing multiplayer games. I've also invested a lot of time and a bit of money into the game, I would never want to risk getting banned from it.

Not that this is terribly important, but I suppose it serves as a character statement for myself, when I won my first game on the Battle Royale gamemode, [I posted it to the BR sub, because I'm deaf and it was my first win which I was exceptionally proud of.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8b7358/hardly_skilled_but_as_a_deaf_gamer_im_proud_of_my/) It gave me the courage to reach out to other players who would like to join me in BR, and be understanding that I may not be able to hear as well as the average player. I ended up on the front page of Reddit and I had a hundred friend requests on Epic Games. My confidence soared through the roof regarding my deafness for the first time in a long time. I played games with people who were so understanding, and it was something I had sought in a multi-player game ever since I was a child.

Aside from one person I've spoken to from Customer Support, the rest have been very unhelpful, assuming that their information is 100% correct and refusing to listen to, or acknowledge any of the further information that I'm presenting, which are:

* Having contacted Fortnite Support during the kicks before the ban, and being told everything was okay.
* Impossible to launch Fortnite with Cheat Engine running, you are met with a splash screen. (Tested this on another device with a new and unused account after being banned.)
* I contacted Easy Anti-Cheat out of curiosity, and they confirmed that no suspicious activity was detected coming from my account.
* Most importantly, perhaps, I discovered later on that a Cheat Engine FAQ page was open on my main browser on the day of the kicks. I was researching how to change a value for something in the single-player game, Mad Max.

The latter info was obtained after I posted to the Cheat Engine forums for the first time to ask them if it's possible that Cheat Engine can be detected when it isn't open, and somebody said if you have a website page open with any blacklisted words, you will be banned. Out of curiosity, I checked my history, and on the 27th May, I indeed had the Cheat Engine FAQ page open. (I have about 50 tabs or so open at any given time, it's a mess and I need to sort myself out! So, because of this, I wasn't aware that it was open.)

So, I believe that the kicks flagged my account to Epic Games' Anti-Cheat Team, and they saw that Cheat Engine was being detected in some capacity, and I was banned. With all due respect, what I do in single-player games should not affect my standing in multi-player games, it never has before Fortnite. I very rarely use it to begin with, I only use it when I return to a game to play it a second time and adjust values to make it a ""New Game Plus"" for games that don't have that feature.

I've no idea what caused the kicks themselves, perhaps the game was detecting the website. Either way, the kicks must have flagged my account to Epic Games, and then they saw that a blacklisted word(s) was being detected and banned me.

I'm not sure what I hope to gain by posting this, I've exhausted all of my options thus far, but I just know that persistence is key, and that I shouldn't give up. I'm guilty of having Cheat Engine installed, and of having its website open, but I am not guilty of cheating or having Cheat Engine running while Fortnite was running. Why would I contact Fortnite Support before the ban if I was trying to cheat? It would be silly of me. I really feel that their support needs to be improved, drastically. Again, I understand that support have to assume that I am guilty, but even after giving them the benefit of the doubt, showing that there's more proof that I am innocent than there is of me being guilty, and they don't want to entertain the idea. This kind of support is archaic, quite frankly.

I've sent a few staff members a message on Reddit again, just asking for them to prove to me that ""cheatengine.exe"" or whatever was running mid-game, because if they have that information, it's a simple case of showing me, because it wasn't running and I'd love to see what information they do have. Sadly they won't reveal anything in-case it can be exploited by genuine cheaters. It makes me question the extent of their information, to be honest. If Easy Anti-Cheat, a company/software solely designed to prevent cheating, didn't detect any suspicious activity coming from my account, why did Epic Games' own in-house Anti-Cheat Team ban me for such a benign reason? I've missed out on 3/4 of Season 4, and now that Season 5 has begun, I'm hoping to get this overturned as soon as possible. I am aware that I can just do a clean install on my computer and play on another account, or play on another system with a new account, but I don't want to, my purpose here is to try as hard as I can to prove my innocence to the Support team.",FortNiteBR

I want epic to make a 3rd tier of challenges that are really hard and there to be like a level 80 skin or maybe a skin for anyone who completes ALL the challenges. Just something a little more challenging to achieve. For reference I was level 79 the day I got omega (finished season at 95) , so it was definitely fun but didn’t feel like a challenge at all

I understand not everyone can play as much as I do, but epic should at least do something for the ones of us that can.

Starting in Season 5, progressive challenges will no longer be restricted to a single season. You can now complete progressive challenges at your own pace.

Progressive challenges are now completed by acquiring a fixed amount of XP and is no longer dependant on your season level.

Does this mean that getting full omega still is possible?

Did the xp amount reset from last season or did the xp carry over?

How do i track the amount of xp still needed for full omega?

Me and my friends love the game, but we do get a little tired of shooting someone and them building a fortress in a matter of seconds.

Patch 5.0 has introduced a bunch of new playstyles to even the odds a little.

Rifts:

Is an enemy sat inside a castle? Enter a rift, skydive down and infiltrate their base from the roof. 

No more getting pinned down from an enemy way up in the air. 

Vehicles:

Outrun the enemy, run them over, ram their base, or drive into a rift to get yourself out of a sticky situation.  

Storm circle adjustments:

Potentially my favourite. The storm circle now occasionally moves **outside** of the safe-zone. 

You can no longer rely on building a massive base and staying there 'til the end of the match.

Players will have to abandon their base and travel, risking exposing themselves.

Therefore, building is a lot less viable than it was.

The meta was very varied, some people still using double shotgun, others using shotgun + smg (which was stronger imo), others using straight up smgs without a shotty. It was a great how they managed to change the meta so there wouldnt be a dominating strat (double shotty) and there would be lots of variety. 

But now with the removal of double shotty, im guessing the meta will shift to shotgun + smg. And it will be like the double shotty all over again. And in my eyes, any meta with a dominating strat isnt a enjoyable meta in the long run.",FortNiteBR

Well now, anyone who was under level 80 and had omega can get the max omega. And thing is, they don't even have to grind 80 more full levels. Take a look at this, it was in the v.5 patch notes

""Progressive challenges are now completed by acquiring a fixed amount of XP and is no longer dependant on your season level.""

That basically means that progressive challenges are no longer restricted to a single season, and can be complete over the course of your entire Fortnite career. They can be completed with a certain amount of fixed XP, and your season level no longer matters. 

This is HUGE. Now all the omegas that actually grinded for level 80 will be no different that a omega who is at stage 2. Wow fortnite dick move. I myself, spent the last 5 days grinding for 6+ hours a day to get to level 80. Once I got it, I felt so alive and joyful knowing that I'm in a sacred community of max omegas. But now, I feel like shit and I want to switch back to league. Fortnite lost respect to the ogs and now they lost respect to most of the pros in fortnite.

RIP

So here's a quick summary

* **Starting in Season 5, progressive challenges will no longer be  restricted to a single season. You can now complete progressive  challenges at your own pace.**
* **Progressive challenges are now completed by acquiring a fixed amount of XP and is no longer dependant on your season level.**

I managed to reach season level 55. That's 198750 exp and only 37&amp;#37; of level 80. I just couldn't get higher this season. I am a Student and I work two jobs. 

I'd love to play more, but unfortunately I can't and for those under you who reached level 80. I am really happy for you. I know it was a lot of effort that you put into it.  I would just also like to have the possibility to unlock the last tier of that skin, even though I just didn't have the time to play as much as I'd have liked to. 

The changes this season make it possible for me to unlock all tiers of the Ragnarok skin in the future. That gives me a long time goal. People who unlocked level 80 last season will have all their tears a lot earlier than me. This itself has some kinda prestige to it (hard to explain what I mean). 

What I am asking is: Would it please be possible to also add these changes for the skins from last season? I wouldn't even care, if I had to start from 0 exp (but let us keep the tiers we already unlocked pls). I don't want to take away the achievement from the people who already unlocked level 80. You got there way before the majority of the other players. That's a pretty great achievement by itself. I just want a chance for that majority of people, who couldn't unlock them back in season 4, for whatever reason, to also be able to unlock that skin tiers later. ",FortNiteBR

With the meta going the way that it is people are going to rely on smgs more and it’s much more r and g based because of bloom. Why is epic making it so easy to destroy structures now? Because they want to appeal to a casual audience who will just leave them when the next big thing comes along while slapping their real fans in the face. Building is one of the biggest skill gaps in Fortnite and it shouldn’t be so easy to counter. Please buff the shotguns to do more damage, nerf the rockets and c4 s so they do less structural damage, and nerf the smgs to do less damage.

The battle pass system entirely changed how I look at BR now.

The Guided Missile Launcher was the former; it bogged down the pace of the game and felt unfun to fight against. The default SMG (resembling a TEC-9) was the latter, well known for being hot turbo garbo, and removing it paved the way for a split between the Suppressed SMG and the Tactical SMG. The Smoke Grenades just weren't good enough to be worth carrying. The Crossbow, however, was neither extremely overpowered or underpowered, and did not deserve to be vaulted. It had its own niche as a stealth sniper weapon, but was ultimately removed because it was underpowered and underused. The question here is, why not just buff it? It didn't pave the way for more diverse weapons in the sniper category, and it wasn't completely beyond saving. It wasn't even that bad. It did a lot of damage (not quite on par with the Hunting Rifle or the Bolt-Action, but still more than enough to one-shot targets with less than 200 HP) and it could shoot pretty fast. To add insult to injury, various weaker weapons have been left in the game - The Minigun is a fat meme, the Boogie Bomb is the worst grenade currently in the game, the Semi-Auto Rifle is just terrible (and now literally oblosete with the advent of the Thermal Scoped Rifle) and the Revolver... Nobody has ever cared about the Revolver. It is the worst weapon in the entire game and has been since launch. It is even worse than the default SMG was. And yet all of these remain in the game while the Crossbow rots in the Vault. Simply put, vaulting the Crossbow was a bad move, and I (and probably many players) want it back. Please, Epic. It doesn't deserve the Vault.",FortNiteBR

The changes to SMGs were good, and the changes to shotguns were okay, they'd be better if they were more consistent though. In my opinion there were too many gimmicky items and things added during Season 4, Hop Rocks, Dusty Divot was just another obstacle like Loot Lake and Shopping Carts are fun, but they seem like something that would be better suited for a LTM, much like the Jetpack.

I recently just got a new mic set up and have been having issues getting voice chat working with it in game. For reference, I'm using an AT2020 routed through a Presonus USB 96. Although I have push to talk on, I don't believe my mic is working in game.

My mic is currently set to the 2nd input (right channel) in my audio interface (the 1st input has a low-volume continuous beep, problems for later). I'm also aware of how players occasionally have to turn push to talk and/or voice chat off and on again to fix voice chat.

Has anybody had any luck using an XLR mic for in game voice chat? Any tips you might throw out there? I'd prefer not to use Voicemeeter to downmix the source to mono, the software feels pretty janky to me and I'd rather not become too dependent on it.",FortNiteBR

What’s your guys/girl’s reaction to the s5 skins that were shown on the Xbox dashboard. Personally I was hoping for more involving the Bastet mask but hopefully there’s going to be unlockables like the omega skin and that’s not the final form. That aside I’m still excited for what season 5 has to offer. ",FortNiteBR

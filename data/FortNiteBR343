 They talked about Fortnite, talked rude about me for not having a ""battle pass"" loser, and stuff like that. And I just can't say no, She ( Psychologist ) says I am too kind, but depends where. 
My mother says I am Self-flagellating myself cause I just can't do anything about it, and I can't argue or go against my own conscience. Other Post here - ""After some long self depression, I quitted Fortnite. All of my friends in class have already bought Season 3 Battle pass, and Ended it ( John Wick ). Now , from the V-Bucks They have earned, they bought the Season 4 Battle pass. Because I'm Greedy and Depressed lately, I made the decision to quit. I am enjoying the game, but all the Talks in class are about it between them and they are ignoring me 'bout it, even though I know a lot about the game, and I'm the first one which played it. Socially, I feel really bad, and also depressed because of it. I have even got myself a Psychologist, because of Depression and other stuff (I may have OCD, but that's part of me :) ). I haven't bought the Battle passes, because I couldn't buy them ( Parents and Care from them ). Now I'm posting this here, as my first post here, because I need help. Someone to talk with, Who knows about the topic - like u guys - and can give me advice. Pls. I want to be Happy from inside too, not just to put masks on myself..."" After some thinking with myself, and viewing some comments u guys wrote, and knowing that I'm still enjoying the game, I'm thinking about coming back. But here comes the tricky part - well, tricky for me - I don't want to play with them anymore, but Also I don't want to play alone. I'm also got OCD, and am Greedy ( what's my Psychologist says ). I need help and advice on how to be positive in game. I have no Battle passes, unlike them, which makes weird scruple effects on me, and I have no goals in game - Got no Season 3 Battle pass thus no skins - etc. etc. I'm asking, once again, for advice - help, friends, Maybe even talk to leave the thinking about last season and Start a new page, and play with someone"""" 
U guys are really helping, and u know the topic more then my psychologist. I just don't know what to do. PLEASE GUIDE ME :'(",FortNiteBR

He absolutely loves it. He is not the normal 9 year old, squealing and screaming. He is polite and likes to meet up with new friends in Duos. The problem is that he is just not skilled enough at this point to get his first win. I have tried and tried to get him that umbrella but I am below average at best. 

He is so disheartened that he cannot win, so I figured i'd reach out to the fortnite community for help. If you choose to take on this task please understand that he may put a wall in the wrong place sometimes and may miss some shots, but I can tell you he is dedicated and polite. Please do not troll him or this post. If you do not want to do it, just don't reply. He is on Xbox and will be on tomorrow afternoon east coast time. Thank you for your time and good luck out there! Oh and try to taper off them hop rocks. They will kill you. ",FortNiteBR

Squads- 6 rocket max per person= 24 rockets per team.
Duo- 12rockets per person = 24per team.
Solos 18 max per person.
This will do 2 things. In solos it will force you to play smart with them in the end and in other game modes it will slow rocket spam since they have to ask for more rockets so that will give you time to push forward on that team. Reason they are split into 6’s are because of the launcher not RPG. Solos can be a little high in rockets but I think 3 reloads are good for solos as RPG usually builds up and launchers usually rush.",FortNiteBR

It takes no skill to use them and ruins the flow of the game. It doesn't help that one of the only things that's good against someone with hop rocks is a shotgun, and we all now how bugged those are.

This guy runs out to take on 2-3 people like Rambo at the gazebo at pleasant , gets killed, and yells at me that I didn’t come help.  I said, “dude! Tell me as squad leader how am I supposed to help with a pick axe!?”

I was at tree house trying to get any gun I could.

She has realized that since the rise of Fortnite it has had a huge (negative) impact on them, now wants to write a letter to the parents and needs some help.","A bit of context: I have played BR a bit but found it not to really be my type of game, but of course I can't deny the hype it has generated, especially around kids. 

As the title says, she has realized that kids that play the game excessively are pretty jittery and aggressive in class, and that it has an impact that she as the teacher finds concerning.

Obviously, she can't forbid them to play, but she wants to write to the parents advising that it's probably not best for the children if they play that excessively, and she's asked me for help for some points she can tell the parents. I'd like to forward this request to the BR community.

What I could think of:

* It's too much stress for children if they play this competitive game for hours

* Because of the competitive aspect, it can lead to conflict, envy, mobbing etc.

* Even if the FSK is 12, not every kid at this age can cope with the above points, the parents should think about this and talk to their kids

* As old fashioned as that may sound, children that age shouldn't just game all day and maybe go outside or read a book etc.

I would be glad if some of you cold add some points or give feedback to the above points. Thanks in advance!",FortNiteBR

*Pump- It Was Actually Good from you guys to remove Double Pumping, But Single Pump Is Getting worse everyday it goes you guys are destroying the Pump In every single Update, it's Too Slow, And Now all the YouTubers  Pump And Tac Shotgun for this reason.

However we have all agreed that our interest in it is somewhat waning lately.  We've all discussed ad nauseum why and have come up with a list of things Epic needs to do to pull us all the way back in.  Here's what we've come up with, in order of importance...

1.  Our games need to ""count"".  Call it ranked, competitive mode, whatever.  Right now for us, winning doesn't feel nearly as special as it once did.  How does Epic make us feel like this win is ""important"" I don't know, but they need to try.

2.  A new map.  Changing 3% of the map every few weeks just isn't cutting it for us anymore.  We need a 100% new map.

3.  More interesting weapons and items.  I know this won't be popular here because Reddit hated it, but we LOVED the Guided Rocket Launcher for the variety it added to the game.  Sure it was OP in squads but there were so many different ways to use it.  Hopefully Epic has more of these types of weapons coming soon and fewer LMGs.

So what do you got?  Have a handful of things you want to see in the game?  Share and discuss here!",FortNiteBR

We had loads of fun across three generations of consoles; from the playstation to the xbox 360, if a game had co-op, we were playing it. Luckily his dad, and my step-dad, was tech-savvy and into having the most recent tech, so we always got the newest console within a couple months of release. I remember the day he brought the 360 home. It changed everything. We had a gaming computer, and had played a few games online, but it wasn't until this that we were formally introduced to the concept of online gaming. The Halo and Gears of War series' were our biggest go-to's--it was right as he was old enough to start getting good. And we played religiously. Match after match, night after night. Eventually, I moved out due to dumb family reasons, but I bought myself a 360 and we kept it up in separate houses. We formed an incredible bond and had many years of fun together because of it. I remember countless late nights gaming, and the consequential naps in social studies the next day. There were so many bus rides spent anxiously waiting for the slowest bus in the universe to reach my stop, and so many quick runs up the front lawn and into my room to boot up the Xbox. It was a great way to grow up. No matter what awful shit was happening in our lives, we had that. But eventually we did grow up. I moved further away and so did he. I built a badass gaming computer and he bought an Xbox One. And due to our physical distance and lack of shared gaming platforms, that was pretty much it.

We would still talk every now and then, and I'd go see him when I could, but it wasn't really the same. We couldn't hang out and play games for long stretches of time, as we were both working or going to school or otherwise preoccupied and couldn't make the drive. Things just weren't like they used to be. Several years went by and we met less and less. I started saving up for an Xbox One just so I could play games with the guy again, but I didn't have a great paying job, so it was slow going. We drifted apart.

And then a couple months ago Fornite introduced cross-platform play. It didn't take much convincing to get him involved, and then we were off. We play pretty much constantly--any free minute we think we can squeeze a game in, we're playing. The game itself isn't nearly as important as the fact that our platforms are allowed to play together, but it certainly doesn't hurt that it's is fun as hell. I know it sounds kind of silly, but over the past couple of months I've completely reinvigorated a bond with my brother I thought was a thing of the past. I look forward to more games breaking these barriers in the future, and I want to thank Epic for doing it now.

Thanks Epic.
I really appreciate it.

So I'm guessing I'm the minority here, and every streamer/pro I ask encourages double shotgun, and I feel like they're just dead wrong. Now I will say there are a few exceptions as to using it, but noone really focuses on those exceptions, but instead focus on the awesome burst it has. Essentially every 1v1 encounter there should be one thought on your mind. How can I take the least amount of damage from this battle while efficiently killing him. Why that is, is your goal shouldn't be winning this 1v1 it should be winning the game. You gotta look at the bigger picture essentially. Now when you build how are you gonna damage him. You're gonna mainly use your shotgun in a build battle. How good a player is, is how clean they can weave in their damage WHILE keeping highground/pressure up. If 2 decent players verse each other with a decent amount of materials it's IMPOSSIBLE to land your 2nd shotgun. It's honestly even hard to land the first shot if you're versing someone really good. Reason being if you're buildbattling the opponent will wall off you to not get exposed any way possible. They will try to wall any incoming damage, then proceed to outbuild you. And how damage comes through is how many mistakes the opponent makes with his building. And you might say ''If the enemy gets exposed, and messes up his buildings I can kill him quicker with pump-tac so I can continue on with the game quicker.'' Problem with that logic is you should NEVER expect your opponent to be trash. Always except your game has all pros because that is how you improve. If you look at a no skin, and you just bunny hop tactical them, and not build you're not improving. The saying goes ''Just cause it works doesn't mean it's correct''. Simply put just cause you killed the bot with all your shield gone, not a single ramp/wall in sight doesn't mean your good. It takes a shit ton of time to get a pump-tac shot out especially with the slow pump nerf, if a player can't wall BOTH shots after he notices he's exposed,hit,or in danger, he's just not good. The moment you build 1 ramp above a player, and he's preaiming the edge of your wall and just lowground warrioring you with no building bindings set. You can kill him with a pistol at that point cause you have all control of the situation. This goes for rocket launchers and snipers as well. NEVER use rocket launchers or snipers on enemies unless it's to break buildings cause it's the easy way out, and you'll never damage a good player with them cause they'll build out the rocket the moment they hear the shooting sound. Snipers are a little debatable, but overall DON'T use them. 95% of the time you get kills on enemies who stand still spam their ar at your 1 by 1. No good player does that. And the 5% of the time you get the reddit clips which is cool, but you're not improving. You didn't build battle whatsoever you just got lucky with a guy jumping around. As well as snipers make you itch to camp in a 1 by 1 and both parties peeking their head trying to get a nasty *dink*. This is the most RNG shit I've seen when you can erase all RNG if you just rushed him. You should never play like Myth because in pubs you need to improve your rushing skills, and be confident with them. As well as the longer you sit in a 1by1 when it's not even top 5 the more attention you attract, and thats RNG as to who's gonna get backstabbed by the passerby that hears the bullets from over 400m away. OH YEAH and the exceptions to using pump tac are for situations where you're stuck in a 1 by 1 with the enemy(with this you can still outbuild out of a 1by1 IF any of the walls are open. IE jump floor ramp which it is most of the time. And also when you want to quick edit shotgun them. After the slow pump nerf it makes it riskier to do it, but if you want the instant damage you can edit into tac(honestly if you edit to your right peeking angle(on a floor you edit bottom right 1 box and sit on the bottom left box, and then quick right peek shoot). You won't be exposed while waiting for pump to come out.)And the last exception is early game. I'm talking about EARLY game where you haven't broken a single furniture or you didn't have enough time to farm mats and another opponent arises. ",FortNiteBR

I remembered that I had 4 dollars from a fiverr gig that I did, transferred that to my PayPal, which became 3.8$ because of PayPal's cut. So I basically need 6.2 more dollars in my PayPal account to get the battle pass.

Not clear enough? The last time Red Knight was in the shop was a few days AFTER the release of Season 3.

That's pretty clear as it gets, but here's another point that I haven't seen brought up. Sparkle Specialist was a Season 2 Battlepass skin, a part of the ""Fortnite Fever"" Set. Another skin that is also a part of that set, Funk Ops, was just in the store a few weeks ago, well after Season 2.

**disclaimer:** *After alot of google searches, this is what I think the issue is. It could be aim accleration or input lag, I'm not sure. I just want to bring attention to it.*



**My Argument/Issue**

Making microadjustments is pretty much impossible with the current deadzones. We need the option to reduce them. There is no 'slightly' moving your crosshair. The aiming is to tough to correct, because of this, resulting in you over-aiming or under-aiming. Battlefield 1 also had this issue until enough people brought attention to it and they implemented a slider to adjust to your preference.



**Here's a perfect video someone posted on Reddit to show what I'm referring to.**

[Fortnite Stick Dead Zone Issue](https://gfycat.com/angryflakyalaskanhusky)

*This guys example is pretty severe though, but it's essentially the problem. I've tried different tv's and controllers just to see if it is on my end, but there are literally like 50+ posts about this issue on Reddit and on the Epic forums.*




**For anyone who deosn't know what I'm talking about, here's a quick explanation from a Gears of War employee about what stick dead zones and aim accleration are.**

*The inner deadzone is the (circular) small area around the thumbstick that will not register anything. the outer deadzone is the small circular area at the very outer edges of the thumbstick. The reason these options are valuable is because it allows you to choose how responsive your aiming is - this allows for more control.*  

*aim acceleration is how fast your viewmodel (pov) will increase in speed depending on the thumbstick position (it works differently than it does on a pc shooter because a mouse and a thumbstick controller have different mechanics). aim acceleration is how fast that speed increases as you hold the thumbstick still.*



**Conclusion**

Epic doesn't even need to make a competitive playlist they just need to implement custom game servers that allow good players to play tournaments and scrims with each other \- the casual plebs won't even know there are tournaments so their fragile egos don't get hurt.

Fortnite has bee doing the same goddamn thing every patch \- here's a new gun, a new skin, and some bug fixes. No mention of ANYTHING for the non\-scum casual players that play the most.

It's disheartening that NOBODY cares, every time I go on Reddit it's casual posts that sit on the front page because everybody on this game is 12. No joke, as i sit here writing this the top post is entitled "" My friends didn't believe I could pull of the ""double sniper no\-scope double kill""..."" \- Are you fucking kidding me?

This is where the problem lies my friends, nobody on Fortnite Reddit  mentions ANYTHING about competitive Fortnite. Why? Because they're casual trash and enjoy playing this game casually and is there anything wrong with that \- no, but I feel that the more competitive players of Fortnite \- the players that dedicate the most amount of hours to Fortnite are forgotten, buried amongst the filth. 

To end of, I hate you who is reading this, the scum of Fortnite. \- the scum that sits on reddit and makes this game a endless pit of  casual garbage because you want to see some 12 year old hit a ""double sniper no\-scope kill"" rather than develop any kind of competition. 

TLDR;  I hate my life",FortNiteBR

Finally got my app approved by the Apple App store today. Its called “Where We Droppin?” and it randomizes a location for you to drop in Fortnite. The app also includes some info on most of the drop locations. Some locations like the super hero mansion and super villain lair will be added next update. 

Currently, the app is only available to iPhone users. Heres a link…. 

[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/where\-we\-droppin/id1376409973?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/where-we-droppin/id1376409973?mt=8)

If there is anything you’d like to see added to the app let me know. 

Some additions I am considering are…

1. Fortnite server status 
2. List of items currently in the item shop

Enjoy!",FortNiteBR

1. In the Dev Blog they said the loading screens this season will be hints to future seasons, and the first one, “rex” is a fairly famous jurrasic park scene (if you havent seen it yet i linked it)[JURRASIC PARK LOADING SCREEN](https://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F736x%2F6e%2F9d%2F6d%2F6e9d6d203c32c2e58c3edd0e946d1946.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.co.uk%2Fkennethtoysreview%2Ffortnite%2F&amp;docid=FYXLKgpnhvNTOM&amp;tbnid=A3JO2CV4pMvNGM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=698&amp;h=788&amp;hl=en-us&amp;source=sh%2Fx%2Fim)
2. 3 Dinosaur locations with footprints and images of dinosaurs have been found around the map. 
3. There is a helicopter crashed into a tree in moisty mire with film cameras on it and a film set, another nod to a famous Jurrasic Park scene.
4. A meteor killed the dinos and maybe what the superheros have been cooking up in the secret labratorys around the base is similar to jurrasic park.

Is it in the heavy sounding pickaxe category?

 

Regardless, I bought it anyway because I liked how it looked. After I equipped it and hoped into my first solo game with it on, it was not long before I noticed that this thing sounds like a lightsaber when swung. It was at that moment I realized that this was the greatest purchase I have ever made... and I own a house.

 

TL/DR : Let people be able to preview how a pickaxe will sound before buying it. I believe it would put those on the fence people over it when they hear how cool some are. Oh, and.... the Glow Stick pickaxe sounds like a lightsaber!!!!

Before it, you would actually feel yourself getting better in the form of you getting more wins, but now getting better doesn't necessarily result in more wins unless you're at a streamer skill level. Because as you improve, you will be matched with other people who are just as good as you.

What this means is that you lose any feeling of progress in your skills, and this has almost completely killed the enjoyment of BR for me. 

I acknowledge the reasoning behind having skill based matchmaking, but I think that there *needs* to be an actual skill rating that you can see and that you can climb. Using Fortnite Tracker's skill rating is okay, but it doesn't feel very gratifying since it's not an official skill rating and it's definitely not without its flaws in terms of precision.

I just want to addresses some issues at hand in a open discussion, which hopefully Epic will see and address. 

The recent inconsistencies and constantly changing— shooting &amp; building mechanics are becoming an issue. 
I’ve been using the same assault rifles, shotguns, and snipers since I began playing the game. So in my experience, I should understand the mechanics at a deep level. 
However, the constant changes to- First Shot Accuracy, Bullet Spread/Bloom, Damage drop-off, etc... Leaves me feeling like a stranger to these weapons I once knew very well. 

First I want to address the Shotguns and Shotgun Damage. 
The damage inconsistency has ruined up-close battles. Now it seems shotgun battles are more of a jumping around and out maneuvering contest. Which is ridiculous because players have become more cavalier and aggressive with their attacks. 

Once when shotguns were really strong. Players attacked more carefully because a one-pump to the face was one misstep around the corner. Now players are much more aggressive/cavalier because there is more forgiveness with the weak shotgun damage. 
The person that survives a shotgun battle should reflect this in order- Who lands first shot, who was more accurate with their shots, and which person takes less damage by outbuilding or out maneuvering.

EPIC should revert shotguns to what they once were and make it so players cannot equip more than one to their inventory... I know this is not a popular solution but is truly the only solution with keeping the integrity of every shot gun in “TAC” *rolls eyes*

Assault Rifles aren’t extremely bad. 
My negative experiences are more with- bloom and damage drop off. I don’t even shoot at players far away with my assault rifle anymore because it’s not worth it IMO. 
Either I’m going to miss the majority of my shots because of bloom... if not that, then the damage drop off will allow the person to build, reset, and recover.

Sniper Rifles are similar to what they once were. However, I feel it’s harder to land shots now, especially on console. 
When 60 FPS was introduced, Epic decided to start rendering the game differently. That’s why we started seeing bushes and trees popping into view. 
This new way of rendering the game has in turn, made it harder to see far distances. Which has made it more difficult to see enemies and bases that are far away. If I am scoped in and about to snipe a player 200m+ That player’s movement are glitchy and almost unreadable. 
This new way of rendering has also made it difficult to gauge distance. 

This is all the topics I can cover without turning this post into a small novel. I’m interested in seeing what everyone has to say and kindly discuss. 
Hopefully we can bring these issues to EPIC’s attention because they need to be addressed. These issues and hitches need to be EPIC’s number one priority right now!
Thanks for reading

I thought there was a lot of hype for this and PUBG or something but frankly, I'm not seeing it. I've been playing for so many hours now but to be honest it just feels like a waste of time. Normally, I wouldn't mind this if I'd actually been having fun doing it.

So when I first started I was confused on how to choose my character since there is no option then I realize it's random...for whatever reason...

Then I see there's no rewards for being F2P so no point in giving a crap about ranks or levels.

Then after spending hours and hours playing I think I found that Shotguns are OP. I recall having full HP and Shield then some random comes up with a shotgun and 1\-hit's me. Maybe nerf or just take them out of the game because I mean, I get that they're shotguns, they're supposed to be extremely effective in close quarters combat but do you think anyone's gonna find it fun to spend 10 minutes gathering up crap to be 1 shot? I don't. Especially in a game with 1 life.

In fact, I just played a game and gathered up some Legendary stuff then hear someone coming..I sit and wait, spring up then boop. You dead son. Get rekt. Dance on your grave. Prepare your anus. That whole ""Lose accuracy while moving"" thing doesn't even apply to shotguns.

Lastly is the general game and launcher. Why on Earth does it load soooooooooooooo slow and take up soooooooooooooo many resources? Trim it down! There's also no tutorial telling you wtf to do. Got people just derping around here.

One last thing, fire whoever comes up with these skin designs please.

**So yeah, that's the spoiler of what the game boils down to, F2P Newbies. I don't recommend playing.**

You actually don't even have to aim when you do this. Since shotgun range is so close, all you have to do is put your cross hair in the general direction, slap l2 and boom you're locked onto their head. Even if they jump it follows them a lot, but not head level. Going ads actually doesn't take any time at all and the aim assist does everything for you. Conventionally in console shooters you don't ads at close range because it takes a while to go in but in fortnite it's the opposite. Only downside is you can't jump. So during the cool down your shotgun takes to load a bullet, that's when you jump. 

Me on the other hand, trying to copy pc streamers by jumping the entire time. Playing it way harder than it has to be.. Only recently I started abusing this ads thing and I've been going ham. 

Why do you think the best console players play on a high sens with high ads sens as well? That requires literal neurosurgeon precision. They aren't really aiming it's just abusing the game. Ads is supposed to be way slower than hip aiming but these guys use 0.7 and up which is almost the same as not even going ads.. Why? Because they just abuse the game. 

Personally, I understand now why people hate on console. The game shouldn't be played like this and in the long run you don't really get good at the game. Wish I had a good pc..

#What are we doing to prevent spam/duplicate posts/reposts?
 
We currently have 6 different ways we are dealing with these issues:
 
- 1) **AutoModerator:** AutoMod catches a lot of spam posts and and duplicate posts. We put keywords into AutoMod for auto removal which occasionally auto removes a post that shouldn’t be removed, but we believe the benefit of preventing hundreds of posts about “New X thing coming to Fortnite!” outweighs the few mistaken removals. 
 
 Between April 1st and April 30th, the bot performed 46,568 actions including: 28,888 post removals, 15,018 comment removals, and 2,580 post approvals.
 
- 2) **FortniteBot:** Reviews Youtube video posts for basic Promotion Guidelines (auto removes if the user has less than 10 comments total in our subreddit) and approves all text posts and gifs (we still see reports on this as the bot will not re-approve). It does not auto approve images; we manually go through every single image that is posted (this includes memes).
 
 Between April 1st and April 30th, the bot performed 121,319 actions including: 4,679 post removals and 107,191 post approvals.
 
- 3) **FortniteOverlord:** We just implemented the flair requirements a few weeks ago which we have been manually reviewing.  Our newest Bot, FortniteOverlord was in testing over the weekend and periodically during this week which has proven to be quite effective.  It reviews all posts for flairs and will remove those without a flair after 30 mins. This helps users to be able to effectively filter out content they don’t want to see.
 
- 4) **Moderators:** We human Moderators performed 40,131 actions between April 1st and April 30th including: 14,439 post removals (481 a day) and 13,673 post and comment approvals (455 a day). Each of these is manually reviewed by one of the 9 Reddit mods (if you notice more, they are developers or design mods only).
 
- 5) **New accounts:** We have a 72 hour Account age auto removal on posts and comments from from new accounts. This prevents new account spam and spam in general.
 
- 5b) **Karma:** We will be implementing a comment karma requirement for new posts (not including comments). Currently we have no karma requirement to post (though if you have -20 comment karma everything will he auto removed). The current plan to be able to post is set for 50 comment karma.

- 6) **Approved Site List:** We are still maintaining our approve site list to prevent the free vbuck/other malicious sites. We are discussing removing the approve site list since there are a few acceptable links each week that are getting auto removed, but currently the approve site list is still in effect.

#What can you do to help?
 
- Report posts that are breaking the rules! This is the number one thing you can do to help us to see the offending posts/comments and take appropriate action.
- With thousands of posts a day, we can’t see them all. It may take a while for us to see the post, but please keep reporting them! They are a huge help.
- Don't spam Modmail!  We are devoting a lot of time to Modmail spam that a simple report would be more effective.
- Movie Spoilers... We're banning anyone who posts movie spoilers without exception.
- Mega threads: We will be posting mega threads earlier in anticipation of big content launches and regularly updating them.  One issue we've been having is the patches are dropping overnight when most mods are asleep (we have 24 hour coverage but more coverage on normal peak times)
- Faster update to the approved site list, currently we review the sites in mass which can take up to a week

#What else can we as the Moderator team do?
   
- We are looking at upping the post karma requirements. Currently, we believe this might be set too low and an increase to 50 or 100 would help a lot with new account spam. Accounts would be able to comment on posts still (after the 72 wait period), but not post their own.  A lot of larger subreddits have similar limits to help with this.

1) **enabling autorun by default instead of manually.** now if I am in a fort and trying to move slightly up a ramp I will inevitably run right out of it.

Suggestion: please make it a setting that can be disabled.

2) *the new toggle active weapon button is in the way* every damn time I try to swap between weapons and build mode I end up hitting they button. Can you either move it to another part of the screen (maybe closer to the fire button) or get rid of it?

3) *the new build repair button is unnecessary and in the way* just let the player tap on the actual wall they want to repair. A new button taking up screen real estate in a small interface is a bad idea.

4) *we need a way to crouch in build mode* if you are going to do any changes to the interface, could it please just be that instead?

5) *when will we get a stats screen?* it doesn’t need to be fancy. I just want to know how many wins I have.

6) *can you add a load screen reminder suggesting to put the phone in Do Not Disturb mode* 
so many squad games get interrupted by one of the players getting a phone call or text. While this isn’t epic’s fault, it would be great to remind people.

7) * when is voice chat coming?* can you remove it from the settings until it does? It is just confusing being in there right now.

Part if the problem is ranged encounters rarely result in kills, because the second anyone is shot at they put up a wall.

My solution, is that if a wall is shot down, another can't take its place for 5 seconds or so. That way, people don't just wall up until they are close enough to shotgun eachother.

It's not a perfect fix, shotguns also need to be nerfed (and unable to be combo'd)",FortNiteBR

I was talking to a friend this morning about what sports teams exist in the world of Fortnite and we started rattling off team names and that steam rolled into this, what we thought was a, brilliant idea for a series of costumes, emotes, sprays, a location, the build up for the location.  So without further ado;

**The Baseball Season**
*In the weeks leading up to a newly redesigned location, you start to hear ghoulish murmurs around Fatal Fields.  The close you get the clearer they become, if you're standing right on the location where the change will be made it's crystal clear and all it's saying is ""If you build it...""

*Fatal Fields becomes Fatal Field.  A farm house and barn with a corn maze, home made baseball diamond complete with dug outs and concession house, and an unnamed section close by with a sign distinguishing it as Community Pool

*Several skin ideas came up in this conversation including The Spooky Slugger, a reanimated base ball player wearing a dirty pin stripe uniform.  There were 4 teams discussed and a skin for each would be where to go from here The Plankerton Bush Wookies, Junk Junction Rust Lords, Loot Lake Leviathans, and Canny Valley Cupids, they'd sport modern baseball uniforms with mock color schemes based on real world teams.  The last skin idea was for a Loot Lake Leviathan Mascot, which is a foam head version (i.e Tomato Head) of The Leviathan skin that already exists in a baseball uniform.

*Emotes:  The one emote we discussed was having a hologram or even ethereal bat appear in the players hands and they point to ""the fences"" a la Babe Ruth.

*Sprays: I'm sure there are a thousand spray ideas to fill in here as with any topic, but mostly, a ""You're Killin' Me Smalls"" is what I want to see with this set.

It's a tall order, it's a lofty dream.  But some fields are built on dreams.",FortNiteBR

Yes not everyone will get the fully upgraded omega like with the reaper skin last season but if you play enough you will still get it as overall it less cumulative xp compared to last season to get to 80. It might just be me being selfish and wanting to show off in a virtual game that Im pretty good at it but I think adding a few cosmetics locked behind challenges that only good players will unlock will give the average player something to really work towards and get a genuine sense of accomplishment when they get it as currently you can unlocking everything by just clocking loads of hours. They're just my thoughts but I'd like to know how other people feel about having hard cosmetics to unlock.

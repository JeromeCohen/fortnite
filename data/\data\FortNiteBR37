This feature will be good,beacuse if you love certain battle pass,but you haven't purchased it for various reasons,you will be able to purchase it. This will make players like me(who didn't buy battle pass season they started playing) and won't make players who already have battle pass angry beacuse not everyone will be able to have their ""oG sKiNs""(I know they're not OG,but they think it is). In my example i didn't buy neither season 3 nor season 4 battle pass beacuse my pc sucked so i wasn't able to play Fortnite at more than 2fps on lowest settings,so even trying to play was very,very difficult.

Picture this- you load into a game, just like normal. When you enter spawn island, you see a whole tilted towers worth of editing. You think to yourself, ""This must be a scrim!"", but it actually just normal Fortnite. Most of the players have the same skins on- the five real defaults have the hybrid skin, and everyone else is a fake default of soccer skin. You turn right, and notice a soccer skin running around with a glitched pick-axe. Then you realize that he's just switching through his inventory, trying so badly to look good for his stream. When you hop off the battle bus, you head for a location out of way, maybe shifty shafts. However, no less than five soccer skins converge on the very spot that you are landing. When you finally land on a gun, a soccer skin immediately confronts you. He places a wall, and pointlessly proceeds to edit it so fast you have a seizure and eye trauma all at once, and then hits you with a shotgun. Game over. When the camera zooms in on him, you find out that his name was ""TTV\_QuickScopeNinja\_YT"". The usual.

I hope this painted a picture of the current skill gap of Fortnite. The whole game is just stuffed to the brim with greasy 12- year-olds who think that they will be the next Tfue or mongraal. Guess what- you're not :). They all have the same boring names, and the same boring skins. They all wear their stupid little soccer skins with the ""OG"" pickaxe, and think that being able to spaz out on an edit key will somehow make them millions of dollars, and might even bring 5 viewers to their stream. Most of these kids spend at least 3 hours a day just practicing building and editing, which probably means your local school streamers are not doing any homework. If they would just accept that they will never, NEVER be famous on either YouTube or Twitch, and just sit down and accept that they are just like everyone else, then fortnite would be in a much better state.

Now to move on to the endgame. Oh boy. Endgames are in an even worse state than season 5. Every endgame ends with a heal-off. Every endgame ends with spamming the wall key. Every endgame ends with ballers destroying every build in sight. Every endgame ends with the same weapons, the p90 and gold shotgun. Fortnite is losing streams because of this, despite the large amount of new streamers. In 2019, you have to be a ""John Wick"" on steroids to even make it to the top 15.

Mobile is in it's worst state probably since launch. I play on a smaller iPhone, so using 2 fingers is the only option for me. Naturally, I get put up against these 5 year olds who are using ""8 fingers with hand-cam (not click bait!)"", and they instantly build the Tahj Mahal whenever someone is within 100 meters. It has been physically impossible to win on pretty much any iPhone since season 6. It has gotten so bad that I just quit fortnite for about 2 weeks, because I couldn't even land without running into a TTV/YT sweat. And the skill gap. Don't get me started! In about December, YouTubers started to complain about the skill gap. Pro Players were struggling to win a game in public matches. I just thought that it wouldn't affect mobile. Clearly I was wrong. Since I actually value my education, unlike your local wannabe streamer, I only allow myself 1.5 hous to play daily. This is clearly not enough time to improve against the hordes of tfues and ninjas. You can't do ramp rushes. You can't practice building complex structures. You can't practice anything. If Epic Games doesn't do something drastic and extreme to fix the skill gap across the board, then I am afraid that Fortnite will die out, and become a niche game, like STW.

There are people that do want to play either side but the uncertainty creates leavers.

52,lexermatron,1556698679,bjeoov,25,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bjeoov/my_move_from_console_to_pc/,9,My Move from Console to PC,"Recently I invested in a pretty **beasty** gaming PC and made the switch from controller to keyboard and mouse. So I figured I'd share my experience and any observations I've made.

So I have been using my PC for about 2 weeks now having played Fortnite since S1 on Console. I have played about 5000 games and I considered myself a pretty decent controller player. I played with an elite controller and had 4 back buttons which I could use to improve console QoL (editing etc)

**The game is completely different while being the same.**

Obviously I knew the game would play better on the PC but never did I ever imagine that it would be quite so different. At 300 FPS everything really is better. Endgame is completely different and easier without having to deal with constant drops in performance.

**The Lobbies**

The average console lobby doesn't contain as many ""bots"", what I mean by this is anyone can pick up a controller and shoot. I run into far more players on PC that just haven't got a clue. That being said when you do come across people that know what they are doing they are often much better than the average console player. While I know that part of this is because I am not yet completely used to the keyboard etc etc I also noticed this in Arena on console.

**Auto Aim**

Honestly just aim in general is taking some getting used to, people think that mouse is easier (to an extent it is) but things like close quarters fighting and long distance AR shooting are 100x easier on a controller, tapping left trigger while you shoot is like a homing missile compared to this, I do think a controller needs auto aim though. I have decent peripherals (G703 mouse) so its deffo not a hardware thing.

**My builds**

Building is faster full stop. People say with builder pro and the new sensitivity settings on controller that there isn't really any difference, there is. While there will always be people on controllers who will no doubt still always build faster my building was quick on a controller and it is so much faster now + you chuck in how much easier it is to edit and the endgames are a lot easier on PC as a result.

**And binds**

I have spent an awful lot of time in creative playing against friends since making the switch which has helped me to work out my favoured binds for building, what this didn't do is teach me how to loot. Since playing in more lobbies recently I have had to make a few changes in regards to looting and here is how I ended up.

&amp;#x200B;

**Guns** 

Left Alt - slot 1 / AR

Mouse middle click - slot 2 / Shotgun

Mouse scroll up - slot 3 / SMG

C -&gt; slot 4 / Snipe

V - &gt; slot 5 / Heals 

&amp;#x200B;

**Builds**

Front mouse button - Wall

Back mouse button - Ramp

Q - Roof

E - Floor

Tab -Trap

F - Edit

&amp;#x200B;

**Other**

Scroll down - Use

DPI button below mouse wheel - Toggle Axe

Left CTRL - Map

Left Shift - Crouch

G - Invent

Z -&gt; emotes

&amp;#x200B;

**FREE KEYS**

R,

1,2,4,5

68,Patellaport,1556690165,bjds7g,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bjds7g/suggestion_fortnite_classic_mode_limited_build/,2,"Suggestion: Fortnite ""Classic"" Mode (Limited build height, edit timer, classic map/settings)","  

**TLDR:** Fortnite ""Classic"" mode- For those who miss the ""good old days"" of Fortnite. This is a way to take things back to where aim, position, and strategy matter more again and it's not all about building/taking walls and quick edits.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mode settings:**

\- Building height limited to 3 stories

\- 3 second edit timer (one edit every 3 seconds)

\- Change **most** weapons, settings, and the map back to Season 3-4 settings (I miss Moisty Mire and Risky Reels). Keep quality of life changes obviously, and some other new additions.

\- Consolidate/rotate out certain game modes to push players into populating the core modes. The player base is too split right now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Explanation:**

There's obviously a large and extremely vocal part of the community wants the recent patch reverted to include siphon, mats on kills, and health/shield on kills. There is, however, also a large less vocal part of the community that has become burned out on Fortnite due mainly to the extreme skill gap in this game. I've been playing since early season 3, have over 1,000 hours in the game, and will be the first to admit that I can't compete in the current state of the game. Even those who can compete don't want to because it makes it feel like work instead of a fun game (see comments by SypherPK, Ninja, Tfue, etc). No one wants to sit in playground practicing edits for hours just to be able to enjoy the game, no one wants to play scrims where everyone just boxes up and then uses their baller to try to make it to the top 15 or whatever, and no one wants to wait 10+ minutes for games. 

&amp;#x200B;

It sounds like one thing that many players in both of these groups have in common is that we miss the ""good old days"" of Fortnite. People couldn't build well and edits were few and far in between. The game was still about building, but positioning, strategy, and aim seemed to be on more equal footing with building/editing. A Fortnite ""Classic"" mode would take things back to where aim, position, and strategy matter again and it's not all about building, taking walls, and quick edits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, maybe it's a ""noob friendly mode"", but that's kind of the point. This game is at the point where no matter how much someone new practices, 99% of them won't ever be able to compete (including me, who I wouldn't consider a noob/bot, but it sounds like a lot of people would even after over 1,000 hours). 

&amp;#x200B;

I like Fortnite. The game is good. I just don't like playing it right now. As a, lets say, top 25% player In Fortnite if I ran into anyone in the top 5% skill level (probably even more than that) I would have absolutely no chance no matter how good my aim, positioning, weapons are. The skill gap is so large that in a straight up 1v1 I would probably lose 99.9% of the time against a top 5% player. (The 1/1000 game that I do win is because they accidentally kill themselves). And I'm a decent to high skill level gamer with over a thousand hours of experience in this game. The odds of someone in the top 5% being in a random game of 100 players is... 100%. Actually, statistically, 5 of them will be in the game. Effectively making everyone else's chance of winning close to zero unless you get multiple lucky third party situations. In other shooters, etc I can go up against pros and have an actual chance. These other games are still skill based obviously, however the skill gap is smaller and allows for some exciting upsets to occur. Everyone likes a good upset.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of those suggested settings could use some tuning obviously. But something along the lines of a classic mode seems like it would give everyone what they want- new players get a ""safer"" lower skill cap mode. The game would still obviously be skill based, and I bet many streamers/pros would rather play this ""classic"" mode than normal modes. Players who want to practice their edits for hours and then warm up in playground for an hour and then ""play"" Fortnite can go into the normal mode and get their shield/mats on kills, no limits on building/edits, new vehicles, new weapons, other random weird crap, etc. I think a lot of us just want the old Fortnite back though.",FortNiteBR

\-Unlock FOV for ALL DEVICES AND THIS CAN BE DONE EASILY.  
\-Make all other devices other than PC able to drop their settings in order to improve performance. You could make this a 1 tick option that favors having all low settings, far view distance, and no motion blur. Then in return, Console players are now able to play at a higher FOV with these reduced settings to avoid Hitching, Skips, and many other issues they already face from having MAXED OUT SETTINGS on a device BARLEY capable of doing so.  


Also might i add, Siphon needs to exist, and i shouldnt even have to include why. We all know why siphon is good, and if youre against it, you need to learn how to win your 1v1s and not have daddy Epic cater to your plebbiness. If you were gonna take it away from us a week after putting it in the game for casuals anyway, you shouldve NEVER ADDED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.  


I honestly at this point dont care if this post gains traction or not, or if it even gets touched by /u/EpicLoomin or any other Epic employee for that matter. Just know, that if these things were to happen, Myself and probably a lot more people would reinstall your game again, and continue to play it for many many days to come. Keep going down the path your own, and youll be judged in the same regard most of the gaming community has bashed EA for the shady crap they did. Look at em now playing catch up to win back their customers.

&amp;#x200B;

 Is this the fate of Epic Games? The same developer that brought us some of the GREATEST video games of all time? ie Gears of War, Unreal Tournament etc. Id rather not see one of my absolute FAVORITE game developers fall in suit to the rest of these shady video game companies like Activision and EA. Please Epic, start listening to your WHOLE community, and not just little Johnny and his Vbuck purchaser (aka his mother.) Im like actually begging you.",FortNiteBR

In most of the games I played today there was constant blast spam by 2-3 Chitauri in each game to keep other Chitauri from being able to pick up the stones and win.  (I am not talking about the first stone that people fight over to become Thanos, I am talking about every stone after that, including last.)  

Epic also recently added 2 seconds to the stone pick-up time, making the Chitauri wins challenge nearly impossible for many players to complete (thankfully, I have completed it already).

If you are on Chitauri team, please don't blast the teammates who are picking up the stones.  If you are on hero team please consider ignoring stones so that other players can complete their Chitauri wins challenge, you can still fight and kill Chitauri, kill Thanos, have fun, just do the nice thing and let enemy pick up the stones.  The ""get wins as heroes"" challenge starts very soon and then it will be almost impossible for anyone to ever complete the Chitauri wins challenge before this LTM ends.

Stay cool and have fun.",FortNiteBR

In close range engagements, all shotguns should be viable, all shotguns should be an option &amp; the reality is, the second somebody finds a pump, the Tacs are dropped. Make them useful, give them a roll, or remove them and reintroduce the heavy shotguns. The heavy shotguns were a weapon everybody enjoyed, same goes for the pumps currently in the game.

Almost 2 Seasons passed and there's no close range meta changes or additions, I'm seeing the Pump Shotgun dominating every close range fights without exceptions making everything besides this gun a joke, and not even a good one, a bad joke... My problem here isn't the Pump itself being strong or whatever, the real shit here is the lack of options for close combat. At mid range there are some nice options like the Heavy AR, Silenced AR, reg AR, Infantry Rifle, Boom Bow and for long ranges there's enough options: Boom Bow and Heavy Sniper, but for close combat guess what we have...

Yeah, you guessed right, the incredible and insane amount of options:

# P u m p S h o t g u n,  yikes

This isn't fun in a long run like 1/2 hours playing, it's boring af. When this game had Heavy Shotgun, i was switching between both and having a lot of fun with the pace change and reacting differently against my enemies, and when we had Double Barrel was even more fun to play (except when they combined DB + Grappler). Having options and having to deal with enemies with different guns is fun as hell and was what made me waste a lot of time playing this game, having one option only is terrible, even more for a Battle Royale

It is no secret that default/newbies we're receiving the worst end of the stick when it came to the siphon update. it encouraged sweats/try hards to push teams weather it was 1vs4 or worse because there was very little risk. What I mean by that is pretty much, you get a kill and it's like that fight never happened... Full health &amp; matts back.

Now.. i get it.. That sounds great, but what happens when you're a default and it happens to you every... single... game... you can't get more than one or two kills a game... 

I get it... ""Get better kid!"", right?
Wrong.. They'll leave... And hop on the next game, whatever that may be. 

Okay cool.. Now defaults and kids with ""less"" skill are gone but where does that leave the rest of the community, aka the try hards/sweats?

Well.. It leaves us all here... Battling the only people left... other sweats... Now imagine every game... All game... A creative build fight against full teams, sounds fun right?

Not until you realize it isn't.. You start missing the ability to trash on kids, running around and farming in the open or just plain having mindless fun..

Anyways, that's my theory.

Now, please... Stop asking for it back.

Let these guys focus on the bugs/issues we have.. Because there's plenty.",FortNiteBR

I think that other viable tactics would make this game way more fun. Ways to do this is the following:

Make the Tactical Shotgun viable again. It is currently a trash shotgun.

Make the crosshair of the Flint-Knock smaller, thus making this another viable finish off weapon.

It's done by resampling higher frame rates using interpolation of a few frames into one 60Hz frame. First thing that I've though about: it's actually could be done in the game too, providing a loot smoother fast-panning/etc experience. It would not help with faster aiming, because of still really seeing new frame every 1/60sec, not more often, but it would make the game look better (a lot more smoother). I've not thought about suggesting it tho, because I've though that in could be too GPU-heavy to do this resampling ""properly"" to actually provide better viewing experience, not just basically motion blur. Motion blur that would be a lot more CPU/GPU-heavy because of the need of off-screen rendering A LOT more frames.

I'm playing almost only Fortnite currently, from fast-paced games since a long time, I've played some other but ""slower"" games, so I was not aware of competition. But I've tried Destiny 2 yesterday... and looks like they actually doing this, or found some other way of providing ""crazy"" smooth gameplay experience on 60Hz monitors. I've used basically the same rendering settings in both games: Windowed Fullscreen, Unlimited Framerate, 60Hz V-Sync. And Destiny 2 delivers smoothness level of 240Hz resampled to 60Hz during real-time rendering. I have Motion Blur enable in Fortnite, so ""regular"" motion blur is not enough to get that level of smoothness.

If you could actually do it (by resampling, or some other less expensive method, I'm not sure how Destiny 2 is doing this), it would not only benefit Fortnite but many other games using Unreal Engine... so I think that it's worth something to seriously think about.",FortNiteBR

But season 8’s storyline and in game events so far have been very very underwhelming,"The in game events around the storylines have been deeply enjoyable to be a part of snd think about.  They have added such a rich layer to the game that in a way make the island and it’s mystery an ever present and interesting character in every match.  

But season 8 has so far been just a complete disappointment. 

First a volcano shows up with no explanation. It’s just there now.  

Then the excavations take place resulting in what seemed to be leading to something interesting but instead we get VERY weak rune “mysteries” and and even weaker suggestion about accessing a vault. 

Those rune mechanics were just plain boring, uninspired and buggy. Some cool visuals but lacking in any meaning or depth.  They were like the daily challenges of storyline.  Just super pointless and boring. 


And the idea that all of this is about a vault of weapons?   Not furthering the mystery of what it all means or anything? 

It just feels like you have run out of ideas. There was no grand vision.  And now you’re just scraping the bottom of the barrel for what to do next.  

I’ll will say that I am super glad that the loot lake thingy was not captain America’s shield (it’s not right?!) because you would have completely destroyed the story at that point.

Seriously what in the world is wrong with you people? This is a sub for people to talk about the things going on in the game and share their experiences as well as get news out there for other people to know what’s going on. We are in the middle of a huge event but all I see when I scroll through the feed is kids asking for stuff in game like “Can we get the LMG and Homing Launcher instead of the grappler?” Or “Here’s my idea for how to bring siphon back into the game.” Asking for in game content is against the rules of this sub and I’m confused as to why these posts are allowed. I have never seen a more entitled, whiny, bratty group of people than this sub. Epic should have never listened to this sub in the first place. It’s gotten out of hand and I’m so glad they have basically stopped listening. This sub definitely should not have any influence on the game after seeing its community.

You can’t hear anything because the audio got even worse. The rng is at an all time high, it’s farming simulator 2k19 and it’s just simply not fun.

I’m ready for the downvotes although most of you are the ones who cry the most. Anyways I do believe next season is Fortnites last season before it’s true downfall",FortNiteBR

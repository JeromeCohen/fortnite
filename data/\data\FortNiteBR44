Or so you think.

The battle bus suddenly goes back in time to Season 0, and the Zapotron and other weapons you dont remember.

As you fight, the island and the game morph season to season, and you get to experience live events as the battle progresses.

When the battle closes, you’ll be back to Season 8, where you’ll hopefully get a a Victory Royale but definitely rememberance of good times.

This could maybe work out in Squads and Duos as well, but give your feedback! It would be nice!",FortNiteBR

Why?

&amp;#x200B;

Before ballers were introduced, remember how competitive late games where? They were laggy as hell, had tons of stuttering, ghost shots, people stuck in the storm (when they were out of it), and just a bunch of performance issues. These situations were extremely unfair, especially in situations where money was on the line (with Epic's skirmishes and whatnot). 50 people running and building in the last circle, all in a super tight and compact space, are bound to cause performance issues. However, you don't see these issues occur quite as often with the ballers. Why? The server can handle, say, 10 players just rolling and bouncing around in balls and 20 players building in a tight space better than all 30 players building in a tight space. Though the ballers give a huge advantage to those who have them, I think it's better to give some players a disadvantage rather than to give all the players major performance issues.

&amp;#x200B;

But Epic should definitely nerf the ballers, at least.",FortNiteBR

This is one of reasons why the skill gap is so large now.

The funny part is that Epic dont want noobs to be bopped, yet they dont do anything to teach a new player

You must then send the screenshot to this email address: fntreasurehunt@gmail.com, where you will get a reply saying if you are correct. If so, you will be given the next clue. Also, please note there is no prize for the winner as I’m poor, this is mainly for fun, though if you want to add money to a prize pool, feel free to contact me and we can work something out. Now without further ado, here is your first clue, and let the hunt begin!

But what if you want to merge two accounts from the same platform (maybe you have an alt account)? YOU CAN'T.

Also, if you unlink a console from your epic account, you're not allowed to link another account on that console platform. Say you get hacked and you want to unlink your account so you can play your new PS4 account that is not compromised, guess what? YOU CAN'T.

Part one is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b72shq/valeyard6282s_fortnite_theory_season_78/

Part one (Link Above) dives into my theory for Season 1 through Season 6 while this page dives into late Season 6-8 and my predictions for the ninth and tenth seasons. Please read if you are dedicated and enjoy part two of Valeyard6282's Fortnite theory!

On Minerva, while everyone from Royale Island is in the InBetween where time and space work differently, Malcore continues his plan. He needs a general to do his dirty work for him. Malcore forges another man of stone. He creates the Fire King- the Prisoner skin. At this point, the Fire King wears golden armor and has the appearance of the gold Ice King variant. I do belive that the gold Ice King is meant to represent the Fire King before he was imprisoned and shackled. 

Fallen Love Ranger washes up on the shores of Minerva and Raven and Ravage land here too and polymorph back into their humanoid forms. Malcore finds the three of them and enlists them as members of the Council of the Round Table- the court of the Fire King meant to advise him in his path to unleashing the Ouroboros for Malcore. Malcore also enlists Red Knight as a member. Malcore then finds two nomadic hunters hunting native yetis like Trog. This is Jaeger and Fyra. Malcore gives them shadow magic and they become the Shadow King and the Shadow Queen- the red and black Ice King and Ice Queen variants. So Jaeger is the Ice King and Fyra is the Ice Queen- but they haven't gotten there yet. Malcore has Fallen Love Ranger become the Cube King, Raven and Ravage the Arcane King and the Arcane Queen, and Red Knight into the War Queen- with her being granted superhuman strength. 

So the Council of the Round table has five members: The Fire King, The Shadow King, The Arcane King, The War Queen, and the Cube King (Gold Ice King, Red Ice King, Raven, Red Knight, and Fallen Love Ranger).

The other four advise the Fire King within the still-warmed castle that will become Polar Peak. Ark plans to defect one of Malcore's thralls as one of her own. Ark approaches the Shadow King and the Shadow Queen- Jaeger and Fyra- who now have two children, Snowfoot and Snowstrike. Ark kills the Shadow Queen and frames the Fire King for doing it. This sends the Shadow King down a spiral of rage. He prays for guidance, and Ark answers like a guardian angel- even though she killed Shadow King's love and blamed the enemy. Ark offers to resurrect the Shadow Queen from the InBetween if the Shadow King defects and becomes Ark's Ice King. Ark says she'll resurrect his love if he successfully stops the Fire King who ""Killed the Shadow Queen"" and saves her perfect world from Malcore. The Shadow King Jaeger agrees and becomes the blue and black Ice King under Ark's leadership. Note that everything the Ice King does is out of love. 

The Ice King marches into Polar Peak, enraged at the Fire King as Ice King believes that the Fire King killed his love- when in fact Ark did. The Ice King topples the Fire King's seat at the round table and fights the four council members. He bests them all and tears of Fire King's golden armor- reducing him to his stone personage wearing orange rags. He is drug down to the dungeon of the castle and the various torture tools seen in the dungeon are used on the Fire King to tear open his flesh and cause magma to spill out- hence the Prisoner skin's various wounds. The Ice King then cools his magma skin and binds the Fire King in chains forged by Master Key. He is then frozen in a block of ice as he becomes the Ice King's ""Prisoner"". The other three- Raven, Red Knight, and Fallen Love Ranger- are encased in giant frozen statues of themselves. Their prisons are the Frozen Legend Statues south of Polar Peak. They are frozen within giant versions of themselves. The Ice King brings on an ice storm that freezes all of Minerva into a gelid iceberg. He then takes his rightful seat on Polar Peak's throne and puts the Brood Eggs into the dungeon. He freezes the entire castle in a block of ice to supercool the eggs so they can never hatch and put himself into suspended animation- only to awake if the ice melts so he can put an end to the threat and serve Ark loyalty to return his love to him at last.

Every time I kill a player another player hears our fight and is already rushing me because they don't want me to heal. Solos are not fun anymore. I'm being completely honest I've played 2 games today 7 &amp; 9 kills and at the end of every single fight outside of my landing poi I hear somebody gliding over to the high ground next to me... give me a break. I think it's necessary to keep rift to goes &amp; ballers for pro play, but epic needs to take out some of these mobility items. They are hurting new players, there was nothing wrong with hp on kills, new players benefited from it &amp; without it players are just as aggressive. But I'm sure with all the extensive data epic collects they already know that players are still just as aggressive. This is kind of like when they ruined shotguns. 

Shotgun Example: player gets mad that they die, remember shotguns hit a 30, ""MY PUMP DID 30 DAMAGE DUDE!"". Yes that's because you missed your shot. (For those of you who don't know, even though pumps were perfectly fine, they made it so that the pellet spread for pumps was random which completely ruined the pump, then they reverted it back to how it is now after about a week).

Hp on kill Example: player gets mad that they keep getting rushed nonstop because there is too much mobility, remembers hp on kill was just added, ""WT FRICK DUDE THEY ARE ONLY HERE BC OF THAT 5 SECONDS THEY SAVED NOT DRINKING A FULL POT"". No they are there bc there is too much mobility.

Most people want something to blame when they die, there is no problem with that. The problem is when epic listens to those people and drastically changes the game because of it.",FortNiteBR

288,SwiggsTTV,1555738013,bf8w84,115,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bf8w84/lets_fix_fortnite/,2,Let's Fix Fortnite,"I say the week after world cup qualifiers week #2, we go on strike, and we all stop playing pubs/arena fortnite (creative if you must), and have the entire community stop buying cosmetics, until fortnite removes boom bows, ballers, snipers, (all from at least competitive) and remove the rendering change they made in 8.4 so we can have fortnite in a decent enough state to continue playing through the countless bugs. 

&amp;#x200B;

Boom bows:

High damage, explosive, common ammunition type, no damage drop off/arrow drop, and fast reload time, none belong in at least competitive fortnite, maybe pubs if epic insists.

&amp;#x200B;

Ballers:

The only people that like ballers are the lower levels so these should stay in pubs, but have no place in competitive as it allows skill less rotation, no damage taken, and easy late game.

&amp;#x200B;

Snipers:

This is a more controversial one, but many still agree that the weapon is over powered, especially heavy snipers. A weapon that can one shot from distance not only encourages 3rd partying, but allows a less skilled player to win a fight if they are hiding, which doesn't have a place in competitive. Heavy snipers are their own problem, as the ability to one shot buildings doesn't have a place in competitive, yes it is a counter to turtling, but i would rather have flint knocks have one shot ability, as they have longer reload time and don't double as long range poop fests.

&amp;#x200B;

Rendering Change from 8.4:

The main theory to the performance drop in 8.4 is that epic changed rendering so that it unrenders things that are outside of your FOV, which actually boosts frames, but only if you aren't moving greatly, this is used in open world type games and less movement based games. In fortnite though, what happens is due to high movement, the cpu/gpu ends up having to quickly render new objects over and over again, which ends up loosing frames instead of the intended gaining frames.

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, I feel that as a community we need to so some strength to epic, that they are not the only competition. They do not listen, unless we band together. Remember Apex, epic freaked out and started fixing their game quickly, but ever since Apex started going off the map, epic quickly returned to the top and their carelessness towards their player base. For the week we can all play other shooter games (like CS:GO) to keep up skill, but it will get Epic's attention. A Strike against fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

YOU HAVE THOUSAND OF PLAYERS ON COMP SUB AND OTHER SUB RELATED TO FORTNITE THAT ARE COMPLAINING AND POSTING AND ASKING AND RANTING AND JOKING ABOUT THE ON GOING CURRENT FUCKING ISSUES THAT PLAGUE THIS HORSE SHIT OF A GAME RIGHT HERE

24 FUCKING 7..NONE STOP..

GUESS WHY NONE STOP?..

CAUSE YOU DONT EVEN GIVE A SHIT

THERE IS NO FUCKING RESPONSES TO ALL THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE BEEN POSTING ON COMP SUB..

while..

on this sub..aka main sub..

99%..meme content that alot of it is not funny..

and 1 that is some what or actuall matters..wtf..

let me go with a horse shit issues that is plaguing the game right now..

audio:

wtf have you done to it over the past season and right now..

1,ar audible range is fucking terrible and inconsistent..

i have ENDLESS FUCKING AMOUNT OF TIME..where i cant not hear ar shot from within 50 fucking meter because it sound so quiet that it like flip flop shoes hitting the floor

and sometime the volume of ar SFX just inconsistent as fuck..same range..but some time..it loud as heck WTH? other time it was quiet this time it was loud..speaking of inconsistent volume..

foot steps..why does this SFX works like horse shit?..

seriouslly...most of the time i cant not hear a guy that just run up to me from behind...he is RUNNING..NOT..CROUCHING..

and then some time the volume of my own foot steps just get fucking loud like 12 years old mic spammers speaking closely to his own mic..it fucking ridiculous

and directional audio..HOLY HELL WAS IT BAD IN THIS GAME

most of the time i cant not tell the where im getting shot from imediately just by hearing the sound direction

in quake,team fortress 2, or any game""s engine that was either quake engine it self or engine that was modified or based on quake engine..you can hear where the guy is at or where the shot came from completely just by hearing..you dont have to see..you just hear them..and it works almost 100% of the time

in this game it not like that it sound almost like 50/50 on both head phone piece this is especially the case for glider's audio(that you changed in season 6 for no reason even tho the original glider""s audio clearly works)

and that is only just for audio..there is countless issues in this game still(most of them existed for like few seasons)

and NONE..I MEAN FUCKING NONE..WAS DISCUSSED ON THIS SUB..ON A SUB THAT HAVE ABILITY TO FUCKING CHANGE THIS GAME..

you guys should already realized that this sub reddit can change this game just by voice..you have the power to change the game for the better..yet no one whiling to do it and i dont understand why..

let me just give you a example on things that was changed because of this sub..

deagle buff remember? that 1 shot wood and starting metal deagle?..it was idea from this sub reddit(we regret it only untill we see the effect of it has to the game)

siphon removed?..again..this sub reddit ask for it(and it truth)

like the community in this sub reddit here have litteral ability the change the game while other sub getting fucking ignored..yet you dont utilize this ability to change this game into the right direction and resulting in this shitty state of this game..

plz..start posting constructive discussion,critisim, and report on in game issues and not just 24/7 unfunny skin related meme that doesnt matter to the game.

ps:im terribly sorry for my grammer..im from taiwan

and if i have grammer error or spelling error plz tell me",FortNiteBR

Not the 'bots' that pros call because thay aren't actual bots, I mean BOT bots. I can't even begin to count how many times i've died to these people. They are so unpredictable and just do bot things. Earlier I was in a Top 3 situation, the zone was the furthest away from me (typical, right?), a guy who I tagged in front of me for 112 and the third guy who ended up winning the game was to my right on the edge of the storm hiding and crouching under a tree (Yes one of those bots). I knew I had to go to the zone but as soon as I go/build to the zone since it was moving I got beamed by him and died (still crouching btw and slowly moving from the tree to the zone) , he ended up winning Like I said. I honestly can't play against players worse than me because they are so unpredictable and I play and eliminate the so not so idiot players. I hope i'm not the only one who has this issue.

This brings me to the idea of custom cosmetics and I don't mean just build one right in the game. that would defeat the purpose of the item shop. I mean something similar to the steamworkshop. Where creators would be able to make outfits and other cosmetics and submit them for approval or even have the community vote on them. Once these cosmetics are accepted, they would be sold in the item shop and a portion of every purchase would go to the creator of that item. This would create a new community of creators.

I've tried everything I can think of: Watching tutorial videos and pro steamers. Landing in Tilted over and over, landing in safe areas like Lucky. I watch replays of my games to see where I went wrong and where I can improve. But despite all of that, no matter how hard I try, I can never seem to get a win. Just getting a kill feels like a victory for me.

Just in case any of this information is relevant:

\- I've played 960 games and have a 0.45 KD.

\- I only have 2 wins, and even then, I don't feel like they should count. The first was during Fortnitemares, which was a mess, and the second was because of the sword, which was obviously OP.

\- I'm 17 and Fortnite is my second PvP shooter (first was Overwatch) and my first BR game; I grew up mostly playing slow-paced strategy games.

\- I play with Builder Pro, Turbo Build enabled.

\- I play on XB1

\- Sensitivities- 0.61 X, 0.42 Y, 0.515 ADS, 0.42 Scope, 1.64 Building.

I think my three biggest problems are my lack of confidence, my bad aim, and my tunnel-visioning.

 I don't want to get too deep into things, but I've always had issues with self-confidence, self-esteem, and pretty much every other positive ""self-"" you can think of. I've been getting better about managing it in recent years and am in a much better state than I've been in the past, but it still manages to hit me when I don't expect it from time to time. I keep trying to tell myself that I shouldn't beat myself up for being bad since I'm still pretty new to both Shooters and PvP games, and I try to find something I did right in a game to make myself feel less upset. But no matter how much I do this, I eventually get very upset and have to force myself to stop playing just to try and calm myself down.  The competitive part of my brain just seems to take over and berate me over and over again for screwing up.

In terms of aim, It goes hand-in-hand with my inexperience. I know that aim comes with time and practice, and that it's much harder to aim with a controller then on PC.

But I think my tunnel-vision is my biggest problem. I'll try to go into a game to work on a specific aspect that I want to improve on only to have my brain completely flat-line, leading me to ""go through the motions"" without thinking or planning.

 I'm admittedly a very slow learner; I have to do something a million times over before I can even start to get the hang of things. I still have a long way to go before I can even be half as good as many of the people who play this game. It's just so soul-crushing (for lack of less dramatic words) to try so hard at something for so long and seemingly make no ground. 

But the thing about it is: I still want to be good at the game and I still want to keep trying.  Like I already said, I've been playing since the beginning of Season 6, and while I'm still not that good of a player, I have a ton of fond memories. My first kill, my first win, Kevin exploding, using the Sword for the first time, the list goes on. But now, I just don't have those moments anymore. Just frustration, at the game and at myself for still being bad a the game after putting so much time and effort into it. 

I honestly don't know what to do anymore.

Maybe I should just stick to playing single-player games. PvP games just don't seem to be a good fit for me.",FortNiteBR

Looks like some runes have appeared on the map. Let's track them down and work together to move them to loot lake! Damaging them with weapons or pickaxes will lower their HP. Once it hits 0 it moves to a new location.

Use this megathread to keep track of where the runes are on the map and discuss what could they could possibly mean.

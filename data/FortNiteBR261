Instead of having players play against scrubs in random games and using the kill count. This would take away from stream sniping and having friends queue up at the same time to feed kills to a player. Plus it would be fun as hell to watch. All the tournaments I see are just filled with streamers. Where is the 100 million Epic promised to fund tournaments? There should be a solo tournament daily going on.,FortNiteBR

(MESSAGE TO EPIC),"This game is a spamfest and it isn’t fun. There is no skill involved. 90% of the guns i get killed by are drum guns and SMGs, and I try to see what streamers and pro players do to counter this meta so I could replicate it, but even they cant find a way. You guys are being complete dicks and liars to your community by saying that building will still be a pivotal part of Fortnite, but you are slowly but surely driving it to dust. This new SMG could be one of the least fun additions to this game and speed up the death of this game. You will lose a lot of your longtime players, as this game is already becoming somewhat of a meme and while that might push some of them off naturally, this will push them off forcefully.

I cant just complain without a solution, so here is my suggestion: LOWER SMG DAMAGE TO BUILDINGS. This will still leave SMGs as a valuable weapon in combat, but will get rid of those spam fights where you just stand there and shoot through everything the enemy builds. This will also erase the chance of outbuilding an opponent, only to be shot down instantly. If these changes aren’t made, i believe that most of your devoted fanbase that hasn’t’ left due to the memeing of this game including me will leave, and this game will die.

Stupid as hell. Gonna go from taking .5 seconds to kill somebody with an SMG to taking .25 seconds to melt your opponent before they can even retaliate. 

smgs are by far the most overpowered gun in the game, we need LESS not MORE. These guns are way too overused, give us slower firing guns or nerf the hell out of the smgs. 

I used to think double pumping took no skill, that was until I came into this season seeing how OP drum guns and blue smgs were. ",FortNiteBR

Im sure allot of people have been talking about this but here im going to try to tell you why stw is worth it.

The vbuck gains.

When collecting your daily rewards you get vbucks and lama's.

The amount of vbucks is always different sometimes 100,150 and i will get 300 at day 28 myself.

Lama's can be opened and you receive heroes and blue prints from them.

Blueprints and heroes can be used to level up your collection book and you will receive 500 vbucks at level 6,26 and 91, level 26 can be reach within 5hours.

Level 91 is kinda hard when you dont play allot.

daily challanges and other quests. Can also be completed for 50/100 vbucks each.

I've gotten over 3500 vbucks from stw and i spend somewhere between 10/15 hours on the game

Also you get the founders glider in battle royale and the next time you win a game the founders umbrella. 

And there are rumors there will be 2 free skins available for all the stw founders when the game will be  free in the near future.

The current skins people talk about are the warpaint and rose team leader but these are just rumors. ",FortNiteBR

1. Extra delay to pull out the shotgun- 
This is seriously the worst one considering if your going to quick edit pump someone they can kill you first 

2. No double shotgun-
Well I thought the extra delay made double pump fine I didn’t think it was a big deal and when they added the timer for the weapons recently I was asking one question 
Did they buff the damage?

3. No one pump- very controversial but after these nerfs if the pump takes 3 seconds to pull out you hope they are going to pay for getting pumped to the face? No because now this shotgun is honestly bad to pick up. The tac shotgun and the heavy are just so much better at this point and it’s sad epic games ruined the pump shotgun.

So what do you guys think about all the nerfs to the pump ",FortNiteBR

Throughout the match we should have a decreased materials limit. First two cicles you have max amount. Next two it drops to 500 and the remaining are at 250 or something like that. This would make the final few circles more about raw aiming and shooting over who can build the biggest and fastest. It could even encourage some to get to the center and build a fort and hold their ground. Early rounds would still feel the same and middle would even out some.

Currently the pump is completely useless on its own and needs a secondary weapon (an smg now) to do well. It’s role in that can also be filled with a tactical or heavy.

The fortnite summer skirmish only had 100k viewers. Ninja gets more stream views daily. This proves that fortnites comp community isn’t big and fortnite is 70% of casual 9 year olds players who don’t know how to build and watch ninja all day. This is my reasoning and proof why epic is taking fortnite into a no building spamming meta. They keep adding and buffing non skilled spamming guns, like the new smg and tommy gun. There are way to much spamming guns in the game and honestly this game is going to lose its try hard players and it’s going to be filled with casuals.  I do consider myself as a sweat. With a 8.39 kd in solos and around 458 wins with only 4000 matches played. You could say I’m a very skilled and smart builder, but I recently made the switch to rainbow six. I enjoyed the competitive scene for fortnite at the start, I even played scrims. But it seems as epic doesn’t even fully support the competitive scene. And don’t hit me with the “but....but epic is giving $100,000,000 to the esports league of fortnite for the next 2 years.” Fortnites monthly revenue is around $250,000,000+. Epic literally took out 40% of their profit from the month of March and threw it at the pro league. And not even to mention the fact that epic is going to gain around 20% back of their pro league money from events and such. They are taking the game into a bloom based spamming meta. There is no ranked system being implemented into the game, and epic is thinking about adding skill based matchmaking into the game so casual players actually win and stay in the game. Also the fact that fortnites community cares  about in game cosmetics that grant no competing advantage rather than the actually game mechanics is just disgusting. I go into fortnites subreddit is their Twitter and there is no one talking about how broken splodes, c4s, and spamming guns are. Matter of fact all I see is kids begging for stupid seasonal exclusive skins. Also recently the red knight was brought back and I guess everyone knows that soon the Christmas skins and the renegade raider are coming back. The only people begging for the skins are the casual 9 year old player base. With these valid points I stated, I hope you guys can realize fortnite is going to die soon due to epic supporting the casual player base more than anything. Also I don’t know if I mentioned it before, but the pro league isn’t even filled with actual “pros.” It’s literally filled with popular youtubers and streamers. I know countless unknown players who can clap the top players like it’s nothing. I do realize that this is epics first “pro” tournament, and epic said it themselves that the summer skirmish is basically a test for pro league, but if this shit goes on into future fortnite esports events, then fortnite really is going to die due to epic being completely stupid.

185,onyx1985,1532243347,90w31l,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90w31l/cheating/,2,Cheating,"How does Epic games feel about cheating. More to the point, cheating in Fortnite BR.

Under the EULA of their ToS for Fortnite it clearly and explicitly states the following under section 2 and clearly states how they define cheating. 

&gt;2. License Conditions
&gt;(j) behave in a manner which is detrimental to the enjoyment of the Software by other users as intended by Epic, in Epic’s sole judgment, including but not limited to the following – harassment, use of abusive or offensive language, game abandonment, game sabotage, spamming, social engineering, or scamming.

&gt;16.	Definitions
&gt;“Cheats” means programs or other processes which may give players an unfair competitive advantage in the Software.

Now, cheating gives someone a clear advantage over another person in a game. Having accessories (periphial devices clearly aimed at and targeting the market claiming to give a player an advantage I.E. modded controllers, mouse and keyboard on consoles, XIM, ect.) I'm aware ps4 has native support for mouse and keyboard by using it when you're more skillful on pc to gain the advantage is still cheating. It all clearly is a violation of the EULA and the ToS. 

So why does epic allow this? 

I only looked into this because of the huge debate going on with mouse and keyboard players right now and the most recent talk about that one guy who was accused of cheating to win 130k dollars. I read an article on kotaku that he admits to them that he's using a modded controller and I went to the site that was said to be where he got his from and it is plastered everywhere about how it gives you the advantage over other players and more specifically states about how much faster you can build and double pump people (when that *was* still a thing) but the fact remains these things are designed to not be detectable through their anti cheat software and some even fool the console it's on to believe that it's a regular controller. (looking at you XIM)

With all this said it's clear that people are cheating (according to Epics definition) but they don't enforce any of their policies against bypassing cheat detection and gives *SOME* people the advantage over anyone else. Why do game companies ignore this issue and allow it to continue?

Tldr for the lazy: 

People are cheating and epic does nothing against it. They even award cash prizes into the hundreds of thousands of dollars to cheaters as defined in their EULA and ToS.

Personally I think that fortnite is taking a step in the wrong direction and It's appealing to the younger less skilled audience rather than the hardcore community that drop 10+ bombs every game just beacuse people are bad at the game.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suggestions:
-Double pump and or 1 Pump should be brought back~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Nerf SMGS~~~~~~~~~~
-Recoil~~~~~~
-Competitive mode~~~~~~~~~~
I’ll be going in as deep as I can into each one of these topics.~~~~
Double Pump /1 Pump:
Right now there is a huuge disadvantage to using the pump versus using the tactical because you do nearly the same damage, but the tactical shoots 2x faster, so my proposition is that if you are going to have this damage this bad then at least buff a little and bring double pump back or bring the 1 pump back so the pump can be viable in the future.~~~~~~~~~
SMGS:
Alright, so In my opinion smgs and especially the tommy gun and MP5 are wayyy too overpowered compared to the shotguns. The tommy gun has too many bullets and too fast of a firerate to not take it over an AR, same with the MP5, it has too high of a firerate for it’s huge damage there is no reason to have that much damage and do that much to structures AND players, just because you are using a SMG, I personally find that super stupid.~~~~~~
Recoil:
This is going to be short. We all hate bloom and we all have been f****ed from bloom and I personally find that really stupid, because it’s not skill based whatsoever if you are a better player a noob can still kill you because he just got a luckier bloom. The only AR without bloom is the burst, and I don’t like burst at all.~~~~
Competitive Mode
Alright so Competitive mode would be a GREAT addition to fortnite, because the tryhards like me can actually enjoy the game more playing vs good players instead of dropping 10+ kills every game against literally bots.
Competitive mode could be a purchasable gamemode for 500 vbucks and it would have certain rewards for hitting a certain rank:
Bronze 500 VBUCKS (buy competitive again)~~~~
Silver 800 Vbucks~~~~
Gold 1000 Vbucks / Battlepass~~~~
Platnium 1200 Vbucks ~~~~
Diamond 1500 Vbucks + special Pickaxe~~~~
Master 1800 Vbucks + special skin~~~~
Challenger 2000 Vbucks + special back bling and glider~~~~
Competitive rules:
-3x mat gather~~~~
-Higher rank you go smaller resource cap: Bronze 500 on all mats and then +250 for each rank above that~~~~
-When you reach gold rank you get Double Pump, 5 llamas a game~~~~
-When you reach platinum rank you get RECOIL, 7 llamas a game ( if you don’t want to add it for everywhere of course)~~~~
-When you reach diamond+ you get 4x mat gather and 10 llamas a game~~~~
Competitive mode would give an incentive to winning and buying vbucks or the starter pack, so in my opinion it would be a win win situation for Epic and us players that want free skins, an incentive to winning and a better place to tryhard at and meet equally skilled players.

I'm surprised this hasn't been mentioned before. Most games have PTT, and, actually I started off learning how to best utilize PTT through CS:GO, a highly competitive game which uses PTT to communicate. I got really used to using that, and even made a Push To Mute for my discord while I'm in call to help with doing two things at once. However, when I switched over to Fortnite, things did not go all so well (mind you, I've been playing and dealing with this since week 3 of season 3).

I started playing Fortnite and got in calls with friends, while wanting to play with others, and so I would turn on PTT. I load into the game, and hold down my button, and talk, nothing special, nothing wrong (I use Mouse4 for PTT). After this, I go and play, then when I get knocked, and inevitably finished, I go to call comms to my teammate(s) to give information as to where these players are to best assist them in gameplay. Unfortunately, to my bitter surprise, PTT didn't do s***. It straight up doesn't work at all. It frustrates me every time I use it now because I just wanna help my team. What I have to do instead is quickly click through the audio settings and turn my PTT off so I can communicate with my teammates so they don't think I disappeared off the face of the earth. Same thing happens in the endgame. We get the final kills, I go to ask my friend how many they had and such, then it won't work because it has already stopped all movement in the game. It doesn't help that I am quite a talkative guy. Quite upsetting.

TL;DR: I use PTT quite often in games such as this, and whenever you are dead or the game ends you can't use it, and it's very frustrating.

(P.S. Not sure whether to label this as a bug or a discussion, but I'm labeling it as a bug so it hopefully gets fixed. Epic Pls Fix)

Each team has a maximum of 1 king and 1 queen, than knightsmen and lastly the followers (reg players). Killing a king ensures you obtain some benefit. Perhaps stealing a quarter of their followers, taking their buffs and damaging the queen and vice versa for the queen. 

As kings and queens are so valuable they'll have buffs in health, shields and dps etc. Maybe they can teleport short distances too. 

Killing the next class knightsmen will give you slight increases in dps and health overall.

It punishes good gun handlers. If a guy kills me it’s most of the time because he could build a fort faster than me. Yet there’s times you can empty 30 rounds towards a guy wide open and only like 4 or 5 hit??? 

I think this will eventually bite them in the ass, like when CoD comes out, it you point your gun at someone and shoot, the bullet is for sure going to hit them. It’s going to attract people who want real gun fights that are all about skill with gun handling.

Thoughts? Why wouldn’t a recoil system work better than a bloom system? It wouldn’t punish good gun handlers, and builders still would have the advantage by being better builders, but the good in handlers could at least even it up a little bit.",FortNiteBR

Most of the games in this mode are lopsided and hardly anyone revives a team mate. Teams of 20 in contrast has more enemies. And teams are actually more inclined to work together. 50v50 is a big mess. I'm sure not the only one who wants to see it back. The only negative thing about teams of 20 is the final kill which in my opinion should be removed. Other than that this mode is just so much more fun and overall entertaining. The end game usually has at least two or more teams who still have a fighting chance where as in 50v50 it ends at 26v2 which just means less players are involved.,FortNiteBR

You’re literally screwed when there’s grenades underneath you. If you run, probably won’t be able to get but so far before another one blows up the base and then does damage again. 

What’s even more stupid is the fact they can take down a double ramp with walls and floors with a simple left click? How the hell is that fair? If I go through the effort to burn through that many materials for a push, I shouldn’t be easily countered considering that takes skill. 

It’s all just stupid and facing a opponent with a grenade launcher or rpg or any explosives for the most part is a pain in the ass while for them they just sit up on the highground repeatedly tearing me down with minimal effort.

Okay, story time. I stay home, meaning I don't work a normal job. This is because my fiancé has a severe anxiety disorder and can't be left home alone. I do a variety of different things from home to make money for bills, but a few of them have been slow and I haven't been making as much money lately.

I started a print-on-demand clothing brand a while back where half of monthly profits were donated to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) because I'm passionate about everything they do. That did pretty well for a while, but died down. So I was thinking since I play Fortnite so much, maybe I could start streaming and donate half of my monthly donations to ADAA. Is this doable if I work hard to build up an audience?

If so, I'd be streaming from a PS4. Would just the game play and mg commentary be fine, or should I play via PS4 Remote Play, and use OBS to add a view of my webcam to the stream?

Sorry if this is all over the place, I'm just eager to get started because that's the hardest part.

EDIT: How often are payouts made to streamers on Twitch? Also, I only have one laptop, which I'd be using to see the chat. Even though I'd be using remote play, would I still be able to see the gameplay on my TV?

If you are close to your opponent, having a damage indicator is basically like somebody marking their position because theres not so many places they could be. 

Without damage indicators, your target will have to build cover all around. This gives a buff to the stealthy meta (and also scares the shit out of people!)

As i type, the only silenced weapons are the suppressed pistol and the supressed submachine gun. These are thrown away 9/10 times for a normal submachine gun.  

If you think about it to yourself, what does a silencer on guns do if they automatically know where you are as soon as you hit them?

2: you had to get to a certant level to be able to buy it ( level 25 if im not mistaking)
So putting it in the itemshop without needing a certant level really ruins it for ppl that grinded to that level cuz in S1 leveling was way harder then now


But thats just my opinion
If you think it should return after reading this tell me why

Basically binaural audio takes advantage of how the brain/ears work, and by doing so can create 3d audio. 3d audio lets you here where stuff is coming from, how far away, even above or below you. Here is a really good example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IXm6SuUigI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IXm6SuUigI) (USE HEADPHONES)

Now why should binaural audio be in Fortnite? It would help make the game more immersive, help players locate other players (that are close) precisely, and would make the whole Fortnite experience incredible. 

Please Epic, make this a thing! 

Edit: it doesn’t matter what headphones you use as long as it’s stereo (my two dollar headphones I got on a delta flight are stereo, so I think most headphone should be stereo). Also no, it’s the game not supporting binaural and not not having a good headset.",FortNiteBR

Why use an AR long range when you have a sniper?

Why use it medium range when you have drum guns, SMGs, or even a hunting rifle?

Why use it close range when you have shotguns (and obviously SMGs)

I feel like the days of “lasering someone with an AR” are over. I mean why take the chance of maybe tagging someone for 60 damage, when you can simply eliminate them with a SMG without breaking a sweat? 

With all that said ARs are still an all around weapon that can basically work in any situations, but currently, I feel like other guns are overpowering them and basically the only use for it now is putting pressure on the opponent by destroying their walls (which again IMO SMGs and drumguns are more effective). 

To fix this issue, all epic needs to do is just add an accuracy buff, just like they did to many other guns such as SMGs and mini guns, and this will make ARs a more viable option when fighting. What do you guys think?

TL;DR
ARs are getting outclassed by other guns and they need an accuracy buff  ",FortNiteBR

Many streamers are saying how console should not participate as it is too easy for them compared to PC players since they say there is a lot of bad players in console and how some people can potentially use mouse and keyboard in console.

Now, I started playing Fortnite in console, and continue playing it for 6 months before I made the switch to PC. I was top 20 in solo mode leaderboards for at least 2 seasons in console.

I always said how console and PC was the same and always ignored the PC players that said console is easier.

Well, the thing is that it is actually much easier to win in console and get more kills than in PC.

I might get a lot of hate for this post but is true coming from someone that has played half and half the time on PC and console.

Now I'm gonna mention how I play and I'm not saying it to show off or anything, is a video game who cares but im being honest and some people seem to get mad when you ""show off your stats"". Who cares.

In console I would win 1 out of 2 matches most of the time, this was months after I started playing until I became good and I noticed how incredibly easy was to win as there was not many good players.

In PC i win probably 1 out of 3-4 solo games, and I face good players WAY more than I have faced in console.

Now I personally think that the money should be split, and console players go against console players, and PC players compete against PC players.

Same in showdown tournaments, you can see many of the top finishers play on console.

TL;DR: Is easier to win and get kills in console compared to PC. This is being said from someone that has played both.

For many people, the crossbow seemed useless because it did not deal a fair amount of damage but for others, it was handy for determining another player's location from far away using the scope. The crossbow dealt a good amount of damage if it hit in the head, but other than that it is not even close to being overpowered. I think the only problem there might have been with the crossbow is unlimited ammo, which can be annoying if you are a target. This can be easily fixed, and the max ammo that the crossbow should hold is 100-250.



With the addition of playground as a permanent gamemode coming soon, I personally think many people can find a use for the crossbow, whether it is practicing snipes, or testing range. Crossbows were useful to many people, and were handy when you didn't have a sniper. I think it would make a good addition to the game, what do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90q2bn/summer_skirmish_week_2_friday_winner/?st=JJVRSYLM&amp;sh=bed14dc3

Regardless of the outcome, it’s alarming to see that “accessibility” is more important than fairness of play.  The quote that directly indicates this is “we do not restrict input device for players on our platforms in an effort to promote accessibility for our entire platform”.

The question I pose here is, do you find it problematic that mouse and keyboard users (on console) are being paired with controller use?  Also, what does this say about Android and Nintendo Switch input advantages?

**Edit:  Should we be prepared for an influx of PC players on PS4?  Switch? Etc.?

All of my friends are busy right now and when they wont be I’ll be busy so I decided to go into a squad game as a solo and I thought I’d just hide until I was sure I was in the top 12 and I’d kill myself. 

I jump and land near the container yard place and to my surprise no one else was there so I loot a little bit and get no shield but I got bandages, materials, an SMG and a green AR. I then leave and go to hide in a shed just on the edge of the storm ring. While I wait there I scroll through Reddit and read interesting posts on the fortnite battle royale subreddit. The storm comes and I need to run a marathon to get to the zone and there was 46 people left so I wasnt top 12 yet. So I proceed to the center of the circle and I hide in a bush and I go back to Reddit. 

This time I kind of forget that the storm is even a thing and I spent so long that when I look up next I’m near the end of the game with 12 people left and still in the zone. So I sit back and watch these people fight and before I knew it there was this one guy versus a squad of three right in front of me. Thats not fair! A one v three? So I threw these clingers and grenades at this trio as they desperately try to kill this bob the builder wannabe on too of a nearby mountain and I knock down one of them and critically damage another. Bob the builder pulls out a damn sniper rifle and shoots the guy I downed right in front of my face and then downs the critically wounded guy. At this point Im scared because the guy I downed noticed me and sent his last BOI to get me. I spray this white SMG like it’s the start of season 4 and I just got my first spray and by the grace of Tomato Town Tomatohead, I kill this guy. 

Oh shit, it’s me versus Bob the Builder and I have 54 health. I pick up some mini shields and a grenade launcher and just as I finish off drinking my sorrows away to 25 shield I hear Bob building his ramps up to me. I freak out and Bob pulls out this pump shotgun and misses his first shot. At this point I knew I had ten years before he could fire off another shot of a pump shotgun so I spam this grenade launcher not even knowing fully where this guy is and I get that all important slow-mo moment and I had done it. I killed Bob the Builder and won when all I wanted was to get top 12. 

TL:DR 
I hid the entire game to get in the top 12, killed someone in the final two squads, took his grenade launcher and spammed my way to a win. ",FortNiteBR

Not the worst. Fine with that. Let me also say I have been really enjoying season 5 so far, despite having some complaints. 

Considering myself an ""og"" without skull trooper ($20 for a skin is dumb even if I can afford it) I really gravitated towards the battle pass when it was introduced. $10 for numerous items and challenges. Great! 

Got Black Knight... Felt accomplished.
Got John Wick... right on I need more.
Got level 80 Omega... pretty cool.

The second I saw season 5 rewards, I didn't feel that tingly ""I'm ready to grind"" sensation. My first reaction was ""they are intentionally holding back to get us to purchase skins released during the season"" 

I don't like that. 

Now to relate all this to the post title...

Since the change has been made to make skin upgrades unlock by XP it has taken all motivation to grind out of this season. ESPECIALLY since they can be earned AFTER the season is over now!  

ON TOP OF THAT... you give someone with more money than brains the ability to purchase all tiers from day one. Leaving one thing left to do... grind XP. You're left with the current state of lobbies (full of these trench coat 100k+ Drift skins running around on WEEK 2!!!!) 

Not only is that not fun its a slap to real players who grind without wanting to break the bank. 

At the end of the day IT'S A BUSINESS...I GET THAT, but if we're constantly praising Epic for being about their community... I'm surprised we let this one fly.

I understand in games like R6 Siege, because it's not supported and you need an adapter to effectively ""trick"" the console into thinking your keyboard is a controller. That's cheating. You are forcefully using an unsupported device that is not allowed by the developer, which gives more precision than what is allowed. For some reason, their community has the opposite problem, with a lot of players thinking that kbm is perfectly OK on console, despite it not being supported, and the devs officially categorizing use of adapters for kbm as cheating.

Fortnite is different. This game has kbm support BUILT IN on consoles as an official, supported input method by Epic Games themselves. Why should people using an officially supported method be punished, or seen as ""cheaters""? In what other game could a new player pick up playing with official setup, practice and learn the game, decide they want to compete because they are pretty good, and then be arbitrarily told they need to switch to inferior controls giving them less precision over their game for seemingly no reason just to compete? It's as ridiculous as telling football players to stop wearing cleats because they give them too much precision on the field. It makes no sense, it greatly lowers the skill ceiling, and makes watching the sport as a spectator less exciting as a direct result. This last part is the reason why there are so few successful streamers who use controller, nickmercs being the exception here. If you want to see the craziest and highest skill gameplay, you don't watch people with controllers, because why would you? They aren't as good, and therefore less fun to watch.

If you want to be the best at something, you need the best gear. That's how it has always worked in every sport, and in every game, and that's how it always will work. When Epic decided to support kbm on consoles in the first place they made a huge, difficult decision, knowing that it would be decisive. But right now it seems like both Epic and it's community are in this weird limbo where they don't know whether or not to stick with this choice or not. I'm personally on the side that thinks it was a good choice, but I think the team at Epic need to make a final decision on this, and either allow kbm on console in tournaments, or disable it altogether from anyone playing the game on console, even casually. It shouldn't be allowed in casual games but not in tournaments, or vice versa. There needs to be a continuity there so as not to be misleading.

What do you think Reddit? Am I missing something here, or am I just really biased because I'm a PC player?",FortNiteBR

Auto aim in itself is a joke but come on the skill ceiling on console is not as high as PC.. You can argue all you want but the simple fact is you have far more control over a mouse then a controller. 


""Furthermore, we do not restrict input device for players on our platforms in an effort to promote accessibility for our entire audience."" The pro's have already lost if this is Epic decision - Pro scene will always take any advantage (which is their right to, big money is on the line) It would be stupid at this point not to play kb+m on console for future tournys.


Console players are overall less skilled in comparison to the pc version. I'm NOT SAYING console users are not skilled, i'm saying out of say 100% of each player base only maybe 30% are controller capable compared to 70% M+KB on PC. (These stats are obviously fake but it's not rocket science watching over console / pc version of the game and comparing the general level of players, in a pub stomping format, this literally puts the pc players at a disadvantage.

Does Fortnite not have enough players to seperate console and pc players when hosting competitive events?",FortNiteBR
490,tstols,1532194341,90qz39,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90qz39/no_skins/,0,"""No Skins""","This isn't a meme, it's a genuine post.

About a year ago, when Fortnite Battle Royale was just starting, you would get a skin randomized and given to you in each game you were in. There was a blue, yellow, red, green skin, and a few others. When Fortnite decided to allow custom skins to be sold, the other random skins disappeared. The green skin became the ""default/no-skin"" for players who didn't buy skins. 

It's not a bad concept, make your character's appearance cooler with these new skins, however, the downside is that they cost real-world money. 

I know what you're saying; ""NO, THEY'RE PURCHASED BY V-BUCKS"" but at the start, you could only buy V-Bucks. The new Battle Pass and Free Levelling up system (I'm not even going to call it a stupid free pass at this point. It doesn't get you anything unless you play like non-stop) allowed you to get V-Bucks for free, but for the free players, they could only obtain 200 V-Bucks per season with VIGOROUS grinding. 

Nothing was wrong at first, people bought skins, and others didn't. As time passed, more people began to pay, now mainly for the Battle Pass which offered more V Bucks and special skins/emotes.

As more time passed, there was a bit of a divide between the players who paid for stuff, and others who didn't. People started calling the Free Players, those who decided they didn't want to make in game purchases, ""No Skins"" or ""Default skins"". Nothing wrong with this, it essentially became the version of Roblox's ""NOOB"" or Rainbow Six Siege's ""RECRUIT"". 

It would be fun for people to change outfits to default skins and then go have some fun as well, so they look like noobs, but are actually more skilled.

However, as more free players got better, and still decided not even to spend $5 on the special starter pack, they got better at the game, and people would make videos saying ""the defaults are learning oh no"" or meme vids like that.

To be honest, it's just kind of annoying. Sure, it's a good joke, but to really talk shit about people who just don't pay for extra content on Fortnite? I mean, it's kind of confusing. 

Sure, the cheapest skins cost 500 V-Bucks, but there are only a few good skins of these, AND it takes over 100 days to get this amount for free. 

I don't have to suffer the ""no skin fate"", as I'm on PS4, the system that hates XBOX and Nintendo with a passion and says ""fuck you"" to cross-platform-play, and PS4 Plus members get special Fortnite bundles which included 2 skins, a glider and back bling. 

However, I think it's just kind of interesting and mind boggling how Fortnite's creators made it so that not paying money for extra visual content for a FREE game mode would automatically make people noobs.

Just an interesting observation.  And now, I wish to ask you a question or two. (I will answer them first too)

1. What are your thoughts on no skins?
2. How much money have you spent on V Bucks in Fortnite BR? (If you are comfortable saying so)
3. If the answer to 2 was yes, what things did you get with the V-Bucks?
4. Do you think the purchase was worth it?

My answers:

1. that they are noobs, unless I know them personally
2. $0.00
3. n/a, didn't spend any
4. n/a, didn't spend any

He had plently of time to plan for the tournament. guy just buys 130 no skin accounts from very different time periods. Buys 10$ bp on some.s  
Hires 10-20 guys to use vpns or something to change their ip every game. they all go through the accounts, switching account + Ip everytime he kills them. They confirmed none of the  player he killed were the same gamertag, but what about the other players in the lobby. If one of his goons got caught by another legit player maybe they would reuse the account next time until it got killed. They need to check all the players in the lobbies. At this point if he paid everyone 1k + money for accounts he would habe spent 20-30k. Keeps ~100k for himself. I dont know if epic understands how xim works but they obviously dont give a fuk. I guess its up to microsoft + sony to clap down on this. Somehow. I inderstand its very hard if not impossible for the system to tell the difference but someone needs to enforce stronger rules.

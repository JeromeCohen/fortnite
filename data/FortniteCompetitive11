How do I convince her that 4 hours on the computer isn’t bad?","Info about me: I’m a 9th grader at the top of his class with A’s in every class. I go to guitar lessons in my free time as well. I am trying to become a professional gamer.


Today, I had an argument with my mom. You know, the typical one where she says that I’m addicted to video gaming and that. I practice Fortnite on weekdays for about 4-5 hours. On weekends, since I have all the time I would ever want, I play for about 8 hours a day. I am very motivated and want to get better and better. However, my mom thinks I’m addicted and, no joke, does that thing where if I’m complaining about my back hurting or something, she says “It’s because of that damn computer” or something like that.

Today, we had an argument in the car, where she said I better cut down my screen time. I said this is unreasonable since I have amazing grades and am fairly mentally stable. And then I said I’m really passionate about competitive gaming, and that I am trying to see if I can pursue it as a career. She basically laughed in my face as to her, video games are a disease, do nothing good for you, and professional gamers are slobs who live in their mom’s basements. 

So I try to convince her, tell her how successful pro gamers are, but she pulls the “you are successful in school and you are not letting that go to waste”

She makes me watch those Dr. Phil videos and 2020 shows about how video games are basically satan all the time. I try to tell her how ridiculous they are, but no, it never works.

I don’t know where to go from here boys. Help me please.",FortniteCompetitive

Yesterday I got into champs league because I really want to improve. I was proud, but all the comments about it being an absolute joke to all of you ""gods"" stayed in the back of my mind. Was curious what it would be like.

My first two games I had 40 (FORTY) people in the endgame moving circle. I'm not super educated on storm progression so I'm not sure which circle that is. Regardless, I felt like I was in the most competitive game of fortnite I had ever played. 

The games continued like this for hours. Never did I see senseless playing, sociopathic moves, none of it. Everyone was locked in and making the right decision to keep themselves alive. 

All I could think about was everything I read from this sub about champions league, and that couldn't be further from the truth. How its so easy, not even an accomplishment, etc. 

I get it, you guys are very polished at this game. Sometimes I think I am too and maybe I could compete with you guys. But ill never be more than a filthy casual. However, I have improved at this game more than any gme I have ever played, **for fun**. I just wish there was more respect given to the level that literally all of us compete at. With so many people playing this game, we saw a populace get experienced so fast, faster than we have ever seen with a video game. This is all uncharted territory.

## What’s New?

We’ve heard your feedback about Fortnite Competitive and the Arena playlist, and decided to make some major changes to both. We’ve heard your complaints about audio and FOV. With this update, we will also be boosting our communication with players even further in the coming weeks - stay tuned!

# Battle Royale 

# Weapons + Items

* Baller
   * We‘ve heard your concerns about the Baller and have decided to remove it from Arena. The Baller will still be in all normal playlists.
* Stink Bombs
   * Turtling has been a proven issue in late-game Arena matches, and the Stink Bomb has been a counter to that to an extent. Unfortunately, there is no easy counter to Stink Bombs either. Stink Bombs will still be in  normal playlists.
* Rocket Launcher, Grenade Launcher, Clingers, and Dynamite
   * Explosive weapons are powerful! These items have been vaulted from Arena due to how incredibly strong they are to builds. These items might make a return to competitive in the near future, in a nerfed state. All explosive items will still be in normal playlists.

# Gameplay

**Bug Fixes and Improvements**

* Trap placement bug has been fixed
* Turbobuild delay has been fixed
* Fixed phasing through builds while turbobuilding
* Multiple other minor/major bugs have been fixed
* Improved servers internationally 
   * This will help decrease lag and ping
   * Less connection issues
* Infinite Dab emote duration increased from 14 hours to 2000 hours

**Field of View**

* Added a Field of View slider to all platforms
* Field of View changes are allowed in the Arena playlist

**Audio and VSE**

* Adjusted the audio heavily so that players can hear where opponents are shooting/coming from. 
* Visualize Sound Effects has been fixed to allow players to accurately see where players are shooting/coming from. This includes up and down directions.
   * Visualize Sound Effects option has been turned on by default for all players
   * Added a transparency slider so it doesn’t get in the way as much

**Console**

* Added new visual options
   * Added the option to turn off Shadows
   * Added the option to edit View Distance
   * Added option to turn off Effects
   * Added multiple other minor options
* Added the option to opt-out of computer/mobile lobbies for Arena modes

**Mobile** 

* Added the option to opt-out of computer/console lobbies for Arena modes",FortniteCompetitive

 Im Electriko, a spanish professional Fortnite Coach, and this is my second post.  


Here you have the first one, if you want to learn about ballers and percentages:   [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/be8ww5/spawn\_rates\_for\_spots\_with\_3\_4\_and\_5\_ballers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/be8ww5/spawn_rates_for_spots_with_3_4_and_5_ballers/)   


  
Today I bring you a Heatmap for World Cup (for solo). It represents the turnaout each place of Fortnite map has in landing.  


Each colour represents how many people lands in that place as average in each game. The number is the exact value.   


For example: in Tilted Tower the value is 5,7. That means, as average, it will be 5,7 players landing there. Some games will be 15, some games will be 0, but as average thats the value.  


  
I did this infographics with a sample of +60 games, in World Cup Solo, weeks 1 and 3. If you have some questions I will answer them all. I hope this will be usefull for every player that wants to chose a landing or make routes. Thank you !

It's either the hitbox for the item(?) or the rate at which they can be picked up. For example, a weapon and its ammo, for some reason, are added into the inventory at a slightly slower speed? Sometimes I'll be walking into the pair (while spamming the 'pickup' button out of habit) and only one of them will be picked up? IDK if this is just me, or if anyone else has experienced this. Let me know!  


EDIT: This is unrelated to that one issue where merely walking up to a chest or vending machine will sometimes result in the 'pickup' action being used, even though the 'pickup' button isn't being used. Cheers!",FortniteCompetitive

Asia itself is a huge region (Biggest Continent) But we only have two servers which are both favoured to the west. Due to Fortnite's automated server system we get randomly matched b/w the two servers, Server A(60 ping) and server B(190+ ping).
This random selection of servers result in some matches of 60 ping and some being of 190 ping which we have to leave because it's UNPLAYABLE. Yes, we LEAVE EVERY OTHER MATCH and it sucks.
😥
This server issue also resulted in all of the competitive matches/In game tournaments Being UNPLAYABLE (190+ ping). It really sucks that we can't compete in any tourney, not even Arenas. The east Asian region is full of players that want to prove themselves and have a chance to compete against the best but we can't.

Epic Game's Devs can easily fix this issue by giving players ability to choose b/w the two servers so we can play the game normally and not have to leave every other game.. And also give us a chance to compete.

You aren’t getting the true endgame competitive experience, as everyone starts to W Key as soon as they hit champ. 

My simple solution is to reward Vbucks (maybe 50 per win in champ league only), more VBucks the higher hype you achieve, and also a small amount of VBucks in the tournaments for those who don’t place in the top 500. 

Why is this a good idea?

1. It incentivizes players to be on their a-game at all times. Giving Ranked mode the only attribute that it needs, deep competition. Notice that ALL the pros are playing custom scrims to prepare for worlds, because ranked mode is literally a joke at the moment. 

2. No money is directly coming out of epic’s pocket for giving VBucks. I would even argue that the increased engagement from players would result in a revenue increase. 

3. Makes the 5-15 minute queues and overall grind worth it. Right now, playing in ranked only serves the purpose of having shield/mats per kill and qualifying for tournaments. D6 should not have more people in final circles than D7 in my opinion.

Bouncers are super unbalanced; you can carry as many as you want, build up as high as you want without repercussions all while not even taking up an inv slot.

But if epic decides to add these items, I thought of some balancing they could do when they do implement them into arena.

Infinity blade; already nerfed, could maybe use some damage nerf

Planes; a fuel meter and I believe you could be set because of the nerfs just before they got vaulted

Drum Gun; damage nerf and maybe a longer reload time

Grappler; less ‘uses’ in one grappler

Bouncers; limited amount that you can carry and let it take up an inventory slot to make it a compromise to carry, like it should be in a BR

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping to have discussions with fellow console players about; how they are doing in the WC,  who has placed the highest as of yet, drop spots, game performance etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Boring life stuff** 

So. I am a PS4 player ;( and  I have massive aspirations of one day competing at a reasonably high level in Fortnite. However, with little financial backing and commitments to paying rent, car and food i can't buy myself a gaming PC at this very moment. However with hard work and a sh\*t tonne of grinding i am hoping that i may be able to make some money off one of the competitive Fortnite events on console, and as a result, put this money towards a PC and my fortnite / gaming aspirations.

&amp;#x200B;

**Playing WC on Console**

Moving on from my own life situation... I would like to talk about how i have been doing. For me the WC qualifiers have been up and down. My problem is that my biggest strength is my game sense and i can score high points by making it to end game, i can pop off in the later moving zones, but as we know, on console end game isn't the smoothest... I am stuck between playing aggro at the start and trying to gain points whilst my console can still run the game. Or sticking to what i'm good at and playing end game and hoping i just some how pop off on 10 FPS.

&amp;#x200B;

**Drop Spots on Console?**

My drop spot, if i am playing to end game, is Haunted hills. I typically land on the castle and try pick off chip shots (L2 Spam TF) on people still gliding down to other POI like junk junction, pleasant and Haunted's graveyard. Then i will carry on looting castle to max brick, before sliding down to Haunted's Graveyard if it is uncontested. From here i will usually finish looting Haunted, max out my materials and move towards the two houses to the East where i will get one of the quads and rotate into the zone. This works 60-70% of the time to help me survive early game. 

From here I find mid-game frustrating and unbelievably difficult to perform consistent in. Mid game is like the lottery, you either get nice easy rotations, or Psychopaths pushing you repeatedly, willing to waste all of their stink grenades and mats and anything as long as they kill you. 

If i am playing for kills, because early game is when my console runs best, i usually just hot drop the first place the bus goes across, and this is sometimes successful, however i think hot dropping is massively 'RNG' based, and this tilts me ha ha; sometimes i just drop on 3 grey pistols... and maybe an infantry rifle..

&amp;#x200B;

**Your experience?**

I am interested to know if any other console players have had any success in the world cup thus far? if so;

Where have you been dropping?

have you been playing for late game or being aggro early game?

How has you console performed?

What has been your best placement in the qualifiers yet?

Most players might not face this problem but a lot of them do. When you have such high ping the game becomes very slow and cant be played properly or how its supposed to be play, for example when you play in Arena Div.6 you might face issues with competing like I do, You get shot through your builds, your walls get replaced easily, end game becomes so laggy and so on.

I just want to know if there's any way in playing this game with such high ping? Like i cant play it Competitively, it becomes Impossible, if i try playing Arena i get killed easily not cause im bad, its just cause of my ping. Like I want to get to 300+ pts to just play in the WC Qualifiers but i just can't. I really want to take this game seriously but i just honestly can't, and with this lag i just dont feel like playing the game anymore. Keep dying to dumb things and it just pisses me off.

&amp;#x200B;

This issue can be solved easily but i feel like Epic Games don't bother trying. Like i live in the Middle East area and i think if theres servers there it'll make everything easier for Millions of people.

Players should take advantage of weaker lobbies at the beginning of tournaments rather than inevitable waste a game at the end of the tournament.


#Many players are not finishing all 10 World cup qualifying matches

During last Sunday's NA-East World Cup qualifier, there were 2915 players who queued up in at least one match; however, only 2424 (83%) finished all 10. Some of this can be explained by delayed starts, rage quitting when it was clear a top 6 finish was not happening, or staying in the lobby for extended periods of time while you wait for that guy you met one time at a LAN to finish his match so you can queue up at the same time.

Perhaps the most interesting reason, however, is that players were running out of time.

It’s been discussed before, but it is worth restating that it is mathematically impossible to play optimal Fortnite and queue all 10 games. Across 279 matches that occurred during the 3-hour window last Sunday, the average game length was just under 24 minutes. The shortest was around 22.5 minutes and the longest was 24.5 minutes. If you played perfectly and won every match, you would only have time to complete 7 matches and queue up for an 8th before 180 minutes elapsed. While no one is expected to play perfect or win 7 matches, a quick look at past leaderboards indicates top players are not completing all their matches. Only 77% (156/200) finished all 10 of their matches among the top 200 players. 


#An overview of the current meta for game management

A popular meta for solos game management seems to be to play your matches as normal for the first 150 minutes and then evaluate how to proceed for the last 30 minutes. If there is not enough time to queue for all remaining matches, the player will play ""throwaway games"" where they land at Tilted, attempt to get a few kills before dying, and then return to the lobby to get into a new match. From an outside perspective, this seems overly conservative in a setting where only the very top of the leaderboard qualifies. Is there a more optimal way to manage games?

As a statistician, I find this to be a really interesting game theory question. After several days of thinking about it, I finally decided to look into the data and perform a few analyses. I found some of my findings interesting and wanted to share with others who likely share a similar interest.


#Fortnite Analytics

The first figure I generated [IMGUR link] (https://imgur.com/a/nySlcPx) illustrates the estimated probability of experiencing a “time crunch” based on your final rank. This ‘time crunch’ metric was defined as having 2 or more non-started games with less than 25 minutes left. Under this scenario, it would be nearly impossible to play the entirety of one match and still manage to queue in time for another match. Among players that finished in the top 200, 56% had not yet begun their 9th match with less than 25 minutes remaining. 

The second figure I generated [IMGUR link] (https://imgur.com/a/Uh5Lu0y) was a series of histograms to show the distribution of elimination times in each match for the top 500 overall players. Three things jump out:
(1) There was a bimodal distribution in most matches where players tend to be eliminated near the beginning of the match or near the end.
(2) The distributions were noticeably different in Games 8 and 9 as more players were eliminated early.
(3) A player’s last match was typically their most sweaty.

Next, I calculated the expected number of points for players under a time crunch versus those that were not. Among players in the top 500 after 8 matches, the average point totals for games 9 and 10 was 0.6 higher for non-time crunch players (mean=4.5; sd=4.8) compared to time crunch players: (mean=3.9; sd=4.1). While this difference was not statistically significant, it does suggest that players not under a time crunch scored more points in their last few games.

The final figure [IMGUR LINK] (https://imgur.com/a/UjRNnBc) I generated was a scatter plot of the timing of starting a match versus a player’s ranking. Each dot represents a unique player-match. The dots were colored red to denote games where a player scored 15+ points. I also estimated (using a non-parametric loess smoother) the average player ranking at all time points in the 3-hour window; these estimates were indicated by the dark green line.

The quality of players in a game increased substantially as one gets nearer to the end of the 3-hour window. However, there was a slight bump that corresponds to the first 15 minutes or so when players were eliminated from their first match and queue up for a second match.


#Interpretation

Here are my takeaways;
1.) If you anticipate finishing in the top 200 or higher, it is more likely than not that you will have 2+ games remaining but only enough time to fully complete one.

2.) On average, players with more than 25 minutes remaining when they start game 9 scored more points in games 9/10 than players who start Game 9 with less than 25 minutes remaining. 

3.) Player lobbies in games 9 and 10 are difficult. When you decide to ‘throw away’ game 8 or 9, you are likely going against similarly talented players. It is unlikely that you will score many points with this strategy.

4.) Players not under a time crunch are able to take advantage of other players ‘throwing away’ a game by playing the game out in lobbies with fewer players left for end game. This increases the probability for placement points.

5.) Lobbies at the beginning of the 3-hour window are considerably weaker. These games provide some of the best opportunities for high score games that may be needed for qualification. See my previous post for a nifty visualization of point distributions [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bj9d54/week_3_nae_point_distribution_by_match_visualized/).


#Aggression Game(s)

Taking all of this into consideration, I think elite players whose goal is World Cup qualification should consider implementing what I refer to as “aggression games” in their earlier games. 

In an aggression game, a player plays more aggressive (but not reckless) in seeking game advantages (e.g., kills against likely weaker opponents or contested loot/ballers/etc.). In addition to elimination points, this strategy theoretically would provide additional loot, health, and mobility that may lead to greater opportunities in end game. If successfully implemented over several early games, this could snowball into multiple opportunities for additional points. If the aggression game is unsuccessful, the most likely consequence (assuming you are an elite player that expects to finish near the top 200), is the loss of a 1-2 point throwaway game.


#Final thoughts

Having said all of this, I acknowledge Fortnite is not played in a vacuum. There may be downsides to aggression games that are difficult to measure, including a lack of comfort with aggressive play style, lack of momentum, or concern about losing a safety net. Furthermore, numerous talented players have qualified the last few weeks even though they did complete all of their games.  Still, I would encourage players to evaluate their current risk tolerance regarding game management and consider implementing a slightly more aggressive approach.

The monitor is big and since I have a small desk, it sits about 2 feet away. This wasn't a problem when I had the res, as I had a smaller monitor. Now when they said they would only allow 16:9 I was hopeful since they said that they would put an field of view slider into the game. I tried playing the game and decided to wait till they added the slider because I was getting headaches and dizzy. I don't want to stop playing this game but I think I might have to for my own sake.

I have severe motion sickness on everything. I cannot be in a car for longer than like 1-2 hours before feeling sick much less be in a plane or a boat. I do have the tendency to become motion sick pretty easily. This is some backstory first: I recently got my new pc and setup (i7-9700k, RTX 2070, 144hz 27 inch monitor), before I used to play on my dads laptop (i5-????, gtx 1050 ti, 60hz 15.6 inch panel) on there I really started getting into fortnite (started getting pretty good too). The only issue was I kept feeling very nauseous when I played for like 30 minutes or more. My mother recommended I take the same pills I take when we are traveling to counter motion sickness, these worked well but still after 4 hours I started feeling pretty sick. At this time I shrugged it off as maybe just my dad's laptop is too small or something. A few weeks later I finally got my new pc and setup but the same issue occurred at this point I kept using the pills to play this game then I saw a few streamers using stretched and decided to switch and one day we had no pills left and I decided to play anyway, what do you know stretched actually helped and I never had to take a pill since then... until they removed stretched and now the game is unplayable for me. I really love this game and don't mind removing siphon or ballers or even the weekly updates (like them hehe) just really NEED the fov slider. I don't want to risk the potential side effects of these pills just to play a video game without almost throwing up. Please, Epic I really love your game just cannot play it.

* Battle Royale with 80-100 players
* Skill based matchmaking that take into account player k/d, player win percentage, and perhaps other factors
* Players can play in a creative/free play mode while they wait for a matched game (similar to Overwatch), in these free play modes, bots will spawn for additional aiming practice etc. 
* Building mechanics
* Editing mechanics
* A fast farming rate for building materials (balanced of course, nothing too high)
* A map with multiple POIs capable of retaining a larger player count (i.e. a ""tilted towers"" for each corner of the map or something to that effect that spreads players throughout the map a bit more equally)
* A separate playlist for casual and ranked players
   * Ranked mode offers a competitive loot pool with a guaranteed drop rate of weapons of uncommon rarity or above, guaranteed weapon spawns instead of spawns that are only ammo, 100% chest spawn rate, and limited to no explosives (no rocket launchers, gl's etc.). Playing in ranked mode offers cosmetics rewards in each division and also allows players to qualify for cash tournaments that are hosted weekly. Performance in these cups then contribute to the ability to participate in a World Cup. 
   * Ranked mode tier system works similar to the ranked mode in [Rocket League](https://rocketleague.fandom.com/wiki/Competitive)
   * Multiple game modes in the ranked system that include traditional BR, 1v1 cage matches limiting players to a random POI, and some fun ones like racing or something. 
   * Gun attachments that are available throughout the map that increase base stats of weapons significantly but not to an extreme degree, each gun is limited to 1 or 2 attachments max. 
* 1st or 3rd person gunplay with recoil
* Dynamic shrinking zones that do damage to players outside the zone
* Sniper glint on players scoped in with snipers
* Mobility is limited to a set of vehicles and players using those vehicles are susceptible to damage
   * Items like a launch pad are also viable as mobility
* The player's glider can redeploy if jumping from certain heights, but the players is only able to glide, they will not be able to skydive, their movement while gliding is 10-15% slower than when gliding into the game at the start. 
* Each gun or item has a dedicated counter
* The game has a dedicated test server. Content creators, competitive players, and casual players can be invited to play on this server to test an upcoming patch and provide feedback before a patch goes live

So in loo of an actual competitive mode why on earth don’t they test items in pubs before implementing.
I come from Dota which hs a very successful and mostly balanced Comp Scene. 
New heroes and Items are always made available in pubs so they can be tested for balance before being thrown into Comp. many other games operate the same way.

Why is epic trying to reinvent the wheel here. Yet again there appears to be another broken item implemented into a comp two days before World Cup Qualifiers....


It is obvious they don’t truly care about competitive integrity or the community but I think having items tested in pubs is the smallest possible ask. They can keep putting out their shitty weekly content and the casuals will still have new items, just not at the direct detriment to comp. Maybe if we make more noise on this front we won’t be subjected to a whole new meta a day before qualifiers again.

Paladins buggy as hell and unbalanced, bugs fixed before any content goes out good devs. Devs get creators and comp players to help make a bridge of communication between playerbase and devs. Paladins devs good, Epic could learn something from them.

A while ago, HiRez, the creators of paladins, smite and realm royale split into 3 teams and
this was the beginning of something great. 
           The new company and developer of Paladins, Evil Mojo, implemented a project called “The Hunt” and it’s main goal is to gather info on bugs and fix them asap before content goes through. It’s been around 6 months now and over 100 bugs of importance (such as not being able to jump or use a certain ability) have been fixed.
           Recently a new project has started called “Assembly of Champions” or AoC. They gathered a group of content creators and competitive players and started consulting them asking them about balance and potential changes. Nothing goes through without their approval now. They have meetings before every update and Paladins has become such a better and more enjoyable game now.
Here’s a video a member of AoC made about this: https://youtu.be/A8DQQGGGjOE
For some context, Lian is an op champion who could overpower all the other champions in her category and will receive a nerf because of AoC and the player base having people to represent them in the form of comp players a content creators.

Conclusion:
Epic has to make an AoC of their own and CONSULT creators and wc players before they do shit. Tfue, Chap, Poach, Vivid, Tom, Benjy, Savage, Mongraal, etc. They also need to stop releasing so much content and start fixing the game. This would make them less money but morally it would be the better thing to do. It’s a fucking video game. It’s supposed to be fun...",FortniteCompetitive

**120ms** on **World** **Cup** is horrible, you're saying to try to actually have a chance to compete we must fly to **Japan/Korea** just to get the low ping. You have a chance to get into the Finals for the World Cup Qualifiers but after that it's just impossible, because **90**% of everybody else is playing at 60 ping and below which is unfair.

&amp;#x200B;

I have emailed an **EPIC GAMES** employee and they said they will for sure have SEA servers for competitive when the game **"" FULLY RELEASES ""** like when will that be? When the game **DIES**? Many people in S**outh East Asia, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, etc** have **stopped playing the game** as they know that they **don't have a future in Competitive Fortnite whilst playing at this ping.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Several possible reasons EPIC doesn't want to add SEA SERVERS for COMPETITIVE:**

\- Spending extra money more servers reducing their **PROFITS**. You already have servers in Singapore why not utilize that?

\- **""Not enough player to fill up lobbies.""** I find this not true as **many players from India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and much more other countries play on South East Asia servers** so you're telling me we can't fill servers/lobbies?

\- Not much people **SPENDING** on **COSMETICS** in South East Asia? That's almost not possible because **80** of the players of a **99 Player lobby** is equipped with skins like 99% of the time.

\- They just don't give a **DAMN** about **SEA**.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why we SOUTH EAST ASIA players need SEA servers for COMPETITIVE?**

\- We need an **EVEN** playing field to play on, which we don't have to worry of high ping.

\- We can play on low ping which enables us to play on our **FULLEST CAPABILITIES.**

\- **Allows new players to be brought into the spotlight**, emerging young players talent are able to get out of the shadows and display themselves at their best performance.

\- **Expands** the **esports scene of Fortnite**, and the esports scene overall.

&amp;#x200B;

**HOPEFULLY, YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND MY CONCERNS.**

Hopefully, my time writing this hasn't gone to waste. UPVOTE this please even if you're not in SEA so SEA PLAYERS can get noticed. If not we must suffer and try to compete at 120ms and get laggy builds, players phasing and replacing our walls faster because of ping, our bullets won't register quick enough killing us even if we shoot enemies quicker.

Honestly the most frustrating thing about the whole ‘revert’ and now ‘stretched res’ is the fact that they do not respond, justify reasoning for such drastic and dumbfounded changes 1 week before the World Cup even begins. The fact that the **NEVER** listen to the community and the fact they throw every relevant comment under the bus is absurd. They never seem to realise that you can’t abandon the community as we are the ones that bring life to this game in the first place. Even with 95%+ of the casual and comp community wanting to revert back to 50 health/shield on kill and yet they still are BLATANTLY NEGLECTING THE WHOLE COMMUNITY is an absolute Joke to me. They CONTINUE to ignore our cries and is honestly disgusting and vile.

 I absolutely know that no epic employee will read this, however this is just my way to express my feelings on epic as a competitive player as I feel as if they do not give a single shit about us.

Another thing that continues and will keep continuing to absolutely baffle me is the fact that in one week; the **BIGGEST** esport event in fucking history starts in less than 10 whole days and the fact that they are not doing anything to cater to the competitive community astonishes me.

Epic NEED TO GET THERE PRIORITIES STRAIGHT. This is directed at you epic: speaking on behalf of the whole community, Please Please Please think. Think before you act. Think and test before you bring another sword, or quad launcher, or planes. Think, use you fucking brain. If you change half the map, it mean half the players are left without a landing spot. Leaving them to be in despair ‘out of the money’. Think of how many ‘casual’ players use stretched and how many ‘competitive’ players do, why in your right mind would you give the people who don’t even use stretched the ability to use stretched and the people who do use stretched not the ability to use stretched. Your company is a joke and I think everyone knows this by now.

I was wondering if you could using a mouse bind remap to have your mouse button up as a keybind for confirm edit. So in theory all you would need to do is press your edit key once to select the edit, click your mb1 down to make the edit, and once you’re finished making the edit you release  your mb1 and it confirms the edit. Because your mb1 release is remapped to a letter key on your keyboard that you only have bound to your confirm edit and nothing else. 

I’m not home right now but when I get home I’m going to do some testing. So to summarize I’m going to remap my mouse button 1 release to say the letter ‘k’ a bind on my keyboard that I don’t use in fortnite. I’m going to then set ‘k’ as confirm edit. And using a remapping bind everytime I release my mb1 it will input K thus confirming an edit. This is the exact same concept of using two individual binds, but eliminating the physical movement of clicking a second bind. 

Now everytime you click your mb1 whether that be to heal, or build, or shoot technically the ‘k’ input will be going off everytime. But it doesn’t matter because k only inputs a command that does something if you’re in the edit screen. 

Lemme know your guy’s thoughts. Also if this is ban able or anything like that, that’s fine I only want to hear arguments on why it wouldn’t work. Not that it’s against the rules if it is.",FortniteCompetitive

You can do so yourself by viewing their games through [Fortnite](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bjerij/psa_you_can_watch_all_the_qualifier_games_through/). My conclusion is that while most of these streamers excel at 1v1s, they fail quite badly in the 40-50 player endgame scrims where positioning and game sense is paramount.

&amp;#x200B;

Solo pubs are essentially a rolling series of 1v1s. Any above average player can stomp their way to victory by picking on the weakest players and working through the field. Superior gun skills and build competencies will virtually guarantee a win when going up against less confident players. In this sense, solo pubs are not true battle royales because you hardly ever get a multiparty fight situation. At most you get 2 guys engaged in a 1v1 and a third party jumps in to try and get some easy pickings.

&amp;#x200B;

In competition, it becomes a lot harder to pick up these 1v1 kills which is why we end up with the 40-50 player endgame scrims. You do not have a chance to get any placement points unless you can survive to the 5th moving circle. The key to survival is mobility, positioning and timing. Once you are reasonably safe, you can then opportunistically start to pick off other players as they desperately try to rotate.

&amp;#x200B;

What I have noticed is that many of the streamers are not consistently making it to the top 25. They are actually getting most of their points from early game 1v1 kills and then getting eliminated in the end game because they were in a bad position in the 4th circle and got picked off as they tried to rotate to safety. In this sense, many of the people who made a name for themselves in pubs actually ended up doing very badly when the game became a true battle royale.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not picking on anyone or even on the streamers as a group. Many of them are clearly distressed by their poor performance in the World Cup qualifiers and actually choose to hide their identities in competitive play even when they are not streaming. If you follow the link above you will see that some of these people actually toggle the streamer mode on and off during competition which kind of hides them but you can probably figure out where they are in the replay if you put some effort into it. I am genuinely interested in understanding what is happening mostly because I want to improve my own game play. Because I am a lot older than most of you, Fortnite to me is not about being mechanically gifted but having the good sense to be in the right place at the right time. It is about tactics and having the right instincts. Reviewing other people's game play is about honing my instincts. Inviting you to tell me I am wrong is also about improving my instincts and it might actually improve yous.",FortniteCompetitive

I have severe motion sickness on everything. I cannot be in a car for longer than like 1-2 hours before feeling sick much less be in a plane or a boat. I do have the tendency to become motion sick pretty easily. This is some backstory first: I recently got my new pc and setup (i7-9700k, RTX 2070, 144hz 27 inch monitor), before I used to play on my dads laptop (i5-????, gtx 1050 ti, 60hz 15.6 inch panel) on there I really started getting into fortnite (started getting pretty good too). The only issue was I kept feeling very nauseous when I played for like 30 minutes or more. My mother recommended I take the same pills I take when we are traveling to counter motion sickness, these worked well but still after 4 hours I started feeling pretty sick. At this time I shrugged it off as maybe just my dad's laptop is too small or something. A few weeks later I finally got my new pc and setup but the same issue occurred at this point I kept using the pills to play this game then I saw a few streamers using stretched and decided to switch and one day we had no pills left and I decided to play anyway, what do you know stretched actually helped and I never had to take a pill since then... until  they removed stretched and now the game is unplayable for me. I really love this game and don't mind removing siphon or ballers or even the weekly updates (like them hehe) just really NEED the fov slider. I don't want to risk the potential side effects of these pills just to play a video game without almost throwing up. Please, Epic I really love your game just cannot play it.

* Stinks do 4 hp &amp; 1 shield instead or/&amp; where the stink is thrown it spreads that direction, giving more time to react
* Code what makes sure there's always a different item in x radius, example : 1 story of a building. Could be a rough task to pull off but it would only be a positive edition
* Explosive bow should make a whistling sound while travelling + slower arrow speed, enough for it to be more of a calculated shot, giving it a higher skill gap or/&amp; projectile drop making the velocity &amp; distance tracker disappear after a certain distance

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

These ideas don't particularly have to be added to normal modes however in my opinion it would be a pretty positive change.

Rng would be reduced although it would still be an element, however it would be a compromise in my opinion epic would be all for.

A competitive loot pool would be nice however I think they've made their minds up.

Reconsidering is always an option devs :))

If they allow a slider, those players who sit further away from their screens and might get motion sickness at a higher FOV will then be at a disadvantage when playing against others with higher FOV. I'm assuming EPIC may have discussed how a large percentage of their player base are console players, specifically those who play the game more casually. A smaller percentage of their base play on monitors and are more likely to play the game more seriously. Their ""compromise"" is to restrict players' FOV to 80 so that the biggest part of their player base isn't playing at a disadvantage. As is tradition, Epic is catering to their more casual base, and will not make changes to give more serious players more advantages. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't agree with their approach at all, I think a slider is totally fair as truly competitive players will play at a higher FOV and those who just want to have fun probably won't care or even try and change their settings at all. However, for those wondering why they decided on this compromise and didn't provide much reasoning for it, this might be one of the major reasons.",FortniteCompetitive

Dan or whoever from epic that might read this, you can do all kinds of mental gymnastics to explain these changes but the reality is that your choices do not make any sense. 

Why don't we make the game force a certain colourblind option because theres a group of people that don't see some colours? Why don't we force all epic settings because there are streamers that want to play on epic settings but its a disadvantage? Yes, you wouldn't do that, because that wouldn't make sense now would it?

When siphon was removed from pubs, the whole community went outrageous and we all wanted an explanation... but Epic didn't give us one for weeks. We trashed epic for not communicating with their playerbase and pulled evidence about countless times how they ignored certain situations. HOWEVER, when we finally got an explanation, it wasn't the one we wanted. It didn't change our attitudes towards Epic and we still trashed them. Now, I'm definitely not basing my argument around the 100+ hours work days, but I am arguing that when Epic puts a statement out about not changing something again, they stick to it. Believe me, I didn't want stretched to be taken out (1440x1080 boys where you at) and obviously I wanted an fov slider coming from games like Overwatch and COD. In reality, I think the truth of the matter is that no matter what we say at this point, we just have to adapt. Tfue said it on stream the other day, you get comfortable with the best to be the best, and right now, 80 FOV is what we get. Be happy Epic had the balls to release a statement and believe me when I say they knew we were gonna lash right back out at them. Planes sucked, they didnt change them. Ballers suck and they're still in the game. Let's all just try to move on and be the best fortnite players out there. We're the competitive players and we want to win. If other players can win with this meta and these settings, then what's to say that we can't too?

Is this accurate?  If so, i am very confused by how you came to this decision?  It literally, and i hate to use ""literally"", makes zero sense as an argument.  You are saying that no one gets motion sickness on a FOV of 80 and the only thing that could cause motion sickness would be to increase the FOV.  What?

&amp;#x200B;

I am not affected by motion sickness, thank god.  However, i have a coworker who can not play first person shooters because he gets motion sickness.  I asked him if he was able to play third person games and he said yes that is fine for some reason it has to deal with first person shooters.  By limiting the FOV you are making your game closer to a first person shooter.  Wouldn't this affect people like my coworker negatively?  As you decrease the FOV he (and anyone like him) would be more prone to experiencing motion sickness.  

&amp;#x200B;

The point i am trying to make here is that people can get motion sickness from any FOV.  Therefore, the only way to solve the problem for everyone would be to implement a slider.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically Epic, and fuck do i hate using ""basically"", you are full of shit.  You desperately came up with a ridiculous reason why the FOV is to be locked at 80 and there will be no implementation of a FOV slider.  Own it Epic, you know you are full of shit, you know your reasoning behind not adding it is full of shit so just come out and fucking say it.  Why do you feel the need to constantly lie to your player base whether it be casual or competitive.  There is obviously another reason why you do not want to implement this feature which is a pretty basic thing in any modern third or first person game.  

&amp;#x200B;

Listen, we know that the competitive side of this game is purely marketing to promote the game itself.  Fine, i can live with that, fuck, i am not even a serious competitive player.  However, at the bare fucking minimum you could at least be fucking honest with the god damn community.  Tell the god damn truth why you dont want to allow a FOV Slider.  I, as well as everyone else, knows damn fucking well its not because locking it down causes less motion sickness.  For fucks sake that does not even make sense.  If you really gave a flying fuck about motion sickness you would actually include the god damn thing so that every single fucking person had the ability to combat was causes THEIR motion sickness.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic, i am fairly sure you had a brainstorming meeting to come up with reasons you could use to justify your decision here knowing that the majority of these justifications are fucking lies.  For example,

 

* *Minimizing jarring transitions when aiming down sights.*
* *Minimizing potential motion-sickness in players further away from their screen. The further a player’s head moves from the center of the in-game field of view, the more negative the reaction.*
*  V*aried engagement ranges, favoring a low FOV and thus a closer view of enemies.* 
*  *Performance.* 

You know damn well every one of those is a fucking lie.  Jarring transitions?  Wouldn't that be the trade off for someone who wants to increase their FOV?  How the fuck does that affect anyone else?  Motion sickness i have already hit on pretty hard.  What a load of crap.  Varied engagement ranges?  What does this even mean?  How does this affect anyone else?  The trade off of increasing the FOV is having further distances distorted.  That would be a disadvantage that would only affect the person willing to deal with that disadvantage.  Performance?  I am pretty sure its well fucking documented that stretched resolution actually increases performance.

Many people have completely failed to read what they wrote in an unbiased manner.

People keep harping on their motion sickness argument, when that wasn't even their primary point on the default FoV of 80. They chose FoV of 80 to balance between 5 different factors. Their factor on motion sickness was basically directed at people playing on consoles from their couch ""Minimizing potential motion-sickness in players further away from their screen."" 

&gt;The current default FOV of 80 is a tradeoff to accommodate:  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Varied engagement ranges, favoring a low FOV and thus a closer view of enemies.  
&gt;  
&gt;2. Minimizing potential motion-sickness in players further away from their screen. The further a player’s head moves from the center of the in-game field of view, the more negative the reaction.  
&gt;  
&gt;3. Minimizing jarring transitions when aiming down sights.  
&gt;  
&gt;4. Visual fidelity.  
&gt;  
&gt;5. Performance.

Once gain, not just motion sickness, five different factors were part of their decision making process.

They also clearly stated why they removed the customization of FoV under the stretched resolution.  

&gt;When a game introduces a feature that provides a gameplay advantage, players gravitate towards turning it on to maximize their chances of success, even if this makes the game look and/or feel worse. The stretched characters and distorted views detract from Fortnite as an entertainment experience for all. ""

Maybe they shouldn't have boxed everyone into ""all."" But they are right, a high % of big players/streamers were moving to stretched, including Ninja. Epic doesn't people watching a distorted version of their game, they want their game presented in a certain way. They saw the potential outcome that everyone would be playing stretch and they did not want their game to be presented like that to viewers.

Now as a spectator/viewer, I don't enjoy watching stretched. That my personal choice, but I imagine casual fans would feel similar. No one on this sub or even the main sub are ""casuals"" in my eyes. In my eye, a casual is someone that just hops on a few games a week, doesn't follow patch notes, and updates. Casual can be someone that doesn't even play Fortnite, but might become interested in the WC event. Epic certainly wants them exposed to the game in a certain way.

The competitive community has not lost faith yet, but if we go into a new season that is plagued with all the problems we’ve been facing recently, the competitive playerbase’s morale WILL take a huge hit. You guys have all the feedback you could ever need, and we all just want what’s best for the game. With your help, Fortnite could come back stronger than ever: with a thriving competitive scene, and casual modes that are exciting and fun for players of all skill levels. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.",FortniteCompetitive

I've been playing on console since around 2006 so I am very comfortable on a controller over a kb/m. I probably would have been fine on kb/m but controller just feels so natural to me.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was attempting to make the switch I used scroll edit reset so when I went back to playing on a controller, I wanted to try and find a way to best replicate it. I play claw and use my right hand middle finger to press down R1/R2 and when I am doing a 3 layer ramp rush etc, I tend to press R1 first and then quickly slide my finger down to R2. I thought that I could use this in the same way to edit/reset my builds quicker.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been messing around with my keybinds and this is what I have came up with:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Edit - L1
2. Select - L2
3. Reset - R1
4. Confirm - R2

&amp;#x200B;

This means that I've had to change the following binds:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Cone - L1 &gt; Square
2. Reload/Interact - Square &gt; L3
3. Previous weapon - L1 &gt; Square (I was originally going to use triangle because I thought it would feel most natural because of how many years I have played COD but it made it more difficult to slide from R1 &gt; R2.

&amp;#x200B;

At first it felt super weird to change my cone bind but after a while I got used to it. For some reason I wasn't super comfortable pressing L1 to place cones and square seems to be a better fit for me.

&amp;#x200B;

So how do I edit quicker and reset builds quicker?

1. Faster edits - Press L1 with my index finger and quickly slide it down to L2 to select tiles for editing and then press R2 to confirm
2. (Almost) instant resets - Press L1 and then press R1 with your middle finger and quickly slide down to R2

&amp;#x200B;

Pros

* Faster edits (seems faster to me anyways)
* Reset builds quicker/easier
* Edit/Select/Confirm/Reset all close to each other on the controller (I used to use L3 to edit, R3 to reset and Circle to confirm. I got really used to it but I hit a wall and couldn't edit/reset how fast I wanted to)

&amp;#x200B;

Cons

* Need to sacrifice cone bind
* Harder to jump and place cones at the same time. I have big hands so I can curl my index finger to jump and press square to combat this
* Might take time to get used to

&amp;#x200B;

This is what works for me so I thought I would share this here. Let me know your thoughts.",FortniteCompetitive

But the TacSMG is the only one out of them that got changes during it's time: We have received the damage drop off for SMGs. TacSMG didn't have it to it's time making it better than Scars on long range. I used to rock two TacSMGs and a Shotgun. But with damage drop off it will be more balanced and act like the current SMGs we have just a little bit better.

Anything else didn't receive any real changes except for Planes maybe (leaks suggested that they have a fuel now; nothing confirmed though.). Even if Bouncers were liked to the end of the galaxy, we don't know how they would change competitive. As of then build fights were always decided by who has more bouncers and this fact got proven with the return of them in the unvaulted LTM. So the TacSMG is the only way.",FortniteCompetitive

They make impulse decisions and stick with them regarding of obvious evidence against otherwise.

They don't want this FOV because their vision is to make all systems fair, when that simply isn't the case and a terrible argument along with the motion sickness.

They don't realize the consequences between sitting 10 feet away and 10 inches away. They think it's all the same.

These guys are businessmen, not competitive gamers. 

I deal with higher authority on a daily and 9 times out of 10, when they come up with their OWN decision, it's automatically right in their eyes, they are never wrong, and they will never change their mind.

What they say is final.

I bet the Fortnite devs hate this. The people who care about the game and are fed up with making obscure decisions based on CEO leadership.

They grind their teeth because they know it's destroying their game.

The only thing they could do is ban together and all go on strike and not show up to work. They don't do that, they need to feed their family.

The CEO always wins.

I see 1 option for us to get what we want and that is contact the CEO, make a fair STERN statement regarding the things we want in competitive.

At this point I don't even care about ballers, I just want to see my feet and see in a box.

I'm sure the Epic Devs want the same, but they hide in the shadows about their opinions and communicating with us so they don't lose their job.

If XXiF receives no consequence, with various evidence provided against him, others will follow in his footsteps knowing no action will be taken and it is ""allowed to do"". However, if Epic decides the evidence is sufficient, his career is gone.

My stance: I'm not a huge fan of second chances but as of now, this is his career and to have it taken away seems unjustified in a sense. This cannot go under the radar, a statement or action needs to be taken. In my opinion, his Week 3 Solo Qualifier performance should not count, he shouldn't be allowed to participate in Week 5 Solo Qualifier, and should return upon close supervision for the following Qualifiers.

An unneeded addition which will ruin competitive altogether. It will bring teaming in planes back.

  


Infinity sword:

No

  


Grappler

A fairly balanced item but not as worth as heals with it's 10 chargers. Good for temporary height escapes or regaining height but brings along risk of getting shot by campers.

In other game modes it's a good item for high ground mobility and for retakes.

  


Bouncer:

A great item that has multiple uses. Slight high ground retake, mega launch pad,negate fall damage without using materials.

Will only be used to get people stuck or bounced around in comp, negating fall damage will risk damage to self by others. Can be used in other ways too. Overall a very positive and useful item.

  


Drum gun:

Overall an unbalanced gun that has too much dps. It can tear through wood easily and damage through. Sure many people probably keep a stair + wall while being sprayed but it can be situational and end up bad for you.

Will probably be nerfed soon after release due to complaints from known players or the community.

Adding another gun to the green and blue rarity loot pool

Green rarity has 9 weapons and 5 utility items.

Blue has 12 weapons and 4 utility items.

If this is added we can expect a vault of a different item (maybe basic pistols)

  


Tac smg

Overall decent weapon with quite high dps.

Pretty much that's all. Quite popular among casuals ( so is the drum gun sadly) I myself am a casual and would prefer bouncers or grapplers.

Tac smg goes into 3 loot pools.

Blue and green have been discussed above

Purple rarity

A rarity that has 15 weapons and 1 utility(slurp)

Would pretty much ruin purple rarity as smgs itseld need to have a high drop chance(compared to others)

  


Will update this post soon with other info.

Going for wall replaces is risky (can get edited on, 3rd partied). It should be rewarded, and not just to low ping players.

I'm making this post just in case you've missed what has been going on these past few weeks. Here are some of the most recent Epic replies in our subreddit concerning some bugs and issues you may have encountered recently. 

We also know how important it is for your voice to be heard and issues like these to be brought up, however, we want to reduce the number of duplicate posts there is a day about certain topics. We know almost everyone is not content with the FOV changes and explanations, but we do not need a new thread about the FOV slider every hour or every day. So we will be removing any duplicate threads about FOV with the exception of high-quality threads regarding FOV.  

The Avengers Endgame AutoMod filter has been lifted! You may have had trouble recently trying to post or comment as AutoMod has removed based on certain words but that should be over now. We will still be keeping an eye out for comments or posts that may seem spoilery. 

Thank you!

&gt;If anyone has an example of it being broken, we'd appreciate a clip and description to help determine what is happening.  It also appears there may be some confusion as to how it's supposed to work after the update.

&gt;As of 8.40, the expected behavior for Anonymous Mode in Arena &amp; Tournaments is that players will appear as Anonymous in all cases except:

&gt;* When they are eliminated from the match they will be shown in the elimination feed.
* When they eliminate another player, the player that they eliminated will be the ***only*** player shown their name. *\[NOTE: This aspect is known to be broken and will be updated in a future release, currently this remains shown as Anonymous.\]*

&gt;Neither scenario is expected to cause an increase in stream sniping, but were made to improve viewing experience for people watching streamers play in tournament.

If you have yet to receive a payment, please verify that you are inputting the accurate information at [www.fortnite.com/esports](https://www.fortnite.com/esports).

&gt;We are also cross checking our payment system to find if there might be any additional issues that could be causing delays from the Fortnite Summer Smash event at the Australian Open. If we identify any problems, we will follow-up with an email to all participants.

&gt;Payments are also still being verified and processed from our Fortnite World Cup lead-up and Online Open tournaments. To help keep track of current payment status, we’ll be releasing a public tracker soon that players can reference, in addition to our regular email updates.

&gt;Please remember to reach out to [competitive-payments@epicgames.com](mailto:competitive-payments@epicgames.com) if you have questions.

I think this is a step into the right direction. Epic has done a great job in adjusting the loot pool in the Team Rumble LTM. No grey rarity weapons, increased ammo, ""fun"" items such as the grappler etc. People are able to loot quickly and get right to fighting. However, there was never a separation between loot pools between pubs and the Arena mode. In my opinion, players who only play pubs should have NO influence on which items should be unvaulted in Arena mode. Just like arena players shouldn't have any influence on which items should be unvaulted in pubs. I think a great way to balance this out is let people vote after each game they play. This means that after someone plays a pub game they get one vote and so on. By doing this you allow players who spend more time on the game to have a bigger voice and also satisfy players of both playlists as their votes will only affect the game mode that they spend time on.

Also, I still sometimes get the bug where the trap will place between a tile instead of on a wall, despite Epic Games' saying that they fixed it in their recent Competitive Blog.

Turn your headset down!,"I just read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bix49x/blue_light_exposure_and_the_risk_of_macular/) post about macular degeneration and blue lights and I had no idea. I also wanted to share something I've been preaching to my friends for ages: You probably have your audio turned up way too loud.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tinnitus from gaming. My ears ring all day, every day. When I wake up, when I go to sleep, literally any time it's quiet I hear a high pitched ringing in my ears. Hearing loss isn't just from a onetime loud noises, different decibel levels take different a duration to damage your ears. So when some of us are grinding fortnite for 4 or 8 hours a day, we are way more susceptible to damaging our hearing at volumes that are just barely too loud.

&amp;#x200B;

Another thing is Fortnite's sound is terrible. Everything is so insanely loud, and the quiets are too quiet. I did a quick test and in order for me to hear the quietest noises in fortnite (like enemy footsteps or chests 2 squares away), the gunshots and vehicles register at 78 decibels, at 80 decibels you start to have hearing loss after 2-4 hours . I used an inaccurate decibel meter and I've already lost some hearing, so these numbers might not be exact, but I know it's close enough to show that it's too easy to reach hearing loss loudness. [Here is a chart that tells you the different durations needed to damage hearing](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing_loss/what_noises_cause_hearing_loss.html)

&amp;#x200B;

Let me just tell you, having the peacefulness of silence taken away and replaced with ringing absolutely blows. Take care of your hearing, especially when you are on the 8 hr weekend grinds, and turn it down a bit when you aren't playing in cups or scrims.",FortniteCompetitive

Without the protection, you will almost certainly be forced into a suicidal fight where you are likely to end up getting eliminated even if you win the challenge as others in a fort pick you off.

&amp;#x200B;

What seems to be rampant are 1x1 build macros. Players are building these structures almost instantaneously. There is no way any human being can select a wall tile and then left click 4 times while moving the mouse to turn the avatar in less than say 1 second. It should actually be very easy for Epic to figure out which players are using macros to gain an advantage but there has been no enforcement on their end unlike their rigorous action on players who compete in multiple regions.

It's impossible to replace any wall and sometimes I struggle in buildup fights as if we place a ramp or any type of building against someone who has 0 ping, their building would place first and there a lot of issues we are facing in daily basis specially with end zone.

With all this been said, we have a lot of good players who are in the top 100 ranking worldwide in kills and wins ( I am in top 4000 in total kills) but now with the world cup we are losing the ping advantage. I mean it's called world cup but it's not a fair chance to everyone.

Bugs and hitches from time to time, sure. But not ok as a guaranteed experience every day. Even if I only play a few games, like 3-5 per day, I will still encounter a game breaking performance issue every single session. That just isn't ok. 

There really couldn't possibly be a higher priority than stabilizing this game right now. I believe a philosophical shift needs to occur in epic's update strategy. Whether that means less updates overall (abandoning every 2 week update cycle), or simply focusing on performance while delaying new content, SOMETHING has to change.

They basically said we realize 80% of you want it in the game, but we’re going to ignore your vote. And now they’re having a literal election to decide something they’re going to do with the game??? What the fuck is their logic lmao.",FortniteCompetitive

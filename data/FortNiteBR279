This is because people want the final skin form to be exclusive, but also not be a mind-numbing grind. Locking the character behind a certain win total would make the skin both exclusive, and not be a painful chore for good players.

To perfect this, the right win total would need to be chosen. What I am thinking is if you are a good player, it is not difficult at at all to get a win each day. So say if season 5 is 70 days long, that would mean locking the skin behind 70 solo, duo, or squad wins. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

A lot of people have been waiting to see the llama today and are so disappointed in this behavior. 

They promised to bring the llama back tomorrow but let's do something about it now !  


What about tweeting a specific hashtag under all their tweets until they bring the lama back ?

I am kinda upset that the grind to get full armor Omega is too high. Yes, I do play a good amount, and I also win many matches. Although I feel like the XP system needs to get overhauled, and fixed. See, I have a full time job, and I don’t get to play until it’s 7pm and I try to game for 3 hours. Within those 3 hours, I’ve only leveled up one complete level. Sometimes, I may be short by a couple hundred XP. I would really like to see it EPIC is working on a solution for more XP rewards. I really would love to unlock the Omega armor, but I feel like reaching level 80 is highly time consuming if you’re a full time working adult. I recently finished a game with 16 Kills, and won. I only got 2,500xp from that. That made me feel bummed out, because it was a hard fought game, to only get such little xp. Which led me to create this post.

My Idea for an XP system would go something like this:
For the first 10 kills, you get 100XP each. (We all know it can be hard to obtain 10+ plus sometimes)
Every kill after should be 50XP. 
Sniper “One Shot, One Kills” should be 150XP.
(If the shot was over 100m it should give an extra 25XP per every 100 extra meters)
Also when you inflict damage towards an enemy with an RPG with their own blast. For example, if they’re rushing me, and the shoot, but I put up a wall which kills them. I believe it should reward you.

Anyone have more ideas?",FortNiteBR

Is getting to level 80 hard?  Yes.  Is it required of you to get to level 80 in order to play Fortnite?  No.  So what's the issue?  You want to play Fortnite, but you don't want to play **that** much Fortnite?  Fine, what's the problem?  You like playing Fortnite, but don't like grinding?  Okay cool, so what's the issue here?  Oh you like playing Fortnite, but your Fortnite experience doesn't allow you to get a certain unique aesthetic?  What kind of debauchery is that, Epic!? How could you do such a thing where only a small portion of players put in the time to earn a special skin....If the fact that there is a level 80 reward in any way ruins the Fortnite experience for you, then you have some internal issues you need to work out.  And no that's not some petty jab, I'm serious.  If you put an extra skin so high up on a pedestal that you think that you **MUST** have it in order to enjoy Fortnite, and if you don't have it the game is unfair and ruined for you, then you are severely detached from reality.

I'm sitting here at level 72 and won't be getting the skin.  I didn't feel like putting in the time then, and I don't feel like putting in the extra time now.  So next season will come along and I won't have all of the Omega variations.  And that's 100% fine by me.  I didn't put in the work.   I don't get the reward.  Some people did put in the work.  And they can wear the extra skin as they please.  Not to mention, there are **plenty** of intermediary aesthetics that the bulk of the Fortnite population can enjoy.  It's not even hard to reach tier 100 in the battle pass which gives you tons of aesthetics AND free Vbucks, yet people are complaining about a level 80 reward....such a joke.  ",FortNiteBR

 I love the game, and I don't come across it every match, but it feels awful getting killed by an exploiter. I shouldn't have to abuse game mechanics to be on a level playing field with everyone else, and the longer Epic remains wishy-washy on the subject, the more people will start doing so.

How cool would it be for extinct animals roaming the map be? Like a dodo bird or a small dinosaur or if Loot Lake still exists, Nessie can randomly pop out and leave a few chests, but then guards them but is tougher than the other regular roaming animals. Another Boss Roam could be a T-Rex or a Pterodactyl. And if you kill the regular ones, they drop meat, which can heal you like 50 health. They can be annoying like if they hit you, they take 100 random mats or they do a insignificant amount of damage or they can only do shield damage. Just something.

TL;DR - Extinct Animals should roam around and not do much damage, and killing them drops meat, which heals you. Maybe Boss Roams like a T-Rex or Nessie.",FortNiteBR

Even if only for a week or something, a second chance to level up and unlock old rewards would be a godsend. I had a lot of personal things going on when the first battle pass was live and it would be awesome for those of us who absolutely love Fortnite but were unable to unlock the top rewards to have another chance. By keeping it selective for only those who had the pass when it was originally available, this shows a reward for sticking around since the beginning along with the opportunity to unlock the prizes, but also keeps the skins rare, sticking with their “elitism”, which keeps the portion of a fanbase where this is a problem happy.

He was playing Fortnite on PS4 when his 6 year old son started messing with the game when he was out of the room.

Unfortunately for my Bro-in-Law he purchased £240 worth of Vbucks (I still laughed hard when he told me this - Like in his face laughing)

He’s never purchased Vbucks before or since, the Vbucks remains untouched, he has emailed Sony/Epic and has been refused a refund. His son has been diagnosed with ADHD and he got extremely upset when he was told what he had done.

Just looking for advice on how to get a refund for the guy, he’s given up at this point, but he want’s to buy his Son a Switch for his Bday. As punishment/now being unable to afford, he isn’t. So this is my attempt to get some advice on how to fix the problem.

Again Vbucks remains untouched, surely Epic can just take the Vbucks back and refund right?

Eventually I ran across a random duo partner who bragged about it and told me how he was doing it, etc. Ever since then I have been looking into it and have come to realize that there are an insane amount of people, just on Xbox, using the various devices available to cheat.

In a recent case a Fortnite cheat was infected with malware that turned out to impact HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of users using it. That means hundreds of thousands of people were cheating with just that one method and I've discovered at least 7 or 8 in my own research.

But here's the main reason I want to bring this up. After finding the cheats and watching the videos and learning how they work I now know what to look for. In many cases previously I would be killed and would think it seemed fishy but never pushed the issue. Now I always spectate and the majority of the time I end up finding someone running one of these cheats.

As of last night at 8PM I have personally found and reported 47 cheaters on Xbox. I've kept their names and check on them regularly to see if they are still playing - usually by viewing their FN stats. Every single one is still playing.

Essentially, Epic is doing nothing about it and it's ruining the game. The cheats are damn good. The aim abuse is on point, the auto build scripts, the head peaking, the double dumping, etc. Some of them are just time savers but others are straight up competitive advantages and just ruining the game for everyone else.

Epic, I hope you see this and I hope you can share with us a plan to combat the literally millions (across all platforms) of cheaters that are using your game.",FortNiteBR

Skins don't completely define skill level but they certainly are an indicator. I can't understand why this is such a touchy subject for people on here.

I would love to see the Battle Pass free, so people that may not want to put money into the game or can't then have a chance to earn the best skins in the game, although it is actually impossible kinda because the XP is so bad you won't make it to level 100

So how will they earn there money 

So with the current XP and stuff it's basically impossible to get a high tier without the battle pass so you pay for the challenges that then get you to the higher levels so this way people that don't put money have a chance to get the skins but the Battle Pass will allow the challenges and to get a better chance of completing the battle pass  ",FortNiteBR

He averaged somewhere around 15K viewers and had less than 20K subscribers. He was grinding hard, making great content, entertaining, and raged like a maniac. Everyone loved it, and that's what caused him to become the biggest name in video games in the world. 

Nowadays, he is forced to be very politically correct, including no swearing. Nothing about it seems natural anymore. And ever since season 4, he starts off his streams with a solo or two, then goes straight to squads and drops Lucky Landing every other game and gets maybe 5 kills. Am I the only one who thinks it's boring to watch? From January to April, he was hands down the best streamer. Now I'd rather watch TFue grind out 20+ kill solos and find new ways to kill the last enemy, or drop 30 kills in a teams of 20 game, or pro 1v1s in playground mode. 

Ninja hasn't lost his skill or personality by any means. To me though, he just isn't channeling either one in the right way anymore.",FortNiteBR

But it honestly has helped me and helped progress my play style, while actually helping me gain a win or two. 

*Always assume someone is watching you once a battle has finished. Someone has seen it, they have been watching the whole time, and knows you’ve taken damage, he many of you there are, see your play style, and is debating on weather or not to push you.*

Often times we see fights between a 1v1 or two squads, and more often then not, after an initial battle the winning team will be pushed by a stalking team. Effectively catching the winners off guard and gaining twice the amount of loot, while taking virtually none of the damage.  

How you can adapt to this really varies and depends on play style as well as the specific situation you are presented with.

When playing squads with a full group of friends, we often allocate one person to stay back and a bit separated from the group, no greater then a half a square on the map, and hidden, so to be not far enough behind us to be a help if something goes wrong. This provides us with two advantages. One, anyone coming up on us thinks we are a 3 player squad, while also giving us a wider eye outside of the battle to view any other potential threats. And two, a back up line of fire to draw those secondary incoming players that try and overtake you after a victorious fight, giving you time to heal and reload/rebuild. This just gives us time to bandage up, and potentially turn the tides on that secondary battle. 

Just a thought, what are yours? ",FortNiteBR

Then we got caught in the storm and were definitely all going to make it in but a little bit damaged.  One of my teammates just barely beat me into the circle and immediately put up walls and a bouncer facing back into the storm just as I got there and it bounced me back into the storm.

Snipers are perfectly balanced imo, being able to 1 shot if it hits the head seems reasonable.

Silenced Pistols however, does around the same damage as silenced smg BUT has 1/2 its magazine size and you have to spam click it.

Running around with your mobile phone in your pocket.


Ding ding - notification - There is a lama somewhere around you.



Open the app, use the camera to look around and voala - you found one. Get the materials and continue with your day


Ding ding - there is a vending machine - use some materials to get a nice Scar and prepare for battle


Keep walking to gain ammo...


Ding ding - you have new chalenge. Go home, log in and do something with your Scar to unlock something


Ding ding - you have new challenge. Go outside, find something in your city and use the app to ""spray"" on it. Congratulations, you received 10 Battle Stars and 4000 xp points

It got me back into fortnite and hyped for season 5. If you are going to do something like this again (and i hope you do), i have some suggestions:

\- The main thing that annoyed me, was that the puzzle didnt seem to have any in-game effects or consequences (i know it hasnt finished yet, but its looking like it will turn out that way). It didnt really matter if we solved the puzzle or didnt. For example, next time you could not release the next season until we had solved it (not suggesting you do this, just an example).

\- Reduce/remove the time between clues. It got annoying that we had to keep waiting until the next clue was released,  and couldnt solve it right away. It got to the point where we had just given up and were waiting on the next clue (eg, Durr Burger, Llamas, Rifts).

\- Too many different things going on at once. It seemed like there were just too many different codes and sounds and things going on at once. My suggestion, is that you stick to one or a few clue trails at once, and not reveal the next clue, until the previous had been solved.

Everything else i think you did really well, especially the real life locations and durr burger. It was really cool having an ""NPC"" of sorts, that you could talk to and ask questions.",FortNiteBR

This is really bad for the game.

Most of your players that started on late season 2 or season 3 got shit on while learning. We are still here playing the game. The game is RNG enough that even if you are a brand new player you can still get kills and you can still pull a win.

Obviously if you never played an FPS before it's gonna be tough, but it's not hard.

Especially with Playground and so much content and beginner guides for fortnite, it's easy to learn enough to get a win in like a week.

I started playing fornite cause it was FUN and SKILLFUL, game gave you complete freedom, there wasn't really much spray and pray like there is now. There were those weird trees that gave more wood than the rest of the trees, there were no swap weapon delays, no over saturation of weapons that don't accomplish anything, why do you need 4 pistols in the game that nobody even uses, why do you need like 4 or 5 spraying weapons that basically serve the same purpose (yet you remove crossbow that was very unique?)

The game is getting really boring and adding SBMM I think will be the last straw for a lot of players, if I'm fighting tryhards and good players every game, and dying every 2nd or 3rd fight I'm not going to continue playing. This is not a round based game or a death match game, where you spawn back really fast, this is a BR game. SBMM doesn't work for BR games, please remove it.",FortNiteBR

I also play a decent amount of time as someone with a job and a life, like 3-4 hours 3-4 days a work week and another good 10-14 hours on weekends. I am level 71 right now and I could've reached level 80 if I forced myself to play more than I wanted and did the cheesy iPhone afk tactic that most people did, I could've also forced myself to play squad even if I hate that mode because I know you can get double the exp there.

I'm not mad that I didn't reach lvl 80, Omega is not my type of skin. But I am mad about the way Epic did this ""challenge"". Getting to lvl 80 is not a challenge, it's a grind and it takes no skill, like literally no skill. I think a maxed out Omega should give a you a feeling like ""oh shit boy, this guy can perform"" but right now it gives me more of a feeling like ""well guess he played some squads and mobile afk'ed"". That's probably not even the case everytime but since it's the most efficient method it might be true often and let's be honest, according to the average skill level of maxed out Omegas it's most probably true often.

Winning a solo gives roughly 1.3-1.5k exp and takes a good 30 minutes, so 2.6k-3k exp per hour IF you win two games. Afk'ing in a bush or unter a tree in the middle of the map gives you 760exp guaranteed, so a guaranteed 3k. How on earth should that be how you complete the ""challenge""?
Why isn't the challenge something like get x total kills and x total wins? At least that would be something you need some skill for. 

When I read ""not everyone is supposed to get maxed out Omega"" I always think to myself ""well, everyone is able to get him, because you can afk farm exp 8 hours a day and then play active for even more"". I would've been so hyped about a skin that will show that the wearer has a good amount of skill and that freaks people out right wenn they see it.

Like I said, I'm not mad for not reaching level 80, because I think I, like everyone, had the chance to reach it by using every possible way to farm exp but there's no fun in that and the amount of posts and comments of people saying they're now burned out by the game and need a break should really alarm Epic for learning from it and never ever doing such a stupid ""challenge"" again.


tldr; The current ""challenge"" of reaching level 80 is not a challenge, it's an annoying grind that takes no skill at all. The next tier 100 challenge should be focused on kills and wins to take some skill to finish it. Also Epic should really be aware of all the people burned out by their game just because lvl 80 was a pain in the ass to get.

I'm lvl 71, I won't reach lvl 80 but I could've if I wanted to. I'm just more into winning solo's than grinding 50v50 or mobile afk'ing.",FortNiteBR

For instance:
- deal damage with x
- search chests in x
- search battlestar between x
- get eliminations with x
- etcetera.


My suggestion is to implement harder, long-term challenges into the game.
Take a look at the calling card challenges you used to get in the call of duty series.
The challenges are a lot harder, but you'd rock a calling card a lot of players don't have (makes it more rewarding).

For example:
- Stick a sticky bomb on a teammate who then needs to kill an enemy by running into them.
- kill x enemies by shooting c4
- get a victory royale with x weapon/explosive
- Fire an entire Sniper magazine into your enemies without missing
- etc.


The more difficult challenges can also be grouped into a special hard task week, just like the blockbuster challenges were seperated from the weekly challenges in season 4.

wall of text incoming coupled with poor language skills - you have been warned!


About a month ago E3 happened and they announced the Fortnite Switch release. Having heard about the game (like everyone on Earth) but owning a pretty shitty Computer, i was pretty enthusiastic about giving it a try. 

Because of final exams i couldn't play immediatly, so i started two days after release (about the time Week 7 started)

After playing about two games in which i died ten to fifteen seconds after landing i somehow thought ""This is pretty fun"" and bought the Battle Pass followed by buying tier 100 because i wanted to get Omega and at max tier the stars giving exp contribute to that a lot.

Playing the game with a friend (no BP) was a lot of fun and the seven weeks of challenges provided a lot of exp which made the leveling somewhat fast.
My skills got better, but i'm still not that good at shooting and my building skills are the worst. (Best i can do is build a 1x1 in an okay time)

Because of me being bad i was too anxious to play squads with random people, i tried it a few times but overall it was a pretty bad experience, so i did about 95% of the grind in Solos.

I was determined to make it to level 80 until i was about L48 and i saw the Season 4 Exp Sheet.
532k is a lot of exp and 62 being just halfway to 80 made me determined to atleast reach level 65 to complete Carbide but weeping inside that i would'nt get full Omega.

Then Epic dropped the double exp weekend and i was hoping again.
I played a lot that weekend and got from 52 to 68. The last few levels were completed while i had a few days off of work, starting at 9 am and going to bed at 4 am, with short breaks to eat or use the bathroom.
(Being bad my average exp/hour should be a lot lower than what people achieve normally)

In the end i made it to 80 with 4 days till the end of the season.
It was hard starting the season with just 22 days left, being completely new and bad. I would have loved to have a boost for new Switch players to catch up on everyone else who played since the start.

I'm actually 82 with about 40 Wins (Switch doesn't track any stats...)
The games afterwards have been a lot more fun than the grind.
Also, i'm not going to use full Omega until i'm better at the game.

I would like to thank Epic for this amazing game and the effort they put into this game.
It was amazing how they handled the Playground LTM downtime, working on the problems while constantly communicating with the players.

I can't wait for Season 5, with all the awesome stuff happening right now like burgers in deserts or llamas all over the world it's going to be a blast.


TL;DR:

Started after Switch release playing exclusively on Switch and got to L80.
Was not a fun grind.
May show that full Omega is just an indication of time put in the game not skill.
Enjoy the game a lot more without a deadline.
Season 5 will be awesome.",FortNiteBR

Skins are such a big deal it is Epic's largest income.

Epic has taken advantage of this by releasing lets say Battlehound, Red Knight, Scarlet Defender, Crimson Scout and the Wukong. 

Each of these releases made a significant rise in usage of the skins and these skins were all related to seasons for example Season 2, Chinese New Year and Saint. Patricks Day.

These skins lost their attractive value after being re-released. Epic also get a lot of money for doing these things. But i think they should make more and more skins rare instead of recycling every single skin they release.

It'll be notime until Power Chord drops and some of the hardcore players will lose interest in the game.

When a new trend arrives, the casual players will quit the game after spending 40 bucks on the rare skins that dropped lately and the hardcore players may also lose interest in the game after their ""OG"" skin being overused.

Im not gonna lie im a huge spender on fortnite and hardcore (sort of) player. Fortnite is gonna die out soon if they keep re-releasing old skins and weapons to cater for the new players.

Anyways, whats your opinion on this?

So Epic, what's the deal here? Playground v2 can't be worked on while the current version is still up? At the very least keep it since it isn't as buggy, laggy and toxic as 50v50 is.

 First off this explanation will make more sense if you've both seen the Donnie Darko film and read the incredible detailed article from this link [http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/explanation/](http://www.donniedarko.org.uk/explanation/)

Terms to be familiar with (from link).

PU = Primary Universe 

TU = Tangent Universe 

PoTT = Philosophy of Time Travel

After reddit user u/-_Akira_\- made a post of how Frank from Donnie Darko looks similar to the Season 5 teaser image it made some connections between Fortnite &amp; Donnie Darko clear.

The Tangent Universe

So, the PoTT states that occasionally the fourth dimension can get corrupted, causing a TU. A TU will begin around the time of a corruption, for example a highly advanced rocket which broke a rip within BR and seemingly teleported in and out of reality could very likely cause this corruption. This TU is unstable and can't last long, perhaps 1 Fortnite season in length before it collapses in upon itself? This collapse will destroy both the PU (pre rocket launch BR) and TU, unless the corruption is fixed. 

Artefacts 

According to the PoTT when a TU is created an artefact will spontaneously appear. This artefact is also always metal. In the Fortnite TU the Anchor is the first artefact to appear. Metal? Yes. The PoTT also states where these artefacts come from is never disclosed, sorry guys probably no pirate ships :,( . Now onto the disappearing artefacts - As the TU is an exact copy of the PU everything from the PU is copied into it. However, during this copying it is possible for there to be a glitch and two of any particular object may be formed, much like our beloved Tomato Head, Durr Burger and even grass patch. These duplicate artefacts make the TU unstable; the anomaly of having duplicate objects is hard to handle. So for the TU to unravel without making a black hole is must once again be an exact copy of the PU. This means that the Tomato Head and Durr Burger must be removed. BUT, don’t be sad, this means these artefacts may not be where they originally were but instead are in the fourth dimension waiting to be returned somewhere and some-when into the Fortnite BR once again during Season 5.

Living Receivers

Here comes a possible Season 5 story arc. 

When a TU occurs with an artefact, then a living receiver is also chosen. I believe this to be all BR players in Season 5. These people chosen to guide the Artefact out of the TU. Here it is likely that the Season 5 BattlePass will have challenges instructing player on ways to fix the TU by guiding these artefacts out of the TU (Anchor, carriage and likely more to come - look around moisty) and ultimately resolving the corruption to the BR PU.

In terms of the websites theory, these three subheadings are the most relevant to this theory (and easiest to explain), but feel free to read about them in the link and share and possible additions to this theory you see fit.

Not sure about you guys, but I'm super excited if this is the type of story line we will receive in Season 5. Discuss your thoughts in the comments and any questions, I'm interested to hear it all.

(also I'm agreeing with u/Jettisonian who has hereby ordered for the cat mask character to be called Frank.) ",FortNiteBR

I know most of you will disagree with me, but in season 3 people were asking for a reward that would award playtime in some way and that not everyone would be able to get it. Now you get the level 80 reward and it's bad because you have to grind for it. I've achieved level 83 without a problem (no grinding) with a decent amount of playtime, obviously, mostly playing solos and duos. You have to realise that the reward isn't meant to be rewarded to everyone who plays, it's enough that probably about 75&amp;#37; people get it, there's meant to be some exclusivity to it. It's not even a massive reward, it's a bit more added lighting to a single skin, so I really don't see the reason why you can't accept the fact that not everyone should get the highest prize of the season.

tl;dr - The level 80 reward is meant to be exclusive, so it's perfectly acceptable that you have to either ""grind"" or just play the game daily for some amount of time.",FortNiteBR

Firstly, I would like to continue on my previous post where i explained about the new locations. Well, Greasy Grove is another location which will be changed for season 5, it will be renamed Ancient Arena and will be a small city like Tilted Towers but with a Colosseum in the middle hence the name Ancient Arena. It will be an Italian town so it will be quite colourful, it will have canals running through the middle with little boats. The Colosseum will be the main attraction in this city and will be directly in the middle of the town and will be filled with chests. Ancient Arena is arguably the best looking area in the game.


Thats all the news i have regarding new map changes as of now. However, one big piece of news i have is that on the release of Season 5 before the game loads up, You will be shown a 4-5 mini movie which tells the story of what has happened regarding the fracture in the sky.

We loved it! We wanted to support the game and bling ourselves too so we bought the battle pass. The only problem is we came in mid-end of the season. There was ample time to reach tier 100 but there isn't enough to reach level 85 to unlock Omega's final skin tier.
Many of us are hard stuck 50-60.  (inb4 git gud)
The puzzling thing to many of us is why should we not get something we paid for? 
We didn't even have the same amount of time everyone else had.
I mean come on, challenges that are locked behind certain levels are literally not creative at all and just blatant grinding.
For that I have a suggestion.
To unlock the next tier of a skin make a challenge like
'Get 20 kills with the Omega skin' instead of 'Reach level 85.'
I'm sure this will be downvoted to hell but I know there are many others who feel the same and I just need to get this off my chest.

I really think nerfing the materials is a bad idea. The reason Fortnite is popular is because of 2 main aspects. One because the game is free to play and second because you can build. Building is the difference between Fornite and all the other battle royale games. In fortnite you can outplay your opponent, you can build up to get the highground, and if you in a open field you dont have to worry about having no cover. Fortnite should be going in the opposite direction i think they should increase the amount of materials you get from objects in the game. Building is the fun part of this game nerfing the materials will only kill the game. Many of my friends that played fortnite have stopped playing because of the recent nerfs.

Nothing works. Legit just gonna have to give up and let them go. I just wanted to have the collection man, its gonna haunt me one day.

I've actually given up and now I'm here in hopes that somebody is kind-hearted enough to go through it all for me and allow me to do the final process of just linking my epic with a twitch prime.

I feel like a lot of people that rage about KB+M usage on console haven't actually tried it for themselves. 

It is really not that extreme of an advantage, considering the input lag and mouse acceleration that you have to deal with. Everyone you play against will have aim assist as well, while you won't without the use of XIM. I genuinely feel like only a really good KB+M console player has a huge advantage over the average console player. The biggest giveaway of a KB+M console player isn't fast building, which many console players have gotten pretty good at; it's fast editing and weapon swapping.

Many people suggest a separate queue for KB+M users on console, but this is not possible. Epic doesn't know when a user has a keyboard plugged in - even if they did, people could just plug in their keyboard after joining a game with a controller. Besides, XIM4 is detected as a controller, making it impossible for Epic to differentiate between XIM4 and a controller. If anything, I think that playing against console KB+M users is a good gateway towards PC/console crossplay, where the skill gap is significantly larger and more noticeable.

And no, I'm not a KB+M console player, which is usually what people on this sub assume when I even hint at defending KB+M console players.

It’s always the same thing and it’s repetitive. The battle pass is refreshing, receiving skins/emotes/upgrades from leveling up is nice, but it seems like the rewards are more grind-based than skill-based.

Being rewarded in some way for the main objective of the game, getting the Victory Royale by besting 99 other players would be SO satisfying. I honestly believe this would not only make the dynamic of the game better, but it would also help drive sustainability within the player base.

Remember these are really just generalizations, as I am sure there are plenty of noobs, or people who just aren't sweaty who rock these skins. 

1: Recon Specialist: If there was a simple skin that just screamed ""try hard"" to me, it would be the Recon Specialist. These players typically try to over compensate for something, and will do lame things such as; emoting after killing you because they got the shotgun before you did, upon landing. 


2: Shadow Ops- this ones self explanatory. I don't really have much to say, besides the preconception of some sweaty nerd mashing his keyboard behind this character. 


3. Snorkel Ops: This is like Recon Specialist's counterpart. It is rare to see one of these people not look like they think they're trying to win a tournament, when in actuality, it's just a regular match. Maybe it's the snorkel and the blue pants, while
 the player is like ""tehe she's my waifu i le sniped you xD"" 


4. Elite Agent: People who still rock this skin after season 3 seem very determined to prove to you that they're ""the best"". 


5. Sparkle Specialist: no need to comment.

In my opinion, clingers + C4 need to be nerf'd and we may want to reconsider how ""spammy"" weapons like the Minigun + SMGs do damage to structures.**

To start things off, I do understand that epic is trying to test different gameplay styles. 

I want to start a discussion based on the current state of how 'splodes and other spam style weapons (mini-gun, tommy gun), and how everyone feels it is affecting the meta of this game.

From my recent experience playing FNBR I have noticed an incredible amount of people making sure they carry C4s. The more and more I see C4 it seems to be getting to the point I do personally feel they are overpowered. The destruction radius I think is much too wide, ensuring that no matter how well someone builds, pushes or hides there is no way to remain safe. The current state of C4 actually reminds me of the guided missile, something that is spammed while teammates push and spam with no regard.

I also feel that explodes in general should not be doing damage THROUGH structures. I can respect a well throw sticky nade that lands on the far side of my ramp, and it most definitely should break that ramp but it should not be doing damage to me as well.

I would like to start a honest conversation about this recent suppressed and tactical SMG buff. Nearly every fight I get into all people do is use one of the aforementioned smgs. They hold down fire and faze right through my builds and melt me in a matter of seconds. Where is the skill involved? I understand why they nerfed the shotgun damage. However, it still takes skill to hit headshots and when you hit a headshot you shouldn’t be getting 16,7,36,46, etc, etc damage each time. It requires almost no skill to spray and pray someone to death. It’s incredibly frustrating for someone to literally hold fire and melt my walls and me along with it. It doesn’t matter if I headshot them with a blue pump. I’m already dead at that point. I can outbuild them all day long and all they need to do is spray with a SMG and it’s over. Yes, I recognize that it isn’t impossible to kill someone who has a SMG but would I be wrong to say that they may be a bit too OP? I think that it is important for there to be more than one meta for close range engagements while keeping things as balanced as possible. For the longest time it was shotguns and I think that SMGs should be powerful, but not to the extent that they are now. I’ve seen many people stop using ARs because the SMGs are that powerful. As someone who loves fortnite and has been playing for a decent amount of time (December-present) it’s bewildering as to why they made them so powerful. Any thoughts on the matter than anyone has are welcomed and appreciated. ",FortNiteBR

My opinion on this:

1. Challenges are fine but being gated behind season level is just not justifiable for my battle pass purchase which requires a huge time investment just to collect them all as they may possibly not come back or obtained anymore.
2. Grind is a little too immense to burn out players just to get to level 80 to get the rewards.
3. By looking at the season 4 level calculator, a huge amount of time is needed to invest in order to gain levels on daily basis in order to reach level 80 with other factors to take into consideration.
4. It breaks my heart when I have bits and pieces of cosmetic armors from incomplete challenge from season's battle pass.
5. A plea from me if it is possible for us to complete the current season's omega set even after season 4 is over.

Questions to throw to the public:

1. What do you think about cosmetic pieces being separated by quests, can it be done in a better way?
2. Do you think season level 80 is a little too high to obtain the final piece of the whole cosmetic set?
3. Are there any better ways to obtain rewards in battle pass other than making players grind?
4. New ways to obtain exp for season levels?
5. Revise values of exp to level up?
6. Is it possible to have some sort of second chances to earn the rewards from the previous battle pass which you have missed?

Please remain civilized and respectful in this discussion.",FortNiteBR

The durr burger location in California is a hint at the map change coming, so expect deserts and sand dunes.

- Has existed since end of 2017, and grew in popularity from there.
- Pump is the highest damage gun for body shots and I'm quite sure it's also the highest headshot even after the nerf.
- When double pump is done, you are getting more DPS than the tactical shotgun, but with the same speed, *how is this fair in the slightest?*
- Epic has tried more than once to fix it, but it is still not fixed, why? There has to be a fix for it.
- I get downvoted for discouraging double pump because I find it to be unfair to the shotgun meta. Double heavy not any better because of its range advantage.
- Thanks for reading this wall of text, I hope I don't get hated for this post too, I just don't think it's a fair way to play the game and many people are abusing this bug for an advantage.

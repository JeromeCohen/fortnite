As a player base, we‚Äôve been met with terrible decision after terrible decision, and I‚Äôd say 3 or 4 seasons of questionable content. But these changes regarding the pump and the drum gun specifically are ridiculous. 

Your game relies HEAVILY on close quarters, FAST paced game play, which makes fortnite what it is. The combat shotgun is quite honestly, absolutely terrible. It hits hard at long range, yet close range seems to take 3 hits to kill someone, and that‚Äôs if they haven‚Äôt sprayed you down with a drum. Fights drag on way too much where you have to hit people multiple times, even with great accuracy and movement. Thus allowing more opportunity for 3rd partying with (guess what‚Äôs coming next...) MORE MOBILITY you‚Äôve added to the game. This is literally insane to me, how the hell are new players meant to come in to this game and have fun? You said you removed siphon due to overly aggressive plays, but you add in slipstreams to give aggressive players much more rotation and additional options to 3rd party.

It‚Äôs a joke.


TLDR; combat shotgun can‚Äôt counter drum gun, drum gun is a 3rd partiers dream, too much mobility, decision makers at epic need to PLAY their own game ffs.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is currently at its lowest skill gap of all nine seasons. There is little to no strategy that goes into conducting fights, as every single weapon can be sprayed. High kill games do not feel satisfying anymore, as most fights are won simply by overwhelming opponents with excessive spray. Shotgun aim has become far too forgiving. Miss a shot? Just spam the combat shotgun and pray you connect with your enemy. 

With the removal of the pump, it is nearly impossible to get back into fights when low, since reliable burst damage is nonexistent. A meta that once required precise edits has been formed into loadouts that simply exhausts enemies materials with spray, instead of strategically breaking/replacing walls, etc.

I would consider myself well above average, but the inability to do quick burst damage on opponents without exposing myself has led myself and my friends to consistently die to seemingly mindless players spraying their double-tommygun loadout.

It is extremely sad to watch a game that once took practice and precision turning into a mouse one/RT spam, spray and pray, W key, noob friendly atmosphere.",FortNiteBR

Where is the cable going into? The vault. What is in the vault? Weapons, but more importantly the big sphere, and most importantly, that mask on the desk. So all the way back in season 6 Kevin opened that hole in loot lake, we will be assuming that hole went all the way into the vault which means that the liquid that dripped out of Kevin is in the vault. This means it is somewhere in the vault is part of Kevin. But where? That sphere thing. Think about it, what other reason would a strange sphere be in the vault? It feels kind of out of place in a area that's meant to just store weapons that aren't currently in the game. So that is Kevin. The other part of Kevin that did not go into the vault (the solid part) exploded and opened a rift. This rift sucked all the players in and Kevin and the other half of Kevin became the butterfly. We will refer to the sphere as K1 and the butterfly as K2. But what about the rocks that were at loot lake? Those were ultimately just part of the cube vessel that was carrying Kevin and had nothing to do with Kevin themselves. So fast forward to the unvaulting. When we enter the vault Kevin is there and at the desk is the mask. This is important because it means the person in the tilted statue has already been to the vault. So now we get to the main theory. This person is the physical manifestation of K2. That is how they managed to get into the vault. So K2 (tilted statue person) has escaped the rift dimension to attempt to reunite with K1. So they visit the vault sometime in S7 or early S8 and successfully merge with K1. Now that Kevin is whole again they want to return to the island but cannot get out of the vault (they are still the sphere) so they use their powers to make runes that will charge Kevin's powers enough to open the vault door and  escape. The plan fails as the players retrive a weapon from the vault and leave Kevin behind. Kevin then triggers the volcano eruption with their remaining power for reasons that will all be explained later. So as shown by the arrival of Viking village in season 5 rifts are capable of time travel. So K2 sets up a Fail-Safe in the future by time traveling and providing neo tilted with a cable created with rift energy to draw Kevin's power out of the vault and slowly let them escape. K2 lets the citizens believe this is simply just a power scource, not freeing some rift cube being. Being as important as someone who supplied the cities power supply of course a statue would be made. So as I stated earlier plan A fails so now in season 9 plan B has begun. Kevin is now slowly escaping the vault through the cable and they are spread out around most of the power grid. To explain what happens next I will need to go all the way back to season 4. The visitor arrives on the meteor and creates the rocket. They then launch the rocket to trigger the rift. In the rift the visitor uses rift energy to become a more powerful being (Kevin) so Kevin is the visitor. The visitors final plan is unknown but whatever it is they will form it in season 9 and ultimately achive it in season 10. Season 10 will have a dystopian theme with the visitor/kevin as a sort of emporer (Think big brother) The visitor reaching their goal will dramatically effect the island and the game in many ways. Season 11 will possibly be Stone age themed after society starts over with the destruction of the visitor with little to no remains of what once was.",FortNiteBR

I understand that it can do inconsistent damage, but I think the positives far outweigh the negatives with this gun.
Firstly, it has the biggest clip size and fastest fire rate out of all the shotguns, which makes it extremely effective in a lot of situations.
Did I mention the range yet? You could get 30% of someone's shield from across something like 5 tiles.
I also think that this is an overall good decision for the meta. Even the best meta's can get boring after a while and I think replacing the pump was a perfect way to spice the game up. By vaulting the pump, those annoying fights where you jump around missing your shots and seeing who gets one pumped first are completely out of the equation.

I have to admit siphen was good but when it was gone I disliked it but I went along and the game for me during season 8 was a lot of fun I enjoyed playing the game. Season 9 came out and yes thank you dev‚Äôs for adding a bunch of new stuff as always but what the hell happened to the game. I don‚Äôt want to freaking hit someone for 40 5 times with a gray tack, or miss someone every time with a combat shotgun while they hit w key with a drum gun.

I love you epic for everything you‚Äôve done for this game but I‚Äôm done with this new stuff.

Back in the early days of Fortnite Battle Royale, when it was around season 2, it was extremely fun. Epic Games added new content weekly and the battle pass was loaded with amazing cosmetics. The word of Fortnite spread around like wild fire and Epic Games had huge numbers of players enjoying season 4. That‚Äôs when it all went downhill.

Epic Games started adding in new guns and items that actually ruined the game. The double barrel shotgun was insanely inconsistent with its damage. The new battle passes were filled with garbage that nobody ever uses like ‚Äúemoticons‚Äù that are stuffed in the back of you emotes inventory. It almost seemed like Epic Games was trying to just get us to buy the Battle Pass for money.

As if that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, some of these cosmetics are actually pay to win, meaning they give you an advantage if you spend money in game to get them. Some of the emotes/dances change your hit box (the area that your character can be hit in),making it harder for people to hit you. Take Fortnite‚Äôs emote, Flippin‚Äô Sexy, for example. The character flips backwards and lays down, making a unique hit box that is almost impossible to hit right away. But it‚Äôs not only emotes; girl skins are better than boy skins. Girl skins are smaller than boy skins- this doesn‚Äôt quite mean that they have changed the hit box, however it makes it easier to see around them and other players can‚Äôt see you as well. Also, dark colored skins blend in to dark areas better.  

While it‚Äôs not proven, some people that spend money in the game are almost always getting better guns, easier kills, etc. Back is season 3 I was a default skin until I bought the season 4 battle pass. I immediately started getting better and other people noticed my ever-improving skills ;). As a general rule, when people enjoy the game they continue buying cosmetics from Fortnite. Fortnite obviously wants these players to continue enjoying the game, but sometimes that doesn‚Äôt always work. They have been decreasing the skill gap so that noobs and pros are less separates and more equal, perhaps so the noobs are more likely to buy from the game. But is Fortnite taking this a step further and trying to give more valuable consumers first hand experiences? 

Fortnite used to be a good game but it has been obviously declining in players and the quality of content. Could they have actually turned to some of the most money hungry strategies known?",FortNiteBR

I personally believe that these poor decisions stemmed from community outcry and managerial direction on Epics part.

We as a community have rejected the idea of skill based match making but still want a game that focuses on skilled play. So epic gave us competitive, which has given the option to play against similar skilled players but the normal game is in shambles right now. Causals have to play with competitive players and they can't compete. Newbies have to compete with both and that doesn't work either. This is just one example that I believe could be a result that was caused by the descion to include players of experience to co exist.

The removal of the pump and addition of the drum gun has created an unbalanced game. In my opinion it has raised the skill gap in a way as well as lowering it. It has now made it possible for casual/newbies to get a few licks on a more experienced player but still ultimately lose. The experienced player still lives but has less health for later in the game which often brings their demise.

This sub is an echo chamber at times, where posts get removed and censored often. I see suggestions on here daily about changes that should be made by users that are decent ideas. Yet we as a community tear down anything epic implements that we don't agree with. It's ridiculous because they created Fortnite and we grew to love it but now it's been morphed and mangled into a monstrosity by some of our suggestions.

My biggest hope is that Epic stops listening to the community as much and gets back to what makes the game fun. I don't know what that is, I think only Epic can figure out what that is. We as a community should be critical of Epic's direction but not hateful to the point that we place all the blame on them. They are open to our ideas as shown in the last event. We should as a community be conscious of our posts and try to look at the positive points of the game.",FortNiteBR

We're back at a spray meta that ruins the game in my opinion. Ballers are also just such a dumb concept for a battle royale game. The bow doesn't fit in either. And the new slipstreams... I don't understand how anyone could think this would be a good idea. Especially after they already had the same problem with sip lines and geysers before. I'm really looking forward to see a worldcup game with a final circle with 20 players left alive right where one of these slipstreams is. 

I'm trying to have fun but I just can't the way this game is right now. 

My solution:

- Remove: tommy gun, new shotgun, tactical shotgun, bow

- Bring back the pump and reduce the damage

- Remove the slipstreams (there is more than enough mobility with redeploy and rifts)

- Bring back mats per kill or make farming faster again

Bring back all pump variants

Vault Drum gun

Remove Ballers (Quadcrashers are just as good for mobility)

Disable slipstreams after 2 circles

Nerf turtling by adding some sort of delay to spamming 1 wall in the same place. (Holding down left click takes no skill)

Add siphon back in its fullest form

Vault stupid items like shadow grenades and turrets

Vault combat shitgun

Bring back bouncers

Bring back heavy shotgun

Bring back bolt and vault suppressed sniper

Focus on bug fixes in updates

The only time it's been worse is during the two weeks of glider re-deploy.

When it Epic going to learn that no one really enjoys getting third partied?  

Here's how they fix it.  You should only be able to enter the slip stream from specific on ramps.  You should not be able to jump in at any point.

Secondly, building has never been in a less healthy state than it is right now.  Every fight turns into a close range battle because closing gaps has never been easier.  We want variety in engagements.  Epic needs to drop max materials to 500/500/500 at most.   Watching players build for five minutes straight because they have 3,000 mats is a complete travesty in game design.

Epic needs to turn this game back into the tactical/strategic game it once was.  A game where position and timing mattered.  Right now it's a sweat fest where only the sweatiest kids win due to turbo building and reflexes.

I have seen most, if all the meta's Fortnite has seen. This one is already, by far, the worst meta in the game's history. In Season 8, the majority of the players had complained about how the drum gun and the boom bow were very unbalanced guns. Even though the majority of players chose it, the drum gun got little to no nerfs/changes made to it since we last saw it in Season 5. The Boom Bow simply did way too much damage and you could get a lot of ammo for it late game since it used shotgun ammo. Me and countless other players were excited for Season 9, as we all had hope that just maybe Epic would start fixing their meta and would start working with the player base again. However, us hopeful ones were wrong once again. Season 9 rolls around, Pump is gone, new shotgun, Tac buffed, Drum Gun and Boom Bow barely nerfed. Epic, for what feels like the 100th time, disappointed us begin. The new shotguns and the Drum Gun rules the meta now, with (from what I've seen) 75% of the players I go up against using both of them. Players almost don't even have to play smart anymore, with you just having to keep on pushing into someone's 1x1 with a drum gun or a shotgun to kill players. I like how they tried to make the shotguns more consistent, but this is truly the wrong way to do it. If the majority of your fan base is complaining about how unbalanced a gun is, **its never good to just buff other guns to compete with it**. Those guns end up getting overpowered, and your game goes downhill very quickly. People like using the tactical and combat shotgun because the pump isn't in the game anymore, so they don't have to worry about taking heavy damage from just a couple shotgun shots. People like to use the drum gun because its overpowered. If the majority of your player base is using one gun, and there is a lot of other players complaining about it, there is a visible problem in your games meta. This problem starts becoming more visible in competitive playlists. If you, like me, like to play a lot of arena, you probably have also seen just how destructive and overpowered these few guns are in the end game of any competitive match. I'm sure I am not the only player who feels this way, as there is a plethora of pros, content creators, and even casual players who would agree with me on this. Now to the boom bow. The boom bow is a very overpowered weapon, as you can hit anybody for over 100 damage who is trying to build up in the end game of any game. It also holds shotgun ammo, allowing you to almost be able to spam it at other players in the end game of a competitive match with little to no consequences. Listen, if you want to solve the games multiple problems, bring back the Pump. Nerf the drum gun, shotguns, and boom bow. Otherwise, Fortnite is going to remain a toxic mess until you make an attempt to fix it.",FortNiteBR

Also I don't even like using shotguns. 

But it's just very clear to me that common, uncommon, and rare rarity pump shotguns + double pump is the most fair and balanced meta when it comes to close range encounters. 

I've been playing games most of my life and nothing about double pump seems unfair to me. It's both fun to do and competitively viable. And it's just cool. It looks cool and it feels cool. 

Considering how little damage shotguns do to walls it also makes building walls to defend more worth it. 

Oh and it would be good for the Fortnite devs because fights could end much more quickly. Reducing server strain. 

So yeah, I could go on but if Epic brought double pump back + the well designed aesthetic choice of the future this season I don't think anyone would have a reason to complain.

I am a streamer on YouTube named Wiikstrom. I have over 40,000 subscribers, a pretty decent following. I have been playing on nintendo switch since day one. Been loving it.  But this update has me changed. We always get the ""fixed Nintendo Switch frames"" update all the time. But if anything, it's getting worse. I also own a gaming PC, ps4, and an Xbox. I am definitely a gamer. I have fortnite on all platforms. Point is. I know how good fortnite is. Especially on PC. I have been playing controller on PC. And I'm better agasint then than I am nintendp players because of these problems : 

unrendered buildings for an entire 60 seconds... Literally sitting on a building basically lagging as it struggles to loud the building really sucks. And those mobile players we play against are already in there, with guns and sheilds and their 60fps. It's pretty hard to compete. 

On top of that we can't even have a STABLE 30 fps. Don't get me wrong. We don't need 60 fps to compete. I just want a stable 30. Anytime we move at all, shoot, build, we get a frame drop down to 15. Making it impossible to aim, missing shots, ending up staring at the sky for who knows what reason. I really hate reading that it is not possible to make this game work better. Because I 100% have the knowledge in this area and if fortnite / epic SIMPLY allowed us to change resolution, take off shadows, effects, etc. We would be 100% able to compete. It is the EASIEST fix. I hate complaining about this on stream when it can just be fixed. People tell me to not complain and play a different console. But why should I be forced to play a different console when its just epic being unwilling to allow us to change graphics ... 

I am really sick of the disadvantages. We have been playing for almost a year. It should be fixed by now.  Even mobile graphics would work...

Does more then 150 dmg, meaning that 100 health and two minis/a regular 50 pot still wont  save you.

You have to be at least 170-200 shield to survive a body shot.

Almost virtually no bullet drop.

Only ''bad'' thing is it reload time.

Is one of the weapons that prohibits most players in late game arena circles to even dare peek out of their boxes without the risk of a  pesky sniper looking at them (Which I think is BS)

Ive died a lot to heavy snipers in competitive arena then I have to assualt rifles at this point.

its super frustrating how a gun can one shot and you are dependent on having more then 150 health/shield just to survive it...

&amp;#x200B;

Now the return of the drum gun with no pump to counter it, and the introduction of slipstreams allowing you to drop in anywhere on the map in under a minute both promote extremely aggressive play.

The obvious thing would be remove those things, but the community voted on the drum gun and slipstreams  are the big new thing this season, so neither are going anywhere.

So I suggest to avoid unhealthy aggression they add a mechanic where on each kill you gain you lose 50 health/shield and 50 of each mat. To make this fair they could make it so that the leech can only drop you to 1hp if you have less than 50hp.

TLDR; Siphon was removed due to unhealthy aggression, new meta is very aggressive, bring in the opposite of siphon to stop people fighting.",FortNiteBR

I know no one cares, just want to get this off my chest because I've been playing FNBR since day 1 and never wanted to quit as much as I do now.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue with EPIC is the act as if they don't learn. How many times are we going to get big updates where POIs don't load in? I recall this happening at least 2-3 times already. 

I know this is controversial but come on... Why take out the pump? You complain they were 26% of kills yet the drumgun is literally 80% or more? 

We had a spray meta a couple of seasons ago, everyone complained about it and EPIC being EPIC acted slowly but got it changed... Now we're back to another spray meta? I don't get it. 

Late game zones without a pump feel rubbish. 

Combat shotgun barely does damage, has firing issues and etc..

Trees still need to be changed, how they have the same shit hitboxes from day 1 is astonishing. 

Not to mention siphon, material farming and so much more.. Anyways, I promised as per title this would be short but quickly found myself flooding with things to say so I'm going to leave it as half done as this.

When up on high ground scanning the horizon he's usually the first to be spotted, which then sells out his teammate who we might've missed otherwise. Don't even get me started on night-time. It would've been an ideal skin for keeping to the shadows, except for the bright Christmas parade announcing 'HEY EVERYONE I'M OVER HERE LOOK AT ME I GOT TO TIER 70'

Also, there was the idea about SBMM, which most of the community disliked, but why not just add a ranking system the way it is in H1Z1? Pretty much just a picture next to your name which doesn't change in any way who you play against, just gives you an idea of how good/bad your enemy is when you kill him or die to him.

While in build mode with this setup, there’s no way to exit being in the crouched position, and this has lead to me dying quite a few times because I’m trying to run while building but not being able to. What used to happen before an update somewhat recently was entering build mode would automatically take you out of the crouched position. Because of this, I think it would be useful if (at least on console) EPIC added a slider in the options menu to have the game exit crouch when you enter build mode. It would be nice to know if others are on the same page as me.",FortNiteBR

I’m not the best obviously I would humbly grade myself as OK. Some people can build on command much faster to block certain shots. I usually know what’s coming though and my intuition and instincts are there. Nowadays If I’m playing solo or squad I will die to a shotgun pump or tat. Usually I get one shot by the shotgun 100/100 it doesn’t matter(BROKEN) idc how you slice it. The range and damage is ridiculous. Wether I use it against people or people use it on me I’m not a fan of it. Now like I said I’m not the greatest defending against it so this isn’t Just me blaming the game for my “failures” I’m honest that is my real weakness. But I think it’s pretty telling that the shotgun is HEAVILY relied upon no matter the distance no matter the situation. Tell me guys.. how many times have you been shooting someone with an AR or mid range weapon and people rush you build up and shotgun. They could be in Antarctica and rush you with a shotgun. BUT I’ve tried something new today. When I was playing solo people kept building up to me to close the distance and shotgun me. If possible I run away and build and build and build keep the distance and keep ARing. I’ve found that most players who resort to rushing and using the shotgun can’t handle this and will keep rushing no matter what until they die or close the gap. By then I’ve pretty much have killed then. Call it cowardly but it’s kept me alive a lot more times and kept me from getting angry especially when you play for 15 minutes only to get one banged while 100/100. I choose to keep my distance if I can at all times and don’t even touch the shotgun unless I don’t have a gun at all. I’m asking epic.. nerf this gun lol,FortNiteBR

I've posted about this issue before with no real response or many up-votes although it seems to be a issue for many PS4 players. Just a little recap: Fortnite on the older PS4 seems to be extremely laggy or at some points even freezing completely for a second or two whenever landing, shooting, farming materials, etc. Since I first discovered this issue I decided to turn off the ""60 fps"" option in the setting menu. Although I want to play with 60 fps I settled with it off because it seemed to take away the freezing completely. However, the last few day it has been happening again and its pretty damn annoying. As I am landing somewhere the game will freeze and suddenly ill appear somewhere completely different than I intended to land, or while im fighting some it will freeze and I will turn out dead. Now that turning off the 60 fps solution does not seem to be working anymore, I'm not sure what to do. Just because I, or we, are using an ""older"" PS4, this sort of problem should not be happening. The game was made for this console, I shouldn't have to purchase a PS4 pro just to play Fortnite. Please give this an up-vote if you are also experiencing this issue.",FortNiteBR

Not even a word from the devs since then.

Here is another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/72m3cr/over_the_shoulder_important/) from 5 m onths(!) ago, where the discussion and importance about this has gotten some momentum.

To explain what it does, it simply allows you to change the crosshair position from right to left and back again, and allows you to smoothly adjust to corners and you are not forced to work around the left side disadvantage like it is now.

Of course you can adapt and the building system is a very good at that, but still in a 3RD PERSON ONLY game, the movement system is gimped without this feature, especially if it's a competetive game!

A few examples of games which use this feature: APB: Reloaded, Warframe, Battlefront 2, Max Payne 3, Mass Effect: Andromeda, Tomb Raider 2013. So the list is long and the most highprofile of them all, Fortnite, lacks it.

I played hundreds of hours APB: Reloaded, Shoulder Camera Swap was like bread and butter there, a much smoother gameplay flow and no left side disadvantage.

-------

Maybe the different platforms are a problem? I can imagine its more difficult to use it smoothly on a controller or now in the mobile version.

Anyways i hope to see some updates from the devs about this, i know it's in the FAQ, but they only say it's a topconcern, but no words since then.

Can we get some Shoulder Swap supporters in here to get some attention on this topic? That would be friggen fantastic!

Fortnite has stricken a chord with so many people, especially casual gamers. The reason this is true is because people feel like they can actually do something without having to have pinpoint aim. If we made the aim into a PUBG like system, many casual gamers would be taken aback from the game and possibly quit because they may feel they aren’t good enough at it.

But now that I have a scuf. Left paddle is jump and I haven’t been playing nearly as good as I was. I also do not feel like I have improved much either in these 3 days. It feels very awkward specifically with the left portion of the control.

211,bgny,1521253481,850udz,20,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/850udz/strategies_for_stealthy_players/,30,Strategies for Stealthy Players,"You do not need to be a killing machine to get wins.  Be the bane of aggressive players everywhere with these strategies to help you get more wins the stealthy way.

* **Running towards the circle is the most dangerous part of the game for a stealthy player.**  

 It would be nice to have the eye of the storm fall on you every time, but that is not likely to happen.  Use the map to determine the safest routes to approach the circle away from populated areas.  Move towards the back of the circle so the ocean is behind you.  Run towards the circle late, to lessen the chance of people behind you.  Learn when you can outrun the storm. Be patient, you can be late for the first circle and not lose much health.  Run towards structures and hills or mountains so you have cover when you exit the storm.

* **Don't build a big base in the endgame.**  

 You do not want to draw attention to yourself, good players are the ones that will push your base to get your loot.  Stay on the ground using any cover in the area while moving around.  

* **Move into POI and forests in the endgame.** 

 Structures and trees offer lots of cover and offer more ways to escape.

* **Do not trap yourself in a structure**, always have an escape route.  

* **Materials and building are still very important** for a stealthy player. 

 You will need building materials to build cover for yourself when you are shot at, build decoys, climb mountains, and to cover escapes. Farm stealthily in forests or inside buildings. Try to build decoy bases on slopes, build a door in back of the base away from opponents to exit and escape using the hill as cover.  

* **Drops are important to stealthy players.**  

 Since you will probably not be getting your good loot from other players, drops are important.  You are more likely to get the later drops rather than the first ones. You can sometimes find untouched drops outside the circle right before the storm starts moving.  Spot drops in the air and move towards the ones at the edge of the circle.  Even if you don't get there first you may be able to kill whoever is looting it.

* **Take advantage of late game fights.**  

 This is the biggest mistake I see stealth players make.  When there are only a few players left and you have remained hidden until the last players start fighting, YOU MUST PUSH, as this is your best chance to win the game.  If you wait you will most likely be out-gunned against a high kill player.  Get eyes on the last fighting players.  Try to spot the better player and double team him.  Or wait until one is killed and open up on him right away before can recover or build.  The player who won the fight will most likely want to heal and loot.  Keep pressure on him so he can't.

* **Bushes are good to reach the end game but will not get you the win**.  
 Do not rely on the bush to get you close to the last player.  A good one will spot you quickly.  

* **Use smoke.**
Most people leave smoke on the ground.  As a stealth player smoke is a great tool to cover escapes and flank.

* **If you find yourself in a in a 1v1 for the win build a decoy and try to flank your opponent.**  

 On a flank a sniper rifle is your best bet for a one shot kill to win.  A grenade launcher is your second best friend in this situation.  They are harder to predict than RPG rockets and it is easier to get your opponent trying to avoid grenades rather than shooting at you. 

* **A note on C4**
 
  In certain occasions you may be able to sneak up to a base, usually while the player has his attention on someone else.  With the addition of C4 explosives it is much easier to knock down these buildings stealthily and kill the occupants with fall damage. 

**I hope these you can use these strategies for more wins in Fortnite.**

Remember stealth and ""camping"" are a legitamate way to play Fortnite. Some people have certain disabilities, conditions, and even age that prevents them from playing in certain ways. Do not be pressured and shamed into being an aggressive maniac when your skills and weaknesses are not suited for that playstyle. These strategies still take skill to execute successfully.

I am new to reddit, so this post is probably longer than it should have been.  I apologize.  Besides, I am still jacked up from winning my first solo game!


To everybody that is struggling with getting their first win or just with the game in general, take heart.  If I can win, then you can win.  Keep at it; you can do this.  Just remember that the main thing is to have fun.  Winning will come, either through skill or luck or a bit of both.

**Why I am worse than you:**

* I am 48 years old.  This means that my reflexes are slow, my eyesight is bad and it takes me forever to build muscle memory.  Growing old really sucks.
* The last console I owned was an Atari 2600.  No joke…for real.  I got my son an Xbox for Christmas and we have been playing Fortnite almost non-stop.  He, BTW, is 14 and has owned an Xbox and PS3.  We have played many other games together, but not enough for me to really get used to the controllers.  And other FPS games for console would give me a headache, so I couldn't play for long.
* When I first started playing Fortnite, all I could see was the sky and the ground.  If you ever ran across a player that was running around staring at the ceiling and then started to shoot his feet….there is a good chance that was me.  Thank you all who took pity on me and just let me live, knowing that I was no real danger to them.  This actually happened a couple of times, even when I had a gun!
* When I started to build, it was a nightmare.  My fingers just would not do what I told them to do.  So many times, I would be shot just standing there, staring at a blueprint, while my opponent would come across the map to headshot me with a shotgun.  After I got a little better, I could only panic build.  I would try to build a simple wall and a ramp, but instead, out would come a wall facing the wrong direction, a useless attached roof, a roof on the ground and a floor piece next to it.  Needless to say, the opponent would again come across the map to headshot me with a shotgun.  I loathe those roof and floor pieces.
* When I heard that landing at Tilted would help me with my shooting, I tried it.  But it didn't help me much because I would usually get killed before I even got a shot off.  I just became target practice and youtube fodder for everybody else that landed there.  There were even a few times that I ran into unarmed people that pickaxed me to death, because I ran out of ammo trying to hit them while they bunny hopped all around me.
* Right now, I am learning how to rush bases and you can't imagine the number of times I have built that 2 wide ramp to the enemy crow's nest, only to jump in holding nothing but a blueprint and a pencil.  I am getting a lot of shotgun shots to my head for my troubles.

Even with all of that, I still love this game.  It is the perfect balance of combat simulation and campy arcade.  Those small victories of getting a kill or outmaneuvering an opponent keep me going.  And it gives me and my son another thing to bond over.

**How I got my first win (it was mostly luck):**

* I landed where I usually do, on the edge of the map so that I can have chance of gearing up.
* I tried to pick fights where I thought I could win, but something always happened where either I or the opponent disengaged (ran away is another way to put it).
* I rushed one base, didn't hit the guy with a single shot, but he panicked, fell off and died.
* At around 12 people left, I rushed another base and he jumped out as I was building up.  I think he was chasing loot from a kill that he just made.  I couldn't find him and he never returned.
* I was in the base looking for someone to shoot, but really didn't see anybody.
* All of a sudden, I look up and see there are only 2 people left.  My mind is racing, my heart is pumping so hard I thought it would pop out from my chest and my hands are instantly sweaty.
* Me and the other guy get into an AR fire fight where I have the high ground.
* I took 201 damage that game and doled out 183 to opponents.
* I ended up with 1 kill….the last one, the most important kill of all.  :)

I am writing this post to encourage all of the players that are struggling to not get discouraged and keep at it.  You are most likely better than me when I first started and probably better than me after the same number of games played.  If I can get lucky and win, then you can get lucky and win.  Moreover, the game isn't only about winning.  The odds are stacked way against you…99 to 1.  Just go out there…get as many kills as possible, be as aggressive as your skills allows, push yourself to get better so that you can be more aggressive and most importantly, have fun!

In case you are interested, my son first win was after about 200 games.  It took me quite a bit longer.  :)

**EPIC**:  If you made it this far, thank you.  Players like me are another reason that we feel that you should make a practice area.  When I was really bad, I would sometimes get in 20-25 games in an hour because I would die within a few seconds.  Then it is back to the lobby, get into another game, get killed instantly and then repeat the cycle.  A practice area would make the game so much more enjoyable.  When I was getting 25 games in, most of that time was spent in lobby, spawn island and waiting for a game to start, not actually playing the game.

**TL;DR Don't get discouraged.  You are better than me.  The game is about having fun, not winning.  Epic should really make a practice area.**

For whatever asinine reason, you can't manually remove a linked playsation account from your Epic account, but Epic's customer service is virtually non-existent.

I charged back the purchases, removed my card, changed my password, and added 2-step authentication, but the PlayStation still has complete access to my account.

Again, I have no idea what to do since Epic won't do anything themselves. What should I do? Please upvote for visibility, I actually have no other options.

At this point, I wouldn’t even mind the account being nuked. I just don’t want this guy to have it.

Edit: They also just changed my display name to theirs, so I am now Cxnnxr-x till the 30th. Cool stuff Epic",FortNiteBR

My name is Janek alias JaneKay and I've been playing competitive games since the launch of Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I always was interested in the competitve aspect of the games (League of Legends, CS:GO, Fortnite) such as analysing gameplay, decision making and certain tactics. I'm not a pro player but I think I have a decent understanding of these games.
I really wanna try to coach/analyse diffrent gameplays from players since I really enjoy discussing what mistakes people (myself included) did, what other options you had and what you maybe could've done better. There's always room for improvement! ^_^
The whole thing would be put into a YouTube video so you can watch it whenever you want.
As I said I'm not a pro player and definitly can/have to learn many things too but it would really mean a lot to me if maybe 1 or 2 people would send me a gameplay which I can analyse, find/discuss mistakes etc.
If so please fill out my form: https://goo.gl/forms/G9N8TBuPJE825ui83

Happy gaming and good luck in your future games!",FortNiteBR

Some of these posts even mention that access to other high-end weapons or an abundance of ammo feels unfair to play against. The reason that these items feel unfair to play against is because items in this game are found randomly. The line of reasoning being, ""Why should my opponent have an advantage just because he got lucky?""

Although I agree that these high-end items do grant the user an advantage in the late game, I don't think that it is necessarily a bad thing. On the opposite, I think that they are an essential part of what makes each match so rewarding to play.

Due to the fact that items are found randomly throughout the map, most players will not come across a perfect load-out on their own.  In order to increase the likelihood of reaching the late-game with a stacked inventory, it is often necessary to kill a lot of other players and take their loot. Therefore, on average, the players with the best loot at the end of the match are the players with the most kills. The game statistically favors players who are able to use their game knowledge/skill to reach the late-game. 

One of the most appealing qualities of the battle royale game mechanic is that anyone can win. We've all seen matches won by a bush camper with 1 kill, or sometimes even 0 kills. The very real possibility for victory is the appeal that keeps new and inexperienced players queuing match after match. However, the game cannot be completely random and still maintain a sustainable player base, or any kind of competitive environment. With enough caution, it is fairly easy to reach the top 10 of any Fortnite match, but the advantage should always be in favor of the players who really earned their way there. Sorry for the ramble, just my train of thought. 

TLDR: Although anyone can get lucky and find a good weapon, players with high kill counts are more likely to have them in the late-game. The game rewards skill.

I have never played the game so much when Snipers Only, Shooting Test 1, and when Golden Guns existed. Teams of 20 was great too, but still could use improvement. The thing is, there should always be at least 1 LTM active at once. There was no reason to take off Teams of 20, when everyone was enjoying it! Please rotate them in cycles. This is something League of Legends is horrible at. When I played it in my prime there was this LTM out called URF. When URF was out, there was always a huge spike of player hours going up, because poeple love it that much. Basically what that company did to that LTM was they took it away entirly, basically explaining they did not want people to just get on their game to play that LTM, then to leave when it stopped. I am being serious, just look it up. Having downtimes for LTM's just takes away that little bit extra of fun you can have on this game. I can understand you might want to rework them a little better, so yeah then just put another LTM active when you work on the others.

My kill count is abysmal and honestly they are all from really lucky shots. 

I try both flying into a quieter area and gathering some supplies. I can make it into the top 20 but only if I manage to never encounter another player. 

I also try flying into more populated areas so I can improve my combat skills quickly. But I lose EVERY fight. 

It feels like I almost certainly am doing something wrong. Even in situations where I’m stalking someone out who has no idea I’m there, they’ll run in front of me and I’ll fire and somehow they still manage to kill me first. 

I’ve read tons of guides on the game on various different topics from leveling up, the types of weapons etc. But so far haven’t seen anything about simply not being able to land enough shots on other players to get a kill.

Some of which looks like the following.

``` -high -malloc=system -USEALLAVAILABLECORES -nomansky +mat_antialias 0 ```

Needless to say only one of those arguments actually works with the Unreal Engine. So here's a list of actual supported command line arguments for Unreal Engine.

https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Programming/Basics/CommandLineArguments#user

- NOHOMEDIR: Override use of My Documents folder as home directory.
- NOFORCEFEEDBACK: Disable force feedback in the engine.
- NOSOUND: Disable any sound output from the engine.
- NOSPLASH: Disable use of splash image when loading game.
- NOTEXTURESTREAMING: Disable texture streaming. Highest quality textures are always loaded.
- ONETHREAD: Run the engine using a single thread instead of multi-threading.
- PATHS: Set what paths to use for testing wrangled content. Not used for shipping releases.
- PREFERREDPROCESSOR: Set the thread affinity for a specific processor.
- USEALLAVAILABLECORES: Force the use of all available cores on the target platform.

The only one worth actually using is ""USEALLAVAILABLECORES"". Which I have noticed around a 5-10 FPS improvement while doing so. You may also use ""NOTEXTURESTREAMING"" if you have a GPU with a lot of VRAM to see if it will actually load all of the highest quality textures directly into VRAM (this would help improve performance if the argument actually works due to not streaming textures which is a very costly process). Otherwise, everything else that you see (e.g. ""-high -malloc=system -nomansky +mat_antialias 0"") is useless and could impact game stability.",FortNiteBR

We all know Epic is working on bugs, additional items, more cosmetics, a ranked mode of some sort, and better stats.  Those are all well and good but there's something else Epic could be (should be) working on...

Soft objectives.

Allow me to explain.  I think Epic would agree that they want fighting in Anarchy to feel different than fighting in Fatal.  Here's how they do that.

You give a few named locations unique benefits that impact just that location.

Example:  Create a Science Center that contains a building/satellite that casts a shield over time effect to everyone within a certain radius.  Maybe 1hp shield every 1 second?  You could buff/nerf this effect as needed.  If you're close to the satelite, your shield grows.  Leave the radius, and you leave with whatever your shield grew to.

Perhaps this Shield Satellite could be destroyed by selfish players who already have 100 shield?  Perhaps your squad is 2 minutes away from this place, but you guys have no shields so you say ""Hey, let's head over to the Science Center and check out if the Shield Satellite is still working?""

Example 2:  A military Base with a working Radar building.  The radar building has a terminal you walk up to where you can hold square, and a pulse goes out over the map taking a snapshot of all enemy locations within a certain radius.  Maybe the radar terminal only charges up 1 pulse every 90 seconds so players can't abuse it.

This would give more flavor to each location and would make traveling/fighting there more interesting and unique.

Why make another map when Epic can just make this map more interesting?",FortNiteBR

In it, he ended 1v1 as one of the last two players in the game. The other player got a little lucky, and the fort they built remained in the circle throughout the the round. That player proceeded to ""spam"" the Rocket Launcher until eventually my brother's friend succumbed to its explosive power 

This morning, he was arguing that that player won a ""trash win"", an ""unskilled win"", ""not a real win"", etc. He further argued that *any* skilled player would agree with him that using the Rocket Launcher in a 1v1 setting that wasn't for the express purpose of base destruction and nothing else was a poor way of winning the game, or that a *real* player would charge in at the enemy with a Assault Rifle/Shotgun and fight ""fairly"". 

So, I ask you, r/fortnitebr, is he right? Or is he wrong?

""Ok but now you're manipulating my wording

By the end of season 2 I felt pretty much unstoppable in solos and was winning 30%+ of my matches, and even more than that in the other modes, now I'm lucky if I can win 10-15% of my matches in solos and 20% in the other modes. At first I thought I was just somehow getting worse, but a few days ago I remembered the patch notes from the start of season 3 mentioning SBMM, and upon playing more I started to realise that 90% of players in my lobbies are rocking paid skins and most have really solid building and aiming skills, pretty much it feels like every lobby now is a sweat fest and I really have to earn almost every kill, let alone a win. I’ve mentioned this to some of my friends and they feel the same way. 

I’m all for SBMM is a separate ranked playlist, but having to be at my A-game every normal match is quite draining, and sucks the fun out of the game. I know people are going to counter by saying that the player base just got better, but there is no way they improved that much on average in such a short period of time. 

For reference I’m on PS4 with well above average [stats]( https://www.stormshield.one/pvp/stats/ryanjt761-#) so if you’re more of an average player your experience might have been different to mine. Anyone else experiencing this?",FortNiteBR

I want to link my accounts so I can keep my battle pass and skins from my Xbox account and use that profile on pc. What is the best way to do this?

I'm sure many are aware how annoying it is to see someone just spam walls or ramps to avoid being hit.

Well many of my friends agree upon a build meter mechanic possibly being added. Here is an idea of how it could work.


Build meter: (example - not final)

- each building piece adds a percentage to your total build meter. (100bm)
- each piece could add 10% and would decrease 10% every second.
- if you build 10 walls super fast then you will have to wait 10 seconds to build.
- building would require timing and strategy rather than mindless spamming

These statistics are just examples of how it could prevent spam building. If you guys have your own numbers plz share :)",FortNiteBR

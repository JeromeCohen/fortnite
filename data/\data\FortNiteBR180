The whole dynamic of the game changed, being used to playing 130-150ping the game played out so differently at lower pings. 

At the beginning of them introducing the server 2 out of 10 games would be low ping. Which was very difficult because the game plays so differently at both pings (ie 150 and 60) lag spikes, shots not registering, people phasing through builds these are just some problems at high pings. But honestly, you learn to play and get used to it. I won a lot of games at high ping games as well. On the other side is the low ping not knowing when to peak, gameplay being fast, over building, these are a few problems at low pings for people coming from high pings. It doesn't let one improve because we can't get used to one ping, sounds stupid but I was actually getting good at the game at 150ping because I was getting used to it but finding one game which is high and the next being low doesn't help. Just imagine the trouble of having to leaving every game because you can't get a low ping game then waiting in the lobby for another few minutes for the matchmaking just to find another high ping game. The whole process takes about 2-3minutes, having to do that almost every game is really frustrating. The low ping games are just so much more better to play that I'd actually not mind waiting 2mins for matchmaking but the whole process of finding, quitting, waiting is taxing. 

The state changed, after a while it was rarely high ping games 8/10 games became low ping, and I got really good at the game I learnt to play on low ping and got really better. The game was fun, having to quit one or two games here and there was fine. A frequent problem we faced was that after every update, we wouldn't be a to get low ping games. After at least 5-6 hours, fair enough. It's understandable that the servers are on pressure and what not so it wasn't that big of a deal. 


Then comes the fortnitemare update, and trust me it's been a nitemare. After them disabling sub region matchmaking 2/15 games became low ping. It's been 4 days since the update came out. It's just pure frustration that we can't enjoy the update like everyone else is,there are no low ping games. I played 2 games in a span of 45 mins because I couldn't seem to find low ping games. Epic. Please do something about this. I'm sure there are a lot many SEA players who feel the same way. There was a comment by someone at epic who said the sub region was switched back on, but it's been 4 days and I can't seem to find consistent low ping games. 

Couple of solutions which came to my mind were 
1) Give an option 
a) Longer matchmaking times but low ping 
b) quick matchmaking but ping can be random 

2) isolate the SEA server, don't route the ones who pick this server to Tokyo servers.

Since Friday I've noticed that a few others and myself have been quite disappointed with the re-release of the Reaper harvesting tool.

Being released again, and in the wake of Skull Trooper's re-release -- which came with an additional selectable style for those who purchased it last year, it feels odd not seeing the Reaper getting a similar treatment as this harvesting tool was in shop at the same time as Skull Trooper last year and since has become a highly sought after item.

Not only that, but at the time it was originally sold, the game was very fresh and it was therefor unclear how much the item descriptions meant, below is the description of the Reaper:

*""Harvest resources... and souls with the limited edition reaper pickaxe.""*

Of Skull Trooper, Ghoul Trooper and Reaper, this was the only item of the three for which it said *limited edition*, which is why I, and presumably others too, only purchased the harvesting tool as most other online games tend to re-release holiday event skins annually.

Which is why I suggest [**this**](https://i.imgur.com/0G7P1rj.png) subtle tweak to the Reaper's texture so it can also match the Skull Trooper for those who purchased him last year.

I merely want to put this out there as I feel that I missed out on an *era* of Fortnite Battle Royale's history by purchasing the harvesting tool instead of Skull Trooper and hope we can keep a clean discussion in the comment section (with no heads rolling).

We get that, but there are tons of these posts, support the original post.. Epic will see it easier and be able to address it quicker.

The cube stones don‚Äôt intentionally spawn on you, they also don‚Äôt need to be posted every time it happens. These have had quite a bit of light shed on them, I‚Äôm sure Epic is preparing some sort of fix as quickly as possible.

Your cam rotation bug video/picture isn‚Äôt going to help Epic fix the problem any quicker, so try to avoid the thing the thing that causes the bug. It seems to be a isolated incident, so they‚Äôre already on the case.

The Redeploy Glider is probably one of the best additions in quite some time, even in an addition ridden Fortnite. Not only is this going to deter 3rd partiers, build fights are finally viable again and completely safe to do in Pub matches. I also feel like this addition was added due to all the problems with vehicles added to the Fortnite Universe. When it shoots you out into space you can jump off if you have the opportunity to do so before it‚Äôs too late, and not die..

Stop posting the multiple Llamas, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just Karma Whoring at this point, but I would rather see a pre lobby dance group 10,000 times then another freaking Llama post.. for the love of god it‚Äôs RNG. It‚Äôs going to happen, and it happens all the time.

This subreddit is getting out of hand with Reposts, we need to be more focused on getting the problem fixed and not being the ones getting attention for it. Use the search button, look and see if someone has already posted about the same thing you‚Äôre posting.. if they have support their post.

TL;DR: This Subreddit is getting out of hand with reposts whether it‚Äôs because of karma whoring or just blatant ignorance, we need to stop posting things that are already posted and instead start helping each other with their posts, this will allow Epic to find these things quicker and fix them faster.

Well tonight I'm playing duos with a friend.  My friend died, but there is 3 people left (including me), and I can't find these two dudes at all.  The circle is closing in and I look up, these two guys are just skybasing and there's really nothing I could do because they built the portion leading up to it with numerous pieces, and most of it was out of range for me to even hit with any gun (including my heavy sniper).

Even if I could knock it down, they'd just glide down.  This is stupid.  There is a reason people bitched about skyboxing in the past and why it has become a nearly completely useless tactic, or at least, I never see it being used.  But with the new update, since your hand is held at all times and who cares if you build up real high only to have your shit knocked down because now you can never take fall damage, it's yet another new thing that annoys the shit out of me about this recent update.

Please tell me that there is a god and that Epic didn't decide to implement this change as a permanent thing.",FortNiteBR

The bullet holes will be all over the wall, most of which went outside the crosshair.

How do you get your bullets to go to the middle of the crosshair in CS? Be still...

Albeit, there's a method with strafing where you can shoot IN BETWEEN strafing from left to right. There's a split second of time where you're not moving and when you shoot, your shot will be pretty right on. But the idea is still that if you're moving, your shots wont be on the crosshair...

No one complains about it.

Everyone blames bloom for not hitting things. So make use of first shot accuracy? Stop whining. The people blaming bloom for their downfalls would not have a very good time in Counter-Strike.",FortNiteBR

Pretty much every other weapon in the game is better than a shotgun (unless it's the tactical shotgun or the double barrel). My suggestion for a rework could be a good solution for the shotguns not being reliable. Pump Shotgun: Damage increase by 5, however range isn't as great as the Heavy
Tactical Shotgun: Increase of Firerate, however 5 damage decrease
Heavy Shotgun: Damage isn't changed, however, longer range before drop-off
Double Barrel: Potential Damage is increased to 125/130 body, 178/190 Headshot, but the range is slightly increased, however, drop-off is more severe.

#This weeks topic is: **Explosives**

We would like to set specific focused feedback on explosives to base your conversation on, potential talking points are:

* What about the explosive weapons are working well?
* How would reducing or increasing the ammo capacity affect their power and is the ammo in a good state already?
* Should explosives be able to impact building the way they do now or should it be adjusted to destroy more/less building?
* Should the reload times of the explosive weapons be adjusted in any way?
* Do you think the projectile spread be should be changed to make weapons like the RPG and Quad launcher more/less accurate?
* Should the drop rate and ways explosive weapons can be acquired be adjusted and if so how much?
* Should the weapon be kept the same with no additional changes?

We would like to set specific focused feedback points on the Minigun to base your conversation on, potential talking points are:

* What about the Minigun is working well?
* Would limiting the Minigun to specific game modes such as duos/squads have an affect on its power?
* Would the Minigun be better/worse if it limits your movement speed?
* Would introducing a cool-down feature to the gun make the gun more balanced and how often should this be?

That's why a test dummy could help you plan your strategy for each weapon. You could place them in high spots and practice trickshots or place them in 1x1s with windows and  try to get grenades through the window. Also, the test dummies should have a damage indicator, just like the one that pops up when you harm an enemy, so you can know which weapons deal what damage without having to check the wiki or having to wait until some of your friends get online. 

And just in case someone's wondering, they would be placed just like floor traps.",FortNiteBR

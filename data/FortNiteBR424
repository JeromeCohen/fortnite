But the bushes in this game are stupid over powered right now. It's gotten to the point that winning without bush hiding is almost impossible. If you want to win then you best chances are hiding to the last couple guys, and hiding in a bush near or in the circle. Unless your opponent has the ammo and balls to shoot every bush, you've lost. And unless they shoot your bush first, now you know where they are and they don't know where you are. Bushes provide a massive unfair and unimaginative advantage in a game that's designed around being imaginative in your playstyle. I don't want them removed, but make them a lot shorter so you cannot get full body coverage. This game excels when it's fast paced, and bushes destroy any pace the endgame has and turns it into circle rng meets hide and seek.",FortNiteBR

Another key note I'd like to mention here:
&gt; The mouse is not held in the center of the screen, when you open the inventory it's disorienting - your mouse will be somewhere within the bounds of the client based on where you previously aimed.

I think this is silly, as there's no way to really know where your mouse will be, you can't interact with your inventory as consistently as you would be able to if the mouse was kept in the center of the game window like most other games.

Needless to say it didn't go according to plan but I'm still not sure how I didn't get this guy. A few seconds before this I had dinged the dude for about 32 damage with my scar.

Now what I'm curious about is how the game decides who dies first in these situations. Is it because he had more HP + some shield remaining so he is left unscathed or if two targets of equal health were in the same situation would the attacker simply die first?

Lemme know what you guys think :)

Fact is that the skins are a bit overpriced but I understand the price but in other games like league (free game) the skins are better in quality and less expensive.

As for me I’m using the standard PS4 edition and the update was wonderful for me. First few games were off because of the reworked aiming mechanics (making it more responsive etc) and Me and my mates had to figure out our perfect sensitivity settings again 

But god damn it the game is so smooth for me now. No lags at all anymore. No skipping. No freezing

It is especially noticeable when jumping out of the bus. It’s just so damn smooth and responsive. No lags. No delay. Just a really smooth experience 



Edit 1) I also think they toned down the auto assist help a whole lot. Which leads to the sensitivity drama as well. It feels like the aiming doesn’t get slowed down as much as it did before IMO, I could be wrong though. Played with 100 ads sens before and toned that down to 0.85 now

The quality of life changes have been terrific and the addition of cosmetics, despite their high price is great. It's a free game, as developers you have been consistently updating the game therefore I have no problem dishing out some money for cosmetics. 

However, the sensitivity changes are confusing. Snipers seem to be extremely slow when ADS even at the highest setting, very hard to track targets. The most frustrating change is the locked 30 fps. In a battle royal, especially with this one, engagements need to be smooth and the cap is hindering that significantly. Clunky movement and close quarter shotgun fights tough on the eyes. Hopefully more will be done to return to a 60fps experience.

The reason I am disappointed is when a free to play game sells items that are unavailable for free players to obtain(regardless of advantage). Over the years this has become common and people are used to it and see it as ok.  I however do not.  The principle of the matter is that a free to play game should be able to be played and fully obtain everything the game has to offer, which the two new (badass looking mind you) skins are not unless you buy Vbucks, or buy the game and grind.  I am not a fan of any practice of this sort, whether it is minimal or extreme.  Now, for those of you that say ""cough up you cheap shit"", my reply to that is no, the game chose the free to play path, not me.  I had no problem spending near 600 bucks buying the switch just for one game.  The principle is what matters, not money.",FortNiteBR

However i am a bit disappointed with the skin pricing.   1 skin is like 1200 coins i think and it costs $10 for just 1000 coins.   So for $10 i can't get a skin and would end up having to pay $20+ just to get a skin.   I know you guys need to make money somehow with all the time and effort you put into this game, but i feel you would sell more skins in the long run if you lowered the price a bit in my opinion.   I played about 5-7 games so far today and have yet to see someone with a new skin on ps4.   What do you guys think a fair price for a skin should be?   In my personal opinion i think $5 skins would be fair for both parties, or at the very least make skins available for 1000 coins ($10).  I think $10 is a lil too steep of a price for 1 skin, but it would be better than having to pay $20+ just to get a skin.   Battle royale seems to be very popular at the moment and i think you're missing out on a lot of potential sales in my opinion.   

These are just my thoughts and i hope it doesn't seem like i am bashing the developers because i love the work they have done.

The first thing that I noticed was the weekly leader boards which I thought was a great idea! After that I tried to find regular leader boards for all time stats and wins but it was no where to be found?
After that I investigated the shop and to my surprise buying 100$ worth of tokens can only get you on average, 8 Skins. 100$ for 8 Skins!! For example League of legends with 100 dollars you can get on average 15 skins which is almost double!??


The last thing that I noticed was the nature of there character customization. What a crap bare bones system. I was hoping for something closer to that of H1Z1 where I can change every aspect, helmet, pants, shirt so on. With this update I would have much rather them wait 4 months and come out with something impressive then this crap.

I'll go through the 4 main methods to earn V-Bucks. (Note you will need to own at least the standard edition pack to access Save the World, currently 40% off.)

&amp;nbsp;

**1. Daily log in bonuses** (100-300 Vb every two weeks)

That's correct you can get V-Bucks just by logging into StW on a daily basis. Obviously this method is rather slow, as it is typically about only once every two weeks that the log in reward is V-bucks and it usually gives you 150 or 300 V-bucks (in my experience).

&amp;nbsp;

**2. StW Daily Quests** (50 Vb per quest, 1 quest per day)

After advancing a little ways into the story you'll unlock these Daily Quests, which you get one per day and can store up to 3. They come in several varieties including:


* Complete 3 of X Type missions


* Complete 3 Missions with X type hero


* Kill 500 husks with X type Hero (to count husks must be hit by you at least once before they are killed)


* Destroy X number of X Object, typically found in X type zone. (Anyone in your game destroying one counts so ask them to smash them in chat)

&amp;nbsp;

**3. Storm Shield Missions** (usually 100 Vb per mission, but these missions are part of the main storyline)

These missions are unlocked by advancing through the main storyline of StW. There are 10 per Zone (though getting to later zones will take a lot of time) for a total of 40, and they can only be completed once (helping someone else with theirs doesn't reward Vb). Side note: you have to get past storm shield defense 6 to unlock the next major zone.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. Challenge Quests** (50 Vb per quest)

There are a number of different challenge quests that you unlock access to at various times by playing through the main story (all are unlocked in Stonewood ,Zone 1, or early Plankerton, Zone 2). All but the rescue survivors one rewards V-Bucks. These challenge quests can be accomplished up to 10 times each, which gives you a large amount of Vb, but then they are gone forever. (It's been so long since I have completed them all I can't recall how many different challenges there are, or what the quests were exactly, but they typically would take several missions to complete.)

&amp;nbsp;

**Bonus Method:  Alert Missions** (Vb varies, but VERY RARE)

Alert Mission are missions that offer extra rewards (indicated by a little clock symbol), these can VERY rarely offer a small amount of Vb as the extra reward (I've seen between 15-30 Vb).

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

I hope this helps some of you get some V-Bucks to get the cosmetic items you want for Battle Royale. If you need help figuring out how StW works I reccomend visiting r/FORTnITE/. Best of Luck!",FortNiteBR

On PS4, we know of these sensitivity issues where EPIC has taken the time to work on the ""Default"" settings in order to make more sense of the console controls. They've increased the ADS to a ridiculous amount and it's taken many games just to even come to close to fixing it. Here's my take on the issue: They're too late. If anyone felt there were issues with the sensitivity the last two or more weeks, they would have changed them by now. You guys had one of the biggest influx of players ever in a game. By changing the default setting, you'd be working towards new players, but how many new players are still to come? Furthermore, in order to change the settings, the options are not intuitive. What is a Gamepad? Why does that change my sensitivity? Provide more in-depth descriptions of what each setting does if you can.

Next is the performance issues. Please uncap the PS4 at 30FPS. Things are laggy. Anytime someone on my team gets into a gunfight, my screen becomes super jittery. Picking up items is super slow when pressing SQUARE, and the item info takes a while to pop up. Walking around, bumping into players, are also issues. Performance does not seem to have been improved.

And that's just from 5-6 games. I've barely been able to make it far because I've spent so much time fixing my settings. There's no place to perfect the settings so I'm out here dying. 

EDIT: Also adding the opening of chests is very laggy.

EDIT 2: Sniper sensitivity is ABSURD. All these guns are different or something, I'm very confused...

It blows me away that so many studios and publishers these days choose to remain cryptic, or revert to awful marketing-speak when dealing with their communities. Those strategies may have worked before the internet took off, but that isn't the case anymore, and 90% of game studios/publishers are still lagging behind the times in that respect.

To be clear, I'm not saying that other devs are bad because they can't fix or add features on almost a weekly basis. The size and skillsets of game dev teams vary wildly from one company to the next, and not every team has the resources to accomplish what EPIC (a massive game studio/publisher) has done with FBR in such a short time. In my opinion, the key factor that has set EPIC's FBR team above the rest is simple communication. They are extremely active on their forums, twitter, and this sub. Valid issues and concerns don't go long without some form of official response, and these days, that's really all gamers ask for from dev studios. More importantly, when EPIC does communicate, it's in plain language.

I bought Fortnite during it's shady beta launch (I, like many others, had no idea it wasn't a complete game at the time), and committed to not spending another dime after experiencing the flawed PvE progression and loot box/paywall antics. The FBR dev team has won me back, so much so that I'm probably going to dive back into the PvE in the near future. More importantly, I now have zero qualms about spending money on the game. Why? Because when developers are this forthcoming and involved in their community, I want my wallet to speak the loudest. If FBR becomes hugely profitable in addition to being hugely popular, perhaps other game studios will finally pull their heads out of their asses to see the right way of interacting with a dedicated game community.

Thanks EPIC FBR Team! &lt;3",FortNiteBR

But... this update that downgrades the experience of Pro players for ‘reasons’ (I know you listed input sensitivity... which never seemed an issue on the pro due to the higher frame rate) and has - and I don’t want to sound hyperbolic - made the game feel worse, slow and weird.  It’s like going from a game of BF1 (not a solid 60 on a pro, I know) to a game like Destiny PVP, you feel it in the worse way.

You REALLY REALLY notice going from an almost 60fps to a solid 30, it’s really apparent. We’re now being given almost 50% less information each frame. 

I do like the game and will remain subscribed to the sub in order to read about updates and changes. Most importantly an update to reversing this FPS decision (or a toggle).

But until then I’m going to shelf it and eagerly hope this is reversed sometime in the near future.",FortNiteBR

Player 1 plays 12 hours per day with 10% winrate and averages 1 kill per match.

Player 2 plays 3 hours per day with 20% winrate and averages 7 kills per match.  

Player 1 is the better player according to the leaderboards because he'll have more wins, but if they were put in the same match, player 2 would win way more often than player 1. See a problem there?

This system only rewards those who are able to put in a ton of hours and those who like to camp and hide, which takes very little skill. The match scoring should be based on both winning and kills (maybe win % too). Everybody knows that the best players are the ones who get really high kill wins consistently. They should be rewarded with a high leaderboard placement instead of someone who just camps in a bush 14 hours a day and only kills the last guy to win the game. 

I'd much prefer something like H1Z1 has, top 10 best match scores where you can see your placement and the amount of kills in each match. That's a much more motivating way to get people to grind. It's not rewarding at all if you get a 20 kill win and it's just one more point in the leaderboards just like every other game. It's really fun and motivating to try and beat your own top 10 scores. It gets extremely boring if every win is worth the same. Why should I care after win number 157 if they're all the same? Where's the challenge? A top 10 match ranking system let's you challenge yourself over and over again and doesn't get old so fast and even your win number 300 can feel really special. 

There should also be leaderboards where you can compete against your whole region, EU, NA etc. Why should I care how I rank amongst 50 randoms? ",FortNiteBR

- Many players (myself included) were previously ready to spend £10 - £20 on this game for some cosmetic bits. Very little incentive was needed to push us to spend, as we love the game.

- As soon as it was apparent that we would essentially get only 1 skin for our £20 of support, that small incentive that we needed to spend some money went out the window due to the value of the 1 skin seeming like a rip off.

- We aren't dumb; skins cost very little to develop and leave in a storefront. 

- We love your game and would happily pay full retail price up front for access to full customisation but the perceived value of 1 SKIN FOR £20 looks like a bad deal, even if we do want to support the game.

You need to make money on this game and it's your business how you want to monetise it, but I'd have paid £2 10 times over without blinking, but £20 for one item seems disingenuously expensive.

Love the game anyway, chaps. Peace. ",FortNiteBR

If I go into squads I want to play with 3 people who want to have a 4th not 3 people who randomly got out with me and just see me as free loot. 

Also, in my personal opinion you should get banned for at least 24hrs for griefing, and it should stack the more you do it.

#1 Im not poor but im not paying for cosmetics... yet... 
So the new update got released and i was expecting those 2 halloween skins and a bunch of other cosmetics as well. There are only 2 options for outfits and they each cost $20. I will buy both soon but still i thought fortnite would throw in more option like maybe a red baseball cap u can put on, on top of an outfit or Create your own outfit with tons of different items. 

#2 Nothing was done to make the true free to play players happy.

So even without buying i was looking forward to cosmetics because i thought they would allow you to choose what character you play as. As you know their are like 4 characters, a blonde hair dude and a mexican guy and 2 other girls. I thought at least we would be able to choose which one we got but its still randomized. 

#3 leaderboards

Leaderboards are great but i want to see how well im doing against the best in the world. After a few hours after release i already got 2 wins and really it doesnt feel competitive when all 49 of my competitors havent even placed in the top 25 yet. 

#4 leaderboards again.

Anyone can win games. Only really skilled players can drop bombs. (high kill games) I personally think the system should be based on your top 10 best games. This takes out the fact of grinding for places. All you need is 10 good wins and youre set. You wont need to grind all season just to stay at the top. It should be based on skill not wins. Everybody wins. 

#5 Recoil???

I think they added recoil... On 1 gun.....

the scar, now seems like it has slight recoil. I honestly dont mind it. But why add it to 1 gun and no others. Not to mention bloom still exists on the scar as well.

EPIC, please allow those of us on console or who prefer to use controllers the full ability to map buttons as we would prefer them. The presets are a great starting point and maybe even endpoint for those who want to just pick from a couple options and learn them, but some of us have played shooters for decades and have become accustomed to certain actions on certain buttons and rely on muscle memory in moments of panic and urgency.

Some have offered the PS4 and XB1 ability to create controller profiles to remap outside of the game, and while that's what I've done for now, it can still get confusing for actions such as jumping, currently the A button on XB1, which is commonly used as the confirm button in menus, also the LB and RB buttons are used to move around in the FNBR menu so if those are manually rebound, we have to remember what we've changed those buttons to simply to move through stats/leaderboards/etc.

Epic its a start and I'm not saying I need loot boxes or a ton of loot right away but I really don't give a single flying fuck about the nameless character models we are forced to play. The skins are nice and all but why would I want to pay this much for them when they are stuck to a preset character that I do no care about?  

It'd be different if the game had characters similar to that of the PVE.

That being said, I think they made a huge mistake by capping the frame rate to 30 fps. I have played quite some games on the new patch and I honestly feel no notable difference regarding game performance other than a little less input lag.

The 30 fps makes it so much harder to spot enemies in the distance and it makes gun fights feel really weird now. I would gladly have the game running at 60 fps even if it would make the game drop fps like it did before this patch.

Why don't they give console players the same option as PC players like turning off shadows and reduce graphic quality so we can still play at 60 fps? Turning off shadows is something they should have gave console players by default if you ask me.

Another big issue I noticed is that the scoped sensitivity is all messed up. I have my normal sens at 0.55 and used 0.9 scoped sensitivity before this patch but now even at 1 scoped sensitivity aiming with a sniper feel really really slow. I can't get it anywhere near the high sensitivity like I'm used to.",FortNiteBR

It's a free game with buyable cosmetics, the best kind of f2p.

Introducing a way to gain free V-Buck in the BR mode will increase for sure the number of people hacking in every match, update after update.

Free V-Bucks, in every form, is a great incentive for these kind of people to create and make use of cheats to get em, at every cost (and BR mode it's f2p at the moment...). 

Do you like matches with aim-botters, wall-hackers and, why not, bots that will ""auto-hide their way till the next bush to the center of the circle"" just to place in the top spots? I dont think so.

With those numbers, Fortnite it's shining right now and it's at center of the attention in its genre: dont give em a cause to cheat, simply.

Support the game throught the store if you like it and want to.

For starters, Great job on the patch guys, you did awesome. 

Finally being able to crouch and rotate my building sections on R is a god send and being able to switch weapons with L1 / R1 feels amazing.

Gameplay and gunplay feels a lot tighter and over all a lot more responsive, especially when moving and strafing. 

Seasons, leaderboards and the other changes you have made are leaps and bounds in the right direction.

My only minor point of contention is the Scoped ADS sensitivity. Having it set to 1, even though it's more than manageable, still feels slightly sluggish when using a sniper and sweeping left or right trying to keep eyes on a moving target. I feel like maybe having an extra 0.10 to 0.15 added onto it at some point would make sweeping whilst scoped feel a lot better. That is just my opinion and in no way me demanding things or trying to speak for the community as a whole.

Congrats once again guys, you knocked it out of the park with this one.

But when Epic released cosmetics into the BR side and made them limited to an event and made them purchase with ingame currency which must be bought or earned in PvE (at a limited rate of 50 per day) it brings doubt on the ethics of Epic.

Had Epic gave us a way to earn in-game currency via FBR I doubt they would be seeing this outrage from the community, also the fact you still cannot select your character but if you purchase a outfit you can stay as that character has also left people confused and irritated.

To put it simply Epic you seem as if your trying to turn what I deemed to be the tribute of old school gaming (Transparent Devs, Frequent Updates, Good Community ect) into a cash cow that needs milking.

I browse this sub and basically never post anything, but today i raised my voice to show epic games what i think about these changes and got heavily attacked. I think both sides have good arguments, but if the side that complains stops forever...guess what that will do to cosmetic prices in future games (this is not the first nor the last time that this topic will be brought up). 

At what point are the people who had nothing to complain about suddenly start complaining too? Whats the limit of your wallets here? Maybe one day we will pay $50+ for a single skin and then everyone is going to ask themselves ""how did we get here?"". I tell you how...first DLC's in every game that should be part of the main game, then early access games that seemed to focus more on releasing skins while barely updating the game (and DLC's in some cases) and now Lootboxes...whats next? It blows my mind how we as the consumers fight each other about things we should stand against while big companies laugh and think about new ways to bend us over.

Yes these companies and people who work on the game need to make their money too because it's free2play, but what makes you guys defend these price points and all the other bullshit we gamers had to deal with for so long so hard? It's always the same arguments with free2play titles, but just because it's free doesn't mean they can charge whatever price they want (would you pay $100 for a skin? Really, where is YOUR limit?). Game devs have been getting away with a lot of bullshit for to long and the only reason there is a small bit of hope are people like me who do say something and not accept everything that comes their way. The Fortnite Epic Games devs seem to be one of the better people out there, but that doesn't mean they can't make mistakes. Just my 2 cents and reminding you where we could end up, no matter how cool the company is that is working on your favorite game (remember that they are never our friends and always go for profit).",FortNiteBR

Currently basing leaderboards soley off wins is NOT a show of skill, more so a show of how much time you can throw ar the game. 

I would like to see a hybrid stat system that incorporates win % with k/d ratios and wins with weighing kills higher than former leaderboards such as PUBG. H1 did a good job on their leaderboards to provide a fast paced game play but it wasn't as rewarding as the depth pubg had. The problem pubg leaderboards imposed was wins were weighted much higher than kills which provokes turtling tactics and playing scared essentially to get a higher placement.

Yes, obviously not everyone can win dozens+ of games, but at the end of the day, the more you grind, the more wins and topX placements you'll accumulate, so what exactly does this come to show? How much time you've had on your hands? That's kind of a buzz kill. It doesn't reflect skill at all (or just slightly - seeing how you do have to be relatively good to end up winning many games). 

IMO, H1Z1 is the worst version of BR, but I'd much rather have their leaderboards system (the total score of 10 of your best games. A win is X point and each kill = +Y points, etc). It shows a lot more and doesn't put the emphasis on grinding.",FortNiteBR

However it's very disappointing to see no Battle Royale V Bucks earning.. I understand it's a free game but would have a been a perfect reward for wins as its not the easiest thing to beat 100 people. This approach to cosmetics just rubs me the wrong way, I get they want people to buy there PvE game but not everyone likes PvE games and couldn't bother wasting time on the PvE game because the adrenaline isn't there with a non competitive playing field. Not to mention the terrible reviews of the PvE game I wouldn't ever want to waste a minute on that. That being said Battle Royal is more then phenomenal and has been a pleasure, but to expect your BR player base to buy a whole other game in order to progress cosmetically is *bullocks*, I'm gladly going to spend some money on this game but I'm thinking $5 and nothing more after seeing how the earning rate is and that there isn't one in BR. but I definitely would have spent more  IRL money on V Bucks if BR players could earn them, cause if it comes out as mentioned it's just gonna be a credit card contest between players for skins and cosmetics with no real good feeling behind having it other then buying it?

This base design makes it so you have EVERY side available to you for peaking. 


It takes me 8 seconds to build this base and that is on console. It would be a lot quicker on a PC and with the new PRO controller layout it may even be quicker. All it takes is practice and you can really abuse this base design in the late game.

Yeah we all know SMG is bad but I still have to make this post anyway. You can skip down to the end part if you don't care about this early stuff.

=
.



AR's = mid to long range, medium dmg bullets, RNG-ish but high ammo clip and usable at any range. Higher rarity = more reliable accuracy. Versatile usability.

=

Shotguns = Close range only. Good with jumping around, doesn't rely on standing still / crouching / aiming down sights for accuracy, and can one to two shot a guy close up if you can land a headshot.

=

Sniper Rifles = long to very long range preferred, very slow shots, worse than pickaxe at close range, but highest range in the game and high damage with one-shot potential. 

=

Revolver = kinda shitty but can be interesting as it is often more reliable accuracy-wise than AR's at medium to long range, and it is harder to identify where the shooter is if there isn't a constant stream of bullets drawing a straight line from their location

=


Grenade Launcher // Rocket Launcher = base or building destruction, AOE damage / spam damage

=

Pistol (a.k.a. semi-auto pistol) = for close to short to medium range. Good at finishing off injured targets. Fires very quickly. Can often be even more deadly than the semi-auto shotgun in close-range combat.

=

.

=

SMG = close range, good at finishing people off,  fires EXTREMELY quickly (10 shots per sec), requires constant target tracking 


=

.


Yes we all know the SMGs kind of suck. But at the same time, most players probably toss revolvers and pistols and never give them a second thought if they manage to get AR/Shotgun. The point of this that [1] revolver/pistol are still quite usable, while [2] the role of the SMG seems to get outshone by the pistol. Pistol is better at close range than SMG, seems to do a bit better heading toward medium range (like 15-25 meters) than SMG, and also finishes people off better than SMG. Additionally, SMG chews through bullets like crazy.

=

.

#Again, the list of problems:
- uses your ammo clip quickly 
- uses up your reserve ammo quickly (can easily lead to 0 bullets)
- is worse than pistol at close range, med range,  far range, and ammo management


=

.

#And some potential ideas on what could be changed to give SMG its own Niche:

- Make it use less ammo. Maybe every 1 ammo = 2 shots come out, or 2 ammo = 3 shots, or that sort of thing. SMG fires so quickly that this would blend seamlessly with the current model.

- Reduce the spread VERY heavily, remove spread on jumping,  but add damage fall-off. This would make it the most reliable gun in the game at finishing injured enemies --- but it would still not be as good as AR's/etc at longer ranges (because of damage falloff).

- Increase the reload speed to be a VERY quick 0.4-0.6 seconds; this would improve the ""dueling"" aspect of this gun. This gun suffers from running out of ammo quickly and does not have the luxury of having too many shots ready for ammo to matter (shotgun) or being long-range enough to duck for cover while reloading (AR's/snipers).

- Reduce the sound VERY heavily so that the SMG can be the first and potentially only ""stealth"" gun that can shoot at players *without* drawing further attention. Other guns suffer from being loud enough to attract other nearby players.",FortNiteBR

I hopped into a game of BR before work, nothing special about this match. As a solo player my plan is the same as always: go wherever the f*ck I want and find some bubblegum to chew. I decide that based on the bus flight path, I'll get a little moisty with it and play in the woods. 

*whoosh*

Here I am flying towards the mire. I know exactly where I'm going well before I jump. That damned triple chest tree. This glorious bastard of a tree has given me everything from multiple legendaries to three white smgs, to not squat, but we always start at this tree because it's a good tree and also an easy 100 wood. As we haul keister approaching the floor, I notice some moron following me around the tree. We both circle the tree with our umbrellas twice and land at the base of the tree simultaneously. 

There is only one spawned chest this round.

Immediately we both start flailing our pickaxes everywhere like this was 2008 and we just found the first Welo opal. After three seconds of this miserable failure, we start to shuffle around the chest, daring the other to open it. We exchange a couple of pickaxes hits eac- 

The chest opens and interrupts my thoughts as well,
And I frantically spam the pick up button and pray that I end up with a weapon.

It's over.

In my inventory lay a white, 3 round burst assault rifle. I had won.
My opponent busts a groove.
Just starts dancing. Knowing that I have just achieved greatness and have hit the absolute highpoint of my life, he had offered a celebration. I retaliate, and we both break it the f*ck down, allowing the animation to complete. Afterwards, my opponent ducks, and turns his face away from me, as if he has accepted his fate in a most submissive manner. I know what I must do. I say a quick prayer to the flying spaghetti buffet, and fire three rounds into my opponent, shitting on him. I go on to place 43rd.

Tldr; Barely beat someone to a gun, we danced off and then I assassinated him.

To me these sorts of things just don’t fit into the game and are too slow and just a battle of luck. I have only won one game against these kinds of people, but they were only halfway done with building their base so we climbed up and shotgun rushed.


TLDR: End game is BORING and RNG (x10 the annoyingness) due to base campers that need some sort of punishment.

I know the beauty of Battle Royales and this one specifically being extremely casual. Is that no matter your loot, how well you're doing or how good you are. You can die at any moment. 

The only downfall of that (*of which seems like a console thing*) Is losing to someone hiding. Not building, or the dreaded bush strategy. I know people want to win. I seriously get that. But I'm talking about the people who find what they can, and instantly find somewhere to sit. And wait. Maybe win the game with 2 kills. I could be biased since I'm so used to roaming and killing a lot. But what really grinds my gears is the guy in the back of the map, with no reason go be there except to win.

**But what shotgun should I pick?**    
For me at the start I would use the semi-auto because it's clearly faster to shoot and that way even if you miss a shot or two you can still keep jumping like a maniac until you kill your opponent.    
However after switching to the pump shotgun, for me it is clearly the superior weapon if you use it correctly. I will try my best to explain why I think this with some clips. The main thing to have in mind is that the semi-auto will usually kill in 2/3 shots (100 hp target) and with the pump you will actually kill your target with 1 pump quite often.

**Base Damage**    
Purple Semi-auto - 74 dmg    
Grey/White pump - 90 dmg    
Green pump - **95 dmg**    

Based on damage alone both guns need 2 shots to kill so the semi-auto would be the best one since it shoots faster but this is where the headshot x2 damage/damage falloff/cone of fire comes into account. The semi-auto has very bad fall off damage and bullet spread, that means you will not be doing that much damage if you are not in a ideal super close situation.    
The pump shotgun seems to have a much tighter spread and that means it is better at a longer distance and more pallets of your shot will hit the target successfully. Keep in mind that you still don't really have to zoom in to use this weapon.

**Examples**    
I usually feel pretty confident when I have 150 HP but this guy destroys me with 1 single pump at what I consider to be a decent range for a 1 pump shotgun - [1 pump at 17 secs](https://clips.twitch.tv/RelentlessGlamorousGalagoPartyTime)

You will find yourself [doing over 100 damage](https://clips.twitch.tv/TardyMoralKimchiVoteYea) without zooming in or aiming that well quite often. The best thing about this gun is the fact that you will 1 shot people much more often than with the semi-auto.

If you are in a town where you can get cover this gun will put your target at 1 shot almost everytime, so you can shoot, hide, shoot again and you will most likely have killed the target - [I got lucky here and did 94 hp and he still died](https://clips.twitch.tv/ExpensiveTameMelonTTours)

And for the last and my strongest point in my opinion is the fact that this gun (besides a sniper headshot) is the only one that will kill your target even if he has 200 HP. [This is the CLUTCH weapon to use](https://clips.twitch.tv/ColdSmoothReindeerFrankerZ) 

Now go out there, don't zoom in, aim for the upper body/head and enjoy the 100+ damage shots you will get.

**TL:DR** - The PUMP shotgun will 1 shot your target from a further distance while the semi-auto will almost never 1 shot your enemy.",FortNiteBR

If Epic decides to include driving vehicles, they should make a lootable CAR BATTERY (preferably a blue rarity?) that makes you decide if you want to waste a slot for the battery and HOPE to make it to a car or leave it for the enemies. It would make it more of a strategic approach.  ",FortNiteBR

287,bluesnd63,1508887124,78joy6,31,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/78joy6/top_10_tips_for_beginners/,32,Top 10 Tips for Beginners,"I have 200 games played and 30 wins, both numbers across solo, duo and squads.  Here are my suggestions in no particular order except number 1.

1. Most important no joke - use a gaming headset if you aren't. It's basically a radar. If you aren't using a headset you likely won't win. It also helps you find chests. Good alternatives are sound bars and surround systems. Anything with directional sound is good. 

2. My overall strategy is always start at the edge of the map and work in, which allows you to focus on what's in front and to the side of you because you always know your back is clear. Once the circle is formed, I always try to rotate towards the area that I believe will be least populated based on what towns people will be coming from. Don't always run straight into the circle. Look at your map and see where the high points will be within the circle and find a safe route to those points. You always want height advantage. See my comment below for further explaining.

3. Never run into a circle, especially late, with your guard down. Always expect every ridge, house, bush, etc. to have someone over/in it. 

4. Get the first few wins under your belt by any means necessary. I personally don't think camping is the easiest way to win because you'll lack good loot to close out a game, but if you can slow play to top 10-20 routinely you'll get a win.

5. Building stairs is key. If you know you're about to get in a 1v1 with someone on the ground, build stairs to get height advantage.  Make sure you change your settings to save what building item you are on (console only). This way you don't have to hit the build button then scroll to stairs every time. This will allow you to build quick in sticky situations. 

6. Know your weapons. The sniper, rocket launcher and RPG are the only weapons you lead your shots with. All others are hitscan and you never lead them no matter how far you are shooting. 

7. Pick your battles. Do not shoot at someone unless you have a chance to kill them and you PLAN to kill them. Why? Even though you think you've only alerted that person you shot at, you just told every other player in the area where you are. The guy just over the ridge might have never seen you but now he heard you and he is going to catch you focused on someone else. 

8. What weapons to use... AR or shotguns are what I use most... Unless I have a rocket launcher. Don't be afraid to use your shotguns from a distance to pop a shield.

9. Not all 1v1 battles have to be quick. Strategize within the fight. Build stairs. Poke up pop a shot. Back down. Let the guy build a wall. Let him think you are healing then ambush him. Obviously that sequence won't work every time, but don't be predictable. Catch people reloading, healing, building, etc. Use your third person camera to your advantage. This game is as much strategy as it is gun skill.

10. If you want squad or duo wins, find a team and get used to their play styles OR if you are queuing solo invite your teammates to a private party chat. 

Any other questions feel free to ask.

Do you know how irritating it is to constantly make it to Top 25 every damn game just to be killed by a bush camper? Every game i'm averaging 4-6 kills or more, clutching battles, beating RNG, weaving sniper bullets, beating the bunnyhoppers with shot guns, successfully ambushing people, etc,etc. All for what? Just to be send back to the lobby screen because someone magically shot you out of no where? and then when you look at the player spectator mode you see the guy coming out of the bush with his ""green"" shotgun or ""common"" assault rifle happily looting the epic scar or purple sniper you grinded ass off for 15 mintues, and this goes on every damn game over and over, i'm tired of it. 

People say ""its not about killing people its all about winning"" mate please shut up, however you reword it you are still ruining the game for people, its not fun to grind for 15+ minutes just to be magically killed by a bush. You cant check every bush you go to, its just to unrealistic why do I have to be paranoid 24/7 because you wanted to be petty and camp in a bush? People say it takes strategy to camp or be stealthy, give me a break any dumbass can find a bush in a circle and hide themselves for 4 minutes while everyone kills each other rinse and repeat, I even do it. 

Now I started to bush camp, and the past couple of games of intense bush camping and running towards the circle I racked up 7 solo wins from the past week and now can consistently make it to top 10 every game if I play my cards right.  

Do I feel bad? No because I just dont give a shit anymore. I have no problem losing, or dying in a fair fire fight but to fucking rack up so many legendary weapons or great weapons just be vaporized under 5 seconds because a person wants to be petty no way bro, im not doing it.

Is it boring? Ofc it is I cant play the game properly because its either Bush camp or be killed by a bush camper. But it is also boring to be killed 2 minutes later after touching a blue AR or epic scar.

All in all, Bush camping made me tactically aware of bushes from now on, I wont say I examine every bush but I can tell if something is up.

I know a few times it would have been beneficial to have them so I could beat the storm after a firefight/looting.

I think they should have a ramp up feature, like if you are running for 3 seconds or something, then the extra speed kicks in. I think something like this would be needed so the shoes/potion are not OP in firefights.

Edit: Some may have understood what I was trying to say, but this is for those who don't. My idea was more as a consumable. Say you win a firefight and there is little time to loot and beat the storm. You could loot and then drink this potion and be able to run faster to beat the storm to the next circle. Also, the potion would only be effective for straight-line speed or would need to ramp up to be effective. That way, the increased speed does not affect firefights or positioning of firefights. 

Edit 2: Another idea I was toying with was to make people faster when they equip their axe. That  way, everyone would have it. You could use it to beat out a storm closing in, but you are also vulnerable to others since your weapon is not drawn as you are running.",FortNiteBR

Everyone Spawns with an Assault rifle and a weapons chest where ammo, etc. is found.  You are given a limited amount of recourses to build.  Each team is given 10 minutes to build a base.  After times up.  its a 4 team battle royal where you must simultaneously defend your base from attacks and attack other bases to get to their weapons chest to acquire more ammo/weapons.  They can even spawn in special weapons in the very center for teams to fight over for an advantage every so often.

I feel this would add a part of the game that we don't see much in PvP.  The game is about building forts but you don't see much of it in PvP.  And if you do, its just quickly thrown together without much thought.  A base vs base game mode would be pretty fun as it would be fast paced, strategic,  and i feel more fun than the traditional battle royal.  I could imagine building a huge base with traps and such.  Having a couple strike teams attack the left and right enemy bases while having the rest defend.

Having to hold multiple AR's because they spawn with 30 ammo shouldn't be a valid or necessary tactic. Seeing a squad in the distance and not being able to fight because you have 15 bullets in your Burst AR, 96 pistol ammo and 48 shotgun ammo is really not fun or exciting. 


Yes, 20 ammo was far too much. But it wasn't just 20 ammo per crate that made it too much, we were also getting frequent double spawns of medium ammo in a single crate. I agree, it was absolutely ridiculous to have 400 ammo after only 2-3 kills and the first circle closing.  But it's just as asinine to end a game with less than 30 med ammo with 10+ kills while being 25+ minutes in. 

There are many ways to balance ammo. 
Crates could give one value i.e. 20, ammo  but outside of crates could be 10. 
 
There are also things like receiving a different ammo amount for different modes, but you could do the same with increased/decreased spawns in each mode. Which makes even more sense. 

Another way is to decrease the damage they do against buildings, though this approach while perfectly capable of achieving balance is also the least intuitive. 


Please, do not slow the pace of the game down because we have no AR ammo and have to sneak into shotgun range for every fight.  Simply because 1 clip (8 rounds) of a shotgun can knock and kill a full squad while 1 clip of an AR can not.

I build a couple walls around me when it was down to the last 7 or 8. 2 people died from the storm, and 2 more were dead in 5 more seconds and then there were me and a team of 2 left. I sniped one, and the other disappeared.


Sat in my little fort on the roof, crouched, waited, heard him behind me chopping at the house.

I dropped 2 nades down there and BOOM Victor Royale! Probably the cheapest win ever but now I understand it's alot of luck.

(please hear me out),"I was about to give up on FNBR until I watched dev diary 2 and heard that the devs are thinking about adding in projectiles for all weapons. If they do this it will completely change the game for the better, and erase the thing that is really turning me off, the feel of combat.

Currently, guns feel bad to shoot because of the need to balance hitscan weapons at long distances. If, lets say, ARs were as accurate as everyone wants them to be on first shot then this game would be ""head shot city"" at 200+ meter ranges. Which is unacceptable for a lot of reasons. That said, the added inaccuracy, which is needed, is exactly what makes combat in this game an rng crap shoot, and the only way to fix this problem is to move to projectile weapons.

So why would projectile weapons fix this problem? Well, first of all, unlike hitscan, projectile weapons fire a bullet that has travel time (velocity) and bullet drop (ballistics) that is unique to each bullet fired. That means if you line up a shot on someones head, and don't take into account the distance and movement speed of that player, you will miss badly. Because of these added variables the guns can be very accurate due to the require skill ceiling being higher. In fact, a projectile based system should not really have much inaccuracy per shot, and instead it should use recoil (like pubg, and battlefield do), along with bullet drop and speed, to balance weapons.

I really really hope Epic considers and implements a universal projectile system into this game. PUBG shows it can be done in BRs and Battlefield shows it can be tweaked to be casual friendly. There is honestly no reason to be using hitscan in 2017, especially if your game has long engagements. The effect, even at 200 yards would be noticible. When I fire my ar15 at a steel plate 200 yards away there is a noticeable delay between the shot and the ping of the hit. You should not be instantly connecting at those distances. 

Thanks for your time.

TLDR: Projectile based system would fix the feel of shooting because guns wouldn't need rng accuracy to be balanced at long ranges. ",FortNiteBR

I can't stand the thing myself. The main problem is that it fires PAINFULLY slow. So slow that by the time you get around to your second shot, which only kills if you landed the first one and if they have no shield, every other gun in the game will have already killed you assuming shots connect. And on the topic of shots connecting, the revolver isn't even accurate to compensate.  Even when standing still and crouched you are still praying to RNGsus for a shot to land if you are engaging at any kind of distance. And may God have mercy on your soul if you are moving and/or jumping, it's like shooting with a blindfold on.  Even if you land a headshot with the revolver by some miracle it won't kill them if they have shields, and then they will probably kill you because you are holding a revolver with its next shot on cooldown.  At the end of the day, it's an almost objectively worse pistol which baffles and disappoints me because I like revolvers, IRL and in games, and it feels satisfying to fire but falls short in pretty much every way.

It feels kind of cheap to have 1.5 or 2 times the health of an enemy in a fight because you managed to find shields while also offering no reward if the unshielded player wins as the potion is consumed with use. I know not everyone will agree and many are fine with shields as they are, but if they were to be changed, these would be my suggestions, I'd also be interested in hearing all of your opinions on the matter.


1- Double potion Spawn rate, reduce shields given to 25%:
This one is pretty much the standard change most people suggest, gives a better chance of having some form of shields which will reduce the margin in health difference. Personally I like this change as it should still be possible to reach 100 shields but also gives more players the chance to pick up some form of shield of their own



2- Replace Shields with Armour:
Again, a common suggestion, the armour system in PUBG is one area where I feel the game does a better job than FNBR. The armour is visible, meaning you can see if an enemy is shielded before engaging, if you kill an enemy with armour you can pick it up afterwards and different armour pieces and levels allow for more chances to gain some kind of protection.
I would love a system like this in FNBR but can't see it being implemented any time soon



3- Headshots ignore shields:
This one is the most experimental of the three suggestions. In this case, any headshot damage would ignore shields and take down health. This would mean no more Bolt Action headshots not getting kills as well as giving more skilled players a chance to overcome the disadvantage of not having shields. The main problem I can see with this system is that, with weapon bloom as it is, fights against or between two shielded enemies may come down to who gets luckier with their weapon spread



Overall I feel like option 2 is the best, Option 1 is most likely and Option 3 is interesting but would probably need changes to weapon bloom before being viable. I know there's been a lot of posts about Shields lately but I'd just like to hear possible changes IF shields were to be changed as opposed to arguments for and against shields remaining as they are. At the end of the day it's Epics decision on what to do with Shields and I trust them to do what they think is best, but it's fun to speculate on changed we'd like to see tried out",FortNiteBR

Not seeing this complaint enough around here, so I decided to make my first post on this sub, as I consider shields the worst factor in this game.

Would like to read downvoters' point of view, please, as they might change my mind about the subject and I really need to understand shields so I can fully enjoy the game.

//

For more than just a few games now, it has happened to me and my squad to have a tactical advantage over enemy squads and engaging them according to plan, only to be face-rolled by a fully-shielded that simply turns around and shoots us afterwards.

The way shields work at the moment just adds undesired RNG to the game: if a squad, **BY CHANCE**, manages to stack up on shields, they have a (not massive, but) considerable advantage over others, which goes beyond skill.

//

If, for example, you are running towards the circle while getting shot at by an enemy squad that has snipers, if you manage to counter-snipe them and run away, you should be rewarded with a kill, as you just stood still against a squad to **TRY TO** take one of them out (latest reason for me to write this post).

Another example: a two-man squad is inside a built base, one of your squad members distracts them while you flank. You managed to get behind them and shoot one of them with a shotgun, but he/she has a shield. While in other circumstances you could be at equal footing right now, BECAUSE OF THE SHIELD you are up against two of them. So made a tactical approach, as one would expect from a battle royale game, and just got **punished**.

Imagine shotgun fights as a turn-based game: you attack, enemy attacks, you attack. If they have shields, your first attack took the shields down. Their first attack simply kills you.

//

**REMOVE SHIELDS OR MAKE THEM A RARE FIND.**

Rant over, thanks for reading.

TL;DR - Shields are RNG-based. Practically give you a second life. If you fight someone decent who has it, you most likely lose.

   When a quick headshot followed by a body shot can have the same result as a well-aimed shotgun/sniper blast or SMG burst (especially at ranges where those weapons would normally be preferred), it's unsurprising that AR's became the dominant gun. Factoring in the lower overall damage from SMG's (headshot or not) and fact that shotguns and snipers have rate-of-fire issues, and it becomes increasingly apparent that AR headshots lead to a lot of unbalance.



   There's also the randomness factor to full-auto headshots that makes them unfair. Perhaps personal experience need not apply, but it seems that every game is filled with encounters where I/another player is at a huge disadvantage in terms of positioning, shields, or weapon class when a headshot from an AR can entirely reverse or end the situation. This is NOT a consequence of skill or smart play; they are mostly random, due to the full-auto nature of AR's, and not the result of any ""skilled"" attempt at headshots like would normally be required from snipers or shotguns to ensure a kill, and so excessive headshot multipliers add an unfair RNG element to gunfights where a random headshot totally changes the tide of battle.



   I'm not suggesting the overall removal of headshot multipliers, but it seems fitting to at least lower it in the face of apparent insta-deaths resulting from a quick AR burst at would otherwise be an advantage for the killed player.",FortNiteBR

Some of you know [Storm Shield One](https://stormshield.one) form the PvE side of the game. It's a Dev tracker (for all dev communications, pve and pvp) combined with mission alerts, daily llamas and other useful information for PvE players. We've also been hard at work on Leaderboards and PvP tracking for Battle Royale at https://stormshield.one/pvp

Just a couple of recent updates I know a few of you have been looking for.

We just implemented graphs yesterday, showing your k/d ratio and wins over time. It'll show the last 20 days at present that we have recorded. Here's an example: https://stormshield.one/pvp/stats/AlexRamiGaming

A couple of notes on the data: Since there's no time series data coming from the game we update it based on profile refreshes. You might need to visit at most once a day to make sure your data is recorded for that day (although we are trying to keep everyone's stats up to date), and for those of you who haven't visited before you might need to visit again tomorrow to start seeing the graph properly.

As well, we've created a Discord bot for looking up stats with the !fnstats command, you can invite it with the following link:

https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&amp;client_id=370717214552227851&amp;scope=bot

It's a brand new bot and may have some growing pains, but please check it out!

It does way too much damage to players, there's too much rockets available and you can carry an unlimited amount of them. The reload time is also ridiculously short for such a powerful weapon. 

I love the fact that in Fortnite the better player usually wins the fight, you can use so many different skills to outplay the inferior player. The RPG takes all of that away and gives an unfair advantage to it's owner. Using the RPG also takes zero skill, the worst player ever can just start spamming your base with it and destroy you. 

So Fortnite team, please do something about this. If you want rockets to be super deadly to the players like they are now, the amount of rockets you can carry should be capped to like 5 max. Another way would be to dramatically decrease the damage the rockets do to players. Personally I feel like the rockets should be mostly used to destroy other players cover, not 1 shot players dead. This would also nerf the RPG as a super OP close range weapon like it is now. It's pretty stupid that you can rush people with the RPG so easily and there's nothing the opponent can do.  


Edit. Looks like I didn't make it clear enough. The closer the range, the bigger the problem. Yes you can often avoid the rockets when they're coming from far away, but if someone decides to rush you there's pretty much nothing you can do. ",FortNiteBR

Hiding is fair play in this game, but there are tons of ways to hide without bushes. You can build your own structures or use hills or hide in preexisting trees, rocks, or buildings.

However bushes cross the line. There should not be a naturally occurring structure the size of 1 person scattered everywhere on the map that hides you SO well that you can be 3 feet from the person and looking right at them and STILL be unable to see them.

It has become too rampant. Every game is packed with people hiding in bushes in the endgame. Solo players make it to the final 3 by staying in the same bush for 10 minutes while everyone else actually plays the game.

I know this post will get downvoted because a lot of really bad players on this subreddit use bushes as a crutch, but the truth has to be said.

I have many rounds and wins in both solo and squad so I've already tried the ""hurrdurr just run into safe zone faster"" strategy. The storm makes me run too early nearly every game. 

In squad mode the problem is worse because fights take much longer. Multiple squads will fight each other at the same time, and that can take a while. Nearly every single time these fights have to end because of the storm.

I just got my first solo win on my 99th game played, and it has to be one of the best feelings I've ever had from a video game! 

(I know I'm late to the party, but I let my roommates play on my account and I watch them eat it over and over for fun hahaha! Soon they'll have their own Ps4 so they can stop murdering my stats!)

I can't believe how hard my heart thumped, after choking in 2nd - 5th over a dozen TIMES (3 tonight alone!) I'd been yearning for my first win! I played game after game adapting, practicing, dying a LOT haha! Then when I finally got the win it was one of the cleanest games I'd ever played, with a long range snipe, great positioning, and a good amount of patience!

I can't wait to keep winning, and keep enjoying this game!!! It's hands down made my top 5 games list!

TL;DR: FIRST WIN AFTER 99 GAMES, AND THIS GAME HAS ME LOVING IT EVEN MORE AND WANTING TO GIVE THE DEVS MY MONEY! I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE GROWING PAINS, IT'S THE BEST FREE GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED! ",FortNiteBR

Interested in base standing accuracy numbers, and running accuracy, crouching, jumping... 

also how long it takes from running to standing for your accuracy to reset to base values.

You also could add a solo in game hunger games style group with increased loot chest rewards, with tension from backstabbing and separating it from pubg. You also can use the balance snipers hitscan and rest projectiles when you increase accuracy to make it so that people don't just pop heads with ar's with that you need to have ads, but don't need as much customisation as pubg as its less streamlined. Have a tagging mechanic. And have faster revives and medkits able to revive you when downed. Or some item that does it. Also some more interesting surreal weapons would be nice, like something that does not damage but disorentates as a silent one use trap",FortNiteBR

I could be wrong, but I feel like BR's map is way too small for the amount of people getting dropped in.

You know how often im dropping into a place only to see 3 others hit the ground a lil bit before me? I always aim for somewhere I dont see anyone going, but there is always someone everywhere. Idk maybe im just not into the RNG based wins this kind of mode is about?

I just dropped into a big farm house by myself, found a pistol. Walked outside to the nearest building, someone had a Scar. Obviously I didnt stand a chance. Wheres the fun in that?

tl:dr I think we need to reduce the total number of people in the match, or give us a Queue for smaller groups. I wanna have a fair fight not just my horrible bad luck.

Yes i know the word is ""when there's enough players"" but there's got to be an estimate based on current growth. I personally find it hard to believe such a popular game would have trouble filling 3 game modes but hey i don't have the data on hand i guess.

Feels bad when games treat you like a second class citizen based on your location.

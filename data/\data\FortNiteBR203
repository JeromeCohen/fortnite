Most people’s fights are dependent on one thing. If someone has explodes. Grenade Launchers, RPGs, Clingers, and more are just too common for what they do. Here are some suggestions on how to rework them.

#Rockets and Grenade Launchers

Rockets and Grenade launchers are REALLY powerful in many aspects. Even with the rocket ammo cap nerf a while ago, it isn’t hard to waste all 12 rockets to kill someone and pick up their 12 rockets. What Epic should do is

**Update the Grenade Launcher and RPG rarities to only gold, and have them only drop in supply drops**

The reasoning behind this is for the incentive to go for supply drops. Right now, Supply Drops are just there. If you see one, you don’t think much of it. Making Grenade Launchers and RPGs only in Supply Drops adds that *Risk and Reward* to them.

#Clingers

Clingers are a fine addition (to an extent). But clingers are found too often. The simple fix is to

**Upgrade the rarity of the clingers to blue, and increase the drop rate**

The changes for this is pretty self explanatory 

#Blast Radius

This has been suggested COUNTLESS times on this subreddit, so I’ll keep it short and simple.

**For builds and players, explosion damage should fall off as you get farther from the center.**",FortNiteBR

This season however, it seems unlocking the skins unlocks the ability to add exp to them. I bought the extra battle pass tiers and unlocked Dire, and now I'm looking at a brand new 250k exp gate to begin unlocking while my Calamity set is at 36k. I figured I would let everyone know who may be thinking ""At least when I hit battle pass level 100 I'll have the full Dire unlocked.""

There's a user asset in the game files specifically for it. It was purposefully added to the skin and left enabled on Season 6 launch.

Knowing this, the question then becomes:

Why would Epic implement that feature for the skin, leave it enabled on launch, only to turn around and remove it hours later, despite the fact that no one seemed to have a problem with it and there was no problem with the skin itself (i.e. no bugs or glitches)?

If it was removed to be more ""family friendly"", then why was it added and left enabled on launch in the first place? It seems a bit hypocritical to remove the feature for this supposed reason, and meanwhile every female skin's rear-end is quite literally in the player's face every single match.

If it was removed for ""sexism"" concerns, the same argument as above still stands, on top of the fact that in response to Epic's own tweets about removing this, there are multiple women commenting that they did/do not care about its implementation. There will of course be some who do, but this is definitely not the case for all people, or even the majority.

A couple of solutions to this problem could be:

* Remove the physics from Calamity in the lobby, if that's a concern.
* Remove the physics from Calamity while using a dance/emote, if that's also a concern.
* Allow PC users to enable and disable it in the game files like you can other settings.

It would be nice to get a real response from Epic on this since the removal seemed rash and hypocritical to how the game and skins currently stand.",FortNiteBR

Hey, it’s called putting in the work. Epic, please don’t soften on the amount of work needed to earn something special in the game. 

I’m an adult. I work 60 hour weeks and own two companies. I have kids and kids activities and homework. I have a wife to keep happy. I travel a ton and have social events constantly, not to mention family travel. All of that comes well before gaming. 

If I can grind out max skins and get all of my weeks finished, anybody can. 

It’s a bummer to think that so many of the younger people here want Epic to spoon feed them valuable things, or make it easier. I hope Epic continues to reward those who really put the grind in. It’s a good lesson for people that otherwise want a handout. 

Nobody owes you max skins, tier 100 or a break on XP grinding, period. If you don’t care to earn it, you don’t deserve it. 

And look. If you don’t want to grind so hard, an extra $15 buys you 1/3rd through the pass. ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is certainly a very 'jumpy' game and no matter what you will probably find yourself jumping a lot. Jumping while traversing the map is generally a good idea, because you will be very hard to hit from a distance as it will be difficult to track you with an AR or Sniper.

However, jumping is not always the best thing to do in a close quarters fight. This is because, once you have started the jump, the arc is easily predictable - entirely the opposite to what you want your movements to be. You want your movements to be dynamic and unpredictable which can be accomplished by a combination of strafing, crouching and jumping. Additionally, jumping can negatively impact your aim is it can be difficult to jump and shoot.

Hope this helps some of you win some more of your fights.",FortNiteBR

But Battlepass-wise, love it or hate it, you've got to admit that the battlepass rewards themselves are much more efforted this time around and that Epic truely listened in on what the community has bickered about for this one:   


* Completely decked out customization on both of the ""main"" skins; Calamity and Dire. Great tier-options that're all generally good in their own way. Including COLORS like all of you've ree'd for since Omega.  

* An actual badass, attractive, generally all around fantastic main skin that's female. (With great customization and colors to boot!)  

* Replacing what would be unused customization tiers on dire with alternate color-schemes that aren't lazy (I'm lookin' at you Omega &amp; Ranarok.)  

* Giving free players a wider assortment of rewards including capes (even if they're tacky.)  

* Newer rewards instead of filler like throwables and sprays. (The menu music is SO appreciated! ♡)  

* Actual WINGS, A katana back bling, more tomato-man love in the form of a cape, and a glider and trail that outclass Valkyrie and Ravage to boot!  

* The lowest needed exp for max-rewards I've ever witnessed. (those of you who complained about ""the grind"" should be happy.  

* Skins that go way ""off-model"" and push the boundaries of what skins can be, even more so than drift or Ragnarok.  

* A basic tier-1 skin that isn't completely bland and boring (You can call Yonder many things: Ugly, Tacky, A mess, but you can't claim he's bland!)

I could go on, but the point is Epic really tried their damndest with this battlepass and I just want to personally thank them for how great it is. This is the first time I've truly felt my money was well spent on the rewards themselves, without a hint of doubt.

Btw I play on console and am decent at building, but there are definitely people better than me, I feel at times when I'm building that there isn't much rhyme or reason to what I'm doing and it's all random(not the technique, but rather the flow) and feel like my opponent knows much more about what they're doing. I still get disoriented during build battles.

I know try keep the high ground during battles.

I know try to keep calm. 

I know people say to look at every failure as a lesson, but sometimes there are moments where I can't think of anything other than, ""I shouldn't have been near them at all or fighting with this team/player"", (basically I should've been somewhere different on the map so I wouldn't have to deal with that battle).

I know people say that repetition(practice) will make you better, but I feel like I haven't hit that spot where I'm comfortable enough in the game to be confident enough to make plays and I've been playing since season 1 on PS4(25 total wins out of 2,155 matches played).

This is probably the most complicated multi-player game I've ever played because I've watched so many tutorial videos for building, placement, map rotation(which I still barely understand), shooting and what-not. It just seems like there is so much to remember(and be aware of) that it's hard to actually remember it all while trying to focus on a battle in the moment.

So it kind of baffles me when people say playing solo squads will make you better because you also need to have every other system down to a tee to be really good at the game. 

So to anybody who's played solo squads to get better, what's your experience been? Has it actually made you a better player? And how? ",FortNiteBR

The LMG was the only weapon (excepting the vaulted drum gun) with the capability of engaging in suppressing fire while also granting its wielder enough mobility to outflank, especially in lengthy encounters against builders. I think a lot of the reason people disliked the LMG was because they treated it as a short-range weapon akin to an SMG, which it never was. Instead, the LMG blended the speed of an SMG with the siege capabilities of a minigun, making it a fantastic siege weapon for mobile squads who relied on mobility and close coordination.

When it got vaulted, the friends I play with really suffered. In a typical engagement, it served as the offensive anchor to our squad. Its high rate of fire and damage meant it could tear through structures almost as well as a minigun. The large magazine meant that it could stay engaged for the entire duration of most fights. No charge time meant that unlike the minigun, the person wielding it could lay down suppressing fire, disengage and move, and immediately reengage at any moment. The place it really shined was in point-blank flanking maneuvers; if your teammates could tie up an enemy for long enough to get the LMG around their backside, it had the potential to singlehandedly wipe entire squads, or at the very least disorient them for long enough for your teammates with better short-range weapons to close in and finish them off.

Its removal really highlighted how unique it was, because suddenly we have way fewer tactical options when facing off against builders. SMGs aren't good enough against structures because their damage is too low and their small clips mean they have to reload frequently, which often reduces pressure on an enemy for long enough for them to orient themselves and attack as a group from behind defenses. On the other hand, the minigun's charge time means that its wielder cannot stop firing without drastically reducing pressure on an enemy, preventing the wielder from doing any meaningful maneuvering. The other problem that arises with the removal of the LMG is that there's no longer a fast-firing automatic weapon that doesn't use light bullets, meaning that any squad that engages in sieges runs a disproportionately high risk of running out of ammo as early as the first engagement.

With the removal of the drum gun earlier in Season 5, and now the LMG, there no longer exists a siege weapon that combines firepower, mobility, and a type of ammunition that isn't limited to light bullets or rockets. This change actually hurt the tactical dynamism of the game, and indirectly buffs an already powerful building mechanic.

By tunnel vision, I mean fixating yourself on one person and ignoring everything else around you. You’re shooting somebody and somebody else is shooting you? Kill the dude who is shooting you, don’t go for the cheap kill before you will die as a result. 

This is especially common when you first land. You and somebody land in the same area and only one of you gets the gun. A good player will eliminate the threat, yeah but a good player will also know when to back off and that they should loot up before they go on the offensive. Say you’re both at cobble in tilted, the smart play would be to break some pallets, get some ammo, open some chests, etc. The dumb play is to jump off the side of the building, take fall damage and to chase the other guy to Ls just to get a kill and be eliminated shortly thereafter because they thought it was a good idea to go out into open areas with just a pistol. 

Now I’m not saying you should play passively but honestly, fixating yourself on one person and going through Olympic gymnastics to kill one person despite there being a dozen other people around you, is just not a good idea no matter which way you slice it. 

Maybe it’s just me but you’re usually in the game for the long haul, you’re not going to get very far with almost no guns, no resources, no ammo, etc. 

I wish people would widen their tunnel vision and pay attention to their surroundings rather than making their one and only goal to kill you that game. 9 times out of 10, the people who are guilty of this usually get demolished within seconds of killing you. ",FortNiteBR

It's fun for people watching, but it's very frustrating for people who serve basically as targets. In the last PRO's-only video the last few seconds of the game consisted of a bunch of people stuck in a bunch of wooden cubicles just trying not to get killed by the storm, and the winner had not 9, 12, 16 kills, but only one and he didn't win by killing the other player.

I understand that there's a lot of money involved: youtube gets money from PRO-streamers, EPIC gets money from people buying v-bucks to buy new costumes, but that all comes at the cost of the game being very frustrating for people who don't have a good enough computer, or bad reflexes, or bad internet. If you're a really bad player, then you really have no way to get good since you'll die within the first 10 seconds of landing and if you just keep circling the zone until you're the only other person left you'll take a lot of time to build up skills on one on one in order to have a chance of winning.

If people who are bad stop playing this game there will be no reason to keep providing streamers with VERY EASY KILLS and VERY EASY WINS, so at least give us a reward since we're the ones who make this game fun and not just a stupid cubicle fight.",FortNiteBR

Ive been a player since season 1 and this games popularity has blown me away, i was a petty xbox player who had never played any battle royales in my life.

The second i played the game i knew it was something special and i instantly loved it.

Season 1 was awesome and i was having a great time so i decided to buy a skin, THE SKULL TROOPER.

I didnt know about it or that it would every be worth hundreds of dollars, i just wanted to play the game, have fun and invest in the game.

Personally i believe the skin should not return because it should be an award to those who played and paid the game. It should be a reward to those who wanted to spend money on the game from the start.

After all Epic is a buisness and while they care about the community they are at the end of they day a buisness.

Now im wondering, the only reason to bring it back is to literally make tons of money from purchases and while epic have made millions and millions, i hope they do not sell out and just give us season 1 players and investors something to show that we were there.

This is my opinion, i hope it doesnt come back, i hope i can play with it and be an original and rare skin, because it is so cool.

I dont see a valid reason on why to bring it back, and i think it should be an award because it is that awesome.

Yes there is the renegade raider but i think the skull trooper should be on the list too.

Let me know what you think, this is an opinion so dont get salty.",FortNiteBR

Before you listen to what I say, I don't want to sound anyway that im biased because I got killed a couple of times in solo, while actually im a fairly good player, but what I want to talk about is whats best for Fortnite to grow.

Ever since 50v50 has came out public lobbies have seen to be getting more better and better players. I don't want to blame this on that gamemode but im just trying to pin point the facts. Why is this? Its because 50v50 is easy. Beginners and casual players tend to go to this gamemode due to the regular battle royal experience being a bit too hard for them, because of this, regular lobbies such as solo, duo and squads have seen and increase in skill level all through out. 

Then the cycle continues even more, 

Players play the regular battle royal experience, find out it's too hard for them, so they try 50v50 where most of the casual players are and enjoy it.

Now, im NOT saying we need to remove 50v50, but add a competitive gamemode. Hear me out.

A competitive gamemode would make the regular lobbies less of a f*** fest and actually make them more rather chill like the lobbies used to be. It has been said by many fortnite players that the community has gotten too good but the truth is that casual players play 50v50 while competitive players have no other lobbies than the regular gamemodes. 

Right now I believe a competitive gamemode is desperately needed. Not only for the enjoyment of players but for the game to grow. If they want the true battle royal experience they will get absolutely destroyed and struggle very hard to get better, possible forcing them away from the game. (This could be the reason why people have been saying fortnite is dying? That's just speculation)

Please EPIC, if your listening, make the regular experience less competitive and add a competitive mode. From, a player that played on day one, slowly losing love for the game they once cherished.

TL;DR Fortnite lobbies skill gap is increasing alot due to beginners and casual players going to play 50v50 while competitive players have no where else to go than the regular gamemodes. A competitive game mode can fix this.",FortNiteBR

And after this Post from Epic Games ( r/https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1045674846636711936 ) i knew some message must be behind it.

So i went there and searched for some answers. I c4'd the whole castle to see if there is something under the castle. A secret passage or something like this. But there was none.

So the only thing thats in the castle are these 4 coffins which all have the same Numbers on it -&gt; 1345 - 1999 -&lt; ( [https://gyazo.com/121e1fb5830bbc4c3569dc87d877380a](https://gyazo.com/121e1fb5830bbc4c3569dc87d877380a)) .

And Season 6 isn't a great development.,"The Grappler is in my Opinion a serious problem for the Game. It takes away all the learning curve of building for new Players too, because i know alot of people will come up with that ""Argument"". Newer players get better, and so do they realize how important building is, like everyone of us did. And giving them something that makes Building useless isn't a good Idea at all.


Now, it should be obvious why im Complaining about the Grappler. If you have it, you have a huge advantage. If you don't, but the enemie does, it's gonna be a really hard fight for you. Building up really quick without making fails takes an insane amount of work and focus. If yoi Build yourseld high up to get the highground, just for some random clicking one button to be with you, is absolutly absurd.

Epics ""nerf"" didn't change anything. Yes, you can use it less times, but that doesn't change anything.

Epic keeps adding new additions to the Game that ruins the Games for Most loyal players. Someone that put alot of affort and time into getting better in the Game, is now getting smacked easily by anyone that just needs to get lucky with his loot.

And something that actually took skill to use like the Bouncer gets VAULTED!?

Season 6 Overall is great, the Battlepass is awesome, great new skins and a better designed world with more Places. But don't we forget something? What about the Gameplay? Does the Gameplay actually improve? NO. Did they fix those Many Server Issues? Ghost Ping? Glitching trough shit? Not being able to edit properly sometimes? No, they are still concentrateing on the most Basic things that earn them lots of Money. New Players, and Skins. And you know what? It works. And that's just madness.",FortNiteBR

I've never seen anyone really complain about it outside of the players from the shotgun community.  As of update 6.00, it has been vaulted. When the p90 came out, and then was immediately nerfed, it was fine, it needed to be downgraded.  but it was nerfed to the point that hardly anyone uses it.  you see it usually left behind in loot drops, as it just isn't the ""Legendary"" Weapon you would ever need.  We then also lost our other purple SMG, to have this new version come out, which has the overly spread bloom.  The only semi accurate gun the SMG community had was the silenced SMG, that could do some damage and hit the target more so than any other SMG.  But now that is gone as well.  As I said above, the SMG isn't some raging screaming community that when we loose our ""Double pump"" go wild and start throwing hate message and mail left and right.  But I figured I'd say something, cause now you've left us with nothing we can really use to win or enjoy the game anymore.  I did say enjoy in this last sentence, cause it appears things are changing in this game, and the e-sports are going to dominate how things happen and what things happen in this game now.  It's crazy when you think about it.  When fortnite came out not a lot of people wanted to play it, cause it looked cartoony and lame, but once it was given a a chance, people turned around and started liking it.  But since stuff has become completely serious and everyone is building skyscrapers, it not fun anymore.  You can't go out to the bar, drink with your friends and come home and play fortnite with them cause you'll just get slaughtered by players using shotguns and building over you and placing traps.  

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr  .... I miss season 1 and Bring back Silent subs.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know everyone at EPIC is hard working and has to deal with kids whining and the game breaking and I'm sure it gets completely overwhelming.  But there are many of us who still have faith in you guys as a game company, cause you guys were the underdogs at one point, but pulled yourselves up and took the ""Victory Royale"".

So far this has helped me out in so many ways. 

Here is a picture of my [current button layout](https://imgur.com/gallery/RVMVzet)

**NOTE** this is only preference

To start, I used the Builder Pro configuration because it already works really well and only needed a few refinements. 

[Move Jump to L3] The first thing that had to change was the jump button, by moving that from X to L3 it allows you to keep your thumbs on the joysticks when jumping. This comes in handy when fighting because it allows you to jump and turn at the same time effortlessly. This was something I did when I started playing Overwatch as Lucio.

[Move Toggle Pickaxe to X] While having it on the triangle button still works, having it closer to you thumb allows faster toggling. 

[Assign Edit to Triangle] Having an instant edit button is necessary if you want to get faster with editing mid-fight. Before the update this wasn't possible, you would normally have to hold Circle to bring up the editing options. 

Depending on your play style you might keep Toggle Pickaxe on Triangle and then have the Edit button on X for faster editing. For some reason this just didn't work for me and in my head it made more sense to have the Pickaxe on X. 

I also played around with moving the Switch Modes to R3 and moving Crouch to Circle (for faster building) but that messed me up in so many ways I kept it the same. 

Although it hasn't been more than two days, so far I have noticed a huge difference in my play style. ",FortNiteBR

Though I did like it because, y'know, and the fact that EPIC wanted to try something new with the skin models. The Jubilation emote didn't help it at all, it made it feel as though the physics were more jiggly than they were supposed to be which kinda made it more provocative.

Those physics could have been a huge step to make the skin models feel less stiff. Now that EPIC has removed it, I kind of feel disappointed about the whole thing now.

How is 60 fps VS 300 fps fair ? 

Ruined it for me honestly i know i will get alot of hate cause controller players hate kbm players.

But on ps4 we get input lagg there is a delay on everything and now were supposed to keep up with insane pc players, i have neverrrr seen this much good players on ps4 after 2 months of playing fortnite in a day on crossplay.

And no im not a guy who likes to Bully or dominate console with kbm im below average 

My english is bad but i am very frustrated cause to me it Just seems the more People that cry or Bash on epic get their way lol..

I got a total of 5 wins in a 1000 games or so kbm on console im Just a casual player tbh

I Just dont think this is fair Either make kbm servers on ps4 or something to make it fair, but i Bet they Wont cause honestly i dont think there are enough kbm players on console

Sorry that i cant repair gaming pc! 

Controllers dont have delay Like inputlagg idk how to explain it also controllers get aim assist

Ill stop my rant probarly already making a fool out of myself but i cannot enjoy fortnite anymore and i had to Write something down to release some irritation

Can't we have 1 decent shotgun, that destroys in up close combat.
I thought it was pretty balanced. Sucks ass from a distance, deadly up close, longish reload.

My theory is that Epic listens to streamers too much...

They didn't like the drum gun meta, epic removes it.
They didn't like double pump, epic removes it.
They thought the P90 was too OP, epic nerfs damage and decreases clip size.
They thought the grappler had too many shots, epic decreases it from 15 - 10.
They used and abused ghost speaking with edit or damaging structures to see through it, epic removes it.

It seems like this game gets tweaked and changed by streamers opinion and granted some of these changes I like but,  c'mon some of us don't play 6-12 hours a day.  It would be nice to have consistancy knowing what I can count on or not.

Double Barrel nerf is ridiculous imo and was changed because it's the GOD gun in these skirmish tournaments and too many streamers whined about it. 

I think it's silly I'll see someone like KingRichard for example, whine about how the shotguns are shit and need to be fixed but, than he will put out a YouTube saying how the double barrel is OP.

Why you guys be so toxic about KBM, I’m pretty sure you guys will answer with the typical “because keyboard and mouse are better than the controller”. Well that maybe be true to other games but fortnite is different.

If I have the same settings as you guys with the controller have how can I be dominant against controller users? It’s not like I can aim with perfection, because the settings are different in Fortnite.

I am global elite in cs go which requires a great aim and a lot of game sense and I’m not good at aiming in fortnite even tho I’m good at aiming in general FPS, the difference is that fortnite is a game of its own and doesn’t copy other games.

Of course, I may say that mouse is better than a controller, but the skill gap isn’t so big as you guys make it to be.

Fatal Fields was my favourite spot to land as it is one of the few areas you can loot without having to turn corners of a house and endure the 50/50 of getting shot in the face with a tac, a rare location where you can land, pick up a gun and use the open areas to think about how you wanna play out a fight. Whether you wanna shoot from a range, pick up some mats and get up close, the choice was up to the player. Over the past season I was consistently landing, getting actual weapons and picking up a decent amount of kills before I would leave to the next location. The open level fields allowed for real gun battles, not the turn around a corner and jump around BS hoping you pick up the kill, which is especially important for consoles and the switch where you can't be as accurate in those sort of situations. It's important to have a spot you can land that allows for this. 

Why

Why add massive maze fields that make you invisible. 

Wtf is the point.

How is that competitive. 

If you wanna get lost in a maze and turn corners just go to wailing woods why ruin a perfectly good spot. It boggles my mind, that I can no longer pick up an AR/hunting rifle and get into realistic ranged fights with everyone just running around and hiding in these dumb fields. And they added like 4 of them blocking off so much vision for the entire location. This hide and seek bs really accentuates Epic Games goals in catering to the children rather than creating a competitive environment.

It's really not very fun at all when the game plays out this way, and it's getting very predictable. I usually play a game or two and call it quits nowadays because of this. 

So, what's wrong with SBMM? It seems to me that the people who are against SBMM are usually these high-level players. I can't understand why any average or below-average player would want to be in a game with people way above their skill. The vast majority of people don't build like Ninja.

However, for me, I have to hold down the A button to go into edit mode. Can anyone please tell me how to switch from hold to instant edit?

So one that i think would be awesome is cats. I personally was kinda disappointed that there were no cat pets on the battle pass. I think they should have different types (black/calico/tortoiseshell) like they did with the dogs. Another popular pet that i think would be cute is a hamster. But some more interesting ideas I had where some baby animals like a bear cub or a baby giraffe (credit to user u/ErikTait for that idea). Please tell me what you think in the comments! :)

We are both going to wear default skin wedding clothing and do the default dance as our first dance.

She lives in USA and I’m in England but as soon as I send her the air fare and some money next week  to take care of her sick mum she will come over and we can start planning the wedding.

Thank you fortnite for bringing us together.

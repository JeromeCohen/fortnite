Getting shot by 3 bullets silently is broken as fuck.

And this isn't because they're super far away, this happens at any distance and is seemingly random. How am I supposed to counter someone when I have 0 time to react to thier shots?

Frustrating,"Maybe every 4th 90 degree turn I hear all the build sounds but they all place a second later. Also when I'm doing all my inputs correctly but the game will skip some. For example if I edit something and left click drag, it won't register that I left clicked. Or maybe it wouldn't register that I switched to my wall piece in time and I'll just start placing ramps randomly. Or I'll switch to my ramp and left click but it won't build anything at all. So because of this I have to slow myself down just to be more consistent with my ping which fluctuates around 20-30 ms, pretty low so I think it's more an issue on epic's netcode and servers for solo playgrounds. I think it's time for some things to be client sided or at the very least handled better by the server",FortniteCompetitive

22,ItsLeffty,1539292491,9ne0pt,26,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9ne0pt/disabled_gamer_pov_unable_to_play_in_live_epic/,1,(Disabled Gamer POV) Unable To Play In Live Epic Games Events,"I'm deeply frustrated with the recent release of information about the requirements for players of specific equipment that they have to use. I can understand frustrations of people who don't like how it feels, or who don't like to use that mouse specifically but what if you physically are unable to use it to begin with?

A brief summary of myself, I'm Leffty, a competitive Fortnite player and an advocate for the disabled gaming community who had plans to go to twitch con to experience both the event and the competition that Epic Games is holding. I've had to cancel these plans because of my physical condition which is that i'm partially missing my right hand. I was born with a stump on my right hand however I don't let it stop me from trying to play at the highest of levels.

The requirement of specific peripherals is in fact discriminatory to the disabled gaming community and that community is in the right to file a complaint under the Americans with Disabilities (ADA).

*Sec. 12113. Defenses*

*(a) In general*

*It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this chapter that an alleged application of qualification standards, tests, or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be job- related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation, as required under this subchapter.*

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to bring this to everyone's attention because I believe in playing with not only works, but what feels best for you. I think that as a community we can agree that the requirements for specific peripherals should, at the very least, be looked at to be refined and changed. For example, players competing in the online fall skirmish have a Google form that they fill out. A similar form can be sent out OR signed at the event itself which gives players options between 2-3 mice to choose from.

I believe these changes are necessary in further growing the competitive scene of Fortnite and allowing ANYONE with ANY disability the chance to compete and represent themselves.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this will help eliminate any frustrations and allow all players, like myself, the ability to play live at the event comfortably and effectively.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Just as a small note\*\*\*

My intention is to create discussion and change for not just disabled gamers but everyone who has a dream of playing in an Epic Games live event. I DO NOT wish to create any hatred towards Epic &amp; Fortnite. They are a fantastic group of people who are really doing us a big service by creating these events. I just think its unfair that the way I was born dictates my ability to compete as well

I have never seen anyone mention a similar setup. Before I continue, I expect some people to think this seems extra but there's a method to my madness. Here's to you fellow sweats on Xbox/console. Anyway;

**Top Left** ~ *LB*
**Top Right** ~ *RB*
**Bottom Left** ~ *A*
*Bottom Right removed*

Now for the standard buttons;

**RB** ~ *B*
**LB** *is right dpad &amp; I have my edit set to right dpad inside fortnite's own custom button layout. Everything else is Through the Elite Controller*

I am testing other custom bindings that came with the update but there's nothing else I'd like to recommend at this time.

*My opinion on a scuf is biased however it looks like it would be awkward to use LB RB with the paddles. With the Elite's paddles it feels natural.*

This allows smooth, fast building **&amp;** weapon swapping without ever having to move off the triggers. The essential build button is in a favorable spot for speed &amp; momentum, unlike B or the awkward analog click. Until the update LB was empty however I hoped they would add a instant edit &amp; it fits perfectly.

If you can use build on the last paddle give it a try. That specific paddle hinders my accuracy, personally.

Let me know your thoughts &amp; if you end up using this layout or a variation please let me know that it has helped you. I would appreciate the feedback.

At this point I believe I could compete in solo events and win. After the announcement of the Fall Skirmish weeks ago and hearing about the grand finale being at twitchcon, I assumed it was going to be like PAX West (an open solo tournament) so I purchased twitchcon tickets, booked hotels, rented a car, and bought plane tickets (I live in chicago). It's all i've been looking forward to the past couple of weeks and it's what has been motivating me to grind every single day, me wanting to place high in the grand finale. Now today we all learned that twitchcon in fact is a duos event, and i'm a solo player with no connections, and knows nobody in the scene. I don't think it's a smart idea to find a duo partner now and try to compete, because we would have very little chemistry and it's not worth going to potentially not even make it out of the qualifiers and it's not even a guarantee that we would get picked to play in the qualifiers at this point.

The point i'm trying to make is, I know it's not anyone at Epic's fault that I did what I did, and they probably had a reason why they didn't announce what kind of event was going to take place at twitchcon earlier, I'm just so beyond disappointed and heartbroken that I will not have an opportunity to show out in a solo event, and don't know when the next opportunity for me will come. I plan on trying to cancel all of my reservations and try to get a refund on everything i've purchased.

On a final note, I will continue to grind and I will continue to wait for my opportunity, but I would love to see some change on how announcements like these are handles, for people like me who have no connections, don't know anyone, and want to compete. Thank you all for whoever read this.",FortniteCompetitive

**PC**

So this is probably going to be biggest Topic: The best Setup for PC Gaming.

Lets start out with the basics: The Keyboard. A lot of people don't know how important it is to have a responsive and high quality keyboard. And when I'm talking about high quality i don't mean a keyboard that does [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNqksuoK-PU), i mean a keyboard that is very responsive and is made with high standards. 

You might think, ""Hey its not that important, i can just use my rubberdome office keyboard""
right?
WRONG.

There is a lot to take in consideration when buying a keyboard. You might want that cheap 12 dollar keyboard but let me tell you, its all the wrong decision. There are multiple factors to this, let me go trough them really slowly.

*Input Lag*
Lets say you are writing really fast. You might notice that everything you type takes a very short but still noticable time until it gets recognized by your PC. This is pretty normal with cheap rubberdome keyboards. If you don't know what a rubberdome/membrane keyboard is, here you have a [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard). So, as you probably already know, when it comes to a really fast paced game like Fortnite where super fast edits and quick builds are the key to getting the Victory Royale, these few miliseconds might make a big difference between getting the win and not getting it.

*Anti-Ghosting*
In a lot of games, including Fortnite, Anti-Ghosting can get really important. Lets say you are doing a really intense and fast build and you press multiple button at the same time / almost immediately after each other, it can happen that your budget keyboard won't notice one or more key/s that you press. This could cost your life.

*Overall*
A mechanical gaming keyboard feels more responsive, is more sturdy and lasts longer and last but not least it gives you (with most cherry mx switches) a little to REALLY LOUD click to confirm that the key you pressed has actuated.

Things to remember:

Watch out what kind of cherry mx key you buy. They might feel and sound different. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12L0QZFf2XA) you have a good video about the cherry mx keys. Keep in mind, even if your keyboard doesn't use cherry mx keys they usually have colours to identify the sound / feeling (blue = clicky, brown = tactile bump etc.)

However, to me, it's become abundantly clear he has fallen behind the skill gap. His building is probably average at best (for the entire playerbase) and he has absolutely no chance in a build-off against any pro. He even gets out-built in a lot of pubs now, especially that he is on PC. In pubs, he is still able to put together some high kill games due to his stellar positioning and aim, but he looks more and more out of place outside of Tilted due to his lack of building skill.

For perspective, even Aydan, by far one of the best builders and editors on console, still has trouble making it to the final stages of competitive matches due to the relative lack of quick editing from a controller. Nick is world's behind Aydan in that department. 

As long as the competitive scene does not do a 180 and go back to the days of pub stomping Friday Fortnite style, Nick will be more and more irrelevant as I just don't think his gameplay progression has kept up with the skill gap.",FortniteCompetitive

However as it currently stands, two near equally skilled players(AKA pro league players) will have a 1+ minute fight with a very noticeable structure and the fights pretty much boil down to quick reaction times and mechanical skill and feel very samey under a casual eye. Fights essentially become 50/50 unless a third partier comes along or one person runs out of mats. As it stands terrain and environmental awareness plays very little importance in fortnite at high levels other than during endgame when getting up on a mountain is key to winning late game engagements. Other than that, unless you’re low on mats, you’re going to just build/edit/shoot your way to victory. 

But with a lowered mat count say 350-500 per material, fights are shorter and being aware of your surroundings becomes very crucial. That big-ass tree that is currently just an annoyance and blocks your builds can be used as cover and to farm up and recharge.  It’d be especially cool if farmable objects have a damage reduction to non-explosive damage. I’m not saying make them impenetrable, but maybe double the amount of AR/pickaxe shots it takes to take down a tree or rock or pre-existing structures. Let us use natural terrain to our advantage. It’s a shame that epic has created this sprawling map but for 70% of the game you really don’t care about it. Because you can literally build high ground and cover within seconds with little to worry about everything that terrain SHOULD do.


Tl;dr: *as an LTM* lower mat count, increase farm rate (20%?), increase health of farmable objects and maybe increase the amount of farmable items on the map to reward a more tactical approach to the game. Building will still be the most important skill in the game, but fights won’t be nearly solely based on build skill. ",FortniteCompetitive

Aside from any discussions on skill or decisionmaking I want to show how the early game of another player had a positive impact on Tfue's lategame.

LiquidChap is known to land Wailing Woods.

As LiquidChap is of course a very capable player, this typically means the entire Wailing Woods area is farmed and looted, given the zone isn't miles away.

This game however, LiquidChap was taken out by Ghost Bizzle and placed 68th as can be seen here:

https://clips.twitch.tv/AbnegateClearStrawberryImGlitch

Sadly, Ghost Bizzle does not have a VOD for this event, but what I think happened is that Bizzle assumed the area was already looted by LiquidChap and left the area.

These events were vital to Tfue's victory.

When Tfue ended up rifting to Wailing Woods he was confused as to why the area hadn't been looted (Because LiquidChap lands there and people generally do not contest the area).

Tfue landed in the center of Wailing Woods with only 292 wood, 124 brick and 34 metal on him, while carrying a grey Assault Rifle, Blue Pump, Blue Bolt and a Chug Jug.

After landing, the zone was generous enough to stay on top of the center Wailing Woods, allowing Tfue to farm up.

Later, after taking a bathroom break, Tfue leaves the area with 242 wood, 765 brick and 674 metal on him, while having upgraded his grey Assault Rifle to a blue one and picking up 3 mini's

The extra materials and upgraded loadout all come to great use in later securing the Victory Royale.

And that is how the earlygame of one player, or two players, had a significant impact on the lategame of another.

Note: Of course we can't tell exactly what would've happened if LiquidChap was alive by the time Tfue entered Wailing Woods or if Ghost Bizzle had set up shop there, but what we do know is that the material count for Tfue at the time of arrival in Wailing Woods wasn't going to last him long if he had to fight.",FortniteCompetitive

If you kill with the grey AR it becomes green. Another kill? Blue. Three kills? You got yourself a purple scar. 

This also applies to shotguns for people to get to heavy or double barrel. Which in turn may change the meta slightly away from spray, as a purple or gold heavy/db is more valuable than a P90 over blue SMG.

This game turned into buildmania and its getting really stale when the only ""counter"" is to just spray SMGs despite this being unreliable as turbo building manages to build a wall before your shot is able to register.

It seems like after the skirmishes people have just realized that hiding and avoiding any confrontation unless its putting down a trap is the best way to play the game. But wah we got the C4 vaulted for no real reason other than ""its annoying"". Yeah at least you could actually breach corner campers with it and same applied to the clingers when they could damage through walls.

The 7th storm circle (the one that goes way outside of the current circle) ends up cucking you half of the time (for me literally every time I get to it), so you have to run 300m in a 50m storm. I've been cucked by the storm literally 10 games in a row, and each time I've had to expend 2,000 mats just to hold onto high ground because usually the storm gets me 20HP since I have to cover every angle due to spray. I just lost a 15k to a Skull Trooper with Red Shield and Batsickle because he sprayed me with a minigun and 18 nades from a GL, because he had a 6 walls-tall 1x1 metal base right in the middle of circle and I had 120 HP (100 Shield 20  HP), since edit delays made me take extra damage I didn't need to take, etc. Removing Bouncers has literally fucked up this mode so much, spraying and third partying is so strong now and now I can't get reliable high ground or movement 9 times out of 10 I lose it's because of teaming or the storm. Launch Pads are the only hope now, but guess what? We have a super-accurate AR now so I'm not even safe doing that. I'll probably get headshot twice by a default spraying me, which literally happened to me yesterday. I used to love playing Solos, every man for himself, but now I'm getting 2v1ed more than I am in Duos or Squads. This game needs Bouncers back, increased Launch Pad drop rate, and for the love of fucking God, delete the new storm circle changes. They're an abomination.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: now we have no Bouncers, it's so hard to escape lasering, 'splode spam, and getting cucked by the storm circle. Spraying and camping is prevalent and playing hyper-passive is the only way to win now, since one shotgun shot and you'll have 2 people spraying your ass. We need Bouncers back and Launch Pads to be more common, resetting or reworking the current storm circle system from the 6th circle onwards (especially in the 7th), and perhaps reworking ARs because of their luck factor (this is pretty major though and probably means nothing onscreen).",FortniteCompetitive

I may not agree with a lot of their decisions, but I could see the reasoning behind most of them. There was always an argument to be made that could defend their decisions, whether you agreed with them or not. Remove bouncers to prevent riskless high ground builds, add mobility items to encourage faster plays, etc.

The quad rocket launcher, however, is where I draw a line. Remember a while ago when they 'nerfed' regular Rocket Launchers by adding an equip time and increasing reload time? Because I do. They did this to prevent double or even triple rocket spam. The rocket launcher was in a really good place after that. No complaints, not OP nor underwhelming. The weapon did what it had to do. Deal spike damage in a blast radius to both structures and players.

The addition of the quad launcher is completely random and the exact opposite of what they tried to achieve with nerfing the og rocket launcher in the first place. It's like they completely forgot they nerfed the og rocket launcher. It's a fucking joke, really. ",FortniteCompetitive

I think we can all moderately agree that the BR mode isn't the healthiest for Fortnite. It has taken Epic how many months to get it right and they're still so far away. The views have been dropping on the skirmishes and the general consensus surrounding fortnite competitive is ''unexciting''. I think a fresh new mode will do good to spark up the competitive scene for fortnite.

- More focus on individual players / teams rather than a clusterfuck of 100 players.

An awful lot of people have been complaining that this tournament is full of content creators, while also pointing out that many great players have been overlooked, for example almost all of liquid and every player in Ghost's 50v50 team.

Because I've watched pro scrims for 6 months and appear to know about more players than the average member of the sub I decided to go through every player in the NA tournament and rank them in one of 4 categories. This system is relatively subjective and not perfect by any means but I tried to be as neutral as possible. I went through these pretty quickly too so there may be 1 or 2 errors.

* Fine: A player who plays Fortnite consistently to a professional standard. Ways they have demonstrated this **include** being a PAX finalist, having impressed in skirmishes, or being regular scrimmers in the pro discord. Pubstomping ability alone is not a good enough indication.
* eh: Probably a questionable choice, particularly considedring the talent which is not playing on Friday. Still fairly good players pro pro standards - obviously way above average), or may be unproven in a competitive competition or without a teammate who often carries them.
* no: Pretty obviously not a pro level standard, unlikely to be able to compete with the players ranked fine, may have proved that in other skirmishes or just in pubs.
* idk: People deciding players are trash just because they haven't hear of them is the exact reason everyone is saying the lobby is absolute trash. If I know nothing about a player and can't find any indicative info then i won't try to rank them.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w3MZ\_tKAn\_Of2jw0WR0g8uCBgPsNOXQVaPctws83Bk4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w3MZ_tKAn_Of2jw0WR0g8uCBgPsNOXQVaPctws83Bk4/edit?usp=sharing)

&amp;#x200B;

I have linked the sheet above. The results proved my hypothesis that although an awful lot of good talent has been left out the field is pretty strong. 70% of the line up was ranked fine, with only 7 players ranking as a definitive 'No'. Even if we assume 50% of unranked players fit in the 'no' category then there are 14 players who rank as no. I do not believe this is by any means acceptable, and of course it is equally important that so much talent wasn't invited.

My main point here is don't assume players are trash or content creators (or both) just because you haven't heard of them. Few people had heard of Morgausse prior to PAX west but those who had heard of him were not surprised to see quite possibly the most prolific solo scrimmer in NA win the entire thing. The lobby for Friday is very competitive  and I'm looking forward to it.

I'm really really competitive player. There is literally **nothing** i love more in the world than playing games competitively. I'm trying so hard to be the best. I've been really competitive since i was kid and there is nothing i like more than winning.

I never want to be at disvantage. I practiced new controller grip (claw) even though it felt terrible, just not to be at disvantage against any console player. 

I can't play as many hours as most of the pros can, but i'm trying to practice as effeciently as i can. Spending alot of my time in Playground, there is literally no building strat i'm not able to execute. I'm trying to work on the areas i lack the most.

You might ask: Whats holding you back then?
Simply, playing on Xbox, console.

Playing on console is struggle. Even though i've been playing on Xbox for good time now, controller still feels unnatural and cluncky to me. My games is running really poorly on my Xbox One X and lack of graphical options (turn off motion blur etc) is terrible. Biggest thing is that i'm just not comfortable with my controller.

Not only holding controller feel unnatural and really uncomfortable, my chair is also really uncomfortable. Here is my current ""setup"": https://imgur.com/a/9eYRjMW


I have never owned good enough pc to run any modern games, just old laptop wich has been broke for long time. I tried mouse and keyboard on my friends Ps4 and holy hell it felt good and natural, even with high input lag and 60fps. It was incredible.

I'm currently saving money for PC setup, but as you might know. Getting money at this age is not easy. 

I'm going to build my own PC for the best price to  performance value. Current specs i'm saving for would be Gtx 1060 or 1070 ti (ti because cheaper than regular) with Ryzen 6 2600X Cpu. 16gb of 3000mhz(+) ram.

With that PC i could play on 144fps and also be able to stream. While getting better and pro level, streaming is something i would also do. Playing in tournaments would always be over streaming though.

I know i could get to top level on PC, i just can't stand being slower or clearly worse than anyone else. This is what makes me practice hard.

The whole PC setup including all 144hz monitor, mouse, keyboard and stuff like that would cost atleast 1500€. While i think 1500€ is not much for making my dream happen, getting that kind of money feels impossible. 

The problem also is not that my family is poor or anything, both my parents are quite whealty. They just don't want to spend much money for my gaming hobby and i somewhat understand that, but they don't know how much i really do want this.

I know i have the potential, but i just don't have the money. The struggle is real.

What can i do here? Nothing? I was first thinking about doing gofundme, but that would just feel selfish and getting actually people give me money would be hard. In order to GoFundMe work, i'd need either to be really damn good writer or make great video explaining my situation (wich i will probably try to do), but only thing i have is my smartphone.

While this might work well for some, it is not the fastest nor the most accurate method of splitting materials.

Here is how you should do it:
Your teammate drops half of his materials by highlighing a material in his inventory and pressing Z. Then you do the same in another spot. After that, you pick up your teammates half and he picks up your half.

As a demonstration, here is an example with some random numbers:
Your teammate has 700, 200 and 500 of their respective materials and you have 300, 600 and 400 of your respective materials.
By dropping half, your teammate will be at 350, 100 and 250 and you will be at 150, 300 and 200. Then when you go pick up your teammates half you will both be at 500, 400 and 450, which is exactly equal.

I have two problems that annoy me a lot

The first is my FPS when I build and it's been several weeks, I go from 150-250 fps without any drop to 30-40 when I build, it's impossible, I do the 90 without the eyes normally  

The second problem that goes well with the first and I have since today, when I sprint (sprint by default) by building it does not sprint anymore  

When I run in a straight line while doing stairs, the sprint works but as soon as I 90 degree the sprint does not work anymore  For losses of FPS, as soon as I have the lag, no matter what I do, I can not build without being at 40 fps, when I have the lag I can just edit fluidly, run, shoot , etc ... but as soon as I build I lose all my fps  

r/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEo-xbRdink (Look at the fps counter and there was nothing on my PC, just Fortnite and Shadowplay)  

In the video as you can see, I can no longer run during my 90's and I have fps losses when I build but when I'm editing or whatever, everything is fine  

About my config, etc ...:  i5-4460, 8GB RAM, GTX 1060 6gb, SSD with 710 GB available on 1TB, no virus  

Setting IG: 1080x1080 resolution, everything low, v-sync disabled, unlimited ips, when I play I close and disable all that is useless (services.msc, task manager, etc ...), I did every tuto that's increase the performance, I did absolutely everything and I have no problem of fps normally(between 150 and 300)

In my NVIDIA graphical settings, I put everything in maximum performance and not quality, I disabled everything that could be disabled (AA, etc ...) and I put everything in low. I turn between 150 and 300 fps but as soon as I have this fps lag, it is unplayable and as if it was not enough, I can run no more during my 90 degree now 

When I do not have this bug, I can stream with OBS, record with Shadowplay, play Fortnite, Google Chrome and discord at the same time without any loss of fps, it annoy me so much.

I realize you would need a new indicator to know where to move and where you are in elevation, but I feel this concept would prevent a lot of heal-offs and force more late game fights. Thoughts?

Making the competitive scene in Fortnite succeed is incredibly important to me, so I wanted to share some ideas on what I think needs to be done. I don't think the game being more competitive makes it automatically worse for the casual player, if you look at other big titles with a strong e-sports scene like CS:GO or LOL, the balance should always focus on the highest level of gameplay. People play games to win and get better, nobody even on the lowest level is trying to get worse or play bad on purpose, that's just the nature of games. I put a TL;DR in the bottom and will also soon make a post for weapon balance ideas if you are interested in that.

* **TURTLE META**

This is never going to change. As long as you can build for cover to avoid all incoming damage, people will make use of it and turtle up. There is no reason to not protect yourself with walls/floors. However overtuned explosives like nade launcher/rockets and C4 at it's strongest time were a really frustrating way to die. You can never know if your opponent has them and choses to pick you as his target to spam all of his explosives.

A much fairer way to deal with people that turtle up would be to give building priority for 0,15 seconds to the player/team that pickaxes a wall. (for comparison the current turbobuild speed is 0,05 seconds and shotgun draw speed \~0,2 seconds) So this means if an enemy pickaxes your wall, you can't build on that spot for 0,15 seconds which rewards the player taking the initiative. But it's not as punishing as getting spammed by explosives where you die right away. You still have the option to protect yourself with a ramp, or just go for the edit and take a shot first, you can also pickaxe his wall and take it back.

Sitting in a 1x1 and holding m1 isn't hard and shouldn't make you almost invincible. You are still fine if your enemy sprays with a rifle/smg, but if he goes for the risk of taking the wall with his pickaxe out, he will be rewarded if you stay passive and let him do it. A small change like this would be a good way to deal with the turtle meta because it allows for decision making compared to strong explosive which offer little to no counterplay.

* **FIRST SHOT ACCURACY**

For rifles it takes currently 0,3 seconds to get first shot accuracy, that's way too long in a fast paced game like Fortnite and you can't really use them except when you are shooting while sitting in a base/ behind cover. This is one of the reasons why almost every fight ends up in a close range build fight. You can use shotguns/smg's while jumping and running around but for rifles aswell as guns like the handcannon you have to be stationary for a very long time and become an easy target.

I would like to see a buff to FSA by reducing it down to 0,2 seconds and maybe even give it a 50% bonus when you crouch. (So you can't really benefit of that when trying to peek over a wall - but if you want to take some shots open field, you can quickly crouch and take shots)

In a competitive game nobody really dies early unless they get involved in a build fight where they can't back off. People can react and build really fast so after 1-2 shots they usually build cover to avoid more rifle damage. Faster FSA would lead to more medium range kills in the midgame, so we don't have to see competitive games where nobody dies until lategame like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9l873t/custom_squads_na_way_too_many_people_alive_with/)

* **INCENTIVE TO FIGHT**

Point systems are not the solution to meta problems. Even if you only give points for eliminations, it's the best way to get them consistently if you play passive go for position and then take kills by third partying or shooting teams in a bad spot. There is just no reason to engage another team in the open if they are on the same level, it's just a 50:50 fight and there is also the chance of getting third partied and wasting time not harvesting / rotating.

So my idea was to have an actual objective during the midgame that people would fight for. You can  call it golden llama or make it a special air dropp that always spawns in a certain location of the map - (if you want to make the location random then you make it visible on the minimap) It should also spawn at the same time, probably after the first storm circle closed in. The point is that everyone knows where and when they can find these.

It should be the only way to obtain ""broken items"" like C4, rift to go grappler... this way you don't have to vault powerful items, because you have to fight for those powerful items and if you make it get rewarded.

it doesn't even have to be implemented in the way i suggested, I just saw [this idea from xil](https://twitter.com/xilFN/status/1049537237703000064) which is the same concept

* **FIRST ZONE CIRCLE**

Seeing the first safe zone right at the start would add a very interesting dynamic to the game. Right now in  the competitive scene most teams get their spots uncontested, because they are known for going there. However if you know the first circle before you are on the bus it's very different how good a landing spot can be. It gives the players the decision to risk landing in a better position which they will be contested and lead to early fights between players who want to go for these, while others may land further away from the safezone and sacrifice more time running in. Right now the landing is often a big gamble and if you have to run far you often get into fights with other players trying to rotate which usually screws up the game for everyone involved in those fights

* **RIFTS**

I really liked the addition of rifts especially on the outer parts of the map, which makes them more viable as landing spot. However they should be spread out a bit more evenly [half of them are on the south east side](https://i.redd.it/agov28edj6p11.jpg) Also there should be always at least 1 rift spawned, otherwise you get screwed by unnecessary RNG.

* **HEAL OFFS**

I personally don't mind heal offs that much. They aren't as easy to execute (unless you have campfire, medkit + highground and teammates alive to protect you - which you usually don't get for free) and it often leads to epic moments where one enemy guy tries to grapple up to execute the healer, or the guy from above is out of heal and is under time pressure to kill the healer below But if you want to prevent them, we should simply have the final circle also close in from the top, This way the team with highground still has the advantage in fights, but is forced to make a move first.

* **PACE OF THE GAME**

Watching a competitive game doesn't have to be a constant highlight show, in fact this makes big moments not so special anymore and less interesting to watch. The pace of the game is a very important part in a competitive game and shoud rather tell a story, where you have most teams landing safely with a few of them fighting for good early spots - in midgame a few people fight for airdropps/highest tier loot - then in the end the climax with most action and eleminations. Casters can use the time early to talk about each teams position and situation to slowly build up the hype.

**TL;DR:** pickaxing a structure gives you priority in building for 0,15 seconds, make FSA faster, give OP items as incentive to fight during the mid game, show the first zone at the start of the map, make rifts more consistent, let the final circle close from the top",FortniteCompetitive

I believe buffing mats will fix the 40 people end game circles. Even with incentivizing kills, players aren’t going to push fights with low mats. This means they’re going to waste time gathering resources (a lot of time!). Once the resources are gathered, you’re then forced to spend time rotating, which again is more important than getting a kill even if that kill is incentivized. By the time everyone has rotated, so many people are in a such a small place, that it’s too dangerous to push anyone. 

If mats were buffed, not only would players rotate much quicker, they’d shy away from battles less for a couple reasons. 

1. Engagements would happen a lot sooner since people would be rotating faster. 

2. Players wouldn’t be as cautious to push someone knowing that they could regather mats after the battle a lot quicker. 

3. Players would be slightly less worried about being third partied since the battles would be a lot more spread out due to them taking place earlier in the match.

All of this results in end game circles that aren’t flooded with players being forced into fights while running from the storm and getting shot from 10 different directions. We would get to see more one on one battles and more displays of early/mid game skill.  ",FortniteCompetitive

I used to push with ramps or double ramps, I rarely really tried to get high-ground during buildfights because I was too lazy, I was dropping down intentionally because I preferred using a shotgun and didn't like fights that took too long, I never really used the tfue special (shotgun-floor) etc... All of that because I was too lazy.

I came back after 1month of not playing, everyone (lot of people at least) is decent especially at buildfight, after getting coned 4-5 times, I started building more efficiently and abusing edit plays (and most people in pubs are still not comfortable fighting against edits) 

I still find myself making dumb plays because of habit , find myself engaging the buildfight late because I am used to avoid them and I'm still trying to improve my poor decision making especially against duos/squads. My aim improved a bit causing less death early game but I still find myself not at 100%, unless I'm forced to (like sometimes facing an evenly good player, or when I need to save my teammates when  playing squads/duos.

Am I just not an enough competitive player? I like to improve my skill , winning and all but I enjoy it more when I do it with the least amount of effort basically (its my mentality in life tbh). 

Right now I'm just trying to get my first season 6 win in solos, while going for as many kills as I can (max 12 at the moment but keep dying).

The reason is simple, most of the SMGs apply more pressure than a P90 can.  
  
Green/Blue SMG DPS: 216/228  
Gold P90 DPS: 210  
  
Green/Blue SMG Reload Time: 2.3/2.2s  
Gold P90 Reload Time: 3s  
  
Green/Blue SMG Fire Rate: 12  
Gold P90 Fire Rate: 10  
  
Because of these stats, the Green/Blue SMGs can fire quicker and sneak shots through turbo build, while also firing magazine after magazine without letting an opponent get a mini-shield off since the time to drink a mini-shield is 3 seconds. They just can't heal between reloads typically so you can apply a lot of pressure without letting them re-heal on you.

I always thought this would be fixed, but now, outside of POIs it's a rarity. I feel like any place that has been updated at some point is guilty of this, and builds place into the ground. 

&amp;#x200B;

On the same note, a more subjective complaint is how the map is being shaped. For some reason Epic has decided to make the map more and more uneven, mountainous, and hilly throughout the past couple of months. In fact, I don't think I've played a game before that had so much uneven territory. If you look at the old spots, like fatal fields, the layout is designed to fit the grid with slopes going up a level and then flat ground; this gives intuition to the players as to the grids layout and where builds will place. I feel like this was a great design. I'm not asking for it to look like minecraft. I don't have a problem with uneven, hilly territory every here and there, but it's almost the entire map, outside of POIs. I don't really understand it. ",FortniteCompetitive

I opened task manager and noticed that the **Epic Games Launcher was using over 70% of my GPU**.

This is obviously not normal behavior. There was some kind of resource leak which caused the massive consumption of my GPU's resources that does not happen often. I updated my Nvidia drivers shortly before while Epic Games Launcher was still running so I'm thinking that might have been the cause. Updating video drivers without a restart can be hit or miss. I'll try to do more troubleshooting the next time it happens and see if I can confirm anything.

However, even when Epic Games Launcher is running ""normally"" in the background, it is still using a small percentage of the GPU (about 0.8-1.5% in my experience). While not major in any way, I would gladly take a free 1% performance gain and not have to worry about it affecting Fortnite's performance at all.

So if you guys have been having any issues with your game's FPS dropping randomly, try closing Epic Games Launcher. There's no need to have it running after launching Fortnite.

The tl;dr is: Killing players grants you a Llama Coin. This and a very small drop rate in supply drops are the only two ways of getting Llama coins, and dying does not drop any currently held llama coins. These coins can only be used at a new item Upgrade Chambers. These vending-machine-like objects are in SET and STATIC permanent locations in mainly named areas and **VISIBLE on the minimap from the start of the game** to allow for planning routes or rotations. However the rarities of these upgrade chambers indicate how cheap they are (and how rare they are on the map) . A gold Upgrade Machine would be 3 coins to use, a blue 5 coins, a gray 7 coins. Obviously landing/rotating near gold vending machines if in the circle would be ideal however there would only be two gold Upgrade Machines on the map in duos and squads. Each Upgrade Machine give you game-long perks that are UNIQUE and ONLY OBTAINABLE through these machines and upgrade a certain gameplay element of fortnite boosting your chances of survival in a substantial way but (hopefully) not overpowered.

Whenever it’s brought up we have one group saying we should nerf turbo building because 20 clicks per second (cps) is too much. It’s humanly impossible. We have the other group not wanting a nerf to turbo building because, well, it makes life a lot easier. 

I would propose something that meets in the middle to fix the problem of the invincible 1x1 warrior. I think taking away 20cps would be a bad change. It would regress gameplay and make things slower and clunkier. We should, however, make it so that you can’t turbo build the same wall over and over again. Let’s say you’re in a 1x1 and someone breaks your wall. You shouldn’t be able to hold down the build button to keep them out indefinitely. You should have to manually click in order to replace a wall that was just broken. Maybe make it so that turbo building won’t work in a spot until .5 seconds after a build breaks in that spot. This way you can still keep someone out of your 1x1 if you can click fast enough (mechanical skill), but the other person has a chance at breaking through. This way, you can still spin in a circle and build your 1x1 as fast as you can spin, and you can do the elaborate builds that wouldn’t be possible without 20cps turbo building, but you can't just play pencil warrior until you run out of materials. 

I don’t think people understand just how much building relies on turbo building these days. Pro's would not be able to build the way they do without it. Taking it away would be a HUGE change and I don’t think many people would like it. With my proposal nothing changes except that you can’t be invincible in your 1x1.

Let me know what you guys think of this idea.

This is pretty well known in other competitve fps games.

To simplify the difference between fullscreen and windowed mode is basically Fullscreen =  drawn gpu resource directly to screen = less resources used and nothing forced on the game Windowed Borderless = Using desktop window manager = slightly more resources used and forces a small amount of  triple-buffering  which causes input lag. 

Most people might not notice the input delay because they have always been playing on borderless mode and never tried fullscreen but if you play with fullscreen and switch back to windowed mode it is very obvious and definetly hinders your reaction. 

If you want to test this for yourself then play aimtastic (popup target) on steam in both modes and you should see your self scoring a lot higher on fullscreen mode compared to windowed mode. My worst result for popup target on fullscreen is better then my best result on windowed borderless mode. I noticed this because aimtastic has a bug atm were it starts up on windowed borderless mode every single time and has to be changed to fullscreen on every startup.

If you need to be able to alt tab frequently and or use third party crosshair for your game then you can use windows 7 and disable the feature causing the input delay because on windows 8 and 10 it is not possible to disable it. ",FortniteCompetitive

Okay i have made a post about this a while ago but since this issue is being talked about again it might be more relevent.


""So i was thinking of a way to incentivising kills within a game while still supporting the battle royale game type so that the person who has more kills are rewaded ingame and make it easier for them to win Instead the game atm is easier to win for the person who has avoided everyfight and got into end game circle with 3k mats and heals.""

Kill incentivice through points and systems outside does not change the core mechanics of the game so its still better to get to end game and get kills in the rotation.

So my Idea is :

To lower the mat cap to 700 and to increase the farming rate. ( To allow people to take early-mid game fights since they might be more comfertable with the mat count to fight) 

Each kill will increase the mat count cap by 50 which will then be capped at 999 at 6 kills. (so 150 mats total including wood/brick/metal) 

Getting 7 kills can unlock a heal slot ( this might be overkill so idk about this one)

I think this will be good enough to not include kill incentive out side the game which will also make it easier to follow the skirmishes. ",FortniteCompetitive

What do you think are the biggest issues in the state of the game right now?

I’ve watched a lot of scrims, been in scrims, and recently things seem to be different. Poach has been hitting on a few points and Tfue’s stream tonight was emphasizing a lot of nuances that have become the go-to strategy for players.

These include turtling and turbo building replacements, which make it near impossible to do anything. The heal-offs at the end of the game which are not only boring and RNG based, but reward virtually no skill at all—zero or one kill wins. Most times low-ground wins. Barrel stuffs with the double barrel. 

I love this game, and have recently fallen in love with trying to get better and be competitive against all levels of people.

I also think we are at an important crossroad and should voice our opinions for the community and the developers to see. Because the state of the game is in a strange place and as young as this type of Battle Royale is, it could pave the way for a very unfortunate future.

For me personally I think it would improve the game, overall. Less total mats means less time needing to farm them... and it also means you have to play smarter with your resources. You can't just turbo build spam forever, but actually consider the ""cost"" of using up mats in any given situation.

Of course, I also think it should be easier to obtain mats as well. So more mats given from loot drops, and more mats for destroying things. I think this would let people quickly max out their resources and then play smarter when using them. It would be okay to have less of each resource if you knew it wouldn't take long to gain them back from hitting a few things.

Just that in a fight or intense situation, you wouldn't have as much to work with, so you'd need to make good use of your mats. It would actually change up the meta quite a bit.

What do you think? Good idea? Bad Idea? Should we get even more mats? Should mats be even more limited than this? What is your take? I'd like to see some good discussion about this as I don't think it's in a perfectly healthy place right now and could be improved.",FortniteCompetitive

I don’t think the game needs bloom and I don’t think it makes the game “noob friendly” in fact I think it makes the game less noob friendly as anyone would expect to be able to hit their shots of they are aiming directly at their target.

I realize that FSA was added and to be honest it’s the one reason why I have stayed but can we talk about the pros and cons here of having some actual recoil besides bloom? 

I think a set recoil pattern would be better than bloom to be honest. 

Will pros be able to laser new players? Of course they will but pros will already shit on new players with the current mechanics so I feel like that argument is irrelevant.

I’m not asking for the gun to have perfect accuracy at 100 yards I’m just asking for more consistency.

With fortnite trying to go towards a competitive environment I think it would be a very good change. 

People are going to die anyways when they are out of position or make a stupid play so making the gun feel better in the hands of the shooter will only make the game more enjoyable and feel more polished.

I play other games like CSGO and overwatch and pretty soon will be playing BLOPS4. 

Fortnight has things these games ado not have and is an over all enjoyable experience besides the way to guns feel. They just feel so bad. Even when you get a kill it feels as though your gun arbitrarily decided to favor your aim in that one instance and I do not have bad aim. 

My favorite gun is the hand canon for obvious reasons. It just feels so nice knowing you are going to hit that flick shot to the head. I can calculate how much damage I’m going to do when that player peaks over his ramp and it just feels so much better than other guns Because it’s supposed to be used with FSA 

FSA in other guns just feels like a secondary feature that was added on later(which I guess it was.

Anyways I wish the guns had more character in the game. I wish there was a shining difference between ARs and SMGs but it’s more of just a grey area. Do I want to FSA from my base or spray? Because they both spray and SMG is more reliable is that instance unless I’m just shooting at structures. So the AR is really just a dumbed down snipe that I can ping a couple of FSA shots before the real battle begins and for that I’m just going to use my smg and shot gun every single time. 

I don’t know. Obviously this is just a rant.

Gunplay is by far the worst out of all the shooters I personally play and I think bloom is the culptrate.

I’m not asking for lasers I’m just asking for more consistency. 

I have 2000 wins at this point and enjoy building and trapping and all the fun that comes along with fortnite but better gunplay would be a welcome addition to the game and I think the pros definately outweighs the cons

235,purpletuce,1539027241,9mi3m0,27,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9mi3m0/great_news_for_fortnite_ranked/,1,Great News for Fortnite Ranked,"As far as I know, one of the biggest roadblocks to ranked in Fortnite is there isn't any successful ranked models for a battle royale. Simply put, if you just throw a system together, it probably won't work well and you'll probably have many issues that are hard to work around for a battle royale.   


I've thought one of the best ways for Fortnite to get around this issue was to make it a competition, possibly a Kaggle competition. Kaggle is a platform where data scientists, people who are experts at modeling data, compete to see who can create the best model. However, Fortnite was too slow, and PUBG already hosted a competition ([https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pubg-finish-placement-prediction)).  


This is still great news! The underlying issue of modeling a battle royale is still an issue being tackled here. Many of the same underlying relationships for success will still be fleshed out, and if Epic capitalizes on the knowledge made available from the competition (top solutions are always made public), they'll see a ton of lift.   


Why is this so important? Usually in a kaggle competition, early on a few strong models are made publicly available, and these models are a solid first pass at the data. Due to the nature of the competition, only strong starting models will rise to the top, and then quickly users will start improving them further. Each step of improvement will have new ideas and different approaches to the problem, and the iterative improvement will always compare to the 'ground truth' of the data.   


For a quick example of what kind of issue will be solved, consider how Overwatch ranked worked on day 1. After consecutive wins a user would start receiving more rank. Sounds simple, makes sense as a way for users who are ranked too low to quickly catch up. From a statistical point of view, it doesn't make any sense. A player with LLWWWWWW would get way more rank than a player with WWWLWWWL, even though the later lost in more difficult games.   


**TLDR**: Pubg is hosting a competition to effectively model a BR, and it'll probably be done well. Epic can take notes, and if they do they'll probably build a pretty solid system. ",FortniteCompetitive

The reason why i wanted to give a shot for 9-7 sensitivity was to get my edits bit faster and certain build / edit techniques easier. 

I played the whole day on 9-7 sensitivity and i noticed after some time that my aim was better and more consistent than it was on 8-6 sensitivity.  Flick shotting with shotguns was really easy and tracking with smgs worked well too.

I switched my Targeting sensitivity also from 0.45 to 0.40, so my ADS sens was only slightly faster than it used to be.

If you want to see my full notes here they are:

Here is the full video for when I reviewed and made these notes up:

Part one: [https://youtu.be/0tAqHN8VhNE](https://youtu.be/0tAqHN8VhNE)

Part two: [https://youtu.be/wePd8bUslyY](https://youtu.be/wePd8bUslyY)

Key points:

\- Dusty Divot, never using max shield, using mushrooms from 25 shield or 50 shield to get up to max.

\- Farming about 5/0/5 and moving to a preset loot path (Divot -&gt; Diner -&gt; Broken) gives opportunity for a lot of loot. This is incumbent on spotting diner droppers and making sure no one drops there - this gets broken later on when people start dropping diner in about game 3 or 4.

\- Psalm counting grenades is awesome and something everybody should try to do.

\- Both really good at staying on each other's tail in tough situations like getting nade spammed. But we can see in late game, Psalm is amazing at shadowing Bizzle and Bizzle is really good at keeping his tunnels open for Psalm and not blocking him at all. 

\- Split 1x1s to zone is really popular in duos right now when zoning early circles.

\- Communication is amazing, both are always acknowledging decisions. We rarely hear any decision made that is not being acknowledged. 

\- Another point on communication: Important decisions are always just made and never a huge discussion about it, ""I'll stay ultimate high"" ... ""I'll heal""... "" let's try to push into zone instead of using launchpad""... these circles are now moving so fast that this is a big positive of their comms and decisions. They aren't always making the CORRECT decision as we see in game 5 with the launchpad for zone, but they are making a decision together, and that's more important than making the right decision.

\- Scoped AR is amazing when you get the early rotation and mid circle positioning. Just fantastic, Bizzle gets like 3 or 4 kills before moving zones in Game 3 because of early rotate with scoped ar.

\- Question: Is it worth to take chip damage at a long range like in this game, even though you won't get the kills.. Say you have the ammo and you are safe taking shots… is it worth?

\- Another point about following each other, you'll see these guys almost never fall behind each other when snaking into new zones or going for height BUT when Psalm does fall behind one time, Bizzle slows down and waits, this is AWESOME.

\- Late game snake that is not theres, they both immediately make decision to slow it down and wait, and keep pump out, because they cant build and take time to take all the walls - this ends up in a kill in game 3. Really awesome play and watching this happen real time is cool.

\- Looking for holes for splodes is fantastic, bizzle is really good at spotting these and Psalm is great at threading the needle.

\- Last huge point: They are fantastic at getting crossfires and looking for two angles to shoot from - almost never will they spam the same wall, but they will find an angle to shoot two walls at least. They split on high ground to get different angles, they split even when they are in the same snake/turtle to get different angles. This is a huuuuge concept in most teamgames that I think is overlooked - looking for crossfires. Psalm and Bizzle are AMAZING at this.

Game 5 [https://youtu.be/wePd8bUslyY?t=1480](https://youtu.be/wePd8bUslyY?t=1480)

They unfortunately don't make it into game 6 but still secure 2nd place, if this didn't happen they may have gotten first. Unfortunate.

Hope this is beneficial guys, happy learning!

P.S. I think this may be the best way to post these VOD reviews, as key points with timestamps to the video rather than just the video - this way you don't necessarily have to watch the review right away, and there is possibility to skim. Let me know what you guys think and if you can think of a better way to post this type of content. I think IDEALLY I would edit down the VOD review to key points, but I think people would also be interested in the full thing.

I am sick of being top 10 and seeing 10 turtles while all I wanna do is fight. But guess what since I am not poach I am just not good enough to pick a fight and then getting 9th partied. Fighting is what makes this game fun, but when people play for wins lategame becomes horribly boring. In the off chance you do get a kill, you use up mats and shield and there will be someone pushing you afterwards, lowering your chances during the next fight.

We need a kill incentive. Or something that punishes turtling or makes it harder. Right now the only positive outcome in a game is the win. Getting 10 kills might be nice for your kd, but it doesn‘t matter when the last guy somehow kills you after a tough fight and takes the win with like two kills.

It would also make competitives games more exciting. It really is the fact that Season 6 has become very campy lategame and everybody is just looking to third party. Which makes it so when you are forced to fight because of a bad zone, you technically both lose.

Prime example was a game I played earlier, guy had high ground on a hill and circle spawned on him. It was around Risky, I was low on mats and there was another guy next to me. We wait till last second and go, are forced to fight and the dude with highground just spams down and eventually takes the win.. with 1 kill and full shield/health. I don‘t know why this is so much worse in Season 6 but it really is.

I’m kind of torn between these sensitivities because I’ve seen great players use both. I know Tfue and Mongraal use a pretty low sens. But guys like Mitr0, Mortaz, and the Liquid guys use a pretty high sens while maintaining their accuracy. 

I’m leaning toward upping my sensitivity and really train my aim. I want to be able to build comfortably and aim comfortably.

The fov advantage helps so much. Building feels so much more fluid because youre not ""cramped"". Your builds are shorter and wider which just helps a lot.

I have no qualms with the pellet spread or base shotgun damages and I understand that the two (2) second delay when switching between shotgun shots was added in order to prevent double pumping. however I do believe that having to wait an entire 2 sec in the middle of a fight to shoot because i have 2 shotguns and swap mid fight is absurd. My suggestion; make the swap delay the same as the fire rate of the shotgun that i am swapping to i.e. if i shoot a pump shot and swap to a tac shotgun i should not need to wait 2 seconds but only wait 0.67 second (tac shotgun fire rate) so on and so forth with the other shotgun combinations. I believe this is the right course to take in order to address the double pump problem. This would allow players to carry bothe desired weapons at the same time as a heavy shotgun is vastly different from the double barrel.

&amp;#x200B;

In competitive Fortnite, materials are the most important thing, they are more important than weapons. So maybe nerfing them in a good way, could help to give an kill motivation. 

So my idea is:

you can at max hold 300/300/300 materials that you farmed yourself. Any additional ressource you want, has to be gathered through killing. If an opponent has less than 100/100/100 you will receive a fixed 100/100/100. If you used those self-farmed materials you can of course go and farm again. That all should work with the FIFO (First in - First out) principe. So after you gathered 900 mats and got another 500 from a player after that you use your self farmed materials first, so you can quickly start farming again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to hear opinions about that, i dont say this is the best solution etc. but it COULD be a solution or at least a point where you can start to improve, as I am a big defender of not giving too many points for killing in a BR game. BR is surviving. And ideas for improving this idea are very welcomed.

I also struggle with small adjustments, on console because the deadzone makes my aim go from too slow to too fast and on PC because im terrible with a low sens (this is more of an experience problem).

The thing with this though is that practicing in playground runs is on stationary targets when only you will be moving. Which imo isnt very helpful now that jumpshots will be useful to land in every single game against other players that are moving. I also find myself shooting too early and whiff the ADS shots on the PS4 aim assist. 

What are your tips? Sensitivity? Better to wait and get a good shot, play on angles or just try to get the first shot out every time?

I play on 600 DPI 0.09 on PC and 7/6 on PS4 for reference.

When you watch scrims, players avoid hot dropping another team at all costs, since they would rather take the time to loot, get some materials, and then go into a fight knowing they'll be okay. So I tried to determine if there was enough viable loot spots to support 100 players in a match. I tried to give every person between 4-6 chests and 15-20 floor loot spots.

In solos, I found roughly 92 spots that would be viable drop spots, and even 4 or 5 of those are dry on loot. I'm attaching the map with the drop spots numbered. Feel free to ask in the comments, as some drops (especially in the northeast) have players hitting several smaller houses for loot.

[Solo Drop Spots](https://i.redd.it/u4mvkwqn6uq11.jpg)

In duos, I only found 44 spots that would be viable, with several those still leaving teams in shambles or very spread out while looting several spots. In duos, it's tough because if you land spread from your teammate and don't get a chest or a good gun off the first spot, another team close by can always push you and then you're SOL. Let me know if there are any other viable spots for duos to drop. 

[Duo Drop Spots](https://i.redd.it/m0ub37ujeuq11.jpg)

In squads, I actually believe there's 29 possible squad drops. But 5 of them would leave a team very spread out and/or short on loot in comparison to other teams.

[Squad Drop Spots](https://i.redd.it/emz13r2thuq11.jpg)

The 5 spots I thought may be viable, but would be worse in comparison to the 24 were: Containers, Soccer Field, Motel, Chair/Bridge/House on the Hill &amp; Forest south of Haunted. Containers only contains 8 chests and 23 floor loots. It does have a vending machine, but you'd have to get lucky to walk away with enough loot for a 4 man squad. You would have plenty of materials, and possibly could rotate to get shrooms, but it's not as strong as many other drops. Soccer Field &amp; Trick Mountain (and that house just east of Soccer Field) would give you 8 chests and 39 floor loot spots, but it has 2 vending machine spawns. You'd leave with a solid amount of materials as well, but other drops have more loot for a 4 man squad. Motel (paired with Umbrella and the house to the west) would would give you 10 chests and 27 floor loot spots, and again you'd have access to materials, and again, you would have a vending machine. The Chair, the Circle of Life Tree hill, the bridge to the east and the House on the Hill would have to combine into 1 drop for a squad, leaving them very spread out (about 1 minute of sprint time between the farthest teammates). You would have a chance at 14 chests, and there are some materials in the area (metal at the chair &amp; bridge, rock under the bridge and some trees) and you would have two vending machine spawns. It's plausible, but you'd be very spread out and all it would take is one squad pushing early for an easy kill to lose a teammate. The last one is probably the least viable, with the team having to split between the house south of Haunted, the Rocket Base and that house west of Pleasant, for a total of 7 chests. You would have mushrooms and a decent amount of materials, but you would be so split with so little loot that it likely wouldn't work.

**TL;DR: There are roughly 92 safe spots for a solo pro player to drop, 44 spots for a pro duo to drop and 24/29 for a pro squad to drop.** 

Would love to hear what you guys think, if there's spots I missed, if there's spots that wouldn't be good enough for a drop. Let me know where you think the contested spots will be and where the best drops are. Is having so many safe spots good for competitive Fortnite, since it means teams can get enough loot and materials to be even matched when they get into a fight, or is it bad since it means that teams can get their loot and materials and avoid fights until late game. Is it bad that there's not enough safe &amp; viable drops for every team and it means some spots will be contested, or is it good since then you can never take it easy early game?

Also, please comment with where pro players you watch drop. I know some from the scrims that I watch, but don't know every team and would love to know where they're dropping and how the competitive drop map looks at this time.",FortniteCompetitive

**1. Performance**

After some updates the game feels like it's not running 60fps consistently wich is terrible. Also there is sometimes big framedrops during fights wich makes it imbossiple to aim. The overall performance is much worse and the game feels way more sluggish than even on regular Ps4. Just to add that even regular Xbox One looks smoother than my One X.

Performance inconsistency and overall optimization is due to bad optimization and really high resolution and graphic settings wich i'd like to tune down for more consistent performance. Why don't we have setting for 1080p? 

**2. Strong graphics, shadows and motion blur**

I've read that Xbox One X graphics are around the same as Epic setting on PC. This makes things like sunset and sunrise literally make you blind. 

Shadows are also pretty much same as Epic on PC. In some places i can't see shit and that costs me the match. Option to turn off shadows would be huge and while i know some other consoles got shadows too, they're nowhere near as strong.

Motion blur is really, i mean really strong on Xbox One X wich is HUGE didvantage for me, even against regular Xbox One players. I can't focus well in shotgun fights due to the crazy amount of motion blur. There needs to be setting for this.

**3. Xbox Bugs**

Both Xbox One and Xbox One X has way more bugs than Ps4, many of them are ""gamebreaking"" or give you big disvantage. 

First one is screen getting black or brown (happens mostly in Tilted). This makes impossoble to see anything.

 *Heres example of screen getting black:*

Audio bugs is another big problem, sometimes i don't hear when people are gliding close to me or even landing on me, this can cost me the match. Also i literally never hear my opponents RPG sound correctly, the audio just cuts off.

There is alot more bugs on Xbox like buildings not loading wich are trurly gamebreaking. 

°

I'm really competitive player and being at disvantage against Ps4 and even regular Xbox One players is really annoying. This shouldn't be the case. I'm saving money for PC setup, but wont be getting it soon. I have only 100€ saved atm.

If you're using stretched resolution, you may be able to overclock your monitor to increase its refresh rate. I was able to go from 1440x1080 144hz to 165-170hz stable by changing my desktop resolution, here's how to do it.  

Go to Nvidia control panel and click on change resolution, then click on Custom resolution. Set the resolution to your Fortnite resolution, then slowly up the refresh rate and confirm it to test for stability. I would go in increments of 3-5hz. Make sure your monitor is stable (there aren't any striped lines or discoloring or dots everywhere, etc). Save the custom resolution and re-apply 1920x1080.  

Next, go to Adjust desktop size and position in Nvidia control panel, and choose Full Screen, Perform scaling on GPU.  

Next go to your Fortnite Config location (C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient\GameUserSettings.ini) and change every ""1920"" to ""1440""(Or whatever res you've decided on) and set ""FrameRateLimit"" to the refresh rate you found stable. Save the file and make it read only.  

Lastly go back to Nvidia control panel and click on Change resolution, Click on your custom resolution with custom refresh rate and click Apply. Start up fortnite. If all goes well you should be playing Fortnite at a higher refresh rate. Only cons of this are that you'll have to apply the custom resolution every time you start the game and I'm not sure how it will work if you're streaming. If you have a 60hz monitor, you might be able to go to 75-80 hz, which is a really drastic difference (I played CS on an overclocked 60hz monitor, believe me when I say it's worth it). If you don't want to change your desktop resolution then hey, no harm no foul.

As a viewer since the first skirmish I find it ridiculous that the transition from the summer skirmish to fall skirmish barely improved on anything, and in fact worsened it in some regards. Here are the main issues in my opinion:


* Lack of communication/info about the skirmishes - It is quite frankly bizarre that Epic don't release more information about who is playing and what format the games are sooner so that the viewer can find out who to follow etc. Not just the viewer but players as well - who they can play with in order to practice more.
* Scoring system - Despite having last summer skirmish as a test it seems that Epic didn't listen and are still set on using these weird formats that often encourage more people alive late game and therefore more lag. How about using one of the many good scoring systems people on this sub have suggested? These scoring systems actually encourage less consistency and so a team can have a great game then do nothing for the rest of the skirmish and do better than a team that consistently gets a few kills and places in the top 10 each game but is rewarded with few or no points as a result.  

* Choosing the players - It is astonishing to me in the lack of consistency when picking team captains. For instance, this week Epic picked content creators as captains. Fine, but at least pick ALL content creators instead of some pros. This is really strange and if I was competing I'd be angry at the unfair advantage some teams have with the amount of money on the line.

* Clubs - I don't know who's idea it was to implement the club system but it has just made things more convoluted. As a more avid viewer I am unaware as to which players are in different clubs, and I imagine it's extremely confusing for the more casual watcher of the skirmishes. It also limits the pool of players that people can choose from when picking teams - this is big for the many teams that have been scrimming for months and can no longer play together.

* Casters - I can't believe after all the feedback received that Zeke is still casting. Subjectively I like many others find his personality grating, but objectively he constantly gets things wrong like players who are alive or dead, as well as wrongly pronouncing players' names and having a general lack of info and awareness about the game and players competing. There really needs to be someone who is more switched on and has a better knowledge of the game. You've given Zeke more than enough opportunities and he just doesn't cut it.

* Viewing experience - Being able to hear players communicate via their in game audio was much better. Also, the fact that it is so hard to keep up with who is alive and who is dead is a problem, it makes it harder for the viewer when rooting for their favorite players. Also, I can't believe how slowly it takes to bring up leaderboards - This for the viewer is bad enough but for the players who have finished game 5 and going into game 6 with no idea of where they stand is unacceptable. Either find a way to calculate scores quicker or take slightly longer and then show the leaderboard between games.


These are the main problems I could think of anyway, I'm sure I've missed loads out. Would be interested on any feedback you have and solutions to any of the problems I brought up.",FortniteCompetitive

Firstly because players will suddenly be trying to build battle you every fight as well as spam build a soon as they are shot. This will reduce the chance for high kill games as fights will take longer.
 Secondly the gap between skilled players will reduce since i presume most higher skill players will be playing on roughly the same sensitivity to build as you no longer have to account for aim when choosing sensitivity. This will mean fights will be about who gets highground first or what gun you have. So every fight will become a playground essentially.
Finally (personally) I like the grind to get good with your new sensitivity and the feeling when you start hitting shots and get good with it. However this feeling isnt shared by everyone so I can see why you would disregard it.",FortniteCompetitive

1. The club system, it's insanely annoying. In the duo events many players are forced to play with people who they've rarely if ever played with and who more often than not are not even good at the game. To play with your duo first one of you has to get invited and second you have to be in the same club. And those who get to play with their standard duo have an unfair advantage over those who don't. I'm tired of players being held back because of their teammates.

2. No more listen ins / facecam of participants, only caster mode all of the time. 
They should clearly mix it up imo, it would create a way better atmosphere to hear the players talk when they're in a fight. Caster mode should only be used every now and then to give an overview of the battlefield.

3. Zeke thinking he's a comedian 
 I don't think Zeke is a problem as long as they would invite a co commentator with deep knowledge of the game every week. Zeke could ask questions on behalf of the audience in appropriate situations and always get top level answers. They should stop trying to be funny all the time and rather focus on the competitive aspect. Yesterday it was the same after every game: Zeke saying that Kitty is Nostradamus and that she predicted an 18 kill game, which we could potentially see in the next game.

4. Lag at the end of each game
Since they use the skirmish to determine which formats are entertaining and best for competitive I don't get why they don't at least in 1 week majorly incentivize kills to see what happens. They should do this now since the server performance is not good enough currently to handle the end game in a small circle and they have nothing to lose.

I really hope they learn from their mistakes for the next event series and make it not invite only and not noob/pro duo events. Showdown Royale can't come soon enough btw",FortniteCompetitive

Overwatch has an amazing custom crosshair system, it's extremely easy to use and you can configure different crosshairs to each hero. Why can't we have the same thing for Fortnite, but where you configure different corsshairs to different weapons (rifle, axe, shotgun, etc.).

391,airshowCSGO,1538833823,9lw2qf,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9lw2qf/idea_for_fortnite_ranked_mode/,1,Idea for Fortnite Ranked mode,"Hey,

&amp;#x200B;

With the discussion coming up that Epic Games should implement ranked mode and that they might've already done it I came up with some suggestions for it.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, make it like in CS:GO where you have Casual and then Competitive. Making the game fun to play when you are not in the mood to grind and try your best.

A lot of people might say that this is a bad idea because queue times will suffer but the thing is I doubt it. Sure maybe with a minute or something but when you look at CS you have like 2 min queue times for the 5 most popular maps on Competitive and that game has a lot of different game modes.

&amp;#x200B;

With ranked mode being in a different queue, I would like some gameplay changes in it like having materials be easier to gather like in Blitz since the higher ranks you go the more building there will be. This will also encourage newer players to use their materials and not to be scared to waste it.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's have a civil discussion, thank you.",FortniteCompetitive

In season 6 after the removal of Bouncers, RPGs can cause constant fall damage, as it gives people no time to react compared to shooting it down.

A lot of people will argue that it is supposed to be powerful because it is a Legendary/Epic item, but no other item in the game have the power to win you fights just by having the item; a P90 can never win you a fight singlehandedly, nor a SCAR or Heavy shotgun - as they do what common items do in the game, but just do it with greater power/fire rate.

If you've been watching his recent fortnite streams, you would have come across one of these phrases:  
""I just can't do it""  
""I will never be \_\_\_\_"" (a good builder, like them, ....)  


When Poach suggested Shroud toggle auto-run on, Shroud insisted his pinky must be doing something and that he absolutely can't do it, he tried and couldn't do it.   


What posseses such a mechanically gifted gamer to give up so easily? Is he simply claiming he can't do it as to avoid the embarassment if he actually tries but fails? How did he arrive at his current skill level with this mentality?  


I don't watch much Shroud, maybe this is a function of his personality and why viewers (for whatever reason) enjoy watching him.  


Lastly, how is he?  I frequently hear comments along the lines of ""There's a lot of people that can build better and faster than Tfue, but his aim is the reason he's the best""  Do you think he has the potential to be the best? ",FortniteCompetitive

At this point though, I'm resigned to the skirmish set up being the closest we get unfortunately. I find it really disappointing if this is the case because Fortnite clearly doesn't need more exposure at this point, there's really no need to invite content creators who have no place in competitive play. 

Does anyone still believe Epic will eventually go with a more traditional esports scene down the line? Or is comp lite as good as it's going to get for the game?",FortniteCompetitive
402,bobbychan193,1538791984,9lsh0v,60,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9lsh0v/lets_talk_about_highdistortion/,1,Let's talk about HighDistortion,"**Essay warning, so here's a TL;DR: Stop trash-talking HD. The Summer and Fall Skirmishes are to a certain extent imbalanced, unfair, and not an accurate representation of his skill and potential. If you watch him, you rarely see him choke or misplay. He usually gets held back by his teammate or just random BS. Also, Epic should fix their servers, let players play with people they're comfortable with, and stop adding bullshit items to the game.**

I've been watching HD since last December. Big fan. In the past the comp sub has generally been nice about HD, but I've started seeing people trash-talking on him in the skirmish discussion threads.

**Remember Camills?** When people were trash-talking on Mills every day during the Fortnite Friday era, the hate got to him. His mentality and skill both stagnated, and he eventually got benched. I'd hate to see the same thing happen to HD now that he's a signed pro, especially given how he is already so critical of himself. (If you ever watched his streams before, you've probably seen ""trash can"" or ""worst player on Twitch, don't watch"" in his stream titles. Or when someone trash-talks in chat he goes ""I know I'm bad. Go watch someone else."" And you know he's being serious.) **So, let's set some things straight before anyone trash-talks him without understanding the full picture.**

In case anyone's unfamiliar with Jimmy a.k.a. HighDistortion, he's a former Gears of War pro who signed with TSM as a streamer/content creator back in January. After his contract expired he was a free agent for 2 months or so, then decided to resign with TSM, this time as a pro.

**HD has immense potential to be a top competitor, but he's always getting held back by either 1. his teammate or 2. getting unlucky (read: random fucking bullshit). I'm going to cite actual examples from the Summer and Fall Skirmishes.**

So under the teammate category we have, most recently, Basicallyidowrk and LeopardTTV. I'm not saying either of them are bad players; HD simply didn't mesh well with them. If you've watched HD's streams, you probably know ""HDK"". Even though HD and DK are on different servers, they have phenomenal communication and synergy. You can tell that HD is comfortable playing with DK, and they often just goof around and have a good time. Simply put, HD didn't have the synergy or communication with DoWrk or Leopard as he has with Dakotaz, and that's what held him back in the skirmishes.

HD doesn't need the best player as a teammate in order to succeed; he needs someone he can mesh well with. When he duo'ed with Hysteria, who I'd consider to have decent chemistry with HD, they placed 15th.

When he was Valkyrae during Week 6, she held him back. They never played together prior to practicing a few games before the Skirmish, and they didn't have good chemistry. She was almost always the first to go down, leaving HD in 1v2 situations. In their best game where they got 8 kills, she had 1 kill and got sniped by poking her head out whereas HD had 7 kills into top 13. They placed well, getting 11th, but HD could've placed much higher if he had a teammate who worked with him better.

When he was with Annialis, who plays on controller, they had great communication. They worked well together and slayed out multiple games, placing 8th and 20th during Week 5 and 7, respectively. Keep in mind a lot of the other duos during Week 5 were pro duos: Vivid/Poach, both Ghost duos, Tfue/Cloak, Nate Hill/Funkbomb, etc. **So again, HD doesn't need to be carried. He can very much pull his weight. He just needs a teammate who can work well with him and communicate, like Annialis or Cloak.**

**Speaking of Cloak, now let's talk about the ""random fucking bullshit"" category.** Some of these things are incredibly frustrating to see as a viewer, let alone to experience as HD himself. In one of the Summer Skimish's earlier weeks, he teamed up with Cloak. With Cloak's incredible game sense and both of their combined skills, they were arguably one of the strongest duos. Well guess what? Epic's servers shit the bed so bad, stuff like [this](https://clips.twitch.tv/GorgeousWrongGorillaCclamChamp) happened.

During Twitch Rivals in the Summer Skirmish, Twitch made a mistake. HD was on the list of content creators they were supposed to invite. I believe HD was either still a streamer for TSM or a free agent at the time, so there was no way in hell he'd be confused with a signed pro. And yet, Twitch missed him. He had to get invited by Valkyrae and Annialis to even play. HD said on stream that Twitch apologized, that it's whatever and he doesn't really mind, but if I were him I'd be pissed. A mistake on Twitch's behalf cucked him for two straight weeks and potentially cost him a ton of money in winnings. Just imagine if he was the one who could invite Cloak or one of the Liquid guys instead of hoping to get invited.

The Season 5 meta was not friendly to HD (or anyone else for that matter). HD is a very audio-reliant player, as he has played for years in other games where audio is key for finding players. HD has had countless deaths where he can't fucking hear other players because of the garbage audio. Oftentimes he just dies to C4 or explosives without even knowing from where. HD has said on stream that this puts him at a disadvantage, as he is so conditioned to rely on audio that it ends up screwing him more often than helping him. He thinks other players who have Fortnite as their first pro game and haven't had years of pro gaming experience don't have such a strong reliance on audio. He thinks that in a sense these players have an advantage over him, and I agree.

This one is more recent, but a general problem that affects everyone, not just HD. For this week's Fall Skirmish, multiple captains were actually signed pros or pro-level. Here's some examples: psalm, Anthony, G2 RazZzero0o, and Solary Hunter. These guys get to pick another pro, or even their pro duo partner (Anthony and Joeseph, and Hunter and Kinstaar), completely unbalancing the playing field.

**Finally, let's constructively talk about how Epic can fix things so that HD and others can have a better time during these Skirmishes.** I understand that the skirmishes are for ""testing"" and trying out different formats, but there's no reason to divide players into meaningless ""clubs"", as they only restrict the pool that players can choose partners from. Players can't play at their best if they don't have a partner they're comfortable with and work well with. Even if they're adamant about having duos of content creator + pro, **Epic needs to give the players freedom of choice for their partner.** Otherwise some people will get lucky and pick someone they work well with, while others end up with a stranger and can't work together properly. That just seems inherently unfair.

**Also, Epic really needs to do something about the goddamn lag.** HD has said on stream he gets literally headaches playing on a console with 60 FPS. I can't imagine how much he is held back when playing in a tournament at low FPS and high ping. One solution is investing in better servers. If for whatever reason that's not possible for a company making hundreds of million dollars a month, then Epic should increase kill incentive to make final circles less laggy. [Here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9lpki8/na_fall_skirmish_5_october_2018_info_live_match/e78sapb/) what Parallax says about this.

**Last but not least, Epic needs to fix Fortnite's terrible audio and stop introducing bullshit items to the game.** They've said they're working on it, but we're six seasons in, so we'll see how much improvement really gets done. And again, the Season 5 meta was not friendly to HD (or anyone else for that matter). Early game RNG, i.e. whoever gets a drum gun and C4, and the spray and pray meta should not be the sole determinant of a fight's outcome. Luckily, Epic has toned down some of the most imbalanced weapons by either vaulting or nerfing them. However, I really hope they don't do the same exact thing in Season 6. Or if they do, at least have a 1-2 week testing period in public matches before adding them to competitive skirmish matches.

All they have to do is watch a single custom squad match, I watched Nate Hill playing one a few days ago and the lag was absolutely unbearable (same as Week 1 summer skirmish). So either they will somehow drastically improve the servers until next friday or they will ridicule themselves in unprecedented fashion. When the zone was already pretty small, 80 players were still alive and the game ended in a heal off with 30! players still alive and that was with no money on the line. So even if they somehow manage to get rid of the lag, every game will be decided by which squad finds the most medkits and campfires. The only way to counter that would be to only give points for kills and close to none for placement, and I think all possible scenarios would be insanely boring to watch. I'd be stunned if they don't change the format in the coming days to solo or duo, but if they don't it will be hilarious to watch the casters completely ignore the lag and make players look stupid by saying ""ohh X was lost in the storm..."" or ""he messed up his edit there"".

I’ve been watching him for a few years and I love his drive and really appreciate how he handles his community. I also think he’s a great role model for young kids as well.

Now, one of Nick’s best attributes IMO is his competitiveness. He always finds away to get it done and step up. With that being said, it’s clear that his building isn’t even close to the level needs to be. Yes, I understand his strengths and his accomplishments thus far, but how doesn’t NICKMERCS absolutely grind playground to at least improve his building? I’m pretty sure it’s not that he doesn’t care, because he always tries to compete at the highest level in every game.. so what is it? Even if he had people teach him on stream in playground for an hour per stream? 

Like I said, I love Nick to death, but he’s falling behind even more due to his lack of building (and no I’m not just saying this because of today). Half the players I see in pubs are mechanist superior to him in terms of building. It really doesn’t make sense to me tbh. 

Last, to make things clear; I’m not saying that he needs to completely switch his playstyle by any means. But at least having the tools readily available to compete at the highest level shouldn’t be too much to ask should it? 

Let me know your guys thoughts!

TLDR; Why doesn’t Nick work on his building more? Lol",FortniteCompetitive

So today was the grand opening for the esports program at ky college, the university of Akron in Ohio. They had many different tournaments throughout the day, which were executed pretty well for the hectic turn out. 

The fortnite event, which my brother and I competed in was very interesting. Now keep in mind, this was completely free to join and play in, and we used one of the three esports facilities that are now on campus. Which are beautiful. There was a pretty food turnout, right around 60 players competed. Everything was held through PC, but console players were allowed to bring their controllers to connect and use, which was very nice because my brother and I are both console. 

Roles/Point system:
-Each person was allowed 5 solo games total, the first two were your warm up games, the final three were your official scored games. After a game completed you had to remain in the lobby until a assistant confirmed your place and kill count. 
-scoring was based off both position towards end game as well as kills. 
-eaxh kill was worth 2 points 
-place in top 10 had a point value
   1st=35 points
   2nd=30 points
   3rd= 25 points 
   4th=20 points
   5th=15 points
   6th= 10 points
   7th= 8 points 
   8th= 6 points
   9th= 4 points
   10th= 2 points 

Obviously, placement had a huge role in gaining massive points, which I am not sure how I felt about it. It was too easy for people to camp for the top 5 spots for easy points without engaging at all, which to me isn't a judgement of skill, but it is a strategy none the less for this type of tournament set up. I play fairly aggressive, so it made me rethink how I wanted to play, but I stuck with my normal play style, maybe a little more conservative. I ended up placing 4th and my brother got 3rd, which we were both very happy with being console players on the PC servers. What was even cooler was that a kid around 12 years old ended up winning it all, which was very cool to see. He was an amazing player and everybody was cheering for him as he entered the final circle. Regardless of where anybody placed, it was cool to see the support for each other when we were all competing against each other. 

Just thought I would share this with you guys. It's really cool seeing competitive gaming growing even more and now making an appearance at our local college, and allowing people to pursue it even more. Would love to hear what your thoughts are, or feel free to ask any questions. Anybody else had any experiences like this?

You don't see them once in the late game, because they're redundant weapons heavily outmatched by SMG's, Assault Rifles and Shotguns in practically all ways. The only benefit is the very quick first-shot accuracy, though you're not gonna be using it at range - that's for sure.

I would much rather walk into a house, find an AR/Shotgun/SMG over a pistol any day. The suppressed pistol(s) are the same - they're never used, though do provide the benefit of being 'silent'. They're a waste of floor space, honestly.",FortniteCompetitive

I consider myself a pretty big Fortnite esports fan, having watched almost every Friday Fortnite and Summer Skirmish. However, I’ve watched ZERO Fall Skirmish because the format is so ridiculous. Please give the fans what they WANT, which is to root for competitive orgs. This is an important time for the game since Blackout is coming out and you have to compete for viewers with LoL Worlds. 


SQUADS


25 competitive squads compete over 6 games. 


Invite the 15 top pro orgs (based on earnings for now) and 10 additional captains by invite, qualifiers, or an application system. 


Additional captains can be free agents and content creators to allow players like Morgausse, Symfuhny, etc. to participate. Invite popular streamers like Shroud, timthetatman, and the massive Spanish speaking streamers to apply. You want people like Lirik, DrDisrespect, and Summit in the skirmish for the game to keep momentum. 


Team captains/owners pick their rosters with up to two subs (6 max). 


Scoring: 1 point per kill, 3 points for 1st place, 2 points for second place, 1 point for 3rd.


Example hype NA lineup below. Do the same for EU. Pro orgs can field teams in both regions. 


Liquid
FaZe
Ghost
NRG
TSM
Luminosity/Ninja
Cloud9
Pittsburgh Knights
100T
NV
Optic
Complexity
Morgausse
Reverse2k
Tendons
Symfuhnny
Typical Gamer
....etc by applicant/invite


At the end of the year, have a NA vs EU LAN event with the best 12 teams from each region. 


Please have the tournaments on SATURDAY. Have your esports team work Thu-Mon like how some restaurants stagger weekend shifts and take Tue-Wed off. I’ve worked in gaming, no one wants to work weekends, but you need a dedicated esports team if you aim to host tournaments. Tell me you wouldn’t watch this!

so,

I've gotten used to getting the occasional ghost hitmarker here and there but nower days I get them in almost every single fight that I'm in. They occur mostly with shotguns and the deagle but also with ARs in some instances.

For those of you who dont know what I mean with 'ghost hitmarkers' it basically means a blank hitmarker with no damage actually dealt. Technically your gun doesn't go off but the game lets you think that it did. This is really infuriating.

The most common cause for ghost hitmarkers is switching guns 'too fast'. So let's say I fire my shotgun and then immidiately switch to a secondary weapon. For some reason half the time the game doesn't quite keep up and the initial shot with the shotgun doesn't deal any damage.

Okay, now the answer to my complaints is usually something like: ""Just don't switch your guns too fast"". My problem with this argunent is that I get feedback from the game that implies my shot just connected. I can hear my gun go off, I can see the hitmarker. After that I'm not going to sit there and wait around for the game to process the hit. 

This simply shouldn't be a thing.

Epic needs to adress this issue and fix it. I don't know a lot about the technicalities that create this issue but surely it can be optimized better. ",FortniteCompetitive

I don't have a gaming PC thats remotely modern and fell out of gaming for years. I started playing Fortnite BR on my PS4 and used a mouse and keyboard. I've been struggling with aim and sensitivity. So I took a pro player input as a baseline. 

Example pro player = 400 dpi, .09 sens.

I programmed my mouse to 400 dpi, have the PS4 cursor on 'normal' speed and set my sens to .09. I would need my entire desk to do a 360, not to mention the in-game cursor to ready and move weapons around is SUPER slow. 

In theory they should be the same but I'm guessing they are not?

And somewhat my keybindings. 

My background is not mainly in shooters, so aim does not come naturally to me but I am not horrid at it. My dpi is 400, same dpi I ran when I played Overwatch. I run 0.08 sensitivity but I feel like going up would be good, but I'm unsure in how big of intervals or what I should just force myself to get used to. 

To my bindings, I run;
Walls: C
Floors: E
Stairs: Q
Roof: MB5
Trap: T
Edit: F. 

I love my edit key but pretty much everything else is subject to change and I just am unsure if this is the most optimal setup for building as fast as  I can

Chiller's utility is very similar to the Boogie Bomb. Its effect affects both ally and enemy but the only difference these both have right is range usage. 

Let's be honest, the way we have to use the Chiller is just limited. You just gonna hope for darn luck for an enemy to go step on it. And even if you wanna use it for mobility, to place it on a platform just takes away the flexibility. 

Imagine the possibility if the Chiller is a grenade. Better tactical usage and better mobility creativity. ",FortniteCompetitive

The obvious answer is if he has a double barrel keep distance. Okay but what if I didn't know he had one? The answer to that is assume he does, play as if he does. Okay then wtf am I supposed to do? Stay two squared away and spray his walls until he decides ""yeah I'll just stop painting these walls now and let him shoot me"". I can't figure out away to confirm a kill from a distance that isn't sit there and spray 300+ bullets until he runs out of mats. Virtually all build fights result in double barrel range combat.

While actually hitting my shots. It’s gotten to the point I relied on my gray AR up close when I had that trashy gray smg too. Was not taking the chance of me requiring almost my entire clip to kill a guy. I made the right decision casue I won. 

This smg needs to be vaulted imo. It’s at that point where I would rather shotgun AR then rely on that sorry excuse for a weapon. My vow is I would never use that piece of garbage weapon ever again. ",FortniteCompetitive

Since the past couple months, after certain updates several people say they feel their aim is significantly higher than usual on console.

The beginning of this sensitive on console crisis was the update lowering aim-assist for spamming ADS. This update helped counter ADS spam, but everyone’s sensitivities felt wayyy higher than before the update, including mine. Our ADS, Non-ADS, and Scoped sensitivities felt completely different, even with aim assist. After the first couple weeks I didn’t change my sensitivity, thinking Epic had a plan to fix this. Nothing happened. So I finally lowered my sense by a large amount.

And once again, after today’s update, I saw someone say their aim felt significantly off than before the update. Now I know for a fact this is not Placebo effect, because I know the difference between not playing after a couple days and THIS kind of sensitivity change. After a couple of days of not playing, my aim usually feels pretty off, but after like 5-10 min of playground I feel fine again.

It does not feel like that kind of change after yesterday’s update. At all. I got on with my friend who just finished the update, and I did not tell him about the sensitivity change, to see if he felt a change, so I could confirm it’s not Placebo. And literally right after 3 minutes of landing he says his ADS with AR sensitivity and his Scoped Sens (thermal/semi auto) felt much higher than usual.

This is terrible for console players. Epic has NEVER said a single thing about the sensitivity, except maybe one time in the beginning with the anti-ADS spam update. But that’s it. And there’s multiple times it’s done this. I’m fucking tired of these updates where I am forced to change my sensitivity constantly, never getting to find a comfortable place. Nothing in patch notes about it either.

I would like to imagine how PC pros would feel if they’re about to compete in million dollar skirmishes and right before the skirmishes begin Epic releases an unannounced sensitivity change that would kill the players’ performance.


I do applaud Epic for trying to help console with custom binds, listening to configuration feedback etc.. But this needs to be addressed more.  This is unnecessary.

If you use it like a normal spike trap, you’ll end up fucking both of you until one of you slides off the build and dies or something.

If you manage to only get them, they’ll just continue to turtle until the effects wear off



You can’t go uphill with it, but you can go downhill really fast. That’s too bad you’ll most likely end up going down a hill really fast and get stuck in a ditch for a minute not being able to move when you could’ve ran past there already if you just normally ran.

Also, it doesn’t negate fall damage so getting off a mountain really fast would change nothing besides you’ll gain more momentum and take more fall damage cause of it

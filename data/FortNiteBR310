I see everyone bashing Sony and getting angry at them but, unless I just missed it, no one getting angry at Epic?  

Surely they're to blame as much as you blame Sony, no? As people like to bring up on this topic, ""3rd party account. So why wasn't this 3rd party, Epic, upfront with people about what would happen if you link your PSN to your Epic account? You think there would be some sort of warning before hand, from both parties really.  

Epic clearly agreed to Sony's terms about this, so they allowed this to happen, they knew it'd happen. They were being sneaky. It was the same with the PSN Epic account on Xbox, so I'm surprised people didn't expect the same with the switch?

Also, to the people saying stuff like ""Stop holding my account hostage"", you really can't complain when you didn't read the ToS &amp; Privacy Policies, etc. They are legal binding documentation. (I'm just state a fact here, not attacking or defending anyone.)

(If it wasn't apparent I'm on neither side. Honestly, I don't care either way as it makes 0 difference to me. I'm neutral on the situation and just watching it unfold, but this question has intrigued me. Anyone that can, feel free to answer.)  

(Last thing, just in case, this isn't questioning the players attitude/actions as I can understand why you would want your content on another device. Even if I think it has been blown out of proportion.)",FortNiteBR

After reading a few posts on this subreddit I’ve realised I’m only half way towards level 80 and I find this very off putting. 

Basically I work 40 hours a week and have other commitments outside of gaming so my amount of time available to play games is limited, compared to say a 16 year old. I am 27 and have a disposable income but because the level 80 rewards are out of reach for me and probably others I’m less inclined to pay money for custom skins.

Meh aim, I only go for body shots 

I don’t know what to do when I get high ground/how to use it.

Bush camp. E/F 5/6 on the mountains with no loot on them...90% of the time you’re in the circle, 

If you want to maximize your gains it’s better to lose with 0 kills to the top 6 as opposed to getting 6 kills and dying before the first circle.

Make sure you’re doing it with squad fill turned on that way their kills will give you more EXP and there’s 3 people that’s 3 less that can kill you, and 3 more to take the hits for you — screw the team.

There’s a video out there with 75K that says bush camping doesn’t work, which is absolutely untrue i’m averaging 400-500exp per game while playing something else, watching a video going AFK.

of course you can try to get wins and maybe ??? Get 1000exp, but if you don’t want to play the game but need the levels this is your best bet.

Gonna get hate for telling the truth, but yall can play the game how you want and i’ll play it how i want, and this is the easiest way to level up your carbide/omega armor.",FortNiteBR

You can use it to scout ur enemies but it doesn't mean they have to camp in a box. Obviously you will be very vulnerable when using it to scout so that would balance it I think.

As someone who took COD very seriously I always played and about 4-5 sensitivity and if I played anything higher than 7 is just threw my shot off. And I’m having the same problem with fortnite. I play on 5X and 5Y but when it comes to building I’m just super slow at trying to seize high ground. I feel like everyone does it faster then me. So I think epic should add a building sensitivity and the regular X and Y sensitivity. This will make it so much easier for people who can’t play with high sensitivity while using weapons. Me personally I feel like I have great aim but I feel like it’s my perfect shot over not being able to build. Why not both?

TL;DR: Epic should add building sensitivity to help cater to those who don’t like using a high sensitivity for gun fights.

He says that no matter how good your aim is, you can still lose a gun fight because of bloom. This got me thinking and I agree and disagree. I agree because I, and I’m sure many of you have as well, have lost fun fights because it seemed that even though your reticle was on your opponent the entire time, you didn’t hit a single hit. I disagree because I feel like building helps to even out the playing field. If you are in a fight and missing all of your shots but he is hitting you, then you can build to try and reset the fight. Anyways, sorry for the long post but I’m curious about what your guy’s thoughts are about bloom in fortnite and if it should be removed or kept or maybe even if you have another system in mind!

Before, shotguns and building was how to win a fight . Now they have nerfed the mats in floor loot and llamas and nerfed the shotguns. I know you think that they just nerfed the headshot damage on two guns and normal damage on one but they also snuck one more thing into the game, they changed the range of shotguns by decreasing the space you can use for a headshot. It used to be head and neck now it's just head. Shotguns and building were the two things that separated good and bad players. Shotguns have no luck involved as a slow shooting non-spammable weapon. Good players always out build bad players. And they decreased the effectiveness of both building and shotguns. Two things that good players use as a skill gap. This game is turning into a luck based SMG and AR spam game where luck has such a factor that good players will lose to bad players just because of the bloom pointing in the right direction on their SMG",FortNiteBR

Back then, there wasn't really much of an incentive for grinding levels and it was more of a thing to show off.  However, now with the addition of the season 4 battle pass and the Omega and Carbide skins, you can unlock styles for both of these skins by leveling up.  I honestly loved this idea and was hyped about getting to 80 to get the lights for Omega; however, I was really discouraged by the fact that you need 532,250 XP to get reach level 80.  I'm not really that good of a player, probably average at best, but I do like collecting skins and other cosmetics.  Currently, I am level 68, and I am just so burnt out from ""grinding"" XP.  

Right now, the best way to ""grind"" XP, is to basically just win squad games with a team with 40% friend bonus.  On average, you can get around 1000-1600 XP a win with this group.  The amount of XP you get a win is just about trash considering how hard it is to get a win for an Average player.  The weekly and daily challenges are nice, but the amount of XP they give seriously needs to get buffed.  There's not really a point in doing them because the XP is just so low compared to just playing a regular game.  

I suggest that Epic Games, significantly increase the amount of XP you get for winning a game to make it more ""rewarding"" and to increase the amount of XP we get from challenges after hitting tier 100.  They should introduce more ways to get XP in games, such as XP based on the amount of damage you do, material gathered or even a win streak bonus.  The XP for eliminations should be buffed also. 

I like the idea about slowly upgrading your skins, but I don't really like the fact that I have only an X amount of days to finish the skin from the Battle Pass that I bought.  So Epic games, increase the XP given from games and challenges, have a double XP weekend, or allow people who've bought the season 4 battle pass and got to tier 100 the ability to unlock the styles after season 4.  Because honestly, I don't like playing this game all day every day.  ",FortNiteBR

I was watching Ninjas stream just now and got notice of the drama surrounding Team Secret´s recent tweet. Read up on it here: [https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR](https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR)

Now, I wanna give my opinion and thoughts on the topic and have a healthy discussion about it. I feel that things like these are really important as the Fortnite community is still being formed atm.

Ninja mentioned on stream that he thinks the tweet was extremely disrespectful and you should always stay humble and no one ever would want you not to be humble - I think that is wrong.

I feel like trying to spice things up is not a bad thing itself. The reason this tweet backfired imo is that the community is so diverse and no one really went into that direction yet. Messing it up can be really easy. However, what I extremely dislike is this overly friendly fake attitude - everyone going ""gg ur so gud jesus dont make me cream &lt;333333"" after their matches in the Fortnite Friday tournament. While this might be a cultural thing and some of you guys feel like it comes across as honest it surely does not for me. It simply feels like people are afraid to have their own opinion cuz they are afraid of overly popular streamers who influence such a huge part of the community - especially Ninja who draws such huge numbers.

I understand that this community draws many people from a younger audience, but not only. I wish people would not go as hard on this tweet, take a step back and actually ask themselves what they want this community to be like. Respect is utterly important and you do not want to mess up in a game where PR is so important at the moment - but people will mess up. That is life. Ninja immediately going like ""this guy should be fired"" because of this tweet is ridiculous in my opinion and it is important to mention how much influence people like him have. Earlier today he went like ""freaking..."" and it sounded like he said ""fucking.."" and he immediately felt like making that clear. That is just overly sensitive imo and it feels way too forced. This game is a god damn shooter and not Tetris.

Let me conclude this by saying that I really enjoy watching most streamers and most of my Twitch time is spent on Ninjas as I love his gameplay. Nonetheless, there were many moments were I had to disagree with him on certain topics and I feel like not everything needs to be sugarcoated - no too much at least.

Thanks for your time and share your opinions.",FortNiteBR

I play Fortnite a lot and I really wanna get better at the game, but it feels like I'm not whenever I do play. My legs literally shake in fear when I get into a build fight and so i end up dying. I notice my heart rate goes up a lot too. Youtube videos are always like ""stay calm stay calm blah blah blah"" but it doesn't work. My heart rate manages to go up anyways. I get so ANGRY at myself when my heart rate goes up because that means I didn't stay calm so I always get super mad at myself. At this point, I feel like I am not getting any good at fortnite to be honest. My TRN rating on Fortnite tracker has been going down, my K/D is stuck at 1.11, I was really good in May but I suck now in June. I don't know what to do guys. I'm hating myself because I can't be good like all of you guys. What do I do? I don't wanna hear ""just practice/just grind the game"" because that's what I've been doing for over a month and yet I feel like I'm not progressing at all in my skill.",FortNiteBR

Prove me wrong, change my mind.","For starters I do not use double pump and think it should be removed but shotgun damage should be reverted. my current inventory is two shotguns, sniper/splode, minis, medkits . I do not carry an AR because of the bloom aspect. I carry shotguns because they are guaranteed to do some damage if you aim(hitscan) and a sniper because you just have to compensate for elevation. 

When I go to shoot someone with an AR it goes something like this:

1. I shoot at them and none of my bullets hit because of rng and they spam walls and are ready to fight back

2. I shoot at them, hit them one time if I’m lucky for 20-30 damage, they build walls and are ready to fight back.

The small amount of damage you get from an AR isn’t worth it compared to waiting for a shotgun surprise attack.

I am a good player, I have over 500 wins, I can build extremely well and play overly aggressive because I am confident when I push a player shooting at me with an AR I know I won’t be hit or I’ll be hit mildly. If they hit me one of two things happens

1. They stop my push, I heal, then continue my push and dump on them with shotguns

2. They stop my push, rush me while I’m healing, and go exactly where I want them. Close range. I win again.

As an overly aggressive shotgun user, I would be discouraged to rush people and use my shotguns less if AR’s were more accurate and you could get consistent hits on me. Prove me wrong.",FortNiteBR

It’s one of those weapons I always try to make room for, just because I find it extremely fun to use. However, it isn’t that viable, at all. The weapon itself isn’t really easier to use or hit shots than a sniper rifle is, but does a considerable amount of less damage. 

**Let’s talk about early game:** Getting a Hunting Rifle through a chest can almost certainly be a death sentence. Both weapons do 200+ to the head, however, if you hit someone anywhere other than the head, the weapon is NOT a one shot kill. The Green rarity hits for 86 to the body, and the Blue hits for 90. You have to hit two shots for the kill. When you have no choice but to fight with the first weapon from the chest, the long reload time of the hunting rifle almost makes your death inevitable.

Let’s be honest. We’ve all said  “God damn it, I got a Hunting Rifle” at least once or twice this week. 

**Proposal:** Damage increase to help with early game. Hunting rifles should be a one shot kill to the body in the early game. Just like Traps early game was a problem, and needed to be buffed to 100. Green Hunting Rifle should be at least 100, Blue 105.

**Mid to Late Game:** It isn’t better than a Bolt Action/Semi Auto from afar. It isn’t better than a Shotgun or a Sub from close. It isn’t better than any AR from Mid-range. 

So where does the Hunting Rifle come in exactly? It’s only viability really is to see someone off guard, shoot at them for that initial burst damage advantage it has over an AR, then before the shot even hits or misses, quickly switch to your AR for the consistent damage. 

I don’t believe the weapon is that far off from where it needs to be. It just needs a small buff honestly. We don’t need this weapon to be super powerful, but it can use a little help.

I think an LTM that’s basically 50v50 where one person is chosen at random to be the president on each team and the rest of the players have to protect this one player/ Eliminate opposing president would be really fun. The “president would have increased health. Maybe be able to revive teammates faster than you normally can. Not sure haven’t worked out all the kinks.

It is not fair that although I put a lot of work and paid to get the finished product, I’m not going to get it because it’s too hard. Would be best if cap was lowered to level 70.

Do people seriously think it’s possible to reach level 80 when they’re at level 45? Level 62 is halfway and a decent non-win game usually gives 250xp. Let’s say you play with a maxed battle pass with a maxed squad. That’ll be a total of 240% Bonus, that’ll give you about 800+ do but game. You still probably require 200,000-400,000 (in my case at level 57, 300,000+) xp. That means that if I still require 400,000xp, I’ll need to have 500 decent games with a full squad.

However, most of our battle passes are not maxed, and most of us probably have lives to live. So with only 20 days left, 500 twenty minute games is about 170 hours of playtime.

The challenges that give xp saves us only a few games and barely puts a dent into the grind since there are very few challenges that give a lot. (I mean, dailies only give an equivalent to a game)

‘Not everyone should get the skin by doing nothing, they should work hard to get it.’

Does hard work equal to me spending my whole day playing a game? Maybe, but playing a game isn’t the only thing I can do all day. 

Okay, I’m currently at Tier 87 at level 57. Is it possible for me to reach level 80 if I buy the rest of the tiers now? No, it’ll make the grind less but I doubt I’d make it.

‘Epic made it like this to prevent people to outright buying the final product.’

True, but if they bought the 100 tiers at the start of the season, they’d have an easier time with less grind. If I bought 100 tiers at the start, I would’ve already reached level 80 as well.

‘What makes you so justified to get the full product.’

Well I paid expecting to get the full product, I didn’t buy something expecting to get an unfinished product. Not only that, it’s advertised that I’d get everything in less than a hundred hours but it’ll clearly take 5 times of that to reach level 80.

If I’m being honest, it’s discouraging trying to reach level 80 while also being sure that I’m not going to make it. The only thing that could change this is not an double xp event but just lowering the level needed to level 70.",FortNiteBR

If you have sufficient rockets, your enemy is screwed because you can't outbuild 6 grenades coming at you in a span of 6 seconds. They bounce around and can easily get over walls, under walls (if you're on a hill), and their damage radius is pretty spectacular. 

They're quiet compared to RPGs as well. You can hear an RPG coming at you for the entirety of its flight as well as the initial sound of it being fired. With grenade launchers, you hear the initial *thwoomp* but after that, no mid-air flight sounds, only a bounce, if you're lucky. 

Late game in squads is where it's the worst though. There you have a good chance of encountering a squad with more than one, and with a good stash of rockets. If you don't have a launch pad, there's literally NOTHING to counter a barrage of grenades. At least with RPGs, they fire only one, the trajectory of the rocket is straight, and it takes more than 1 second to reload. But grenade launchers are a different beast. They really should be nerfed.

It's clear that Ninja is Fortnites poster child, they gave him a lot of attention and just hyped him up overall as he is a big face in the community and the biggest streamer, this was clear when they went to his pov and the commentators instantly shouted ""NINJAS POV ITS NINJAS POV GUYS"" as well as just showing him a lot in comparison to the over 99 players (myth also got a lot of air) this makes sense and theres nothing wrong with this.

Epic games would want Ninja to win as it creates hype which of course is what they want, especially as this is there first esports tournament. It also proves the game takes skill as it wouldnt look good if he loses to some randoms that no one knows in comparison to someone who grinds all day every day

Now onto evidence to back me up.

My PSN account pays for PS Plus with family sharing working to allow his PSN account to work properly online as well(without paying for PS Plus on his account). I decided today to get us the Battle Pass since we play so much, and got it on my account since my account handles all purchases (my account is activated as the primary user on his system, so everything I’ve bought, and will buy, he can use for free, but if he were to buy something on his account, I wouldn’t be able to use it on that system). So, like every other purchase I’ve made on this PlayStation and on my account, I expected this to work, but apparently it doesn’t.

The Battlepass works fine on my PSN account, the account I used to purchase it. But, anytime I try to switch to my father’s account, it goes away. This is the first thing I’ve purchased on PS4 that doesn’t allow multiple accounts to share in the purchase. I came on here to ask if anyone else is having this problem, but I’m starting to believe that this is intentional by Epic Games in order to make sure every possible account is paying money for their DLC, which is kind of disappointing since I just wanted to give us some skins to play with on the game. I saw in some places that by using an Epic Games account you might be able to do it, but I’m trying to avoid that since linking an Epic Games account to a PS4 essentially prohibits it from working on any other console. So right now I’m just wondering if there’s any other possible way to share purchases. Thanks.",FortNiteBR

Some streamers like Tfue or Ninja frequently use the axe, now those people who called me out are saying they regret not buying the axe. This has caused me to lose some brain cells.

However, I notice that when building, the game requires you to press whatever key you have set to wall/ramp/etc &amp; then press another key (the fire key aka left mouse click). 

I feel like this requires more finger movement than necessary because it forces you to press 2 different buttons. On a controller however, using Builder Pro, you only need to press the button for wall/ramp/etc &amp; then quickly press it again to trigger the build. While both methods require 2 clicks, its much faster/simpler to simply press the button for wall/ramp/etc twice quickly.

This comes especially in handy when building under fire. Under that pressure, it helps to be able to simply double tap whatever you want to build, rather than doing wall, trigger, ramp, trigger, floor, trigger. 

As far as I know, there is no way to alter this in settings. It would be great to have the option to simply double tap whatever we like built.

I have an admittedly crazy idea to improve the game, but hear me out please ... have more than 25 people survive until the first circle.

The middle game has become boring as hell lately with most people dying so fast. I thought as time went on more people would reach the endgame, but recently it's gotten way worse. 

So could 4/5 people stop dying in 5 minutes ... so we can kill you at later points in the game instead?

Thanks. 

If this proves impossible, they should cut the storm times in the midgame by about 10-20 seconds to improve things IMO.

I bought it and I even found it out it offers different sounds when swinging and pulling out of your backpack, which is also kinda cool compared to some other 800 v-bucks pickaxes which doesn't' have any custom sounds.

The only thing that irritates me personally is the ball on it, it kinda irritates when you swing your pickaxe and causes some of your vision to get blocked, however I think it's something you can get used to and there's also many more pickaxes which block view than this one.

However I am not sure yet if I would refund it after a while due to me getting bored of it. I am tier 91 and I am very close to the Omega skin and his pickaxe is also quite good looking. Adding to that I'll definitely be rocking the omega skin for a long while due to how awesome is that and might want the pickaxe of it just to have the 'complete set'. I am afraid I might be ditching the Elite Cleat due to that.

I know we've been discussing this when the skin was leaked, but i want to bring it back now since it's officialy released. so as you all know, the soccer skin was designed to match the football world  cup, considered the most important sport event. And as you've surely noticied we are able to customize jerseys color depending on country, several countries qualified for the world cup were represented, i'm a big football fan, and a huge fortnite lover, i was so hyped by this skin, untill i find out that my country (morocco, who is also qualified for the world cup) isn't represented, all my hype turned into disappointement, and I still don't understand why some countries were left out, ( such us  Costa Rica, Croatia, Iran, Morocco, Panama, Peru, Senegal, Serbia and Tunisia) can you guys just explain to me (or may be Epic themselves if this post get upvoted enough) why this countries doesn't deserve a skin customization ? on what criteria are we excluded ? i aren't we purchasing enough skin ? this is not true at all because i know moroccans do,  Epic needs to understand that moroccan player involve not only moroccans living in morocco but all moroccans living around the world including france or in the united states, i've tried to talk to the online support about the matter, but as you can see [here](https://postimg.cc/image/ln5k8tqgd/), a bot couldn't have given me worst as an answer.

 Please before you answer, or downvote me, try to feel us, and don't tell me it doesn't matter it's just "" a skin"" because it does matter.

Less viewers on Twitch, streamers are getting bored, now. Fortnite is going to keep going down this path if it does not add consistent game mechanics and less RNG.

Shotguns should be more consistent (no 9 damage shotgun, should do at LEAST more than 50 even if not all bullets hit). I'm not necessarily saying BUFF shotguns, I just want them consistent

AR BLOOM SHOULD BE 100% REMOVED. NO OTHER GAME HAS BLOOM. IT IS THE DUMBEST MECHANIC, IT TAKES AWAY FROM SKILL AND ADDS RNG. It shouldn't be mandatory to rely on first-shot bonus to hit your target.

EPIC needs to stop trying to nerf the build meta (dropping llamas down to 200 mats, dropping floor drops from 30 to 20 mats). This game is centralized around building, and currently stands as the only fair, skill gap aspect of this game.

Felt great but that was 600 games ago.

I adjusted my sensitivity, began moving around a lot more to have a better stock of mats for the endgame, used to get &lt;1 kill a game and now I get 3-4 on average (best game was 9), but I still can’t win. 

My strategy is usually land at the hotel near anarchy, make my way toward the center of the circle, run around while trying to loot, if I’m happy with my loadout then I find a place to hide while there’s ~20 people left, wait until there’s about 5 (or until absolutely necessary to move), and then react to the game around me (letting people wipe each other out and then surprising them, usually). 

And I CANNOT WIN. Like I said, I’m capable of getting kills and am passable at build battles (I’ve started carrying C4 so I can blow up the tower when a build battle gets too ridiculous), but for some reason small stuff seems to stop me.

I want to keep playing because for some reason I’ve really fallen for this game but the fact that I have no friends that play and have won only once in the two seasons I’ve played it is very discouraging. Advice would be appreciated.

Even though this post is going to be taken down for ""not being suitable for the subreddit"", it really needs to be reiterated that the current state of the game is catering to new and casual players rather than those who want to win.

When I first started playing Fortnite, I could play hours on-end. Nowadays, I struggle to spend 30 minutes of ""that shot missed"" or ""hey! here's seven damage"" or even playing organised games with my friends. Initially, Fortnite was a game that didn't give a reason for people to rage quit. Everything was quite well balanced and people weren't generally bothered about getting 9 damage hits - because it rarely happened. Nowadays, they're nerfing the shotgun to a point where actual decent players who know how to aim can't get a one-shot kill. They're forcing people to accept the fact that they'd probably be better off not getting into fights. They're catering to slow-paced ""noobs"" that have infiltrated the game at a late time, just to keep them coming back in order to buy V-Bucks.

It's no secret that Epic Games have terrible customer support. If anything, I'd actually be surprised if they even had a team dedicated to their position in that sense. Atop of this, it's almost like they don't want people to play their game anymore. **I'm almost certain that this game will be dead before it's out of beta.** They'd have killed off all of their dedicated fanbase, whomst of which have put thousands of hours into the game, and be left with incompetent no-skins that don't even spend money on the game - isn't that what they want?

I really dislike writing, but at this stage almost anything is better than playing a game that lost its purpose.

(Thanks for removing this. I'll be sure to email Epic's support with this exact post pasted in my ""issue"" section.)",FortNiteBR

The Alpine Ace and Mogul Master skins came out when the Winter Olympics were going on, and 8 Alpine Ace and 8 Mogul Master skins came out. Each of them were 1,500 V-Bucks. The soccer skins came out today, each of them being 1,200 V-Bucks and there were 4 guys and 4 girl variants. Each soccer skin comes with 28 different countries that you get to choose from simply by buying one of those skins. Now, the Alpine Ace and Mogul Master skins cost 1,500 each, and the new soccer skins cost 1,200 each, but the Alpine Ace and Mogul master only come with one country per skin, while the soccer skins have 28 countries per skin. So, Epic, why not add the option for those of us who bought the Skii skin to be able to choose from all 8 countries? This would benefit all of those who bought those skins, and as I imagine they will probably not come out with these skins again, (I could be wrong), it shouldn’t hurt them financially. Also, it wouldn’t be impossible for them to add an “Edit Style” option on a skin that existed before that option came out, seeing that Carbide and Omega existed before it and have the ability to change style. This is just a suggestion, not whining or anything, and I would understand if they didn’t do this. However, I would love to see it come to the game. 

TL;DR: Add edit style option for all countries to the Alpine Ace and Mogul Master skins",FortNiteBR

Once thats over all the big streamers and their fans will all dessert this game. Its not even because of crappy updates imo. I find the game just too hard to play and Im not even a shitty player (400+ wins, 13k kills). Everyone has accumulated insane building, precise aim and overpowering skill. New players cant even have fun despite there being playground and creative. We've come to the point where theres no where to hide, the circle is no longer a threat (unless you can play scrims) and bases are pointless. Basically if you cant one pump and edit builds, you'll never win. Its insanely difficult and theres no more fun in this anymore. Even the tourney-level have to work together. Even solos have become a fuckfest of 3rd partying god builders. The battle passes give even less freedom as they basically tell you how you should play the game.

There is absolutely no update fortnite can release to fix this mess. Fortnite has just become a pile of shit.",FortNiteBR

6,VincentVanFagoat,1559122642,bucji5,34,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bucji5/the_eye_is_no_dragon_theory/,82,The Eye is no dragon. [Theory],"I've been waning interest in the game and when I heard about an eye showing up at polar peak, I was first dismissive and didn't care what it was. However, when I saw it for myself, I came to an interesting speculation


Many speculate that the eye is that of a dragon. However, I believe it's something much worse. Firstly, I want to mention the event occuring in the other mode is called ""A Blast from the Past"" which is based around the dinosaurs. Basically the event goes like this: Lok, a robot, is stranded and comes across a great horror that he can't describe.


Something I want to point out, is that the eye, isn't the type of eye a reptile would have. Most reptiles have eyes with slit pupils. Dragons, normally being based of reptiles, usually have these kind of eyes. However, the eye at polar peak has a circular pupil, much like a human.


What this leads me to believe, is the being that's trapped at polar peak, is not a dragon. But rather, an lovecraftian horror or an Elder God. You see, one of the things that is common about lovecraftian horrors, is they often can't be described. Lok who witnessed the horror, is incapable of describing the horror he saw and is in constant need of distraction to avoid thinking about what he witnessed. 


Why an Elder God and what would they do? Well, it's entirely possible, given the other mode's event title ""A Blast From the Past"" that we may see the island reset or destroyed in someway. The constant meddling of the island has awaken the horror beneath polar peak. First, a desert is rifted in. Then a galcier terraforming part of the island. A massive volcano erupts from the ground and destroys chunks of the map, and now parts of island has advanced into a neo city landscape. 


With the constant changes occurring on the island, I believe it's awoken an ancient one from their slumber, and soon, once they are free, will wreak unleash their rage or use some form of eldtrich power to turn the island into a blank slate, possibly even resetting it. A true ""Blast from the Past.""",FortNiteBR

But I've been playing Fortnite for almost 2 years now and I'm just starting to get really upset with the way the game is evolving, I do not think the current path is healthy for the game's longevity or the community as a whole. I do not want Fortnite to die, I want the game to be around for as long as it can be, I want you all to know that everything I'm going to say here is from love for the game, I love Fortnite so much that's why this is a bit long winded, but i feel like some changes NEED to be made immediately to the game and to Epic's general vision of how the game should work so please bear with me and leave constructive comments. Let me know how you feel about anything I've said here.

&amp;#x200B;

# Basically

I feel like Epic's vision of Battle Royale is a bit out of touch. I have a few suggestions for a (hopefully) more simple, intuitive and fun Fortnite experience for all players.

&amp;#x200B;

# Item Related Changes

* Late game there are no shield potions going around. We can only carry 6 now, by the time you've killed a player late game they've already drank all of the potions leaving you injured with no way to heal because there weren't enough potions brought to endgame.
* The boom bow needs to go. You already know why. There's no counter play to being surprise splashed for 100 damage by an enemy you didn't even know was there and couldn't do anything to prevent them even if you knew. It's just so OP i dropped a 15 kill game with that alone. You can really just pull up on a player and use the boom bow as a shotgun if you aim is good enough. And why does it travel 300+ meters in a nanosecond but a sniper shot takes a decade to travel the map? That makes 0 sense. At least make it only appear in drops.
* Remove tac shotgun, in the current meta it's useless and the removal of the tac would give more space for combat shotguns to spawn.
* Remove all handguns. It's not even cool for a player to land somewhere, not get a chest spawn, then get a single gray handgun as floor loot, then expect to go up against a player with anything else in the loot pool, you stand no chance with a handgun unless the player your fighting is a bot, removing handguns will give room for other more useful weapons to spawn.
* Remove the Heavy Assault rifle. Its clearly the inferior rifle and at close range your getting killed by anything except maybe a heavy sniper, waste of space, take it out.
* Snipers need to be reworked and adjusted or removed. I'm not sure what happened, but recently there's been an over-abundance of sniper usage, for the last few months every single player i come across has some form of sniper which leads me into 2 issues. The long range 3rd parties from snipers is getting way out of hand, you can't even fight anymore because and entire team of snipers will be on your head before the first shot is fired. The other issue is the heavy sniper, we need to reduce the number of these somehow because my god, everyone has one and they don't even snipe with it, they just use it as a surprise breach charge and bum rush straight into your box. Its actually getting insane the amount of players doing this. (Why did this suddenly become popular? Its been a known thing since the heavy was put into the game)
* Explosives quite simply need to be removed. They are such an overpowered tool in the right hands it's no contest, once a crazy good player picks up one of these he's guaranteed the game and even bad players instantly become insanely dangerous with one. I feel rockets are unnecessary to the game, guns spray builds up just fine enough and if rockets are intended for build destruction, maybe severely nerf the player damage? Maybe even inflict double damage if a player hits themselves with an explosive to deter kamikaze bots from shooting the ground. I just feel like 150 from a weapon that destroys an entire 1by1 in one blast is a bit harsh. Either remove it or make it blue so everyone has a chance to get it to even it out i say.
* Stink bombs need a heavy nerf. The way a stink bomb should work is if you are inside the gas cloud for more than a certain amount of time (shown by a stink meter) you begin to take damage, a player should not be able to just surprise stink you out of your position with no counterplay.

# Gameplay Related Changes

* We DEFINITELY need a buff to the material farming rate. NOBODY likes farming. Not a single person. It shouldn't even be a major part of the game, running out of mats should not be 80% of fights if you spent 20 minutes farming. If little Timmy farms for 30 minutes, gets all maxed out just to die, you can believe he's never farming again. But if farming wasn't a 9 to 5 job he would be more willing to farm again next game.
* Chests should spawn 100% of the time. I'm not sure why they don't but that doesn't add excitement to the game, it just pisses you off when you die to a 10 year old because he got a gun and you didn't.
* Like I said above, right now opening chests yields more disappointments than reward, if opening a chest was more rewarding most times it would really increase enjoyment of each round.
* Glider redeploy needs to be fixed asap. Idk why you guys made it where the glider disables your ability to dive after being auto deployed but that's nonsense, give us back our free diving mechanic please, make gliding feel good again.
* When jumping out the bus, auto deploy should be a lot lower to the ground so we can get to the action faster, this is a battle royale, not a glider sim, tbh we should just be able to forgo deploying our glider and just hit the ground and get to work.
* Redeploy should be built-in to our characters. We should not have to use a precious item slot just to get mobility, there are areas of the map where if the storm goes the opposite way and you get unlucky enough for 0 mobility items to spawn (quads, rifts, launchpads, gliders...nothing) and no heals you are guaranteed to die in the storm. The issue is magnified when players don't care about rotating to the next circle and fight you in the storm, currently, without pads or shadow bombs there is no way to escape combat with another player, you simply lack the mobility, you have to eliminate them before you can move on. In season 9 no player should be condemned to die in the storm due to broken game mechanics. Give us redeploy, and not the busted version, let us dive. Also, with the rise of third parties redeploy would allow us to get out of combat, how it is now if a player gets on you, someone has to die and that isn't how it should be, escape should be an option.
* I know I'm gonna get backlash for this but Siphon was such a good move for the game I can't fathom why you guys took it out. You say it supported ""unhealthy aggression"" and ""players at large were frustrated with it"" but I don't see what you mean. Ever since the removal of siphon players have been so much more aggressive, i've been getting dropped off by players with like 10 kills, then watching him get killed by a player with 13 kills, so that aggression thing is nonsense. And secondly, ""players at large were getting frustrated"" makes 0 sense. In the current siphon-less playstyle, if little timmy fights a sweat and wins, he's at 10hp because a good players is always going to make a dent in you no matter what. But if siphon was on he'd be at 60, I don't see why that would be frustrating for him at all. Now late game, if little timmy shoots at a guy, then realizes the guy is at full health and gets bodied, that's tough for him, you cannot blame siphon for that, sometimes your enemies are at full health, its like that sometimes, if little timmy keeps his health up and maybe gets some kills, he could be at fully health just like his opponent. In a game like Fortnite where so many players are afraid to take their own fights so they just wait and third party, its third parties back to back and if you kill these players you should be rewarded so you can go into your next fight and gieeeeeeeeee them a good fight, it's that simple, you should not be forced to engage and enemy then get hurt, win the fight but still lose because you are weak and stand no chance in your next battle, thats nonsense.
* Another controversial point but i think it's time to put the edits back to clear instead of opaque. The opaque thing makes it where the enemy player has more advantage on your build than you do. While editing you have like 5% visibility through your own wall, but enemies can see you clearly. Then, when you are holding an edit and your wall takes damage you can't tell because you can't see the enemy and there is no build damage indicator while in edit mode. I think at this point we can make the edit squares clear again, it looks way cleaner and its more balanced for the owner of the build, if you're in front of their build they should have advantage.
* Consider giving players a shotgun (possible use for vaulted tac) off spawn. They jump off the bus with it in their inventory. That way players would think twice about just rushing defenseless players the second they get a weapon. You'd have to slow your roll.

# Quality of life

* I think Epic should implement a ""drag and release to confirm edit feature"" i feel like this would just streamline the editing process, lessening the amount of repeated keystrokes needed to do basic edits, it's a logical step forward for editing.
* Edit shortcuts. (i.e. if you click a corner and let go it'll automatically make a corner edit on that corner)
* If at all possible, client side building would be great, i don't really know much about how that would work, but if at all possible that would rock, no more getting our walls unfairly taken and replaced.
* Possibly implement some type of intentional wall replace mechanic?
* Traps only affect the sides of the box it was placed on. (You can crouch under roof traps, wall traps affect that 50% of the box that its on.)

Thats it I think. Again, I just want the game to be the best it can be and right now all i do is get pissed off at the nonsense that goes on in every game. I'm sure I'm not the only one out there, it really makes me miss season 3 when the game wasn't so crazy.",FortNiteBR

Before I get into my rant, then my suggestion, I hafta say what I mean by ""Back Seat Gaming"", is the type of person who is constantly barking in your ear telling you where to go and what to do. Like *telling you* what to do. Not to get confused with trying to be helpful, like saying ""a medkit was up those stairs behind you, some minis were on the bottom floor where I died"" or anything that isn't ""go here, go there, get my card, now run to point X to reboot me, get that purple gun in the storm, now you may as well just give me the controller because I am a god  even though you have more kills and I am dead....""

Anyway I can't stand it when I have a kid awake way past midnight chugging Redbull or Monster or Soda or heavily liquidized Rabies foam or whatever keeps them awake past their bedtime, just yelling in my ear telling me what to do while itsa 1v2 in squads and Im just trying to survive the encounter *at least*.

Like, Sit down kid Im alive with 4 elims and youre dead.  How can I hear footsteps or build or heck, even my own thoughts when you can't shut up and let me focus? Its hard enough keeping focus when I have impatience, a short temper and ADD. 

(Literally had a kid just a coupla minute ago, awake, like Go to bed dumb kid, you have school in the morning).

Same issue last night, was playing with a guy who was a bit condescending and acted like some kind of commander. He was a cop so, make of it what you will, but he was getting so annoying too. Just telling me what to do. Loudly commanding basically what I put in my Disclamer paragraph.

Last night It was getting so bad I had to mute him every time he died and I was still alive. Happened maybe 4 times. I had even started to get good at it. 

But I shouldn't have to do that! Bottom line, its bull crap I have to mute someone loud and obnoxious when Im in the middle of a freaking 1v2. My mind is alreafy racing, just shut up and let me pop a cap and win the clash. Can't do that when I can't focus.

TL;DR////////////////////

*Back seat gamers, the ones who are constantly telling you what to do, (not the ones who let you know where some bandos and minis are) yellimg in your ear, and ruining your focus, should be dealt with in a borderline passive aggressive yet effective way. Solution/suggestion.*

My suggestion is to have a 3rd option to mute or unmute people. You know the mute slider on players in your party? The one where you scroll to their name and press A/X (console), or left click on pc? My suggestion is to add this option 3 to the mute/unmute slider. It should go:

""unmuted-&gt;muted-&gt;muted if they die"".

This game consists of barely 2 shotguns, one being the tactical shotgun if you even can consider that gun a shotgun in itself, and then the combat shot gun which I rarely get to use. I never pick the tactical shotgun anymore due to its inconsistent damage. So now that puts the shotgun class in the second lowest gun category, ahead of Machine guns (Minigun).   


Now I'm not sure if Epic even watches Fortnite Competitive, but I'm pretty sure I can say for everyone it is not long range fighting. Maybe a smidge of Medium Range. But that is it. It is mostly all short range fighting... So why in the world is there double the amount of snipers in the game then shotguns? And one of the shotguns is a Blue-Gold rarity so you barely even see it.  (If someone could link me to a website that shows the droprates of everything in chests/llamas/supplydrops, that would be awesome :D) This is the equivalent is if PUBG got rid of the M16,M416,SCAR, and then added more SMGs and a Burst AR. Like how would that make any sense. But somehow it makes sense to Epic.  


I've invested hundreds if not thousands of hours into Fortnite, and it's insanely frustrating how they continue to push the competitive scene away and away. The only thing keeping me playing is to win money in Duos with my friend. But even he doesn't want to play this shit game anymore.   


This game is a joke now. Look at the LTMs the past few days... Classic and Solid Gold. The drop rates on the Pump and Combat shotgun aren't even in the 1 percent it feels like. The only times I would get a shotgun is by killing people when the game is almost over with. Does Epic hate shotguns?   


Epic continues to let down the competitive players every single patch, and honestly I have never seen a company mishandle a game so poorly in my life. Like are casual players even enjoying this game anymore? Is anyone? Lol.

  
Sorry for my long rant...I'm just left with questions and more questions from every patch. And it seems a lot of people I have talked with casuals/competitive players, they hate the game too.  


Cheers if you read the whole thing.  


TL;DR - Basically I'm sick of these constant patches that are ruining the game and competitive scene in Fortnite

Autofire is to OP with some guns such as pistols and combat shotguns. People just stand still let the game do all the aiming shooting.

So I‚Äôm not sure where the hell the whole Fortnite X Godzilla thing came from since the movie comes out in a year. 

Anyways, the giant eye appeared hours after the leviathan was released back into the shop after months of not being rotated in. My theory is that the leviathan LTM that was once joked about is may become an actual LTM.

The live event might have something to do with polar peak breaking completely, unveiling the ‚Äúleviathan‚Äù

While the spray meta can be annoying because all someone has to do is start lift clicking and w keying, one shot shotguns are not good for the game in regards of longevity. 

While i dont think many people would say the pump wasnt a balanced gun, it makes any other shotgun almost useless. We have had 5 different shotguns in the game since it came out, and anytime the pump was a one shot machine, the majority of players refused to pick up anything other then a pump, because the common mentality is ""if it doesnt one pump, I dont want it."" 

With this mentality it doesnt allow other shotguns to thrive, and makes it where making new shotguns is pointless for epic. When one weapon dominates an entire category of weapons,so much so that there is no point to any other guns, you know there is a problem, that is not balance. 

Just wanted to throw my two cents out there, this thread was sparked by seeing some comments on the top pinned thread talking about making the heavy a one shot weapon. Tell me what you think.",FortNiteBR

I think it is time to revisit this. It's been 5 seasons or so since we could do this. I think many of this would like this feature. At the very least, let mixed input teams match with other mixed input teams.

So what say you PC players? Are you really offended by joining a team with one console player? Even if you fill right now, theres a strong chance you'll get teamed up with a console or switch player or two. Why not let a team of 2 or 3, who likely work well together team up with you?",FortNiteBR

Make the damage 140/147 so you aren't stupidly 1-tapped at center mass because rngesus decided you might as well go f yourself. At least with the suppressed sniper it just wipes your shield, so you can get that back and survive. A sniper should reward clean aim at the head, and should not reward lil timmy and his joycons for being able to painstakingly figure out the aim button and fire at center mass.

The game has never been more RNG based than right now. Theres tons of bugs and things that dont work. The sound issues alone make this game not able to be played competitively. The path Epic Games is going is to make as much money as they can and thats totally fine but this path will never be arrangeable with a competitve game. Its so disrepectful towards the competitive player base to go both these pathes at the same time. Its like making a soccer worldcup on a mine field that changes its rules weekly. They should decide if they want an actual competitve game for the world cup and make a little less money during that time or if they want to milk this game to the bone and make a worldcup thats gonna be a joke.,FortNiteBR

tac shotty idk if its just me but that thing jams all the time, timing when it shoots seems inconsistent 

idk just my opinion

remove auto sniper and fucking stick up for your HARDCORE community Epic

Fortnite used to be simple and fun and now it is full of new POI that sucks. The snow biome is awful, no one lands there and it's really big and boring. The sand biome is cool, but there are only 2 good spots and few people land there as well as the jungle biome. Now that tilted and retail row are different only original 'towns' are fatal fields, salty and pleasant. 

I mean, we can no longer go to greasy, tomato town, risky, moisty, anarchy, wailing woods.. Those where really cool spots and would be awesome to play on the again.

Fortnite needs a new whole map and apart from that the original map from season 3. In my opinion, having at least these 2 maps would be amazing. 

Talking about the meta, it sucks. It's really hard to get the combat shotgun and the fact that it is the best shotgun says a lot about the shotguns on this game.  Besides, they unvaulted the most op and annoying gun (drum) and vaulted the pump shotgun, the only gun that could counter it.

251,beaushinkle,1559051791,bu0btg,90,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bu0btg/suggestion_make_stealing_walls_consistent_by/,396,[Suggestion] Make stealing walls consistent by adding a special swing to the pickaxe.,"Right now, skilled and low-ping players are able to surprise other skilled players by stealing walls through other's turbo build. See the first couple minutes of [Clix's World Cup qual video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTUZTZv3wgc).

In my opinion, the game would be better if you either *always* could steal someone's wall who is turbo building or if you could *never* steal someone's wall who is turbo building. Consistency here is key.

I propose the following change. If you're pickaxing a wall normally, and an opponent is turbo building that wall, the turbo building player always gets the replace. This is how the game currently operates for a huge percentage of the population.

Then, add an alt-fire to the pickaxe (same button as aim-down-the-sights) that gives it a longer windup. From testing, there's ~150ms between when you press swing and when it damages a wall. The longer windup could be ~250-350ms, and look like a big baseball swing or overhead chop or something equally cool (with it's own sound effect to warn the opponent), and when it connects with the build (if it destroys it), it immediately replaces the build with one of your own, provided you have the mats to do so. 

This would enable aggressive players to break into turtles in high-level (World Cup) matches without requiring that they were lucky enough to find an anti-turtle item, giving a fast defender time to block off the lost wall and edit out to a new safe place, while also creating a dynamic fight. The aggressor is vulnerable while they're swinging, and the defender can edit into them and get shots off, or the aggressor could start the swing and then cancel it to bait that play, etc.",FortNiteBR

Basically if you're a founder in the pve version then you could get a whole new tab on the battle pass. Kinda like a free pass for people who own the pve version. It could have one skin at whatever tier (maybe 10, 50, 100?) and that skin is a new mythic hero in the other version. I feel like it would kinda bridge the 2 games together and make people who own br wanna get the other version. The wraps, emoticons, loading screens could all be pve themed but used in br. Like husks faces on a wrap (like the fish one) or a loading screen of Lars Van. Maybe a skin of Dennis? I dunno I feel like people who spent money on a paid version of the game should get rewarded more than free to play users. The Founders pass could just be a single set of unlockables in one battle pass that you need to be a founder to unlock. Since pve version is gonna be free later this year (supposedly) then I feel like epic should give more incentives to buy it. They dont even advertise the game. Just an idea I'm hoping this gets passed along to the right people. ü•∞üòä",FortNiteBR

1) you kill somebody, their loot is yours, unless you say otherwise, especially at the beginning of a match
2) split mats and ammo when needed, dont be that one guy with max mats (same guy who steals your loot after a kill) while everyone else is sitting over here with 300
3) if its possible, prioritize teammates and reboot cards over loot, also stick with your teammates

We tried to establish these rules, but nowadays heres literally every fuckin squads/duo game:


Beginning of duo game:
Me: kills a guy
Teammate: MY LOOT NOW
me *but i need loot, i only have a gray pistol*
Teammate I nEeD lOoT tOo *has a gold shotgun*
me: *but i fucking killed him and only have a pistol*

Later after a fight
me: yo can i get some mats i got none left after that, these guys spammed with 2 drummies and an rpg
Teammate: (has 2k mats, again steals the loot) no, i need these, go farm
me: gets into a fight 2 fuckin seconds later, dies as i have no mats
Teammate: HOW TF DID YOU DIE THESE GUYS ARE ASS
me: *I had no fucking mats, and you didn't do shit to help*
also me: at least get my reboot card
Teammate: no I need the loot, besides, circle is coming in 
me: (looks at map) tf u mean you have a full minute and a half, you have max mats, and gold weapons get the fuckin card dipshit
Teammate: too late its gone now

Near the end of match
Teammate: oh fuck theres an actual god left oh shit why did u die bro
*loses game*
IF ONLY YOU DIDNT FUCKIN DIE BRO WHAT THE HELL WE COULDVE WON THAT

It‚Äôs not fun never being able to find guns that actually do anything or get stuck with a pistol while other dude has a shotgun and shields. I‚Äôm so beyond sick of the way looting really effects every little aspect of what otherwise would be a fun game. 

Like c‚Äômon man the BR landscape is old news now. Looting isn‚Äôt fun to anyone and yours used to be one of the best and is now the most RNG based out of all of them. Like why do y‚Äôall want your game to be so heavily RNG focused? That isn‚Äôt beneficial to anyone, not even bots. 

I really hope one day we get Fortnite as an arena shooter cuz the rng has just killed all fun in this game.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get downvoted but dude I want to fucking grind this game again, but I have no motivation when I play 5 games on a row and land on a grey tac, grey pistols, or bandages. ‚ÄúOh everyone has unlucky drops once in awhile‚Äù yeah that‚Äôs true but it‚Äôs never been this consistently bad.

Lets rewind the clock a little. Lets jump in a time machine if you will. To around season 4. Everything was tops. The gameplay was great the skins were great. Everyone was happy. The stars were aligned and Epic could do no wrong. What could go wrong?

And then they fucked it up. They added too much mobility with rifts in season 5 and glider redeploy in season 6 and kicked the game into overdrive. Players zoom around the map like they're Superman and Supergirl. I mean Jesus fuck lolz! What were they thinking?

Oh and remember that pump shotgun everyone liked? It's gone. The dumbasses lol no wait, the geniuses that's what they are, the geniuses over at Epic thought changing the shotgun was a good idea. When they finally got it right with the gold pump.

But i can live with that, hey nobodies perfect, and they're trying new things. As long as I have my 50v50 mode to play, I'll be alright. It is my favorite mode after all.

That's what I call it. Gotta have it though. Gotta have it. Or else the little kiddies would riot. How else would they get challenges done? The little scamps.

5: Mobility would be limited severely no vehicles, slipstreams, rifts, geysers, or cannons. Glider redeploy would be removed except for certain LTMs. 

6: End game circles wouldn't shift anymore and would go back to how they used to work. Shrinking consistently at each stage.

We all want EPIC to actually cycle the item shop. Lately, it feels as if the same 2-8 skins (you know the ones,) are always in the shop, and it is rather annoying to have ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS BACK!‚Äù skins like Leviathan today.

While most of the people on this subreddit don‚Äôt appreciate skin rarity, you must admit: a lot of people do. I myself while not an ‚ÄúOG STYLE!‚Äù myself necessarily, understand the feeling of loss when a skin you previously had is swarming the lobby. 

If EPIC were to agree that whenever an item shop skin is gone for 100+ Days it would get an ‚ÄúOG Style‚Äù that would 

A.) Encourage shop rotation (developers don‚Äôt want to make new cosmetics, even if just reskins.)
B.) (Hopefully) satisfy people demanding ‚ÄúOG Styles‚Äù
C.) Reward people who support EPIC by buying skins.

and EPIC would
D.) Make more money. Players would ‚Äúgamble‚Äù (if you would) on a skin they think might end up with an OG style. People are much more likely to buy skins if they think they might get one.

I barely was able to hit anyone.

GAME 1:
I landed at tilted and I was expecting to die right away. And I did. I was running and got dropped right away. I was fine and expected this.

GAME 2:
Landed at the mall. I got a infantry rifle (that‚Äôs what I think it was called) and a guy runs up to me. I hit him once then he TRIPLE HEADSHOTS ME. I am kind of pissed but I expected these kind of sweats.

GAME 3:
Landed mall again and I ran into another guy. I had a shotgun and he had a pistol. Easy kill right? WRONG. I hit him for ~40 damage. Then he built a wall and immediately edited it so it had an opening and killed me. I had no time to react. At this point I was pissed.

GAME 4: 
I got killed before i hit the ground.

GAME 5:
Landed at lucky landing and got into a fight. This guy headshots me with a shotgun then finishes me off immediately. TTV in the name go figure. After that game I was done. I just quit and uninstalled the game. 

I really enjoyed this game back in S1,2, and 3 but it was just so unenjoyable to play it. I loved playing it at the end of the day but now after those 5 games, I‚Äôm probably never gonna touch this game again.",FortNiteBR

This is MY OPINION. 

Assault rifle category:
Assault Rifle/SCAR: Stay in the game

Burst/FAMAS: Stay vaulted

Scoped AR: Vault it, no one uses it

Thermal AR: Unvault it, but make it Rare/Epic

Heavy AR: Stay in the game, but make it like it used to be, higher damage and higher rarity

Suppressed AR: Stay vaulted

Infantry: Vault Uncommon/Rare, keep Epic/Legendary

Tactical AR: Stay in game

SMG category:
OG SMG: Stay vaulted

Suppressed SMG: Stay in game

Tactical SMG: Unvault, and me personally I'd make it Rare/Epic/Legendary

New SMG: Stay vaulted

P90: Stay vaulted

Drum Gun: I think stay unvaulted, because it is now a little balanced

Shotgun category:
Pump: Unvault please

Tactical: Vault please.

Heavy Shotgun: Unvault but increase damage a little and make it Rare/Epic

Double Barrel: Stay vaulted

Combat Shotgun: Stay in game

Sniper Rifle category:
Bolt: Honestly, keep it in the vault, Suppressed snipers are literally the same but suppressed.

Semi Auto: Vault it again, useless imo

Heavy Sniper: Stay in game

Suppressed: Stay in game

Pistol category:
Revolver: I would Unvault it for guilty pleasure

Suppressed Pistol: Vault it, I don't see many people use it(sorry Ceeday)

Hand Cannon: Stay in game, but buff damage to structure again

Dual Pistols: Make it Epic/Legendary again

Six Shooter: Keep it vaulted

Scoped Revolver: Keep vaulted

Flintlock: Make Uncommon/Rare, way more powerful for it to be such a low rarity

The skill gap has widened so much that anyone who isn't playing this game every day has next to no chance of winning. There's new metas all the time and for someone that works a lot or has school, it's impossible to keep up with. I used to be able to win at around 2% on solos and now it's literally impossible to win without some fully leveled up player forcing a build battle me and killing me with double SMGs or whatever the new meta is. 

Competitive playing has literally ruined this game, it used to be fun to play because it's kind of arcadish and goofy, now all the good players have it down to a science leaving anyone who doesn't waste their life on this game in the dust. I'm done with Fortnite for a while, until Epic finds a way to bridge this skill gap. There's legit no viable strategy for someone without intense building ability other than camping.",FortNiteBR

Yes some of these people are doing it for badness but some aren't. There are a few things you have to take into consideration before calling someone out for being a ""Fake Noob"".
 1. Some people like the look of the skins and like to use them in game.
2. Some people play the game very often but either can not afford a skin or dont think the skins are worth the money they can cost.
3.  A person might just have a new accout as the other one got banned .ect.

The point i am trying to make here is that the community should treat a ""No Skin"" in the same way as they would treat any other skin in the game.  ITS JUST A SKIN.üëç",FortNiteBR

Do you guys think it the fortnite community on Reddit came up with like 4-5 key points that really need to be fixed that they would even look at it? If so what 5 things would you want fixed and why?

My 4

1-Building-I know people phasing underneath the map was a problem, but come on epic. You are really trying to tell me that a game company like yourself, doesn't have the resources to find a better solution than to have people phase through your builds instead of through the map. It is absolutely ridiculous that i can build a floor on top of someone and they can either shoot through it or simply jump through it. This is incredibly annoying and a horrible game mechanic.

2-Shotguns- I understand that you wanted a better close range meta and its not normal in FPS's for people to carry two shotguns. Thats fine, you tried to nerf DP by reducing shotgun damage. Great, fantastic. Then you added switch time countdowns, as well as how long it takes to actually pull out the pump. With the new SMG, using a pump(because lets be honest, the tactical shotgun fucking sucks) is so difficult. Especially with the way shotgun damage works now. If youre going to do all that to nerf shotguns, i would love for the damage to be where it was before they messed with it. They want people to use shotguns but i draw further away from then in favor of the new smg every time i hit someone point blank for 13 damage. I have never seen, at any point in this game, anyone put down a blue pump for an smg. That meta is just awful and the balance that they tried to implement with the close range game is now in favor of the new smg(not to mention they didnt like tac subs being used a medium range, yet i can laser someone way further away with this disgustingly overpowered weapon)

3-Splode damage- The reduce in what you can carry was a fantastic idea. But the damage the GL does now is fucking insane. Unless you have an endless supply of materials or you're a god builder, its so hard to counter. It makes it was easier for bad players to get the edge on players who have higher skill.

4-C4-Do i really need to explain this? Theres already enough items in the game that give bad players the advantage. Take this garbage out or reduce the damage. Makes no sense in how two c4s can take down the big building(trump) in tilted. That is downright stupid.

Again these are my thoughts. I know epic wants new players to be able to flow into their game nicely, but some of these things really need fixing. ",FortNiteBR

The first time was uneventful. 

The second time the player was already down in the storm but I had several med kits so I went into the storm and revived him, gave him a medkit and drove us to safety. He was grateful enough that he gave me a gold scar when we hit the circle. 

From there things fall apart...

Four times after picking people up and only driving about a quarter of the way to the circle someone in the cart Boogie bombed me causing me to exit the cart, which they then stole and left me to die to the storm. 

Another time I picked up 2 guys from my own squad (who had matching screen names) and they not only boogie bombed me, but they c4‚Äôd me and together boxed me in and stink bombed me to death, they then entered the box and fake healed me before in unison doing take the L. 

Several times I would pull up to teammates and before I even came to a complete stop one would try Boogie bombing me to steal the cart.

The final time I tried to drive someone to safety they kept building obstacles in front of me to either crash into or flip off from until the cart flipped and when I got out to flip it upright he of course Boogie bombed me and stole the cart leaving me to die.

Epic, please take the Boogie Bomb out of 50v50! I don‚Äôt think there has ever been a single time a Boogie Bomb was used against an enemy in that mode. It‚Äôs always used by a teammate to troll, steal a chest or steal he ATK. Impulse grenades were remove, now it‚Äôs time to remove the Boogie Bomb. It just makes 50v50 more toxic than it already is.

I have never paid him much mind while he was playing the game up until it came out on mobile. He wanted me to download it on my phone so he could try it out and see how it was. This was mid season 3. So one day I decided to take interest in the game since he loves it so much, as a way to bond with him! Needless to say I sorta kinda *secretly* probably like playing as much as he does. It has definitely made us much closer! 

Now all that to say this. He went to a local camp this past Sunday and will be back this Saturday. He was worried about being so far behind in season 5 once he gets home so he asked me to play on his account for him. Well I have been grinding it out! I have played much more than I normally would which in turn has made me a way better player *I think*.

Today I got 2 solo wins back to back. No camping involved, I really was just trying to complete the challenges and just got lucky! I wish he was here to celebrate with but he isn‚Äôt so I just had to tell someone!! 

Also, I am 30 and his MOM! :)

I love playing Fortnite and am a proud Xbox player. I watch Friday Fortnite and other tournaments and am saddened that PC and PS4 dominate.

This has led me to create a new subreddit geared at primarily facilitating tournaments for xbox players. If this sounds like something you are interested in, head on over to redit.com/r/fortnitebrxbox.

Right now, we're an army of 2. I'd love for the subreddit to grow to the point where we can get regular tournaments going. I envision a, ""friendly but competitive,"" environment where we take the game seriously but at the end of the day want to have fun. Furthermore, I want this to be community driven as opposed to myself or just a few people being dictators. 

Importantly, this is meant to be inclusive regardless of skill level. The only requirements be that you play on Xbox, and aren't here to fuck shit up.

So come, join the community, share your thoughts on what you would like to see, and let's create a great spot for Xbox players to unite!

Sincerely,

I consider myself decent, but don't really have enough time to play as good as i would like to. Make of that what you will.
I love the game. It is one of the best PvP Experiences i have ever had. I think Epic is setting a new standard with what we should expect from a developer. I have payed for Battle Pass at the beggining of season 2 and don't ever have to spend a dime to fully enjoy the game. However i do need a break.
Not to say i will not play at all, but i am not buying this seasons Battle Pass, and will do my best not to care about the challenges. I cannot spare the time to get it whole and my OCD will not let me leave it unfinished. I was unable to unlock full Omega last season and it hurts.

(solos),"Went from having a 12-15% win rate since season 1 to now having a 3% win rate this season (out of about 200 games). And its not just my wins either, I used to have about a 3.5 K/D now I am down to a 1.2.

Im not sure whats happened but its like I have all of the sudden lost my ability to be above average at the game. 

1. I feel like nearly everyone I get into a build battle with out builds me with ease and constantly caps me off. Build battles are now always a game of me desperately trying to retake high ground but them capping me off at every corner. And whats even more disappointing is to look these people up and see that they have less than 200 games TOTAL whereas ive been playing since season 1 thousands of games.. like how are all these new players this much better/faster than me at building?
2. I read all over this sub that the meta is now to essentially spam walls down instead of build battling looking for a good shotgun shot, so I watch some streamers to get an idea. All I see are people building a few ramps/walls to start spamming the other dudes walls down while they try to build and keep up the spam, its that simple, so I decide to try it. Literally every time I try it I either get sniped in the dome by the guy im fighting (and no I don't just stand still and spam), I get sniped by some other dude watching our battle, or the guy im fighting has the same strat and spams as well and I get out bloom'd/sploded.

I honestly cannot figure out what im doing wrong.. and I want to improve so badly, I was planning on seeing some improvement this season but instead I have just gotten worse? Should I just throw in the towel at this point, like why have I all of the sudden lost my ability to be good at this game? Anyone else experiencing something similar?",FortNiteBR

However many people did not have the skill to build fast or be accurate with shotguns and cried ‚Äú9 dmg‚Äù when they were shooting legs from 10 feet out like it should be a one hit. These people were too stubborn to improve their aim or building skills so epic responded by nerfing shotguns (removed pump-tac shotgun for no reason too; I‚Äôm fine without double pump) and nerfed building through overturning every single explosive + minigun, and then overturned every smg. By doing this epic is tailoring the game for the unskilled player who refuses to get better, and now the skill cap is lowered. Now every post I see asking for a shotgun buff or explosive nerf are bombarded with people saying they should stop building so much or change their habits and use different weapon, but these are the same people who cried for a building nerf and shotgun nerf because they didn‚Äôt have the aim nor skill to compete.

One glaring exception stands out to me, however. Epic recognized the power of rockets enough to feel like they needed to address endgame rocket spam with unintuitive ammo limits, but they failed to recognize the actual problem: perfect aim, unlimited range explosives don't match with the rest of the game.

""The battle is building."" Well, unless your opponent has the high ground and a few rockets. Rockets are easy to use, insanely powerful, and negate the most core aspect of the game entirely. A person with rockets can instantly thwart anyone trying to build up to them. They blow up a huge amount of a base without any difficulty in execution. They have no counterplay in the very early game. If someone near you opens a rocket launcher out of a chest at the beginning of the game, either they miss somehow or you die. 

Explosive are crucial to a game like this, especially building. But making explosive weapons that take no skill to aim, no close proximity to be effective, and no easy way to block now that explosions go through walls, just gives a huge advantage to whoever has the rockets. I love grenade launchers, grenades, clingers, c4 all because they take some skill to use effectively in a fight. The point-and-clickability to negate most fight strategies just doesn't seem good for the game.

The reason I say the rocket launcher should be vaulted is because nerfing the damage enough to not destroy a whole base would make them crap, and making them more rare would just make it feel more unfair if someone has one against you. It's a weapon that would only enhance the game if it disappeared because it would open up the endgame for more close quarters brawling without someone easily point-and-click demolishing anyone building up to them or below them fighting.

I haven't really discussed this with anyone so perhaps I'm the only one that feels this way. Feel free to tell me why I'm wrong. But from my experience, it feels like this would be a better game without the rocket launcher.

tl;dr: Rockets are too unrestricted by aim or range requirements to the point that they completely overpower the strategies that make this game unique, but nerfs wouldn't really fix it without making it useless, so it should be vaulted.",FortNiteBR

That is not true.

Before the removal of double pump and addition of the new insanely high damage SMG, the meta was already shifted towards spam weapons, and while it was still not ideal, a variety of different loadouts were viable. You could run a single tactical shotgun, double pump, pump/tac, pump/ SMG, even pump/dual pistols, etc. and still perform more or less just as well. While I don't fault Epic for removing double shotguns and I appreciate the new pellet consistency, *they need to be buffed considering they were balanced around the double shotty meta.* It's simply no longer competitive to run a single shotgun, especially a pump, given the low DPS and unnecessary pullout time.

Now it is absolutely mandatory to have a spam weapon such as an SMG/tommy gun/LMG or you will be screwed. I appreciated the buffs that SMGs originally received because it slightly reduced RNG early game by allowing you to have a fighting chance regardless of what close range weapon you picked up, but it's clear through the completely unnecessary new SMG that Epic is intentionally forcing this spam weapon meta even further than it needed to go -- and that's not to mention the potential addition of a legendary SMG.

As for counterplay, RPG/Grenade Launcher/C4 spam is often not counterable whatsoever (especially in squads when your opponents have high ground) given the absurdly wide structure damage radius. A reduction in ammo cap for these weapons means nothing in terms of balance when they will destroy everything with click of a button.

TL;DR: Shotguns remain nerfed into the ground after the removal of double shotty while spammy spray-and-pray weapons were buffed much further than they needed to be, drastically reducing the variety of possible loadouts, while explosive weapons now have a ridiculous blast radius and often have now counterplay to speak of.

I fail to see how Epic could possibly in good heart be striving to introduce ""a wide range of play styles and counterplay"" when they are forcing the exact opposite of that. We all know what happened to Paragon.",FortNiteBR

If theres any OP weapon in the game right now its easily this one. Takes almost no skill to use and get easy kills. Sure the lack of amunition during early game kinda balances this but on later game theyre an absolute beast. Ive even stoped using ARs because of this, the silenced smg can perform just as well -if not better- than even a scar or a famas.

Drum Gun is awful. Sure it doesnt have first shot accuracy so it doesnt works well at far range but it just shreds at medium/short. The LMG was good because the accuracy on that thing was awful, the drum gun has good accuracy and a faster fire rate than the other ARs. Sure ive gotten some easy kills with this gun but other players have killed me in pretty bs ways. 

Shotguns need a buff, people not being able to double pump is great but at least remove the equip time

Explosives need a nerf. They do way too much damage to structures, especially the c4. Its just no fun trying to outbuild your oponent just for him to explode a c4 package and knock you down with no effort...  

Double pistol is great, best adition to the game since the famas. Yeah not a complain, just wanted to share my love for it. ",FortNiteBR

""1,000 AR damage"" is lame but easy, and it's kind of pickybacking off of ""SMG damage"" last week, so it gets a pass.


""Eliminate 3 Opponents in Paradise Palms"" is fine. It's a new area so naturally it'll be a challenge.


""Score a basket on different Hoops"" is also unique and it shows off the toy items from this season, so I'm happy with it.


""Search between..."" Not very original and to be honest they get leaked immediately so it's kind of disappointing but again there was one last week and it's just a free tier.


**Shit Challenges**


We had ""Open 7 Ammo boxes in a single match"" last season, and it's a really uninteresting challenge. You basically have to take a game to go somewhere like Lucky Landing and just grab the ammo boxes.


""Open 7 Chests"" has been done to death, and Loot Lake of all places is not only a horrible fucking place but it was a challenge last season. I would have been ok with it if they had changed Loot Lake already but evidently that's not happening quite yet.

""Sniper Eliminations"" is fucking awful. You can obviously get it somewhat easily in Duos or Squads but seeing as you can literally get it as a daily challenge I see no good reason for it to be a challenge this season.


Overall, a kind of lame week. The challenges are more tedious than anything. The only upside is they aren't ridiculously hard, so it's basically just free XP and tiers.",FortNiteBR

In short :

‚Ä¢ Slot to carry Stink Bombs only (Max 5)

‚Ä¢ Stink Bombs are now Rare and not Epic (Drop rate increased)

257,JustinCogan,1532003778,905gi2,60,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/905gi2/new_map_season_6/,64,New map Season 6,"First of all, I‚Äôm not a leaker. I‚Äôm a huge fan of Fortnite that spends too much of my time digging into the little details that Epic throws at us and I try to paint a picture. Here it is. 

Ever since season 3, we all have had one question, when is a new map coming ?! Well, based on the knowledge of many leakers / data miners and fans like me , I can say with full confidence that season 6 will not only bring a new map, but it will launch the full version of the game. 

Ragnar√∂k is not only the tier 100 skin and a kick ass Thor movie, it is also a series of events from Norse Mythology. Simply put, Ragnar√∂k is a series of events, starting with a battle , then death to many major figures, numerous natural disasters and the subsequent submersion of the world in water. After these events the Gods will have a new and fertile land to repopulate the land however they chose fit. 

There are 3 main things to look out for in the next coming days and weeks. The great winter / thimble winter kicks off the entire Ragnar√∂k. Data miners have found a snow texture falling from the rifts , similar to the sand falling from them. The next is sun and the moon disappearing. Keep looking up whenever you can. And the last is the √Üsir (Aesir) God Baldr , who is the Harbinger of Ragnar√∂k. If you look at the skin, it is apart of the Harbinger set. Harbinger means foreshadowing something. I think this means that it is foreshadowing it‚Äôs name, the Ragnar√∂k. 

Now this may seem a little far fetched because it‚Äôs mythology and we don‚Äôt know which universe Fortnite takes place in. But , any marvel fan knows that Greek and Norse mythology crosses over multiple times. And since we have already had a visitor from Greek Mythology (Thanos, titans are Greek, he is not a god) , who says we can‚Äôt see Norse ?! 


Please leave me any questions, comments or concerns from this. I‚Äôd love to talk about it. ",FortNiteBR

However, as a devout pump user, I have to disagree.

Pump shotgun advantages:
‚Ä¢ Higher base damage

‚Ä¢ Tighter spread (More consistently high damage and a longer range)

‚Ä¢ Better combo starter (pump -&gt; smg)

‚Ä¢ Better for players who build in between shots

‚Ä¢ Potential to one shot anyone with less than 160-170 health

Tactical shotgun advantages:

‚Ä¢ Much faster rate of fire

‚Ä¢ More reliable stand-alone close-range weapon

‚Ä¢ Can be pulled out more quickly (thus better for situations like edit plays)

‚Ä¢ Much more forgiving of missed shots

As you can see, the pump still has enough advantages to justify using it over a tactical shotgun. It seems it has reached a point where choosing between the two shotguns is purely personal preference and depends on the player‚Äôs play style.

Weapons - in general - should take longer to fire after being swapped.","The fact that you can switch weapons and begin firing neigh instantly is quite silly in a game with as much possibility as Fortnite has.

You shouldn't be switching weaponry in the middle of a heated gunfight where both of you are out in the open, that's just silly.

If you need to switch weaponry, you are given the tools to do so safely via the means of building a temporary defense. As it is, swapping weapons has become commonplace as an oppressive strategy, where, if you do not take advantage of this -bad mechanic- you are going to be left behind.

If we really want to see this fixed, there needs to be a longer gate between swapping weapons and firing another.

I think an excellent way to do this would to be giving weapons different ""release"" timers before they can be shot. For example: You obviously should not be pulling out a sniper rifle in the middle of a CQB. 

This would be another way of bringing pistols up to par in terms of usability throughout the latter phases of the game. 

They fixed double pump, but the mechanic is simply going to be exploited in a different manner.

For the rest who actually want to read what I've got to say, here's a legitimate thanks. I've been playing since the start of Season 2 and I've got a lot to say.

My reason in making this post is to highlight my personal thoughts on why the shotgun meta was making this game stale very quick. 

**Pump Shotguns**:

The Pump Shotgun had been considered a god tier weapon for a long time until the recent nerfs; swap delay, damage reduction, and now the double shotgun swap nerf. I believe that the first two changes were beneficiary to the game as a whole, because it meant that I wasn't going to be double pumped by someone in kess than a second, and I wasn't going to be one-shot before I saw my target, after I spent my time finding max shield.

The One Pump Issue:

My personal problem with the one pump is that it was a broken mechanic. Yes, it made squad fighting easier, and yes, it required aim. However, a well placed headshot does not take the most skilled player to pull off. In fact a no skin could probably have landed one or two in a a game. The problem with this mechanic was that it negated all shield that you had accumulated. You could have spent a solid four minutes finding max HP but died in less than a second. While this could be combatted with a wall or a staircase, it was still an unfair advantage an enemy could get because any other weapon would not one-shot, and that made the game unfun to play against, because you were given no fighting chance. So, it is my belief that the one pump was necessary to be removed. 

Swap Delay: This killed the double pump, a broken mechanic from Day 1. While double pump has very recently been officially killed, we should talk about why this had ruined fighting at close range. This made it incredibly easy to win one of those spastic jump fights  where you and some default skin jump around like an extreme version of ring around the rosy until someone dies. This made it possible for one person to stand still and abuse the high damage output of the shotgun, which was essentially abusing a game mechanic. The more a game mechanic is abused, the more frustrating the game gets to play for a majority of players.

**SMG Meta**

With the introduction of the Drum Gun and the newly added SMG, a new meta has arose, and it's already getting complaints, what a shocker. The SMG is our new microwave weapon, and the same players who adored the shotguns are now extremely frustrated about the shift. I think that this is a refreshing change for the state if the game, because we're no longer required to pickup a pump or tac shotgun to kill our opponents at a close range. We've always been able to do this with the SMGs but it's only now that more people are picking them up. In a recent state of development update by Epic they announced that they wanted to make weapons in the game feel of use since shotguns were dominating too much. They've achieved exactly that, the only weapons that are being skipped now are pistols, which is understandable. This is good for the game, because it promotes playing the game how you want to. Shotguns are still doing a good ampunt of damage, and the SMG just adds on as a.quick finisher, or your primary close range weapon of choice. 

**How To Tune the SMG To Perfection**

We've all been in a situation where we've gone turtle and someone is spamming our wall with an SMG, getting a few shots in while at it. While it certainly is a viable strategy to double layer yourself by placing a pyramid to get the extra heals off, or using stairs to edit out the top of the box, the SMG is still hitting shots thrpugh ypur wall while turbo building. We can fix this by lowering the rate of fire to be just above the the time it takes for turbo build to replace a structure. Thus, allowing for a more enjoyable experience while fighting SMG spam, and would be a simple QoL change.

**Conclusion:** 

It is still perfectly viable to use either type of weapon in the game, but the shotgun changes are making it a refreshing experience to use more than one type of weapon per game. Allowing players to have a more fullfilling experience, and letting us pick and choose our playstyle, rather than lock it to the shotgun.

I have been playing on ps4 and in my opinion i have become really good to console standards, but to me and I think to a lot of console players in the same or similar place and me feel that the controller is a handicap, its been a long argued war about PC vs Console but in the end they both have their ups and downs, and one of the downs of console is how restricting the controller is, it doesnt have the same movement that a mouse can have or the keyboard switching between slot 2 and 4. Edits on console are horrible where you have to hold the button down to edit where on pc its a quick button press, or how on console its difficult to follow an enemy with your cross hair without aim assist, and you cant flick shot snipers or shotguns quickly without high sensitivity, but sometimes high sensitivity on console can be crazy where you are moving too fast.

https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Boiltheoil

Reason 1: a bad player can kill you so easily they just spam my building whether it be with a Drum gun, SMG, Minigun, Rocket launcher, Grenade launcher, C4, it burns through all my materials because it just destroys it all without requiring any skill. 

Reason 2: shotguns suck and are hardly worth picking up anymore (besides the Heavy). Shotguns are one of the most skillful weapons in the game because if you miss your shots you are probably dead but on the other hand if you land your shots you are rewarded and usually get the kill. Now even if you hit your shots some shitty player can sit there and hold the shoot button with an smg and laser you even if you land most of your shots. Another thing I don't like about shotguns are that heavy shotguns are better than the Tac/Pump in almost every way, before you could have a gray (now green) pump and be good for the rest of the game. Sure the Pump was pretty strong but it helped the game not be so random so that everybody at least had one good gun as to now where the guy with the Heavy has a better chance against the guy with the Pump/Tac.

Reason 3: somewhat related to the first point splodes are ridiculous right now. They use 1 rocket or C4 and all your building is gone, you need 1 brain cell to use a C4 or Rocket launcher and for it to have the impact that it does is ridiculous. 

What do I think epic should do: First off revert the change that made rockets destroy an entire 1x1 and nerf C4 radius, and make grenade launchers fire rate 0.85 seconds from 1 second. Secondly get rid of the Pump switch delay, (not the thing they added this patch) and they should also make the Pump do 95/100 body damage, but keep the headshot damage at 190 to prevent one Pumps. Next buff the Tac body damage to 70/76/82 (140/152/164 headshot) to keep the Tac viable. Lastly nerf/change automatic weapons which include the new SMG, Silenced SMG, Drum Gun, and Minigun. The silenced smg needs slightly higher bloom because it is way to easy to laser somebody from longer ranges. The new SMG and Drum Gun should have their fire rate lowered by 1 they shoot way too fast. The Minigun is a niche weapon but can be very strong in squads or duos while being garbage in solos because of the charge time. What they should do with the Minigun is lower damage to structures to 29/30 and lower the charge time slightly. This makes it a little better in solos and its still effective in squads/duos. 

These are changes that I think will help the game please upvote if you agree.",FortNiteBR

ARs are basically USELESS now to pick up. I never pick up ARs anymore. I will roll SMG, shotgun, tommy gun, sniper, and heals. ARs and the bloom need to be reworked and made some what useful. They have NO use right now. New MP5 shreds build, so why would someone spray walls with an AR? There's simply no purpose for the AR right now and something needs to change.

Explosives. Why you guys buffed explosives to take down an entire tower in tilted in 1 rocket, I don't know (Im being sarcastic). But 10 C4 max and the explosion radius you guys put on all explosives? Really? I'd be 10/10 happy if you guys completely removed explosives, as shitty players in this game sit in their 1x1s and spam rockets at you. Don't get me wrong, the limited rocket count was a great change on your guys' half but holy hell, the explosion radius should have stayed the same as before. Or at least half the current explosion radius. Nothing like trying to out build a guy and he spams 1400 C4s until you're 2 hp and stuck at the bottom.

Shotguns. I give you guys an applause for fixing double pump. Get the double shotguns out of here. (Before you guys say, you can't double pump, I was actually extremely nasty with it and I abused the shit out of double shotgun. I'm glad to see it go honestly.) But now that you can only carry one shotgun and/or an SMG to follow it, shotguns need a buff back to how they were. The pump needs to do it's normal damage and the vanilla tactical shotgun, up close and personal, is a DAMN MARSHMALLOW shooter. The thing is AWFUL EPIC.

Hunting Rifle. All the snipers are perfectly fine in my opinion. There's a bug with the hunting rifle that when uncrouching and crouching with the hunting rifle while 3rd personing behind a wall causes your reticle to shoot downwards when you go to shoot a player. My reticle is not acting natural and I can tell the hunting rifle is currently fucking up right now when I go to shoot. The old hunting rifle was perfect and I could quick peek with it without my camera getting fucked up; now, not so much the case. That thing needs to have first shot accuracy 100% of the time.

Then some people want to argue, ""double pump was op it needed to get removed"". Again this is false, double pump at the end of season 4 was weaker than pump smg by a long shot; a lot of people just didn't explore season 4 meta enough to realize pump smg was the dominate load out even in season 4! Y'all just got PTSD from the OG double pump making you think that double pump in season 4 was OP. Now this subreddit wants to complain that the meta is terrible when it is was the constant complaining of the double pump that got it removed in the first place. If this game wants more diversity in terms of shotguns they should either make it so a single pump is viable or bring back double shotgun, because at the moment the only real viable option is pump smg or pump drumgun.

First, I want to say that I'm not complaining because I feel the game is more casual, skill gap smaller, killing less good players harder, I still have around the same skill level that I had in the previous META. Besides that Solos vs 2+ is way harder/impossible. 

I mostly wanna say that from 5h of Fortnite a day (at minimum)/everyday , I am now playing 2h in average, way less solos (way more 50v50), and that's because I'm not having as much fun as I did before. 


I think that the current meta is contradictory with the idea that building is a crucial element of the game. 

Now as long as you have explosives, you‚Äôll hardly have to outbuild your opponent and as long as you get in people‚Äôs faces and spray, you don't really have to aim that well since bloom will be here to give you those sweet headshots (So many no FSA weapons). 


Basically , the only way to adapt to this new META is to conform to it.

You don't like Smgs and spray weapons? just use them. 

You don't like getting sploded or C4-ed? Use them, abuse them against everyone.


And here is the the problem. Epic said here :

 https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/counterplay-and-play-styles

And I quote ""We strongly believe that the evolution of Fortnite supports a wide range of play styles and counterplay"" 


Yes, we've seen another, different playstyle emerging, a playstyle that may be easier for the casual player, BUT WHAT I HAVE SEEN is that the changes doesn‚Äôt encourage any gameplay ‚Äúvariety‚Äù. 

They force you to change your playstyle drastically if you aren‚Äôt using what everyone else is using; A.K.A Explosives + Spray weapons.

You don't have the choice, you'll have a big disadvantage if you avoid this type of loadout. 

Building could be countered before, by building. It counters itself, that's where the skill gap was, now, You almost don't need to build, I'm serious when saying that, you can easily survive by only using 500mats (For fights).

Pump was OP, yes maybe, but the recent damage nerf is useless especially after removing double pump (but OS removal is fine) , the pump delay added in april should be removed now that there's the new ""pump switch timer"".

Tac shotgun is really bad, it's reticle is way too big, even with decent aim, shots from further than 3m will do extremely low damage, even when crouching +ADS. Honestly tac shotgun feels like a CaC weapon (CaC as in knife or pickaxe). 


I would also like to address a main problem of the game that is ARs.

Even after the Silenced SMG nerf I still take them over ARs, they are way more reliable at ~100m, and usually in fortnite, we avoid 100+m fights (or just move closer quickly).

Why? Because of damage drop off and FSA that requires to be sitting in a 1x1 ghost peeking.
S-SMG don't need another nerf, it's a great weapon now but ARs needs a buff somehow.

That's all I have in mind for the moment, I don't expect a lot of constructives answers from people here, no offense it's just my experience, but if anyone agrees or disagrees, there's votes and comments, feel free to use those two features. 

Hope you all have a great day, excuse my English, I'm not native.

Was walking from a shop to a house, he saw me and held down left click, had no mats so I hid behind a building, he sprayed down the building, came close and I got a full point blank tac headshot, he didn't die. I died to the SMG.

Spectated the guy till he died, he never sprinted, only walked, had a default pickaxe. When he saw an enemy he continued walking towards the guy, held down left click but the other guy had mats so he built, other guy shotgunned him and won.

The purpose of this story is to show how OP and pointless SMGs are now. I watched him for a solid 5 minutes, and you could tell he was a bad player, very new to the game cause she didn't farm mats at all. He killed me, a moderately skilled, experienced player.

This isn't me raging about dying, and before the ""just cause you died doesn't mean it needs nerfing"" comments, this player was genuinely but, yet I died and there was nothing I could do, skill is literally now irrelevant except building, but SMGs can also destroy building really effectively now.

I‚Äôve seen numerous posts on it and wanted to give my take. Of all the metas, from double pump, to double heavy, to carrying 50 rockets, the smg meta is the least skilled and most OP meta there is. Shotguns took skill to use and hit shots, but the smg is just press R2 and everything will hit. They shred through buildings, and what is even more stupid is that even while turbo building, person spamming smg still gets a shot off or two on me, which is stupid. I think they need to be toned down to a complimentary weapon, not a main up close weapon.

Epic stated they want diversity, but there really isn‚Äôt any right now. Pistols are still shit, you can‚Äôt rock just a shotgun, explosives dominate late game, and ARs are becoming unusable due to bloom. It is ridiculous how people use SMGs as their AR spot. My suggestion is this: tone down explosives: all of them. C4s, GL, and RPGs shouldn‚Äôt be able to knock down a 4 layer ramp combo, it should be able to knock down double ramp and ramp wall at the most. Tune down the damage done to structures for smgs, miniguns, and LMGs. This way, building becomes the meta again, as it should since it is a ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù game Epic. There are also very important issues that Epic needs to address (such as the phasing, worst mechanic in the game), but this era of ‚Äúspam‚Äù needs to be tuned up on",FortNiteBR

Blue Pump: 95 Damage, 10 Pellets


9.5 Damage per pellet (if it's a point blank bodyshot)


95 total damage (if it's a point blank bodyshot)


Headshot multiplier is 2.0x


So total damage : 190 (if it's a point blank headshot)

19 damage per pellet (if it's a point blank headshot)

Some damage is reduced based on distance, couldn't find the statistics on this though, sorry.

Now if you shoot someone in the head at point blank range and only 8 pellets hit, it will do (8 x 19) 174 damage. If 5 pellets hit a point blank headshot, that's 95 damage, and so on.

Hope this helps, shotguns work fine, if you constantly shoot 9 damage shots, you need to work on your aim.

---

I always see comments about how people are glad or upset that the 'building playstyle' is getting nerfed or buffed or is OP. 

#You guys are confusing playstyle with mechanics.

Your playstyle is how you choose to utilize the game mechanics.

Playstyles are considered things like playing aggressively and seeking out and rushing enemies, playing defensively to hold a position, or playing stealthily. NOT things like building because all playstyles utilize building and shooting because they are core mechanics, not playstyles.

If you were double ramp rushing opponents, your 'playstyle' would be considered an agressive one. Your means of doing that may be utilizing the build mechanic but that doesn't mean it's a separate playstyle from those who who just run at you guns blazing without ramps. The people who do that are just bad at playing an aggressive playstyle.

Some people build defensively or build forts because they are playing a defensive playstyle. They build big 1x1s and camp and try to defend their positioning instead of pushing other players. Again; this is a playstyle. The act of building is not. The way it is utilized is.

Some people play stealthy and barely build at all because forts can give away your position and these players like to play off the radar entirely. This playstyle is just a minimalist approach to using the mechanics of building and shooting. 

I also see a lot of people saying build *battling* is a playstyle. That is also not true. A build battle is just a shotgun range fight that people of all playstyles get into. If you are not trying to get or maintain an advantageous position (which is how and why build fights occur) then you may be making bad choices. Yes, sometimes c4 or impulses or launch pads or means of escaping can mean you are in an advantageous position without needing to get into a dreaded 999 material build fight and that is fine, but just letting someone have an advantageous position over you is not a playstyle; it is a bad choice. 

(Also I want to add that truly good players switch playstyles constantly and adapt to each individual situation.)

TL;DR Playstyle is how you use the mechanics of shooting and building. Shooting and building are not playstyles.",FortNiteBR

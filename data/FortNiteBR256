However I believe that double shotgun should be brought back as it provides more options for players now that smgs are in a good to very powerful spot in the game right now. Because smgs are so strong at close range currently I believe that players would not be forced to run double shotgun as smgs can compete with shotguns very well I their current state, in fact I actually think right now cqc is not very diverse as it is shotgun smg or just smg period. In conclusion I believe adding back double shotgun would make the game more fun and diverse. I would like this to not only be a suggestion but a discussion to see what the community thinks. Would you guys like to see double shotgun return?

I loved building and how each gun was useful and purposeful. Fast forward to Season 5, Drum guns, SMGs and P-90s dominate this game, and if you don‚Äôt have one, good luck killing someone that does. I remember when you used to be able to clutch out 1v2s and 1v3s through building, but now all people do is spam drum guns and SMGs at you from multiple sides until they phase through your wall and kill you. Shotguns apart from the heavy are nearly useless, ARs are vastly inferior when compared to their SMG counterparts. The newest building nerf made bullet spam weapons even more powerful, it just seems like there‚Äôs no counter to it anymore. Epic buffed SMGs and nerfed shotguns to introduce ‚Äúalternate playstyles‚Äù, but the only viable playstyle is with SMGs. I just wish Epic would realize that this makes the game much less enjoyable. I used to look forward to being able to play this game when I had free time, now I find myself having less and less fun each session I play and I‚Äôm sadly thinking about stopping altogether. Does anyone else feel the same way?

TLDR: SMGs are making the game boring, allowing for only one viable playstyle. The building nerf is pushing the game in the wrong direction, what made this game fun in the first place is vanishing.

Obviously we already have more than just Battle Royale. Save the World has been out since the beginning. But what if there were more free game modes than just Battle Royale?

More game modes in the style of Battle Royale (same weapons, skins, etc.) but different objectives on different maps. There are certainly enough players to fill up the extra lobbies, and these new permanent game modes would draw in even more players.

Now I'll go over some game mode ideas.

TEAM DEATHMATCH-

This is a pretty basic game mode. There would be two teams who spawn on different sides and kill each other. At the end of the game the team with the most points wins. The only difference would be that instead of spawning in with a win loadout, there would be a ""grace period"" at the beginning in which the teams would search their side of the map for materials weapons, etc. and prepare for the fight. Then after the time expires, the no man's land would open up and the game would play out. Essentially it would be a lot like the final circle battle in 50v50 but with a more organized collection time and rather than last man standing it would be whoever has the most points at the end.
Side note: The map would be surrounded by a storm.

STORM SHIELD DEFENDER-

This gamemode is a bit more Fortnite themed than the previous. If you've played STW you'd know about storm shields. Essentially it's just a shield that stops the storm. This game mode would consist of four teams, each with a storm shield. In between the four corners of the map would lie a storm dealing low amounts of damage (1 DPS, I will explain why so low later). The objective would be to destroy the other teams' storm shields before the phase ends. Here is a detailed guide of how the phases would work.

Phase one (five minutes): Grace period
This phase would be essentially exactly like the grace period of TDM. You would not be able to leave your storm shield's circle.
Phase two (five minutes): Storm recession one 
In this phase, the storm would receed and open up the areas in between the teams' storm shields. This would be the time where the teams go and attack the storm shields. Obviously PVP would be enabled with a 5 second respawn time. The aim would be to damage the enemies' storm shields as much as possible (if not destroy them completely).
Phase three (two minutes): Storm return
In this phase, the storm would gradually return to how it was in phase one (one minute). After it returns fully there would be time for healing, rebuilding, etc. (one minute). 
Phases two and three would repeat as four and five, then six and seven, then eight and nine until-
Phase ten (until game end): Sudden death
As the name implies, there would be no respawning in this phase. On top of that, at the beginning of the phase, there would be an announcement saying
""Your storm shield's power is failing!""
At this time, you would begin taking .5 DPS inside your storm shield (still 1 DPS outside of it) and the storm shield itself would begin taking 10 DPS.
Now that I've gone over all the phases, I'll explain how the game would be played out. Obviously the aim would be to destroy all other storm shields. Once a team's storm shield is destroyed, they will not respawn and they will no longer have a safe zone to stay at during the return phase. Once all players on a team are dead, they will have lost.
A few other things to note:
Players would be able to stay in enemies' safe zones during the return phase, but they would be visible on that team's map and would not be able to damage the storm shield. They would respawn back at their own safe zone once killed. 
Legendary weapons would only be found in supply drops spawning outside of safe zones, and the spawn rates would be primarily centered around the very middle.
The teams would be made up of 25 people each. 

CAPTURE THE LLAMA-

This game mode would essentially just be capture the flag but with a Llama. There would be a five minute period to gather weapons, resources, etc. before the main phase starts. Once it starts, players would be able to leave their area and go to the enemy's area. Once you get close enough to the enemy's Llama, you hold whatever button/key you have set for interact for two seconds before picking of the Llama. You would not be able to sprint while carrying the Llama (this requiring teammates to escort the carrier). The Llama could be dropped at any time but would return to the base after fifteen seconds. The fifteen second timer would pause while interacting, but not reset. Once the Llama is taken to the base, it would be dropped on a specific platform. It would then be opened by interacting with it for five seconds. After it is opened that team would receive a point. The first team to five points would win. After fifteen minutes, the game would end and the team with the highest score would win. If the score is even, it would enter a next point to win phase in which the next team to score would win.
These would not work with 100 total players, I was thinking more like 10-15 players on each side, let me know what you guys think though.

TLDR: There should be more game modes in Fortnite. I won't bother explaining anything else just read it.

Preemptive response to this seeming like too many other games:
The Battle Royale genre is dying fast. If Epic Games wants to have a fan base by the end of this year they need to add something new to Fortnite and I think this would be a great addition.

One last thing, I believe I mentioned this already, but these would all be free modes like battle Royale. You would click on what you normally would to enter Battle Royale, but when you select a game mode the options would be ""solos"", ""duos"", ""squads"", ""50v50"", ""[LTM]"", ""TDM"", ""SSD"", ""CTL"". When playing SSD or CTL gamemodes you would be able to have as many members in your squad as the team can fit, and for TDM you could have 10 in your squad.

That's really all I have to say, let me know what you guys think, and suggest any othe game modes ideas you may have!",FortNiteBR

Its most likely known that the massive crack in the sky is spewing sand over the desert and snow over the Viking mountain (if you didnt know now you do). with every patch of season 5 starting around week 5 the snow will start moving toward Snobby and Viking villages will start popping up seemingly moving along with the snow until Snobby is covered with snow and settlements around it, it will be renamed Vile Village along with the challenge of getting chests at snobby being renamed to that by the mid-end of season 5. It wont be destroyed, only added on to. The desert will be expanding up to wailing Woods, i have yet to know what lonely or wailing will be changed to but the bunker had to do with a bit ill explain later. the road trip by week 7 willburst of the giant crack in the sky over tilted, this will be seen in the Week 7 loading screen where Drift and his friends witness it. My source says a building or two in tilted may be destroyed by road Trip, so idk for sure. In the secret 8th Loading screen Road Trip can be seen animating the fake dinosaurs which will be roaming, harmless, and undestroyable (he will basically be making havoc by teleporting buildings to different places on the map, animating inanimate objects, tilting buildings on their sides) near the end of the season there will be an LTM (kind of like infinity gauntlet) where a few people gets to control a few inanimate landmarks around the map such as the big truck transformer near lonely, the roaming t-rex, the greasy burger, etc. As for the bunker, after week 7 there will be a visible golf kart in the bunker with mini guns on the side a rocket on the back and a mounted lmg on top that can be used near the end of the season and what I assume is made to destroy road trip.

A few other things

Tilted, Tomato, and Haunted will get majorly changed in season 6.

road trip is an otherworldly being kind of like the Visitor.

old factories might be rebuilt

this is kind of hard to put into words so bear with me. 

so you‚Äôre in a box. there‚Äôs a staircase, walls, and a floor as the roof. 
you‚Äôre in ‚Äúbuild mode‚Äù (after pressing circle) 
you want to edit the floor (roof) to get out, so you look at it, and hold circle. however, if your building piece (in the bottom right) is on staircase, the system takes priority on the staircase and that will be the only thing you will be able to edit unless you tap the button for floor and then edit the floor. 

the only way to be able to edit what you‚Äôre actually looking at is to get your pickaxe or a gun out. then editing is correct, but you have to go into build mode if you want a build again, which is just another step that shouldn‚Äôt be like that. 

i hope i was clear, i‚Äôve never heard anyone talk about this. also not sure if this is only on console. let me know if you have any experience with this.

Below are the steps. Have fun dudes!

Steps: 1. close game

 1. close epic games client

 2. type ""regedit"" in the ""start"" search box of windows

 3. you can search for ""Epic Games""

You will find two primary locations among other results.

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Epic Games

HKEY_USERS*LONG-STRING-OF-CHARACTERS-REMOVED*\Software\Epic Games

I¬†deleted both of these and their sub contents.

 1. Delete the folder contents of C:\Users\YOUR WINDOWS USERNAME\AppData\Local\FortniteGame

I relaunched the game client and game, joined a random squad and OMG¬†voice chat was working 100% again. Once you reload the game, it recreates those registry values but I assume it puts the correct values for vivox since it works and you can voice chat like usual.

I am really pleased that this is solved for me as its been like 4-5 days with no voice chat since the update.

I even tried reinstalling the game multiple time but it appears that because the registry values already existed (even uninstalled) it did not overwrite them and retained the ""corrupted"" or ""bad"" values for the chat to work.

My hypothesis is that when we all got booted off the servers, something happened to one of those registry values and it is causing authentication failures with vivox voice chat API.",FortNiteBR

One of the funniest parts of the game is to see people's ridiculous names.

I know most of the people using streamer mode are just toxic softies who get really salty when they get outplayed, or little kids who think using streamer mode is cool. I know that doesn't really add to the argument, but it's still true. I get that streamer mode eliminates most of the incentive to stream snipe, and I get that. But it gets so boring when everyone is just a number. There is a pretty simple solution I came up with. There might be some holes in this, feel free to let me know.

Just make streamer mode hide other people's names, but if you aren't using streamer mode, you can see everyone's name. Then, if it's not already a feature, just make it so that people who aren't your friend can't invite you to their party or message you. It still has the same effect on stream sniping, but it also makes the kill feed interesting for people who like to read it (a lot of people by the way).",FortNiteBR

So this will be kind of a long read, but I have a special request for EPIC, and seeing as they are so active and listen to the community a lot, I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot. Some of you might have seen this story earlier in the ""Epic Plz"" thread, but I figured I might as well try to get some visibility by making this post.

So since my parents are split-up, me and my brother do not see our father very often anymore, and it has been this way for a few years. It kinda sucks, so we always have been trying to find ways to stay in touch with him as much as we can, and since we both really like video games, we always tried to get him to play along with us. At first, we tried showing him COD, but he never got into it. We tried the same with NHL, same result. This went on like this with a lot of games, but he never got the hang of it and as much as he wanted to play with us, he just did not have any fun with all these games.

Then came Fortnite Battle Royale. My brother was the first one to download it after trying out PUBG on a PC in some gaming place. He instantly fell in love with the game and decided to show it to us. This was in the middle of Season 2. Needless to say that I instantly liked the game and started playing it a lot. But what was a great surprise for both me and my brother was that our father fell in love with the game as well and after a couple of weeks, he went and bought himself a PS4 along with a PS+ membership. 

After that, he started playing with us a couple of nights per week, when he had some time to. Then, he started calling or texting us almost every night to play with him. Now, every night that we have the opportunity to do so, we play with him, which is a really great way to keep in touch with him while having tons of fun doing something that the three of us enjoy.

At first, we always landed in spots that were unpopular because our father wanted to have a little bit of loot at first without getting killed by someone directly after landing since he was far from being any good.

After a while, they added Lucky Landing to the map. Our father was the first one to visit it between the three of us after the update, and it instantly became his favorite spot. When we first played with him after the update, he was all happy to show us this new point of interest in the map and how he already knew all the spots in this part of the map. The problem is, it became way too intense, to the point where he does not want to land anywhere else than Lucky Landing.

""The bus starts there? Well great, let‚Äôs drop at Lucky Landing as soon as we can drop!""

""Boys, the bus is very far from Lucky Landing, why don‚Äôt we go there? We‚Äôll be alone and have some loot!""

""We‚Äôre kind of in the middle so there can be people anywhere, might as well go to Lucky Landing, what do you think boys?""

Basically, every single reason is good for him to land at Lucky Landing. Now, even if we do not want to go there, he‚Äôll land there, with or without us. This has become kind of a running gag in our family, even with the ones not playing Fortnite (mom, uncles and aunts, etc.) He takes it very seriously and he knows that we‚Äôre kind of making fun of him because of that and we always find new ways to laugh about it, which always (well, very often) make him laugh as well.

The other thing we like to make fun of is his PS4 name, which is star2000star. We do not know why he chose this, but god we found it so funny at first because of how ridiculous it looks. Of course, again, he knows we make fun of him because of that, but he likes to laugh about it as well and always like the new jokes we make about his name.

Being inspired by Mr Hillman‚Äôs funny story, I thought about this and figured I‚Äôd give it a shot and see if EPIC could do something about it. Basically, what I would like would be for something to be added in Lucky Landing with his name on it. It could maybe be only a panel with ""Home of star2000star"" on it, or maybe a grave with ""Here lies star2000star, #100 once again"" on it, just something to honour him since he likes this place so much. It would be yet another way to remind him about his passion for Lucky Landing, while being really funny and a good surprise for him the next time he lands there (well maybe not the next time since it should be in a couple of hours).

I know that the odds are that it won‚Äôt happen, but I figured it was worth trying.

If you‚Äôve read until there, thanks a lot for reading and hope you all have a blast and a lot of wins during Season 5!",FortNiteBR

No. We still do not want SBMM. Not only would it ruin what BR is about, but it simply wouldn't work. The game is free. There would be millions of people using smurf accounts so they can get high kill games. It would just make it so the noobs run into even more sweaties. 

But something needs to be done. This game has a huge skill gap because of the building and not everyone wants to spend the time playing it all day to get good at it. Ruining the game with a spam meta is not the solution though. 

Here are some alternatives: 
1) Add a gamemode with limited building (one is already in the works I hear) and make it permanent. 
Noobs love 50v50 but it's not truly Battle Royale so it's not as fun for them. This would allow people to enjoy the fun of Fortnite Battle Royale without getting destroyed by people who have been playing the game for several months, and it would also allow everyone else to have fun on the normal gamemode without the updates that cater to the noobs. This mode would still have the fun of building, but the skill gap it creates would be so much smaller if it was limited. 

2) Solo is where most of the sweaties are. Add a comp mode to solos. 

Also maybe add a ""Fill"" option to Playground (once it becomes permanent).
This would allow people who don't have friends that play Fortnite to practice with other people and get better. You can then move on to 50v50 to practice your skills and then on to the real thing. For now, you can use the Fortnite discord to squad up. 

Or maybe just make a no-spam weapon gamemode. Those who want to hold left click can play the normal mode and everyone else can go to this one lol

Soon after, I visited iDropz_BoDies stream where he showed the his gameplay using the replay system. As he queued up each replay, the saved games log was displayed and showed big time gaps between his games played. Then I saw something I could hardly believe, his gameplay. It was pathetic and laughable to say the least. At least 75% of his opponents didn't even return fire on him. He'd jump into a rift and then navigate to another POI and land of rooftops of houses his ""opponents"" were residing in (safe from potential enemy fire). And it all became crystal clear what actually transpired. He was queuing in and out of lobbies until he found one with a good mix of his buddies in. Yes, I saw Epic's official response. I don't care. They're lying. Their goto move is to brush this under the rug ASAP and the thought of disqualifying iDropz_Bodies raises concerns over potential lawfuits that might develop as a result. What's been even more disturbing however is the wide scale cover up operation going on. I chatted with MonsterDFace on his stream who had announced that he would be interviewing the guy. I raised my concerns about the legitimacy of the kid's win, and he quickly dismissed me accusing me of ""raining on the parade"", followed with an ""I'm with Epic"" comment. When I asked whether he had watched the gameplay he said ""No man, I don't need to do that"". So, he wasn't even remotely interested to watch the gameplay from the obscure guy with whom he would be interviewing?! Hmmm. He actually later posted that interview on YouTube and then subsequently turned off all comments. And he's not the only one. A ton of Fortnite streamers in the day's following all flipped their chats to Sub only mode, likely in an effort to silence the Fortnite audience that knows something was up. I don't know why these streamers are all circling the wagons for Epic. It could either be out of fear of repercussions, or they're doing what they've been explicitly told from Twitch and/or Epic. 
I have no bones with Epic. I think they've created what might be the best game ever and have put together an amazing business model which has yield them hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more and they deserve it; however, with this move, they've charted off course and are now simply covering their asses instead of doing the right thing and acknowledging what actually took place. I'm a big fan of Fortnite, I've spent over $300 on skins and emotes alone, but I will not be spending a single dollar more unless this is taken care of. And I encourage others to do the same as well. Epic, if you're listening, do the right thing. I know you know what happened. This rules you setup were poorly thought out, and your allowing this to transpire without action is in terribly poor taste.",FortNiteBR

Epic games have been pushing the game to a bloom based meta, trying to be more appealing to new players (noobs) thats not talking about the building nerf but i will get to that in a minute, so Epic games invested 100 million dollars on Esports, do u see what iam talking about they are trying to be more appealing to new players while trying to be an Esports but the game wasen't built to be an Esports it needs a major rework to be an Esport since RNG isnt accpetable on the pro level thats Esports, also pushing shotguns meta away while trying to make the game a spray and pray contest isnt really gonna get you anywere.

Now building, building got nerfed wood can be broken down with two pickaxe hits, so as you can clearly see the game is turning its back on the hardcore players base the players who keeps it alive and trying to get more money from new commers and if Epic would keep on heading that way the game will die sonner than later.",FortNiteBR

The only reason I ask is because you NEED a basketball toy emote to make the shot. And after season 5 ends, anyone who doesn't have the basketball, won't be able to get it anymore. 


So will we see toys being given out for free later on? Or will there be some other means of acquiring the toy? 


If its the later, I wouldnt mind a series of challenges available after the season ends to get some of the important items going forward (like toys in their most basic form, the fancy toys don't need to be sold again after the season is out) 

So like character challenges, you just have to complete a few tasks and you get the basketball toy emote. Any player can complete the challenge at any time to get it, making all tasks possible again for players that missed this season. ",FortNiteBR

Each have a corner of the map where they have a storm shield defense generator that they have to defend while trying to take out the other teams‚Äô storm shield defense generator. Players can respawn when they die, but lose all of their items. Once their generator is destroyed, they cannot respawn.

Instead of a timer for the storm, there would be a timer for different phases. When the timer ends for the phase, the next phase would begin.
 
First Phase - Storm Shield Generators are invulnerable and can‚Äôt take damage (that way teams have time to build bases and get supplies)

Second Phase - Storm Shield Generators are no longer invulnerable and teams can damage them by hitting it with their pickaxe. (Players can not damage their own generator).

Third Phase - Supply drops start dropping continuously in the middle of the map. Teams can then fight each other in the middle to get control of them. (Legendary items are only found in supply drops giving incentive for teams to fight for them).

Fourth Phase: Storm Shield Generators take double the damage.

(OPTIONAL) Fifth Phase: Each time a player dies on your team your Shield Generator takes damage OR Each team is given a certain amount of respawns before they can‚Äôt respawn anymore.

Gameplay Mechanics Options:

-Option One- No weapons are available on the map (besides supply drops) except for a variety of vending machines at each teams‚Äô base. Resources regenerate overtime so players can keep getting supplies.

-Option Two- Chests eventually regenerate as well as the resources so players can continue finding weapons.

Before we begin, let me give some background on me, I've played this game since it's launch and was an OG as kids like to call it to the game and I was obsessed with the game, had over 20k kills in under 8k matches played combined. I liked to consider myself one of the best players of the game on console at the time.

Lets begin:

1. They destroyed shotguns to no end that literally nobody uses shotguns anymore. All the little kids complained so much about getting 1 tapped to the face due to running around a corner like a stupid ass and wondering why someone shoulder peaked them and one tapped them to the face. Instead of using shotguns, everyone runs SMGs, how is that a thing? How is it possible a SMG is a lot better than a SHOTGUN.
2. The biggest thing for me since day one of this game was building, and they still haven't fixed anything besides making building weaker. The issue here is the fact of people walking through walls, floors, and stairs. When you're outbuilding someone that they have no idea what's going on, but then they somehow magically walk through your stair and kill you due to it, yeah, great game.
3. Assault Rifles, this one isn't that big of an issue, but the fact that ARs aren't present anymore in this game and instead are replaced with SMGs is questionable to me and makes me want to think if the developers know anything about how guns work. 
4. C4 and explosives, didn't a lot of children complain so much about how OP the RPG and Grenade Launcher were? Oh wait, lets buff all 3 of them to the point of literally having no counter to them.

TLDR - This game sucks and the developers are destroying it. ",FortNiteBR

It takes less than 1 second to get melted by a normal smg let alone a p90. People complained about one pumping but it's useless now with smg's. I'd rather run two p90s or an smg and p90 for close range.

The end of season 4 was the best and most balanced close range meta even with smg's not having damage falloff. I was running all kinds of close range loadouts and having a blast. Double pump, pump smg, pump tac, pump tommy gun, pump silenced, heavy silenced, heavy pump, double heavy, heavy smg, heavy tommy gun, no shotgun with a tommy and an smg, hell even just one close range weapon was viable. With the new meta shotguns are obsolete almost aside from early game. Ill take a double p90 over a heavy and p90.

It makes no sense and isn't fun for people who enjoyed close range fights, they aren't the same anymore. There is even a glitch where you'll see a wall but bullets and even yourself can travel through it, that's why you get hit occasionally while building by a p90. 

I've grown to love this game (possibly top 3 favorites) over time and I'm not enjoying it near as much due to recent changes. If it keeps heading in this direction they are going to end up killing the game by alienating the streamers and good players who have taken time to get good at the game and learn the mechanics. Spraying through walls and not being able to build in a 1v3 or 1v4 is not how this game worked for over 10 months.

A Ranked mode would be a good way for all players including newcomers to get better since they're not playing against pros. Pros could also get better since they wouldn't be playing against the newcomers who are just easy kills for them.

You drop, and the grind to find a gun starts. You get gun, shield, bandages etc, and continue. You run to the circle, maybe you come across a cart or ATK. You build, hide, scavenge, kill some people, and either win or die. Repeat.

As you all may or may not know, gaming is a business. In fact, it's an 11 figure per year industry.

This makes video game studios no different from any other business when it comes to the economics. They have a business end to the company, and a creative end to the company. The business end essentially runs the company simply due to to the fact that lack of revenue = no company. I know that there are small studios where this may not be the case, but Epic Games is a huge corporation, and in business, if you aren't growing, you're dying.

Like any other business, they've created and maintained a financial model, which includes revenue projections and cashflows. This is the ""master document"" that's used for asset allocation, further business development and general measurements of the life-blood of the company. Also like any other business, they measure their monetary results on a monthly basis against their projections. Being aligned with their projections are imperative to a business. If a business is off, they investigate the reason and shift fire (change their market approach or product or offering).

So what I'm getting at here is that most decisions that come out of a game studio are rooted in finance.

This brings us to the reasons why Epic Games is pushing their game the way they have been recently. The decisions are rooted in finance and justified through analytics (data). They can essentially see everything about how their users play their game and tie it back to revenue. 

If I had to make my own hypothesis, I'd say that their team of data scientists segment the players that spend the most and analyze what their experience looks like, then make a data driven decision to how to improve their experience, resulting in more revenue.

So if they see that their highest spending segment has an average in-game lifespan of 3 minutes, dies to weapon X 60%+ of the time, and gets less than X amount of kills with weapon X, this determines that weapon X is negatively affecting that player segment's experience. This affects revenue, hence a change to weapon X.

The example above is a simplified explanation of how they treat every aspect of the game.

Of course there are outlying variations here and there, but this is essentially how a business in ran, and gaming is a business.",FortNiteBR

1- ""I cant finish the battle pass and get max tier because I work and have a life please make it so that we can finish the skin after the season"".

Again, Epic helping casuals. Now let me tell you that is not an excuse at all let me explain why. One of my friends works Monday to Saturday, for 8 and sometimes 10 hours per day. He doesnt get on everyday, and STILL managed to get Omega level 80, he has a family but he plays with the squad and finds ways to level up faster i see absolutely no excuses people just feel they have to own everything.

2- ""Bring back skulltrooper and ghoul and ginger bread""

Not everyone is suppose to own everything, look at the red knight, is all bots, is always fun to see a rare skin once in a while and be intimidated in thinking they are good. There has to be rare skins and stay that way, I want ginger bread yet I hope is not released ever again. Red knight was rare and intimidating, now it aint shit.

3- ""Make a skin that is unlockable at certain amount of wins, 100, 500, 1000, to determine who is better""

If that ever happens I can already see people complaining is too hard to win and Epic will somehow make it purchasable again, helping casuals.

4- ""P90 iS oP""

Only thing I agree with, rest is just constant bitching.

5- ""Materials do not need a buff they are good how they are"" -Typical Casual.

Do you think that was frustrating for us? Yes! You're right! It was! But what did we have to do? We had to learn how to build better we had to learn to hit our shots. We weren't handed skills on a silver platter. It took lots of hard games of getting brutally outbuilt, outskilled, and outsmarted to finally learn the ropes of the game. And eventually we got the hang of it and now we can compete with most any player out there. So please Epic. Don't teach this generation of noobs that they can cry about everything and expect support. Don't teach them that it doesn't matter what their opponent builds because they can just hold R2 / right click with a P90 in their hands. Don't hand them wins, let them earn it. You're just making the game more aggravating for your dedicated players. And in reality, even from a business standpoint, the changes you're making are absurd. Casuals will come and go with WHATEVER GAME is popular that they can play with their friends. So you'll lose them as customers eventually. But now you're jeopardizing your dedicated fanbase as well. Anyway, rant over. Downvote me to hell, but people should have to learn the game, not be handed it.

TLDR: We all started as noobs and were very frustrated by losing continuously; eventually we will learn the skillset needed to compete, so Epic should not continue catering to noobs. ",FortNiteBR

This would also encourage variety in weapons and loadouts as you'd want to avoid having an inventory that was all using one type of ammo, or was all spray weapons. The more accurate ar may be worth taking over an smg again.

But we still had a great ride along the way - speculating what Omega's plan is, what his evil lair with that massive missile could be, whats going on. We were told a great story. Then The Visitor popped out, broke out of the base, launched the big meme missile, and started Season 5. 

Maybe there will be some big reveal that reveals everything for Season 5's roadtrip screens. Maybe Hokage Naruto Drift will have some big showdown with Ragnarok. Maybe this will lead somewhere.

But even if it does suddenly tie together - atleast in Season 4 we had a gripping story along the way. Season 5 is just drift hanging out at the golf course and the swimming pool.

Explosive arent THAT over powered, especially RPGs and C4. RPGs are loud and slow and if you dont have the reaction time to build a single wall, thats your own fault. C4 is a good combat to building but arent that good against humans. 

Building seriously was not nerfed that bad and tbh they needed to nerf building because not everyone can no life this game become expert builders. People who can build fast and well are immediately put at an advantage of anyone else and it just simply wasn‚Äôt fair. (Thats coming from someone who constantly builds)

Shotguns have always been king of the close quarters, and the AR has always dominated the mid-range, while SMGs were a ""meh"" option that fit somewhere in between. 

Shotguns are still decent in CQB, ARs are still great for the mid-range, but I LOVE having a solid, reliable option for the space in between. 

Yes, the P90 is super strong, but we have never had a truly powerful SMG before. Think about it. The Pump used to one-shot people for days, and the SCAR has always been a total laser beam. It's a big change, having SMGs be so powerful, but I think it's one we can easily adjust to and enjoy.

Epic, you used to be so good about listening to the community and implementing what they wanted into your game. Now you only do that with cosmetics.

You have to stop this and start taking our feedback into consideration with balance patches or this game can end up like destiny 2. For those that don't know, bungie disregarded the communities feedback for the game and made a ton of changes that no one asked for that catered to casual players only and everyone ended up hating them(sound familiar? ). The backlash that the company got was huge and the game lost most of its player base there and they were forced to take content creators to their office to literally tell them what to do to fix their game, to see what the community wanted. They have been implementing more and more of what we want and the game has been in an infinitely better spot than before.

Now that that is out of the way, you guys are going down that same path. Please start to listen to us before it gets to that. I love this game as I have been playing since August and I don't want to see it crumble.

The game won't die out if casuals can't beat veterans, in fact I've seen posts here that casuals want to be stomped by veterans to help them get better. 

Now here is my proposed changes to be made. 

Shotguns need a buff, however I believe the damage they output is in a good spot. The switching mechanics are horrible. At the end of season 4 we had such a wide variety of close range options to choose from and now we have one.

Smgs need a slight accuracy nerf and if that isn't enough then a slight damage nerf. I don't want Smgs to go back into obscurity as they were before but they are a little too present and the accuracy nerf will help bring assault rifles back to their spot. 

Burst rifles needl more accuracy when standing still. 

Hand cannons need better damage falloff as they are outclassed by every other weapon. 

I haven't played with the new explosives changes too much so I can't say too much about those yet but they were unnecessary strong.

And finally revert building to what it was ateast to last patch. This whole game is centered around building and makes it unique to every other battle Royale game. But if no one builds because it's pointless then people will play other ones. Yes spam is annoying but that is just another part of the game to master imo.

So with this, epic please. Please listen to us.

The problem with this is that it causes network related issues and the endgame isn't really fun to watch.
Since reworking netcode can take a year/ years and Epic of course wants to make the endgame fun to watch, they try to nerf building so more people die in the previous circles and the last players can battle without any lags.

I'm certain that this nerf is just a tempoprary solution until they improved their netcode, which still can take many months. When we get to the point where more than 3-5 teams can battle lag-free in the endgame, Epic will start hosting more tournaments full of pro teams.",FortNiteBR

1. At this point in the game, there are so many viable options of weapons and items to pick  hat are far more versatile than a sniper.

Which one of these players has a better ""claim"" to the meta-game?


I happen to be a player that falls into the latter category. I've been playing shooters for a very long time and my aim is solid, its generally what carries me to victories. I happen to be thriving in this recent patch. I consider both building AND shooting as core mechanics of this game and neither the builder or the fragger is any more justified than the other in terms of wanting the meta to be a certain way. The people who complain about how strong building was probably needed to get better at it and the people who complain about how weak is it now probably need to work on their gun-play. I applaud Epic for trying to explore where the middle-ground is between the two mechanics.


Just remember that building isn't the only core mechanic of this game.

If you really like the game and want to improve at it, you have features like playground mode to practise. If these players stop playing because the game is too hard, lets face it, they weren't going to play the game for a long time anyway... On the other hand not catering to new players but rather focusing on existing players is better as they have invested way too much money and time on the game and won't quit.

In addition, if you cater to the new players to try and make the game easier for them, it actually has a reverse effect. The veterans find new metas that the new players haven't thought of and can use those broken weapons against them. If Epic really released the compact smg to make the game easier for new players that was a huge mess up on their part. It just made the game easier for good players. New players who face off against the P90 are just going to have a very negative first impression as they just go against a really broken gun and game is even less welcoming for the new players making it a lot more likely they'll quit. Plus, most new players won't even know which gun is better as they are not as involved in the community. 

The problem is when a skilled player finds the OP gun and goes against another equally skilled guy, the guy with the more overpowered weapon wins which causes the loser to rage and complain.

You can't nerf a part of the game just to make it easier for new players to join in the fun. CS:GO and League of Legends is an extremely challenging game yet you don't see their developers try and simplify their game to make it easier for newbies. Dumbing down the core part of the game just doesn't work.

Instead of focusing on your own mistakes and fixing what you did wrong, you'll simply blame an op weapon in the hands of a noob as the reason for your death. You'll never get better thinking like this everytime you die to someone.

And I don't understand why so many people think an op weapon in the hands of ""noob"" is dangerous when you have the same access to those weapons as well. In the hands of a professional reddit fortnite player you should be able to demolish noobs with all these op weapons. But seriously, it's an ugly attitude to have towards other players of the fortnite community when you yourself are probably just an average player as well. ",FortNiteBR

However, the most recent update changed how motion controls work to help handheld players. By doing this, they've made motion controls incredibly unintuitive for docked players. Rather than change it back to how it was before, hindering handheld players, let us CHOOSE between yaw and roll axis motion controls.

However, you can‚Äôt logically take mechanics from a PvE mode and expect them to work in a PvP mode. 

Gun battles in this game have very quickly become a dice roll between who gets the better bloom, and the more that we move away from the shotty meta into an SMG meta the more present this becomes. 

Gun fights should consist of pure aim, mind games, as well as building skill. The dice roll element of gun battles shouldn‚Äôt exist &amp; makes it unsatisfying to even attempt to improve your skill at aiming. Many of us like to see the skill cap increase and sadly its been decreasing more and more with every update. 

This isn‚Äôt the only thing that needs fixed obviously but I think it is a great fundamental push in a positive direction.

Obviously, the P90 is near unanimously looked upon as very overpowered and meta-breaking, at least people with objective critical thinking could come to that realization. It's being mentioned by streamers, both this and the competitive sub, even on social media and by word of mouth within various communities. Basically, it's occupying the spotlight of Fortnite v5.1. 

Due to this, many other infuriating issues that have existed before 5.1 and also amplified by it are being swept under the rug. This might include but is not limited to:

* Dominance of the existing SMG/Drum Gun Spam
* Dominance of Splode Spam
* Pump Shotgun is Useless
* ARs/Bursts/Pistols Rarely Viable
* Material Health Nerfs
* Material Harvesting Rate Nerfs
* Material Llama/Floor Loot Nerfs

And I'm sure there are many more. Now what if Epic consciously decided to add the P90, knowing full-well it would be absurdly broken, with the plan to respond to the expected backlash by nerfing it or outright removing it so the community can hail them as heroes who saved the game? All the while, all of these other issues are forgotten about and lose the attention they deserve as Epic claims they are ""listening"" to the community. 

As a side note, I'll be taking a break from Fortnite for the first time since January due to the recent changes Epic has made, the meta is simply indefensible. Despite this, I want the game to be fun again, it's my favorite/most played game since GTA V.

We're not able to spawn alone into the island, meaning the ""Don't Fill"" Button/Option isn't working, we always end up on a lobby with someone else but we can never see them on the map or on our team, there are indeed 4 teams available to chose from but the only way of interacting with these players is getting killed by / or kill them.

I'm getting the constant position and name on my screen of my friend, the person I queued with, even tho I've changed teams, and done all sorts of combinations to avoid this issue, kill or getting killed by him or vice versa, nothing seems to hide his name on my screen as if he was my teammate. Although the same does not occur with me on his screen, he does not know my location and has no indication of me whatsoever, just like its supposed to.

We use Playground to have fun (like everyone else), but not being alone, and constantly knowing his position makes the 1v1 situation unpleasant and overall useless really, its pointless hunting down someone when you know where he is all the time, not on the minimap, but his name above his head.

This has been the downfall of so many games. You should always balance the game around the most competitive part. 
1. These nerfs are allowing people who do not want to learn how to play the game properly by using all the mechanics like building to just dominate because they do not have to think or aim they just press their shoot button.
2. Building is why people love fortnite and along with other things is the main reason we still play this game so if I do a six layer ramp someone in a bush should not be able to shoot it with one rpg.
3. Mechanics that are heavily rng dependant like bloom or crit need to go, make this game more consistent.

The meta to me nowadays is simply just Spray 'n Pray. Which sucks. I get that Double pump was a bit too strong but atleast it took SOME skill where you had to land both shots and switch weapons and all that. Now you just spray wherever and hope you get lucky.. Building against this is damn near impossible, let alone in squads when everyones blasting their P90's at eachother. Not fun.

In my other post I've posted a clip where my brother literally gets sprayed THROUGH HIS RAMP?! Like this makes NO sense at all. Fortnite you're really losing me, man.

Everything they add to the game fails and gets taken out a day after, things that don't need buffing get buffed and others get nerfed for no reason. This game is honestly going downhill and I hate to see it happen.

-In the next battle pass there will be gun skins. How will this work? Basically when you pick up a gun it will change to the skin you have selected for that gun. 
-Salty Springs will be replaced with an ancient town, no name for it yet. 
-A New sniper will be released soon.
And finally there will be a new shotgun which will be rare and epic called the Double Barrel Shotgun which will have a wide spread.

‚Ä¢ The game has never encouraged rushing players as much as it has now. (Storm circle changes, edit peak changes, RIFTS!)

‚Ä¢ Explosives can easily be countered by building due to the lack of ammunition.

‚Ä¢ The peaking behind cover changes have made camping and spamming less of a problem.

‚Ä¢ Sub machine guns were not nearly being used or even mentioned as much as they are now.

‚Ä¢ You will continue to play the game because no other developers are as engaged in the community as Epic Games.

So I dropped Greasy grove, landed at burger and oh look! I got this Compact SMG from my first chest and it was a legendary rarity. I was so very stoked and indeed got a kill shortly after. The guy I killed had a Blue pump but I only took 9 dmg so I didnt pick it up, I tried it but it was so slow to pullout and the dmg didnt feel that great. No one else dropped Greasy and I looted my way to max shields but I didnt gather any materials even though my friends always tell me to, they feel useless to a new player like me becouse whats the point? I can destroy buildings VERY quickly with my legendary compact SMG! Anyways I made my way to end game by hiding in a house at Tilted Towers. Suddenly I heard footsteps in top 5 and  someone opened the door im standing behind. My hand was shaking but I got 2 headshots and a couple of bodyshots on the guy and he died instantly!  I looted him and make my way to the circle. Im camping in the back of a truck and realise its a 1v1. I decided to make my move and get out and I instantly spotted my opponent building stair in front of me facing the other way. I could barely aim becouse I was so nervous but I got 3 instant headshots on the last player and he didnt even realise what happened and then my screen went slowmo!

Each have a corner of the map where they have a storm shield defense generator that they have to defend while trying to take out the other teams‚Äô storm shield defense generator. Players can resapwn when they die, but lose all of their items. Once their generator is destroyed, they cannot respawn.

Instead of a timer for the storm, there would be a timer for different phases. When the timer ends for the phase, the next phase would begin.
 
First Phase - Storm Shield Generators are invulnerable and can‚Äôt take damage (that way teams have time to build bases and get supplies)

Second Phase - Storm Shield Generators are no longer invulnerable and teams can damage them by hitting it with their pickaxe. (Players can not damage their own generator).

Third Phase - Supply drops start dropping continuously in the middle of the map. Teams can then fight each other in the middle to get control of them. (Legendary items are only found in supply drops giving incentive for teams to fight for them).

Fourth Phase: Storm Shield Generators take double the damage.

(OPTIONAL) Fifth Phase: Each time a player dies on your team your Shield Generator takes damage OR Each team is given a certain amount of respawns before they can‚Äôt respawn anymore.

Gameplay Mechanics Options:

-Option One- No weapons are available on the map (besides supply drops) except for a variety of vending machines at each teams‚Äô base. Resources regenerate overtime so players can keep getting supplies.

-Option Two- Chests eventually regenerate as well as the resources so players can continue finding weapons.

I get that epic are adding smgs to make the game noob friendly so that these noobs might end up spending money on the game. But one of the most liked things about epic is the fact that they listen to the community. No one asked for a nerf to materials. No one asked for the recent change to build health. No one asked for a new SMG. We want shotguns to be viable. Remove the pump shotgun delay. Remove the p90 or nerf it. Nerf explosives. The building in this game is what makes it special. The smgs and explosives destroy structures so easy there's no point in building.

To make SMG's crazy good and reduce wall damage, does seem you are catering to lower skill players. I've been playing since last October, and shotguns are nothing like they use to be. With SMG's so powerful, shotties need to be reliable if you have an enemy missing SMG shots. AR's, it's been discussed for months and months. The bloom is outrageous at times.

I‚Äôm not here to complain I just feel as though they are updating their game into the ground with changes that aren‚Äôt in the patch notes and unnecessary changes overall. I‚Äôd like to know your thoughts about these changes and if you are enjoying the game as much as you used to and the reasons why or why not. 

Personally, I think the game was at its best before shotguns had the shooting delay but the smgs were still buffed I don‚Äôt quite know what patch that was but anyway that‚Äôs just my opinion. Once again what are your thoughts?

I still think Fortnite is one of the best current gen gaming experiences i‚Äôve ever had. BTW",FortNiteBR

Speak with your wallets.,"The game in it's current state is a joke. The extreme building nerf yesterday combined with the ridiculously overpowered P90 has created the worst version of Fortnite I've experienced in 8 months. I legitimately do not want to play one of my favorite games and it sucks. The only way to get the devs attention is to speak with your wallets.

Do not buy any in-game items until these changes are reverted.",FortNiteBR

I play about 10 games of literally people spamming my walls, throwing c4, and rocketing me. I don‚Äôt know what happened to this game but the 300$ I spent on skins and countless hours I spent getting good at building literally went to waste. I can‚Äôt enjoy one second because of the fact I know I‚Äôm gunna get spammed instead of built on. you made my favorite game into  a shit show of trash players ONLY holding mouse 1 and winning the fight. Wasn‚Äôt the motto ‚Äúthe build is the battle‚Äù. Rest In Peace this game I guess if I can‚Äôt evenly match my build skill with spammers no skill tactics I can‚Äôt play it anymore. Good luck to the other dedicated players in this 0 skill based game.",FortNiteBR

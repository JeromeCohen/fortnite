And regardless of what it turns out to be, Epic is changing games just by adding it. 

However, I do believe that it is the Chinese Space station. There is just too much proof. Astronauts, telescopes. The space station is supposed to hit in the Michigen area over the next 24 hours or so. Here I will post a link.

I will be bringing all of the information into one post.

Points of interest

[The comet](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88ciqg/comet_in_the_sky_confirmed_in_source_files/?st=JFGLPIH7&amp;sh=6d259bd7)

[Telescopes ](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/880znh/new_telescopeschests_above_fatal_fields/?st=JFGLZSTB&amp;sh=8121550d)

Controller vibrations.

Theories:

This is the original theory which stated tilted towers was going to get destroyed. [Tilted towers is going to get nuked](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/884wze/tilted_tower_will_be_nuked_soon_and_here_is_the/?st=JFGLLKT0&amp;sh=768d541f)

The controller vibration was first thought to be a bug but someone has converted the vibrations into Morse creating a very interesting and plausible theory.  [Vibration Morse ](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88i57r/controller_vibration_translated_to_morse_audio/?st=JFGLRKOQ&amp;sh=a1c3db6f)

However, a lot of people are still wondering if Epic is trolling or if the comet/meteor will actually collide on the land. I poked around in the files and found a mesh (Model) for when the comet will make impact ([Files](https://imgur.com/a/2qtnF))

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/8Vjj0) You will see what the comet looks like with the impact mesh. The texture I put on it is probably not correct but you get the idea. 

I highly doubt that epic would go this far for it to be nothing, it's happening!

Edit: The meteor/comet doesn’t necessarily have to be related to April Fools. April Fools can be something entirely different. The time frame for when it will hit can be from now till the end of the season. ~~However, the fact that there is an [egg](https://imgur.com/a/4mQQ6) inside the comet can also mean that it is coming today.~~ We’ll have to wait and see.

Edit 2: So it looks like this is going to happen later this month, meaning that there will be a few weekly updates before this happens, we will likely see new files added that tell us a little bit more. I predict that it happens during the week of April 16th.",FortNiteBR

What percentage of them get opened, I don't know.  However, in 1/3 Llamas, Epic should include The Weather Forecast.

What does it do?  Quite simply, it tells you where the 4th circle (which is pretty small) is going to end up.

So whoever finds this special Llama gets 500 brick, 500, wood, and 500 metal, plus the knowledge of where the 4th circle is going to end up.

Why should this be a thing?  The name of this game is called FORTnite.  It deserves to have some truly Epic bases built, destroyed, and danced on.  We want to see megabases built, not just a bunch of one by ones.  The game would be far more interesting if one in three or four games had people building crazy fortresses at the end.

I would recommend reading that first if you haven’t already but the OP discusses this 418 in the code
They believe that stands for 4/1/[201]8 or 4/1/18 aka tomorrow but i felt like that might be a stretch because updates arent usually on mondays and where did the 201 in 2018 go? 

I think its actually on the 18th of april and heres why. Updates for fortnite are generally on wednesdays and knowing that i looked at what day the 18th lays on. It happens to be a wednesday. From previous posts people have discussed the meteor being smaller last week. Slowly growing. At this rate it seems we should still have a few weeks to watch the meteor. My guess is on april 18th (4/18) the meteor will strike and that update will change the POI of tilted. 

Just a theory but let me know what you think!",FortNiteBR

One- When the match first starts, we glide down to where we want to go, or try to at least, but notice how everyone is going DOWN just like the meteor will.

Two- The map gets enclosed by a CIRCLE guys this whole thing was planned from the beginning, metors have a circular shape and the storm forms in a circle!1!

Three- When you hit the ground after jumping or falling, the controller vibrates (if you're on console) and you know what you would feel if you were next to a meteor as it hit Tilted? You guessed it dude, you would feel movement (vibrashons!!!1!1)

Get this, If you bought a ski country variant lets say the Canada variant which cost about 1500 vbucks, that means you have to spend 15-20 dollars ( Which is alot of money for a skin in my opinion ) And not only that but there are a total of 8 ski country variant skins which all look the SAME and if you want to buy all of them which are all lazy reskins, its going to cost a total of 12000 vbucks. Are you kidding me Epic ?? 12000 vbucks cost 80 dollars. Thats ridiculous !! 

Imagine if someone bought 1 ski country variant skin for 1500 vbucks, and he/she thinks that they will get all 8 which they should because they are LAZY RESKINS. 

And the worst thing was that they didnt even tell you that they were individual skins. 

These ski skins are going to come back im 100% sure or maybe a different kind of skin pack which is going to be the same level of greed as this one. 

I just found that out now on twitter, i saw someone complain about it and i thought he was overreacting. But when i saw how it really was i was Shocked. 
This makes me feel like EA didnt do anything wrong (They did though) but are you kidding me ?? Is everyone just going to let this slip ? 

They still havent learned from their first mistake which was puting a pay to win system in save the world. No wonder the base game sold terribly.  


I was soo close to buying the battle pass too. I felt like because the game is free and they keep updating the game, i wanted to be generous give back but after finding this out, Im just going to play this game for free.

   You're playing with your squad and another squad begins shooting at you guys. Like the decent players you are, you quickly build cover and start returning. Suddenly you hear one of your teammates shout in a panic. ""Guided missile!"", he says, before being sniped.
   You hear it before you see it, a blinking red weapon of destruction coming towards you. You quickly assess your options:
#1 **Shoot It Down**
   You take a small peek to shoot at the missile and instantly get hit with a head-shot by the squad in front of you, just waiting for you to do just that.

#2 **Build a wall**
   The guided missile is now closer so you build a wall and change positions hoping to evade it. But alas, this is not a real counter to the guided missile as it just goes up and over the wall ready to end your game. You get hit and the rest of your squad is wiped. You get to watch your killer hiding safely at the bottom of his squad's fort below.

Let's rewind shall we...

#3 **Build walls AND a roof**
   ""Turtle yourself in!"", you shout at your squad. ""It's the only way!"".
    You build walls around you and a roof above you, therefore making yourself unreachable from the missile. Your teammates do the same and you breathe a sigh of relief, only to realize the consequences of your actions. You've now put yourself in a position in which you are unable to shoot at the enemy and the enemy can now put **RELENTLESS** pressure on you. Right on cue, the goes on full-on fire mode. Your walls are destroyed faster than you can replace them and two of your squad-mates are knocked.
   The enemy is now pushing and you're running low on materials. You figure the only thing to do is edit out of your base and run. You build a door and walk out and sneak away, only to be killed by.... a guided missile. 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**CONCLUSION**

   I wrote this, because I kept getting frustrated by people saying guided missile is easy to counter. It's not impossible to counter, but it's very difficult to counter, especially in duo or solo matches.
   I really don't understand why a weapon that can go above walls, through holes, and around tight corners, has been introduced into a game where building cover is meant to be part of the gap between good players and bad players. More so because such a weapon wasn't even asked for by the majority of the community.
   This game plans to go e-sports and introduced this? Now when two players/squads are fighting the guided missile can interfere and catch them unawares. It is NOT good for the game and needs a SERIOUS nerf. And if you ask me, the best nerf would be to just take out of the game!
  Thanks for reading.

Edit:  Here is some info on the problem

I am on vacation and away from my PS4, but I have my laptop which I use to play once in awhile.   So when I bought the starter pack I figured I would buy it on the PS4 store on my laptop so I could get the vbucks on my PS4 account. When I went into fortnite on my laptop I did not see the skin in my locker

That's not what bothers me, so much as the opponents we have come across in every game have all been well coordinated, skillful players. Opponents accuracy, building speed/skill and teamwork have gone from being a mixed bag (some total potatoes, some awesome players) to just decent across the board. 

It is sure making for a challenge, but we have all agreed that it really feels like something has massively changed this week.

If you look very closely at the meteor you would see it is blue, rather than red, normally the meteor would be red due to crashing down and would cause alot of rubble coming off it. So maybe, just maybe, its a reflection.

I know what your thinking, a reflection, on a meteor? Are you serious? Yes, yes i am. When a meteor hits into satellites it can collide and sometimes, merge. What im proposing is that it merged and is heading for one area, loot lake.

I know what youre thinking, loot lake??? Well yes this is an april fools joke loot lake is a very useless and overpopulated area in the game and has next to no people. The impact would be much larger due to water and would create a cool flood around the area.

The game would be different with more water and would make things like impulse nades more useful. The center of loot lake could be replaced by a massive crater with little bits of water with a name like 'lost lake' due too its missing lake and could have a neat little area full of chests.

I had this idea after my friend wouldn't find an AR in the beginning of the game and I had only this green AR. So this idea came to my mind. 

Basically, ths concept allows you to 'fuse' weapons into the same weapon but in a higher tier. The UI will show you the 'upgraded' stats. And it also allows you to split a weapons (considering it's not the lowest tier) into the same weapon but a lower tier. It'll also result in more weapons which you could give to a friend in need.

Do people, especially in this sub, not realize that downvotes aren’t used to disagree with someones opinion? This is how you stifle discussion. 

Not gonna lie, it makes the majority of this sub come off as immature when people get down-voted for no reason. I’m sure people who have been on this sub for awhile have realized this as well.

I’m just wondering what you guys find so appealing about the downvote button.

You have a 50/50 chance to win a game of Fortnite. You will either die, or you won't. Using this idea, that means you have a 50% chance. Now, if there were a way to double your game, you would have a 100% chance of winning. But how do you do this? I thought for many hours before coming to a conclusion. It's a very simple answer. You play duos. You will have a 50% chance of winning the game, and so will your duo partner. Both of you combined, will have a 100% chance to win the Fortnite game. You guys can use this strategy as much as you want, but if you make a video on it please give me credit. Thanks.",FortNiteBR

I’d say I’m alright at the game, I’ve finished top 5 in solos a few times and have a few squad wins (ransoms that carried me lol), I’m still not sure on how the battle pass works etc but I’ll learn as I go along.

Anyway, my question is, how many v bucks should I buy if I’m aiming to get 1 nice, decent outfit (I don’t know, do outfits have varying costs? Say the most expensive one just for this purpose), a good pickaxe (again, highest one), a dance thing (like the flip or rocket ride one etc) and are back bling, gliders or the battle pass worth it too?

I’m not that fond of micro transactions and I’ve been told off before for spending my money on stupid stuff (even though I’ll be 18 soon lol) but since this game is free and the devs are actually in touch with fans, I can make an exception :P

It is where we go 75% of the time, and now I have gotten much better not just in Tilted, but when I play solos, or go other places. Tilted has 100% gotten me better at this game, with the repetition, the failures, and the ability to form strategy to win Tilted, and expand further into the circle and into the game. 

Was I upset earlier this year when it came in, honestly no I wasn't, my K/D took a hit sure, but the loot from game to game, and the wins that came with it were worth it. My friends and I had tons of fun, even when we got shit on, and like I said, now I have gotten better at the game, getting better with my engagements, and getting better with shotguns in particular. 

This isn't a ""get gud"" type of post, or calling people out for their age, but it is saying, if you don't like Tilted, don't go there, it is just that simple. Nothing is forcing you to go there. I am tired of hearing this nonsense about ""oh my K/D is only a five now, because I can only get 13 kills in a solo, where before TT, I got 24 kills in a solo match"". Stop. That isn't an argument point. This isn't Free-For-All in Call of Duty, where the guy with the most kills wins the game, this is Fortnite, where the last man / team standing wins. Kills aren't everything, winning is everything. 

Think about it, when you talk to people about Fortnite, what do they ask you about, kills or wins. If you answered wins, you are correct, if you answered kills, you are a liar, and lying to yourself, because the answer is wins. 

You can have a 10 K/D, and lose to a guy with no kills and no weapons, because he waited out the storm, and medded up in it. That is what makes this game so fun, the unpredictability of it and the random nature of each match making the game so pure, and why the game is so popular, because literally ANYONE can win a game. Skill and K/D doesn't matter all the time. 

If you can't hang in Tilted, that is fine, it is not a sin, not everyone can do it. There are fifteen other named towns, and many other smaller locations you can go to as well. Lonely has a max of 12 chests, it has great loot, so does Retail and Pleasant. Fortnite has a great balance I feel in towns, that depend on your play style and skill. Tilted is for experienced players, where some of the unnamed areas, and places like Moisty and Tomato are for the weaker, younger players. 

Hopefully if you progress in a good way, you could start going to Tomato, Moisty, Lonely, Wailing, Anarchy, those types of easy places, then upgrade to your Dusty, Retail, Lucky, Salty areas, then start going to Pleasant and Tilted. No person in their first game on Fortnite should be surprised and / or angry if they go to Tilted, and get annihilated in five seconds. 

But to hang on some dumb conspiracy theory about Tilted being taken out or blown up, and following the vibrations and translating them into morse code, is so benign. Tilted has been being ""taken out"" every other minute, for two months now. It is getting old. People need to stop complaining, and just move on with life. 

Tilted made the game great again, and totally refreshed it. We used to go to Lonely every single game, gets tons of loot, get a few kills, build a great fort, and win many games, but now with Titled, we go to Lodge a lot, but we always are sending it to Towers, seven-ten times a night, and are still grabbing 3-5 wins a night. 

I hope they do a new map update soon to add another type of Tilted to the game, because there is a lot of empty space near Anarchy, that could use a good town or two. 

And like I said, if they remove Tilted, I think it will do more harm than good, and some of my friends will stop playing the game as frequently as we do, and I think that rings true not just for my friend group and squad, but for many others as well. It could be the thing that puts a sour taste in a lot of Fortnite players mouths. ",FortNiteBR

Still pretty new to the game, and i've been watching some older videos on tips for beginner vs advanced building. 

The videos so far have suggested going into a regular solo playlist and dropping in a less populated area to pick up some mats to start practicing. 

Two issues:
1) Isn't that against TOS? To effectively not ""play"" in the sense of focusing on eliminating others? Will I get in trouble for doing this?

2) I see there is a custom matchmaking option, but couldn't get it to work properly by myself. Is there something I'm doing wrong?

u/niccorazi-_-, u/GeneralErica and me (u/Tactical_Peperoni) just discovered something very interesting concerning our last theory (https://redd.it/884wze).
Epic Games bought a studio called “People Can Fly” (a reference to the movie Kalifornia) which was soon to be called “Epic Games Poland” in 2007; this very studio was founded in Poland. And here comes the crux: one of the founders of this studio is named Andrzej Poznanski. Sounds familiar, right? Furthermore, this very founder of “People Can Fly” started a new studio in 2012 called “The Astronauts” after cutting ties with Epic Games. 
This might all be a hommage to Epic Games Poland/People Can Fly and it's founders new studio, “The Astronauts”. The meteorite might crash down on Poznan to either hommage them or symbolize their break-up (Poznan(ski) being wiped from the map).
Stay tuned, fellas and keep your tinfoil hats on at all times!

What I discovered is that the controller actually does two types of vibration, a light vibration which is subtle and lasts for a second, whilst there's a harder vibration which lasts for 1.5 seconds.

The following four patterns were discovered:

&gt; ... --- ...

&gt; -..

&gt; .....

&gt; ....- .---- ---..

It intrigued me as to why there were three different vibration patterns, it turns out there's actually a logical reason as to why there is and what triggers this pattern.

The first pattern is what occurs when it's daytime in the game, the second pattern is what occur when it's night, the third pattern is what occurs when you're in the storm and the fourth pattern is when you're gliding down the map

Together the patterns make up the following:

&gt; ... --- ... / -.. / ..... / ....- .---- ---..

When this is translated into morse code, it translates to the following:

&gt; SOS D 5 418 

So what does this mean? Well, SOS is a commonly used distress signal in morse code which translates to save our souls. It seems that there is a distress signal from somewhere on the map.

After thinking for a few minutes, I tried to figure out what the D5 meant, I then decided to cross reference the map and it turns out that D5 is the grid which Tilted Towers is located in. Meaning that this distress signal is coming directly from Tiled Towers, they're broadcasting to the map asking for assistance. 

The next part of the code, ""418"" was easy, it's a date 04/01/2018. 1st of April 2018. 

So essentially this is a broadcast dated tomorrow in where Tilted Towers is asking for our help. This goes in line with the meteor theory, that Tilted Towers is going to be struck and destroyed, supported by the telescopes and battle pass emotes.

But yeah, this is a pretty crazy discovery. Let me know what you guys think.

This is not the direction the game intended to go. And if the dev's wanted it to go this way then there needs to be a counter.

Fortnite is a unique game. It is a game in witch you TDM your way to mid game, then break out your sandbox skills to survive until late game, and all the while maintaining your shooter skills to last you the rest of the game. Two of the most influential aspects of the game that separate the elite from the average is building and tactical rushing.

Being able to build quickly and efficiently can turn you from the defensive to the offensive real quick. When you walk out in the open, the second best scenario is for you to take one body shot. (the first being the shooter misses you) This gives you time to build an adequate fort for you to med up if needed and prepare for a fire fight. Also, your building skills can counter another's building skills in the middle of a fire fight. For example, if someone is building up efficiently, you could be able to continuously block them off and position yourself for an optimal position to fight. The next key element of the game is one we see in the all-mighty Ninja's game-play... rushing. If you are confident with your building AND your shooting skills, being able to rush is SUPER key. You can spot out any enemy's position and confidently take an angle of pursuit towards them. They could be high or low, it doesn't matter. Being able to run up on an enemy and use the element of surprise gives you the upper hand. They could be all cozy in their base while you build above them and drop down spraying all sorts of hell on their health bar. Or they could be in the middle of a fight while you add some extra pressure on them while taking them out. Regardless, building and properly rushing puts you ahead in this game.

So what slows this down? Guided missiles. Guided missiles give the user full control in which the explosive goes. They can go up, down, left right, and even at tight corners! They add an element of fear into players that hasn't been seen before. They are the ultimate counter to the game. It gives a player a huuuuuuggge upper hand in the game. Why? I'll tell you why.

Let's say you and a duo partner make it to the last 4 or three teams alive. You've played the game by the books--you've watched ninja so you know exactly what to do. You and your partner are taking a stealthy angle of pursuit towards another team. Along the way, you decide to start building towards them. From the distance, you hear something... a guided missile. There are two ways to act against this. Either build before the missile comes to you, blocking it off from harming you and a partner. Or shoot the missile before it hits you and your partner. But it could be hard to locate the missile during it's first course towards you. And that could be all it takes! That damage could take you and your partner down. Or maybe you luckily build in time, successfully blocking any damage. But this is late game. Chances are they have a lot of rockets to spare. They have the ultimate upper hand. They are hidden away from your knowledge and they know exactly where you are.

The guided missile doesn't even have to act as a weapon. It can be used to thirst a team of its resources all the while they figure out where the missile is coming from. That being said, it can also be used as a UAV! A team could be tucked away somewhere out of sight and send a missile finding other players. This gives them an advantage like no other. They themselves can be out of sight but still see others. ""But you can shoot the missile out."" Of course you can, but like I said, you don't need to use it for damage. Using it for damage is just the OP plus of the weapon. A duo team using a missile is broken. One uses the missile to flush out the enemy while the other teammate hunts them. Or maybe if they have the ultimate element of surprise, the team rocket rides the player into the enemy without knowing. The combination of uses for this weapon is too plentiful and too overwhelming for what this game was made for. And if the dev's wanted to push the game in this direction, then they need to add counter play. I don't know how, but they do. Add a cooldown between uses; weaken the missile head to less shots; shorten the time of usage; weaken the damage; introduce special ammo for the guided missile; or maybe add a jammer item to the game that directly counters guided missiles.

My point is, don't take out the fun idea of guided missiles. My point rather is to balance it out so it doesn't infringe on the parameters that define the game we fell in love with. And if the developers what to change the meta in which the game is played, then keep adding little things that change small aspects of the game over time. Keep us interested, and don't peeve us!

But of everything they have added to the game, I really feel like the guided rocket is absolutely unnecessary and a gimmick to get more streamer clips. What does it add to the game? It’s already hard enough to win a game when people are spamming RPGs or grenade launchers at you, but at least you can counter those by moving since they can’t move with you. I understand the ‘counters’ to the guided are to shoot it down, build, or shoot the person controlling it. But in situations where you’re the last person in the duo/ squad or in solo squads trying to clutch out a dub, shooting it down leaves you just as vulnerable and exposed as the person shooting it, building just allows the other people to push you while you’re distracted, and again, trying to shoot the person controlling leaves you equally exposed as him. Unfortunately I think the days of being able to win out-manned encounters in the final circle are long gone if they have a guided missile. My main concern is that Epic is getting too extra with fortnite, I’m afraid of the Cod Advanced War-ification of the game; i don’t want to see it fail/ burn out. The allure of Battle Royale is dropping in, grabbing weapons, and the thrill of survival. I’m afraid additions like the guided missile take the game away from those roots and make it more gimmicky/ Cod- like. Anyways, if you read all of this I appreciate you lol

It has to be the stupidest thing I’ve ever seen in a game. I don’t know how anyone can defend it besides players that can’t aim at all and feel like they stand a chance. Go ahead and leave a comment trying to defend it below and make a fool of yourself.

Sticks to the outside of the storm, will avoid combat whenever possible, never has any mats or ammo.  
*Counter*  
Ignore completely, they will naturally die to the storm/kill each other off/die to real players.  In solo, these usually make up 7 of the last 10 players.  
  
**Rust Lord**  
Expert shotgun head clicker, prefers to engage only in suprise or pinch attacks, will typically build a non-reinforced ramp and attempt to jump on top of you.  When hit, will typically retreat into your building and place traps everywhere.  
*Counter*  
Engage at distance, AR preferrably, they usually can't actually fight outside of pump/tac.  
Build up, they're typically not good builders.  When you see their ramp line coming, block it off and reset yourself.  
  
**Builderboye**  
Commonly purchases the John Wick skin after their first win with IRL cash.  Will land far from threat of combat and farm everything in sight.  Builds giant fortresses upon initiation of combat.  Prefers to RPG and SCAR from the top of their forts.  
*Counter*  
Explosives, plain and simple.  RPG &gt; Nade launcher, if I don't have either of these I try to carry a blue/purple SMG for tearing through buildings.  If you try to engage them in a building fight it will likely last awhile and get you pinched, either rush them full on (beware of traps) or go straight for their building foundation.  
  
**twitch.tv ______**  
Typically skilled in most areas and aggressive.  This player hot drops, full loots, and then tries to find combat for their loots.  They move around constantly and watch all angles.  
*Counter*  
Any of the above players.  twitchybois are typically skilled in all areas, but not experts.  They can be outbuilt, outshotgunned, etc.  If they happen to be more skilled in those areas, there isn't a counter.  That's the game.   
Also, luck.  If he lands on a revolver and you land on a pump, he prolly ded.  
Disclaimer - am twitchyboi, probably biased.

Epic please fix your motherfucking game, stupid twats.

PUBG is better in every way, this game requires no skill and is full of little kiddies taking their mom's credit cards.

Fucking shit overrated game. Just becuase it is a free , no skill and works on mac/console it becomes number one game in world.

I really am curious as to how such a successful game was changed for the worst. If something isn't broken, and is as successful as it was, why change it? This new meta of shooting someones build instead of using skill to build up to them edit and shoot them is horrible. It essentially is just another attempt at decreasing the skill gap so everyone is able to just hold the trigger on someones build. I thought this was FORTnite, not shootnite. Noone should be able to sit at the bottom of what i build shooting it the whole time till i die while the bullets go through the build.

The low building health and smg meta is horrible, and also the shotgun pullout time is horrible. The whole reason a pullout time for the shotgun was added was to eliminate double pumping, if double pumping is now gone, why is there still such a pullout time for the pump? It's horrible.

Please for the love of god just make the game good again. Building should be effective, smg's should be good but balanced, and pumps should also be good but balanced.",FortNiteBR

I recommend going from Risky, through Wailing, Lonely, and Retail. 
You could also go from lucky, through fatal, salty, and dusty.

2. Search 3 supply drops

50v50 is a really easy way to do this

3. 3 SMG Eliminations

It’s easy as pointing and clicking, just make sure you hit

4. Follow the treasure map found in pleasant park

Land on the closest hill to the southeast of tilted, there you will find your battle star

5. Deal damage to structures with remote explosives

Again. 50v50

6. Search 7 chests in Lucky Landing

There’s really no explanation on what to do here

7. Get 3 Eliminations in Lazy Links

I recommend getting this challenge done as early as possible, because you will have the max amount of people going there first. You could attempt to do this and the SMG challenge in tandem, but be wary.

Won 3, and came second once, and it's honestly the most boring LTM I've ever played. You can win from not much more than map knowledge. Just find an unpopulated route where you know where all the chests are, open them, collect some coins, and win. Port-a-rifts make it even easier. If someone finds and attacks you, just rift lol, and go collect some more coins, and win. And games tend to end in the most boring way possible. The games I won I had a lead of 500+ points, and the game I came second in I think I was 700 points behind the winner. Nothing exciting, either way. Nobody attacked me, I just collected a coin or opened a supply drop and won.

So, it's pretty broken. But remember Infinity Gauntlet mode? Remember how Thanos' location was shown on the map so any player can show up and kill them if they dare? Remember how exciting that made that LTM?

Epic can fix this Score Royale. How? Simple. Iif you're in first place (or maybe top 3?) in terms of score, your location goes up on the map for everyone to see, so people can come and get you, and stop you from getting to 2,000 points and winning. That's going to create exciting fights, exciting chases, and exciting end games.

You should reduce cooldown of pump equip to 0.6 / 0.5s. Everyone waiting for Double Pump comeback.  


For that person that may argue with ""They added new ""double pump"" recently - Double Barrel Shotgun"" ► Yeah its good, but its not double pump. For me who play from First week of BR release I want some skill-based game.   


You are creating game for kids. For those who want tryhard this beloved game, you should add some mod for example - OLDSCHOOL MOD - Old map - Old Double Pump etc.

First in the patch several updates ago where we can no longer crouch to cancel an emote to stop turbo harvesting was added, the no-skin then figured out a separate way of turbo harvesting, using custom binds and jumping instead of crouching.

Today's patch, has now locked us emoting, where we cannot crouch to cancel an emote, or jump to cancel an emote.

Instead of locking emotes to counter the actions of one twitch streamer who ruined it here's a solution to the issue:

Add a cap to how often the harvesting tool can be swung per second or per tick (unsure on the numbers).

An example of this can be seen with Overwatch, with one of the newer heroes added Brigitte. When she was first added into the PTR (public test region, sort of a area where new content is added to be tested by the community and balanced) and she had an animation exploit, pulling out her shield after attacking to 'cancel' the attack animation, and able to then put away her shield and attack straight away increasing her attack speed, DPS (and healing) by 10-20% if you were able to learn the timing and rhythm effectively. Here's a video for your understanding if you don't play Overwatch, or didn't play during the PTR:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDcw0eKVB5w

You can see the difference in the attack speed during 00:05 - 00:09 (normal attack speed) compared to the other parts of the video

Blizzard shortly after a day or two later rolled out an update to the PTR rendering the animation cancel useless, where it would not 'reset' her attack animation, instead would be put on a delay until the next 'attack' animation can be started - You could still pull out your shield and do everything normally, just you wouldn't be able to refresh the animation and quickly do another attack, but would wait until the next attack was ready compared to the normal attack animation.

So it comes to this, is it **that** difficult to add a cap to the harvesting, making it so you cannot swing the harvesting tool faster than intended, rather than figuring out a new way to stop the no-skin streamer when he figures out a new animation cancel to turbo harvest?

Thank you for your time in reading, I hope someone at Epic sees this and is able to implement it, we need our old in/out emoting mechanics back.",FortNiteBR

This change was intentionally made months ago at the request of the players. Why is it being changed again.

This doesn't help us at all. It just makes things confusing. The best solution is to have damage dealt appear as it does in something like Battlefield. where it is a HUD element. as it stands right now, damage dealt can be blocked by in-game objects, which has always been weird to me. They should take visual priority. There should never be a case where I damage someone and can't see the damage I dealt because they're behind a wall.

Show the damage dealt next to the reticle or maybe where the mats farmed appears. That way it's never a guessing game. With this new change, you can hit someone who has 30 shield for 120 but it will show as a big blue 130. You have no way of knowing how much shield or health they have now. This has big impacts on engagements. With the old system, I'd get a blue 30 and the rest would appear as health damage. I may not know exactly how much health they have but I know for a fact I broke shield and I know exactly how much damage I did to their health.

We were both getting stomped early on every single game, and it was getting kind of frustrating. Contrary to  our bad luck today, we usually do decent enough. 

Before I continue I want to add that 1. My friends and I play on Console, Xbox to be specific 2. I have no shame in admitting that out of my group of friends I’m probably the worst at this game (not to say I’m garbage, I like to think I’m around average for a console player.) and 3. I’ve had the game since pre-season one because I initially bought it for StW, and BR was just a bonus.

Anyways, one game in particular towards the end of our games today struck me as a little peculiar. As had been the theme of the day, my friend and I died almost immediately. The odd part came when one of the people who had killed us invited me to their party. I joined to see what they wanted, and they basically went on about how I’m trash and I must’ve bought my account because there’s no way someone who has Renegade Raider can be as bad as me. I simply explained to them that I didn’t buy my  account, and that I simply was a mediocre player who happened to have been around for awhile.

It was at this point they kicked me from the party. However, my friend had also joined the party and told me that right after they kicked me one of them sarcastically said “Yeah right.”

I just don’t understand why people think skin = skill, or time played = skill. Should I be better at the game considering how long I’ve had it? Maybe, but Fortnite isn’t the only game I play. Not everyone who is an “OG” player is on the same level as the pros.

TL:DR - Me and a friend of mine had a string of bad games today. One game in particular the person who killed me said I was to trash to have Remegade Raider and I must’ve bought my account. The level of toxicity was honestly shocking.",FortNiteBR

There's nothing like a nice long fight and coming away victorious.  Honestly even losing those battles at least it feels like a fair fight.

&amp;#x200B;

What I hate is when I get done with a fight and a third party shows up as the clean up crew to get an easy kill after they did nothing to earn it but be in the right place at the right time.  I understand there are plenty of great players out there who's skill is the ability to read the right map rotation so they are always out-positioning their opponents.  I am confident, that these players are few and far between.  

&amp;#x200B;

With increased mobility this season due to ATKs, rifts, etc, less skilled players are able to get the third party drop on you more frequently.  Their skill rarely comes into play, they're just benefiting from a fast map.  I believe I have a solution for this:

  

The re-deploy glider mechanic in Soaring 50s should be STANDARD in all FN modes. This will nearly eliminate 3rd partying in two ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. during a build battle, the third party will not be able to shoot down the combatants.

&amp;#x200B;

2. after a battle is complete, winner can build up to prevent getting third partied. If a third party arrives, winner either retains high ground or glides away from either being shot down or on own accord

&amp;#x200B;

Personally, I expect a lot of people to come in here and downvote and tell me to get better at the game.  Having played the game since launch, I have seen it evolve into something amazing, and now slowly but surely devolve into a mess of a great game.  Please read through these suggestions with an open mind.  I'm sure there are some gaps in my suggestion, so please point them out and maybe we can reach a community resolution here.  

&amp;#x200B;

I hope in the end, the only downvotes come from those who only get their kills by third partying.

The gliding mechanic allows you to survive even after asshole teammates knocks down your structures. Not only that, it also removes the long winded walks from one side of the map to the other. I've even noticed a much more evenly matched battle during the end game for some reason. The chaos that occurs in those last few minutes are *amazing.* It is an absolute warzone! I find myself laughing out loud just due to the sheer absurdity of people drifting in ATK's, all the while several players fly across the screen to go from mountain to mountain. It is a beautiful thing. I'm excited to see what you come up with next, EPIC.

Personally, I think we will be seeing some kind of clown/party themed skin to go along with the balloon axe, since the cruiser glider was released in the battle pass before Shade and Maverick hit the shop.

I’ve also seen the idea of golfer/caddy based skins to match lazy links and the golf ball toys.  But since Moniker is shown to be that area’s skin I find it more likely that there will be some kind of desert/paradise palms sort of outfit.  Maybe some sort of real estate agent?

The Road Trip skin is a toss up for me.  My best idea would be something else from history to fit the whole worlds collide theme.  It’ll probs be more like ragnarok than drift, since omega and the visitor have a bit more in common than the visitor and carbide.

Any other predictions?  Nothings too crazy, epic has been pretty random with skins this season.

My suggestion is to have a single pay option to cycle through a certain number of skins once they're released. 

&amp;#x200B;

For instance, instead of paying 2000 V-bucks to permanently have one skin that will no longer be new in one week, a player could pay 2000 V-bucks to essentially ""rent"" several skins, i.e. they get the newest skin in the shop until the next new skin comes out, at which point the old skin is replaced with the new one. Epic could charge different amounts based off of how many skins will be cycled through, e.g. 2000 V-bucks to cycle through the next 4 new skins, 4000 V-bucks to cycle through the next 10, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

While a player has a certain skin, perhaps they could be offered a reduced price to add the skin to their locker permanently instead of giving it up when the next skin comes out. 

&amp;#x200B;

This seems to be a win-win. People who don't want the commitment of being stuck with a bad skin would be much more willing to actually buy a skin permanently. And even if they didn't, Epic has still made profit where it wouldn't have before. ",FortNiteBR

But as with all things ninja if he thinks something is cool everyone will start using it, making this galaxy skin appear not so cool or rare.

This is the same thing with drift, very good skin and I love it but now that everybody in the game has it, it's not so cool or unique anymore.

To counteract all the hate from iPhone users, just add an equally good apple exclusive skin.

Maybe an apple head or to go with the whole space theme just add a solar or lunar skin.

We NEED tap to edit implemented ASAP. When yo need to hold down a button to edit it both kills time and puts the player at a disadvantage when fighting in a fast paced build battle.
2. We need to have different sensitivities when shooting and when building. I like to have my sensitivity slower when shooting for accuracy and then higher when building. This would give us a chance to build as fast as pc players
3. We need keybinds or something to rotate stairs and other builds quickly.
4. We need auto reset rotation button: There are so many times when I rotate my stairs and next time I pull them out they are backwards. 

Pleas epic implement these so we are not always at a competitive disadvantage when building against PC players. Thanks for reading and hopefully we can get these soon ",FortNiteBR

I was up late on night and bored so i decided to see how much Ragnarok was actually worth. Here is how i did it.

So first thing first i had to find out how much Xp on average you gain a match and how long a standard Fortnite match is, so after like a half an hour of research I came to the conclusion that you get about 600 Xp per match and a match lasts around 20 minutes. Here is where it got hard. Now I had to find what number of matches gave you the closest number to 100,000 Xp without going under. Now after a while I found that the closest to 100,000 I could get was 100,200, The equation which was used 600\*167. now how to find how long that would take was simple all you have to do is multiple 20 by 167 which gives you 3,340 minutes. In order to convert that into hours all i had to do was divide by 60 which tells you it takes...56 hours. Finally I multiplied 56 by the minimum wage which were i live is 9.25 dollars which gives us a total of 518 dollars. I just think that's insane for a skin. Comment if you know a skin more expensive and explain how.",FortNiteBR

As a player who lives in India, the ping is terrible here. I get 180 ping in most of my matches. Sometimes the ping bumps up to 300 and it’s literally unplayable. 

I always have to play In either Eu servers or Asian servers and the enemy always has the upper hand. The shots take more time to register, building is slower, there is a ton of lag and minor glitches which happen frequently. 

In the leak a Server in Mumbai was supposed to be introduced. Is it happening or did they scrap the idea? It’s not just us people who live in India who experience this. Players in the Middle East and players in south east Asia are in the same situation. 

If epic could hurry up and release the servers it would be great. We can have smooth gameplay and performance resulting more people actually playing the game. 

And yes if anyone is wondering there are a lot of Indians who play the game. They just weren’t motivated to continue due to the bad performance they experienced when they first hopped on. 

As an avid gamer like me I dedicate at least an hour daily. I have supported the game by buying virtual currency worth over $500. 

If the new server gets implemented it can benefit all of us.

But when I started playing there was no builder pro, they kept changing the sens, and there was no news on the controller mapping at that time.

So as I felt diminished, I bought a M+KB for myself. Did pretty well. But now they changed the matchmaking and I only get top players on my lobbies; and let me tell you guys why.

I still get controller players on my lobbies, but only the good ones. Everyone in my lobby KNOWS how to play. First of all I thought I was not playing well, but now after days of testing I know that's not the case. They changed my matchmaking by win rate, K/D or whatever.

First of all every serious game has a casual and ranked style of gaming, Fortnite is the only exception. By making a casual experience as serious as that, the game simply looses it's fun. And hey, you ask, why don't you just go back to the controller?

I was not given the option. I tried play on a controller altogether and it didn't worked. Same lobbies. Tried to be honest from the beginning, and now, I have no ability in a controller anymore, and even if I did, I spent a lot of money on a decent M+KB, which I could have spent on a scuff controller for myself; and trained that way.

I thought Epic was going to be at least honest and transparent in their changes to the game. Not a word was said about this change. And I waited.

I get they want to listen to the everyone's cries, and is trying to promote their game, but dude, that is not good business.

I'm not asking for to be put in lobbies with controller players while I use M+KB. I just want as much as a casual and fair experience as I can get.

The game is supposed to be fun for me, which isn't anymore. I work my ass off and don't get a lot of time to play.

Of all the bad changes that was the worst.

Since this is basically my first reddit post, I can't really post outside links or ""advertise"" but it's free and I made it for the Fortnite community so I don't really care:

    gosamosa.com 

The idea is that a person creates a ""lobby"" on 'gosamosa'. Everyone goes to the website and joins that lobby. The host clicks ""start countdown"" and that count down is synced with a world clock and pushed to everyone's browsers. When it reaches 0.00, they time that click with the ""READY"" button in fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

[example usage on multiple devices\/browsers\/IPs](https://i.redd.it/we5stmgd1nh11.png)

That's the basic app -&gt; providing an extremely easy-to-use synchronized countdown.

Optionally, after everyone arrives on the Fortnite Lobby Island in-game, people in gosamosa lobby can provide an ""identifier"" (last 3 letters of the Fortnite Lobby ID at the top left of the screen, usually) and their name/nickname/whatever. This will create a visible, dynamically updating table of who is where so they can decide whether to leave the match in favor of getting a better stacked lobby.

&amp;#x200B;

[After the countdown is finished, you can broadcast where you ended up.](https://i.redd.it/b0pvgxlg1nh11.gif)

But the app is generic enough that it can be used for a similar purpose in any game... or any where you want to sync an event with lots of people.

I've tested it out on different devices, browsers, networks at the same time and have had fairly good results but if you find anything that is broken or could otherwise be enhanced, let me know!",FortNiteBR

I really don’t understand the hate behind K&amp;M on console, yes I understand it has an edge over controller players, but if it was really a problem why don’t you controller players plug in a K&amp;M and learn it? 

Unfortunately my PC broke and I was stuck with only my PS4. Fortnite &amp; Sony both support the input and thus make it available on the console and therefore I’m going to use it. It isn’t treason against the queen. It’s simply my preference and nothing is wrong with that.

For me, it’s not about getting an advantage over controller players, it’s about me using the input I enjoy and feel comfortable with. Nothings stopping you from picking up a cheap K&amp;M and learning it. I did in fact play controller for a couple months and I can tell you for sure, switching to K&amp;M was the only thing that made me continue playing this game as it allowed me to get even better as a player and actually replicate things I watch online and stuff I used to be amused by but could never do on controller e.g. fast editing.

My main point here, is that I believe people are being stubborn over K&amp;M. I feel like the majority of people crying about it are the ones that have tried K&amp;M and sucked bad at it and went straight back to controller with not motivation to even try K&amp;M. And before anyone starts commenting stuff like “controller and K&amp;M shouldn’t be in the same lobby end of”, I agree to an extent. I personally wouldn’t mind a divide in players based on input, because I’ve played both platforms and generally speaking, the majority of PC players are a lot worse than console/controller players, so it’s no loss in my book.

Boy they sure don't know how to improve their game and think adding stupid things like this will help - when it wont. Why does Epic cater to new players so much? It blows my fucking mind. Right now Epic should focus on Quality of Life changes especially on consonle as its atrocious compared to the smoothness of PC. For example i have to hold how a button for 1 second just to edit a structure and sometimes it doesn't edit at all or will edit a different structure when i'm clearly aiming at a certain one. I'm getting tired of this shit Epic i really am. I currently still play the game a lot with my friends and have fun but they just seem to do the most stupid things. Eventually a new game will come a long where they don't cater to new players but to experienced ones who know how the game mechanics and game works in general so it can be improved.

\-------------------------

**Lastly**, what is the point I'm trying to make? We are encouraged to keep Epic accountable, and this is the time to do it. Many of the aforementioned features have been talked about, mentioned to be in development, or additional information on the topic would follow shortly; but have not been mentioned since. Ultimately, it is up to Epic to decide what to do with the game, but holding Epic accountable is all we can do to show them we care.

It's either Pump/Heavy+Smg or Tac shotgun for every close quarters fight, the pump/heavy and smg in my opinion is too powerful for the little skill you need to use it and the tac is quite unreliable because of RNG spread.

&amp;#x200B;

I think epic should remove the shotgun delay and let people use multiple shotguns again, it takes skill to use and you lose an inventory slot that otherwise could have been healing or another weapon.

First off, we need a poll system in game for the WHOLE community to have an influence on patches not just these reddit warriors who die and come to complain instead of learning how to play the game.

Stop lowering the skill gap. The point of any game is to increase your skill to get to the top. I understand giving newer players a fighting chance but by making a spray meta/nerfing buildings and mats and catering solely to lower skilled players does nothing but punish the better players. If you want to help out the lower skilled players why not introduce a matchmaking system based on amount of matches played or total wins. (Win percentage and k/d wouldn’t be effective in this due to placing players together based on these would decrease these stats each game). Or introduce some tutorials for newer players as most don’t watch videos on a game before they have a joy for it. Another good idea would be instead of an overall matchmaking system is that players under100 or 50 matches played will be matched together to give them all a fighting chance to learn and win before having to go against higher skilled players and even provide a message at the end of the first x matches letting them know they are about to enter much harder games 

Balance everything BEFORE adding more items and STOP buffing items to shortly nerf them to a worse state than the original state making them an irrelevant item. 

Give incentive for players to continue playing after tier 100. Season 4 we were granted with the final upgrade for omega. This was a great reward and although I thought the challenge would remain for following seasons for those that didn’t receive if the first go around (still thought would remain reaching lvl 80) I was glad to find out it was only for that season. It gave a good reward for those that actually grinded like crazy and could show it. Due to players crying on reddit they changed it to overall xp challenge that continues from season to season so other than the game itself, after hitting tier 100 players have no need to continue playing til the next season as they will still get the reward, also me and a lot of my friends are level 80+ or very close and all shall receive tier 100 within a week or so. 

There are many other big games being released in next few months and most are trying to include their own battle Royale which will steal a lot of fortnites player base if issues aren’t resolved or players don’t have a reason to continue playing. 
And last thing I’d like to rant bout is the talk about mats being rumored to have a 500 stack limit over the last month or so. And how players complain about the building mechanic. Building is the one thing that makes this game different from all other battle Royales and nerfing the hell out of this mechanic will do nothing but cause players to wish to stop playing. 

I do understand epic wishes to drag new players into the game and due to this wind up catering to new players but if you lose the OGs or avid players in order to gain new players then the player base will slowly die out 

It is 5:30 am and I’ve had to come back to this a few times to continue my thoughts so if this is a little jumbled or doesn’t make the most sense then sorry for the long read 😂",FortNiteBR

The season 5 battle pass is definitely worth it (just like the rest of them) you get skins, emotes, sprays and even the vbucks you paid however it’s not as good as the previous seasons. I personally find the skins very simple except drift and ragnorock (idk how to spell his name), sun strider is dope but I feel like shes missing something.  
The backblings are decent but  it confuses me how the best backbling imo is available for no skins. I’m talking about the unicorn backbling, and trust me I’m  not salty.  I love to see more items offered to defaults .

I also noticed how most of the skins in this battle pass are a part of a set that is not fully available in the battle pass, of course it isn’t a problem but if you look at season 4, we had a full set to collect (zoey) that includes the skin, glider, backbling and pickaxe.

Lastly is the sprays, these are absolutely the worst. I do like a few of them but I find most of them are useless. The previous season offered better sprays and more colourful stickers. What are your thoughts? ",FortNiteBR

imo we need

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1: RPGs removed from ground (Because you can spawn in a house and die in one shot to a projectile impossible to do anything about, because building is not viable in early house combat, and if someone lands at your house and gets a rpg, you're just out of luck. 

2: Increase shield/Chug jug droprate, would really help

3: Buff the minigun and semi auto, make semi auto come with more ammo, and make miniguns recoil smaller. Maybe people would want to go for airdrops if half the time you wouldn't get something you don't care for.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The reason this is even a problem is that airdrops encourage fighting! And in a Battle Royale game, the option for fast paced combat can always prevent you from being bored, and somebody lucky with 1 kill shouldn't be the reason someone has a better gun then someone that is looking for action and has many more, and it'd encourage wins by SKILL and not LUCK,

I feel like I'm improving, but ever so slowly that it just isn't enjoyable. I don't even feel decent at it. The minute I feel like I improve I get curb-stomped by some wannabe-Ninja which sucks any of the fun out of the game and learned nothing from that encounter because everything zoomed by so fast. 

There *needs* to be a change to the matchmaking of the game so that new players actually feel like they can improve. Not everyone learns how to get better by being thrown in with top players. Some learn by beating people of similar skill level and moving upwards *slowly*. 

To put it simply: **I just can't ""git gud"" at this game**. This is the first game I've played that I cannot see myself playing because the learning curve is just way too damn steep for new players. The current system is like trying to teach someone logarithmic functions before learning basic addition and subtraction and telling them to ""figure it out"".",FortNiteBR

Maybe epic could make it so that for seasons that you purchased the battle pass in but didnt complete, you could still purchase tiers for their respective vbuck prices and with the new drift and ragnarock tiers they could make it so that omega and carbide could be leveled up after the seasons over as well, just a thought that i figured might be nice, what do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

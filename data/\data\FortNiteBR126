For example, once a month, Epic could release a small questionnaire/vote for what should be focused on for the next update.  An example could be:

&amp;#x200B;

Pick which of the three should be implemented next patch:

1. Unvault Bouncers with improvements added
2. Nerf \_\_\_\_ 
3. QoL adjustments to Turbo Building

Which Mobility Vehicle is your least favourite:

1. planes
2. golf carts
3. quadcrasher
4. etc
5. etc

What Weapon Concept would you like to see?

1. Akimbo smg
2. Burst/Automatic/Single fire Toggle gun
3. Weapon Attachments

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, these polls wouldn't even have to be deciding factors on their decisions.  Some of the winning polls can be implemented, some may never be implemented,  But the idea would be to see what the general consensus is among players so that they aren't surprised.  It still boggles my mind that they thought they'd be able to add a SHINGing weapon into without any major disliking from the community.  Obviously if something among these polls gets a 90% liking rate, then adding them into the game will be a better idea than something with a very even 50/50 split (like re-deploy) or something like 20% (like half of the new releases)",FortNiteBR

Do I need to use the specific skin to get the cosmetic upgrades? So playing with the Lynx skin only unlocks those upgrades and then playing with Zenith to unlock his upgrades? Does using either skin unlock the upgrades for the other? I am wondering because I have not gotten the Battle Pass before.

Thanks",FortNiteBR

5,Ultra_236,1546443243,abuehh,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/abuehh/idea_season/,1,(Idea) “Season ?”,My idea is that for two weeks after the end of a battle pass (only happens rarely) there will be an event called “season ?” Where old battle passes will return but in order to continue you must of owned it and reached halfway. You can continue the previous one for free but for each battle pass before that either 100 or 50 vbucks is added to continue. There will be weekly challanges still to allow quicker progression. The reason you need to be half way is to keep the rare/og skins still moderately rare. Also the background on the lobby would be the cube event world (the place where the butterfly is).,FortNiteBR

After 30-40 people die, then all the grey weapons on the floor turn to their green rarity, same as the weapons in your inventory. After another 20 people, they turn blue.

By the last 10 or so people, all weapons are gold. If there’s an item that doesn’t have a leveled up rarity, then it gets replaced by its respective upgrade, i.e. blue burst to purple burst, blue AR to purple scar, etc.

I think it’d be a good mode that rewards people for staying alive. Or even if they do a skill based mode where you start off with gold, end up with grey. ",FortNiteBR

I think you were given 20/20/30 materials and like 200 ammo max (dependant on the weapon). I seen a lot of hate towards it however me and my friends really enjoyed it, and i genuinely think it should be a permanent mode. 

The way in which the game is played is completely different. It relied on using natural cover and good positioning to gain an advantage over your opponents, it was less about pushing every team you see and more about securing high ground in the next zone and defending it and being able to use trees and out buildings during your rotations for cover (planes were also very uncommon, i think maybe 2 or 3 spawned per game). It had a couple of disadvantages, explosive weapons like quad launchers were extremely overpowered.

Your probably thinking that i am just a bot that doesn't know how to build, however i am a good builder and the building mechanics of the game are probably what sets fortnite ahead of its competitors in the battle royale gaming scene, and i really enjoy that aspect, however i found this mode really fun.

I know that this is a bit of a controversial post but I also believe that it is a topic at least worth discussing. I'm not sure of any better way of conveying this idea than doing basically a question/answer format with questions I've asked myself and also questions that anyone else has. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Would I be able to buy previous Battle Passes and complete them?**

No, only BP's you have purchases already you can complete.

&amp;#x200B;

**How would advancing previous passes work? Would the old challenges come back?**

The old challenges would not come back as much of the game has changed and many old challenges are just no doable any more. You would advance the old pass with 'overflow stars' that are earned after you've reached tier 100 on the current BP. So instead of the daily and weekly challenges offering extra XP after no more stars can be earned for your current BP, you would continue to earn those stars for the incomplete passes you have.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if I have more than one incomplete BP? Which pass would the stars go to?**

I have a couple of ideas on how this would work. One being that you can choose which pass you want the overflow stars to go to. The other possibility would be having the stars go directly to the first pass you purchased then working your way through the seasons again. (ex. if season 2 and 4 were not complete then stars would go to season 2 BP until it's complete then automatically start filling season 4's BP)

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I opt-out of completing a previous pass so I can earn the sweet, sweet XP for those new BP skins?**

I think that this question would go hand in hand with the choices listed in the question above this. If the first option is in play, then yes, because you have a choice of which BP you're putting stars to (or none and just get the XP) but if the second option of working your way through the BP's in order is the on being used, then no, I think that you should have to work through all of your old passes to gain the extra XP rewards. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What happens when the season changes and a new BP is released?**

You work on that season's BP until it's finished then you can continue to work on the old BP that you were finishing.

&amp;#x200B;

**Can I purchase tiers for that season's BP like I can in the current BP?**

Sure, why not? Of course only after you've finished the current one.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about the old awards of ""10% Personal XP Bonus"" and ""5% Friend XP Bonus""? Will it be possible for me to end up with 300% personal XP bonus?**

No, these would be turned into 1000 XP and 500 XP that is rewarded instead of the multipliers. 

&amp;#x200B;

**What about the free tiers? Does that mean that everyone has access to at least the free tiers?**

No only people that payed for the BP can go back and finish old BP's.

&amp;#x200B;

**Wouldn't this make the people who grinded out those seasons mad?**

Maybe... maybe not. but I think that it would make a lot of people happy as well. Personally I know of a few people that are currently too busy with life at the moment (mostly people in school studying for exams and stuff) that would love to get some of the BP skins even if it meant grinding extra hard once their time is a bit freed up.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall this is just a suggestion and I'm curious as to what everyone thinks, I just want to create an interesting discussion. I'll answer questions in the comments and post them in the list so they aren't asked again. ",FortNiteBR

What can I do?,"I have been playing this game since season two. I’ve logged around 900 hours, the majority of them solo, but plenty of duo and squads as well. But as the game has progressed, I continue to die earlier, get less kills and become more and more frustrated with the game. There was a time in seasons 2-4 where I felt I was pretty solid as a player, understood building, aim was average, and I would go on win streaks of 2 or 3 games and nothing made me happier than playing. But as the game has continued to develop, I feel helpless. There are times when I lose a fight and I say “well there’s nothing I could have done, that player was just too good.” I have done everything I can think of to improve my skill, forcing myself into hitter drop zones, pushing to get more kills, doing practice/warmup courses to help improve building and aim, and most recently changing my controller button binds to help with aim/edits. Every time I try to add something new to my game (for example new controller binds) I feel like my skill improves for a day or two, and after that I am right back to where I was, often dying before rotating out of my initial drop location. So my question is what can I do? I am at a point where I get on with high hopes of doing well, and often get off after 3 or 4 games (usually more) because I am frustrated with my performance. How can I best attempt to shorten the skill gap between myself and better players? I haven’t won a solo game in around 2 months and am close to just no longer playing the game. Any suggestions are welcome. Thank you. 

TL:DR: I used to be a solid player, but as game has progressed and players have improved I can’t manage to win anymore. What can I do to fix this? ",FortNiteBR

Planes
Planes are a funny way to move across the map, however, I think they need to be nerfed a little bit. Changes that could be made to the planes:
- when a plane explodes, the player just dies
- add fuel to the planes. By adding this players won’t be able to fly around in planes the entire game.
- add ammo to the turret. 
- reduce the spawnrate of the planes so not that many players would be able to fly around in a plane. Planes should be a rare vehicle, not something with like 20 of them in the game. Take a look at pleasant park for example, since the addition of planes pleasant park is full of people flying in planes and killing everyone which is very annoying.

Baloons
Only one thing I think needs to be changed to baloons and that’s the spawnrate. We don’t want more baloons than shotguns in the game.

Quadlauncher
Quadlauncher should simply be removed. It’s a very annoying weapon. It’s a very overpowered weapon since it can shoot 4 rockets very fast. This just doesn’t belong in the game. There are already too many explosive weapons in the game.


Boombox
I’m not saying the boombox should be vaulted immediately. It’s a new addition to the game and you never know, maybe it can turn out to a fun item. However, I think the boombox needs some changes to make it a less overpowered weapon. 
-reduce the ratio of the boombox
-reduce the duration of the boombox

I think that we can all agree that battle passes should be season exclusive. Epic shouldn’t be letting us get more tiers after seasons end, or rerelease skins from old battle passes.

HOWEVER, I think that many people who grinded the free battle pass in any earlier season should get the chance to upgrade their battle pass after that season has ended. For example, people who manage to complete the entire free pass of a certain battle pass clearly put in tons of work and time into the game, so it makes sense that they would be able to get the battle pass rewards from that earlier season up to the tier they ended on. Of course, the tiers would be locked after the seasons end, but I think for dedicated players who simply don’t have/didn’t have money for skins, there should be an option to upgrade past battle passes.

Feel free to disagree in the comments, I would love feedback or criticism uwu.",FortNiteBR

I really want to congratulate the people at epic who have made this fortnight the best one I've had all year. I was even looking forward to playing, and doing challenges after beginning to lose the love I once had for this game, via the constant adding of items we don't need, and the unnecessary nerfing and vaulting of stuff everyone loved. The ltms were so damn creative, and I had such a damn blast! I don't see why we can't have this much fun in a game every week. I really hope that epic takes this into consideration, because I feel I'm not the only one feeling down that we won't be able to have this much of a blast for who knows how long. Like how damn amazing was this team that added stuff that was beyond what we had thought they were capable of?

Then they added the clinger, Super buff to C4, guided missiles, quad launchers, quad crashers, stormwings (airplanes), the buff to all explosives, the OP infinity blade, and now the BoomBox. From a business perspective, it makes a lot of sense equating out playing field to encourage more new players. But they have now over 200 million players. It makes sense to attract new people but what about the 20 million that play? Most of the people I know an have seen on Reddit don't like this new ""Epic"". Evan, the pro's don't like it because they are mostly known for the building and edits. If the pros don't like it there followers will also not be happy. It makes no sense why they are trying to attract new players when they have a big enough family already?

These kids are what I like to call sweaties. These people in my opinion are becoming an issue in the game, here is why and how to spot one.

How to spot a sweaty

- They are likely wearing an OG skin from Seasons 1-3 or a Default with some kind of cool looking back bling.

- They will usually build after you hit one shot on them.

-If they are console, they likely mash their ZL button while shooting to abuse their aim assist

Why they are a problem

- These are the people starting the whole get good ""advice"" in Fortnite, while these are the people hindering player growth.

- These are people usually who have toxic and overall immature ways of speaking to others and are usually the people who say ""You're bad kid"" whenever they die.

- There is nothing wrong with them being good at the game, but it makes it hard for others to win since there is such a vast majority of sweaties on this game.

- These people also think that Epic should patch whatever they think needs patching because they are an almighty god 
EX: Ninja

- They throw a hissy fit whenever they lose and make others incredibly uncomfortable or they break something. They don't do it always, but when they think the kill was ""trash"" they will throw a fit

The heavy shotgun is still really good, but with the new pump, nobody is really using them.

I say vault them both and create a single slug firing shotgun. It could have the same fire rate and range of the heavy. Because it’s one single slug, the shotgun will be very consistent damage wise. Give it a 2x headshot multiplier. 

Variants: common (60 damage), rare (64 damage), epic (68 damage), legendary (72 damage) 

One of the biggest issues and complaints with the shotguns are their damage inconsistencies due to bullet spread. I’d make this gun not as hard hitting as the pump, make it a reliable gun that you can trust. No more hitting people for 20 damage with the tac. ",FortNiteBR

I first played Fortnite Save the World, and I liked it. In January 2018 then, when some friends started playing it, I played Battle Royale with them. I liked that game. Not many tryhards were there, not too many updates in short time, and so on. 

But then Fortnite reached the first peak of its Hype. Many new players came, which was a good thing, because you could play with more people, stuff like that. From time to time some LTMs came in. High Explosive, Solid Gold, and all the other original ones. Then, 50v50 v1 came out. It was a whole new feeling, not many people liked it though. With the map changes, some new areas came, like Dusty Divot, and they looked cool.

Then came the time, where new content every two weeks was usual. I liked it, cause new things are always good, right? Then new updates every week were usual. Events took place, something completely new in Fortnite.

But then everything changed. Every week there was one update, every two weeks came new items. Stuff came out, a week later, it was vaulted. Kevin came as an event, and it ended up being just a ""new"" location. 

And that's what I don't like about Fortnite Battle Royale:
1. It's a gamemode full of tryhards, that just wanna win and don't care about the fun at the game.
2. The community behaves absolutely asocial. Besides those people here on Reddit, they seem to completely ruin the fun at the game.
3. With new content every week, the meta changes all the time. Good items that were fun like the Tommy Gun get removed, and useless items like the Boombox get added. It almost seems like Epic Games isn't trying anymore.

In the other mode players had to defend an objective by building defenses around it. That idea seemed pretty cool for a PvP game so they tried it, and their building mechanic did not turn out how it should’ve been.

Usually within their trailers you see forts built and players defending the fort from other players attacking. Instead the game is not defensive, and most of the time it is offensive. Instead of building a fort, you have to go find someone and go quad ramp rush them. After all, the game is called FORTnite, not Buildnite.

Now I never said the current way building is used is terrible, I just wanted to shed some light and my thoughts. Maybe the reason for all these items/changes is them trying to somehow bring back the Fort in Fortnite. ",FortNiteBR

I know I will not be familiar here since I’m literally a nobody and none of you here are on my friendlist or vice versa. But I am part of Fortnite BR, and needless to say, I am proud to be part of it. I have been playing since season 2 back in December of last year. I still have no single win in any normal games and all of my victories are only on LTMs. My first battlepass was on season 4 and my final one was last season. I have no need to buy a battlepass at this point. In fact I have no reason to even play anymore. I just fell out of love for the game. As of this writing I currently uninstalled the game but will keep the Epic launcher installed since it has great potential as a gaming storefront. I have bade my time with this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it despite so many misgivings in the last 6 seasons that I played. I now can move on with my new life and my new career this 2019. No more worrying about challenges for the week and how to beat them in record time. No more alt-tab moments where I have to look at the challenge quest map markers provided by guide gurus here in this sub. No more contesting for chests, points, markers, vehicles, or weapons. No more amazing emotes to activate during emote challenges or when I win an LTM or when I was just feeling happy that moment. No more wearing of sazzy skins, battlepass or otherwise. No more moments where I still am trying to learn how to snipe while building my own sniping tower. No more happy moment with rando squadmates where we just roam around the map and take advantage the new features added every season. No more subreddit to go to when a new update drops and I join in the praises when it’s fun and join in the rants when it’s literally broken. No more new experiences I might encounter for seasons to come. No more. 

Needless to say it feels like I’m letting go of something really important to me and something that makes me happy. In a sense you are all right, I am. But like a child accepting the fate of their grandparents that they will not live for long, I know I have to learn to let go. But before I go I would like to thank this game, this community, and everything about it. I would like to thank Epic games, first and foremost, for making the BR mode free and making us all experience a gaming phenomenon that has reached a scale that has never before seen. We only asked for minor tweaks last year and you ended up giving us the world. I would like to thank the community as well, especially /u/thesquatingdog for all your helpful guides for us all this time. I also would like to thank the very few friends I had in this game, but most of them quit or are not in this sub, but I would like to thank them anyway for helping me when I was still a noob. This will probably be my last entry in this sub. It’s been a wild right everyone. Thank you and have a blessed 2019. More power to you all and Fortnite BR.

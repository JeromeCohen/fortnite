The audio paired with such a terribly small FOV makes me feel like I seriously have no idea where people are sometimes. I can't tell where gliders are or are going what so ever, footsteps might as well be someone clinking pots and pans around my head and having me guessing wtf is going on and wall replaces are sometimes still entirely silent.

Well, if you haven’t noticed, the John Wick LTM does not have ballers. I assume this is because they don’t think there is a need for quick mobility, as well as it would ruin the game if in the end circle, with time ticking down, John wick was just evading with a baller. And I totally agree!

It blows my mind that in an LTM, they had the correct forward thinking to remove ballers, seeing that it might impair the quality of the LTM or make it less fun in the least. 

So why the hell have we had ballers for so long? People thought originally it was to be a fun addition to the game for causal players, but an LTM is pretty exclusively casual players. So why?

I just don’t understand why they would wait to add it, which makes me question if it’s really coming back. Why would they leave their game in a bad state on purpose for a few weeks when they are already ready and planning to fix it? 

Right now, Epic has 2 shotguns that fit a brute force spammy playstyle, and no shotguns that fit a playstyle for using building and positioning to be able to sneak quick little shots at people while they’re exposed. I think the game would be much more balanced with shotguns to fit either playstyle. A low damage + fast fire rate shotgun, and a high damage +lower fore rate shotgun.

- Three lives (Reduces the potential of fuck shit happening with your one life in regular BR)
- 70 player lobby (Reduces lag to some degree because of this, this enables it to be squad which offers much more options/strats than duo or solos)
- Has an active objective (Shows where the three leaders are on the map so you can make plays for the lead instead of just camping and winning with one kill)
- Has mats/ammo per kill (Enables you to make plays after coming out of big fight/enables you take to take more fights.)

Why? Because that's how the game is played. The maps aren't very large, most fights are mid-range, and aiming and reaction time are very important. The AK is one of the only ARs that can  one-shot anyone, helmeted or not. This, combined with CS's heavy aim importance, make the AK an obvious choice. Valve knows this and embrace it. The AK has become synonymous with CS.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now compare this to Fortnite. The pump shotgun accounted to %26 of all kills. In Fortnite, the majority of fights are close range, building is used to close gaps between players, the pump outclassed the other shotgun, and medium to long range fights rely on bloom. This makes the pump the obvious choice competitively. With Epic vaulting the pump they showed that they don't have any respect for how their own game is played. CS has been played professionally for 20 years because of its high-skilled gameplay and having devs who actually appreciate the competitive scene (except for that revolver thing that one time). If fortnite continues this trend of hating competitive play, (which has been going on for a very long time mind you) then it's competitive scene won't be around for much longer.",FortniteCompetitive

The Combat shotgun is good but the problem is the headshot damage isn’t rewarded enough. The New tactical Ar is a laser but whats the point of a laser if it tickles a person for 6 seconds straight to actually kill them. I had a few bloom battles from all ranges with a friend using a Scar and Tac Ar and the scar won at every range. Doesn’t make sense since the Tac Ar is supposed to be good Close/medium quarters but still gets outclassed by a normal Ar that shines at Medium/Long range. 

The thing that doesn’t make sense is why there are weapons like the Boom Bow and the rpg that reward missing and do massive damage. You can hit the floor by someone with the bow from 200 meters away and do minimum 115 damage while if you hit a clean headshot with the Combat which is pretty difficult you do only 125/137 damage.

Recently the L2 and MKB debate has turned into more of a meme but there are almost daily complaints, blamings, and toxicity surrounding the subject. The argument is that L2 is way too overpowered and should be nerfed. The counter argument from Controller players is that it is necessary, which I agree with to some extent. However constant L2 spam is not something healthy for the game. Then controller players raise the argument that they cannot build or edit as fast as PC players so they need L2 spam to keep up. This is where the argument is flawed, L2 spam requires no skill at all, however editing and building at high speeds needs tons of practice. Also, there are tons of controller players that can edit and build extremely well at levels right on par with PC. This whole controversy can easily be settled if a simple timer was put on Aim Assist to something like .75 seconds. This would allow controller players to line up their shots with some help but then have to track very accurately, just like you do on MKB.",FortniteCompetitive

I used to run a much higher sensitivity, but my edits and builds are much more smooth and consistent, and since I've realised on console the game really isn't kind to you if you run a really high sensitivity as it makes FPS drops and freezes seem so much worse when they happen as you are moving/turning really quickly while building.

This is of course assuming they’re allowing any mouse, but that would be pretty interesting since so many players who have qualified, and pros in general, use a finalmouse. 

It also calls in to question whether or not you could use aftermarket mouse feet/paracords or if you should just practice with your mouse completely stock.

But fuck, making the game outright not enjoyable for a number of people is asinine. There have been multiple decisions that make the game less enjoyable but removing the pump is in its own category.

I've played the game without stretch res and siphon. I've played the game with the tommy gun, boom bow, heavy sniper, and quad launcher. Adjusting to these decisions made the game less enjoyable, but it was still fun (after developing a tolerance). **I've never played this game without the pump** and now that it is gone, it is outright not enjoyable for me. It was a staple to this game and was removed to match Epic's preference of how they want the game played; not for balancing reasons. **There was a reason it was in the game for 8 seasons with very minimal complaints/adjustments.** 

You could argue that the pump made the game not enjoyable for casuals, but that was by their choice to not improve at the game. I have no choice in this matter except to get over it. It is not the same as adjusting to native or no siphon in pubs. There are no similar alternatives to something that was the saving grace of this game.

I get it: ""If you don't enjoy the game then quit and Epic is a business."" That doesn't change that it fucking sucks. This is the only game I've played for a year and a half.

At least epic revealed their thinking about ballers ""*provide fun and exciting mobility""* and I can appreciate that, but it also revealed how little they understand what a baller is in the game. I haven't seen it spelt out anywhere either but I'm not a regular reddit user so I might have missed it. To the benefit of all I do some translating of why ballers ruin any game of FNBR (comp or pubs) and at the end suggest some real nerfs for ballers.

&amp;#x200B;

What is a baller in FNBR:

1. it is the most effective mobility item in the game by a lot (fun and exciting doesn't matter for winning).
2. It grants an insane amount of extra shield to the user. Epic just reduced that amount from 4 big pots to 3 big pots. Big deal, not a real change at all, any rational player will take any extra shield and 3 big pots is huge! No one will pass that by. Hell, players will wear a bush to get protection against a single shot, which admittedly can be huge if it is a heavy sniper shot.
3. Oh yes, a baller is also a bush. Even with health reduced to 150, which a single heavy sniper shot will break, the baller rider only loses his mobility item but takes no damage just like when wearing a bush.
4. A baller can be combined with a bush! Double heavy sniper protection, who doesn't want that.
5. Having a baller makes you a member of team baller which allows you to do things in world cup qualifiers that would get you banned for teaming if not using a baller.  Have you watched bizzle's stream last weekend? You see him and another baller player hanging out in a 1x1 for an extended period of time not attacking each other. I'm not trying to get bizzle banned, just providing a high profile example of the point I'm making. Happens all the time, multiple ballers crowding into tight spaces without attacking each other. If both players were doing the same without ballers the ban hammer would certainly strike. But using a baller, Epic has granted you permission to team. Yes it is teaming by design, Epic even provides effective in game communication (visual only but that is enough), ""*you are in a baller, I'm in a baller, we understand each other*"", no need to swing pickaxes at each other. And yes it happens even in pubs. To me that is the most infuriating aspect of ballers, teaming designed into the game. It makes it infuriating to watch and play against. With planes players had to make a choice not to attack each other, with ballers it is designed into the game.
6. You can attack other players builds without risk. Any other weapon you have to risk being shot at, but not with ballers.
7. Any drawbacks: not really. Being in a baller is all upsides and no downsides.

So how do you fix it? I'm not going to pretend I have a solution besides the obvious one to vault that shitty piece. But to go at it systematically, what is missing with the baller is any real downside or risk that balances all the upsides, which hopefully I made clear go way beyond just super effective mobility. Any real nerf also has to remove the ability for ballers to hang out in close proximity to each other without impunity. So here we go with  possible real baller nerfs:

1. If you can't take damage while in a baller ( there shouldn't be any mobility that does that) at least make the baller rider take damage on destruction of the baller. If that was the case, the baller player at least has to make a choice when being shot at, between abandoning his baller prematurely or risk taking damage. Make that damage severe enough, like 100hp, and using a baller becomes a much more double edge sword than the one sided affair it is now.
2. Baller on baller collisions should insta destroy both ballers. That should go some way to mitigate baller teaming in late game moving circles and together with player damage on baller destruction (previous point) allows for a lot more creative ways to counter ballers besides boogey bombs. Impulse grenades anyone? 1000iq baller on baller collison play with exit at the last second. I can see the highlight vods now but I won't hold my breath that this will have the desired effect in comps (remember planes).
3. You loose your bush when entering a baller. Minor, but you shouldn't be able to double bush.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR1: Ballers are so powerful (and break fair gameplay) that reducing baller health is at best a cosmetic nerf around the edges. Real nerfs need to include risk for the baller player to offset the enormous upsides.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR2: Great that epic communicated their thinking about ballers. But it is scary how shallow that thinking is, apparently no one with power over gameplay decisions plays FNBR or listens to FNBR players. ""*defensive agency"",* wtf?",FortniteCompetitive

What I'm getting at is I think it's very easy to misjudge a console player's skill solely by looking at their stats because the console lobbies are EZ if you're an above average player.

I know stats aren't the only determinant of skill ;)  

Personally, I would like it if they could separate console players stats between matches played in Console vs PC lobbies.

Here I will write things about what I alredy know or about my playstyle so you don't have to waste your time asking:

Loadout: 

Slot 1: Sniper or Boom Bow, if I can't find one of them I use RPGs, GLs or even scoped and normal ARs.

Slot 2: Combat Shotgun, if I can't find one I use Double Pistols or Tac Shotgun.

Slot 3: Dum Gun, if I can't find I use the P90.

Slot 4: Shadow Bombs, Stink Bombs or Rift-to-go, if I can't find them I pick a 2nd healing item (majority of time is Big Shields).

Slot 5: Healing item, always Mini Shields or Bandages.

Playstyle: 

- I play passively.

- I only enter a fight if necessary.

- I am always rotating.

But the way epic has directed this game is terrible, to the point were it's not even for the casuals but it's so RNG, luck and non-skill based so that a 3 year old could probably get a kill in a lucky game. 

&amp;#x200B;

One way I see epic improving Fortnite is to almost negate weapon RNG at the start of the game. The way I believe this could be done is by removing ammo and maybe mats as floor spawns. This could make it  so people get a gun AND have decent mats/ammo after their first house. Is implementing a feature were you start the game off with ammo and mats. So depending on the game mode (Solo, duo, squad) you would get maybe 2 stacks of ammo and 2 stacks of wood, so that in a solo game you would spawn in with:

&amp;#x200B;

20 Medium ammo, 36 Small ammo, 12 Heavy ammo, 8 shotty shells and 60 wood. But no rockets (Because if you're doing 4 person squads and someone gets an RPG or GL and everyone gives them rockets they would have 10 rockets which isn't good for competitive integrity). Then remove ammo and mats as floor loot.

&amp;#x200B;

Too many times I've seen someone cucked by running through a house finding a bunch of ammo and then dying to someone who got a shotgun off their first loot spawn. Even worse one of my friends was going through his WC finals replays a couple of weeks ago (Not sure which week?) and realized in not 1 but 2 of his games he went into his drop house and only found ammo/mats. If he got a gun and killed the people who killed him in those games and got 3 more points he would've won some money.

 We should not be stuck in this box of having the only real competitive fortnite being in a BR. I don't think the BR aspect of fortnite is what makes it so great. I think its the building aspect. 

If you have ever played Zone Wars than you know what i am about to suggest. If you haven't played Zone Wars tahn you really should. Its pretty fun, anyways..

We need to have a competitive mode of a highly polished and ranked Zone Wars with maybe as much as 20 people, a variety of maps, predetermined load outs and 500/500/500 Mats. Im so sick of this bullshit RNG. Its not actually competitive. What i am suggesting is real competitive.

Everyone's always complaining about something new every week, stretch res, the pump, ballers, etc. and never take the time to enjoy the real factors of being able to play a game which is available to the public for free and ability to play with friends on different gaming systems.

I understand the frustration of player who are good at Fortnite and get very good at something just so Epic could take that thing away from them and they need to learn to adapt again. You are selfish. There's a large team of hard workers who literally grind day and night to make sure that the majority of players don't lose interest in a game they are unable to play since there is a large skill gap.

Of course there's going to be bugs and weapons that aren't fair to you in a game but Epic watches and works on all of that all the time. You have to stop letting a free game get to you in a sense where you're left upset and frustrated because the game isn't how *you* want it to be. Think about Fortnite politically, as a minority you lose every time in a democracy. They give you competitive game modes with prizes what more do you want, imagine being a bot who plays the game for fun and having no chance in a lobby with sweats, a new player likes the idea of change and being able to use fun vehicles/weapons, and taking all that away from them just so you can maintain your skill advantage?

When it comes to bugs and development issues coding is not an easy job, if any of you have any experience in the field you know its tiring and hard on a deadline. Fixing issues in a game isn't a finger snap it's hard, not almost as hard and consistently making new models and recreating the game every 4 months (but it's somewhere close).

I understand the topics of competitive mode issues and wanted the game to be suitable to you and fun for you being a good player, but a good player is a player who can adapt to any types of changes.

Just wanted to bring what (I think) is a relatively fresh take on the pump vaulting topic. Ever since the pump was vaulted, my mechanical skills have suffered. I haven’t been consistently rotating my stairs or drawing the correct edits on my walls. 

This is most likely, in my opinion, because in a close quarters 1v1 fights, the only thing that gave you a sense of urgency/need for speed in your editing and mechanics was the risk of being pumped hard if you left an angle open. Now, it feels like my skill is regressing to season 2-4 level, where I’m just moving around with my shotgun/smg trying to out-spam my opponent. Skill no longer wins, and it’s incredibly disheartening to think that all the practice I put into this game for the last year has been thrown out the window so a player who didn’t put in the time might stand a better chance. 

All I’ve been enjoying playing for the last few days has been creative or playground, and only in islands where pumps are available.  In playground fill, nearly every person, no matter the age or skill level, has been saying how they prefer the pump over the new shotgun options. Epic games created something great with how the pump functions, especially insofar as how it affects the overall meta of the game (building, editing, peeking, positioning, etc.) and they’re throwing it out the window. 

I’d be happy if they brought back just the green pumps to pubs. Hell, even a grey version that does 85 body/170 head. Just please, don’t remove this mechanic that so many of us have practiced to learn and grown to love. 

TLDR; the pump vault has sent rippling effects through the overall meta and player skill as a whole will suffer because of it. 

u/MrPopoTFS u/EpicLoomin u/JustMooney1 u/FreightTrainUSA u/DanDaDaDanDan please read this and try to understand this small part of what the pump vault is causing. I didn’t even begin to touch on the issue of competitive integrity/how vaulting the pump in arena mode mid tournament is unfair and inconsistent with epic’s promises, or how the pump vault has recreated the season 5 spray meta that is not fun to play or spectate.",FortniteCompetitive

They added it for advertisement, obviously. Try to make everybody happy and then nobody is happy. They give competitive players stuff and their main player base is less interested. They give their main player base stuff and competitive players protest. There is no winning for them. Their competitive base mocks the competitive format constantly and takes everything very seriously. That is clearly, from the choices and additions that they have made, not what they want. They should have never committed to competitive if they can't separate pubs and competitive without everybody getting mad.
The fortnite world cup doesn't bring them much money clearly, and the best way for them to gain players is by getting streamers and pros to have fun and draw more players. They can't do this if they don't like the game. It is unfair to the majority of players if they cave to what Competitive players want all the time. When people started begging for a Ranked mode, what did they do? They added a Ranked mode. When people wanted siphon, what did they do? They added siphon. 
Then they took siphon out of pubs because it was making it harder for most players and taking out a necessary skill/rng compensation from the game. Then players get mad. They remove the pump because gameplay was getting stale, players get mad.

However, in a truly competitive game, where your load-out is more or less determined by RNG, there should not be a one-shot-kill weapon. Although there are many instances where it requires great skill to hit a perfect headshot, there are an equal number of instances where a player happens to randomly run into another and hits a lucky shot. If you want fortnite to be truly competitive, it should require more than 1 shot to eliminate another player.

I’ve read a million posts about L2 spam being broken in the past and a few recent posts regarding how broken it is in season 9 with the clear spray meta in place. Here are my thoughts:

KBM players have such a huge advantage in a close-range spray battle because controller players cannot spam L2 while someone is jumping around close to them (think of the amount that players are moving on your screen when they are close vs when they are far). On top of that, L2 spamming makes you basically stand still, making it easier to track your movements.
This is a point many KBM players refuse to believe or even have an open mind about from what I’ve read

However I think that at mid-range, console players have an advantage because L2 spam is most broken at this range. The ability to snap to a players body or head over and over again is very abused and OP.

Suggestions:

- Remove aim assist while spraying through builds (you can’t even see the enemy, why be able to lock onto them?)

- Have distance accounted for in aim assist effectiveness 

I shouldn’t be able to instantly lock to an enemy 300m away flying through the air, but currently close range L2 spam in a spraying box fight is also honestly trash against someone who is moving a lot. 


Tldr: The further someone is, the less effective your aim assist should be and vice versa",FortniteCompetitive

Run a combat shotgun, with Tommy or AR, Utility/heavy snipe/explosive, mobility utility, and heals. I’ve seen most success with this loadout throughout games in champs division and qualifiers. 

So what I’m seeing is that the biggest complaint everyone has is the removal of the pump. As someone who has player since early season 2, I understand the sadness of losing such a core weapon, but I don’t feel it’s as game changing as some say it is. 

The dynamics of close combat used to be shoot a pump, then switch to secondary, smg/ar/tommy, something in that regards to spray the enemy down to push forward the highest dps possible. Either that or selective pump shots from lowground, highground, or edit peeks. The difference now is that there is almost a penalty when switching to a secondary spray after shooting with the combat shotgun, but the core mechanics of selective shots remain the same, and in fact, I feel the combat shotgun is more rewarding than even the pump used to be throughout the game. Obviously you can’t just shoot and switch, the delay (which I believe should be removed) makes it counterproductive to even try to switch after a combat shotgun shot. Just keep shooting, while tracking the enemy’s head.

 Me personally as a very aggressive end game player, it fits my playstyle graciously. I understand getting used to the mechanical differences in combat gameplay, but it really feels balanced in my opinion, not too strong, not too weak. The balancing of the game feels similar to how it was pre tommy gun (besides end game wind tunnels, F that). As for the  weapon, while it sucks to be sprayed at the whole game, I see more success running an AR over a Tommy overall. Running 2 weapons has been the most efficient for me this season, and having the accuracy of the AR for picks and mid range I’ve seen is better for point gain in the end, especially with the inefficiency of shoot and switch in the current meta. The horizontal bloom pattern makes the tommy gun much worse than than the p90 at mid range, and 1 on 1, the combat shotgun theoretically should smack any spray and pray dave that comes at you (with good enough aim). 

So... why all the hate on the shotgun and Tommy Gun? End game the tommy gun can be annoying but I’m a believer in the “if I die I could’ve done something better” ideal. I don’t think there’s ever a “there’s nothing you can do about that” when faced with the Tommy guns, unless it’s a 1v2. 

I really want to see good arguments on the whole pro pump anti-combat thing. I want to have a wholistic perspective but all I see is complaints. Where is the pump better than the combat throughout mid/late game and end game where the game’s meta matters most? Or is it more of a comfort thing. I see all this about skill gap, but what part of the skill gap is changed? I see the term used in between sentences as a qualifier for people’s statements but I never see a good explanation for it. I see more skill in shot tracking than 1 pump personally.

This on top of the fact that the game is in the worst state its ever been in is making it very hard to play this game atm. Been playing since season 1 and i've never wanted to stop playing this game as much as I do right now.",FortniteCompetitive

I don't know why it's still in the game, all I can assume is that it's the love-child of some Director at Epic or something. It's imbalanced. It's boring and because of the slipstream it is now redundant.  


But firstly, vaulting the pump was a great move. The gun was imbalanced to the point where if you didn't have one, you basically couldn't fight. This meant the outcome of engagements (especially early) were largely reliant on RNG. This, coupled with the fact that a player could ultimately land a lucky 1-shot, meant that luck played a huge role in engagements, all revolving around this one weapon.  


The introduction of the slipstream is insanely underrated. The slipstream is basically global mobility that is equally accessible to everyone at all times. Rifts were great, but only available at certain POIs and only to the first few users.  Gysers were very close to great but only available at certain POIs. And vehicles are RNG.   


The slipstream evens the playing field for mobility and reduces any luck factors that may play into one specific player's advantage. And the pump might've felt good, but it too was incredibly driven by chance. Instead of hoping for a 1-pump, you now have to consistently hit your shots (this goes for all skill levels and ultimately creates a positive, proper skill gap without breaking the game).",FortniteCompetitive

Being able to one pump someone was great - it's a way to finish fights really fast, which helps support getting 3rd partied and offers you chance to help defend yourself against someone who has more health than you or when going against more than one person.

However, it might be better that there is not any one-shots for the shotguns.

Before I explain that, I am going to address body shots in season 8.

Getting 100-110 damage for a body shot was way too much to the body, as the body is a bigger target, which is much easier to hit. So, getting reward that much damage on a bigger, easier target was too much.

I am actually liking the new shotgun because of the less body damage. To me, this makes shotgun fights more fun and intense because of trading more shots back and forth, making fights gradually intense and fun.

Now, maybe taking one-pumps (200+ shotgun damage) out of the game is a better thing because of being to easily eliminate someone in one click.

For somebody to just fly on you and elimimate you, out of no where, is a bit too easy, if the enemy doesn't notice you. So, of course, the counter for this would be to say that that person should've been more aware and built or whatever.
But...maybe it's better to have one pumps out.

The transition to think of this, if one-pumps aren't going to be a thing anymore, is to, now, think of everybody as a boss and that each boss has a weak spot, where you can do a bunch of damage. Body shots are low damage and headshots are the weak points, high damage spots.

Someone made a comment/post, also, stating that the new combat shotgun/tac is more skill-based because it takes more shots to eliminate someone.  Meaning, Tfue vs average player, first to one point wins. The average playee has a better chance at winning because all that is required is just one good shot to the head.

Again, though, I'm torn between one pumps and no one pumps. So, maybe they should balance it to where body shots are like 60-80 damage with headshots as one pump, but of course there being drop off damage.

So, it takes more skills as it is based off who has more consistent aim and can hit more shots within a larger end score.

This guy makes a great post about the perfect shotgun, where I've made some of these thoughts based off what this person has said:

I've started fortnite 4 or 5 days ago, and as a complete beginner, I took some time to think about the ""ultimate keybinds"" so that I don't need to tweak them later. I'm by no mean a good player (250 points arena after 4 days, so pretty much a big bot), but I think my keybinds are quite good, and any criticism would be appreciated in any case.

&amp;#x200B;

What are the requirements for good keybinds? To me, you need to be able

&amp;#x200B;

1. to move forward with all builds, and to keep the freedom of left and right movement while editing for better fake edits, or simply to do 90s while strafing   because apparently they are faster (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBOFspOHUk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBOFspOHUk))
2.  to be able to edit very fast,
3.  to be able to strafe in both directions and to move forward while editing too,
4.  to have an instant edit reset.

&amp;#x200B;

To answer 1), the idea is very simple: you have to bind +forward on your mouse (either left or right mouse button), so you don't have a busy finger on your keyboard pressing one a key and doing nothing else (it's a big waste really).

To answer 2),  a good solution is to have two edit binds, like Raider464 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWuQHYbk9RU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWuQHYbk9RU&amp;t=39s)).

How to do 3) and 4) simultaneously? The idea is actually very simple: suppose i have key A and key B to edit. You can always associate edit reset to one of the two key without fucking up with the strength of double edit. To do so, you're forced to start your edit with the same key (say A), and to confirm them with the other (say B). In this case, you can simply bind edit reset to A, so A is both your key to start an edit, and to reset it. Your ""instant edit reset"" sequence is simply ""key B, key A"" instead of ""key A, edit something, key B"" for a normal edit.

Here's an example of my proposition, which is pretty much the config I'm trying to learn right now (a bit tweaked for qwerty):

&amp;#x200B;

movement:

1. forward on ""lmb"" (you can put ""rmb"" really),
2. fire on ""rmb"" (or ""lmb""),
3. backward on ""f"" (ring finger),
4. left on ""g"" (middle finger) ,
5. right on ""h"" (pointer),
6. jump on ""space"" (you obviously use your thumb for it),
7. crouch on ""alt"" if you can press it with thumb (say) or somewhere else on the keyboard, say on ""j"",
8. ads on ""mouse5"" or on a keyboard key like ""r"" (you press with your ring finger)

&amp;#x200B;

builds:

9) floor on ""mouse 4"",

10) wall on ""d""  (ring finger),

11)  cone on ""n"", (pointer),

12) ramp on ""t"", (middle finger),

&amp;#x200B;

Here, you might think that it's impossible to strafe left while pressing the ramp key, and impossible to strafe right while pressing the cone key. In practice, you can just translate fingers very quickly and it's perfectly symmetric and doable.

&amp;#x200B;

edit:

13) edit ""engage"" with ""z"" (using your pinky),

14) edit confirm with ""c"" (using your ring finger)

15) edit reset on scroll down (say),

16) edit reset on ""z"",

&amp;#x200B;

Remark that these binds allow you to move forward and to strafes in both direction while strafing and moving forward without any problem. You engage every edit with z, and close every edit with c. If you want to instant reset, you just invert  that and start first with c, and finish with z. Of course, if you have to reset then edit, you simply press ""c"" ""z"" ""z"" ""your edit""  ""c"" or ""c"" ""z"" ""c"" ""c"" for more speed depending on which finger is the quickest to double tap.You can easily fake edit window on ramp, and can do that while strafing, using the scroll wheel.

Anyway, I'm not a good player, so I don't have any clip (yet) of the strength of these keybinds. Are those the ultimate keybinds or can you guys do better?",FortniteCompetitive

The World Cup is in shambles, the game’s reward for skill decreases everyday, and the future of BR comp after Worlds is very unclear. A lot of people are planning to, or already have quit competitive Fortnite. Established pros, a lot of talented amateur players, all the way down to people just competing because they like to.

I think we have all kind of accepted that this is the beginning of the end. We have also fully realized now that the “competitive” scene of this game is really just promotional, and we are all pawns. 

I fully believe that the competitive side of this game would have functioned just as effectively as an advertisement if it was given competitive integrity. What has Epic gained from this advertisement that they would not have in this scenario? 

And not only that, but running this game with a lot more respect, care, and thought would have created something really amazing. The core mechanics of this game allow for so much skill. Nothing has captivated my interest like an endgame moving zone, a late-game rotate, a good buildfight, or a skillful outplay has. 

I fully believe from the bottom of my heart that Fortnite as a well-oiled machine of an esport would have been extraordinary. I had no interest in esports before this game, and although I’m shamed to say that, think of how many other people that applies to. This game could have not only been a really incredible esport, it could have grown the entirety of it, and spread it to a conventional audience in much the same way that Fortnite did for video games and Twitch when it was first released. Those from outside of the community (who view Fortnite as a joke) may not have anymore, which could have grown the game (or at least prolonged its life). It would increase and prolong player retention within the diehard fan base. 

I don’t want to turn this post into a hate parade on Epic, but I am so saddened to see such incredible potential be thrown at the wind from incompetence and carelessness. Truly, it makes me sad. 

Without sizable moves from Epic, I think all of this was just a big waste of time, and a massive waste of money. I’m not here to roll around in a ball, fly around the map, or dance. I’m here to try to compete and win, and I think that applies to all of you. Epic just gave us false hope that they were going to try with competitive. 

TLDR: Competitive Fortnite is dying from the game’s decreasing reward for skill and poor treatment from Epic, leading people to quit or plan to quit. Treating the comp scene with more care would have created an amazing esport that would have also functioned as an effective advertisement. Epic threw FN’s esport potential out the window, and gave us false hope that they were going to try to do something good with that potential.",FortniteCompetitive

I’m a freshmen in high school taking pre-calculus, AP Computer Science, and AP statistics. I’m the top of my class, acing all my classes, and I am very responsible. In my free time, I like to play the game that we all know so well — Fortnite. I also play two instruments, piano and cello. 

Before the World Cup was announced, I was a causal competitive minded player. I played only pubs, rarely playing FNPL scrims here and there. 

Once competitive play was opened to all players 13+, I solely put my time to playing arenas/customs to practice. In the first week I ever competed, I placed top 500 in the Blackheart cup finals, never playing a “true” competitive match before. 

After that, I’ve kept a fairly consistent placement in the World Cup, usually top 500 in the finals. However, I find that I’m heavily limited by my ping (70+) and my practice time. 

How can I convince them that this is almost like a sport, in which that you have to practice everyday, in which you have your drills and warmup routines, and that only the best of the best can win money off of it.

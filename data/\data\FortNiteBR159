They’re always asking for things that Epic Games would probably never do because all they want to do is close the skill gap, it would be a smart decision to do that in a business standpoint, but for all the talented players, it’s getting awfully boring. So let’s not give them the satisfaction they want, let’s just quit. All the people complaining, all the streamers playing fortnite when they don’t enjoy it but play it because their fans want it, and fellows that only play fortnite because their friends play it, let’s quit. Let’s show epic games what they’ve done to their game, let’s show them what we’re made of.",FortNiteBR

My suggestions to nerf would be firstly remove the instant 1000 health of the piece it's put on, just make it the same health as what it's built on. Beyond that they need to make it so there is no invisible hitbox to the turret at all, if you can see the guy sat in it you should be able to shoot him. And I think they should make the overheat time even lower again and make the penalty for fully over heating even worse maybe even do damage over time to the person sat in it until it's cooled down",FortNiteBR

But I feel like 1 of the 2 biggest problems with turrets is that, other then being almost impossible to hit someone on a turret front on, the fact that it can spam a ""world war"" amount of bullets on you with a few seconds of cooldown every now and then.

This is another example

He also steals the thumbnails of others that are a lot smaller than him.

I feel like he should be hwid banned so that he cannot continue playing the game, because this is the same as copying someone in a test meaning it is unfair that he is profiting off of someone else's original idea.

I propose a way to stop this from happening, as well as address all the things that people have concerns about.

Basically, the only way you can fully die is if your entire squad also dies. Remove thirsting plain and simple. Keep in the slowly lose health, but increase it to 100 seconds unless you’re in the storm, in which case it would be 1hp per second lost plus whatever damage the storm does

Some concerns people have and how to address them:

Concern: People thirst to get extra mats and meds

Solution: When you get knocked you drop everything, except whatever is in your first inventory slot, so if you get resurrected and immediately get third partied you have some way to defend yourself

Concern: People thirst so you can’t call out their locations

Solution: You can see for 5 seconds before your vision fades to black and you are unable to move, basically being unconscious

Another suggestion I would make, but have not come up with any ideas to balance it is that as soon as the entire squad of the person who downed you gets killed, you get automatically resurrected, ready to fend off any third-partyers

&amp;#x200B;

The offer only lasts till the 31st of December, so do people think that after that time it may appear in the shop? I'm going to assume not but i can keep my fingers crossed.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, alternatively, it would be great to see a skin LIKE the Galaxy Skin that people can actually buy. There are some great skins out there, but none that have that 'portal through body' effect - seems like a wasted opportunity to not use this on a different skin as i would **throw** my money at it.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic should at-least offer an alternative for the people who aren't able to get the Galaxy Skin - they usually do this every season with an alternative to the tier 100 skin so it'd be great to see that happen with this too.

Not just Reddit, but the the whole PLETHORA of Fortnite’s social media begged Epic Games to put Tender Defender and accessories in the game. 

And it happened. Epic Games, you made a little boy’s wish of a skin he made come to video game life. And for that, me and many other people say thank you.

I bought the skin as soon as it came out in the shop, and I have to say it will forever be one of my favorite skins in the game, and I will wear it almost all the time. Did you guys buy the skin? If not you definitely should. It’s a great skin with great meaning to it.

Cheers!

I'm tier 84 ish and I'm not even sure I'm going to get the OG music. It sucks because we just had midterms and had to study a shitload for them. I've rarely gotten a chance to play between homework and studying for tests or projects, and when I do get a chance to play fortnite it's only for an hour. One way to fix this is to lower the difficulty of challenges in the battle pass. I know what you guys are going to say "" why buy the battle pass then?"" Simple, hanging out with friends and completing challenges is the fun part (the easy ones.) but they're not fun when they get tedious and long. (Also, pets, like who doesn't want those???) Thanks for listening guys and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. ",FortNiteBR

1. Keep the guided missile in the vault. Even though I doubt it'll come back, just... keep it in there.
2. Change the rarity of the double barrel to blue and purple. As much as I love the gun, it isnt worthy of purple/gold. Keep the spawn rate where it is.
3. This might make some people mad, but make the suppressed ar green/blue. It really isnt good or powerful enough to be purple/gold or even blue/purple. That's just me though, not a big fan.
4. Get rid of the blue heavy ar, make it only purple/gold. The blue is way to common and is really... not a clue weapon.
5. Up the reload speed on the grenade launcher. Make it they put the grenades in individual depending on how much you use, like a shotgun. If you use 2 out the 6, it'll be shorter, but if you use all of them it'll take a while.

This gives players something else to strive for and adds a little more exclusivity to maxing out the Tier 100 skin.

You see a maxed out Tier 100 skin you know they were grinding and earned that skin.

What do you guys think?

I received an xbox party invite after killing him, and usually i’ll join because it’s funny to hear little kids get mad over a video game. This was different though. I joined the party and was greeted by a pre-pubescent voice informing me he was DDOSing me. 

My internet immediately went down on my xbox, computer, and phone. It took about two hours of phone calls and messing with the router to get it working again. 

Even if you use the fucking turret correctly, you still get fucked by it. This kid was so mad about dying to the turret that he felt the need to DDOS me. 

This is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me in 10+ years of gaming. I’ve had plenty of messages and party invites in the past, but this was another level. My room mates were using the internet to do homework, and they were interrupted because I killed a kid with a turret.

I will never enter a turret again after that. It’s just not worth it. 

Epic if you see this, you must understand. This item does not belong in the game. It’s overpowered, and there is no outplay. In the situation where i killed this kid, there was absolutely nothing he could have done to counter my turret. He found this so frustrating he fucking attacked me with cyber terrorism. 

What’s even shittier about this whole situation is that i have this kids exact gamertag, and proof through messages that he DDOS attacked me, and xbox will do nothing about it. I called microsoft support and explained the situation, and was directed to enforcement.microsoft.com to report this kid like any other incident on xbox. In other words nothing is going to fucking happen to him. 

If children can do this, and get away with it, then what’s stopping them from doing it to the next player that kills them? This kid deserves to be banned for such toxic behavior. I mean he fucked over my room mates just trying to do homework, who have never played fortnite in their lives.

I don’t know what to do now, this child is probably out there DDOSing people right now, and i have his name, and proof that he did it to me, but he’s getting away with zero consequences. 

This was the shittiest thing that’s ever happened to me while gaming, and if it ever happens again i might have to step away from the toxicity pit we call fortnite. 

I know witch hunting is prohibited but like i can’t imagine someone who deserves it more. Ahem....if you....*cough*....if you’d like......*cough* *cough*....me to message you....ahem...his gamertag....*sneeze* *cough*....i would love....ahem *cough* if someone knew....*interruption to avoid with hunting suspicion*...anything i could do to get this kid in trouble. 

Seriously though, Reddit, what do i do about this?",FortNiteBR

It has released across ALL platforms, everyone has at least seen a commercial advertising it, etc. Most people have either played or tried Fortnite, then decided if they're gonna move on or not. The game is at a decline as of now, but nothing extravagant. With other highly anticipated AAA titles releasing, people are moving over to those game and either taking a break or have completely moved on from Fortnite. With that being said, if Epic wants to retain its player base and stop this decline, things need to change.

So I deleted fortnite today. I've got hundreds of dollars invested into the game, between skins, emotes, accessories, etc. &amp; I literally just can't play it anymore. I'm so sick of the early game loot, I'm tired of losing my first gun fight to a guy that has a blue pump, gold scar, gold P90, full shield, and unlimited mats. Meanwhile, I land in the SAME building (usually trump tower in tilted) and find all sorts of different types of gray pistols, bandages, gray bursts, and oh... did I mention shotgun ammo? No shotgun, just shotgun ammo. 

My suggestion? Simple. VAULT THE GRAY PISTOL. VAULT THE GRAY BURST. Why the hell would I want to find ammo for a gun, when I don't even have that gun?

But believe me, Streamer[420] has alllllll the loot. 0 kills, but an inventory full of things I literally don't get my hands on until the last gun fight. You'd think I would eventually get lucky and find great loot if I keep taking the same route, over and over again... right? Of course! once in a while I get a green burst, or a green pistol, and a gray tac, and maybe if the game's feeling REALLY generous, I'll get mini's and a med kit. 

I'd like to elaborate on why I think the gray burst and pistol should be canned. Each gun in the game, should be in the game because it's unique in it's own way. 

Base AR: fully automatic, high accuracy, rewarding headshot damage.
Scar: High damage, high accuracy, very rewarding headshot damage, fully automatic
Famas: three round burst, medium damage, shots hit accurately, rewarding headshot damage. 
Burst: three round burst (like the famas), lower damage than the famas, less accurate than the famas, and good luck hitting a headshot. 
I'm not even taking rarity into account here, because I am literally more comfortable engaging into a close range gun fight with a grenade launcher than with a BLUE burst, let alone a gray burst. I will literally die without a weapon before I pick up a gray burst or a pistol. 
Solo loot is remarkably worse than it should be. I've looted entire houses before &amp; walked out with ammo and bandages. As more and more guns are regularly added to the game, the chances of finding decent weapons decreases dramatically. You'd think it would be the other way around, more weapons means less likelihood of finding a gray burst/pistol... right? Nope. Because the only weapons that have been recently added to the game are either blue, or higher, other than the six shooter, and I refuse to carry a six shooter. 
The actual solution to this? Make it so any gun, despite the rarity, drops just as often as any OTHER gun, despite the rarity. ",FortNiteBR

And I’m only saying this cause I see other people complain and saying that the game sucks and Don’t know why the Game is like “This” (Easy). And I think the game sucks cause I played it when it was barely popular (Beta) And Late in 2017 but now it’s really stupid cause Everybody has been throwing in ideas and Suggesting different things to put in/Make and it just ruined the game.

For example People wanted Guns, Patch updates, Skins Etc. But since then they’ve been putting stuff in and all I see is people complain Saying that it’s “Overpowered” And Should “Nerf” it and what not. And I just think it’s ridiculous that People do this crap. Throwing in ideas just to complain. And I realized I actually made a post about this almost a year ago saying that the game was gonna be ruined cause of these Ideas/Suggestions. And what do you know No one cared lol (not the point) Cause I Remembered people just coming up with skin ideas and Did not have a problem with that at all cause I thought it was cool that they did, but In game ideas, I think it ruined it. 

Anyways just wanted to share my Opinion on this cause I haven’t played Fortnite For 3 months cause of all the stuff they did and I actually blame Everyone. Not Pointing to Any specific Things in the game or whatever but Just seeing it now, and it makes me glad that I don’t play this game anymore cause it just sucks now, and the only thing that would make me play again is if they made a game mode with the Old version of Fortnite. Just plain natural with None of this Extra crap.

[Shotgun timers ruin competitive by limiting players speed to what epic  feel comfortable with. Everything else in the game is too fast paced to warrant such a delay after a shot. Even if you have one shotgun the delay is still present which I thought was a bug when it was first introduced. I feel like we'd see a completely different competitive scene if the shotguns we're reworked. Even if they didn't allow pump-pump or heavy-heavy I'd still use pump-tac over pump-smg. Also, If you shoot your shotgun, and switch back to try and prefire someone who's going to make a predictable play, your shotgun will just shoot when the timer is over regardless of whether or not you wanted to the gun to shoot or not.

* Dynamite/Clingers

Either one is just hell to fight. Dynamite destroys everything in a wide radius and Clingers can do damage through **buildings** if you throw 2 or more. 

* Stink Bombs

Only exists to stop people from turtling and having good positioning.

* Heavy AR

Direct upgrade to the SCAR no matter the rarity. Too accurate for how much damage it does.

I guess some of this might come as common sense, its really simple, but when I started focusing on ""downtime"" it really changed my gameplay. This is more abstract, meta-analysis than it is a building trick, but it is surprisingly easy to spot once you look out for it. If you compare Ninja to MrSavageM (both excellent players) for examples, ninja often leaves himself barely any downtime while savage takes advantage of his ridiculous sensitivity to give himself tons of downtime.

I would like to know your guys' thoughts on my suggestions for how epic can add counters to turtling.

&amp;#x200B;

My first idea that I've read elsewhere on this subreddit is to add a 6th inventory slot dedicated to utility items.  This could potentially include glider redeploys/balloons, however particularly for throwables. Right now, throwables are decent but simply aren't worth carrying most of the time when you could have extra heals or an SMG in their spot instead.  Stinks and dynamite for example are both decent for countering turtling and aren't OP like the deagle/RPG. I'd argue clingers would need to be vaulted if this happened though, since they would be toxic to deal with constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second is to buff shotgun damage to builds up to 100%. This would mean shotguns deal a maximum of 110 damage to builds at close range, and would be useful to wall replace people turtling without being as cancerous as the deagle since you can't immediately follow it up with another shotgun shot and it would only work against newly placed builds.

Usually while playing I have cold hands and it's really annoying to play then, my mouse movement doesn't feel as smooth and I simply don't like having cold hands.
When it's my lucky day and I start with 'normal' hands they usually just cool off as well, which is annoying as well. I think this is also because my hands sweat a bit and get sticky, then playing doesn't feel as nice.

Have you guys got any ideas on getting them back on temperature? I once got a kind of blood rush to my hands after I finished playing and using my mouse to navigate through youtube never felt that good before.

We’ve compiled the most pressing topics raised by the community and our internal staff. These are the main improvements you can expect for the International Edition this weekend:

&amp;#x200B;

**- New, streamlined schedule.** One of the main concerns we received was that breaks between matches were too long. We have pushed the start of broadcasts from 12PM CET to 2PM, while still aiming to complete all seven matches by 8PM CET. This means more action-packed days and more time for our pros to get some practice on the new Season 8 patch.

**- Viewing Parties.** We'll also be putting out a feed that will not have caster audio during the games, so you won't have to mute the stream and not have game sound! We'll still keep the interview &amp; pre-produced video content audio in there, so your viewers are in for a treat! [More info about that can be found here](https://www.intelextrememasters.com/season-13/katowice/fortnite/viewing-party/).

**- Dedicated stream with map/alive status.** This was a big topic and we are trying to figure out all the technical details to make it happen. We will have a definitive answer on this topic for you soon.

**- Consistent standings update.** We have ironed out some kinks in our data-gathering to make sure that the overall standings could be shown on stream more often. This was already seen on Day 2 of the Polish Edition and should not pose an issue during the International Edition. We're also looking at ways to pull this data during the game to show live-updating standings during the game.

We'll be giving everyone access to our HUD, commercials &amp; intros. We'll also be putting out a feed that will not have caster audio during the games, so you won't have to mute the stream and not have game sound! We'll still keep the interview &amp; pre-produced video content audio in there, so your viewers are in for a treat! [More info about that can be found here](https://www.intelextrememasters.com/season-13/katowice/fortnite/viewing-party/).

**- Broadcast.** We're working on some smaller quality of life changes to be able to give you a better overview of what's happening and keep you part of the action. We're super excited to share those, but we don't want to give away all our secrets just yet. Stay tuned for the broadcast this weekend!

&amp;#x200B;

We will continue to improve based on your feedback this weekend, so keep the comments coming.

[**Full broadcast schedule here.**](https://www.intelextrememasters.com/season-13/katowice/fortnite/international/) **&amp;** [**you can watch the stream here**](https://www.twitch.tv/esl_fortnite)

Especially on console as all we see is a speed up blurry version of someone editing and pumping them which happened a seconds ago for the enemy making it pretty much impossible to shoot them back in time.

Its made it extremely hard for console to compete in cross-play Tournaments as PC players can already use their instant reset scroll wheel and now can edit, pump and reset on you before someone on console can possibly see anything that happened.

Got the strikepack 2 months ago and can never go without paddles again. Never intended to switch to PC, but I need a new laptop anyways and I can buy a decent gaming laptop from MSI (i7-8750H, RTX 2060, 16 GB RAM) for 21% off at my local store. Sounds like a great deal on a laptop that will outperform my PS4 in every way, especially since I need a decent laptop anyways, so I'm thinking about making the jump. The idea of being able to record my own gameplay and watch it again to learn from my mistakes, stretched res, graphical settings, etc. has got me excited.

However, I've read that you can't use the strikepack on PC, but I've also heard people say you actually can. I'm kinda confused. Is there a way to play with the strikepack on PC or not? Is there someone who actually uses a strikepack on PC? I also have to buy a new monitor if I want to get the 144Hz so if a new controller with paddles also is necessary it might become a bit to expensive.

For those about to tell me to switch to M&amp;KB: don't bother. I work 50-60 hours a week and I have other things in my life. I can play around 10 hours a week so I don't have time to put in that work. Never played any games on M&amp;KB before so I try be the best I can on controller. ",FortniteCompetitive

98,bsneath45,1551247843,ava2dg,15,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ava2dg/optimal_controller_binds/,0,Optimal Controller Binds,"I play on controller and take the game pretty seriously - I'm always looking for ways to improve and optimize my gameplay. One of the biggest limitations on controller, in my opinion, is that you have to take your thumbs off of the analog sticks to perform various controls, limiting your movement and aim. Recently, I've invested in an elite controller with paddles to try and solve this problem, and I spent all last night messing around and trying to find the optimal binds to minimize the amount that my thumbs have to move from the analog sticks. I want to share my thoughts and see what other competitive controller players think before I spend the next week becoming comfortable with the new controls. I totally understand that binds do not automatically make a player better, but I've spent so much time optimizing other aspects of my game that this seemed like the logical next step. Anyways, I'd love to have a discussion about these binds if anyone has any thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

So aside from triggers/bumpers, there are really six binds that allow you to keep your thumbs on the sticks (I don't play claw and don't intend to ever do so). These are L3, R3, and the four paddles. I figured that the six most important things to have on these binds are as follows (keep in mind I use sprint by default):

1. Jump (L3) - this is obvious, need to be able to jump and aim at the same time
2. Crouch (Paddle) - Same reasoning as jump. I moved this from R3 to a paddle to make it easier to aim and crouch spam
3. Edit (Paddle) - I feel like the majority of my kills come from edits (wall replaces, ramp over someone and edit down, etc.) so this is a very important bind to be able to do as quickly as possible, especially during build fights
4. Enter build mode (Paddle) - Also pretty obvious, you want to be able to do this as quickly as possible to block shots, pull out your gun in a build fight, tfue classic, etc...
5. Trap picker / place / interact (R3) - traps are OP and having to move your thumb to place them is just too slow when someone jumps into your box or you pyramid someone
6. Change material / Trap (Paddle) - I recently realized that this bind is pretty important, especially now with the 500 mat cap. It's good to be cognizant of which material you are using during build fights or endgame when you can't farm anymore. Also great to be able to switch between traps / launch pads quickly

&amp;#x200B;

Note: 5 and 6 are in ""build controls"", and they can really be anything for combat controls. Personally, I like having Reload / Interact on R3 and inventory on the paddle. One thing I wanted on a paddle or stick was pickaxe for quick wall replaces. However, pickaxe gets bound in both build controls and combat controls no matter what, so I would have to sacrifice either 5 or 6 (which I think are slightly more valuable). So I just left pickaxe on A.

&amp;#x200B;

As for edit controls, there are a ton of options here. Personally, I have Select on RT, Confirm on LT, and reset on a paddle (jump and crouch stay the same). I feel like as long as those three binds are on either triggers/bumpers, sticks, or paddles, you are good. 

&amp;#x200B;

So those are my current binds (at least the important ones). I'd love to know if you guys think they are good or could be better. I've seen a decent amount of posts lately asking about the best controller binds but not a lot of detailed responses, so hopefully other controller players can benefit from this.",FortniteCompetitive

But after playing wireless ever since Logitech released the best mouses I have ever tried(I own g903, g703 and g305) I’m kinda worried about the cable.

The G305 was my last purchase, and it feels so light and chill to use and even though it’s kinda small, it fits good with my fingertip grip, and it took the thrown from my precious 703!

So when MaxGaming suddenly had 20+ air58 in store yesterday I had to buy it(actually thought it was a bug on their webpage(has happend once before)).

But now I’m worried about the cable and the fact that I forgot to add hyperglides in the order. No problem, I will just do another purchase.

But is it necessary? How is the glides on the Air 58?

Also, do I need a bungee? And if so, what is your best pick and why?

Was looking at the zowie bungee but IMHO it aint pretty at all, and I’ve spent more then a decent amount of money for aesthetics only. Many of you wouldn’t believe me if I told you the numbers just because of some simple tiny ocd things that triggered me. But quality over aesthetics now I guess 🤔

Anyway, enough offtopic.

Discord did disable our server after a serious of crashes and massive performance problems in the last few weeks. 

As part of our solution to resolve the performance issues, we shifted major parts of our staff infrastructure to another discord and removed the role ""verified by yunite"". 


Discord stated that the amount (around 100.000) of the ""verified by yunite"" role given out was to much and so we had to find another way to verify people. 

From now on you have to verify by yunite and link your verified epic account with the SnipeLobbyBot in order be able to join the SnipeLobbyBot Lobby. If you are not verified by yunite you cant join the lobby. Simple as that. 

If you have problems with verifying your self or cant join the lobby even though you are or were verified in the past please use the modmail system. Questions in chats will be deleted. 

Again we are sorry for this and hope you have a lot of fun playing the best and most stacked snipe lobbys in the world.

What do you guys think about a mechanic like this? To be denied access to the next zone in the late game simply because of a too steep climb is pretty dumb and provides unecesarry RNG. Just finished reading the [brilliant Pop Up survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/av37kk/popup_cup_survey_results/) done by [u/theonialator](https://www.reddit.com/user/theonialator) questioning all kinds of stuff about the pop ups where this specific topic was brought up.

&amp;#x200B;

71% of the participants wanted a change to the endgame circles, out of these 50% answered the following:

""the ability for the storm to go up a vertical hill should be removed, (as it causes aids rotations and increases mobility RNG tenfold)""

While I fully agree with the last part of the statement, I kind of feel like this would be pretty hard from an engineering point of view. I also feel like having a map with significant differences in altitude provides a lot of tactical thinking in early to mid game in competitive play and therefore does have a place in the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Will this be an interesting mechanic to test in a pop up? And if so, how should it be designed? I personally would love to see this tested as it may reduce the absolute clusterfuck of building in hillsides endgame in competitive play and give low ground players fucked by zone RNG some chance to clutch up a win.

Something I immediately think about is that this solely should function on the terrain. Not playerbuilt or destructible structures in general.",FortniteCompetitive

I would first like to say thank you for the overwhelming support I've received. Pop-up cups, while not the perfect solution to the ranked mode we might all like to see, have personally brought to life the comp world of Fortnite for me and, I'm sure for many other players. Hopefully these will evolve into something better and better as we edge closer to the world cup and as the community evolves over the months and years to come. With that all being said, on to the data. 

**WILL TO CHANGE**

What’s always been so impressive and appealing about Fortnite to many players is its constantly changing rules, weapons, loot pool, strats and much more. However, I was honestly surprised and glad to see that only 20 people (less than 3%) want no changes in pop-up cups! There is a clear will to improve or test elements in all parts of the game, from the first drop to the endgame.

**LOOT POOL TWEAKS -** Should the loot pool be tweaked in pop-ups as a test?

The first question on the survey was on the topic of the loot pool. Many see this as diluted with unneeded or worse unbalanced weapons that, while possibly suited to pubs, do not suit competitive play.

When asked 'Should the loot pool be tweaked in pop-ups as a test?' 594 (84%) of you answered yes, showing a clear view that some items should be taken out or at least changed in terms of stack size, drop rate etc for competitive play. 

Highlights when asked what should change in this category were:

\- 294 (\~50% of people who said yes) think that clingers should be re-replaced by grenades, showing that half of the comp playerbase think that grenades were more balanced than clingers when they were added back into the game in 7.40

\- 285 (48% of people who said yes) think that shields should spawn more often in pop-up cups, although I plan to investigate whether this is true across the board or just in pop-ups, showing that even after the recent shield for kill change in 7.40 people may still feel there is a lack of heal items in Fortnite

\- 213 (36%) of you think that stink bombs should have a more limited stack size and 216 of you think that bushes, despite the recent buff, should not be in pop-ups

\- Finally, 204 (34%) of you think that blue to gold weapons only should be spawned in pop-up cups, showing that at least a third of players want an elimination of grey and green weapons from the pop-up cups, and 189 (31%) want grey weapons and green weapons to spawn only as floor loot but not in chests, although there may be some overlap on this front meaning the figure wanting to eliminate grey and green weapons at least from chests is most likely more like 40-50%.

**HEALS/HEALTH IN GAME -** Should heals and healing items be changed in some way?

This question was the most negatively received leading me to believe that many are happy with the way heals are right now due to the 7.40 patch. 502 (74%) people said that heals did not need to be changed in the game. However, of those who answered yes,

\- 120 (50%) said that players should start the game with 200 health, and I counted almost 60 (\~25%) people in the 'other' section asking for an assisted kill feature, something which I know is heavily requested.

**ENDGAME STORM MOVEMENTS -** Should storm movement adjustments be tested?

This was the second most requested change to pop-up cups, with 453 (71%) of you wanting some adjustments to the endgame circles. Of these, the most coveted changes were:

240 (\~50% of those who answered the question - with some users skipping) wanted a change that the storm should stop closing in after storm circle number 8, preventing heal battles and forcing confrontations as mats ran out

239 (\~50%, obviously) of you wanted the ability for the storm to go up a vertical hill to be changed, as it causes aids rotations and increases mobility RNG tenfold

128 (29%) of you wanted the storm to start closing in from above in these late moving zones, as this would force players on highground slowly down into confrontations, and solving Epic and the game's problem of highground being OP (according to some)

**EDITING CHANGES -** Should editing be tweaked?

In regards to editing changes in light of the architect feature implemented earlier this season, it is clear that there is still a (albeit small) majority for tweaks to editing, with 345 (55%) of you voting that yes, there should be changes tested. Of those that said yes, 340 (98% of the people that voted yes, and almost half of people who even started the survey) of you voted that you should be able to edit the structures of a person you've killed, making it a clear desire for players at this time (although it must be said that some of the more knowledgable on this sub may be aware of server issues that could be caused in terms of working out permissions ingame.

This was the only editing change with any wide support and may be something to see in the future.

**POINT SYSTEM**

Finally, the point system. Over the past few weeks I have seen countless arguments about the point system, from Share the Love's lack of placement reward, to the coveted Katowice system, to an alternative system proposed by u/ivoalbino . Therefore, it is no surprise that when asked whether the point system needed a change, 412 (69%, ayy) said yes. The final results show that of this 70%, 301 (73%) wanted to change to either u/ivoalbino's system, linked below, or the Katowice point system, linked below and found on pages 4,5, and 6. 

Thank you to all that participated and I hope to make another survey soon. I hope this data sheds some light on hoped changes and where generally the active sub stands in terms of pop-up cups and where we should go from here.

We all know the one , build fight begins , get a decent pump shot off , claim high ground and the opponent drops down and boxes up. Sometimes among the builds i find it hard to instantly locate where they actually are and I seem to take too long to get the wall replace. Leading to the inevitable 3rd party sniper/heavy assault. It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I have to take stinks as a quick counter but I want to free up that inventory slot especially in solos. I also find that many players are wise to certain edit and expect them , I don’t seem to make a window edit without taking a hit myself.

Any help would be great and thank for taking the time to read through if you did so ! ",FortniteCompetitive

\- Duos is the priority tournament: 400K pay (vs. 100K solos), 2x more games. 

\- 14 (fourteen!) games. That's how BRs should be: decrease randomness by repetition, not necessarily within games. That can reward high risk high returns strategy. 

\- Continuous points rewards for placement. You start earning points from placing 25th onwards \[so placing less, e.g. hot drop death, is bad\]. The increase in points is convex from there on. 

\- Continuous points for kills. 5 pts per kill, that's it! 

How are not everybody ejaculating from hype rn? 

This is the best FN tournament ever by far, especially given the presence of both EU and NA top duos.

Q to switch between builds and guns, using the scroll-wheel to switch from my shotgun to AR etc.  
My gunplay is pretty good, and I don't want to keybind any gun/shield slots.  
However, buildin is abysmal with no keybinds.  
I want to learn keybinds, but my brain is so used to the scroll-wheel that every time I've tried to apply keybinds it's the same as tellin a handicap to climb a ladder.  
The only change I've done that's actually been useful is editin with F, still scroll-wheel bound.  
TL;DR, how would I go from default binds to actual keybinds when it comes to buildin?

As any of you  who have upgraded from PS4 to PC there is a noticeable input delay that seems to increase with FPS - which is why many controller players limit their frame rate to 144. (this only applies to PS4 controller not XBOX)

Firstly it's worth noting that the deadzone on PC for PS4 controller is twice what it is on console so you should be sure to lower this - for reference issa uses 0.08, 0.05 (X/Y respectively) \[Down from I think the default 0.22/24\]

Additionally a seemingly somewhat well kept secret that I've only seen fqrbes speak about on twitter - despite many other controller players using is installing the scp toolkit to significantly improve input delay. This allows you to comfortably run the game over 144hz without delay due to their better drivers.

I’m va1edictorian and I’m back with another post with tips on improving as a competitive player. I got a ton of good feedback in my last post and so I decided to do another one, especially with the announcement of the World Cup Qualifiers, since people will be grinding to grab that 50k qualification money. My previous post focused on general tips that helped me improve in Pop-Ups and is linked below:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/anefwn/how\_i\_went\_from\_1520\_points\_in\_popup\_cups\_to\_30/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/anefwn/how_i_went_from_1520_points_in_popup_cups_to_30/)

This post is going to be focused more on the mental aspect of improving as a competitive player and how certain parts of life that may often be overlooked can drastically impact your performance as a player. Let’s get right into it!

In no particular order of importance:

1. **Physical health.** If I was forced to put a hierarchy of importance on this list, physical health would probably be at the top. Your ability to improve and learn the game is directly impacted by how healthy you are. Nutrition, exercise, and sleep are the most fundamental pillars of a healthy life-style and should be prioritized by anyone that is looking to improve at the game. We often find ourselves grinding 4+ hours of scrims/practice and we lose track of when we last drank water or when we last ate some fruit/vegetables and this can have a detrimental impact on our bodies. 3 hours of practice on a well-fed and hydrated body will be a LOT more effective than 6 hours of practice while you’re dehydrated and living off of junk food. Recently, content creators and streamers have raised awareness regarding the issue of dehydration (Symfuhny constantly advises his chat to drink water and Tfue has his own water jug in the room) which showcases how important this really is. Along with basic nutrition, sleep, and exercise, an escape from the game is VERY important in order to maintain a linear pattern of improvement. Everyone gets burnt out and we all respond to it in different ways. Some of us play other popular games, some of us spend time with family/significant other/friends, and some of us go engage in physical activity, etc. This “escape” is crucial in terms of improvement and maintaining a positive mindset as it allows your mind to reset mentally which increases the effectiveness of your practice. (Myth discussed this a while back when he would go to a coffee shop once a week and just take time to mentally recover and relax for a small period of time in his usual busy life) Essentially, you’re improvement can either be enhanced or inhibited by how much you prioritize your health.

2. Goals. Ask any successful individual, from any field of study, and they will tell you how important it is to set goals for yourself (both short-term and long-term). Goals allow you to stay on track in a game that can become very chaotic at times in terms of specifically what you need to work on. Accomplishing short-term goals can also motivate you and push you to work harder to achieve your long-term goal. A good analogy is weight-lifting and exercising. As you work out, you physically see your body change and you acknowledge these changes as you look at yourself every day. As your body changes and you start to receive external compliments, you become more likely to engage in physical activity because you see that it is working and actually causing a change. Similarly in Fortnite, if your long-term goal is to qualify for the World Cup, you can make short-term goals such as increasing your solo win percentage, or surviving late-game scrim lobbies, or even reducing your personal record time on a edit course. Achieving these small-term goals will motivate you to continue pursuing your long-term goal.

3. Blame. Take a minute and ask yourself in the most honest way possible, how many times have you blamed a death or loss or even a lackluster performance at LAN (for pros) because of RNG or an external factor that was supposedly “out of your control”. I am well aware that there are components of the game that cannot be controlled and that bugs in the game as well randomness regarding opponents/stream snipers can cause a player to die unexpectedly. Those external factors are understandable and are not the issue. The problem arises when a player that is looking to improve consistently blames external factors on a death/loss. For example, Ghost Kayuun discussed a specific scenario in his video on improving at the game. Kayuun’s example focused on a player that dies whilst he/she is holding turbo-build and their opponent’s SMG bullets randomly pierce through the structures. In that instance of time when the original player dies, he/she is probably blaming the death on the “bug” involved with turbo-building and the SMG spray. Instead of taking that death as an opportunity to look at potential mistakes that could’ve led to that situation or look at possible scenarios that could’ve ended in the player surviving (editing out earlier and building for height, taking shotgun shots in between wall replaces, or even broader mistakes such as not accounting for a player to potentially fight in that location based on rotations), this player will lose that opportunity to learn/improve because of the blame that is put on the RNG. I understand that the bugs/RNG in the game can be frustrating but imagine the mistakes that you could’ve learned/improved from if you looked at your decision objectively (ignoring the RNG and bug). We lose so much information that could help us improve because of the blame we put on factors that we cannot control. Blaming external factors also increases the chance of tilting and can lead to worse performance overall. (If you closely review Vivid’s gameplay from the Winter Royale Semifinal, in game 1 his pump ends up not shooting in a crucial end-game scenario. Immediately he recognizes the bug and calls it out. It ultimately leads to his death as he is unable to gain 50hp from the player he would’ve eliminated. After the game, he repeatedly tells himself that he “will not freak out” and continue to play without tilting. He goes on to qualify for the Winter Royale Finals instead of letting the bug affect his gameplay in the rest of the games.

4. Ego check yourself. We all have egos and we all love to flex the skills that we put hours into mastering, but 90’ing to height when the opponent has dynamite may not always be the best bet. Part of improving is taking mental notes of when you are more likely to make a decision based on your ego and when you are more likely to make a decision based on what is actually occurring. For example, if you see a player with very poor movement, most of us will immediately jump to the assumption that the player is bad and is a “bot” and our approach to the fight is completely different than it would be against a player that we would consider “good” or “sweaty”. This can also be applied to when you fight a well-known or professional player. We place these players on such high pedestals (which is deserved) but in the game this can lead to nervousness and/or extreme passivity in situations that you should be aggressive in. The problem with playing like this is that it prevents you from developing any form of consistency. You should have a general approach to fights based on events that are occurring in the game (such as situations when you have height, when the opponent has height, when you are fighting edge zone, when you are fighting whilst rotating end-game) instead of situations that are based on if the opponent is bad/average/above average. Recently, Myth has been consistently acknowledging decisions that he makes that should be “ego-checked” and by saying these things out loud, he is more likely to improve on his decision-making.

Sorry for how lengthy this post has become but I just had to get these points out there! Good luck to all who are grinding for the World Cup and I’ll be glad to discuss any topics in the comments.

Furthermore, if you guys have any pro-players in mind (players that have competed in Fall/Summer/Secret Skirmishes, PAX, TwitchCon, or Winter Royale) that you would like to be interviewed regarding their mindset on improving and preparing for a major tournament, please let me know who! It would be even better if you provided means through which I can contact said player for the interview. To add on to that, if any pros are reading this post and have gotten this far I would love to host quick-mini interview sessions where I can ask questions about your mentality going into these huge tournaments. Feel free to contact me via a reply on this post or a direct message. Thanks in advance!",FortniteCompetitive

Just like  in current era, some kids are raised to be trained specifically for eSports performance in the future. Just like figure skating and some other sports in current era, kids are partnered up from a young age with their gaming partner. They spend 10 years playing together developing their teamwork and communication before even their first competition.

In current era, this is a diluted version of what being duos with your twin may achieve. You grew up playing with them, spent your entire life understanding their communications and their actions. People say that they can read what their twin is thinking. I don't believe in that in the supernatural sense at all, but I believe that that effect seems to be going on just because they know each other SO well. I believe that before the hypothetical (but possible) aggressive training programs in the future that I describe in the first paragraph begin to becoming commonplace, the best duos partners we will see over the next few years will be twins inside and outside of solely fortnite.

Note: this is just an interesting idea that I had. I'm not saying any of this is fact. It's not even a solid opinion of mine as a lot of consideration is involved  and I don't have a lot of experience with twins. If you're interested, we can debate this in the comments.

If ranked mode is implemented and is cross platform mixed lobbies, I feel like I'm never going to be able to exceed with my console going against PC players which have advantages in tons of ways, I can only keep up so long in the end game circles with all the lag lol. I legit get fucking overwhelmed now when playing in the pop ups cause just knowing I'm at a disadvantage in hardware sucks, but I'm not gonna go fork out and get a PC just for Fortnite. I still love to play competitively but on an even playing field. I don't recall many other games forcing console players into mixed lobbies for ranked modes.

Making it where Xbox, PS4, (switch I guess also) are all in the same lobbies for ranked mode would be ideal and the population would be plenty. And for the console players that want to play in PC lobbies then they have the option to (like we have now basically).

I know that separates the PC population and makes them one strict population (with the opted-in console players), but I still think that population will be plentiful.

I can only mentally withstand wasting time and effort to bugs for so long.

* Multiple times today when going to place a trap the game had my campfires pulled out, giving the guy plenty of time to escape my box. 

* Ghost shots rob so many opportunities to apply pressure

Nothing gets playtested before release and they have even admitted as such. 

* Turrets were so so incredibly, obviously busted for entirely too long. 

* Ziplines required nearly an entire season to have an interact button applied to them. 

* Planes were so ignorantly strong that multiple nerfs were required to bring the game to a somewhat enjoyable state because they so heavily ruined what made this game uniquely stand out in the first place (building). To top it off EPIC is so prideful, that rather admit they made a mistake and roll back planes until they could be made viable but not overpowered, they subjected us to them for an entire season only to completely remove them in season 8.

Comp fortnite receives heart breakingly little support.

* Servers, even private local custom servers, still cannot handle the game.

* Comp rule sets have barely been iterated upon and comp item sets are pipe dream.

* With the largest prize pool in the history of esports of any platform, genre, or era, we still don't have any idea what the rule or point set will be and we can only barely narrow down what it could probably be. 

* Why are the only non free for all pub formats (pop up cups) limited to specific hours on specific days in specific team sizes, all decided seemingly arbitrarily so?

Lack of serious consideration for consoles.

* Look i get it, *just join the PC mustard rice lololol*, but many of us just can't drop the coin needed to get a gaming PC worth a damn. 

* Forcing us to play in the same pop up lobbies as PC without allowing us to turn off shadows and motion blur, or to adjust our deadzones and FOV LIKE ROCKET LEAGUE HAS FOR YEARS, is a slap in the face to probably the largest portion of the playerbase. 

I feel like everything I have listed above are not luxuries but rather bare minimums that have been withheld from us for long enough. I want to love this game for a long time but at this point I just can't take its future seriously as something to continue to invest time, effort, and money into. Season 8 must bring with it drastic changes and optimizations if EPIC hopes to keep my attention. ",FortniteCompetitive

Remove Grey Tacs- Grey tacs are extremely useless in early game. Especially when you contest a house off spawn and you get a tac, chances are you’re dead. 

Remove Snowmen- There’s really no need for an explanation for this. They’re completely useless and just take up floor loot/chest loot.

Remove Chiller Grenades- Again. No explanation. They take up floor loot/chest loot and nobody uses them.

Remove Infantry Rifles- I honestly don’t know what epic was thinking. The fire rate is terrible, damage is terrible, and the best part? There’s travel time. If your enemy has literally any other gun and you have an infantry rifle, it’s better off pickaxing them.

Remove Turrets- Turrets replace drops that could have been useful such as traps, cozies, and launch pads. Nobody ever uses them and they just clog up your inventory.

Buff Tacs- I don’t mean turn tacs into faster pumps. I simply mean make it so they don’t do 20/30 damage at close range.

Buff Shotguns- The buff I would really like for shotguns is damage consistency. Although they have already improved this (200 headshots/100+ body shots), I still sometimes hit gold pumps for low damage like 40-60. It would be great if the damage were more consistent as this would make sure both parties get even damage when they shoot.

Add Grapplers- The grappler was a really fun item and it was really good for rotations. They could make it have 5 charges so it’s not as OP or simply just decrease the range at which it can grapple.

As the weeks went on, more teams started picking up teams: FaZe, 100T, Ghost, and many others. 

What team has stayed nearly the same throughout this past year, and what team changed the most? 

100T just recently made some big acquisitions, as their early pickups of Parallax and Risker haven’t panned out. (Kenith is doing ok)

Obviously the situation with TSM is well known, and now Dae and Hamlinz are recognized as content creators, not pros. 

Ghost made some pickups very early on, like Zamas and Enzo, who really didnt pan out, but some of their older pickups have stuck around (Bizzle and DMO) and have been very successful. 

That being said, with the World Cup approaching, do you think many of us were correct when we said how the scene will massively change, and that we could see totally different players competing within the next year (this being what was said last year)? What has changed, what has stayed the same? Have these changes been good or bad? Why?

What if instead, we were able to hover your cursor over an item, and instead of dragging it to a different slot, we could just press the keybind for the slot that we want to switch the item to. For example, my binds are E: Pickaxe, 1-5: Weapon Slots. If I pick up a shotgun early game, it automatically puts it in the first slot, when I usually put my shotgun in the third slot, which the keybind is ""3"". If I wanted to switch it to the 3rd slot, I could just hover my cursor over the shotgun and press ""3"", and it would move the shotgun to the third slot. If there is an item in the slot that I want to switch it to, then the two items would swap slots.

on pc, in season 4 i could keep a constant 60fps with shadows on and everything else off and my default 3d resolution, which is 1600x900. season 5 rolled around and i could no longer keep 60fps with shadows on. so i had to turn my 3d resolution down to 1280x720. season 6 it was the same issue. i dealt with it at like 45-50fps (dont know how) and in season 7, the first thing i noticed was the fps drop. i can no longer keep 60fps with shadows on or off. I turn off shadows, keep default resolution and get about 50 fps. when i turn the 3d res down, i still canr keep 60fps. places like loot lake, dusty diner, and the b.l.o.ck make me get like 45 fps.

now onto switch. i played on switch back in august and it was optimized pretty well. then i stopped playing on switch and went back to pc. when i came back to my switch in season 7, performance was worse. graphics looked more pixely and they dont look as smooth as they first did when it released in june. it was actually pretty decent. up until season 7. it was tolerable, but now sonce the v7.40 patch released, you get like micro stutters and the graphics are so bad now. they are like even worse. also, we dont even have weapon stats! like pn pc or xbox or ps4 when you look at an ite in your inventory you can see weapon damage, fire rate, reload time, etc. all switch shows is dps.

What I would suggest is having the heal just after you knock someone but he'll drop mats only when finished.

In my personal Opinion I think aim assist needs to be slightly nerfed. Hypothetically if a consol player and a Pc player have the exact same building skill. Then the consol player has a huge advantage as they have less blumedud to aim assist.
But what is this advantage compared to having a streched resolution, that both makes your targets easier to hit, but boosts your Fps. As far as I know most consoles are maxed at 60fps, not only can most Pc players get more frames but they can boost this by having a streched resolution.

Would like to hear your thoughts.

Why is this never seen in Fortnite? Both stretched and black bars have the benefit of more FPS and vertical FOV. While targets appear chunkier and move faster horizontally with stretched, black bars allow for more focus on the center of the screen. Losing viewers to the unpleasant look of stretched is also an issue for streamers. Why don’t any of them at least try resizing the gameplay in OBS with black bars when playing stretched? They could even use that space to display things such as their sponsors. I saw a video posted by Atlantis Magin  on Youtube (Magin Build Fights #5) with black bars and thought it looked fine. I know it can all be a matter of preference, but I’d like someone to provide me reasons why no one does it.",FortniteCompetitive

*Make sure to read the whole thing. Something you may want to comment can be easily answered in this.*

#I call it: the gray pump.

It will have the name as “The Relic” when looked at in your inventory/while it’s on the ground.

*It will be the pump, except:*

Exactly what season 5’s pump was, with 80 max body and 160 head, long pullout time, 1 pellet rule, but with a twist:

*No circle timer.*

*HOWEVER,* the pullout time can be increased/decreased to help with balance(tested in the pop-up), maybe even add the circle timer that’s like 0.9 seconds long.

Now don’t start flaming me on bringing back double pump. *Read a little bit more.*

#These are going to be the changes made:

1 pellet rule implemented(be ready for that 7 damage again)

Don’t forget about that decreased range nerf they had in the patch that brought the spas.

You can gray-tac and double grey pump, but that’s it. You can’t grey-green or green-gray, only gray-gray or gray-tac.

I think this would bring a lot of players back and introduce more playstyles and variety.

#Now time to debunk some arguments:

*“People will only double pump/pump-tac”*

This wouldn’t be the case since using pump-smg/deag gives you the advantage of the faster pullout time, using pumps green and above, building damage, and the 3 pellet rule, while double gray pumps don’t get any of that. Pump-smg/deag will still reign supreme by far, this would just be for fun, variety, and to bring back some people who loved DP and PT(double pump and pump tac). I’m sure the game would grow a lot more if this is implemented.

*“Double Pump is an exploit”*

There’s tons of exploits in games that are kept in games to enhance gameplay. Even Fortnite has a ton. For example, rocket riding. Sure, it’s an exploit, but does that mean it’s bad? In short, exploits doesn’t always equal bad.

#And lastly, the quote from the Epic employee:

*“Double pumping was taken out of the game since pumps are balanced for their low fire rate, and using two pumps took away that disadvantage.”*

Gold, purple, blue, and green pumps are all balanced this way. The gray one, however, isn’t. It’s made to be doubled and still balanced with its way lower damage, way longer pullout time, and 1 pellet rule.

It can’t hurt to add this back. Any time you would die to this, you wouldn’t say “oh be double pumped that’s the reason I died”, you would rather say “I would’ve died so much quicker if that guy was using pump-smg/deagle”. This would definetly not be viable in competetive play, just for fun.",FortniteCompetitive

Recently I decided to reevaluate my keybind situation, and realized that I was actually using the same finger (index) for 2 of my build binds, and have been since I started playing the game.  However, I've been having some trouble repositioning said keybind due to my odd WASD finger placement.  Unlike most players, I naturally place my ring finger on W, pinky on A, middle finger on D, and move my index finger between keys to the right of WASD.

&amp;#x200B;

My current keybinds are:

WALL - Q (press this with my pinky)

RAMP - F (press this with my index)

FLOOR - V (The keybind that I would like to switch because I also press with my index)

CONE - Forward Mouse Button

PICKAXE - Back Mouse Button

Weapon Binds - 1 through 5

Inventory - Tilde (\~)

Map - TAB

&amp;#x200B;

Any help with this issue would be appreciated, thanks in advance.  ",FortniteCompetitive

It seems like it should be an easy one to handle, but for some reason I choke this particular situation a lot. 

Scenario: 1 vs 2+ me being the solo, I have high ground on a mountain or a building. The height difference maybe being 3-4 stories, so within reach of them building up. 

When one of them pushes me and the other sits on the ground, I get stuck. I try and take shots at the person building up on me and will sometimes get tagged, most the time I place cover so the lower player isnt able to get direct shots. Other times I will attempt to build towards the pushing player to maintain high ground but then will get shot out by the low ground teammate. So then I get discouraged and hold my ground. Which leads to the pushing player to obtain high ground. I'm then in the situation where I still have each separated and could attempt to fight one or the other but still face similar consequences as before. If I try and push the guy above I have many more factors to consider. The low ground player will still shoot me out if I attempt to push up and regain high ground. And I'll also be taking shots from above. Or if I decide to try and drop down to ground level to push that player I then have shots coming from above and also below as I make my way down. 

Obviously if I have a launch pad or a rift I can reset the fight, but many times neither are an option. I am curious if you guys have any tips as to how I can adjust my approach or even have I evaluate this scenario. Maybe I am being too cautious here by worrying about getting shot down by the low ground player. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Now, it seems like Hysteria might be leaving as well (source: twitter bio states he is a FA), and a twitter reply from Pupper (former coL player) might explain it.

The tweet can be found here: https://twitter.com/pupper/status/1099093414237347840?s=19

For context, basically Symfuhny tweeted that he hopes that whoever wins the World Cup isn't part of an org so they don't have to split the money, and Convertibles mentioned that some pros out there have up to a 50/50 split with their org. This obviously seems like a horrible deal for any high level player, due to the amount that can be won from Fortnite. 

Pupper replied to Convertibles mentioning C9. If they really do take that high of a cut of winnings, than it makes perfect sense why Zoof and Blind left, and why Hysteria decided to leave just after the World Cup announcement and the huge potential earnings that he doesn't want to split.

Obviously Pupper could have no idea what he is talking about, but he probably is friends with some of the former C9 players, and I don't know why he would say this for no reason.",FortniteCompetitive

&gt; “I work in esports and draft rules like this pretty frequently. What it means is:

•	⁠If you're older than 18 you can play without parental permission.
•	⁠


If you're between the ages of 13 and 17 you must have parental permission. *
If you're 13 or younger you cannot play.

If the game is rated differently in your home country (if the game is rated MA15+ in your country for example) then you would need to be 15 or older to play, not 14 (with parental permission) like you could in some other countries.” 



This generally means that as long as you are over the age of 13, and the game isn’t age restricted at a higher age than you in your country (ie, in the UK it is rated 12, so anyone above 13 can play with permission), you can play. Hope this clears things up :)

(weapon delay),"I have been playing fortnite since around late October and the weekly updates had been amazing. This is the first patch where the game kind of feels unplayable. The delay in between guns feels so gross. 
I pulled out my pump to get this easy kill and it just wouldn't shoot so I swapped back to my AR, got a few shots off so pulled out the pump again... no shot. Dead. 
I'm not really sure why this was implemented, the game was silky smooth before and now it's clunky and slow. Why hurt your dedicated fanbase that took the time to learn the ins and outs of your game to cater to the newer players. 
If Epic wants a future in esports, this isn't the way to go. Look at league of legends, the biggest esports game on the market (for now). They buff and nerf depending on their competitive meta at the higher elo's. Their game would of died long ago if they buffed and nerfed by listening to the lower ranked players. Doesn't make any sense imo. 
Gun delay was a poor decision that affects the game much more drastically then they expected and I want to believe that epic will revert or at least make some changes.

I've started playing fortnite around the first of jan which is almost 4 months. My friend was the one who invited me to join so since i've started playing i've only been playing DUOS / SQUADS, I've never tried solo. I have around 1200 matches 98% of them are Duos and Squads. I remeber the first time i went solo was around 2 months since i started playing. I played a couple of matches then i retured to squads and duos again. 

The only time i've played solo is when the daily challange popped out on my screen so i had to play these 5 matches for the battlestars. Mostly evertime i landed i was like "" let me do this challange then ill suicide "" but i actually continued playing and clutched my first two wins.

Today i was playing solo for the same purpose which was doing the daily challanges and i just my third win. I've only played 65 solo matches and won 3 so it's a good ratio for me. I think what made me handle playing solo was playing too much squads and duos, you'll gain experience playing them facing different situations. 

TL;DR: Playing squads or duos for a long time before trying out solos will make you practice for such situations when you are playing alone.

Thanks for reading, I know this is my point of view and it's not accepted by everyone, It's just my story. ",FortNiteBR

How bad at the game are you that you’re complaining that people are using their weapons? What? And saying that the “double ramp rush” meta is cancer. If you’re the type of guy hiding in a base while I’m double ramping up, and offer no type of resistance before I kill you, you’re bad, plain and simple. Double ramp rush can be stopped by: A.) Ramp rushing to then to engage a build fight. B.) Shooting out their ramps. C.) Running away. People will find the dumbest things to cry about and blame their deaths on in this game. ",FortNiteBR

I was at work when the love ranger skin was on sale, so as I took a dump (as you do at work) I decided to quickly load up the app and buy it through there, as I couldn't get on my PC at home.

Basically, tapped the 10$ option, it said 'succesful', but no vbucks showed up. So I tried again, got an error. Tried again, got an error.

I then got the three emails saying the purchases were succesful, and my paypal coughed up the 30$ total. Since I didn't get any vBucks yet, I decided to just email Apple and say what went down.

Got home 4 hours later, got the refund issued from Apple. Logged on my PC to quicky buy the love ranger skin, and boom, 3K VBucks were there. Needless to say I started shitting bricks.

I immediately sent Epic Games a support email stating what happened, and asking them to remove the 3K Vbucks from my account.

I main PUBG but really want fortnite to be more playable/competitive.

For me fortnite games are not satisfying, since this game has attracted so many new players with no gaming background or no FPS history, as a player coming from CSGO and PUBG I can really tell most of the players cannot aim, do not know how to move and so on, while thats fine, I just dont think good players should be matched against them, its not fair and its not fun.

I suspect most people object to ranked since they enjoy blasting the noobs (which make up a good 60% of this player base).

In fact, I'd say that I get to at least Top 5 60% of the time these days. But still I only have one single solo win despite having played solo for over 1000 games.

My playstyle usually involves rushing any player I see with pump and tac shotgun. I don't use snipers since I can't aim. When the circle is small enough I build a small tower and try to stay out of combat until there's only two players left. This is where it always falls apart. I'm a pretty good shot with my dual shotguns, but without exception I fail to do any damage to the last player, I always get destroyed and my aim is all over the place whereas earlier in the game I had no trouble hitting people.

The last few patches for me have really sucked. First a few things were bugged which everyone hated but now with the delay on pump/swapping, guided missile, the gimmicky port-a-fort and even things as small as the reload sound effects changing I'm really enjoying the game less as pump/shotgun was my favourite playstyle as it was aggressive and I don't really like pump/smg).   
E: THE GODDAMN VENDING MACHINES. I absolutely despise the vending machines. The impact of a full squad getting early RPG's is stupid and that's coming from someone who plays primarily solo's where it's also stupid. The game didn't need more RPG's and more gold scars etc, it was perfectly fine the way it was imo. I don't like that people can craft their dream loadout right now if they get lucky and the final 1v1 is just fucking rpg's most of the time now since everyone has one. This was the first change that I really hated and I know many will disagree.    
I'm no God,  but I'm definitely not bad. I don't care about playing around new things but man it's just annoying.    
Seems like the game is getting easier and I don't really like it.  
Maybe it's that I played too much and got burnt out in combination with all this.

Fortnite is one of the only games where I've seen people frequently switch weapons mid fire, and obviously they do that to completely bypass the rate of fire on a weapon. This change effectively nerfs double pump and any double pump alternatives, which were frankly all pretty overpowered. 

*If Epic designs a weapon (like the pump shotgun) to have a cooldown inbetween shots of a given duration, they've chosen that specific duration to effectively balance the weapon.* When people quickly switch weapons mid firing, the main purpose has been to avoid and completely bypass firing restrictions. They're essentially using the cracks in the system to make weapons more overpowered than they are intended to be. 

There are some circumstances where it can actually be a legitimate problem, such as if you're sniping and someone sneaks up behind you and you have to switch to a shotgun, but it is not even close to the point of gamebreaking, and will still have a very small effect on the outcome of the fight. If you want to be able to switch weapons faster, you should use the tac shotgun, which has a faster fire rate and can start firing sooner after switching to it.

If you're in a fight with someone and you're using a pump shotgun, you should be using it because it has a high damage output and decent range while also accounting for the shite fire rate. When you use it that way, it is a balanced weapon relative to the other weapons. When you pick up two shotguns and switch between them frequently, you're trying to break the regulations set on one shotgun so that you can have a more op weapon, which, as I said earlier is not the intended purpose. 

Shotguns are probably the best weapons in the game. It's unreasonable to not carry one, let alone two at all times, and despite these recent changes, they are Still very powerful.",FortNiteBR

I personally don't like that the pump shotgun is a one shot kill at full health and shields but only to be more common found around the map than ammo itself. Practically there's more pumps on the map than any other weapon. 

The heavy and semi shotgun are truly enough but because the pump has a chance to one shot someone is where the all the outrage comes in. 

Personally ive never been a fan of shotguns throughout playing shooters just because they aren't prevalent like fortnite because usually you have a shotgun as a primary in most games with a weak sidearm and thats it.

The pump itself needs a damage nerf or something solely for it and not anything else. 

This to me is truly the only logical thing I could come up with. ",FortNiteBR

It's like Combat Pro but even better. Builder Pro doesn't change anything to the actual combat buttons, both layouts fight the same with the triggers to aim and shoot. It's where the building kicks in that makes it much faster and a useful tool to survive. 

In Combat Pro, having to switch between different platforms forces you to press L1 and R1 (LB and RB), causing you to raise your fingers away from the triggers, which are extremely important as they are your point and shoot, your fingers are always at rest on the triggers. In Builder Pro, the triggers are instant hotkeys to the most important platforms in the game, stairs and walls, meaning you don't need to raise your fingers and leave yourself exposed. Builder Pro is faster at protecting you in dire situations. 

Builder Pro also cuts the amount of button presses needed to switch and place platforms, something that new players and players under panic may encounter. Instead of accidently going right 3 times when you should have went left once (veterans Combat Pro players probably don't  experience), Builder Pro avoids this by having every single platform at a 2 button reach (once to select and again to place), or even 1 button if you simply hold down. 

The layout enhances the build aspect while keeping the shooting aspect as same as always. Epic and the Reddit community have created a better layout and it is unfortunately not the default. If every player was thrown into this new layout we would come across better teammates online and better fort battles being that building forts is much easier. What do you guys think? I know I'm really quick to hype up this new button layout in such short time but I really think it's the next evolution in Fortnite fundamentals. I wanna hear other opinions but I don't think I've jumped the gun. Anyone looking to get their building up should make the switch immediately and stick with it through the first few hours of headache. It's really worth it. 

TL;DR, Builder Pro is better than Combat Pro, should be the new standard of Fortnite buttons for consoles, really good if you wanna get your build game up and get that 200 IQ. ",FortNiteBR

As fortnite get larger and larger the game is minimizing the skill gap more and more.

Double pump was the first example of this, although it was very easy to use and was fairly powerful it was ""meta"" and most players of the good players adapted.

Then we got guided rocket, I dont think it's OP it's very difficult to deal with with a man down in squads against a reasonable team. Guided rocket isn't great in solos but when I'm playing squads going for a clutch 1v3 or its impossible and that seems to be the common opinion.

Now with this new update and the weapon swapping delay skill gap has GREATLY decreased. Like 5 rpg spam, yes it was good for a quick burst but with turbo building placing 1 wall every 25ms it was defendable, or build fights where you have them trapped edit a window but it takes an extended amount of time to fire off a shot.

Although these changes arent gamebreaking and the good players are still gonna come out on top I feel like it is ruining the skill gap. Switching guns like Tac to Deagle took a little bit of skill to pull off but now it's just better to stick with one gun. Or editing a window and pumping someone in the head quick takes way to long.

I think Epic gets a lot of hate they don’t deserve. Now, hear me out. 

There are bugs in this game but show me a game this popular where there isn’t. 

People get mad about the downtime. They say everyone should get vbucks or something because they couldn’t play a game. I got mad yesterday about the downtime but what did I do? I played another game. Its not gonna kill someone to not play a game for a couple hours. 

Most overreact about things added to the game. For instance, the guided missile launcher, vending machines, and port a fort. People are so quick to judge something before they can counter it. The guided missile got nerfed. The vending machine was a great thing to add into the game. The port a fort isn’t even op. It just stops people from building a base. Just build lol.

I’ve had my problems with fortnite. There are things I dislike about what Epic adds but I still continue to play. I just got John wick today and it felt good to complete the battlepass. 

People are gonna take this post as a joke but it’s not. I’m dead serious as I say and mean all these things. 

Employees of Epic are Human, not robots. They can’t do everything right on command. If they have to take the game down for a day, to get the game stable again, then let them.

I don’t get why it’s so hard for some of you to understand that the play style was way too rewarding with little to no drawbacks. You have a weapon capable of destroying somebody with one shot, that by itself has a delay already, and then you cancel into a weapon you can easily spam. You can’t do that anymore and that “lowers the skill gap”? Switching weapons doesn’t require skill lmao. Honestly, using double anything shows you lack skill. You need to abuse something to win.

The only thing i’ll agree with is the building to weapon or pick axe to weapon delay. That should go but I can live with it.

This is an idea that stemmed from being a long time veteran player of Magic: The Gathering/ MTGO and a bit of creative spice of my own. I'm also a Computer Science grad, so I tend to think in terms of practical implementation. 

That being said, I'd like to propose Leagues. Competitive Leagues &amp; Friendly Leagues. Daily and weekly leagues. 

League match-making would use an algorithm to group players by their kill/death and win ratio, in addition to their Battle Pass ranking. There could be a weekly league theme, such as Shotguns, Snipers, All Gold, etc. The winner of each first daily round of Battle Royal would then be paired up with the winners of the other matches, this could go on until the games get smaller and smaller until you finally have a 1v1. The winner of the friendly league would get some sort of green/blue cosmetic and a small amount of v-bucks or stars, where as the competitive league winner would get a purple or epic cosmetic and a larger reward. 

If the idea of leagues aren't your thing, maybe you could be on board with a sophisticated matchmaking algorithm that will allow Friendly &amp; Competitive lobbies, playing against players of your skill-level. 

What do you guys think? I really think this would be a win-win for casuals &amp; pros alike. We could even see competitive tournaments where the pros go head-to-head in various types of death matches. 

Heck, maybe even a Fortnite Hall of Fame filled with World Championship winners one of these days. ",FortNiteBR

This kills it for me. We can compare it to Combat Pro. In quick succession, you can place a roof ramp MUCH quicker than you can place stairs in the current Builder Pro.

As a result of this, my go-to react build (2 walls and a stair/roof ramp) is much slower on Builder Pro and it ISN'T because I'm not used to builder pro.

But why did they have to add the delay to switch to certain weapons after building/editing?



&amp;nbsp;



Epic really needs to understand that a big part of this game is that there are many DIFFERENT ways to play it. By creating the cooldown for specific weapons, especially after building and editing makes the game unsatisfying for EVERYONE who likes to build and edit to kill and play aggressively around it. Usually the people who took their time to master this playstyle have already invested a lot of time into this game and have taken building/editing for kills as the main way to get kills in the game. So 


&amp;nbsp;



It's like people who play aggressively don't get enough of a disadvantage in the first place, they have to put themselves out of position to push and block shots with buildings. Now they have to wait to shoot while the defender can shoot them right when they peek.

&amp;nbsp;

These are just some reasons why the new delay does not belong in this game. There are many more reasons, like, I've heard some people complain about the sniper and how it is harder to hit clutch shots with it no matter how good you are since there is a long delay when you switch to it and in that window of time your opportunity for a shot could've gone away.

First shot accuracy is bullshit that does not contribute to the game at all, and so is falloff. I know they were trying to fix an issue with falloff, but that issue is now even worse with first shot accuracy.

Also the editing. It is now impossible to quickly edit a wall and pump someone in the head like people like sypherpk did a lot before, the gun takes a fuck load of time to come out now and the other guy will most likely kill you first.

Also the switching is clunkier for absolutely no reason. Double heavy shotgun wasn't op, pump into tac shotgun wasn't op, and pump into tac smg wasn't op, I just don't get it.

Also, I think it's clear at this point that port a fort is generally a trash item no one wants in the game.

Well, what do all of these changes have in common? Well, they all reduce the skill ceiling of the game drastically, they all cater to the normie, casual audience of the game and hinder us skilled players. We can no longer do sick edit kills, we can no longer double heavy shotgun (which was not in any way op) and now the game is trying to help noobs build without having to actually learn to seriously build.

After this update, the game seems to unfortunately be heading in the direction of H1Z1, which is unfortunate because I love this game so much. Though not perfect, last week's patch was great, can we please go back to it and save this game?",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;
 
  
That aside, this game has blown up. Obviously.     

We clearly have more than enough players to support two different game queues.  Ranked play and Normal play.    
_(I base this by comparing to similar types of games that have both normal and ranked play with way less players than Fornite)_

&amp;nbsp;

  
Some of the most supported arguments against this were the following _(paraphrased from reading multiple comments from when this was a hot issue)_:  
  
1- ""Not enough players to support two different queues.""
  
2- ""Separating queues would decrease the fun level from one queue and force people into playing ranked only. ""
  
3- ""Part of what makes this game special is not knowing who your are playing against, and 
    playing vs better players will make you better too!.""

4- ""This game is not meant to be played competitively, too much rng, bloom doesn’t belong in competitive play""  
  
5- ""There is not enough interest in competitive play""  
  

&amp;nbsp;

I would like to offer some of my opinions on the matter.  
  &amp;nbsp;

1a.  
There is no question regarding this topic, we have the player base. Nothing to discuss here. We have more than enough.    
1b.  (proof to my 1a argument)
      
   
When the LTM (Limited time game modes)queues are out, I have never once experienced a single drop of numbers on the main queue nor have I ever experienced a longer wait time than I normally do to find a match.    
(Obviously this is pure anecdotal, but.. I play this game quite a a bit, so in theory I would be a good info source) 

&amp;nbsp;


    
2a.  
 I don't know about everyone else, but my definition of fun is not a CONSTANT never changing definition.    
Sometimes I'm up for a challenge and play strictly to win. I land off the main cities, I farm, I loot, I play the circle and play smart the whole time trying to win. Some days that's all I want to do... just try as hard as my heart desires ^^and ^^pretend ^^I'm ^^playing ^^in ^^a ^^tournament.    
  
 
 Other days, I just want to have fun[^^cue ^^Cyndi ^^Lauper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIb6AZdTr-A&amp;t=0m38s).   
Build massive forts, clear out entire towns with my pickaxe, go for crazy funny toP MlG DoRitOS MtN DeW 360 no scope plays... you name it, just playing for fun.   
  
If I get a W out of it... __GREAT, icing on the cake.__  

I personally can see my self enjoying the possibility of having two separate queues where I know I will expect players to be playing at their max potential in one mode, and a queue where people may or may not just be there having fun, practicing, or learning the game.   
  
&amp;nbsp;


3a.  
True, that part of the game is special, but so is every other online game ever made. You never know who you will be playing against, you could be playing vs the Next Faker... that's no excuse to not have a different queue, Faker could be playing normals^^and^^losing ^^^^mid ^^^^to ^^^^a ^^^^gold4 ^^^^brand
  
3b.  
I feel however, that at a certain point that is not such a good thing.   
There are games where I'm not even trying and still stomp 8+ players without breaking a sweat..._(not saying this to sound like a badass, I promise)_ to the point sometimes where I kinda feel bad for them, it's really not fair for them.   
  
They are definitely not even close to the same skill level others and I are playing on.   
 
I know if I were to take up a new game, I would not want to be super stomped every game like that... because I would honestly feel like trash, and it would not be fun for me __at all.__  
3c.  
  
Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that playing versus better players is bad, actually I'm a firm believer that playing people of higher caliber helps you improve a lot, __but not when the skill gap is this wide.__    
I'll use League of Legends for example(again)  
  
A Bronze 5 player will not learn much by playing vs a Diamond/Master player.
However,  he/she can definitely benefit from playing versus Silver and Gold players (even then they would be at a pretty significant disadvantage)  
  
I think the same concept could be applied to Fortnite.   
  
We are growing, there are people getting better every day, there are people starting out for the first time every day... there are plenty of veterans that are on a league of their own (see ninja, Myth, Daequan... and TONS of unknown players that are just as good as them and __BETTER TOO__    

So I feel we are at a place where we need to start introducing some kind of skill based match making.  (At the very least have a matchmaking based on number of games played, so brand new player is not just stomped to boredom)  
&amp;nbsp;

  
4a.    
Eh, that's really just a matter of opinion, isn't it? 
This game is based on RNG at the very first drop true... but that's the nature of the game. We know what we are getting into...  
  
At least Epic has been going towards the right direction in terms of shooting mechanics, the first shot accuracy has been welcomed very well by the majority _(basing this on not seeing multiple front page posts demanding for it to be removed, and feedback from the communities I'm part of too)_  
&amp;nbsp;

  
5a.  
Maybe that was then...   
There are multiple communities now hosting daily ""snipes games"" some of them with weekly tournaments (prized and not prized)  
 
I know of 10+ different discord communities with 1000+ members each (Some from different region servers too, the Latin America and Europe server have some decent communities looking to play competitive games)  

There are sites that have cash bet tournaments too.  
    
and these are being done WITHOUT A PRIVATE KEY  
  
It's a very primitive type of competitive play_(where we all hit play at the same time and pray to the Epic gods to thrown as many of us possible together in the same match)_ but we do with what we have...   
  
The moment Epic releases private keys... I feel this game will have a second ""popularity explosion""   


&amp;nbsp;


  
So please, I encourage everyone to have an open mind and engage on some civil discussion on the matter.  
^^or ^^reddit ^^be ^^reddit ^^and ^^tell ^^me ^^to ^^go ^^choke ^^on ^^a ^^big ^^fat ^^^~~slurp~~ ^^^~~juice~~

Epic put [this](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/extended-instability-and-downtime-4-11) out today and stated that BR players would be getting both a free back bling, and would receive free tiers to help with their battle passes next week. 

I think this is pretty unfair to people who have maxed their battle pass, especially those who didn’t buy tiers and grinded everyday to level up and get challenges done. I think the fairest way to even this out would be to give *only people who already have their battle pass maxed out,* the equivalent in V-Bucks to the number of tiers everyone else will be getting for free. 

For example, if they give out 5 free tiers, players with maxed battle passes should receive 750 V-Bucks (150 x 5). 

Before people start commenting saying “oh, you just have your battle pass maxed already and want free V-Bucks.” Well, yes, pretty much. Doesn’t really seem fair to me that I worked hard to max my battle pass out as soon as possible and now some people are getting a free x-tiers boost while I get nothing (aside from the back bling).

TL;DR: players with maxed battle passes should receive the V-Buck equivalent of however many tiers Epic is giving to everyone else for free.",FortNiteBR

The people was cool with that, and quickly adapted to the new changes by choosing weapons of different kind (Pump &gt; Tac; Pump &gt; SMG etc), because people could opt for other options. 

Last patch (v3.5) introduced changes to weapon swapping. Deleting almost every possibility to swapping weapons in course to dealing more damage and playing more effectively and efficiently. Many not popular weapons that could benefit from this perk were also thrown to the dumpster with this nerf, giving almost no possibility to do stylish great plays from more skilled players with any weapon and even making the game feel more clunky. 

High skill ceiling is very beneficial for game because it maintains every kind of people in the game, high skilled and low skilled: The skilled ones, even though they represent a very low percentage of the players, are very, VERY important for the game since they are the ones that do all the crazy stuff in the game and make it interesting and fun, plus they are the last ones who abandon a game when they're skilled enough so you can get fun by trying to imitate or watching them play, low skilled will always represent the much higher percentage and these one are the people who maintain the game active, the problem with low skilled and casual people is that they will always abandon the game as soon the ""next game"" comes or the hype dies, which is always inevitable yet it can be radically slowed by maintaining the high skilled players in the game. If high skilled people leave the game the hype dies way faster, low skilled will leave and this what really hurts a game, low playerbase and stalled fun factor. And appealing to the low skilled and/or casual players has affected great franchises like Halo, Rainbow Six and most notably Destiny. 

Epic has handled other issues amazingly well, when rocket ride was discovered, it looked silly and people underestimated the power of this strategy, yet Epic decided to make it a thing and look how many videos, plays and fun people has had with this absurd yet effective strategy. Fortnite BR has reached r/All with rocket ride videos, and the players are willing to try it and risk just so they can do an insane and it would worth it. 

Please Epic Games, I'm not saying that the changes to be reverted, but at least give other options instead of cutting some of the best aspects of the game.

You CANNOT build higher than a port a fort before the person edits a wall and shoots you.

Who needs build battles when someone can just spam pre made BS.


Guided Missile: Im fairly certain that the guided missile is ""bugged""  so they can work on it some more without admitting to the community that it was a shit idea. 

In a 1v1 its manageable. But if you are fighting someone else, and suddenly a rogue missile from a 3rd guy comes in, its just really annoying to drop everything you are doing to sit in a box for a few seconds.

It needs to be wire guided with the camera staying with the player rather than chase cam following it around corners.

Pump Timer: I cant really remember anyone asking for this, or even suggesting it. The shotguns, apart from the obvious inconsistencies, were pretty good where they were after the double pump removal, so why they have to go and nerf any decent player who likes to edit, and then one bang someone with a pump, which was really fun and satisfying, is beyond me. 


I feel like the game is going away from where A: the majority of the community want it to be. and B: where the best players think the game should go. one the one hand you have great additions like the launch pad and impulse grenades (there should be more of both), to things like nerfed trees, free kill guided missiles, Instant 3x3 towers, and 1/3 of the games population dying in 30 seconds because of tilted towers. Which really needs switching places with like junk junction and toning down a bit. The game is just not as fun as it used to be where you could drop literally anywhere and get non stop action constantly until the end of the game.

Please instead focus on how the weapon delay affects YOU. Your opinion and how you feel about it is perfectly valid no matter if your win rate is 3% or 30%. You don't have to prove your voice matters by pontificating about skill gaps or who Epic is catering to.

I love seeing people talk about how clunky and unresponsive the game feels because that's a great point to make and is the main reason I myself don't support this change. One of the things Fortnite had going for it was how smooth the controls felt when you got a handle on them. Part of that smooth feel is *objectively* gone now. Focus on that and I think Epic will hear us out!",FortNiteBR

For actual measurement, here is what I am witnessing and I have recorded a few instances because to me there is no explanation other than a cheat of some kind is happening. 

On Dusty Depot my chute pulls about 5 wall lengths up from the top of the depot. As I'm falling I look around or straight down at the depots as I aimed right at the floor level of the depots but still got auto pulled way early. In my time falling i have seen: multiple people pull directly at the level of the roof of the depot. One person navigate towards the door of the depot and pull their chute *literally at the door of the depot*. I saw several people not have their chute pull until they were only 2 or 3 wall lengths above the ground.

What we get now is new bugs every day / servers down because you add 10 new weapons / functionalities / gameplay changing content. 

The game has to evolve, but stop changing it every day please or people will just abandon like they did with other games that kept changing gameplay everyday. I really like the game but you just keep decreasing the skill cap with each new update, making the game noob friendly. What  are people supposed to learn  once they ""git gud"". Really I'm just waiting for a auto-aim automatic rifles now. 

I have spent so many hours on the game (same with $$) and I enjoy it less and less with every new ""new player friendly"" updates these bring game breaking bugs (weapons dropping, being unable to edit buildings).

Another thing. The amount of people complaining this is because of all the updates and that is why the game is down- you are wrong. Firstly, in case you didn’t know, they stated their update schedule is changing, with content updates every two weeks and bug fixes in between. They do listen, and this patch is a MASSIVE step, the amount of patches in it is unbelievable, console players gameplay just got upgraded to a whole new level; and now everyone is back to *complaining* again. You all act so entitled. Secondly, it isn’t a Fortnite error, hence why this update didn’t cause it, it’s the entire Epic Games server, meaning games such as Paragon are down for example. 
For those asking for compensation, yes I expect you will receive 20 battle starts like the last tine this happened. I would view this as more than you should get in fact, because you (probably) didn’t lose 2 tiers because of this, challenges stack. 

Please, all lay off Epic for once and be patient. I cannot imagine the amount of stress the employees are in currently with their games crashing everywhere. Think of the players they are losing to this. Wait it out, I’m sure we can all do without Fortnite for a day.

The shotgun is literally the only skilled thing about this game weapon wise. Everything else is completely RNG. 

Literally EVERY single weapon in the game except the shotgun and sniper are RNG. They all have bloom and aren’t aim reliant at all. 
                                                                                     

The reason that players need two shotguns is because without two shotguns you would NEVER win a close encounter single shotgun fight in this game. 

There would be ZERO reason to even run a shotgun. 

A single shotgun is extremely underpowered by itself. The fire rate is horrible and any other gun would completely overpower it after the first shot. I don’t get how a vast majority of players don’t understand that. 

There is obviously a reason on why all of the skilled players/streamers that all of the casual people look up to run two shotguns. How is it hard to comprehend that in your brain. 

EVERY SINGLE WEAPON has bloom. Casual idiots nonstop spam explosives having 20+ rockets in a close encounter fight. You won’t see the majority complain about that though because its the biggest clutch for shit players. It’s because they aren’t able to use anything else against a good player. 


The skilled players literally get shit on EVERY SINGLE update and casual players are completely blind to that which blows my mind.


You agree with it because you are casual gamers. This weapon delay is literally game breaking for a huge amount of people. But of course lets cater to the players who are completely shit at the game because its the majority of the playerbase and epic wants to produce as much income as possible. Lets just remove the weapon skill gap pretty much completely at this point. Lets make it rely on spray rng bloom fights that have nothing to do with consistent good aim at all. ",FortNiteBR

I don’t feel the need to link to threads where I criticized him here, but I had a laundry list of beefs I had against him. Largely my criticism was that I felt he was a bad influence on all the kids watching him and also a lot of Fortnite streamers. I felt that he was contributing to a pretty big amount of toxicity surrounding the game and those who stream it.

It’s time for an update on this! I’m sure Ninja never saw any of the things I said, but he may have heard other people making similar critiques of his behavior. It’s also possible that the exposure from Drake made him rethink some of his behavior as well. Either way, I need to give him props. He’s a different person lately, and I’m noticing some huge ripple effects from it.

I don’t see nearly the amount of trash talking from him, accusing other players of stream sniping or cheating, or calling other people trash. He’s behaving a lot more like Myth or some smaller streamers like Dead Squirrel who are much more respectful and kind.

Ninja has a pretty huge sphere of influence, and I’ve noticed people like Wildcat have cut back a lot of the toxicity that I think they picked up from Ninja. I really appreciate Ninja for taking his responsibility and influence more seriously. I’m subscribed to him on Twitch and YouTube now because I feel a.) he’s displaying more behavior that I don’t mind supporting and b.) he’s more enjoyable to watch.

They’ve released things like the Easter and raven skins, shuttle glider, and even brought back the electro shuffle and jubilation for a day. On Sunday, April 8th, 2018, they dropped the “Wiggle”: a cute little number where your character performs a side-to-side shimmy and taps their hips while they shake their booty. My friends and I immediately fell in love. I invested my first-ever funds into the game and purchased it because I felt it paired amazingly with my skin of choice, the female Moonwalker (aka Miss Thickums, because her body is like an air-tight, succulent marshmallow).

Loading into our first ever game with the “Wiggle”, my squad and I had all agreed we’d land somewhere less-popular so we could have a little fun and test out our recent purchases. The battle bus’s track was slashing directly east to west on the far south side of the map over Fatal, so we agreed we’d go Junk Junction. To our surprise, one squad actually landed with us, but we got to the guns first and secured the elims. My buddy with his brand-new (“authentically-acquired!”) John Wick skin got an admittedly-sick, white-pump triple elim and bragged about how the Wick skin grants him “like a +3 damage boost”. I let him have his moment since I didn’t really have the heart to tell him that it’s actually only a 0.5 attack buff in addition to a pedestrian 0.15 elusive multiplier and subpar 0.75 defense increase (ever since the slight-nerf that came with the vending machine update).

Anyways, after we pillaged Junk, we headed toward Haunted Hills since the storm circle’s edge was near tilted. Near the outside of Hills, I spotted what was a player-made makeshift wood bunker with an extinguished cozy campfire inside. “This seems fresh...,” I warned my squad. “Keep your head on a swivel.” I’m the squad’s scout, so I’m an expert when it comes to player tracking. Footsteps, footprints, traps and junk. I track all of that.

Slowly but surely, we entered the Hills. John Wick buddy, per usual, jumped ahead of us and zipped through Hills with his youtube-style ramp building, rambling on about how “there’s no time to check Hills, you cucks”. But, it looked virtually untouched. You could hear a chest chime coming from almost every burial house in the cemetery. We HAD to give it a quick run-through. As we looted, our suspicions that arose from the fresh cozy campfire gradually left our minds. Between the three of us, we found two blue ARs and a purple scar. It was quite the fruitful haul.

Since the storm was about to start rolling in, my buddies Matt and Michael went on ahead as I checked the last spot: the ruined church. I was feeling a lil brazy since I had a medkit. Sadly, there was nothing in the church itself, but I heard a chest under the floorboards where the coffin is so I popped down that little hole in the corner of the room and moved toward the chest. It was at this moment that things turned very, very rotten.

Before I could react, I spotted two C4 bombs behind the coffin and they immediately blew me to smithereens. Once the smoke cleared, I saw a squad of 3 raven-skinned goons and a burnout skin hop the metal fence and begin to collect the loot from the chest. They were slightly distracted because the chest yielded a Gold homing-launcher, and they were debating on who was YouTube-good enough to pick it up for their stream I presume- so I used this time to slink away and hide behind a tombstone while I waited for Matt and Michael to come back and rescue me. It was night time out so I thought maybe I could effectively allude them.

Once I had gotten behind the tombstone. I actually thought I had a chance. Footsteps shuffled all around me but they hadn’t been able to spot me. But then... I heard it. The bass from the “Wiggle” kicked up. On one side of the tombstone, I was met with an abnormally bodacious Raven that was packing a huge chub. He waved it at my face. Following him shortly to the other side of the tombstone was another Raven skin. This one’s pecker was larger then the others’ pecker- which is odd, because I thought that all skins were identical. Beaks must be a design flaw. He was rubbing his feathery, smelly corduroy’s on top of my space helmet as he simultaneously wiggle danced and locked hands with his Raven partner on the other side. It‘s just something about this dance. Suh-something... sinister. I get the chills just thinking about it. As I sit hunched over on my bathtub floor with the lights off while lukewarm shower water runs down my backside at a low pressure and “Hurt You” by The Weeknd plays, recalling to you my narrative, I become incredibly uneasy even thinking about the “Wiggle”, load-in music, the red notification that pops up when you eliminate someone... Fortnite itself.

I heard a missile fire off and then the burnout skin jumped in front of me, pushing me closer and closer to the tombstone. I assumed he was their leader. He closed his eyes tightly and gyrated his sloppy, smelly tongue in a drill-like motion towards my face like someone who had never kissed a human outside their family before. His body stumbled toward mine, and he began to “Wiggle” as well. All three of them pinned me up against the tombstone and ravaged my body with their gelatin hips. The homing missile that had fired before was circulating the scene, capturing all angles of this heinous act. The nerf for the missiles hadn’t come out yet either, so the footage was HD quality. The stream viewers could probably see the tears rolling down my cheeks and the dump in my pants as I was rocked and rocked again by these new-aged cyber gangsters. Once the homing-missile blew up, the last Raven of the squad hopped on top of the tombstone and had begun to “Make it Rain” on me. As my health fell in the 20’s, my consciousness began to go. I would stare out onto the sea as my limp body continued to be pummeled into the coarse tombstone until I eventually was blue-pumped in the face by Burnout and put out of my misery.

It’s been almost 4 days since I’ve played Fortnite, and I can say I’m honestly unsure if I’ll be able to go back to playing. I can’t stop crying. I receive messages daily from the gooks that Wiggle-whipped me.
“lol hey bb ready for round 2?”
“lmaoooo miss thickums, what up??” 
“Squads?”
“I cant stop thinking about u :)” 
And you know what the worst part about it all? I can’t even enjoy Fornite hentai anymore. As someone who has transcended traditional intercourse (human-on-human), I have been strictly cyber-on-human intercourse for quite some time now, and ever since Fornite had come out, it’s really the only thing I’ve been able to effectively pleasure myself to. Often times I would just go into the lobby and admire the butt-to-thigh lift on female Moonwalker. But, since the incident... I’m like a tub of horse radish that got thrown into the freezer. I can’t please Deborah, my wife who is a XEight180 Hyper-Sleep Pleasure doll and she’s already threatening me with couples therapy.

To make an analogy, you're making this game too much like COD and not enough like CSGO or DOTA in the idea that players need to put in time and effort to get good and this is all thanks to the higher skill cap, allowing us to distinguish from rookie, below average, average, above average, semipro, and pro. With a lower skill cap it'll just start to look like rookie, average, and pro.

This theory is absolutely stupid.,"This is just a case of confirmation bias, and it's a ridiculous part of the theories flying around relating to the meteor. Talk about looking for connections where there are none.

 Retail lines up with Warsaw, and Tilted with Poznan? If these POI's are references to real world locations, why would Tilted (Poznan) be bigger than Warsaw (Retail)? Warsaw has more than triple the population of Poznan. 

Warsaw is known as a center of retail? Warsaw is the largest city in Poland! It's their capitol! It's one of the major world cities! The same could be said for any major city. I could also say Warsaw is known for its arts or sciences. Both are true! There is nothing specific to retail that merits equating Warsaw with Retail.

Haunted Hills is supposed to represent the military cemetery in Szczecin? Haunted Hills was a user suggestion from THIS subreddit. Epic didn't even come up with the idea. Szczecin is also a major city. Why would it be represented ONLY by a cemetery?

These are the main places I've seen that supposedly ""match up"". Let's talk about the ones that don't.

Moisty Mire: Located in the southeast of the map. The southeast of Poland is not known for any significant swamp. In fact it's a hilly region ~ 300m above sea level.

Lucky Landing: Again, no parallel in real life southern Poland. There are no port cities, as there is no water for there to be a port. There is also no significant center of casinos (or a significant Asian population.)

Shifty Shafts: There are no major mines in this region of Poland. There are some that would line up better with Flush Factory, and Greasy Grove, but even then, not really.

Snobby Shores: There is no town or urban center with a particularly affluent reputation in this region of Poland. This is also a part of the country located far from the sea.

Loot Lake: There is no large lake in this area of Poland. In fact not even remotely close.


The Poland theory is ridiculous, and does not hold up to speculation. Let's all agree to remove this element from our various meteor conspiracy theories.

**EDIT**: I'd also like to say, we have **NO** evidence that the meteor will strike Tilted Towers. The theory that this is where it would strike started as a joke that picked up steam.

 The original ""Morse code"" post was on *APRIL FOOLS DAY*. No other user has confirmed that the vibrations actually match up. 

Epic has already stated that the controller vibrations were a bug.

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8815lf/vibrating_controllers_console/

Sure, maybe they were trying to mislead their fanbase. 

Except:

This bug has been *FIXED* already for Christ's sake. 

https://trello.com/c/BdnU2SJx/100-random-controller-vibrations

When the meteor strikes, I'm willing to bet it will result in an entirely new map for Season 4 (Epic has already said that one will be coming eventually, and they now have enough players that they could fill lobbies even if they're split between two map choices.)

Second Edit: Don't y'all go judging how I choose to procrastinate at work. This is fun for me.

We get it, QA cant catch everything because there are so many things that are so situational/rarely happen. Why not put out a PTR Mode. This would be under the LTM and would allow people to go and try out the new weeks items/weapons but allow masses to test out the new game version for bugs. Something like this will be so much better for the game in that:

It allows the community to help make the transition to new versions much smoother by ensuring any game breaking glitches are identified early.

It allows you to receive community input on what you are implementing before it goes live and harder to overturn/fix. I.e sentiment on Guided Missile and this pretty poor lazy fix with weapon swap delays.

Overwatch has this sort of PTR test mode and it works well for them. They have had issues with getting enough people but here at Epic there are many ways to motivate people to join in. Some, yes would not need any incentive and would just wanna help out, but for those who need a little extra push **Warning Trigger Alert** you could offer some exclusive items(banners/skins/etc) or maybe V-Bucks. But that doesn't have to be necessary. V-Bucks would be something like 10 V-Bucks for every 1 hour spent in PTR for example. Though i would spend 50hours in PTR if that would get me an exclusive Detective skin or something.

All in all i think a PTR server could really improve these patch transitions, as I've noticed the community sentiment is starting to turn a little toxic when it comes to this topic.",FortNiteBR

TLDR at bottom. I played the game for 5 minutes and everything feels so much slower and clunkier. It is honestly unplayable and weapons like the sniper are ruined for me. I would love to hear an explanation for why adding clunkiness to the game is the best way to handle a nerf. I can understand why epic would not want us to quickswitch between shotguns but snipers? Assault rifles? 
Even after editing a building it takes 2 days to pull out my gun and shoot the person.
Aggressive players like me now have to completely change their playstyle due to this change and defensive players(mostly noobs) are benefiting.
After adding the clunkiness aspect to the game it ruined the past paced fights in fortnite that I loved and kept me interested. Mid game is already slowpaced enough why add more aspects to the game that make it slow.

Almost every single pro player/streamer I watch has said they hated this feature: dakotaz saying ""im sorry but i dont think i can use the sniper anymore, it takes 2 days to pull out."" You cant even destroy someones wall in their fort and quickswitch into a sniper to get a quick kill anymore. Epic why?

Overall, I dont believe this is the path Epic should take towards creating a competitive game and catering towards slower players and lowering the skill cap of the game is not a good idea. This patch has killed the game for me and I dont have fun playing it anymore due to the clunky feel of the game.

Thank you if you read my rant lol. 
Tldr;
Adding clunkiness to switching weapons has ruined the past paced features of fortnite that I loved. Lowering the skill cap of the game is not the right direction imo. Aggressive players now forced to play defensively to accommate for the lower skill cap.",FortNiteBR

Fornite could then also add bundles for certain amounts of time &amp; also have new packs for every season e.g an Easter Pack ( gauranteed Easter item) Christmas pack, Halloween pack! (You get the idea.)

Now, I remember seeing a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8a07i3/epic_will_always_push_for_new_content_instead_of/) on this Reddit warning of us constant changes by Fortnite and the addition of new content instead of actually fixing underlying issues within the game. In this thread, OP also stated that Epic Games were notorious for adding:

&gt;New items  
&gt;  
&gt;Unwanted balance changes

and according to /u/Fruitmasterflex, these changes "" just didn't make sense and broke the game even more.""

Finally, I must add a comment that I seen from the original thread warning us of this, by /u/The_Superfirst who stated: 

&gt; Part of what killed Paragon was that the major patches woukd completely change the way the game was played. Each time they performed a complete rework, they lost a chunk of the playerbase that preferred a previous iteration.

TLDR: Epic Games making game\-changing updates every patch, ruining fast\-paced play\-styles such as Daequan to give slower players a chance. Paragon took same path; meta\-changing every patch which lost a &amp;#37; of their playerbase everytime.",FortNiteBR

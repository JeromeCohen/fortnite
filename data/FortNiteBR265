I don’t play Fortnite super often. I’m a normie with the regular dance. I was just running around in Solo in a shopping cart having fun when I got stuck in Loot Lake and someone named Streamer {302} found me. I have no idea who they were, but instead of killing me they hopped in my shopping cart, and our adventures began.

They had a cool skin and so many emotes, clearly they were much better at Fortnite than I but that didn’t matter. We rode up and down the hills, with me pushing them along while they danced the whole way. I couldn’t believe that someone I found in Fortnite Solo wasn’t going to try to kill me and would join me on my shopping cart adventure. Eventually we got to Dusty Divet, where they gave me shield potions and made a Porta Fort with me.

However, our fun was not to last. A player by in an American bear outfit found us. Despite Streamer {302}’s expert building, we were slain. I couldn’t add Streamer {302}, obviously, but I wanted to thank them for our great time together dancing and riding around in our cart.

Wherever you are- thank you, Streamer {302}. I hope all you on r/FortNiteBR have had similar experiences. And even if you never see this Streamer {302}, I hope you know you made my day.

With SMGs you can spray and pray and still melt quick. I honestly think it was casual players who complained about double shotguns because they couldn’t manage to do it themselves, it was a skill to play consistently well with them. I know there are going to be people saying I’m bad cause I “needed” double shotty, but that’s just not true. I already have plenty of wins in S5 and I still play well, I just think the game was more enjoyable with double shotguns. I think atleast pump-tac should’ve stayed unchanged.",FortNiteBR

1. Change it from blue rarity/drop rate to purple rarity/drop rate, it's simply too strong to be found so frequently, I find it more often than I do grenade launchers/rockets and it's just as powerful (if not more powerful) against people building.
2. Reduce the max stack limit to 4. As it is right now you can carry 9 (fairly certain it's 9), I know that's a pretty drastic cut but right now late game being able to have 9 C4 only take up one inventory slot is crazy, I know people wanna carry it and use it but this way they'll either A. need to be smarter about when they use it or B. sacrifice an extra inventory slot to carry more.
3. Reduce the amount that drop to stacks of 2.

The overall goal with these ideas is to keep C4 where it is (since that probably won't change) but force people to be smarter with it instead of being able to C4 spam later in the game, and if they still want to spam it that's fine but it'll cost them multiple inventory slots.

I would love to see finishing downed enemies strongly discouraged through a few possibilities:

1. Heavily increase a downed players health to make it more time consuming to eliminate.
2. Start a downed player with 1000 health and exponentially increase bleed out with time.
3. Make the downed player invincible.

In my eyes, there is only one acceptable reason for finishing off a downed enemy - to get their loot: I would propose the ability to ""strip search"" a downed enemy. Similar to opening an air-drop or pinata, you could search the enemy and have them drop all their loot, or bring up a menu and grab what you need.

I started playing in season one. I’m not a rockstar by any means but do have 400-500 wins. Here’s some issues that a extremely toxic to the game and is rubbing lots of people the wrong way. 

•I don’t enjoy the spray gun meta as it takes no skill to do. Lots of players I kill are better than me all around but couldn’t withstand the spray meta, this doesn’t have to be done with the minigun, I do it with LMG’s, 3 drumguns since they are so common. This is the easiest it’s ever been for me to get wins. People will give ideas on how to counter it or say “git gud” or “adapt” but when you have this method down good, it’s hard to counter and I win my gunfights a huge majority of the time and almost 100% of the time vs shotgun users because the swap delay and low DPS.

•The new meta is a huge nerf to materials. Not in the sense that you farm slower or it takes more time to get maxed materials that it use to, but In the sense that the spray meta burns through them a lot quicker than the shotgun meta could ever get close to. That’s why when you kill someone, they have no mats and you’re farming in the last few circles.

•This is where I get really confused. Epic wants to discourage camping. It started with the ghost peek nerf, then they buffed explosives(C4 and grenade launcher) and added in the stink bomb. So they discourage passive gameplay that way. THEN on the other foot, they deincentivize going for kills by nerfing materials and having low XP for kills... so I have no idea what they are doing right now in that aspect.

Final thoughts: I want a version of the shotgun meta back or some of the spray guns removed, it was more fun when you could build battle and out maneuver. Now I just go through your builds by spraying especially since you can phase through walls. I know some of you new players like to bash on vets by saying “if you’re that good just adapt”, well I have adapted and it’s not fun for anyone involved and when people start picking up on this, it won’t be fun for you either. This is just not healthy for the game.

I bought the 59.99 vbuck package on july 12th, 6:40pm according to the email from sony I got. This was right as the servers crashed. I wasnt able to login for hours after this. Sitting in the queue forever. 

I didnt I noticed receive the vbucks, I thought whatever itll show up on a reboot. It didnt. I saw on Twitter others were having an issue too so I waited until the next day and contact sony. Live chat, they made me do the restore license and deactiactivate and reactivate my ps4 as primary. Didnt work. They said that they added the license to my account and that it should work and I needed to contact the publisher. 

So I email them with all the info they need. NO ANSWER FOR 2 MORE DAYS. So before that, I was mad. Falling behind on the battlepass etc... so I do another purchase on july 14th and send epic back a response saying to cancel the original and refund my money. 

That's where it gets ********, this guy named callum immediately sends me back a email saying that epic can only refund purchases on PC and I needed to deal with sony for that. So I get back on chat with sony and they see I've already been in contact with them and tell me they would not refund my purchase and that it's a valid transaction and I needed to go ti epic to figure it out. Now I'm heated with the ring around. I tell them the easy solution is to dispute the charge on my credit card due to them not honoring the purchase and was told immediately that while that would get me the money back that I would be banned. So I ask, so you're gonna ban my account because I disputed a purchase that hasnt been honored? He confirmed yes and sent me to the policy and terms. 

I email epic back and callum responds TWO more days later saying that I'm to goto sony with all refunds. I said forget the refund. Just give me the vbucks. He says in a response 4 minutes later that I am not in the computer system and the purchase cant be verified. 

So one last time I get back on sony, they due jack **** and push me out the door. They did give me a transaction I'd. Number and I sent that back to this Callum guy whopick and chooses when to respond while offering no recourse and asking questions like what and where this purchases was made so we can solve this. 

That leaves me at thus moment waiting on a response. What is going on? What else or how else do I go about this? Epic should know by doin the math that I didnt receive them. It's been 6 days total.

I'm an avid Fortnite player who, since I began playing in season 3, have bought all of the battle passes (including season 5), and have purchased V-Bucks and skins from the item store. I have been playing on PC for most of this time, but recently decided to change. My laptop is not powerful, and so I sought to have a better Fortnite experience by buying an Xbox One. However, when I tried to connect my Epic Games account to the xbox, I was barred from playing. This is because I logged in on a friend's Playstation to play Fortnite last week. I know that I should have known that it would block me from playing on Xbox, but I didn't realise such a block was a thing until it happened to me. My complaint ticket to Epic was replied with simply an automated message. I know I am liable for this mistake, but is it possible for Epic to transfer my skins and V-Bucks to my Xbox-linked Epic account, and terminate my old one? I'm so sorry that I'm resorting to Reddit, but I am a student, who tried to support a game he loves and ended up losing items that he invested a great deal of time and money into.

What I mean by that is that people just spray buildings and spam explosives. RPGs and Grenade Launchers have continued to be some of the strongest weapons, and the ammo nerf has barely done anything to stop the spamming. C4s are still extremely broken with their blast radius. The only explosives in a good spot are clingers and grenades because they at least promote some skill.

With the double shotgun nerf, shotgun SMG is the new meta. That combo was already the strongest in the game (especially after the first shotgun nerf where they can’t destroy buildings in one shot and the pump delay). The new SMG is a straight up a spray and pray gun, having a higher DPS than the Tac, but also higher rate of fire. Silenced SMGs might just be the best gun in the game, having next to no recoil and a high DPS. Drum Guns have a high magazine which makes them heavy favorites for spraying.

Getting mats have been hard enough and buildings are just getting shredded. So the only real mechanic that makes this game unique, is getting weaker because of the direction the meta is taking.

Epic talked about introducing or promoting different play styles, and this season just shows that they’re failing. There’s no diversity in playstyles or guns used whatsoever. It’s just spray buildings or blow everything up.",FortNiteBR

Hey everyone! I wanted to bring you some information on drift and the storyline! So, each loading screen from the Road Trip challenge has a sentence about Drift. The first loading screen, Road Trip!, has the description, ""What better place to start than a giant hilltop burger? We convinced a new friend to join as well."" From those first 2 sentences we can tell that this Rex, Cuddle Team Leader, and Brite Bomber are going on a trip. They start at the Durr Burger and found Drift here. They convinced him to go on the trip with them and became friends with them. I think that over the next 6 weeks each loading screen will tell this story about drift and maybe will have some clues to who the skin is. Anyway, the next loading screen is in the files and I will show it to you now: (Spoiler Alert) [https://imgur.com/a/w8ZgJEa](https://imgur.com/a/w8ZgJEa) Now the title of this loading screen is Fairway Fun and the description is: ""We hit the links and invented some new rules for golf. They mostly involved driving around really fast."" This is just more of the story and really doesn't do much other than be a middle part of the story. I think that as we go on it might get more useful and will contain suspenseful stuff. One thing to add is that they are written in the past tense which means this already has happened. This could mean that the Road Trip character is the 5th member, maybe who took the pictures, and is telling us the story. Tomorrow, when the new challenges come out, I will look out in the files for week 3 loading screen which just has TBD in the description and title. (This applies to all the rest of them) Another thing I will add is that currently, there are only 7 loading screens in the files. This may mean we might get 7 rather then 8 like with the blockbuster but, the 8th loading screen was in a different place then the rest of them.

After playing about 10 matches, I got so angry, I uninstalled Fortnite. Then a few weeks later I was having a party, so I decided to let people play games and shit on my TV and PC. I reinstalled it (all 26GB) and then starting playing.

I think they should try a system where building has a stamina or cool down after a certain number of materials used. For anyone that plays Save the World this would work similar to how Energy does, except instead of abilities using Energy just building will use it. For people that don’t know I will do my best to explain.  

Let’s say we start out with 100 Energy at the beginning of the game. Every time we put down a building piece, maybe the Energy can go down by 1 or 2 ticks at a time (exact numbers would have to be tested to find a good fit, just bear with me here). Once we run out of Energy we can no longer build. However, there will be two ways to regain Energy. The first would be after a certain amount of time we start to regain it whether it starts out slow and speeds up the more we don’t build or if it is a constant regen rate starting maybe 10 seconds of not building. The other would be doing damage to players. Maybe however much damage we do to a player will give that much Energy back (up to 100) or at least be scaled to a certain amount. This will encourage players to focus on the gunfight more so than the “build fight.” Therefore, it will keep players from having the ability to build and build and build without once thinking about shooting their gun.  

As I said all the numbers would definitely take quite a bit a testing to be balanced, but I think once they are, it will make for a better balance in the game between shooting and building. In addition, material caps would stay at 999 for each in this scenario so that you can still hold the same amount, but cannot go through them all at once. Please let me know what you all think!  

**TL;DR:** To find a better balance between building and shooting, have certain amount of building “Energy” that runs out after certain number of mats. Regain Energy after a certain amount of time or by doing damage to players. Keep material caps where they are now.

(Day 1 player)","For reference, I've been playing the Battle Royale section of Fortnite since the day it came out on my PS4, I've since moved to PC. This game grew on me a ton back in season 2, which is still by far my most played season, and I've played every season up until this point. I've spoken with multiple people, and I can 100% confirm that all of them agreed that season 5 has the worst meta to date. Epic, I love your game but you're pulling me as well as my friends further and further away. First off, you nerfed shotguns. This is probably one of the most impactful things yet, let me explain. In this game, my friends and I don't find that we make progress with assault rifle fights. We find them random, and a waste of time. The shotgun in this game was our little sweet spot, because it's one of the most skill-based weapons in the game. You aim on their head, you cracked them hard. You miss, you get penalized, and everything in-between. This was our way to fight people and be able to imply our skill into the game. In this meta, no one even uses shotguns as much because it's easier to get melted by an SMG or a drum gun. By nerfing shot guns, you're essentially making one of the last skill based weapons obsolete and unusable. The thing I hate most about this game is the bloom system, and I think tons of people can agree with me. It makes gunfight's outcomes random, which is why charging in with a shotgun was my favorite way to get the job done. You've also nerfed building, another skill-based mechanic in the game that is the only reason your game is fun. If your game didn't have building, everyone would be on a different battle royale, because you damn well know your shooting system doesn't suffice for a competitive game. Anyway, you made it so now guns absolutley shred walls down, to the point where gaining high ground on an opponent with a large magazine size is next to impossible. If an opponent establishes high ground first and sees you first, it's basically over at that point. When you try to become level with your opponent, it just gets shredded up and you start from square one. Also, I know some people bring up the point ""just shoot back."" Believe me, I try, but with such an unreliable bloom system it's never in the hands of the player to supress an enemy so that you can actually gain the advantage. Example, a few games ago I was in a situation where I was pinched between 2 teams. My friend and I made the decision that the best option was to kill the team in front of us so that we could get out of the pinch. We begin the rush, but they have the high ground. One has a drum gun, the other an LMG. This makes it impossible for us to do anything to these people. Eventually after about 10 walls I give up and make the decision to shoot back to hopefully get them to hide so I can gain some sort of position. Upon shooting back, every single bullet misses, theirs hit and I die, and just like that it's back to the lobby. Anyway, I'm hoping you can see where I'm coming from. You're making this game less and less skill based with every update, almost to the point where winning a fight is a coin toss. Epic, please cater to your hardcore audience more than the casuals that hop on once a week. We're the ones that played your game when it was just beginning to surface. We're the ones that spend the V-Bucks when you come out with a skin. We're the ones that grow your concurrent player base daily, and yet you're doing everything in your power to bring us back down. Then, you want to start a competitive scene. Do you see CS:GO adding a weapon with no recoil? Do you see CS:GO making it so that you can accurately aim while shooting with rifles? Do you see Siege making it so that everyone carries guns that shred apart buildings? No, because it has no place. If you're going to take anything from this, at least fix the building. ",FortNiteBR

Note: I play on Xbox.

I, like many others, was under the belief that if I played with a PC player, that I would be in a **cross-platform lobby only**. Meaning that if I playing duo with a PC friend, I would be playing against duos consisting of 1 PC player and 1 Xbox player. For squads, it would be at least 1 Xbox player, at least 1 PC player in each squad.

I'm here to confirm that that is not the case. Today, my squad of 3 Xbox players, 1 PC player, went up against (and lost against) an entire PC squad consisting of TSM\_Myth, OPscT, Saint, and Fazezaddy.

So not only does this make it more difficult for console players who want to play with their PC friends, but it also means that all PC squads are commonly going up against squads that potentially have 1-3 console players. This makes lobbies even easier in for professionals and all competitive PC players in events we've seen like Fortnite Fridays.",FortNiteBR

I’m doing this one because I wanted to tell people about save the world and it’s benefits, so here it goes. 

    I said benefits but there is really only one benefit to battle royale and that’s v-bucks. Everyone that plays battle royale wants v-bucks and some become so desperate they believe leaving a like and comment enters them in a giveaway. I have been playing the game for a few months now and I have earned 4000+ v-bucks. The only problem is you don’t get v-bucks as soon as you begin playing the game. 

   In the game you have to challenges, similar to battle pass challenges, to earn them. Everyday, you get a daily challenge that rewards 50 v-bucks. Daily challenges usually take no more than an hour to complete. Another way to get v-bucks is storm shield defenses. 

   A storm shield defense is a mission that increases in difficulty as you progress but it rewards you 100 v-bucks per completion. One isn’t always available so you have to progress through the game to continue to unlock them. 

   Events can also reward v-bucks but in my opinion the current event isn’t too rewarding v-buck wise. 

   Once unlocked the collection book, something you put your gun schematics (crafting recipes) that you don’t want in, gives you 500 v-bucks occasionally when leveling it up. 

    Now is probably the best time to get it because it is 50% off. 

     To summarize everything I said, to get v-bucks you have to play the game and it does take time but it pays off if you put in the time.

If you win a game, you would get the choice to either go back to the lobby, OR queue up in another game filled with winners. You wouldn’t be able to get in from anywhere other than the Victory Royale screen, (so no continued access after the one game), you can only play after a win.

This new game would grant double XP, and if you win, you get to queue up again for triple XP. This would give winning a sense of purpose other than getting those stats up. EPIC could even make the Winners Royale map a little different, (fun victory related structures, new colors for water, grass, trees, etc.). And reward players who win the Winners Royale with a new banner icon and spray.

I just thought of this while I was loading up Fortnite and thought it was pretty cool, hopefully you guys like it!

But now we have quite 'annoying' splodes which I assume we can all agree with and a bunch of guns that absolutely melt buildings and don't require as much skill to aim, in other words, ' spray and pray ' meta where everyone is running SMG's / Shotgun and perhaps RL / GL / C4.

I think this could be a VERY interesting game mode. There are so many times where my squad only has three players, and lacks a fourth. And there are also times where I’m playing duos with a friend, but another is left out primarily because we don’t want to run a three man squad. This game mode would eliminate those weird scenarios. 

On top of that, I believe the pacing could be perfect for this mode. Duos (for me) is a tad bit slow, and fights usually end pretty fast. Squads (for me) is a tad bit too hectic with the spam. I think teams of 3 would flow perfectly with the fortnite style, map design, and pace of the game.

So as it stands now, when a bunch of good players get into a lobby as seen in the summer skirmish match this past weekend, they play very...passively. There was ~35 people in the 7th circle regularly and as a result everyone was lagging horribly and it was an embarrassment. Because as it stands now, there’s no reason to push a player if you don’t have to.  In fact it’s disadvantageous of pushing someone. Sure you can possibly get better loot but there’s no way of knowing what a player/team has for sure until the fight begins. Having fights drains mats, health, ammo and possibly most importantly, will draw the attention of nearby players who now have more of all of those resource who will clean up the now healing/looting team. So the better strategy when going for wins is to loot up in the beginning and then just hide in a 1x1 by the edge of the circle and do emotes until the circle moves which is what almost everyone did for their chance at $250,000 this past weekend.

I propose this: killing a player gives you and your allies health and shields right there and then. You can make it to where the little drone thing that teleports you out when you are eliminated comes and zaps you with something. The amount of health and materials would change depending on if it’s solos, duos, or squads. For solos it’d be 20 hp (10 shield and 10 health) and 75 of each material. For duos it’d be 15 hp (10/5) and 50 of each material. For squads it’d be 10 hp(5/5) and 30 of each material. 

Or conversely eliminated players can drop a “mini llama” that does the same thing but requires you to run over there and get the llama.

(Also for tournaments a game time CLOSER to blitz would help the snooze fest that is competitive play right now.
And obviously switch to a point system in competitive play where kills count towards standings in a somewhat big way.)",FortNiteBR

Who would have thought? The same people that complained about the shotguns also complained the tac subby is gone..Aka the gun at MEDIUM distance that would melt you and was spamable.  So now we are left in a meta where short range really doesn't matter at all, the only thing that matters is that you have a gun that sprays. Its also less skill based as well, obviously good players will be able to destroy bad players no matter what but it does decrease skill. Before you would need to be able to build at someone and get close range through the spray. Now instead you just have a spray war.

The arguments of ""it was op"" and ""shotguns were the most used"" is just straight nonsense. For the last 2-3 patches subby was still better than double pump atleast and now the shotguns are pretty pointless becuase subbys do what they do but better from longer range. Shotguns are also the most used because people dont like afking in a tower spraying for 10+ minutes. Its boring rng gameplay. The only people I saw that didnt like shotguns were controller players that couldnt just aim assist from a distance and couldnt hit shots up close. Every other pro I know stopped using the pump/call it garbage. 

Most fun patch in this game was when it was the ""rush meta"" where First bullet accuracy was doo doo and you couldnt really peak shot so you were forced to push people. Countered the afk sit. Now at the end of every duos game we are forced to play like the other noobies that are sky high afk and wait for the bubble or a pick (which we usually get) however its extremely boring. 

All in all the majority of casuals are clueless anyways I hope the game goes back in the right direction instead of call of duty spam wars so we can get a competitive game. Noobies dont care anyways so making the game more competitive wouldnt hurt.",FortNiteBR

* **Fix for Building Pro bugs**
   * e.g. the *trap swap*, *StW Builder Pro unresponsiveness*
* **Fix for Xbox crossplay problem**
* **Fix for auto-run**

# 2. Additional information (if anything is unclear)

* **Button remapping -** currently  in development. However, I'd like to offer my view on what features/  options button remapping should offer if it were to be implemented right now.
   * Options to perform a single action (e.g. 'equip harvesting tool'):
      * Press button
      * Hold button
      * Button combination (e.g. press L1+R1)
   * Selection methods for 'Quickbar' and 'Blueprints':
      * 1-button cycle (e.g. R1 --&gt;)
      * 2-button cycle (e.g. &lt;-- L1 | R1 --&gt;)
      * Direct hotkeys
      * Hotkey combination (e.g. hold L1+press R1)
      * (weapon) wheel (for *accessibility* mostly)
   * Selection methods for 'Materials', 'Traps' and 'Build direction'
      * 1-button cycle
      * 2-button cycle
      * wheel for traps (if more traps are introduced)
* **Dedicated edit button -** button remapping would make this possible by design. If button remapping is still a long way off, there is a couple of options in the meantime.
   * *\[Best\] L3*: Sprint from L3 to automatic (de)activation at outer 10% (=placeholder value) of stick deflection
   * *\[Good\] Button combination (e.g. L1+R1)*: Could interfer with Builder Pro + turbo building!
   * *\[Worst\] Triangle*: Equip harvesting tool becomes 'hold triangle'
* **Remove delay building with Builder Pro -** this  delay is present to allow for pre-editting of building pieces. I'd like to offer a way to get rid of the delay and still allow for pre-editting.
   * Hold circle while pressing R1/R2/L1/L2 to preview build
      * Only possible in combination with a different edit button
* **Decimal increments sensitivity -** the jump between consecutive sensitivities is too big.
* **Building sensitivity -** different senstivity for building and aiming.
* **Sprint with stick deflection -** sprint automatically (de)activates at the outer 10% (placeholder value) of stick deflection; the inner 90% would be used for walking from a very slow walk to the current maximum walking speed.
* **Dedicated buttons for traps -** this is NOT a console exclusive suggestion! Currently, all traps are hidden  behing 1 trap UI slot or previewed in your backpack/ inventory. This is suboptimal design, only becoming worse with new traps being added.
   * Add a seperate trap quickbar with 4(?) slots, which functions the same as the (weapon) quickbar
   * How to implement for console?
      * A button is used to enter/leave the trap quickbar (e.g. D-pad left)
      * R1/R2/L1/L2 are used for instant access to/ placement of the 4(?) traps
   * How to implement for PC?
      * Similar to console AND the option for instant hotkeys, without first entering the trap quickbar
* **Advanced control settings**
   * *Aim assist strength sliders -* to determine how 'sticky' the aim assist is, which should be seperate for projectile and hitscan weapons
   * *Aim assist window slider -* to indicate where the aim assist kicks in around a hit box. Note: this should definitely scale well with distance!
   * *Aim smoothing slider -* the amount of 'delay' for stick input to reach the actual turn rate governed by the response curve
   * *Dead zone (inner and outer) slider* \- to determine the 'responsiveness' of the stick movement
   * *Response curve selection and/or creation* \- the relation between stick input and aim output
   * *Thumbstick controller configurations -* Legacy, Legacy southpaw, southpaw
* **Aim assist model adjustments**
   * No aim assist on DBNO
   * No aim assist on dead people (bug?)
   * Remove the strong pull when going ADS - can be abused by spamming ADS and resetting this effect constantly
   * Seperate adjustable aim assist for projectile weapons
   * Fix for aim assist not always working when shooting through windows
* **KB+M and XIM4 in PC/ seperate lobbies -** Controversial, I know. With Xbox announcing native KB+M support (e.g. [here](https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/25/17500298/microsoft-xbox-one-keyboard-mouse-support-razer-chroma)) and PS Fortnite already offering native KB+M support, this is (going to be) an issue with an eye on fair play. XIM4 is probably even worse as it emulates controller input, essentially allowing for KB+M with aim assist.
* **Add additional toggles -** mostly useful toggles that should help alleviate some nuisances.
   * *Reset build direction*, *Reset pre-editted build*, *Cancel crouch when building* speak for themselves
   * *Reset weapon selection -* always defaults to first (or whatever) quickbar slot when entering quickbar
   * *Prefer sprint -* toggle/ hold button/ key to turn OFF sprint
* **Reorganize building blueprints -** can be useful for those Combat Pro and Standard users
* **Console specific features -** with gyroscopic aiming added to Switch, Epic doesn't shy away from console specific features.
   * For PS4: *gyrocopic aiming* (Switch has it, and the Dualshock 4 has a gyro/accelerometer...), *touchbar swiping* (see e.g. Warframe)
   * For Switch: ?
   * For Xbox: ?
* **Visual settings -** motion blur and shadows are probably the most important ones.
* **Fixes**
   * *Xbox crossplay problem* **-** persistent issue with secondary accounts not being able to use crossplay
   * *M**issing control settings StW* **-** with StW going F2P soon, people are going to want to try this mode, with the same settings they use right now
   * *Auto-run* \- really unreliable
   * *Building Pro bugs* - the trap switching bug for example has been in the game for months now

So I had the idea that you have two sensitivity settings for building and shooting for example 9-9 for building and 6-6 for shooting.
I play builder pro so you could use the right analog stick to press once and it would switch.So you can be in a fight and quickly switch sensitivity to build up and then switch back to shoot.

Pump: The headshot multiplier nerf was the biggest part. Most damage buffs on this gun wouldn't be as effective as before. So maybe if the green did 95 and the blue did 100 damage that would be great. Before I get backlash for saying this I just want to say that if this gun is to be used individually without swap than this is somewhat needed. Pump is no a powerful high risk high reward gun because of lack of swap. Plus the chances you hit the perfect headshot with the blue is low so don't complain about 200 damage.

Tactical: I'm really sure this gun could be buffed because smg's are too much of a competition. I think with the lack of double shotty we could give it the headhot multiplier of 2.5 again. 

I'm sorry but I am unaware of problems with the heavey. The only thing I could say is +3 damage so it can one headshot if lucky. But IDK",FortNiteBR

However, even the heavy has been hurt bad lately. I have seen countless situations where me or a teammate unloads into someone with a heavy for them to walk away laughing after obliterating us with a drum gun. And that's fine. I can grab a drum gun too. 

I like the fact that other weapons are options for close range now but come on. Fortnite has been about shotguns almost as much as it is about building. I have spent months honing my shotgun skills. Learning the intricacies of shotgun battles and the deadly dances that they consist of. I have mastered jumping, ducking, dodging and aiming for that head. Nothing felt as good in a video game as annihilating someone with a shotgun in fornite. Now they are trash. For the most part, shotguns are complete and utter garbage now.

I guess what bothers me the most is that even if they were OP, using shotguns in Fortnite was fun. What do they give us to replace them? Some new lame ass SMG? Im running around with a green SMG now and I realize, this gun just isnt fun to use. Yes it is nice that I can kill someone up close with something other than a shotgun but why would I want to? Is this gun more fun to use? Absolutely not . I mean most of what is in this game is flat out fun. But killing shotguns to force us to use other guns that arent as fun to use as the shotgun as it was just seems counterproductive to me. 

Give us options because they are as fun or better. I should choose other weapons because I want to, not because i have to because you guys completely made shotguns worthless. I dont know what you can do to give us a better close range experience but the new SMG isnt it. 

Also, I dont want double pump or to reduce the weapon equip time, I just want to be able to obliterate people with a solid shotgun blast again or have another option that feels as good as that did. ",FortNiteBR

For example, if each additional person reviving were to add a 15% boost, then the person who is in the knocked state will be revived in approximately half the time (5 seconds) if all other teammates revived simultaneously (45% boost). This can be used as a strategic move, as the team must account for other nearby attacks while quickly picking up the other teammate. 
Maybe it can be added to 50v50 too, where each additional player is a 1% boost.

Game concept:

The game starts as if it's solo, one hundred players battling it out with each other. However when a player is eliminated, they will be put in a team with their killer, forming a duo. If someone from that duo kills another person, the killed person will also join their team, forming a trio. This way, hundred 1-player teams will turn into 5-player teams, 17-player teams, 42-player teams and so on as the game evolves, having one large team at the end.

Practical information:

**How would teams merge?**

Every team has a leader; the person that initially started the team by killing someone as a 1-player team. If the team leader is killed, he and all his teammates will merge with whoever killed their leader.

**What happens if a regular team member is killed?**

Unlike the team leader, a team member **will** be given a chance to be revived by the team. If he isn't being healed by a teammate and runs out of final hp, he will become a part of the team he was killed by.

**How will players change teams properly?**

Just like in Playground Mode, a killed player will be put back in the sky, having a chance to glide towards their newly assigned team.

**How will teams be visualized?**

Your own team will have their name tags shown, just like it does currently. The team leader will have a special icon above their head, to create a bounty-hunter-like atmosphere for other teams.

**Who will be the winner?**

I was thinking of letting the final team leader win, but I'm not sure if this would make people leave the game once they are bound to be a regular team member instead of leader.

Normally you would have to fear the instand headshot but now as it only does around 150 dmg you still have around 50hp left to just sprey your oponent down.

I have seen several big streams now playing only mp. 




Also If you really want a MP meta you should at least buff heals and shield as now its pretty hard to kill an oponnent without losing at least a decent amount of health.

Buffing SMGs made the purple Tac SMG effectively better then a SCAR. Silenced SMGs became perfect and a more common weapon in the meta. TBH, I prefer it over new SMG. The tac SMG was getting too good, so epic decided to sidetrack us with the drum gun, which was even MORE OP then the purple tac. Epic needed to find a solution to both, so they introduced another SMG. They couldn't have four SMGs though, so they needed to vault one to make room for one.
And they chose the tac.
Seriously, I know it needed to be removed because of how OP it was, but why not the silenced? I loved shredding people with purple tacs in Dusty or Tilted.
The new SMG is really good though. It just won't be the same as the tac.
Sorry for the rant, but all in all, tac was too OP. they needed to distract us, gave us drum gun, then they brought back old SMG and saw it as an opportunity to kill the tac SMG.

Also, who else is gonna actually start using Semi-Auto Snipers now?",FortNiteBR

If you're questioning whether i'm the Chappadoodle featured within the video, i've got confirmation within my Epic Games [bio](https://forums.unrealengine.com/member/2508303-chappadoodle).

Given the popularity of the clip I figured it would be fitting if I explained the situation from my perspective and how I died during the rescue attempt; unfortunately due to today's update the I can not provide footage of the replay.

During a game of Fortnite I was attempting to secure high ground during a fight, although before I could secure my desired location my stairs were shot out resulting in me falling off the map. Fortunately I managed to slide most of the distance thus surviving, unfortunately I'd found myself on a ledge outside of the maps build limit, meaning I was trapped. Being trapped I resorted to the pity of others, continuously firing my weapons as to alert players to my location. This eventually alerted a friendly player to my location, a possible Savior, to my dismay this player was eliminated. Fortunately their murderer realizing my situation spared me and decided to rescue me, unbeknownst to me this would result in my death. The rescue was underway and the newest candidate for my rescue was descending towards me. Unfortunately it was quickly made apparent to my Savior that due to the build limit it was impossible to build stairs entirely to me, solution, golf cart! Moment later a golf cart is rapidly plummeting towards me, when it dawns upon me, it's possible this golf cart roles off the ledge into the ocean, killing my Savior and dooming any chance of rescue in the process. Without hesitation I put myself in between the golf cart and the ocean acting as a buffer I prevent any possibility of the golf cart sliding off the map. Unfortunately I forgot about the knock back I was receive on impact, moments from rescue i'm knocked into the ocean, instantly eliminating me. I'm then met with the realization that the player who's spent their entire match attempting to rescue me only to accidentally [eliminate](https://imgur.com/gallery/zwpfJ6z) me due to my own stupidity is Muselk.

Well one botched rescue attempt later, we're here.  
I'm hugely appreciative of the response to my death, even if I didn't contribute to it's popularity.

I'd like to thank;

What frustrates me is always having a new item go to the first empty slot in your inventory. 

You should be able to set a 'rule' for each weapon, so especially at the start of the game where all your inventory slots are free, you can pick up a shotgun and it would go to the desired empty inventory slot, as opposed to having to pick up, reshuffle, pick up bangades, reshuffle etc... If the slot was filled the mechanic would just work as it does now. 

I think this would be a very useful, albeit small change to get rid of a very minor inconvenience, but make the start of game play much smoother and flow better.

With the new moving circle no player has that advantage anymore and both have to move. 
However I feel like in the current state it favors one party of the remaining ones immensely. The circle is just moving way too fast, so that the party across from it basically has to run full sprint to reach it. They cant even shoot because that would be to slow. The  other party closer to the circle can just walk backwards and shoot or spam walls. 
My suggestion would be to make it a little slower to reduce the power of RNGesus.

Firstly, it is way too build-oriented. I was   just       wondering if the    community feels the same way. After  landing,   where      no one has any    materials, I beat my opponents  about 80%+  of the       time. This is because    it is pure gun/aiming  skills put  to the  test.      However, when players    have materials,  my win rate  in a 1v1  then     becomes  20% or so, simply    because I  cannot build  that  good/fast.

It          seems that if  you  can build well in this game, then you can have       less    than  average  aim and still win because you get caught?  build  a     wall.    You   made a mistake and enemy has high ground over   you? its   ok,    just    build a  roof and get out. There are so many   occasions   where I    made  many    mistakes but was able to get away   simply because I    built.    In this  game   building truly allows you  to  get away from    many    mistakes.

On the other hand you can have great aim but if you cannot build, most likely you wont ever win. Maybe end up in top 25 at best.

Another           thing that worries me about this game is how RNG-based game   this     is.    It  is not hard to see many  people saying the same   thing. As     people   get   better they will understand  this. Right   now this  game    makes   people   think they are good. Yet to be    realistic, as  of right    now   there are   tons of 10 year olds who   enjoy  getting  kills  thanks   to the   RNG-based   mechanics so I do   not think Epic   will  change it   anytime   soon. If Epic   changes the   gun mechanics to  be   more   realistic then   these 10 year olds     will get upset and  not be  able to    get kills   anymore. This means   that   eventually the  good  players  will  be    frustrated and end up   leaving the   game.  Not to  mention  these  kids are    also  constantly  throwing money to    Epic, so  Epic  seems like  they will     always  cater to these kids.

Does  anyone feel this way? **Nothing wrong with being a building game with a bit of shooting on the side**,           but shouldn't BR games' core nature be          shooting/eliminating/defeating   the opponents instead of building? You          could argue that building is   what players do in order to get      kills,    but  personally I feel the   building aspect of the game is      way, way   too  heavy.

TL DR:

1. Game           is extremely build-oriented. Feels like  you can have shit  aim,     but    if   you can build, you win. Made many mistakes? its  fine,  just     build.   You   have an easy shot on someone and can  headshot  them  and    they will   die?   Nope, the opponent will build a       wall/roof/floor/whatever.
2. Not           hard to see people complaining about RNG-based shooting. Epic       caters    to  10 year olds who are happy getting kills with RNG   instead     of  skill.   If  Epic fixes this, these  kids will be upset   and stop     playing  which   means  they will stop buying skins,   meaning less  money    for  Epic.",FortNiteBR

People on this subreddit should use the downtime of the servers to read up on some simple concepts of Databases &amp; Servers to understand that unexpected things can happen, it is a fundamental thing of all computing (unfortunatly). It still amazes me to this day that computer gamers has so little knowledge of fundamental issues and critical errors that can happen on the server side of games.

Keep in mind that this game is still in development, while most of you treat it like a 60 dollar fully developed game.

Appricate the fact that they are working on it in such haste.

Thanks, and if anyone wants some good links ill post some.

Sincerely,

A former PayPal back-end developer that has struggled with similar problems.

Edit: I see some people commenting that since this game is so popular that it is no longer an early access game, sorry to inform you that that’s not the case, and completely illogical.  ",FortNiteBR

We are just the seasoning, as the community we can make a delightful dish disgusting or a decent dish delectable. Fortnite is a delicious dish already, I might say myself. So the question I have for you guys and girls is, what kind of seasoning are you going to choose to be? Appreciative and thankful or extremely salty?

But the devs can fuck right off. Just take a look, every 3 days, matchmaking and login servers go down, this is because epic doesn’t know how to fucking keep their shitty ass servers running. You would think that they could afford better servers after making a dick load of money off of cosmetics and shit. And what really pisses me off, is they they keep adding shitty or OP items instead of fixing any bugs or problems in the bloody game. Every week is a new game breaking bug that ruins shit for a while. Double pump was removed because it was no skill and bullshit. Who, in their right fucking mind, had the brilliant idea of brining it back. And their new way of nerfing it, was to fucking nerf everything. Fucking brilliant. Epic cannot fucking fix a weapon or item without removing it for a month (hence the boogie bomb) and on the topic of micro transactions, 20 FUCKING DOLLARS FOR A SKIN? People complain about a 10$ dlc that adds a new story mode, but 20$ for a skin? Yeah sure why not? Last point, nobody is allowed to complain! Not only because god forbid you have an opinion on the internet, but so many fucking 9 year old cod fanboys have moved to Fortnite and will rip your ass to shreds if you say anything bad about the game. These kids fucking think this game is the goddamn second coming of christ, the game has been driven into the ground, by tumours in the community (ali-a/BBC trolling that kind of shit) toxic 6 year olds from cod, shitty devs, less optimization then the early forms of PUBG and a community the devs don’t listen too.

I have invested countless hours into this game and I loved the fast paced game-play and the divergence from the other Battle Royale games' (H1  and PUBG mainly) defensive nature. Now with the port-a-fort (the least of the problems the update) and the slowing of building and weapon switching, and the ludicrous weapon damage drop off, the game just feels wrong. I love this game and I do not want it to die but I can't help but feel a little betrayed by Epic due to their lack of interests in the community's wishes. I think they believe adding anything means good feed back, but in reality, they are adding the wrong things at the wrong time. I don't believe they should be adding or changing perfectly viable mechanics and the core elements of the game when there are still game breaking bugs that have occurred since the launch of BR. They need to cool it with the updates, especially if they aren't going to give a PTR or beta server to test said updates. I love the game and I don't want it to die so I wanted to express my opinion on the current state of the game.

Week by week the game is becoming progressively less mechanically intense, in my opinion, all these small mechanically intensive elements that existed is what made the game so appealing to me, it was so different to your average FPS, yet so hard to master. In return you were rewarded by having that edge on your average player.

In case you have no idea what I'm talking about, the most recent patch added a ""delay"" to switching weapons, which ruins aggressive play-styles entirely and just caters to passive or defensive players.

I could maybe understand the whole double pump nerf epidemic (yes it was op, yes it needed a nerf, but it didn't need to be completely removed and made useless) I didn't see this update coming at all though, I think that there is better options to consider that caters to all play-styles fairly then completely fucking up one type of play-style completely.

Please feel free to have a discussion below about better possibilities then adding a delay to switching weapons.


Oh and did I mention that you also get a weapon delay when editing or building? That's a joke.

In fact, it takes a whole lot for me to get onto reddit and post something.

When I first saw this game a few months ago, introduced through a good friend of mine, I kind of laughed at him for playing it. It looked like a game for kids and the gameplay he showcased wasn't that interesting either. However, 2 weeks later these clips started showing up on my facebook timeline of people building extremely quick and using tactics like gun swapping to out-play their opponents. When I saw this I immediately became interested, because I noticed that a high level of skill was involved and that the game was ultra fast-paced. So I finally started playing with the mindset of getting as good as the people in the clips that showed up on my timeline. To achieve this I spent hours landing in Tilted Towers just dying thousands of times, but getting better and better bit by bit. The amount of skill needed for quick building and gun swapping is what drove me to keep practicing and was also what gave me the most rewarding feeling ever when I killed someone using it.
Than there was the double pump nerf. Kind of expected, but very poorly executed since the whole gun kinda broke. When I saw Epic's port-a-fort preview I was kind of sad because it (in most cases) promotes a passive/defensive playstyle which slows the game down, but I was like ""eh, whatever, I'll get used to dealing with people using it"". But then I started playing the game and the gun swapping immediately felt off: just felt clunky and slow. I was unable to quickscope and unable to push highground and quickly swap to my weapon to kill people. The two things that felt the most rewarding, the two things what drove me to get better, the two things what drove me to play this game to begin with.
Now, I see ALOT of people posting that the delay ""isn't that bad"", but actually it is. If you are one of those people who feel like it isn't that bad, you play slow or defensive. Aggressive playstyles got nerfed hard and the game just doesn't feel as fast-paced for me anymore. The motivation to play and get better was lost after 3 hours of playing for me.
Epic keeps commenting that they want to promote Fortnite E-Sports yet they keep taking away the things that take skill and seperates the casual players from the more experienced players.

I also want to add that patches like these give away the mindset of Epic: switching weapons for higher burst damage is something they want to combat. Because of this, I don't see the situation getting better over the long run and therefor I'll probably just quit this game. Inb4 people calling me a retard for overreacting: it's what made the game fun for me. Fast-paced, high-skilled gameplay. In my opinion, they should balance the guns around weapon swaps and not the other way around, but it doesn't seem like that's going to happen ever.

P.S. Only legit delay would be on rockets.",FortNiteBR

During the summer when PUBG exploded, it was rare that the servers were down. Additionally, Epic is a massive company, and even shut down Paragon to dedicate more resources to this. 

I am not saying PUBG is better than Fortnite, and I am only using it as an example due to how it also experienced a massive growth in popularity.

Prove this by the ratio 3/28 = 0.1.

[Imagem 1](https://i.imgur.com/6gmrqYi.png)
 


If it were just for that, I do not think it would even make sense to learn to use it because the learning curve is large and time-consuming for so little improvement. However, in other more offensive constructions, such as that of the image, the difference was great. In the example, the Builder PRO won by 6 buttons. The ratio 6/19 = 0.31.

[Imagem 2](https://i.imgur.com/bHtn6Z0.png)



In my opinion, the Builder PRO is advantageous in relation to Combat PRO. However, this advantage is not absurdly significant and is far from the speed of construction of the console being close to the PC. It depends on the preference of each player to adopt the new control configuration or not.

Now you added build pro, which is fantastic btw but some of us have so many hours of muscle memory in combat pro and we just want to get rid of the pyramid piece. Now if i say i want to remove the pyramid piece, people will tell me ""just play build pro."" 

""Build pro is way better""

Build pro is cool totally cool but..

Let me approach this in terms of efficiency. (Which people have done so many many many times before)

With the pyramid gone, you will always be 1 shoulder button away from ANY piece you want. In terms of efficiency, with the pyramid gone it will be on par with build pro. 

Yet, you ignored us. Something so simple as letting us remove a build piece was ignored (""oh i didnt know you were a professional coder"") And you introduced a whole new control layout. 

I'll be frank, anyone who uses the pyramid piece to build their 3x3 base sucks. Theyre trash. Nobody uses it. In solos that is, squads is different. But thats why we have been begging for the OPTION. For months. And with each patch, it's been ignored. 

Now i have to make this post and take the insults. Redditors are fucking mischievous. They love to act self righteous as well. Cant wait to be downvoted by pc masterracers, build pro elitists and epic does nothing wrongers. I dont want karma. I dont want a riot. I just want a small option to remove a piece that i and the majority of users never use.

Pros of Tac:
-Extremely common
-Rapid Fire 
-Average range

Pros of Pump:
-Extremely common
-Can one shot 
-Great range

Pros of Heavy:
-Good range
-Decent RoF

Literally the only thing it has going for it is the increased range. Yet the pump still does that better.

It can shoot faster than a Pump but in alot of situations you would need a follow-up shot, the Tac would just be better.

It can't one-shot but I could be wrong. The most I've ever hit with a Heavy Shotgun is 193. The weapon just feels redundant. To make matters worse the Heavy Shotgun is extremely rare compared to the other two shotguns. You could find 15 pump/tacs a game but only 2-4 heavies. 

I suggest that the Heavy at least be able to one shot at a decent range to make it worth using over the pump. Right now it's a poor man's pump.

I have a theory about the comet that may or may not blow your mind. I believe that aliens... are coming to Fortnite Battle Royale and Save the World. This may sound crazy, but I have some evidence that can back it up

So... what first gave birth to this idea was the new leaked skin and glider. Although the [skin](https://imgur.com/a/JBMT6) may not be a alien, my first thoughts about the skin was that it was. Then I saw the [glider](https://imgur.com/a/ECr83). Thought this would be a glider that the alien would fly in on. Of course looking back at it now I realize I sound stupid, but in all honestly this has nothing to do with the theory. 

**Evidence #1:** The Spaceship

Also this has been [data-mined](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/88ciqg/comet_in_the_sky_confirmed_in_source_files/?st=jfejoaic&amp;sh=afbdb5db) as a comet, I think it's just a placeholder put in by Epic to make sure nobody finds out what it really is. I think it's actually a spaceship crashing to Earth. I don't have any real evidence other than the fact that as you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE/comments/8bgbq1/the_comet_has_come_to_save_the_world/), the comet has appeared in Save the World today after the lauch of v3.5. STW as been known as a zombies survival since launch, so why not change it up a bit with aliens instead of zombies. What other reason would they have to add this if it's just a comet? Even if aliens don't come to BR, I think we'll surely have them in Save the World as a simple reskin of the zombies.

**Evidence #2:** Flight 370

On March 8th, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 vanished, never to be found. I don't know much about this story, but I'll just allow [this](https://twitter.com/classsicbitch/status/975797141775048704/photo/1) Twitter feed to explain it for you. 
HERE: https://twitter.com/classsicbitch/status/975797141775048704/photo/1
I was looking through this and noticed something. User @Bdbxtjmsa1 posted a tweet saying this: ""20.8.5.25 1.18.5 20.1.11.9.14.7 15.22.5.18 41818"". Each of these numbers (that are split with periods) translates to a letter, which spells out ""They are taking over on April 18 2018"". Hold up! There's also someone who broke down the voicemail, as each word was said in phonetic alphabet, and they translated it to ""Danger SOS it is dire for you to evacuate be cautious they are not human SOS danger SOS"". It then gives coordinates, these coordinates being where it's believe the plane crashed. On top of all of this there was morse code message sent to a twitter user. Also this may sound confusing, try to stay with me. I believe this has been proved to be fake, but that doesn't mean Epic can't use it.

**Evidence #3:** Morse Code

Ok, so everybody knows about the morse code vibrating controller thing that translated to ""SOS D 5 418"". Within this twitter thread, we one, see **""SOS""**, then we see coordinates **""D5""**, and then we even see the date April 18th in both of them! This is not a coincidence!

**Evidence #4:** Leaked Gun

Also with the release of v3.5, data-miners found a new [gun](https://fortniteinsider.com/double-pistols-space-pistons-coming-to-fortnite-battle-royale/), one legit being a Space Pistol. Could this be a alien weapon?

**My Thoughts**

This could be a way for Epic to introduce more guns, skins, traps, etc in the future. Don't worry, I do think Tilted will still be getting destroyed, just by the alien spaceship.

Sorry if this was confusing, I used the last of my brain cells putting this together.

Im not arguing in the facter that its a ""og"" skin which it kinda is but that dosn't matter. The reason the Love Ranger returned is because Epic Games wants to milk those wings aslong as possible; this is most likely the last time we will see it due to community backlash; due to Epic saying it was a limited skin. 

Personally I cant see them bringing back any haloween item till next haloween if they do at all.

I had read that epic was finally implementing the mappable buttons idea for building and I could not have been happier. As someone who plays often with PC friends I constantly practice building (in attempt to keep up with them) and I've gotten pretty fucking good for a console player, but at some point, the controls hold you back. So this news was awesome for me. 

I was also hoping for a big optimization update, I figured it had been long enough, with reddit constantly bitching about it, this had to come in v3.5. (And it did, and it was awesome, thanks Epic) 

Point is. I was hyped for this update. 

Then it drops. I read the patch notes. It's looking good, then I get to the part about weapon swapping. As soon as I read it, I new I'd hate it. I do hate it. Everyone hates it. I don't know a single person that doesn't hate it. 

On to the Builder Pro, as I believe it's called. Why can't I change my left bumper to stairs? As someone who used pyramid ramps since the beginning of time, I'm used to hitting left bumper to get to my 'stairs'. So I'd like to be able to use left bumper as my stairs. But no. I'm stuck pressing this slow ass trigger, that takes a while to register on one press, TWICE to build my stairs. At that point it's faster to just use my fucking pyramid ramps and combat pro. 

To say I'm disappointed would be an understatement. I'm hoping that in the next hot-fix they revert swap times back to what they used to be, and in the next update they allow re-mappable building controls for builder pro.  

**TL;DR:** Epic did some great work with optimization and things run smoothly now on console. But the new build controls and weapon swap times take away from it.

My goal, and what made this game so fun, was to be able to build as good as popular streamers and do all sorts of awesome stuff with weapon swaps and editing. 

Since playing the new update, I've lost a sense of ""fun"" in fortnite that I had previously and it just doesn't feel as rewarding to play as I knew aggressive play    (which is what makes the game fun, not playing defensive) and being a good player was being punished in the game.


In my experinece it was the strive to win that kept more people playing, not because of a skill gap. People I knew play the game to get a win, and then quit. If they see how cool the game is with the higher skill gap that'll lead to more people playing after their first win. 


Edit: Every building fight I get into with someone just makes me more upset with the direction of how the game is going.  It's literally who has the high ground always wins now as the person below has to build up and the person on top already has his weapon out ready to fire, while the person trying to move up has to deal with the weapon delay.

1. Instabuild forts... What is this? You have materials, you have building options. Now you don't even have to worry about building your own fort or harvesting materials just drop this and you have an A+ pro fort.

2. Vending machines. Back in my day we had to loot. And if we didn't find it looting we needed to get kills for loot. You know, win fights, make plays, the objective of the game? Now you can drop your instafort and just spend your hard earned materials on one of these babys instead. Besides materials are for currency not for building FORTS. Who would've known? Make sure to hodl your materials everyone! 

3. The Guided RPG. Well kids before 22nd century warfare we had to actually have sights on our Target to get kills. Well think no longer! You can now hide and kill better than ever! If you spent your entire game camping in a bush waiting to get one kill after landing at lonely lodge this weapon is for you. Enjoy not even making contact with your opponent for a kill! Once upon a time you had to think, be sneaky, be quick, make decisions! Now let this thing just take all that away and do the thinking for you.

I used to love the double pump but saw it was broken for casual players to enjoy the game. We move on to the heavy pump and hope it's our saviour when in reality it's just a pump/tac hybrid that can't crit 200 and is slower than the tac so... that didn't work out for comp players either. Now we can't quickly edit then shoot when backed into a corner without a load time for majority of the guns? I get there are work-arounds for this (sub-tac for e.g.) but yet another part of the game feels worse than how it used to be in dec/jan. on top of it all, the game hasn't been in a golden age for what feels for AGES. Fix the gun swap glitch that literally is game breaking in crucial moments, add custom games so we don't have to sit and wait for your LTMs that glitch our system (SHOOTING GAMES DO THIS hurry tf up and stop giving it to youtubers and pros only). next update is make or break for me. 

I get that it's f2p - however it's a massive game with massive income coming in, and media attention across the world. As the company running this, it's your responsibility to make sure your seen the way you want to be seen. The many additions to the game/expansion has clearly cause too many issues with the game to the point it's unstable. stop adding stuff, fix your game completely, give us an update, then we'll go back to the updates again. how many people need to tell Epic this before they listen. 

if I didn't pay for skins/emotes, I wouldn't be complaining, but I did put money into the game and my expectations are higher than what's shown. 

december/january was the best feeling gameplay for me (started early dec)

building, which was the main feature to this game and was truly the skill cap, is now available to the kid who downloaded the game yesterday. 

Instead of nerfing the things that skilled players use, promote the noobs to actually put effort into doing this so that someone with 200 wins isn’t at par with someone with 0. 

come on, and on top of this, new bugs and glitches come weekly, it’s a shame that they’re expected to come. 

nothing was broken in the game, so why try to cater to the noobs and mobile players. 


TL;DR: as I saw in another post similar to this, what I’m saying is that the game is catering to the people who don’t want to put any effort into getting good, and ruining the experience for skilled players!

Epic isnt infallible for sure (I have thought the addition of Tilted was terrible from day one) and no doubt there will be stuff wrong with their patches, and you may not like the cadence of updates. But Epic is managing a complex business and doing FTP better than most IMO. 

If you want a change make an intelligent thoughtful post about it and see if the community agrees.

This is a genuine concern from me and all of my friends who play fortnite. I have not had a game like this in so long where every single time i drop in i am buzzing to play and loving the high skill cap and different creative ways to play the game. What Epic have done thus far has been nothing short of brilliant when it comes to game development EXCEPT this latest 3.5 patch.

For those who don't know this is a run down of it copied directly from the official fortnite website:

Added a short equip time to many weapons (particularly, those with a slower rate of fire). This will reduce the effectiveness of quickly switching between weapons for high burst-damage. Removed the reloading animation on the Pump Shotgun. Weapons affected are: Rocket Launcher Hand Cannon Revolver Tactical Shotgun Pump Shotgun Heavy Shotgun Bolt-Action Sniper Rifle Hunting Rifle Crossbow

TLDR of this^

-the time to switch between weapons has been MASSIVELY increased.

What this means:

-players who have an aggressive playstyle have now been punished due to inability to use double shotguns (pump/tac/heavy) -players with a long range playstyle (i.e snipers) have also been punished as there is no way to take some shots into someone and quickly pull out your snipe to finish them off# -players who build a lot (aka any player with decent skill) has now been punished as there is no way to build, switch to a shotty to get a quick hit in and then repeat (rip Myth)

This new patch makes the game feel so clunky, not give high skilled players a high skill cap and instead promotes people sitting in bases and shooting people at range. If the main argument with this change is to reduce the amount of shots one person can do then why don't you just nerf the damage all the above guns do (oh wait they already did that, thanks damage drop off)

This is granting worse players a better opportunity to win games and not encouraging them to grasp the games mechanics (building, switching between weapons quickly etc) but instead keeps them at an average, ""casual"" level of gameplay.

Once again, this is a genuine concern of mine with a game that has been stellar from the beginning, this is not a jab at epic games because they have been the best game dev in a long time, always listening to the community and taking the pro players and streamers inputs and implementing changes quickly and efficiently.

So please Epic, hear me out and revert these changes- do not fall into the Riot Games trap of ""Oh look at this op thing, lets nerf it to the ground so noone ever uses it again and then slowly try to buff it in the next few months, but people won't use it anyway"" cough Old Nidalee cough

Please upvote for exposure so Epic can see this. (again not attention seeking)

thanks gamers.

TLDR; upvote this thread to get epic to change the weapon switch speed back to where it used to be, thanks.",FortNiteBR

1) Small delay time when switching weapons:
Means you have to learn how to aim and to stop trying to look for loopholes to have a faster than normal shooting rate. 

2) Port-a-Fort:
Right, its an instant fort but its a fort like any other, and its quite easy to raid too. Btw its not only for beginners, experienced players can use it too.

3) Bugs:
Theres bugs if course, but epic fixes them when they can. Just imagine if Fortnite was run by Bethesda.

Fortnite stays fresh because of the constant content they add to the game, they might not always make the whole community happy but it works nonetheless. 

So stop whining, be grateful that they are doing something and hope for something more to your liking in the next update.",FortNiteBR

For example, if you want to build a floor in builder pro, you press O (circle) to enter build mode, then R1 to select floor then R1 to place. In the normal mode, you press O which puts you on the wall in build mode and then R1 which selects the thing on the right which is the floor, then R2 to place the floor. Its the same number of buttons being pressed. 

However, if you want to build ramps in builder pro, you press O, L2 then L2 to place, but in the normal mode, its O, R1, R1 then R2 to place. This way, its faster to place ramps in builder pro, but if you use the pyramid ramps, its O, L1 then R2 to place, which is the same number of buttons being pressed. 

I think what I would like, is a way to rearrange the order of the buildings. Wall first, then ramps, then pyramids, then floors. This way, the ramps and the floor pieces are easier to access. Its pretty much like thus already if you use the pyramid ramps, but I like to be able to edit the stairs as well.

Im seriously dissappointed in EPIC right now. They continue to add stuff which a lot of people aren't even asking for (we want bug fixes as a priority) and continue to break things.

After playing Fortnite Battle Royale pretty intensively for the past months and totalling just over 100 wins at the moment of writing, i have been able to aquire some knowledge that i’d love to share with you guys.

I’ll be splitting this guide up into several chapters:

1. Settings
2. Gun mechanics
3. Building mechanics/strategies
4. Advancement throughout the game
5. Combat

Remember that most of the knowledge that i’m sharing is based on personal experience with the game, so your experiences/opinions could differ from mine. 

**1. Settings**
Your settings play a big factor in your chances of winning as they directly impact the way that you move, shoot and build. 




**1.1 Graphics**
Depending on the power of your computer graphical settings make a huge difference in how you experience the game. For competitive playing I would recommend the following settings:

Frame Rate: 60-144 (Depending on your monitors refreshing rate)
3D Resolution: 100%
View distance: Far-Epic (Depending on power of your computer).
Shadows: Off (This makes the game run smoother, use of shadows is minimal in Fortnite).
Anti-Aliasing: Off
Textures: Epic
Effects: Low
Post Processing: Low
Vsync: Off
Motion Blur: Off
Show Grass: Off





**1.2 Controls**
Having good hotkeys is vital to improving your gameplay. It will allow you to outbuild enemies and to access your items faster. The following hotkeys are the ones I use and I would highly recommend these to others.

Moving: WASD
Interact: F
Repair: `
Slot 1-2-3: 1, 2, 3
Slot 4-5: X, C
Trap Slot: 5
Crouch: CTRL
Wall: E
Ramp: Q
Floor: Mouse button or Z if mouse button is not available
Inventory: TAB
Map: B

**1.3 Sensitivity**
Your sensitivity settings enable you to chose how accurate you want to be versus how agile you can be. Lower sensitivity will (in general) give you more control over your movement and will enable you to aim more precisely, however this also has a down side: your ability to turn quickly will diminish and your building speed will too. Personally I prefer a lower sensitivity. Mine is as follows:

NOTE: I play at 400 dpi.

Mouse Sensitivity: 0.10
ADS Sensitivity: 0.62
Scoped Sensitivity 0.62

I can’t recommend any console sensitivity settings, however the general rule applies even more on console: The lower your sensitivity the more accuracy, the less agile you are. This works vice versa. 
 
ALWAYS make sure that your “Enhance mouse accuracy” options is DISABLED on Windows. My windows sensitivity is 6/11.





**2. Gun Mechanics**
Fortnite is notorious (and heavily critiqued) for her gun mechanics. I will try my best to explain how these mechanics work and how you can adjust to these mechanics.


**2.1 First Shot Accuracy**
Many of the guns in Fortnite BR now have something called First Shot Accuracy. This means that the first shot you take after a certain waiting time (-+ 1 second) will be 100% accurate. These shots can make a huge difference for when you are either pushing or defending your position (See: Combat).


**2.2 Spread**
Spread is the distance between your reticle and your crosshairs when you shoot. Your bullets are able to hit anywhere within that “box”. This means that you have to make sure that your enemy is within this box to ensure the highest chance of hitting him. To ensure that your spread is as low as possible, you should try to always tap (Semi-Auto) when shooting enemies that are 20+ meters away, instead of shooting full auto.


**2.3 Bloom** 
Bloom is best described as an RNG (Random Number Generator) based spread. This means that on longer distance shots, even when the reticle (exception: FSA) is directly on the enemy there is still (a rather big) chance of the shot not hitting the enemy. The bloom is randomly generated so not one shot will travel the exact same path. There are ways to reduce the amount of bloom you experience by improving the accuracy you have on every shot (See: Combat).

**2.4 Bullet Drop**
To be able to hit your sniper shots accurately you have to take bullet drop into account, especially when going for headshots. Many thanks to user /u/Faffek for creating [this](https://i.redditmedia.com/T5l-CHeDzmA-H1KyYhXEUZ2QCWLNCVTPDngEzIa0tqY.jpg?w=227&amp;s=5cd23caa17d98d69f85c9202be15a3be) image, which shows bullet drop. Bullet drop is something that will grow on you once you start playing with scoped weapons. 


**2.5 Noticeable combinations**
These weapon combinations are the ones I use according to my playstyle. I’m generally a very aggressive player so my weapon combinations play a big factor in how I’m able to perform when pushing. 

Loadouts (In order of slots):
Early game: AR – Shotgun - Sniper/RPG
Mid game: Pump – Tactical Shotgun – AR (Sniper/RPG optional)
End Game (Final 2 circles): Pump – Tactical Shotgun – Tactical SMG (Blue/Purple) or AR (Sniper/RPG optional).

I always make sure to run atleast one slot (preferably two) with meds/shields, however I sometimes prefer using snipers/RPGs end game depending on where the circle is located, which will cost me a 4th slot. The reason behind using both the Pump and the Tactical is because the first pump shot has a high chance to finish off your enemy, and if it does not you can quickly swap to your tactical to empty another 1-2 rounds before you would be done reloading your pump. Being able to have such high DPS is crucial for winnings gun fights. Having a sniper is great for holding enemies off and it enables you to do a very high amount of damage in a very short amount of time. 


**Double Pump**
One of Fortnite’s most overpowered combinations that has both huge support and huge critique. It allows aggressive players to fire shotgun shots at almost automatic fire rate. The Double Pump only works with the Heavy Shotgun at the moment of writing. These Heavy Shotguns have great range so the Double Pump combination is not just for close quarters combat, but could also be used at 15 meter range to kill and/or remove fortification. 


**Pump to Tactical SMG**
Another great combination is the pump to tactical SMG (Blue/Purple). Hitting the first pump shot is critical and if done right will remove the enemies (full) shield or a big portion of their health. After the shot you should immediately swap to your Tactical SMG to deliver quick damage to finish off your enemy. This combination works extremely well in end-game situations where distance isn’t a problem. The purple tactical SMG delivers 13 shots per second at 18 damage per shot which gives a DPS of 234. This gun is HEAVILY underrated and gives great competitive advantage. I personally only swap it out for an epic/legendary Scar. Running a sniper with this combination is recommended to also ensure longer range capability. 


**2.6 Tips and Tricks**
-	Try to crouch (if possible) when taking shots as this will reduce spread and increase accuracy.
-	Keep your movement to a minimum when shooting longer distance as moving greatly increases your spread. 
-	When aiming for people in between shots that are far distance try to make the small adjustments by moving with A or D. 
-	Slow down. Especially at close range, taking your time to make sure the shots you take actually hit is more important than pushing out as many shots as possible. (Especially when using shotguns)
-	Take your time to adapt to weapon combinations, diversifying your load out is the key to being able to take down enemies that use different playing styles. 





**3. Building Mechanics/Strategies**
Building is a huge part of Fortnite and if you’re not yet good at it you should focus on this. I will be focusing on building offensively.


**3.1 Materials**
The main meta building material in Fortnite is wood. It has a base health of 100 (wall) and 95 (floor/stair) and then goes up to a max of respectively 200 and 190. It is also done fully building the quickest out of all materials (+13 per tick on walls, +12 per tick on floors). Your main use for wood is to be able to aggressively push, quickly fortify yourself when deflecting shots or to reach certain spots. After wood come brick and steel. Both should be used to further fortify yourself, make strong foundations and/or deflect incoming shots.

Using your building abilities is a great way to overwhelm players. In a 1v1 situation it is important to maintain high ground as this in many cases will enable you to spot enemies quicker, and their heads will be easier to hit.


**3.2 High ground**
To gain high ground, building ramps is the fastest way, but also the most vulnerable method. Ramps get shot down easily, and you are vulnerable from getting shot from the sides (and in some cases above). To remove the chance of you getting hit from above, when building a ramp you should always make to sure build another ramp directly above where you’re running. This is possible if there is a structure near you where it can attach to (walls etc.). Whenever pushing with ramps I HIGHLY recommend always building two next to each other to reduce the chance of them being shot down. Once you get more skilled at building you can try to also put walls behind your stairs while building the stairs. So this means:

-	Put down two ramps next to each other
-	While running up the ramps switch to walls
-	Build 2 walls behind the just build ramps
-	Switch to ramps and continue the cycle

This makes it even harder for enemies to shoot down your ramps. This is ONLY recommended when your enemy is below you. 


**3.3 1x1**
The 1x1 is the fastest method to completely surround yourself with walls and gain high ground easily. The key is to have a system when building 1x1. Mine is as follows:

-	Make a full square 
-	Jump
-	Ramp

Keep repeating this cycle, you will be able to build 2 levels of 1x1 in about 1.5 seconds.
Whenever exiting a 1x1 through a door in a gunfight it is highly recommended to build ramps to immediately gain high ground. After having build your ramp, turn around and start building 1x1 ON your ramp to gain safer high ground. 


**3.4 Editing**
Get yourself familiar with editing. This enables you to quickly move through your 1x1 so that you can get out of tricky situations more easily. 


**3.5 Defense**
One of THE most important reflexes in Fortnite is to always build whenever getting shot at. Recognize the direction, build a wall facing the direction and start to build 1x1 up until you can get a clear shot. If you’re being pushed with ramps, counter push by building your own ramps up and build 1x1 on top of the ramp when near the opponent. 





**4. Game Advancement**
As the match comes closer to an end you’re facing the decision on how to move around the circle and how to engage with enemies. General rule applies: Try to maintain high ground. This allows you to have a greater overview of the map, spot enemies quicker and you’re almost always in a position that allows you to hit them better.  


**4.1 Circle movement**
Depending on your playstyle (aggressive or passive) you can chose to locate yourself in the middle of the circle, where you can easily flank/push enemies that are around the map, or you can chose to stay near the edge of the circle and gradually push with it. The second option gives you a bit more coverage since you generally don’t have to worry about people left in the zone. Always make sure that you locate to the circle early on, as this will give you an advantage over people that either just make it inside or people that take damage from the storm. 


**4.2 End game**
When you make it to the last two circles or the last standing 10, you have to identify yourself as either an aggressive player or a passive player.


Aggressive
-	Follow signs of enemies
-	Flank when possible (stay away from frontal contact) 
-	Be fast. Overwhelming your enemies will lead to them stressing and making mistakes.
-	Recover quickly. After a fight, immediately recover and get ready to get into another fight. 
-	Try to stay rational. Don’t take on gunfights where the enemy has a clear advantage over you.


Passive
-	Try to build 1x1 on the highest ground you can find
-	Try to spot enemies from a far and taking them out
-	Hear a gunfight? Flank and wait for the fight to be over, then kill the remaining enemy. 
-	Being pushed? Immediately build up until you can spot your enemy below you.


**4.3 Final two**
In the last stand (1v1) it is most important to identify what kind of player you’re up against. Staying passive against an aggressive player means you are almost always in a disadvantage. This also means that if your opponent is passive, you have to reply with a push. Make sure to get the highest ground possible, destroy their structures and use the time that they need to build/heal/reload to gain high ground by 1x1’ing and then wait for them to pop up.





**5. Combat**
This chapter will be dedicated to just combat, and my experiences as to what is most effective. 


**5.1 Know your guns**
Knowing how your guns work is crucial when being in combat. The weapons you chose to use is up to your personal preference however you should be aware of the general meta in the game:


(Full auto) Assault Rifles:
+ High damage
+ Good consistency in damage
+ Relatively accurate mid to long range
+ Good against structures
- Inferior in close range situations
- Heavily affected by bloom


Burst Assault Rifle:
+ High Damage
+ Good consistency in damage
+ Great accuracy
- Not recommended for destroying structures
- Inferior in close range situations
- Missing one burst can have dramatic effects 


Shotguns:
+ Very high damage
+ Great mobility
+ Great to counter push
- Very inconsistent damage
- Very high damage drop off
- Missing a shot can have dramatic effects


Tactical SMG:
+ Very high fire rate
+ Relatively high damage
+ Amazing close range accuracy
+ Great against structures
- Not so great for long range
- Clip empties relatively quickly
- Have to hit multiple (8-15) shots to kill. 


Snipers: 
+ Very high damage
+Very high accuracy
+ Great use in many situations (diversity!)
+ Useable throughout whole match
- Vulnerable when using 
- High reloading time 
- Requires most skill out all guns


Rocket Launcher/Grenade launchers:
+ Redefines overwhelming (perfect for pushing)
+ High damage
+ Great against structures
- Gives away your location
- Slow reload times
- Bullet travels slow
- Vulnerable when using


**5.2 Stay alert**
Even when in a fight with someone, always try to spot other enemies that might want to push you, and take out your enemies according to the direct threat they form. The general rule = the closer they are, the more danger they form. 


**5.3 Get cover**
A big mistake amongst less skilled players is that they refrain from using the ability to build. Whenever in combat your absolute first priority is to build cover, adapt to the situation and overcome.  


**5.4 Peak**
A great way to lure players is by peaking. Use the third person view to spot them, once you have: try to get cover and quickly land a few hits on them. Wait for their response (either pushing you or falling back). According to the situation you can try to either directly attack them or retreat from your position and go for a flank


**5.5 Bait and switch**
This neat little trick is an amazing way to trick enemies. Whenever building towards someone (double ramp), one side should have an extra ramp on the end. This will make your enemy think you will peak over that side, while you peak over the other (shorter) side and before the enemy will notice you’ll have the ability to land some shots. 


**5.6 Use FSA to your advantage**
When in a fight, get behind your cover and crouch behind it. Now, when aiming down sight you will see your crosshairs completely closed. This means FSA is activated. FSA is NOT affected by crouching which means you can use crouch to peak over your wall, hit your FSA shot, crouch again and wait for your FSA to reset and then repeat the cycle. This means you can keep hitting 100% accurate shots while under virtually complete protection


**5.7 Don’t panic**
Whenever in a fight, try to stay as calm as possible. Remember where your hotkeys are and follow a system (for example: 1x1’ing). As soon as your muscle memory remembers this system it will become easier and easier to adapt to your enemy. 


I’m 100% sure I forgot some good tips/strategies and I’m in no way a “pro” at this game, these are just my tips on how to win more and definitely improve your KD percentage. I hope you guys appreciate this information and I’d love some constructive feedback!

Fortnite has shown signs of going down hill. None on us obviously want that. It made me realize the one thing that will kill fortnite. And that epic themselves. They have been so busy adding new items, weapons, and gamemodes, along with “fixing” stuff that is already fixed or wasn’t broken in the first placed that they are introducing a countless number of bugs and glitches in each new update. Epic needs to slow down. They need to prioritize the game first. We all love me items and ltm’s, but I think the majority of us would prefer the game to be fixed and run smooth with healthy gameplay first. This new update was a complete step backwards in the direction we need to be going. They fixed bug, but introduced many more, the changed the game with something that none of us asked for and that we didnt need in the first place. Epic needs to get their priorities straight.

With the last couple of patches (guided missile) &amp; especially with today's patch with the port of fort &amp; the weapon delay switch, it's clear the direction Epic is going for Fortnite is a slow more campy pace of gameplay.

The thing is one of the main appeals of Fortnite that set it apart from other Battle Royale games previous to FN such as pubg, h1z1, etc...
is Fortnite's fast paced aggressive gamestyle. Likewise, other BR games are starting to take note of the fast paced gamestyle such as Darwin's project. It's clear that people enjoy the fast paced gameplay more than the slower campy tactical style of gameplay.

 I'm just warning Epic to look in the future of FN, cause eventually with enough updates to further slow down the game, people will get tired of the slow paced gameplay &amp; move onto a better BR game.",FortNiteBR

I’m writing this because first, listen to the pros about game ideas, because they’ve played the game much more than all of us on reddit! 

I think you’ve tried to balance the game between the players who build and the players who dont! Which is not a good idea, because the game is a fast based game, it’s defintley not a slow ass game which it has been after this update. The game is literally just fun for the beginners, right now.

My Suggestion
Bring back the old switching time, and add ”ranked games (solo)” with differnet queues, 
Example: Bronze Queue, Silver Queue, Gold Queue, Platinum Queue, Diamond Queue, Master Queue.
Which will make the game fun for both good and new players.
It should be like this, the first 10 games you play will choose which rank you’ll start in, based on kills and wins.
It’ll make it easier for beginners to learn the game, and the good players can have fun and build battle each other, the game would be more serious to.

 Also there's still some sort of glitch where turbo build doesn't work when holding down the button for some reason which I'll post on the bug form in a moment.

Another point I wanna make is, when pulling out your building mode, if you press the trigger before the wall comes up the turbo build doesn't engage, and you must let off and re-press the trigger to get it to start building...

I just finished playing a couple of games in which the last circles had multiple dudes in port a fort already camping inside. I don't know if it's just me or what, but I'm feeling as if the game is going into the direction of a slower and more campy style catering to less skilled players, instead of a exciting fast paced game. 

The port a fort, gives a player a instant fort instead of practicing their building skills.  I am very positive you will all experience what I did later today if you have not played yet. A bunch of port a fort in the last circle with nobody moving. 

Usually in the last circles there should be a person lucky enough to have already built a base in it because they were there first, and then a person who has to rush because the the first guy won't let you build your base, and of course a bush wookie. Now all I see are a bunch of quiet port a forts.

Adding onto why port a fort is bad is, usually newer players who camp, will usually camp inside a building or bush and not build. They will usually lose to somehow who knows how to build. Now they have the option to have a base without learning how to really build one. If you have to camp in a base, you should learn to build one in order to improve.

The guided missile was another addition I felt promoted a slower and campy style for both sides. The shooter has to camp somewhere hidden while shooting it, and the target has to instantly build 4 walls and a roof instantly when they hear it. Both players has to camp. 

Another bad change was the slow equip speed. Now it's very hard to just take out your shotgun/sniper if you see a person right away. Taking away the skill gap of having quick reactions, and giving the target more chances to escape.

I'm not scared of a higher skill gap game, what I'm scared is Epic catering to new players so much that they lower the skill gap with each new addition. Making the game slower, more campy and ultimately less enjoyable. ",FortNiteBR

* Double pump meta
* Instakills with a headshot to a player with 200hp 
* Double pump fix that added delay when pulling out the pump after 1 shot.
* The meta is just shotguns
* 9 damage with my pump???
* Rarity changes on the pump (green/blue), doesn't matter because they're still found everywhere.
* The v3.5 delay added to multiple weapons. Likely to encourage a change in meta


There's probably more...

So what if we just got rid of the pump? Do we even need it anymore? We have tac and heavy shotguns now and the pump seems to be causing more problems than it's worth at this point. Without the pump you no longer have the threat of the double pump, which may mean the delay on weapon switching is removed. 

It would mean a serious change in meta, as you could no longer rush into a battle with your pump out, hoping for that easy quick kill. You'd be free to use different loadouts! Those pissed off by getting killed by a pump shot to the face wont have to worry about it anymore either. Imagine a more fair gunfight where instead of being 1 shot, you could be 2 shot by a tac/heavy. Haha. 

I understand people who defend the pump and want to keep it in the game...I'm one of them...but we seriously just don't need it anymore. 2 weeks after it's gone, you won't even care anymore. It's causing way more harm than good and I think it'd just be easier if it was retired to the vault.

To me, the aggressive playstyle is fun but it has its drawbacks like getting shot in the back from 4 different directions. I could be alone here but I just think they should try to develop more items like the impulse grenades that have a crazy amount of utility rather than items that allow people to sit and camp all game, only moving when the storm forces them out.

If we dropped pyramids, one of the bumpers could be used for material/trap switch.

I think the game would be streamlined by focussing on walls, ramp and floor (aka roof)

Let's accept this.","Every time the devs made certain changes I was initially very frustrated because Id think to myself ""why did I waste time getting good at a core game mechanic or tactic...and now they added some auto ability or nerf"". But short of a separate game client for more serious play, Fortnite will always be a casual game focused on making sure young players on all platforms have a survival chance against average players. 

And think about it. The community shouted down the idea of skill-based matchmaking. So when the devs have to worry about young kids having a good time in their game...theyll make these ""noob"" friendly changes to make sure those kids arent constantly stomped in the game. I saw a lot of people today griping about the delayed weapon switching...so I was motivated to post.


My concerns previously were:

**Bloom/RNG Shooting** -

After seeing how the newly implemented Shooting Model 1 allows for ghost peaking laser shots...are we not surprised that Shooting Model 2 will likely never release. If youre a veteran of the FPS genre, we can understand why EPIC wouldnt want recoil and better accuracy on the aim reticles.

I do dislike that sometimes someone spraying me can get a couple of lucky headshots, while my on target shots wizz right by them...but there's a target audience for the devs to worry about.


**Turbo-Building, and Auto Material Change** - 

I was proud of the practice I put into my building. Manual building was not just about spam clicking...it was about timing your button presses, and placing them in the right spots to avoid being out-built, or trapping yourself under my stairs. It took practice to properly time your clicks in between your character movements, as well as placing clicks at the right time when changing from walls to stairs to floors.

Now its just simply hold left-click to paint buildings, and you have less worry about making mistakes. There's much less work to do, and less muscle memory too. Also you do not have to pay attention to when a particular material will run out.  The skill gap was shrunken when all this was added...and I felt a bit salty that I spent so much time practicing building towers and my combat tactics. Time felt wasted in a way.

**Boogie Bombs** -

Want a chance at a 1 shot kill? Wanna disco disco with a new buddy? Just hit em with a disco bomb and one pump him in the face.

Yes they nerfed Boogie bombs, but it still feels cheap when I one shot kill someone who cant defend themselves. And its maddening when it happens to me as well.

**Port-A-Forts** -

Losing a close range battle? Simply throw down an insta-3story-tower bomb. Instant high ground, and with your enemy below you, you can either heal, or shoot him in the face if he builds up or attempts to shoot out the bottom of your new base.

Is someone pushing your manually built tower and you noticed him a little late? Well hey, no need to learn to counter build floors to block his ascent. No need to tower up to outbuild him either. Just throw down an instant-PortaFort and your tower will now be three stories higher. 

**Weapon Switching Delays** -

Double shotties? Double Pistols? Quick scoping with sniper rifles? Nah, no need for that anymore. We dont want you putting down new players that quickly or they will quit the game. We need a level playing field here.

I digress yall. Ive just accepted the game will become more casual...and skill gaps or competitive play is a secondary thought for EPIC. And considering how focused they are on cross play, my dream of a seperate game client for more serious play wont happen.

But it does stink that with some of these changes in the game, I keep asking myself why do I put time into getting better? Ive never played other shooters that made me feel like my time learning certain skills were being wasted or sometimes actively negated by the development team changes.",FortNiteBR

Standard mode: How Fortnite is now, with all of the gimmicks and skillgap-closing crutches (guided missiles, port-a-forts, weapon swap delays, turbo-building, etc.).

It's obvious why the game is heading in the direction of the ladder. There's only so many times a casual player can get built over and double pumped by a skilled player before he/she gets fed up and goes back to playing Call of Duty. Adding the crutches and gimmicks appeals to the masses and is a necessary business decision for Epic Games.

The whole fortnite community is getting toxic af and it's honestly becoming annoying as hell.
The reason you might ask? Killing downed enemies!

When I started playing this game many months ago it wasn't that much of a problem, you would eventually get killed by a player but it was like once every 10 games. I mean hell, I myself am guilty of killing downed enemies. But now it's getting out of hand. More and more often I come across players who down me or one of my teammates and while 3 other people shoot at him he continues to shoot at the person on the ground just to verify his kill. 
Look at what we've become Reddit! We've become MONSTERS whose only purpose in life is ruining other peoples fortnite experience. I get it when you really have to kill the enemy (e.g. when you're running low on mats/ammo or he's been sitting right next to your like a good little dog and you want to end his suffering because his last teammate probably was a nomic dropping at tilted while the entire squad went to retail row) 

So my plea to everyone reading this: please, in the name of every fortnite player who just wants to play some squads with his mates, stop killing defenseless downed enemies. They can't shoot you and they'll still die sooner or later. ",FortNiteBR

many issues with controller, simple fixes. 

A lot of people may not feel this affects them as they might either be the common keyboard/mouse player or just the casual player who doesn't mind. I have over 600 hours played on Fortnite, all on PC using a controller and I have come numb to the issues that controller players face as its seemed that they would never be solved. V3.5.0 patch attempted to solve some controller needs, and while I feel that its a step in the right direction, still needs a lot of work.

**Issues with Builder Pro controller layout:**

* (PROBLEM) While running; switching to build &gt; hitting left trigger for ramp registers for a split second that you are aiming, stopping your run in place into a walk

* (SOLUTION) Edit the already existing combat pro layout; allow players to remap the order of building pieces OR allow us to remap the buttons for building pieces to any available buttons on the controller as a keyboard can.

**Sensitivity:**

* (PROBLEM) There's 2 main mechanics in Fortnite, combat side and building side. A lower sensitivity compliments aiming and degrades building abilities while a higher sensitivity compliments building and degrades aiming abilities. 

* (SOLUTION) Separate sensitivity settings for when in/out of building. 

**Aim Assist:**

* (PROBLEM) Now this might be an unsolvable issue, however I still feel at a massive disadvantage sometimes. Mouse players have the wonderful ability to aim perfectly through windows, while controller players lack aim assist through windows making it very hard to hit shots.

* (SOLUTION) Add aim assist through SOME objects like big windows etc. 

**Empty buttons:**

* (PROBLEM) Keyboards have tons of empty keys that are able to be mapped.

* (SOLUTION) Allow controller users to use our unusable buttons (like d-pad) to be mapped to weapon slots, building pieces, etc. 

Will add more to come as suggestions arise.

Shotguns were way too dominant, not because of their damage individually, dominant as it was ALMOST mandatory to rock two shotguns. That should not happen. 

It has nothing to do with skill, if you have skill you’d easily be able to find a way to counter this, it’s not as clunky as anyone claims. Swapping from a shotgun to smg is fine but you should not be swapping from shotgun to shotgun. 

I think heavy burst damage (more then just an individual shotgun or rocket) is very bad for this game considering you can already one shot someone with full health and shield with a good shot. Which is another reason why people rocked more then one shotgun, so if they miss that first head shot and the dude gets some
 Shots on you, you can still swap and get a chance for that one shot headshot..

The only reason this post is being made is because I am passionate about the game and Id hate to see it fail. Currently, epic have the mindset of developing patches that can help out players with low skill abilities. 

For me, this is exactly what is going to kill the game for me. Without sounding too cocky, I am a PS4 player that would be put under the category of better than average player. My playstyle is all out aggresive and most games I can pull off 15+ with no initiative to camp.

Due to this new update I have died countless times because of the weapon switch cooldown and am currently struggling to showcase my abilities and improve. The game is getting more and more noob friendly as time goes on, putting all fast paced players back in a cage. Epic have now put a maximized skill gap in the game. 

Players can no longer push boundaries.

I really do hope they remove this awful mechanic as it is really turning me off playing. The fast pace action packed game we once used to know is gone. Bring the good times back plz.",FortNiteBR

Anyway, here are my specs:

Nvidia Quadro FX 380
4GB ram
256mb VRam 
Intel i3 Processor, OS is Windows 7.

I Hope i can run it even with max 30 fps on lowest settings, if not, i will probably wait for early access to end and see if there's any change in optimization, any help would be appreciated.",FortNiteBR

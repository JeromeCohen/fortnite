I thought it was a prank until they sent me pics. I checked my account in Fortnite tracker and it shows matches played 10 mins ago. What should I do? Epic will probably respond in 2 weeks.

So I envy all those with Black Knight and John Wick skins while they emote Best Friends or Take the L.

I didn't devote enough time in Season 4 to unlock my Omega skins full color set and I wasn't good enough to get the victory umbrella. 

Come season 5 I got the victory beach umbrella and I fully unlocked Ragnarok but it didn't feel complete cause I did not get the Tomatohead and its challenges.

So I promised to get everything done in Season 6. What would you consider proof to be called a Season 6 OG player?

1. The Victory Webrella
2. Fully unlocked Dire Skin
3. The Fortnitemares Train Glider
4. Optionally, the 35 Tier glitch
5. Witnessed Calamity's jiggle
6. Screenshot of you with the in event Butterfly
7. All hidden banners
8. Level 100 banner spray and emoticon
9. Optionally the Galaxy Skin Set 
10. The Summiit Striker starter set
11. Skull Ranger and its Backbling
12. A.I.M. and E.L.I.M.

Anything I missed?",FortNiteBR

 A  balance to turret health makes no difference because in order not to get absolutely lasered i have to turbo build  constantly and when im trying to rotate to zone even my triple ramp takes 2 seconds to go down and im getting residually tagged as i fall and place walls.    

And to make matters worse even if I did have time to take shots at the people in the turrets controller aim locks to the base of the turret no matter how much i try and get it to move up.

As well, maybe tune down the production rate of new major updates since a lot of bugs are introduced with each one, I know this is pretty much avoidable, but I'm not just speaking for myself here when I say we would rather have a week or maybe two dedicated to fixing the issues in this game. 

&amp;#x200B;

\#Currently, the major bugs include: 

Models of people are rendering way too big

Teleporting under the ground with quadcrashers

The hitbox of the turret being too big and thus impossible to counter

The game being pretty much unplayable for the entirety of Africa and some of west Asia

Emoting in the Lobby

Player models not rendering in the lobby

Overall quality of the servers, shots not registering, sudden lag spikes, packet loss.

Walls gaining full health

Players remaining alive after death.

&amp;#x200B;

\#Balance changes that 'I' think would help this game:

Reduction of bloom massively on all guns but still noticeable

Introduction of slight recoil/kick on guns

Increase spawn rate of launch pads, decrease chillers

Allow to redeploy glider with balloons

Turret damage needs to go down from 40 to like 30 it is way too powerful and pretty much uncounterable

Scaling materials from llamas with number of people in party, 200 solos, 400, duos, 600 squads

Increase headshot damage of shotguns

slightly reduce fall damage

Lower trap damage to 125

&amp;#x200B;

These are just the main ones I could pick off from my game-play and posts on this sub, although small inconsistencies and other bugs do happen at a rate that I think is unacceptable for a company that made 1 billion dollars. Just focus on these for a week, make the game fun in its current state then start adding some new weapons and changes

I queued up for the next game feeling pretty confident. Little did I know that I would spend the next hour and a half desperately trying to get 4 more points while dealing with

1. 5 minute queue times (every time I died!)
2. Super sweaty players that hid in a box the entire game to get points
3. 70 people lobbies (this is a bad thing because getting points from kills was impossible)

I never got my 4 points. I'm not the best at this game or anything, but I'd consider myself well above average. This was ridiculous. I was hoping that these tournaments would give the average joe a better chance at winning competitions. Which would mean it would be a little easier for me, but I couldn't even manage to do it. I love the scavenger gamemode on its own and 100% think it should be an LTM so maybe that's why this annoyed me so much. I couldn't enjoy the gamemode once I got to 26 points. I really don't think these cups need ranked matchmaking. There are plenty of good players in regular pubs. It's not like it's a walk in the park to win unranked games. I'd say the 5 minute queue times were by far the most frustrating part, however. It made dying that much more annoying. Anyway, let me know what you guys think. ",FortNiteBR

I would go to school, then practice, then home and play. I would do my best to get better at building and fighting; eventually I got good around mid-late season 3, and then season 4 happened. We lost dusty and the factories (the best landing spot, do not @ me”. Season 4 didn’t push me away, but it did make me miss the original game. I missed that era where we didn’t have 12 year olds obsessed with our game, and we didn’t have people spend hundreds to get every skin, but that changed with the introduction of Divot. When divot happened the media got wind of this game and they caused an influx of kids and streamers to flood the lobbies; wait time got longer, updates got larger, skill gaps arose. With the rise in skill gaps, Epic decided that this game was going to be easy for everyone, and not just us who put in time. I hated this. I hated the removal of double pump, the changes to the beautiful map, etc. You guys get it; I used to play it a little too much, but once season 4 cam and went I’ve easy off.

They should be removed from all large scale game modes.,"Before you all say ""oh well you're probably trash"" or ""git gud"" or ""just build, lol"", I did build. I'm not great, but I'm not bad. On top of that, It's insane that these are in a large scale mode like disco domination. The turrets are miniguns with INSANE range. I think my highest distance kill with one is 180m. I watched four people grind kills on my team because the opponents had a higher mountain than ours. The hitboxes are terrible. The overheat is too short. They kill me in THREE SHOTS. The range is insane. The damage falloff is terrible. The bloom is small enough to hit someone accurately from over 150m. They have too much health. They. Are. Over. Powered. On top of all that, they shred builds. Overall, this is just my two cents, and we could have a friendly discussion about this kind of thing. I don't want the turret removed from all modes, I want it to be removed from large scale game modes where you can camp on the high ground and get free kills on people who are gliding in, or by long distance third partying. 

TL;DR

Please Epic, remove the mounted turrets from large scale modes, nerf them, reduce the range, fix the hitbox, or something. PLEASE.",FortNiteBR

All of my posts have mostly gone unnoticed. I’m sure many more of them will continue to be buried under the memes, great plays, and other amazing ideas that manifest on this sub, and that’s okay. 

In building awareness and getting Epic to remedy the situation, I will continue to post every week on Friday, about the cataclysmic state the Switch version of the game is in.

It is borderline unplayable. Textures aren’t loading in, players are invisible, frames drop down below 10 even in 1v1s, and excessive server side lag.

There is no reason that the mobile version of the game on iOS and Android are more stable than a dedicated gaming console.

Hardware limitations in mind, you committed to bringing this game to the Switch. So commit, Epic.",FortNiteBR

You would be able to move around while holding it, but would not be able to move too far from the edge, else it would be cancelled (allows you to dodge bullets). Imo that would make up for the mobility issues some are having due to the storm, and yet again would allow people to kill others with fall damage as well. As for third partying, I believe the implementation of +50hp/shield for kill would make it less of a problem. Also increase drop rate of jump pads so people can rotate faster during end game, or lower the wait time on glider deploy as zone gets smaller (maybe even 5s first zone and then up to 1s on fifth?).

* Mascot health decreased from 200k to 100k

* Decreased Mounted Turret drop rate by 50%

* Added the timer of Storm 4 to Storm 3.

 * This means there will only be 3 total Storm Circles.

* Reduced the “Auto Mascot Damage” by 40%

 * Auto Mascot damage is applied to each teams Mascot at set intervals so that matches will auto resolve within a set time frame if neither team is able to destroy the enemies Mascot.
Auto Mascot damage starts ticking 5 minutes after Storm Circle 2.

So I'm primarily an XBOX player. I've been playing since roughly the end of season 1. So about a year now. I recently installed mobile fortnite as a way to get daily challenges and stuff like that when I can't get to my xbox for a day from being on vacation or whatever. I'm decent on xbox. I've got over 100 solo wins with about a 2 K/D across all modes.

I've passively played a few games on mobile since I installed it. I signed on today to try to do some challenges while I'm at work and really tried to play it in earnest, and I gotta say, it's a really really bad experience for me. 

First question is, how does anyone aim? I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn when I'm playing on mobile. I'm a decent shot on xbox and can hit a couple good snipes from time to time. But this is brutally difficult. Meanwhile, everyone else seems to have the accuracy I have on xbox while playing on mobile. It's like snap accuracy and they hit most shots barring bloom. Meanwhile, I'm missing 50 feet to the right and then try to get back to center and end up missing 50 feet to the left due to overcompensation. I do aim down sights on mobile, so its not that. 

Second question, how does everyone build so fast? It takes me at least 2-3 seconds to figure out where the build buttons are to even put up a simple wall. And dont get me started on trying to switch to a ramp. But I just died to someone who aggressively pushed me with a wall/ramp combo after hitting me with his first snipe shot. How is that even possible on mobile? 

Third, and possibly most importantly, why is everyone trying so hard on mobile? I was literally running around with a pick axe in hand just trying to get from haunted hills to lazy links for the challenge. No mats. No guns. Clearly not a threat to hurt anyone or win the game. This guy pushed me with the shockwave grenades and a shotgun and I didn't get the challenge done. Are there sweats on mobile too? Stats dont count. K/D isnt tracked. Wins dont matter. The overall gameplay is clunky AF. Why? Just let me awkwardly do my challenge and die to the storm with some dignity.

I think the obvious answer to most of these questions is, ""just practice, and you'll be able to do that on mobile as well"". The thing is, these people are playing at PC and/or console level in my opinion. It doesn't matter how much time I spend practicing, I dont think I have the ability to do that on my phone. Is there some controller for mobile I'm not aware of? Am I being put in lobbies with PC players?

I did this because I was looking for better performance, from myself and the platform I was playing on. I feel like I am one of the most fit individuals to answer this question since I understand the mechanics of aim assist, in Fortnite and how it plays against a mouse and keyboard. Now before I go into any of the details on aim assist, I would like to remind everyone we shouldn't be arguing anything outside the question of, 

""Does aim assist give controller players an advantage against keyboard, and mouse players?""
I am going to start by debunking a few myths at first to help rid you of any unsure opinions some of you have in mind.


Aim assist is a weaker aimbot
This simply isn’t true, if anything aim assist isn’t as easy as spamming the aim button, and seeing it drag towards the enemies head. If this were the case all console players would be great at aiming and believe me, there are many of them can’t hit a shot to save their life. Aiming is a skill even in console, and certain streamers like nickmercs, ayden, and upshall all praised for it time and time again.


2) Aim assist doesn't have disadvantages.
This is also false, aim assist has many disadvantages most people don’t even know of.


a) Sniping with aim assist is not easy especially in a game where you have to lead your enemies. Aim assist becomes counterproductive, the reticle will always pull towards the target, making it harder to lead them, and getting use to pulling the reticle against that resistance is a learning curve.

b) Sometimes aim assist will cause you to hit the wrong person, this doesn’t mean the moment you aim down sights, your reticle goes on another target you had no idea was there when initially aiming at someone else, but a common problem I ran into on controller was if a downed player was in front of another enemy my reticle would get dragged somewhere in the middle if my aim wasn’t perfect. Aim assist doesn’t prioritize knocked or standing up players.

c) You can become very reliant on aim assist. An issue still not fixed for controller players is aim assist through windows. Its super frustrating to aim down sights at an easy target in tilted and only be left with a reticle near impossible to control.

3) Controller players will be fine without aim assist
This isn’t right. When you're using nothing but your two thumbs for character movement and reticle placement it becomes extremely difficult to aim. On a mouse you have more control since your entire arm/hand is responsible for reticle movement. Don’t believe me? Try eating dinner with only your thumbs instead of your entire hand. Like it or not your hand is more efficient when all of its parts are in use.

Now, the question rises again, ""Does aim assist give controller players an advantage against keyboard, and mouse players?""

The keyword here is “unfair”, defining unfair has to be a judgement made with your knowledge of fortnite. In fortnite, aiming is important, but there are many other variables that have an affect on a fight and ultimately judge the outcome whether its RNG or skill based. For example, if Ghost Aydan were to play against a pc player in a skirmish, out build him, and out maneuver him, is he not deserving of the kill? If the pc players turns on him and oneshots him, do we blame the precise accuracy that the mouse allows you to have?

You might say Aim assist can make up for a bad play made by console player, for example a pc player outplays his opponent (a controller player) in every aspect of the fight, only to get shotgunned for 185 damage. Many people will claim this is aim assist at work, and you aren't wrong whenever aiming down sights aim assist is in the game at that moment, but having your reticle close enough for aim assist to proc that number is no easy task, for the amount of reticle control you lose using your thumbs to aim, aim assist is a rather small compensation for that.

I like TSM Myths analysis on the controller. The one thing where I can say aim assist comes in handy is tracking, spamming the aim button on a fast moving target does indeed help a controller player hit his or her shots. Please keep in mind controller players do not have the  same abilities on overall aiming as a mouse and keyboard player, and if aim assist were altered in anyway it would throw off all their aim completely. I understand all it takes at times is a player to have good tracking for a moment and kill their opponent but if we are going to take away or suppress the one thing that makes a controller worth using for some people unwilling to make the switch, and completely undermine all the advantages that comes with a mouse and keyboard, and the disadvantages the controller player is left with then we are not fixing a problem we are only creating one.

I would just like to say, since we are on the competitive subreddit, and since we are discussing the players of the highest skill level, someone who has perfected mouse and keyboard, is a lot more deadly, than the one that has perfected their skills on a controller, especially when talking about precision. Whatever Epic decides to do, there is simply no way to appease both sides, I invite anyone to ask me any question or concerns they might have. I hope I helped shed some light on this topic. Thank you!

No. You are supposed to win, that’s the whole point of the game. If you don’t like the idea of it, you can try not to take damage in battles, or just not play the game.

This is why it is slipping into obscurity and will be overtaken by the next thing.,"Down vote all you want because I'm sure all the fanboy kiddies that love to run, bunny hop, and spam shotguns will catch feelings but this is why people hate and bash this game. You hear it all the time about inconsistent shotgun hit numbers, bhops, etc. but really, watch this. I've added [video 1 from my perspective](https://streamable.com/spmd4) and [video 2 from opponent perspective](https://streamable.com/jjjts). I admit this is not my best effort and I made several poor choices.. explosive aim was a little off BUT.. major BUT.. WTF is up with the stupidity of the game itself. Here are my gripes..

Opponent received 0 damage from the three RPG's. A single RPG explosion should decimate a tree or wall of any type, particularly wood walls, and as you can see the burst appears on the other side of the tree and wall. If not one, at least two should eliminate or seriously injure an opponent but three?!? Come the fuck on! First of all, I don't think the size of the RPG explosion (or any explosion for that matter) is large enough, especially in comparison to so many other lopsided things such as jumping height/distance or considering the spray size of shotguns. But of course a partial pump shotgun blast from 25-30m knocks me down 60 health in the corridor. Of course a sprinting person can dart past, around, and over 3 RPG and 3 clinger explosions with no damage, close on me, and make two more deadly shotgun shots from 20m and 15m away while jumping in the air more than double their own height. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some other thoughts not applicable to this clip but just about the state of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate that pickax damage went up from 10 to 20 recently. Okay so why if you squarely run someone over with a quadcrasher in the middle of a turbo boost is the damage only 30?!?! GTFO here with that dumbshit! That's at least as deadly as a shotgun body shot from pointblank range.

&amp;#x200B;

Keyboard/Mouse are at way too much of an advantage. Limit the number of keys available to be used for various functions just like the typical controller would be. I don't care what keys you use or how you bind them, just no more than 16 so that the number of steps in order to be able to do every combination of functions is the same.

&amp;#x200B;

AR hits are WAY too weak. Again, compared to a pump shotgun from 20m an AR hit should be 60 body 120 head even with common grade. Pumps are getting like 70 body 170 head and these are pellets not buckshots or bullets. Get real!  No wonder shot running and gunning kids come right at people without fear, hopping about, and popping off overhead shotty kills. At least make the AR hits slow the opponent so they cant rush you from 40m and beat your 8 AR hits with 2 shotgun blasts. HOLYSHIT!

&amp;#x200B;

Glider redeploy was cool for a while and now it's gone except when you use a launch pad or rift... SO WHY NOT BALLOONS from the same height range that those two items place you at?? It's so inconsistent that the game is retarded.

My Suggestions:

1. Make Shotgun hitboxes more consistent.With that comes more damage and reliability on the shotgun.
2. Remove single Pump delay .
3. Remove bloom and replace with easy recoil system.
4. Give 25hp/shield per Elimination.
5. Bring back Bounce Pads in stacks of 1. This prevents spamming it .
6. Decrease Launchpads rarity slightly.
7. Reduce trap damage to 100. But make traps consistent .
8. Increase material gain slightly and reduce the max. cap slightly.
9. Have very few but constant rift spots on the edges of the map.
10. Enable Glider Redeploy for Balloons only.
11. Replace the Ice Trap with an actual trap that does dps similar to stink nades . (Or at least vault it)
12. Reduce overall fall damage slightly.

A lot of people are posting about the recent change with the glider redeploy being removed. Many are saying that they originally wanted the glider redeploy removed but are now upset that it’s gone.  I think that this highlights that there needs to be some sort of happy medium. 

Personally I found glider redeploy to be a bit ridiculous. Benefits included being able to rotate quickly, take virtually no fall damage and be able to engage/disengage whenever needed. For me, this made the map feel a lot smaller than it does now that we are back to running, etc. 

The drawbacks were huge though too.  Build fights were totally diminished due to the fact that you could get into a ridiculous fight and the person could disengage by jumping off, resulting in spending a ton more mats than necessary. You could chase and eventually get the kill but if the fight lasts more than 10 seconds you better hope you took no damage because you are about to get third partied out the ass and the odds of getting any real healing off is slim. And even if you didn’t take damage how many mats do you even have left to fend off the swarm of players who are flying towards the sound of gunfire. 

I am personally happy to see people dying to the storm again and dying from fall damage. Proper rotation is a key skill that needs to be developed and being able to build up three ramps and glide off whenever you feel like it devalues this and building a sky base needs to have a risk reward aspect. 

Ultimately I think unlimited glider redeploy does more damage than good. If anything I think a version with some sort of cool down would be best (I know I’m not the first to suggest this). Maybe something along the lines of 10 sec or more. This would make it so redeploy is more strategy based and you really don’t want to waste it. Based on people’s reaction to redeploy being removed it seems that most people would be happy with some sort of intermediate option. 

Maybe epic could come up with some other utility/mobility item that could help with this issue as well. I personally would love to see the bounce pads back again. This item was skill based and could prevent you from taking fall damage but didn’t eliminate it entirely because of the skill and positional sense required to utilize it to its full extent. You could use it to rotate out of the storm if you weren’t paying attention or got caught in a bad fight. Of course there are vehicles too but these are much louder than gliding in on someone. 

TLDR: The game feels way slower again now that redeploy is gone and is painfully much more obvious now. Unlimited redeploying is on the other extreme of this spectrum. This is reflected in the community not being happy with or without redeploy. There needs to be a happy medium. 

What do you think? Let’s try and keep it friendly. ",FortNiteBR

1. Make Shotgun hitboxes more consistent.With that comes more damage and reliability on the shotgun.
2. Remove single Pump delay .
3. Remove bloom and replace with easy recoil system.
4. Give 25hp/shield per Elimination.
5. Bring back Bounce Pads in stacks of 1. This prevents spamming it .
6. Decrease Launchpads rarity slightly.
7. Reduce trap damage to 100. But make traps consistent . 
8. Increase material gain slightly and reduce the max. cap slightly.
9. Have very few but constant rift spots on the edges of the map.
10. Enable Glider Redeploy for Balloons only.
11. Replace the Ice Trap with an actual trap that does dps similar to stink nades . (Or at least vault it)
12. Reduce overall fall damage slightly.

Did i miss something ? let me know what you think and what your suggestions are .",FortNiteBR

Last night I tried to solo squad only to be met end game with a team of 4, 3 of them on mounted turrets and 1 pushing and build battling me. The turrets were 150 meters away, and every time I shot, the bullets got absorbed by the machine.

The worst part was I was getting hit for 40s and 80s by the turrets from that far out. There is no reason this thing should have less fall off damage than a heavy AR.

I experienced them once in scrims last night as well. It was a 4v4, one of my teammates got picked by a sniper.  Immediately They set up 2 mounted turrets from maybe 75 meters away, and still without a sniper you can’t fight back. The mounted turret eats all the damage. 

Suggestions on how to fix: vault, change the output damage to 18/36, and change the fall off damage to 5/10.  Or vault.

Its hard for me to believe, but playing the game again without them just seems boring. I could literally loot Snobby and meet up with the boys in Shifty in a matter of minutes, all while avoiding the circle. Now, if you take too long to loot and dont have a launch pad or these balloons that absolutely suck, plus respawn rate for launch pads being low due to the now various items in the game, you’re screwed. 

Epic, look, I dont typically post, but I think you struck a great idea with this one and im upset enough to take the time to say something because it was removed. I think you let some players and famous streamers and youtubers persuade you to remove it. Not everyone has to like it, but you only gave it a short amount of time to grow on people. You didn’t have an overwhelming amount of people begging you to take it down. Sure, this subreddit was full of complainers, but thats what happens in subreddits for video games. People get on here to read, watch clips, and complain.  I don’t really think you gave people enough time to get used to it.

I think I speak for a lot of players when i say glider redeployment really changed this game for the better. It caught the attention of many, including me. In fact, it pulled me away from RDR2 and these newer games after i had stopped playing due to boredom with this game. It was a feature i was hoping would come to this game. It brought back that excitement. I know people say they are getting tired of someone flying in and third partying them, but that happens without gliders already. Thats a part of battle royale games. 

So, Epic, I plead to you, please bring back the glider redeployment...please.

i played like 4 games and all  games ended like this.

A turret like that is ok but it needs to be balanced and not have a droprate of 120%. Also it is almost impossible to kill someone who is sitting in that thing.

415,Floarul,1542268783,9x98b0,28,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9x98b0/epic_lets_discuss_the_game/,1,"Epic, let’s discuss the game","I’ve been a player since season 2, and have hardly touched other games since last December because I love this game so much. At its core, Fortnite is one of the all time greatest games. That said, I think it’s safe to say nobody’s having much fun anymore. I think it’s safe to say this game goes through far to many and unnecessary changes

One of the biggest issues Epic seems to struggle with is really trying there hardest to cater to the casual player. This started long ago when they started to add items such as the port o fort and mini gun. Then they proceeded to try and make farming take longer to stop people from building. The constant nerfs to building didn’t go over well at all and instead of directly nerfing building, they’ve indirectly effected it by adding re-deploy, making subs rip structures, making explosives stupid overpowered, and now we have a turret that is honestly just ridiculous. Epic let me tell you something that Daequan said an it’s straight facts. You could give Timmy no thumbs a black whole device and I’d still kill him. The things you do don’t really help bad players because good players can abuse in game features too. It just makes the game not fun for anyone. Do you remember why your game blew up? It’s because it was simple, and FUN. Now it’s far to oversaturated and so much BS that makes it not fun. Literally half my deaths now a days I feel like are total jokes. That’s not good for a game because I know many people agree.

To add to this, it seems like Epic is trying to constantly push forward without looking back, and while I think we can all agree that’s awesome, it’s getting to a point where it’s gone to far. This game has so many issues and instead of focusing on the gameplay, you add new things to keep the meta in constant change, which also is t good for a game. How can casuals ever have fun when new things are added so often that they can’t keep up? You literally have to eat, sleep and grind Fortnite to know what got vaulted, what got added, or what’s new. It’s almost like y’all are sitting in your office writing down ideas and putting them in a box and randomly picking what gets added next to see what will stick and what will fail. I remember the initial issue people had with constantly adding features and y’all said you’d go on a by weekly schedule. 1 week fixed bugs, the next adds something new. You lied off the rip because bugs only get fixed by weekly, while you add something new weekly still. Please for the love of god slow down and start thinking with care and integrity over more and more money.

Now I’m not going to sit and say I’m leaving because I’m not (yet) but I think it’s safe to say this games really getting out of hand and y’all have no idea how to handle it. I’m aware y’all didn’t plan for this game to blow up like it did and y’all are probably struggling to keep up, but you’re struggling because you’re trying to hard to stay ahead and it’s caused you to fall behind and piss off many people. A lot of my friends have stopped playing simply because it’s not enjoyable unless you play 24/7 because it’s constantly changing. How do you expect people to keep up when only a select few play 24/7. I can keep up because it’s the only game I play, but how do you expect Timmy no thumbs to do well when every week items get removed and something g that totally screws with the meta gets added? Please stop, breathe, and think about where you want this game to go instead of updating to update and seeing what sticks and what doesn’t.

- While removing the gliding down was a pretty good nerf, it's really easy to snipe or shoot people out of the air now and they literally can't do anything against good players who laser you out of the sky (I do this to people ALL the time with snipers or even guns). Risk-reward, I get it, but it just makes it extremely hard to counter play when needed. 

My resolve would be to keep the change and make it so that you can only redeploy from a height that makes you take massive amount of damage. For example, instead of being able to glide off 2 stairs, make it like 6 stories or above only. As well as only being able to glide after 1 second or so after that auto-redeploy glide system that was added this patch to keep it balanced.

- Pickaxe buff. This wasn't necessary nor did it justify needing a buff. So what the fuq was it buffed for? For the memes? Pickaxing is for too strong and troll now. 10 is perfect. Stop with the nonsense. Seriously in Squads you can get auto-kill gangbanged so easily now it's actually funny to do it to people. Even in solo early game it's kind of just annoying. There is no need for this buff.

- Turrets. Get them the fuck out. Please and thank you. Vault them and keep them in separate game modes. Third partying has become way worse and extremely troll now. Not to mention sniping someone with a turret is stupid hard for some reason from over 100m. 

This is my biggest problem with it though, building structures has become impossible with the turret implemented and third partying has become god awful. Oh and Epic Games, you added the overheating system to the Turret which the minigun needs which people were literally complaining about and then make the turret and even bigger annoyance with very little counter-play. 

Thanks for reading, if you're a competitive ish player like me you're probably going to be thinking WTF is this patch, oh and thanks Epic for living up to the Port-A-Shoot Meme, you really do read the reddit... god even casual players are complaining about this shit cuz it's even worse for them.

Obviously you can see in the bottom left corner there is a new part of land where some of the ocean has frozen over, I didn't really know what to put there so I just left it black. You may also sea in Leaky Lake  and all of the corrupted zones there are Christmas trees grown from the remains. Maybe having them in the corrupted zones is too much but we'll see. If you look closely at what was the villain base you can tell that it is slightly different. I made it Santa's workshop, the villain base is kinda fading away so a new location there wouldn't be that crazy. Please tell what else I should add and give me your input.",FortNiteBR

Half the community breathes a sigh of relief, half the community is upset. For better or for worse, glider redeploy is gone for now.

I think it has a lot of promise, but unrestricted access allowed for too much use, and created a lot of the problems people complained about.

I think, if handled smartly, glider redeploy could work - the way I think it could would be this: Glider Durability.

**Glider Durability**

So, what is this idea? Well, after the initial battle bus, you have your glider at 100/100 health. Deploying the glider costs 20, and doesn't initially throw you into skydive (though you can enter it by shutting it and redeploying it). HOWEVER: Deploying out of skydive costs an additional 30 - this makes gliding people much easier to hit, as redeploying will devour their glider's durability. On top of these, gliding itself will cost durability, at a rate of somewhere between 2-6 per second of use, meaning you have to ration that glider out if you're coming to the zone from Snobby.
 
But wait, there's more! 

If someone is gliding, and gets shot, that damage is duplicated to their glider. If the glider's durability hits zero, out of the sky they go to fall to their death. This adds a greater reward for shooting someone in glide mode (which can already be a tricky endeavor). 

Glider health will recover at a much, much slower rate than it's consumed (1 durability every 10 seconds? can be tweaked) and if it breaks, it cannot be redeployed until it fully recovers. 

This also adds openings to add in things such as: glider repair kits, glider reinforcement kits (basically, shields for your glider's health bar). It also adds ways to make other mobility items meaningful again (Balloons would be back in action, jump pads could grant infinite glide (without affecting durability one way or the other), and so forth and so on.

This also adds back an element of risk to skybases, as it will make you vulnerable and cost your glider to get back to the zone (let alone if someone shoots out your glider)

This system, if tweaked and balanced with real testing(the numbers are placeholders, it would obviously need testing) could give us the best of both worlds - a mobility mechanic that is independent from RNG, but without the issues infinite glide brought.


**TL;DR:** Glider redeploy is back, but with durability. Other game mechanics interact with said durability. Lower availability, more risk, more reward for using it smartly. 

Thoughts?

now.  just like then you guys look like a bunch of idiots

 the fortnite community is full of toxic, ignorant, naive, jealous, crap tier personalities.. that are nothing but follow beta sheep who cant come of with any good reason to hate someone or somthing beside some petty reason that helps them fit in with the hate crowd.

obviously have zero clue what the hell they are even talking about

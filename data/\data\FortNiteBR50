That is very well done huh.

I'm in division 6 currently and sometimes I literally run into a very very below average players (worse than me which is very difficult to be at this level) and yet he got there.

So my suggestions are:

* **Separate hype for Solo and Duo queues** 

People can get carried very easily at the state tha game is at right now.

* **Intoduce busfare for Open League**

So not everybody climbs. Only if you are better than at least someone in your lobby you climb.

*Suggestion:*  
*open league - busfare = 1*

*contender league - busfare = 2*

*contender league (division 6) - busfare = 3*

*champion league - busfare = 4 (because if you cannot eliminate at least one player and survive to top 25 why should you stay in the league for the best of the best?)*

* **Balance out floor loot as for comptetitive gameplay**

What do I mean?

*Increase amount of pump shotguns on floor loot, decrease amount of tatical shotguns and over all* ***increase amount of shotguns***

***decrease amount of pistols*** *spawning over all in the game*

***decrease spawnrate of mini-shields and big shields*** *and increase amount of medkits/slurps (will force people to fight more)*

&amp;#x200B;

This is my suggestion, now we can discuss and just saying (SypherPK talked about this on stream and **partically agreed**).",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôm sure Epic would hate to even listen to the casual community again at this point, then they might start having more people purchase V-Bucks or who knows maybe playing the game more to learn a skill gap instead of diminishing it.

Initially, like everyone else, I was upset they removed health on elims, faster harvesting, etc from public matches. But I have tried to understand why Epic did this and why they haven't reverted the changes despite immense push back from the community. This decision clearly served some kind of purpose. After playing public games again the past couple days - it's very clear what Epic hoped would happen is happening. There is still a market for casual and new players. 

I've been playing since season two, have a good amount of wins, but still feel that I am very much an average player. Solo wins were becoming almost impossible to come by in season 7 and season 8 and it wasn't enjoyable. I would play a couple games before burning myself out. 

Public matches are enjoyable again for me. It feels like games from past seasons where I run into complete bots, have random dance encounters, and everyone is in one by one's at the end of games lmao. When I want to play competitively, I'll go to arena. But, for now, public matches are a blast again.

I started playing Fortnite week 4 of season 3, and it's been almost a year and I followed everything about Fortnite since then; 

Fortnite has always been addictive to me; I played it almost everyday since last year, because it WAS a game that I loved; Even thru the spray era, Fortnitemares and even the plane era... never stopped playing it, because there was not a reason to leave it; yes sure there were bugs here and there, but the game was always fun to play;

But ever since 8.2 I've lost interest, I'm not even joking! I was looking for a reason to quit all this time, and didn't find any... but thanks to Epic, I finally have a reason not to play; They keep on adding stupid stuff to the game that no one asked for, and they are not fixing any major bugs... Fortnite devs are not listening to the community anymore and that's what annoys me the most; I won't be downloading today's update, and if you are feeling the same, you shouldn't download it either! Devs won't listen until they feel a major decrease in their daily logins...! Remember how they gave us a free pass and added siphon just to keep players from playing Apex? We need to stop playing so they would listen to us;

It annoys me how every streamer/player talks about how Epic doesn't listen to the community but the first thing they do after downloading is - buying new skins and telling their audience to buy it too, using their code...

318,toljanteripeikko,1554883996,bbjhf7,16,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bbjhf7/state_of_pubs/,8,State of pubs,"Pardon me, not native speaker so much be full of grammars errors.

&amp;#x200B;

But are you happy now playing pubs? 

  
I'm not. Im not big fan of currently meta at late games. It's sitting at box and 3rd party with snipers. Every single game. Specially with this loot pool, if you aren't luck enought to find full hp's, one shot with heavy snipers in achilles will kill you most of the time. This may be unpopular opinion, but they should make some kind of nerf to snipers.  Like bodyshot would be normal, but legs and hands make like 120 or so. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hot drops is only rng. There was rng with siphon too, I agree, but now you need even more. Who finds more shields and dont get 3rd partied is going to win. You can have 5 kills and 7 hp. I thought it was fun to be able to challenge more enemies after kill. People says in this state game is more strategic than what it use to be with siphon. Maybe, but I dont fully argeed this, because now good players can literally push anywhere with those 3000 mats, you don't think anymore that ""I can't push top of that mountain because I could end with 100 mats with no advance gained"". And in this harvesting rate, you have to use so much time to gathering mats, which makes game a lot boring. That 150 mats per kill was good imo. Dont put back that 50hp/shield per kill, but building in this game is the difference with every other BR-games.

&amp;#x200B;

This rng at start creates chances to kill someone good player, and that's good, maybe? But if you want to get better in this game, you need to practice. In BR-games, there are multiple skills what  makes a difference, not everyone have to be playground-warriors. Everyone have chance to get better. Specially late games rotations in pubs seems to be difficult to most players what I have seen. I have played scrims and customs, so I know how to rotate, and many times have seen terrible decisions which leads to choking in late games. Games keep going to develops forward, and players skills as well. We never going to get back what we had like in season 2, hard truth.

&amp;#x200B;

And in late games, I personally don't enjoy a lot killing player with one AR shot. I feel bad for those kills.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't say that siphon is the right answer, but in this state these pubs are just boring. Yes, I can play Arena and I love it, but in Champions I just don't like to ""be sweaty"" all the time, like this subreddit declares. I like to try get better in this game, and like to learn new, because this game is full of tricks. I know, it's not neither fun or educational experience if good players stomps lower skill level players all the time. But I fell love with FN because it has this non-competitive side, I could just play and try new thing in pubs and have fun. Now I don't feel like having as much fun as I use to. Played over 3000 games, and still love these mechanics in game, and not here for bragging with ""my skills"". But this witchhunt what good players gets is nonsense. Some has used time to get good in game what they love. That should be thing to praise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just saying that this game can be much funnier to everyone. Not here to provoke or etc, just saying what I think. Thanks for reading. 

&amp;#x200B;

PS. That sweaty soccer skins and fishstick is good-meme is kind of old and boring. Maybe something new? :-D",FortNiteBR

I found that as the game went on and changes were made, there was still a lot of hate. There always has been and always will be. 

So I say we should take a step back. First off, not everyone can be satisfied, and changes that most people don‚Äôt agree with may be made in preparation for something else down the track. And then there‚Äôs he fact that epic gave us this game. We would not be here if it weren‚Äôt for that. It is extremely hard to fix bugs, add new things and make changes to the game all while listening to the community. They don‚Äôt know how people will react to things they do with the game. So can we all just stop and say a big thank you to epic for everything they‚Äôve done. 

Thank you.

This is not to say console players are worse, it is just that 2cm to aim is not quite enough. 

Instead, they should **NOT** mix lobbies. Making PC players switch to native is not going to help. FOV  in this game will not change how well you can aim. And 2cm is a far cry from what mousepad space PC players usually have.

If FOV is really so unfair, add an FOV slider, so the character doesn‚Äôt actually take up a full third of the screen. You can‚Äôt even see the character‚Äôs foot when looking slightly down in native for fucks sake. 

Some mobile players have a aspect different from 16:9, and therefore they can see more. However I don‚Äôt see any mobile players beating out PC players.

Changing stretched res will not help. Add an FOV slider. There is even a way to abuse the character model by moving to the left in close range, as the character model of the enemy blocks your own.

If they want to improve the experience for console, they could start by actually optimising the game.",FortNiteBR

I don't care what Epic thinks shield per kill did to the game, the truth is that it made the game more fun.

I'm sorry but imo the jungle area really sucks. I probably would have been more happy if they just replaced the snow biome, because the snow biome is stupid and really obnoxious. However i do think its better than the jungle because there isnt 100000 vents everywhere where its impossible to kill anyone without being laser accurate. 

The battle pass, although popular opinion, is absolute garbage, and i dont care for even getting to tier 100 anymore because its so bad, unlike every other season (yeah, even season 4). I've never wanted to not play fortnite so bad. I love this game and have ever since season one, even through the rough times like season 5 spray meta i loved this game. Its just so unappealing and isn't fun at all. 

There are a ton of things to stack up on this (baller, arena ques, and like stated earlier the vents), but what i hate the most is the very controversial recent siphon + mat changes.

In my opinion, these changes made the game the best its ever been, ESPECIALLY right before season 8 (imo map wasnt doodoo). I actually had friends playing the game and was for the most part able to play with a full squad with my friends. Now, I'm lucky if i get to play duos. Im not having fun and none of my friends are having fun. Most of the time we ""play"" fortnite we are all just sitting on the lobby screen while talking and being on our phones. This game is at its absolute worst in my opinion, and i want it to change so badly.

Let's get some things straight. First of all. There was an OFFICIAL comment about the release of the purple variant to original owners of Skull Trooper.

Back then it was THE crazy skin. Nothing looked similarly cool or as stupid (depending on which side of the fence you are on) so it was sold many many times.

&amp;#x200B;

The whole consensus of how early item shops should not get OG variants is really ungrounded.

\- Epic Games probably didn't want to sell Skull Trooper again, but did because of high demand. Look at Ghoul Trooper. She hasn't been re-released.

\- Skull Trooper was available back in pre-season one. Really, does anyone remember how bad this game was back then? It got better around Season 2, but anyone who spent money back in the day can be thanked with some extra items if Epic Games feels like it.

\- ITalkFortnite talks about how everyone is demanding OG edit styles. He should realise, along with others, that most of the OG edit style demands started as a joke, until young and naive people started to make demands because they (somehow) thought skins outside of season 1 could be considered as early-game. Realistically, NO PURPLE SKULL TROOPER owner is crying as badly as people who don't have it. I don't call it jealousy, but people, let it rest. Epic Games wanted to thank original buyers for making it such a financial success that they have given them ONE edit style.

\- If Skull Trooper never came back; both account selling and requests for skull trooper to come back would be going on consistently. It came back. Be happy you got it now. Don't feel entitled to the purple style because ???reasons??? and just use the skin if you like or don't get it.

&amp;#x200B;

I am so sick and tired of people complaining about how Epic Games handles skins and or game mechanics. Stop playing then! I wish it was back like how it was in Season 2, less cry babies and more gamers. Now it's just a toxic community with terms like tryhards and sweats.. give me a break.",FortNiteBR

At the beginning of February, the Admins approached us about finding ways to support content creators and the community. Every day, the sub sees tons of new and unique posts that range from funny Fortnite comics to detailed map breakdowns and strategies. With Reddit's help, we have started a trial process of allowing users to tip content creators who post on the sub for r/FortNiteBR. Reddit and the community both get a small portion of tips.

So far, the Community Jar is just under $50 USD. As such, we are investing the Community Jar directly into a contest for the community!

# r/FortNiteBR Custom Snoo Contest

The Mod Team have decided that we will be hosting a Snoo contest and awarding the winner $50 (I'll round up with some of my own change). It's time for a new sub Snoo! More info to come on this next week - I will post full contest information later once the period is over.

# Community Jar

In the meantime, Reddit is pushing out a new widget on the sidebar on the redesign that allows users to donate directly to the subreddit later today. Currently, it allows users to see a total amount donated to the sub for that period (it will also show the portion sent to the Jar from tips, but the devs need to fix that). From now until the 15th, all proceeds donated here will go towards the Custom Snoo Contest.

In the future, the Community Jar will be used for several backend functions. We currently run several bots that are used in place of AutoModerator. These bots are more accurate and remove less posts than AutoModerator would. We also plan to use portions of future funds to host contests and other giveaways that are fun for the sub. We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts for fun things you‚Äôd like to see in the subreddit.

A few ideas we have:

* Free vbucks giveaways
* Fortnite merch contests (funkopops, nerf guns etc.)
* Scuf, Steelseries, and other hardware merch contests

Sure, the damage isn't fantastic, but it's hella accurate and it's hitscan, making it easier. Plus, it can be used at a pretty far distance. It fires relatively fast, so if you've got the high ground, you can pop off a couple headshots. 

I'll of course take a purple/gold AR over it any day, but I genuinely think the Infantry is a highly underrated weapon. It rewards skill and precise aim. I mean, 80+ headshot damage is pretty great.

What are your thoughts?",FortNiteBR

Normal solos are so boring and arena is camping in a ball all game and is only fun at the higher tiers for competive players who play 13 hours am day. In my opinion, I'm a decently mechanically skilled player. My building and aim is well above average, and yet I still die due to unwinnable situations due to no mats and health on kill to players I easily outplay in a fair fight. I'm not saying this is always the case but I'd say it is in a majority of games. I've never seen a game that they are branding as competitive require so much rng to win. Furthermore, I dont understand some peoples arguments regarding siphon. I hear people say things like,'but it gives worse players a chance against sweats'. This literally makes no sense to me. Games, shooter games especially rely on skill to win, therefore if you're better you deserve to win. If you're not prepared to work to become better at the game then you dont deserve to win. The thing that annoys me most is how little they listen to the community. Name one big person apart from tfue that complained about theses changes. I dont know any. We all loved these changes, even a majority of casuals. I find it hard to wrap my head around it.",FortNiteBR

I bought the game in beta and i have just started to play again and apparently my credit card was saved an my account wich i was unaware about.
Epic games the only company that does not have 
chat support or phone support wich is great because then they don't need to deal with this.
I cant wait for months to get my stolen money back so hopefully the police and my bank caan solve this for me.

The general strategy to do so is editing the two squares closest to yourself and rotating it twice.


What you may not know is that you can avoid having spin the piece by editing the two further quarters instead. Doing so will have your ramp facing the correct way and may help you get your edit done in the critical seconds on the starter island before the bus takes off.

This is so frustrating, they need to use the left and right arrows on the dpad (which currently do nothing) so that we can still crouch when building.

I’m going to make real points about real problems with the game that desperately need to be addressed. 

Here’s my stats, I don’t know why but it may give a perspective on the type of player I am or something: https://www.stormshield.one/pvp/stats/Accentrick

1. **Updates/Skins over Bugs**: Well, I think people are finally starting to get on board with this one. The weekly spam of weapons and new items is completely unnecessary to the game, especially when there are bugs that should be prioritized first. Perfect what you already have before you start adding to it.

2. **Weapon dilution**: The weapon pool is starting to become almost comical. The fact that I can spawn in and find 4 worthless weapons before finding an AR or shotgun is obsurd. The game was much better earlier on when you could find the guns you needed and then get on your way and hunt for kills. Not find a cross bow, hand cannon, hunting rifle and C4. Way too much bs added when the weapon classes should be very basic.

3. **Improvements**: I play on PS4 (console pleb) and there are some EXTREMELY obvious improvements that could be made but somehow are ignored. The controller scheme on console is horrid and despite the 20 posts a day about new schemes to make building more user friendly, we get nothing. No sensitivity options while in building mode either. Aim assist on some weapons is nothing but a hindrance. How do you lead your hunting rifle shot when aim assist forces the reticle on their body? Very small things that don’t get changed in 6 months annoy me. Especially when you receive no response or support, but hey atleast now we can double heavy shotgun and play on our phones.

This is getting ranty, that is all. Stay classy Reddit.",FortNiteBR

Someone managed to get into my account and purchase the Deluxe to Super Deluxe Upgrade as well as the Super Deluxe to Limited Edition upgrade, costing me $121. In the email receipt I got, the *Description* for the items I ordered had a bunch of Russian letters in them. More on that further down.


I immediately changed my Epic Games password and my PayPal password (to different (new) passwords) and submitted a support request as well as filled out that fraudulent charges/transaction form they have on their website. I requested my account be reverted to the Deluxe edition and the funds be refunded but haven't heard back.


Then I just get home from work a few minutes ago and log into my account to make sure they haven't done anything else and I see there's two new people on my friends list. They have been accepted as a friend and I do not know them. I only had 4 people on my friends list and I know them all IRL so it's not them.


I’ve been asked to remove the usernames. EG, if you want their usernames just PM me.


I have a screenshot of him playing Fortnite from my friends list. You can see the Russian letters just like in the PayPal order. It was obviously this guy and yet his account is fine and no consequences for his actions.


Reason I am posting here is because I read a lot from other people on the forum saying that they haven't heard back from Epic Games yet and I know there are Epic Games staff that are active here. I'm hoping an Epic Games team member will see this and will be able to:


**a)** Help escalate my ticket in order to resolve this and get my refund ASAP (I can provide my Case ID if necessary).


**b)** Investigate the users who added themselves to my friends list. I’ve remove their usernames but if Epic Games wants them, PM me.


**c)** Explain to me *how* this is possible. I've been gaming for many years now, having multiple accounts with multiple emails and multiple passwords across multiple platforms and something like this has **never** happened to me. One quick Google search revealed there are heaps of other people that this is happening to. What is it about Epic Games' system that makes our accounts so easily compromised? And what are their plans to remedy this?


~~**d)** Explain to me *why* someone would do this. What does purchasing the Super Deluxe and Limited Edition upgrades on **my** account do for them? Because the StW game is still on my account right? Is it simply just to troll? (Note I haven't (and won't) be logging into my StW game until this is resolved as to ensure I don't void a refund by using anything that was added to my account. But I don't know whether the 'hacker' has already used everything on my account or not).~~

EDIT: Thanks guys, I now understand why they do it. Didn’t know the other editions came with game codes that are sellable. Although wouldnt the codes have been emailed to me? Or is it managed strictly from the client?


I don't know any of the Epic Games staff Reddit usernames, otherwise I'd tag them here. Can anyone help me ensure someone from EG sees this?


Thanks in advance


**UPDATE:** Epic Games have provided me the full refund now and I’m in the process of asking them to look into the two Russian accounts that added themselves to my friends list.

Far too much damage for such an easy way to deal 130+ damage at splash. Sure it has self damage risk, but hold on.


It's primary use is to apply pressure to enemy buildings and build attempts, sure. That's good. But I see far too many people going full ham with them in close quarters. The risk vs reward of using it in close battles is kinda broken. Sure you can build to avoid it, as everyone suggests. ""Just build LOOL 4Head"", but that applies to every weapon. RPG damage goes through buildings, so inevitably you're going to get hit if you mess up just a little bit or have an open corner or not running fast enough OR predicting where he's going to shoot. 


Now, the suggestion. You fire an RPG, it doesn't instantly fire up the rocket but goes forward a bit. Maybe 1 second or 2. Then it can explode. This gives emphasis on the pressure but reduces the effectiveness of close quarters. It can still be used while pushing, but not to 1 shot people with little to no effort.

If a player sits in the same spot for 1 minute or more then they would be stuck in place for 15 seconds and if some1 tried to camp in a spot they’d have to move around to counter it but they would make noise so every1 else could hear them moving

(300+ hour player with 10% solo win rate),"I love this game, but shotguns + building are starting to ruin the game. It seems like every game I play now is the same. People rushing up with ramps so that they can pump. Sometimes I win the pump fight, sometimes he does. It's honestly no skill. You trade shotgun shots and one of you gets lucky. Building needs a few tweaks so that there's more viable strategies. You should be able to fire through ramps (not walls) for reduced (33%) damage for one, to penalize direct rushes and give the defender an advantage. Either that, or make them have half their current hp. This would allow holding ground with another weapon to be a viable option. People should not be allowed to easily force shotgun engagements at any time. I'm getting tired of ""build wars"" where we spam wood till the sky trading pump shots. The reason why this is such a prevalent thing is that ramps block all damage and the burst damage of shotguns allow you to deal 200+ damage in one click. These two elements combined make shotgun rushing the dominant strategy. Epic, think about adding more balance points to weapons to deepen the gameplay, like penetration. If guns like the deagle/revolver/sniper penetrated in progress buildings for reduced damage, and shotguns/smgs didn't, we would have more choices in both builds and engagements. People wouldn't be so quick to rush everything they see. And we would have more interesting high level fights than forced short range trades all the time.",FortNiteBR

Before it's too late, I plead to epic: Please don't use the same system that they're using...","With the recent implementation of weapon skins to the PUBG test servers, Fortnite will likely release a similar feature in the near future. And while I think that weapon skins for Fortnite would be a good addition, the main concern I have is the huge gambling-lite aspect of unboxing weapon skins in games like CS:GO and now PUBG. 

-

My suggestion: If they decide to add loot boxes, they should make it so that you can't get duplicates of skins that you already own. You still have the mystery aspect that some people like, and you have a fair shot at getting the coolest skins, but you're guaranteed to receive every skin in the crate if you buy as many crates as there are available items in the crate. 

-

The best example I know of is Brawlhalla. They have skin crates, but you can only get one of each skin. That means that no-one can go spending the equivalent of their house mortgage (dakotaz pls stop ur gonna die) or their parents' salary on pretty virtual items. 

-

It would be seen as a good-guy move, and likely gain more traction over PUBG's vanilla implementation of a system that encourages mindless money-spending without a guaranteed prize in return.

I put in my ticket long before it came back to the shop, did I get a refund? Nope. Did I even get an answer from them? Nope.

I've posted on Reddit about it being broken several times, I've sent a PM to one of the more active EPIC devs here on Reddit. But nothing, total radio silence, but hey everytime someone posts about not getting a refund on Reddit, they instantly get it so I thought why not give it a shot.

I've tried being patient and just wait for them to answer but enough is enough, I don't even want to think about the people who don't use Reddit who has opened a ticket requesting a refund..

Although this turned out to be a small rant I'm actually just upset that I spend money on this game to support it, both STW and BR, and then I just ask for one small thing, for them to return something I bought that is broken in-game so that I can buy another skin that I really wanted that I can now never get, I didn't even want my money back..

Almost every fight I get into (besides building fights and long range shootouts), the opponent starts building stairs towards me. If I shoot the stairs, they either shoot me or drop down and build more stairs at me. If I run away, they shoot me. If I build a wall, they build over it and easily kill me with the height advantage. If I run backwards while building a wall, they build fast enough to get height advantage. If I box myself in, they wait until we're both dead to the storm.

Literally the only way to counter someone who builds stairs towards you is to build stairs towards them, and if they have height advantage you've already lost. It's the greasiest tactic in the game IMO (far worse than double pump), and basically everyone uses it at this point.

""But ur bad"" yeah I am pretty bad at this game, but that doesn't mean that stair building isn't unhealthy for this game. It turns every fight into a shotgun battle, and anybody who has a decent amount of materials doesn't need any long range guns whatsoever. Stairs instantly give you a shield from damage while also allowing you to move up and forward, they have the same cost and almost the same health as a wall. They're the ultimate offensive tool, and the variety of weapons and strategies offered in this game don't matter anymore when the optimal tactic by far is to have alot of wood and two shotguns.

Is there no way to counter stair building or am I just missing something?",FortNiteBR

198,rapkat55,1522202435,87o8cm,23,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/87o8cm/about_the_new_additions/,4,About the new additions,"4 weeks now and no news on the jetpack, it’s safe to say it’s been put on hold or canceled. Most of us want the jetpack. Atleast give it a fair chance, if it’s not too powerful then it can stay, if not then it gets vaulted and both the community/devs learn from it and can move forward. 

Epic if you’re reading this, sometimes the community doesn’t know what they want, they ask for a jetpack and then when you deliver, theres always gonna be a small minority that is skeptical but that isn’t justification to cut content everyone else wants. Come on my dudes. 

I appreciate all the other additions since it was canceled but honestly:

- Deagle is unreliable due to fire rate and probably the worst first shot spread in the game. You’ll be close range and you still miss shots that are clearly on the center crosshairs. Just an extension of the revolver 

- Crossbow is useless, it’s a niche weapon that almost no one uses. It’s ok but why use it when people just build the second they get hit, and crossbow does no building damage. AR and Shotgun meta is most prevalent, give us something worthy to offset that. 

- Heavy shotgun is just a tac with more range, people just ramp rush regardless so a pump/ tac will still outclass a heavy shotgun user. It’s just an extension of the current shotgun meta. 

- Impulses were great, they allow us to be creative with our plays and switch up meta. More items like this should be implemented. 

- Hunting rifle is a great skill weapon and a perfect answer for the bolt action spam, good job epic !

- C4 is ehh, it’s useful but nothing spectacular. Its great for toppling towers but by the time you ramp rush or sneak up on someone they’ll jump off an build again. Overall it’s a great addition that’s different but compared to what we used to get, It’s just an extension of the many explosives we have

And now I feel like guided missiles are just more of the same. RPGs were already god tier close quarters in the right hands so now you made them good for all ranges...  just an extension of the current rpg. I honestly don’t understand the direction you guys are going for now. 

As of now the new item meta has stagnated because you’ve been playing it safe these past few weeks and that’s not what you guys were about. We need new tools and mechanics not *“currently existing item but purple/gold rarity”* that stuff is fine but 3 times in a row with no word on the jetpack is worrying. 

Give us the shit that makes us change how we play. And In the future, Please give new additions a fair chance before nuking them. ",FortNiteBR

Each swing should give the same wood as it does now, but **the last swing** on each tree (the one that brings the tree down) gives **double** wood.



###### How is this risk rewarding exactly?  
Each time you bring a tree down you potentially alert a nearby enemy of your presence.   
**The bigger the tree, the bigger the risk and also the bigger the reward**, since bigger trees give higher wood per swing and thus the swing that will be doubled will give a larger bonus compared to smaller trees. On the other side, the smaller the tree, the smaller the risk, the smaller the reward for the same reasons.  



*This idea also has a side effect:*  
Since only the last swing will get doubled, it will be beneficial for you to get the tree to 100 HP and then do double damage by hitting the ''circle'' that appears when you hit objects with your pickaxe.   
The workaround for this side effect (in case it's undesirable) would be to give a **fixed** amount of extra wood with the last swing (depending on the size of the tree), instead of doubling the amount of the actual swing.",FortNiteBR

When GTA dropped, it was just the basic weapons, cars, planes and so on and on. Now it’s a dead game and it’s full of the most random things like flying vehicles etc. 
Now I love fortnite. It’s my go to game after siege and it’s always fun with friends but I’m starting to feel like the weapon ideas are abit weird. When the game started we had basic weapons with the scar as the “best of em all”. Now we have impulses and C4s which is ok I guess. They are fun and make the game unique in its own way but for example a tracking rocket ? I mean I don’t wanna make assumptions cuz I haven’t actually played with it yet but it does sound abit stupid. This sub alone already complains about regular rockets. 
Now you may think “omg that’s just one thing” but even the jet pack that was gonna come out earlier. I know it’s been scrapped or postponed and I haven’t played with it but it does sound abit far fetched. Again I don’t wanna assume but jet packs are technically for flying in the air and that’s why I’m saying it’s abit far fetched. What’s gonna come next ? Drones? Will we be throwing hammers at people?

YES, it would be ideal if they werent taking credit for it. But that's on the community to call them out for it. Obscuring your art isnt the right move. 

If you see stolen work, call it out, post it here. Post it everywhere. Tell the content creator and let THEM take action. 

But you're honestly ruining the experience by being hyper focused on it. Relax. Enjoy. And take action when necessary. But posting your name on top of the whole thing is just silly. 

I say that as a content creator.

1)larger maps

2) a game mode where rather than a bus, you are randomly spawned on the map. Preventing the mass of people going to one spot

3)take inspiration from the movie this game draws it's name from.

With the recent games blow in the past month - six weeks where it's became massive, I worry that EPIC are just going to focus on cosmetics and forget about the game itself. 

- the double pump is gone, I never used it personally, but now there is some form of delay when swapping to any shotgun that you don't seem to have on any other weapon. 

- the shotgun damage is completely random. It should only deal the small damage at a distance or if the opponent is on the side of the spread. When you do it stood 3ft away from them, it's infuriating. 

- the console lag, it's basically unbearable. If you get into a fight with more than 2 people now the game doesn't know how to handle it. Let's not even go into trying to land at titled towers, lord above, it all but crash's the game. 

- weapon bloom and RNG has become a joke. There are times, where I'm knelt down, both myself and the enemy are stood still, the bullet will still miss 4/5 times. I understand a gun can't have the damage of a rocket launcher, with the precision of a sniper and the fire rate of a minigun. But at least make the likes of the ARs remotely accurate. 

- although small, please, for the love of God fix whatever is up with bushes and trees appearing out of nowhere. 

- creates STILL appear unopened from a render distance. 

- there has been no update on the second weapon's test. That's just died and never been addressed.

I guarantee if you're a really good controller player and get a few wins a day with a controller you will not get as many wins on the first week using m+KB. The aim assist of a controller helps so much more than a keyboard when you can barely line up your shot because of mouse acceleration and low fps. Not to mention the no cursor bug.

Edit: there are pros and cons to both. Damn near the only pro to m+KB is the building advantage it provides. Almost all shooting goes to the controller as aim assist is much preferred to low fps+mouse acceleration with no aim assist that the mouse provides.",FortNiteBR

Has anyone heard any news about if they are going to fix the shotgun damage problem? I was at 10 health today and saw a guy run into a bush. I crept up behind him and was like a foot away aimed at his head with a green tactical shotgun pulled the trigger and did like 7 damage. He jumped and turned and killed me with a silenced pistol. 
Look I didn’t expect to live through the fight with 10 hp. That’s not the point I’m fine with my death as the previous fight was epic. My problem is with the inconsistency with a shotgun. Does it shoot far? Depends... does it do damage from distance? Depends... does it do heavy damage up close? Depends... So my questions are 
1. Is there damage drop off in the game?
2. Is damage RNG as well?
3. How can I get huge damage from a mile away with a shotgun yet not even get 10 damage from a point blank headshot?
4. Has epic said anything to address this issue?",FortNiteBR

I thought about what possible new maps you could add to BR in the future and I thought about a Volcano map, scattered with POI (Points of Interest), but since it’s a volcano, players will have to build a little more to escape the storm, this could introduce new building strategies. I also kinda thought that it would be cool to introduce new weapons that can’t be found on the normal map, of course these weapons would replace some maybe less used weapons like the crossbow or revolver, stuff like a poison crossbow that does damage over time or a flame thrower that does damage to buildings and heavy damage way up close to other players. Stuff like that. NOTE: These new weapons would not appear in the current map, only on the volcano. I also thought of a few locations, Laborious Laboratory, Sapphire Skyscrapers, Barbarian Beach, Mopey Mine, etc. thanks for reading, I hope u think about it. Love your game.

I can only think of 3 reasons why I’ve never seen it in Fortnite... 

1. The report system doesn’t work &amp; is just there as a placebo to help victims feel better...
2. The people I’ve been reporting don’t play very often so don’t receive enough reports to set off any red flags on epics end
3. My reasons for reporting are not good enough...

Staying on topic of that last reason... I’ve been verbally  abused over voice chat &amp; been called many racial slurs (this is kind of normal for me now, sad but true), I’ve had someone follow me around shooting everything I try to farm like trees etc to make sure I don’t get any materials &amp; lose, I’ve had someone tell me to follow them up a giant ramp because they “have a launch pad” only to find out all they had was an impulse grenade &amp; killed me, I’ve had someone follow me &amp; edit all my buildings to make me fall, I’ve also had someone destroy any building I’ve made, I’ve had someone follow me and shoot their gun every 2 seconds to make sure people know where we are.... 

there are more instances but you get my point... there are A LOT of toxic players out there, and as someone who finds solos boring &amp; who only likes to play squads, it is a shame that these people can do all of this &amp; not even worry because they know nothing will happen to them or their account so they can be as toxic as they like.",FortNiteBR

I have once seen that you can make about 1500-2500 USD from 1M views. Would this mean that these guys make about:
2k - daily = 61.4k monthly = 736.8k a year
8k - daily = 245.6k monthly = 2.95M a year

And they only have to copy paste other ppls video's?! That is like 2h a day work max...

They're actually a currency you earn in the PVE version of the game.

Buying STW is already the best cost-effective method of buying V-Bucks, even if there is a bit of grind required to earn them, there's a lot to be acquired through missions, daily quests, login rewards etc. 

If skins required less V-Bucks to purchase, perhaps more people would buy them initially but after a while people would realise that purchasing STW and just grinding a bit would be better in the long run and this would reduce income once the word gets out. This is why skins cost so much, don't expect anything to change until STW becomes free to play.",FortNiteBR

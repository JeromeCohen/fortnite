the fact that it still exists today actually boggles my mind. It's quite literally RNG, and bloom, combined with spam meta, makes for a increasingly smaller skill gap

I think they should add recoil patterns players can learn (like in CS:GO, but i think it doesn't need to be as difficult as they are in CS:GO), and make aiming more skill based and less RNG

I don't think that hip firing should be accurate, but i shouldn't have to rely on RNGesus to hit shots, looking at you AR's.

Where I live, there’s not a lot of talent to really play around. I’ve been trying for the past few days to expand but looking groups on Xbox one rarely bring any help. 

I’m sitting at 333 wins right now but those are almost all equally divided across all 3 modes. 

I can snipe, I can use explosives, I can flank, I’m patient, I can rush, I can build, I can use traps (when they’re working).

I can do everything at this game. I used to love solos but with the meta change it brought on a lot of 3rd partying and I’m just not with that. It’s not fun to me, and although I understand it’s part of the game, I hate how easy it is for someone to do it.

I love this mode. It takes on a completely different style of gameplay but there are a large amount of players that just don't get it. I drop to one of my favorite sniper perches looking over a POI. Maybe take out 1 or 2 other players looting but then I always see the same insanity. Two players trying to ramp rush each other and have a close combat fight with sniper rifles. It always ends in one of the following ways. A kangaroo jumping match til one player dies to fall damage, one player gets a lucky shot in or the pickaxes come out and its a swingfest til the player with the lowest HP loses. If you don't want a long range stealth sniper battle don't play this mode. There are other modes to play if you prefer the close quarters stuff. The kangarooing at close range in a sniper mode is ridiculous. So here are my tips for a great experience playing sniper shootout.  

Land alone. Stay away from populated areas.  

Be aware of your surroundings from all angles.  

Listen carefully for distant gunfire.  

If you spot another player who is very close to you, move away from them to get a shot. Do not run towards them.  

Take your time to line up your shot. A missed shot alerts the other player of your position.  

I'm prepared for the downvotes and comments arguing people can play however they want but it's a sniper mode for a reason. This mode is about slowing things down and getting that perfect unexpected shot on your opponent.

(Read further for more info),"You have watched some fortnite on YT and decide to try it yourself for the first time. It seems fun, you drop at lucky landings, explore all the cool weapons, you get top 50 and think you are pretty good (nobody except for you landef on lucky landings). But then you just get rushes by a super pro player who builds like in seconds, before you could blink a second and you already died. You tend to think this game is just stupid and never play the game anymore.

This is a problem a lot of us A LOT OF US are suffering to, it takes time to get better at the game, and you should do so gradually while having fun at the same time.

My suggestion is that there are ranks. Maybe like 10 ranks, and the higher your rank the more prizes you get at the end of each season. Think about dances, skins, maybe even your nametag being different. You guys know what to think for this stuff. 
By having prizes by ranking up not a lot of people will drop ranks on purpose just so they can easy win, making other people’s game exp bad

You rank up by winning or killing a lot of players or being top 10 or smthng. And you can drop ranks for example being &gt;75(when you die) maybe even when you get killed while having better loot than your opponent.

When you go squad or duo’s I think the ranks should be added up to each other and then have squads/duos with almost even ranks. Or maybe we could experimentate with solo first, and later on we could maybe use this rank system also for duos and squads.

By indulging this system fortnite will stay fun for everyone, and be still competitive. For pro-players it’ll become also an even more challenging game.
We could also do two different kind of solo modes, one solo mode where you are playing ranked, and one solo mode where you are not playing ranked, but still match up with people of same rank lvl.

Thank you for reading, and have an great day. Please fortnite do smthng about this bcz it can be really frustrating to lose to a crazy building pro.",FortNiteBR

1. They were better at building
2. If there opponent couldn’t build

Now imagine an EMP grenade that disables a persons ability to build until he’s out of combat. What a strategy shift that would be. Now I would suggest a person loses the ability to build just like his opponent when the grenade is thrown. Two shockwaves rendering the battle field build less.....high risk, high reward seems like it could be fun or frustrating.

The game brings something out of you, that other games dont. Some of it is the battle royale, but some of it is the diversity.

Battle Royale as a whole slows down gameplay. Instead of hours of games like cod or Battlefield, it comes down to moments. Whipped out that shotty, got the head shot. Sniper shot. Whatever. Then, add building into that, and you have this whole other element that changes the game.

Im preaching to the choir I know, but I love how conversations with Fortnite players are so normal, and PUBG players tend to be so hostile. It speaks volumes about the base, the game.

*It would encourage players to go to more isolated places, leading to a more balanced map distribution and more varied matches
* It would finally give something to show for not finding anyone for 10 mins every other game 
*If capped at 50, it wouldn't lead to pro players to exploiting it as getting 50 extra health won't out value the mats and gear from getting a ten kill game
*It would make it so that only guns like the 50. cal would one shot a noob
*It would lead to higher skilled games as noobs would rather keep generating amour than engage from to far away
*It would both buff the 1 by 1 base experience and liven it up as it would both give people a reason to hide in it and a reason rush 1 by 1 bases. People would do this instead of hiding until they are forced out by the storm then get shot immediately by someone camping them
*Amour would take damage at the same rate as health to keep things simple 
*It wouldn't nerf high skilled players 50 health doesn't immediately make them lose
*If you wanted to buff low skilled players even more you could make it so getting downed would replenish your armour 
*This would help everyone as it would prevent people finishing people off slightly without punishing anyone 
*It would also help recently revived players have a chance at killing people because they would have 80 health instead of 30
*Oh and it would act like shields in that it would not affect the storm, fall damage, or stink bombs. And it would take damage before shields

I’m back again with another update on SCOUT, our free Fortnite Teammate Finding App!

&amp;nbsp;

First and foremost, the community on this subreddit was so positive, helpful, and supportive the last time we posted. So, from everyone who has worked on and contributed to SCOUT, we’re extremely thankful for your support - it means a lot to see we weren’t the only ones having trouble finding better teammates. We’re glad to hear you’re finding great teammates successfully!

&amp;nbsp;

If this is your first time hearing about it, we built SCOUT because we thought finding great teammates for Fortnite was way too tedious and difficult. SCOUT was created to find you your ideal Fortnite teammate by matching players not only based on skill, but on personality as well, and all with only a simple click of a button. We posted initially here one month ago when we launched: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vdfnw/we_built_scout_over_the_past_few_months_a/

&amp;nbsp;

Since our beta launch on Google Playstore and Apple’s TestFlight, we’ve gotten a ton of positive feedback and learned so much from players looking for their ideal teammate. We have a growing and active Discord community where we receive feedback and where passionate players vote on product changes. We’ve taken in all this information and have launched the second major update to SCOUT yesterday.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ve created a blog post with all of the learnings, a snazzy infographic, player shoutouts, and patch notes here: https://medium.com/@joinscoutgg/dd59460459db. We can’t wait for players to see and show off their new profiles (showing in-game stats along with ranked badges from the ratings other players give them).

&amp;nbsp;

We can’t wait for you to see the changes to the App, and if you haven’t used it yet, we can’t wait to hear what you think about it! 

&amp;nbsp;

If you want to try it out for yourself, the queue to find teammates is open daily from 6:00PM - 12:00AM ET, and it’s completely free to use.

&amp;nbsp;

**This link: https://joinscout.app.link/CosweMEcNO will take you to Google Playstore (if clicking on Android), our TestFlight sign-up app (if clicking on Apple), or our website (if clicking on PC).**

&amp;nbsp;

Let me know if you have any questions about SCOUT or feedback on the App in the comments here, I try to respond to every comment, and the comments in the last post were great. 

&amp;nbsp;

Again, huge thanks to all of you for helping us build this incredible community and letting us be a part of yours. 

&amp;nbsp;

Here’s a Gyfcat showing a few new features in action: https://giant.gfycat.com/OrdinaryCorruptHerring.webm

I am not complaining but instead throwing out options that could maybe solve the issue. Pump shotgun was never in worse form than he is now, the slow animation and low damage are not attracting players to pick it up regularly but most of us still pick it up because other shotguns are not that great either. The following points are my go to updates that could work.

1. Make all shotguns do base damage (lets say 20 damage) + amount of pellets that hit the target  ( this will stop the 8 damage thing going on )
2. (or) Remove the Pump Shotgun long pulling out animation because it's really not needed after you've added the delay between equipping shotguns and other weapons. 
3. (or) Bring back the double pump ( double shotgun in general ) this is something 90% of players love and it really won't be OP like before because pumps can not one shot anymore and they are really slow when equipping. One of these updates should be applied because this isn't working well

One more issue that good players experience is the delay i have mentioned earlier between shotguns and other weapons ( **also buildings)** , why does that matter? If you are fast editor and builder, you can not build, switch to shotgun and shoot and then do this in loop. The delay will stop you from shooting a quick shot after you have replaced their wall with your own.

I would love the idea to try out a squads/duos game mode where thirsting was not an option when you get downed or down an opponent. 

Being thirsted is one of the worst feelings in the game and often times if one person is thirsted at the beginning of the game, the rest of that persons team will just back out and que up for a new game. 

I think this is part of what leads to a slow mid game, in squads/duos.

I would say I’m addicted. I don’t know why but something about this game makes me want to play even though I know the dev team has made it terrible. This is not only gonna talk about how Epic has ruined Fortnite but also how they don’t seem to understand basic consequences to their own decisions.

I’ll start with the Spray and Pray meta because that’s the easiest thing for people to get behind me on. Making SMGs viable is not inherently a bad thing, even though they take much less skill than shotguns and do require some luck with bloom. My problem was Epic nerfing building and shotguns along with the SMG buffs and new additions. It has made this game less about building to the high ground to shotgun your opponent to shooting down whatever he builds and hope that you still have ammo in your clip and have lucky spread in order to kill him. Fortnite is already a game that is very luck based with loot you get and now Epic seems to want basic gunfights to be luck based.

Now I’ll talk about the jet pack. This was originally gonna be released before the hunting rifle but the community hated the idea because jet packs have ruined basically every shooter game they have been implemented in. So Epic did not release it... until (well I’m not too sure when it was released.) I don’t have a problem with fly explosives and close encounters because they are LTMs and I don’t need to play them. Epic released the jet pack knowing that they would take it out. So my question is WHY WOULD THEY EVEN RELEASE IT IF NOBODY LIKED THE IDEA OF IT AND THEY KNEW THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO TAKE IT OUT BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS CREATED BY IT? I believe it was either Hamlinz or Sypher who said “this is the worst time to play Fortnite” while this item was in the game. And Epic didn’t take it out sooner even though nobody that knew how to build well enjoyed this item.

Now I’ll talk about the removal of double shotgun. First of all I do not believe that this change was necessary at all, but I’m not gonna talk about my opinion because many people feel the same and it would be redundant to say what everyone already knows. I’m talking about the post they said before removing it they said that they believed the game thrived because of its multiple playstyles (which it didn’t and still doesn’t, it thrives because of the reward for winning because it’s difficult for many people) but regardless of the fact that they said that they wanted many playstyles, they went and removed: double pump, pump tac, heavy pump, double heavy, and heavy tac. My problem is that they (as stated in paragraph 1) don’t understand the impact of their changes.

Now for playground; the idea of people making their own servers with four instead of 100 players should have made epic think that they needed more servers. They instead released it without any countermeasures and it backfired. Then we waited another week, but then epic had the audacity to release a tweet explaining the problems that occurred while releasing playground. It shocked me that nobody on epics part even thought that there would be a problem with creating 15x the amount of servers. They had no idea that this would screw up their game, that is the problem I have with it. Then they didn’t add aim assist on console making it virtually impossible to practice and duel (you know, the main reason most people were excited for)

Now for the guided missile. I don’t know how it ever made it into the game in its original state. A weapon that makes you camp and kill enemies with virtually 0 risk to yourself. Does that sound like it fits in the game? No! Now it did have one unique thing to do and that was self rocket riding. They vaulted the weapon which I didn’t care for, but then they re-released it and basically removed self rocket riding (at least on console) with the turn control being limited. This is not a “scouting tool” because you can’t even scout that well with it because of its short timer.  They removed the one interesting stat on a completely bland weapon.

I could go into more detail but my hands are getting tired, I just hope people see the incompetence of this company and make their opinions heard.",FortNiteBR

While searching the Fortnite section on twitch I came across a guy with 700 viewers ([https://www.twitch.tv/a\_for\_amazin](https://www.twitch.tv/a_for_amazin)) First thing I notice is he has 0 people talking in chat except for one guy named ""bud320"". After awhile I started to notice that this bud account is just the streamer on a alt account typing in his own chat to make it look some what active.

You can even see him typing on his cam then you'll see the bud320's message come up in chat. I called him out for it and he first denied it than tried to say ""It's my cousin, hes sitting beside me in our gaming house"" How stupid can he be lmao you can clearly see him on webcam typing.

So then I ask why his chat is so dead for 700 viewers and about 1 min after he reads it his views start to drop. First it dropped down to 500 views than within 10 mins he goes down to 100 viewers. This is where he started to get really toxic telling me to ""get bullied"" [https://imgur.com/a/ilePqDN](https://imgur.com/a/ilePqDN) &amp; [https://imgur.com/a/y0bFsZM](https://imgur.com/a/y0bFsZM)

Again Im not usually the one to make threads like this but something needs to be done with this guy as there is legit streamers grinding to try and get even 10 viewers while this guys out here viewbotting 700 viewers..

The 5 second reload feels way longer compared to the reload on a bolt. I’m not calling for this gun to be buffed or nerfed, although it makes sense for a double sniper nerf.

- It used to be funny af watching defaults playing in squads or solos running like no care in the world and doing funny things.

- Now you shoot at a default and they build a fucking fort with wifi.

- So now we kill every deafult we see by pushing like we push regular players.

This would be good, even if it was just pump to something rather than with everything, or double barrel to something.

With the jetpack vaulted, if close encounters were to make a return it possibly wouldn't include the jetpack. But I think with the physics in Soaring 50s, it could be a really good game mode, possibly better than the old CE.

So is it coming back in v5.30? SMG lovers probably think not but after their big nerf there isn't all that much variety in close range now. Double shotgun should probably come back to bring the variety back.

Being a shotgun lover even I think double shotgun got out of control, but removing it completely was not the solution. As I mentioned earlier, maybe have no swap timer after firing the pump or the double barrel?

I've been in some situations where one team has 20+ people alive, and we're wasting time just trying to find one person. Not to make assumptions but I think it's a pretty good bet that one person won't turn the game around, however I wouldn't say that they should just leave the game. ",FortNiteBR

It would be great to get at least a discussion in here every once in a while. This game mode is tons of fun to breeze into and enjoy big firefights!

**Please remember that these are all just my opinion.**

# Praise

+ Thanks for keeping a large-scale team-based mode like 50v50 in the game for months and months! Every large-scale team mode has been a blast. 50v50 personally feels real casual compared to 5 Teams of 20 (5TO20), but both are fantastic.
+ There is always enough shields! It still surprises me when I loot a chest and I get 2 big shield potions at once, or 6 minis. Sometimes I get bad luck, but it's great to *consistently* get some shields at the start. Less stress at the beginning and I can immediately get to farming materials.
+ Players are more friendly than people give them credit for. I see people dropping Shields and Medkits for newly-revived players often. Multiple times I have revived someone and they end up picking me back up later. Even no-skins revive me if the coast is clear. Sometimes they even revive me in the middle of a firefight and we *both* die! *Real champions!*
+ Tilted Towers really shines in this game-mode when it is in the storm circle. I have seen losing games turn completely around in that city multiple times, and vice versa. It is almost always a good fight in Tilted.
+ This is absolutely the best way to get better at the game. Playground is a great way to improve with friends if you're all around the same skill level. 50v50 is the roulette experience. You never know who you're going to be fighting next. It's a great way to test your own skill when there are shots being fired in all directions. It really heightens your spacial awareness for the other game modes.
+ Using emotes with strangers is a great way to get across very specific feelings of what you just went through together. If two people are in the backseat of an ATK and you don't have Infinite Dab, *what the heck are you playing this game for?*

# Tips

+ **Grenades.** Just the plain ol' gray grenades. Gather them up as a third or fourth slot. People seriously underestimate them and it's a simple way to get people out of good spots. Never throw just one. The grenade launcher really already plays a good role in wiping out people, but you're much more likely to find simple grenades. Just keep throwing them!
+ Farm in the first 3 to 4 minutes. You get more materials in 50v50 mode, so you have more options. Wood for mobility. Brick for build fights. Metal for forts. Easy.
+ Revive at least one dude. You get XP for it anyway. If you've got extra minis, give two of them to the person you saved. They could save you later.
+ Before putting down a Launch Pad, make sure it's somewhere where other teammates can clearly see it and easily use it. This is more important if you're trying to outrun the storm. Don't put it on top of a flat building. Build it higher so that we can see it and outrun the storm with you.
+ If the storm circle is even just a tad in Tilted Towers at all, you should drop there ASAP. This usually applies also to the general Tilted/LootLake/PleasantPark area of the map. Take a chance and do your best.
+ If you're reviving someone- or someone is reviving others- and you're in decent cover, put a roof over the cover. You never know who's gonna show up. A roof is all it takes!
+ Scoped Assault Rifles are awesome. Great way to pick off people at any skill level. Thermal ARs are great at finding the last remaining enemies too.
+ Put spike traps in the most innane spots when in a highly fought-over area. You can catch multiple people off-guard.
+ If the last enemies are hiding, check around the outer edges of the storm circle on all sides. People are always hiding there. Or, *y'know*, **sometimes** they'll be in a bush right next to you ... at the very center of the storm ... where you already killed five people in a firefight ... and 20 of your teammates can't find this bush just *hanging out.* This has happened only **once.**
+ **You will only get the EXP for a 50v50 match when one team wins or loses. If you die and leave, you will not get EXP.** Apparently multiple people I've played with didn't know about this, so it's going here in bold.

# Critique (Suggestions, really)

+ The current scenario where you find out where the storm circle is when both buses cross is completely fine and does not need to be changed. On that note ...
   + I really hope the big storm circle comes back. In 50v50 V3, for a short period, the storm would circle around a large area of the map, then shrink to what we know now. Having everybody on the map being in one storm circle apparently created lag problems, so they cut it. This large circle was great! It really encouraged people to focus on being in a couple distinct locations before seeing the final circle and everybody coming from different directions to that one spot. Some games involve a lot of the team sometimes going wherever the wind blows, and we lose because teammates are scattered all over the map by themselves. A large storm circle would at least give people a little incentive to get moving early. *Maybe.*
+ Paradise Palms is a great psuedo-Tilted. Great spot on the map, but unfortunately I have only had **one** storm circle end up there in all of my games! Do some tuning to have more fights happen there, please.
+ The material amounts you farm in 50v50 is pretty good. It should be increased just a *little bit*. When you win a fight, you will get more than enough materials for later fights though, most of the time. In 5T020, though, material amounts should be definitely be increased. This is less easy to explain and more of a gut feeling based on my own experiences.
+ Almost everybody I play with either does not use, or drops, Bandages. Medkits should be more prominent in 50v50 mode only.
+ Rifts are usually in specific locations throughout the map. It would be great if Rifts were a bit more prominent in several more locations in 50v50. Randomized. Maybe not randomized. I don't know. Just some more of them would be nice. The new Soarin' 50s gamemode is a great alternative for now!
+ Spatial audio. Sorry, but it's just not very good at all. This has less to do with 50v50 and more involving the whole game. 50v50 mode only exacerbates the problem of how much the spatial audio needs to be improved. I know this has already been mentioned in dev blog posts, so I look forward to it with patience. epic ... pls fix.

That's it! Hope any of this was interesting, helpful, or useful to read. 50v50 is a ton of fun and I hope we get to see more improvements to the mode in the future!",FortNiteBR

I've been locked out of my Epic games/Fortnite account for almost a month, when i log into my account it asks for a security code that has been sent to the email connected to my account.
It used to send fine but now it has not sent in well over a month...

I've contact epic games support and they can't help me at all and don't really seem that interested in helping me any further hence why i'm making this post to see if anyone has figured out a fix or something to get around the email issue.

It's not my email address as i have received these codes before, i've worked with my email provider to see if anything was being blocked, Nothing was.

Here's what epic games can't do to help me:
* Can't change my email address.
* Can't disable the 2 factor email security  (they told me they successfully removed the email security  at one point to later on say they can't do it)
They're just telling me ""Our team is doing investigations on this issue and we will contact you with updates. ""


so i searched up this issue and so happens it's been a thing since email authentication has been a thing, there are players who have been locked out of their account for months &amp; months and still we all get the same response that they're investigating but there has been nothing to show for it.

so me and a bunch of other players who have paid for cosmetics, the battle pass and so forth are now locked out of their account for enabling extra security to make sure nobody else could get into their account.

So if anyone has a workaround or thinks they know of something that could help, feel free to throw them my way because i just want to find a way back into my account since i've missed most game modes &amp; birthday celebration stuff because of this.

Thanks.

I believe that the damage SMGs do to buildings should be heavily reduced as it allows people to build battle without having to worry if you are going to be knocked down by a rally of SMG bullets.  I think that the damage SMGs do to players is fine and should only be reduced slightly.
2. I think double pump should be brought back to an extent as it was useful to people who missed there first shot, allowing them to have another chance rather than having to wait a while before there next shot is ready. If you believe that they should be punished. The opponent will also be able to shoot them easily if they have 2 pump shotguns. I think it should also be implemented as pump shotguns no longer do over 200 damage with one shot, also now that you can sometimes do 7-8 damage with a shotgun, it means that you have a better chance of doing more damage.

Please comment on my thoughts.

Sincerely,

2. I think heavy is in a perfect place right now where it has solid use and shouldn't be nerfed, I think pump should be buffed

Recently I got back to Fortnite after finishing my finals and I noticed a sudden increase in eliminating knocked players. What's up with that?

Now, eliminating your opponent (when knocked) has always been there. However, compared to previous seasons I'm baffled by how many times I and my teammates have been eliminated. Is there a patch note I've missed? Is there increased exp for eliminating your opponent?

I've even had this occasion where I was playing with a friend of mine and he knocked one player, but he decides to let him live. Unfortunately the other guy managed to knock my friend down. As I stood there in front of this last enemy and fired shots at him, he decided to turn to my friend and finish him instead of killing me to get 2 kills instead of 1.

Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to risk your own life for 1 kill while you could have gotten 2 instead? What is there to gain?

Personally I find it very weak to kill a knocked player. He is no threat to your team besides possibly giving information on your positioning if he pushed your side. But even then, boxing him in is easily done. I also believe that it is unfair in scenarios where the enemy team clearly is going to outplay you and you eliminate one of their knocked teammates. Some might see it as a strategy to deprive their teammates should they win the fight, but I don't think you'd like to watch your team win/play the game without you for the next 15 minutes either. Also some may say it's a tactic because it's ""war"", but I personally believe it's not a legitimate tactic in war. I don't think the enemy team will ""revive"" their shot down brethren when there's still an immediate threat. Reviving takes 10 seconds. So if the enemy team manages to revive their teammate, you actually failed to apply pressure in a situation where one player was down and a second player was reviving.

Of course there's an element of hypocrisy to this topic. You might say: “People eliminate me when I'm knocked down, so I’ll do the same."" But you might forget that your frustration is towards the person that killed you prematurely in the previous game, not towards those in the next games. So by having this mentality and taking such actions you just create a vicious cycle in which everyone keeps eliminating each other when knocked down.

Now, in the end it might not be a recent trend. However, after taking a break this all caught my eye. Personally I believe something should be done about this. Maybe something such as making knocked players immune to enemy damage but increase DMG/s lost when knocked down. Perhaps being immune to damage for 5-10s and/or reduced weapon damage (pickaxe excluded) might do the trick as well. I don't know, these are just some ideas.

What are your thoughts on this all? Do you agree with eliminating knocked opponents being a thing? If not, what would you like to be changed? I would personally like to see an initiative from the community to show some good sportsmanship by keeping knocked players alive. I think it'll make the game more enjoyable for everyone. And who doesn't love to see 4 kills in a row on the kill feed? ;)

*****

**TL;DR:**

I have noticed a trend in eliminating knocked down opponents. I believe that it provides no real value mid-battle and that it only causes frustration. I also believe Epic Games should look into possible solutions to minimise this behaviour and we as a community should do something as well. How do you feel about? Do you agree or disagree?",FortNiteBR

2. The bullet can then continue on it's path to either
   1. Hit a player for %of structure damage left \* original player damage.
   2. Hit another building piece in its path and deal the remaining damage possibly continue after that provide there is still excess damage.

I think it could be an interesting counter to turtleing and keep players moving.

For an Epic/Legendary rarity item and what it was advertised as before it's initial release, this weapon seems incredibly underwhelming compared even to a Green Pump.

There are so many attributes of this weapon that leave it inferior to it's counter parts which ultimately leads to it not being a viable choice....

(Slow Reload) -&gt;  Because of its advertised ""High Burst Damage"" there is a very slow reload time that accompanies this weapon giving it a strong penalty.

(High Spread) -&gt; The major pellet spread of this weapon leads to even worse inconsistencies than the pump used to have, unless you are literally face to face trying to whisper in your opponents ear when you fire a shot you very well may only see that a few pellets actually manage to hit your target...

(Intense Damage Fall Off)-&gt;  This is another serious penalty and perhaps the worst to accompany this weapon.. with the high damage fall off added on top of the high spread you have no choice but to get face to face with your opponent if you ever hope to do any damage   - it's not uncommon to see a hit marker for 30 damage even if you are within 1 meter of your opponent.


The amount of penalty added to this gun make it so incredibly situational that there is literally NO viable reason to use an item slot in your loadout over even a Green Pump...

When it was released I honestly was hyped to try it out.. But I was immediately disappointed the moment I tested it out ... 


The penalties for its high damage are so stiff that it causes the item to become a ""1 trick pony"" that is only useful in very situational moments that may not even happen very often...


So you have an item with a ""Rare"" drop rate that is literally only useful in ""Rare"" situational moments......


Like , when I manage to find this Rare Shotgun that's supposed to be good (according to rarity) then HOPEFULLY I will stumble upon the rare occasion that I can use it to full potential without putting my self at risk to do so....




TLDR;    This gun needs a buff, or it's gonna get vaulted. It's not even KINDA good unless you are a suicidal maniac that wants to push face to face with everyone... if you are not FACE TO FACE then this gun is absolutely trash compared to even a Green Pump.",FortNiteBR

I snuck around, she was hiding behind a bunch of sideways ramps, and when the circle shifted, I ran with it towards her, ramped over her, got in two shots with the double barreled shotgun, was pulling out an AR when she strayed into the storm for a couple seconds and died. 

Ironically I was in the storm too when this all happened, but I guess my shotgun shots had lowered her to almost no health. 

I’m excited because I usually win one solo game a season (been playing since S3) and this is the second game I’ve won in less than a week.

Some songs to listen to would be:

Shiroyama - Is about the ""Battle of Shiroyama"" which took place on 24 September 1877, in Kagoshima, Japan. It was the final battle of the Satsuma Rebellion, where the heavily outnumbered samurai under Saigō Takamori made their last stand against Imperial Japanese Army troops under the command of Generals Yamagata Aritomo and Kawamura Sumiyoshi. The battle culminated in the annihilation of Saigō's army as well as his death, marking the end of the Satsuma Rebellion. The samurai numbered 500 to 30,000, and managed to kill 30 IJA troops, but all the samurai were fell.

Primo Victoria - Is about D-Day in which the Western Allies of World War II, launched the largest amphibious invasion in history when they assaulted Normandy, located on the northern coast of France, on 6 June 1944. The invaders were able to establish a beachhead as part of Operation Overlord after a successful ""D-Day,"" the first day of the invasion.

Ghost Division - Which is about the 7th Panzer Division was an armored formation of the German Army in World War II. It participated in the Battle of France, the invasion of the Soviet Union, the occupation of Vichy France, and on the Eastern Front until the end of the war. The Seventh Panzer Division was sometimes known by its nickname, Ghost Division.

Panzerkampf - Is about the Battle of Kursk which was a Second World War engagement between German and Soviet
forces on the Eastern Front near Kursk (450 kilometres or 280 miles south-west of Moscow) in the Soviet Union, during July and August of 1943.

Art Of War - The Art of War is an ancient Chinese military treatise dating from the Spring and Autumn period. The work, which is attributed to the ancient Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu (""Master Sun"", also spelled Sunzi), is composed of 13 chapters.

Compare that to most solo and 50 v 50 games I've played where within ten minutes I'd be lucky to get into 10, and thats mainly if I land at tilted. And that doesnt include how in cod and other respawn games you get a constant stream of gunfights, whereas in fortnite there are lulls throughout the game where you have do the most mundane tasks (mat farming and looking for loot). And if you do farming and looting to get some useable guns, then die right after, you literally wasted all that time. Respawn games dont have that problem.
,


Now I feel like this is a bigger problem on console than pc when it comes to practicing aim. On pc, you dont have aim assist, which means you can practice your aim by shooting teammates/inanimate objects. This applies to pubs as well as playgrounds, because on pc you can just play as teammates and practice shooting each other without worrying about having to find shield and bandages to restore health, or without having the person respawn and having to parachute and get back to his loot if you killed him.

On console, you literally have to shoot enemies to practice aim, as aiming with and without aim assist requires completely different muscle memory. In other words, you cant practice aiming while not using aim assist if you'd normally use aim assist. Its just different muscle memory. And for the people that say ""just turn off aim assist"", I would love if that was a realistic solution, but it isnt. You'd put yourself at a major disadvantage against solid players who use aim assist, as the aim assist does help alot with aim as its pretty strong in this game.

,

As for how theyd actually make a respawn mode, I dont have a clear cut solution, but I have some ideas:
- Cut off a portion of the map and only use that as the playspace
- To prevent snowballing (people who win one or two gunfights, get a bunch of good loot, and keep on killing people who just repsonded), give the people who respawn a starting weapon and a set amount of mats. 
- To expand on the previous point, you could potentially just give people preset classes starting out during the match (with different guns and potentially a different items, as well as a set amount of mats to start out with). You'd then spend the match looking for power weapons and farming as well as getting into fights
- Cap the amount of bullets someone can hold so people just dont hoard a whole lot of bullets.
- Have there be respawning loot, the locations would most likely have to shift around the map
- For a 2 team based mode, you'd need a smaller amount of people than a 50 v 50. And having people spawn on the ground in a 2 team gamemode could potentially be superior.

If they made a mode like this, it would be close to all I ever play until I got really good at the game. At the moment it just takes so much longer than respawn games to get better, due to the low amount of interactions you get per game. Playground helps with this, but its not perfect. Atm I honestly hate this game, it just feels like a waste of time, but I know it has a lot of undiscovered potential. ",FortNiteBR

[Figures](http://imgur.com/iMk8NOC)

Okay so as you can see, on July 10, interest in Fortnite peaked at 100 million searches. Now I’m not saying how many times Fortnite is searched reflects Fortnite’s relevance or anything, but just keep reading. 

Around July 10, the three spray guns that started the spray meta were introduced. 7 days after the Tommy gun was released and 7 days before the SMG got released Fortnite peaked. Then when the SMG got released more people went on. After that, the P90 released.  Then when everyone realized that spraying and praying was horrible and bad, less and less search results and people started playing less and less.

But then... 

The new shotgun came out. Everyone thought that the spray meta would end due to this. As you can see, Fortnite peaked again with 100M on August 7, the day the shotgun was released. But still, spraying existed. If you look at the big graph, you can see that from May 13 to the beginning of August, Fortnite never went under 25M. 

Then if you look at the second graph, Fortnite consistently staggered under 25M (a new low) when players realized that spraying and praying is making the game less fun.  

I noticed this myself when usually I got on Fortnite there was 15-20 people on on my friends list all the time. Now, there is only 1-5 people on at a time. Spraying ruined the game. Materials were nerfed which is literally perfect for spraying. 

The new shotgun is Epic’s poor substitute for double pumping. Fortnite has gotten less and less about skill. Shotguns are bad, materials are bad, spraying is bad. 

If Fortnite continues this pattern of self destruction, the game will become bad and irrelevant. 

Spraying is bad.

Everything in here about the shotguns is my personal view. No hate to Epic or anyone else. Just wanted to point it out.  If you read all of this, thanks.

I thought my connection was bad and waited, a few days later my girlfriend wanted to try to play fortnite and could not login.

I got kicked out of games the day I installed technitum to change my MAC address. The reason for that is that I was using the wifi where I work and it requires you to input a password every 24h, because I had used the password about 23 hours I would get kicked off the wifi in less than an hour. I did not want it to happen in game so I simply changed my MAC address so that the wifi would ask for the password and give me a new 24h.

I messaged the support multiple times and keep getting bot replies saying that I cheated, now that happens alot, cheaters get banned and there is not way around it. I'm NOT here to argue if I cheated or not (I didn't) but I know some people will comment ""You got what you deserved"" I understand, there's no way to prove I didn't.

The only other thing I could see being flagged for is using razer synapse but I only use it to bind my mouse buttons to scroll up and scroll down so that I can use them instead of having to use my mouse wheel to switch weapons. Not even macros.

Because I believe that I didn't and I truly believe that if an epic employee actually checked my account they would be able to see if I did or did not I just want one to check.

I could just make a new account to play (and I will) but I don't understand how its possible to get no replies from a multi-billion dollar company.

ANY Help is appreciated, even if you just comment that I cheated it might help my post get seen by someone helpful.

I’m making this post because my view is very different from those here. 

Background: I’ve always been good at shooters and have been competing in tournaments since halo 3. I, like many other good players, spent the first four seasons of this game using building to create angles to get shotgun kills. That was my entire strategy. Sure, I used AR’s and snipers when applicable. But 90% of my gameplay revolved around using building to create angles and then pump. 

I can’t do this anymore. My builds get deleted before I’m in a position to do damage. I’ll hit a ~160 with a pump (previously would have hit for 200+) and get sprayed down with an SMG. 

I have to constantly reposition when I’m fighting 3 or 4 people. If I’m not constantly moving and building then I’ll get swarmed, sprayed and die. I can’t simply out-aim my enemies anymore.

I don’t know about you, but trying to overcome these new mechanics and high DPS-spray guns has made me much, much better. Both in my movements, my positioning and my situational awareness. 

I no longer feel completely safe when I find good shotguns and mats. I no longer feel insulated, and its awesome. ",FortNiteBR

I’m a massive fortnite noob so I bought the tomatohead to at least make myself think I’m good. So I was hiding in a roof of the shed and suddenly there were two other people left. I started shaking and one person died. It was a 1v1. I eventually had to move to the storm and he saw me and started shooting rockets at me. He was about one tile away from me so I placed a wall and he ended up killing himself. Thanks for listening!!!,FortNiteBR

Every weapon should be balanced, every item should be important and every change needs to be fitting. That‘s what all of us want! Epic Games is one of the companies that listens to the community and they make the changes to fit out opinion so they look up those forums to check the opinion on different weapons, items or changes. And so do they on Reddit. They look up all the posts that you are writing. So if those changes are not fitting to your playstyle, you shouldn‘t directly start complaining. Try to adapt to the meta and don‘t cry about double pump. If you are asking why they changed the double pump, you can directly answer with You! You are the ones deciding on where the game is going so think twice about complaining about stuff and rather get used to that. The same thing happend to the double Pump. All people complained about Red Knight not comming back, just a small amount didn‘t want to bring the skin back in the shop. But as Epic realized the majority wants Red Knight back, they put it back into the shop. And look now, the Red Knight is in my opinion one of the most overused skins now.
TL;DR: Think twice of complaining about changes and try to adapt. If you asked how double pump got removed, you can ask yourself.
Epic listens to your opinion and changes it. Same happend to double pump.",FortNiteBR

I'm a pro player in my country, Israel, I'm considered (Now this is the point when you downvote me because you think I wanna show off, but this is IMPORTANT to the rest of it).

I didn't see a guy who doesnt know how to build a full month, I dont really care I didn't see but this is A FACT, I didn't see a whole MONTH a guy who doesnt know how to build, in my main account in solos 8-9 people in the last circle, EVERYONE is INSANE at the game (when I'm telling you that the players are insane, I have really good stats (I told you it's important), the guys from my prespetcive of a really good player, they're INSANE, if I go play scrims I dont even notice the different between the players I'm against, it's that insane)

Now, when I jump to my smurf account it's so easy it's ridiculous, I watch youtube videos and the casual games (Normal queue) is looking so easy to me, and for a whole month I thought poeple got better, but then I jump to my smurf + thinking this game is so big, there is no way I didn't meet a guy who doesnt know how to build for a full MONTH, I started realising this game is using MMR, there is almost no games existing when they just drop you into a game, especially a game like this, this game is HUGE, Epic Games need the ""noob"" players to play with the ""noobs"" players, they need the good players to play with the good players, they dont wanna make the noobs quit.

100% of the noskins are fakers with 700+ wins, this is going out of hand and it's not enjoyable to me AT ALL.

It's diffently not placebo, the difference between the accounts is so huge you can't even imagine, I can make a post with avg stats to each match compare to smurf but it's gonna take a lot of time.

Sry for bad English.

Can I somehow contact Epic about this? Thanks for all the people who actually read all of this and not go and instantly downvote that, because not all of you experiance that.",FortNiteBR

I broke down a list of some of the potential benefits this playlist could bring. Please free to provide insight on whatever pros/cons this playlist would have and whether or not you agree. Also, add any other playlist ideas you might have, I am interested in reading them!

Benefits:

\- Minimizes the chance of losing a battle due to poorly skilled teammates found through the ""fill option""

\- Minimizes the chance of losing a battle due to the inability of your teammates to each focus on an opponent. (there have been countless times where my friends and I have lost battles where we have knocked 3/4 of the opposing squad, and lose as 2 opponents can focus on a singular teammate). 

IN SUM, IT WOULD REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DYING FROM BEING OUTNUMBERED WHICH IS ANNOYING AF. ",FortNiteBR

My idea to fix this, is to add some sort of cooldown to the minigun. My idea of a cooldown being add some sort of function to where the minigun overheats after X amount of shots fired, giving the other person time to actually strategize and figure out the next move.

It's just an idea, and I think I'll have many people who agree and disagree. I'd like to hear different opinions, as maybe somebody has an alternative idea. ",FortNiteBR

To start I’m very thankful for the Build Pro controller setup on console. Once you get used to it, it’s great. 

However, there’s one small issue. On console, RB and RT (Xbox) are on the right side of the controller, yet they correspond to the left two mat formats (floor and ramp, respectively). Having these switched would help as it wouldn’t be counterintuitive for playing as pretty much every console player previously was going right for ramp and ceiling, and left for walls and floors. I think having ramp on RT, wall on LT, floor on LB and pyramid on RB would make much more sense.

Thanks.",FortNiteBR

If you want my input I would love if they implemented a live chat. I wouldn't care if it was a 27 hour queue in line for me.

It's not shocking to hear people play Fortnite more than a couple of hours without getting their 1st ever kill.  That's not a recipe for fun.

2.  Throw the current map in the vault and give us a brand new map that synergizes with all the new traversal items.  Not enough people recognize this but the current map kinda sucks.  Epic has learned a ton about Battle Royale in the past 8 months.  Time to put that knowledge to use and give us a map we deserve.

It's an article digesting something an Epic employee said about Multiplayer.  Epic found that 90% of players don't play a second match of multiplayer if they didn't record a single kill in their first match.

It's never been more difficult for new players in Fortnite than right now.  The player base, on average, is better than its ever been.

Fortnite needs to find a way to get first time players a decent chance at getting a kill or two early on in their Fortnite career.

I am a PS4 player if that makes any difference

I'd make the following changes

The main one: Shotgun damage
Shotguns should do half of the quoted value MINIMUM (within shotgun ranges), even if only one pellet hits. This will get rid of 7s and 9s we see so often whilst keeping accuracy important. 

The first circle should be entirely on land (except loot lake of course) , and the second circle should close slightly slower (15s ish). This will stop players having to play Running Simulator 2018 if we decide to land at Flush Factory for instance. I know people will say just land more centrally, but I don't think we should discourage certain POIs

Reduce RPG *player* damage to 50-75 but keep the building damage the same. This is in those CQB situations where if one player has it they have a distinct advantage. I know at medium range you can easily build to block but at close range I believe it's too powerful.

Keep first shot accuracy but if you stand up from a crouch it is disabled, therefore you can't do this peeking glitch I'm sure you're aware of.

Keep the guided missile out of the loot pool. They were fun for a bit, but now it's just boring. I just build a box, wait for the missile, move 100 yards, build another box.

Reverse the weapon switch nerf, but I could reconcile keeping it between guns of the same class

Thanks for reading, discussion welcome!! :) 

Tl;dr: Shotguns should do minimum half the quoted value, RPG player damage nerf, first circle entirely on land, fix peeking glitch, don't return the guided missile, reverse the weapon switch nerf

It looks 100% mouse because it is. AlexRamiGaming uses an adapter with his mouse and keyboard on PS4. The adapter tricks the PS4 into thinking he is using a controller. This way he can use mouse and keyboard AND HAVE AIM ASSIST ENABLED. The downside to this trick (before the 3.5 update) is you can't assign keys to building pieces (because Fortnite thinks you are using a controller layout.) Which explains Alex's slow building. HOWEVER with the new Builder Pro settings from the 3.5 update, Alex and other ""adapterds"" can bind building pieces. Let's see if Alex learns new building controls, or sticks with the same. Either way it'll be slow.

He also has said he doesn't play on PC because cheaters get unfair advantages LMAO",FortNiteBR

Llama, port-a-fort, guided missile and now weapon draw speed..

What's next? no fall dmg potion? or perhaps nerf to a build speed - because newbies don't know how to react when someone rushes them


Every damn match I encounter opponents who have no idea how to respond to rush, freezing in place, placing panic walls or just backpedaling while crouching

Is this the player base  you are trying to appeal to, Epic?

Here's my take on it:

Epic focuses too much on casual player base, soon to leave little to none driving force for players to actually get better at this game - ""why should I try to get better at building 1x1s if I can just keep port-a-fort and deploy it in fraction of a second""

the thing about casuals is that they come and go and I would argue that the most important cause of game's longevity is its hardcore player base

and whenever you are trying to appeal to everyone, you appeal to no one

Just look at OW for example.. game isn't even 2 years old and people are already tired of it, I already got tired of it.. and here is why


Whenever someone asks me which game do I prefer - Overwatch vs CS or TF2

I would pick against OW without hesitation

OW just hands everything to a player leaving no new things for people to discover.. couple hours on a hero is enough to fully get to know him

Another big thing is hundreds of balance patches often leaving cheap mechanics that take no skill for months in a game or introducing heroes/abilities too noob friendly.. often ignoring community's uproar

Most OW pro players who have played TF2 before would tell you over a beer that they are there only for the money and if TF2 had same prizes, they would gladly come back

CS/ TF2 - those games make new players work for it, full of mechanics that take months to just get a grasp of, that are  still fun after hundreds/thousands of hours. Fortnite is in the same category, i just don't know for how long..

I guess what i'm trying to say is that making game too noob friendly is what contributes to its death

and I don't see Epic slowing down anytime soon

So I think we are all aware of the current bugs/issues that the new layout comes with: 

- Selecting stairs while sprinting will make you stop sprinting. 

- Problems with the full-auto AR not firing correctly when aiming down sights while using the Builder Pro layout.

**New(?) bug/ Problem**

Yesterday i encountered another problem: 

What happened is that i tried to block some shots by placing down walls. For some reason it didn't do so and i ended up catching those bullets with my face even though i pressed circle and held down R2. 
It actually happens pretty frequently to me, also with other building pieces too. What happens there, is that when i want to select another building piece, the first button press wont't register and it wouldn't let me switch to the building piece i want, i would have to press that button another time to make it work.

Since this is quite an annoying bug and makes the gameplay feel clunky I tried to replicate this and found out that it is really easy to replicate:

**Replication on PS4**

 - Press Circle to enter build mode
 - Press or Hold R2 *immediately/ as fast as possible* after pressing circle 

Normally you should have placed a Wall, but you did not.

*The same goes with selecting/placing other building pieces:*

- Press Circle to enter build mode 
- Press L2 *immediately or as fast as possible* after pressing circle 
- Press L2 again 

Normally you should've now built a set of stairs, which is not the case If you've done the first two steps correctly/ fast enough. Instead you still have walls selected at step 2 and stairs selected at step 3. Thus you would have to add another step to actually place your set of stairs, which should already have been the case in step 3.

**Noticable things while doing these steps**

After doing those steps to replicate the bug over and over again i noticed a couple of things: 

 - if I want to place down a wall, my gun would shoot even after pressing circle. 

 - if I want to select/ place down stairs with L2 (after pressing circle)  sometimes my Screen would zoom in and out quickly  as if I was aiming down sights.

 - if i want to select a floor with R1, the game still registers it as swapping weapons as you can still see that selection slot moving to the right while the selection bar in the HUD gets smaller in order to make space dir the build-menu.

**Conclusion/ Explanation**
 
I'm pretty sure you already saw that there is some kind of pattern behind this, but before
I jump to the conclusion I'd like to explain some terms that I'll use to illustrate the problem: 

 - **Build mode**: All the things you do after pressing circle, pretty self-explanatory

 - **Combat mode**: Things you do outside of build mode, for example ads, shooting, switching weapons.

So basically after you press CIRCLE to enter **build mode** there is a *really, really* short delay where your actions are still executed in **combat mode**. 

This also goes hand in hand with an already known issue of the builder pro layout that i listed at the beginning of this post: 

 - *selecting stairs while sprinting will make you stop sprinting*

This problem can be explained with the conclusion that i just made. 
What's causing you to stop sprinting is that you've pressed L2 (which is ADS in **combat-mode**) in that specific time window where your actions are still executed in **Combat mode**. Thus you were aiming down sights for a really short amount of time which was enough to stop your character from sprinting.

Actually looking back at this, maybe this isn't just a builder pro issue. It could be possible that this problem transfers to the other Control schemes, too. 

Finally, i would really appreciate it if you upvote to get this post some attention, so the devs can see it and look into it. 
(I really don't care about internet points, but i do care about bugs getting fixed to guarantee a better experience for everyone.)

Anyways thanks for reading and I'm sorry if anything of this is hard to understand because English isn't my native language heh.

Today it got me killed for the n-th time so I figured I will watch others play the game to relax a bit but I just spotted the same thing happening to them.

The reason I am making this post is cause I feel like this isn't getting the attention it deserves and by proving it is also happening to people who have better than average pc's maybe it could kickstart something so that the developers will take a look.

In this clip you have Tsm_Daequan building a base and the stutter causes him to miss place his stairs. (the clip has something else happen to him as well which he found bad but it is not the reason why I am posting this clip)

At the 6 seconds mark you can see it happen, with his fps dropping to a low number but due to his advertisement it's difficult to make out the number.

In this clip Dr_Disrespect is in a fight when the stutter occurs at the 7 seconds mark.

I play sometimes alone, but mostly with my friends and my brother. I know that he loves a few skins a lot in this game, but he doesn't want to spend money on them since some of the skins are pretty expensive (but that's not the main point). So about a month ago I thought I would buy some V-Bucks for his birthday, he was in the camp at this time. I went to the payment section and in my country there are only two ways to purchase V-Bucks, PayPal and by credit card. Usually I purchase things by PayPal so nothing new here. Whenever I tried adding my PayPal or Credit Card to my Epic Games account through the game AND website I got a message saying ""Sorry, create payment method failed. Please contact customer service."" I've contacted support about three weeks ago and they responded only once when they asked me what is my display name, credit card holder etc. I've also looked up at the Epic Games forums about this problem, so many people has this problem and still no response from the support. Unfortunately, that kinda ruined my gift for his birthday. ",FortNiteBR

I think that it would be pretty nice if they could put it in how it was except based off of account level as opposed to seasonal level. Having items locked behind account level would allow for previous season's limited time skins to be available to players who purchased it then but couldn't afford it at the time. Granted, you would have to play a good amount and level up a lot in order to be able to purchase these items as otherwise there's no point in locking them behind account level in the first place.

I'd say the most requested skin on this sub for the past few days has been the skeleton trooper from season 1's Halloween event. In order to keep the most amount of people happy while still reintroducing it I believe it would fit into this model well. The people who are obsessed with keeping the skin ""OG"" would be sated and the people who have been playing the game will be able to purchase it. I would put the skin, along with red knight in with the required account level of 200+, this may sound crazy at first but stay with me. 200+ is obviously the easiest way to make sure people have played since season 1 if there isn't a current method of tracking, as it would require at least ~68 levels per season. I myself don't play that often and usually get burnt out at the end of each season, yet I still get to seasonal level 80-90.

Tl;dr - 

Make a shop that requires a certain account level so that people who want skins to be of will be happy and people who missed out on their chance can buy it if they have played enough of each season.",FortNiteBR

They are forcing the higher skilled players to use less powerful guns with the slower change times on weapons. Ex if you are in a 1v1 and go to pump a person after gaining height advantage it will take significantly more time to do so. With these unnecessary nerfs all they do is make it so the good players get worse and can't show their skills as much as older versions of the game.

Hear me out, I been into over 20 games with this new building mechanic and went to wailing woods to practice using it. I did eventually got use to it, but in combat situations you don’t really see a sudden increase in speed of building, yet a decrease in speed is noticable. I switch back to combat pro to test the speed between the two and combat pro is definitely the fastest one (for now atleast)... I do like the idea of the new controls though, besides using the left D-pad to change materials (strange feeling) but I think its needs a little improvement... Now it could also be that I used combat pro more which allows me to use it at its full potential, while the new controls I probably need to keep using it to get to that same level.

&amp;nbsp;

With the recent fortnite update, jailbroken devices are no longer supported no matter what workaround is attempted (including erasing our device completely, the game is still blocked). We do not do this to hack games or this one specifically, and I hope the fortnite community can understand that as fact. Nothing in the realm of this has been or even is currently in public development.

&amp;nbsp;

Regardless, I will attach the email I sent Epic pertaining to this below. I hope the community can come together and see that there really is no benefit from their decision to block our devices, only the alienation of a very specific group of people that love their game just like everyone else.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

To whomever it may concern:

I get it. Being jailbroken is a security risk and, from what I can gather, specifically a risk in the form of in-app purchase hacking and the like.

But what I don't understand is how you plan on releasing Fortnite for android. Jailbreaking an iphone is doing no more than opening up the iOS software system to a state that androids are already at in their stock configuration.

On top of this, it must be stressed, you are alienating a VERY specific user-base at this point. I need to point out that back in the day jailbreaking would be at times synonymous with hacking because there was always a jailbreak available for the current version of iOS. With this ability, people jailbroke their phones solely to hack games and this turnover would happen quite rapidly due to the support the internet was able to provide to immediate possibility of jailbreaking your phone no matter what version it was running.

No longer is this the case. Every jailbreak released is for an old software, so those of us jailbroken have waited and stayed on a version of IOS for it to be potentially released. We did not do this in hopes of a hack for a game that was not even released at the time to be developed. On top of this, it's now impossible for anyone to develop a ""fortnite hack"" and disperse to a large number of users that jailbreak their phone SOLELY to hack a game because you would have to be running iOS 11.1.2 or lower. This just doesn't happen anymore. Those of us that are jailbroken do everything we can to stay jailbroken because we use it for more than simply hacking of games or other such specific, shortsighted endgame reasons. This is a barrier that really is not necessary and could be handled on a case by case basis (if it were to even happen) in a much better and responsible way as a game developer.

At the end of the day, I will not give up my jailbreak for fortnite and I think it is shameful to punish those of us that have no intention of negatively impacting the fortnite community by creating such a harsh and blanket-functioning system of detection. I ONLY began playing fortnite once it came out on mobile because I love the way it plays on the phone. The iOS port is what got me into the game. As of now, I have spent over $70 on skins in the game. But no longer will I support a game development team that chooses to not support me as a paying and positive Epic community member. You are forcing a loyal customer that has been a fan of Epic since the original Gears of War (which I had to get my mom to buy for me it was so long ago) out of the community and quite literally in this case.

Please, there has to be a better way of coming together on this issue to find a solution.

It seems like a lot of players on this forum seem to assume that the speed at which they can perform actions should directly relate to game success. This is patently untrue. Just because you CAN edit through a wall while someone is behind it doesn’t mean that it should guarantee the kill. Just because you CAN switch to your shotgun after building a walk doesn’t mean that it needs to be without delay. 

Look at examples from many other games that have much deeper, more firmly established metas; in many of them, the player with the most technical ability is almost never the best player in the scene. Take CSGO for example; Scream’s aim is generally regarded as the best, but Scream really isn’t in the conversation for best CSGO player. Same goes for SSBM. Hax$, while he had heathy wrists, was easily the most technically capable player in the entire scene, and he didn’t win a single major. 

TL;DR: in my opinion, technical ability does not always translate to player skill.  ",FortNiteBR

When everyone first picked up the game it was a different shooting mechanic from anything they have played (like every new shooter we play). So everyone got used to it and mastered it. They learned the speed of the game. 
Now that there’s this update with a change in the speed everyone is freaking out but...... you’ll get used to it. We all will, and be just as good as before. Why the huge outcry over your candy getting taken away? We have a new candy now. The rules, or speed rather, has changed. You’ll get used to it and forget what it even was like when it was quicker. . 
Are these dumb posts and videos about the speed only inpatient people? 
.. “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it”, sure. But don’t flip over the game changing. Everything changes. That’s life. And in fact, how many things besides this gun switch are still the same in this game? So many updates. It’s nbd when a new weapon is added but you flip over the game mechanics changing..? I see this as a new challenge. Something new to master. If you’ve played any game for a long period of time it gets old. Maybe Epic just wanted to keep the game fresh and changed a key component to put everyone back to square one on an even field. Since *ahem* some of us have mastered, ruled, owned, and became kings of the game. To me this is a power move. They changed something so key to every players game that we now need to adapt. That’s evolution of a great game that does nothing but stay current. 

It’s a hard game. And unlike many other games like COD or even Halo that anyone could master in X amount of time.... this is different. Getting better requires you to survive longer. And that’s only exponentially harder when gamers have played for hours and hours, had the game since day 1, and mastered everything. It’s a survival game where a brand new player can be in the same game as a Vet. 
This is almost like a second release of the game that lets everyone (including me who didn’t pick up the game until later in its release) a fair playing field. 

I’ll end with this. Compared to any other game you’ve ever played, what game has more of an advantage to knowing the mechanics, and mastering the game? I find it hard to draw a comparison. This game is survival. Drops every player in the same field but we all have different skill levels. That’s really hard to start as a new player and that’s why they might have made this dramatic change. To try and give all the new gamers of this tsunami wave of a marketing campaign a fair shot.

Let's start off with first shot accuracy.

&amp;nbsp;

**FIRST SHOT ACCURACY THOUGHTS**

&amp;nbsp;

Initially I was very very hesitant about keeping in the game and was kinda on the side of thinking that its absolute shit… ngl. As I continued to play with the new mechanic I do feel more and more comfortable with it being a part of the game, but I do feel like there are some things that are kinda scuffed with it. To begin with I feel like the actual time that it takes to get your reticle to FSA when you stand still is a little delayed. I think it would be much more enjoyable if this mechanic where to function in a manner where at the moment you are standing / crouching still you are granted FSA. Currently there is just this awkward delay that just doesn't feel right at times. The second and final thing I want to note is that this system functions primarily at a very far range. I'm unsure if this is a good or bad thing but there’s no way to ignore that this system is pretty much built for one or two scenarios and not a complete overhaul of RNG of the aiming system, but i'm pretty sure that its intent isn't to remove RNG. Things that this mechanic does pretty well though is bring us 100% accuracy, so that's one step forward. Being able to have the option to actually hit people with accuracy is super nice compared to us not having that option at all at any range. One thing I would like from EPIC would be for them to publicly state their current views on combat and aiming in a DevBlog or something, maybe a lil word about what happened to the recoil based system that was leaked a while ago. Maybe even let us try it in a LTM? Just seems kinda awkward that this second option was scratched entirely and hidden away from the community with no word or talk about it. I understand that shift happen and motives change when it comes to game development, would be nice to understand why those shifts / motives take place though.

&amp;nbsp;

**WEAPON SWITCHING (WELCOME TO FORTNITE POLITICS BOYZZZ. :D)**

&amp;nbsp;

Okay. I seem to understand most of the communities views on this specific mechanic change.
Let me start off by trying to understand EPIC’s intentions. EPIC stated that this nerf was intented to “reduce the effectiveness of quickly switching between weapons for high burst-damage”. Personally I think this really isn't something that I think is wrong for EPIC to try to go for. In EPIC’s eyes they may see quickly switching to pump and other weapons being something that affects whatever plans they have for the game long term. But the primary concern from the community is that this nerf has reduced the skill cap / slowed down the pace of the game. The primary example that I’ve been hearing a whole lot about is the replace and edit peak strat. This is when you destroy someone's wall or floor then replace it with your own and edit a hole in it to create an opportunity to kill someone that is turtling (playing passively / boxing in and trying to heal). Many people feel as if the nerf on the pump switch allows the player that’s turtling a greater opportunity to fire back at you after you created the edit. My only question to anyone that shares this concern is why in the world are you editing then putting your face right in front of the whole you just edited? It makes no sense pre patch or post patch. The player within the box still has the opportunity to kill you pre patch when you don't properly execute on the replace and edit strategy, just because you haven’t been executing this strategy properly and you are now getting punished for it because of a slower switch speed doesn't necessarily mean that the game is being catered to the player at a “disadvantage”. And BTW, when it comes to that mechanic the only real advantage you have on the player is the unpredictability of the edit you decide to make and the time you peak. BUT IT'S NOT THAT HARD TO PREDICT YOUR PEAK WHEN YOU JUST RUN IN THE BOX EXPECTING A FREE FRAG. I’ve killed people pre and post patch trying to do this and it just doesn't work out for them because they do not perform this tactic correctly. Post patch I’ve performed the edit strat against multiple people and peaked them properly and I get the kill with a pump. I guess that's part one of my feelings toward that recent change. Now I want to talk about something that many people may not like to hear but may also very well be the sad truth. Over aggression, its a thing and I’m certain it's the main cause of headache when it comes to people hating the new system. And don't confuse me please, there is a clear difference between playing aggressive and and then being overly aggressive. Over aggression puts you in shitty situations / circumstances just because you don't feel like being patient or want to hit a cool clip for reddit to POGGER to. Now this isn’t an issue but now there are proper weapons for wanting that type of play, these weapons are the ones that have a higher fire rate and lower switch time (post patch). But in the past the pump was the only shotgun in the game that can 200 effective health to 0 effective health someone and with literally 0 disadvantage of doing so (pre patch). There isn't an issue with the way it now function post patch and it's not like you can’t be aggressive with the pump at all it's just that you have to think a bit more with a weapon that CAN LITERALLY ONE SHOT ANYONE AND HAS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AMMUNITION TYPES IN THE GAME. When it comes to the swap speed of the rocket launcher and the other big chunky damage dealing weapons in the game I feel like this logic was applied to them and the amount of power they have is being controlled with switch speed instead of nerfing their direct damage. And to be quite frank, I’ve played this patch a bunch and haven’t changed my way aggressive playstyle one bit and I perform just as well. Going into Solo v Squads may be something that's a bit more difficult to pull off with these changes, but Squads wasn’t designed to favor an individual against four others. Overall I think people talking about the skill cap being lowered is a huge reach and is not the case. Speed =/= higher or lower skill cap. Every strategy can still be executed post patch as pre patch. Shotgun roles are much much more clear with this patch and that's something that I appreciate about the patch personally. I think a lot of this patch is a comfort thing that most people would rather not adjust to because they are used to the pacing of things before, with that I think they are letting the discomfort of pacing get in the way of viewing that things are still effective. Altho the sniper does feel ditsy as fuck at times with being able to scope in and still not being able to shoot... thats off O.o

&amp;nbsp;

**HIYA THANKS FOR READING THIS LONG ASS POST**

&amp;nbsp;

I'm pretty sure that's all I had to say, I encourage everything to list out their thoughts on the patch in a constructive manner other than saying “ITS THE WORST PATCH OF ALL TIME REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE”. If you disagree with me, that's fine. If you agree with me, that's fine. If it gets reverted, that’s fine. If it doesn’t, that’s fine. My point in making this post is to voice my honest opinion, not to try to convince anyone that my way is right or wrong. Much love, and as always, Keep Believing.

- Builder Pro is a good addition to the game, but there could be a better solution than using the d-pad to switch materials.
- Separate Building Sensitivity for console would be fantastic now with the new configuration.
- Builder Pro needs to be introduced to StW, so we can share schemes between both games.
- Guided Missile can stay out of the game, good riddance.

First, the part that I am certain on. Build/Edit-to-Weapon delay should be gone completely. The skill of Fortnite is mastering the two main mechanics, combat and building. Even moreso, the ability to execute both of these seamlessly and efficiently is where this game becomes truly beautiful. That kind of mastery of the two isn't something we should be putting roadblocks in the middle of.  
  


Then comes weapon-to-weapon delay. This is inherently more complex, due to the number of weapons we're dealing with. That said, why does it make sense to treat every weapon the same in this regard?  
  


Here's what I think is the best solution. Single-shot damage should be *roughly* proportional to swap time(aside from a few exceptions). The bursting of one high damage weapon type throws the balance of all weapons in the air, and discourages weapon variety(weapon variety being something I think we all agree is healthy for the game). I'm not saying my idea is necessarily the best one, but here's my shot at it.  
  


Tier1: Slowest  

* Bolt-action Sniper  

* RPG  

* Guided Missile  

* Minigun  




Tier2: Slow  

* Grenade Launcher  

* Semi Auto Sniper Rifle  

* Hunting Rifle  

* Pump Shotgun  

* Heavy Shotgun  



Tier3: Medium(Pre-Patch Standard probably fits somewhere around here)  

* Tactical Shotgun  

* All Assault Rifles  

* Handcannon  



Tier4: Fast  

* Tactical SMG  

* Suppressed SMG(Probably can be removed already)  


Tier5: Fastest  

* ALL Pistols(Minus Handcannon)  


  

Again, it's not perfect, but in my opinion a scale in this form can work to satisfy current concerns and even increase weapon-use variety. What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

The game was literally perfect just a few weeks ago. It felt ridiculously smooth to play and gameplay was so satisfying. Obviously bugs aren't intentional, but everything that's happened recently is incredibly worrying for the future of the game.

The latest update has added

- Weapon switching delay, which significantly tones down the speed of the game, the responsiveness, and many people's enjoyment. For example, why on earth is their a delay when bringing out the Bolt? It was 100% never unbalanced whatsoever. Just don't let people carry two bolts or just make the reload process carry over somehow. It just feels terrible now. 

- The peek bug, which is almost worse, where high ground is essentially useless now, given how much of yourself you need to expose to shoot over walls and ramps. Just another thing that just is a big fuck you to builders and people who loved the state of the game.

- Guided missiles, 0 skill stand in cover and spam RPGs with no chance at being killed. Especially in squads, these are just no fun and no skill.

- Port-a-fort, it's not even OP but it's just such another thing that adds more RNG to the game. Why are you so against people building? You add the delay so that we can't shoot directly after editing, removing that skill entirely from the game. Then you add, perhaps inadvertently but add nonetheless, the peek bug  where even with high ground, there's no real advantage. And just to further emphasize how high you want the skill floor and to lower the skill gap, you add a fort that instabuilds requiring no user skill whatsoever. 

Epic, I love your game. Don't get me wrong, the only reason I would write this up in the first place is because it comes from a place of passion. Playing your game at it's best is exhilarating, and just a blast. Gameplay was some of the smoothest on the market today, it feels like Overwatch but for the Battle Royale genre.

**Please** heavily consider rolling back some of these changes and taking a look at the direction of the future of the game. I liked Paragon too, and look how that ended up. You have an invaluable opportunity with Fortnite right now. Please, for the sake of yourselves, do not squander it. I've completely stopped playing for now, I play occasionally when someone asks to play but the clunkiness of the gameplay has killed my desire to play solo completely. 

Roll back the weapon switch delay. 

Fix the peek bug ASAP.

Guided missiles... the nerf you put out before disabling them is a step in the right direction to make them balanced, but I still wonder if they really belong in the game. In solo, perhaps but maybe take a closer look at them. 

Portafort honestly I don't even have a huge issue with in it's current state, it's balanced enough I don't think it's too good or bad but it's just another step in what I personally consider a very frightening path. I love your game and would love for it to succeed. Listen to the players who play 5 hours+ a day. They play that much for a reason. ",FortNiteBR

What's their motivation to add something like this?  There is none!  They don't stand to profit in any way, quite the opposite, they'd be giving away tons of free skins.

(Console Players),"Let me preface by firstly saying Epic has been doing a tremendous job by throwing out constant patches and fixing servers when they need to be tampered with.

However, perhaps it was simply a misconception I constructed in my head, but when I heard builder pro was being implemented for console I thought we might have a fighting chance at matching up to the speed of PC play. While it definitely makes for faster building once you memorize the layout, it still doesn't feel right.

For those of you who have used it, you know you have to press B (I play on Xbox but same concept goes for PlayStation) to open building mode, then you have to tap RB/LB/RT/LT first to toggle select a building piece AND tap that same button again to actually place it. So you have to double tap the button to switch and then place, which works pretty well-but it could work even better.

In other words, I was under the impression that once we opened our builder mode, we could press RT once to actually place a wall, LT once for the stairs and so on rather than having to select them first. I believe Builder Pro could be made even better by allowing players to open building mode and being able to set their stair/wall immediately by pressing the input once.

Let me know your guy's thoughts!

TLDR; I believe Builder Pro could be made much more efficient by removing the 1st tap to select and making it into a tap once to place.",FortNiteBR

Which always had a huge opportunity for abuse. Epic likely didn’t intend for the meta to always be fire off your pump and switch to Tac, AR, Sub etc. The weapon delay adjusts the meta to now fight close range with the weapon you have out. It’s faster to shoot off your pump and wait for another pump shot, than to switch to an AR and finish off the kill. I agree that it’s kind of annoying and feels very slow, but it does address the long overdue issue of close range double weapon meta. It also helps level the playing field on console with button choices (combat pro vs. Standard), which double weapon switch was only really abusable on Combat Pro. I know most of you probably won’t agree with me, but I think the weapon delay is intended to adjust our play styles to the way Epic believes their game should be played. Cheers. ",FortNiteBR

Peaking over a wall is bullshit. You can be clearly visible and still not able to hit the enemy even though they can see you. This lowers the skill gap. People that didn’t know how to take high ground back, or how to challenge people who had highground properly are getting it made easier for them. STOP this shit. Do not make the game easier for people who do not take the time to learn how to play. 

My first win ever, I literally didn’t build a single thing. One moment this other noob placed a single wall in defense to my AR spam and I thought he was good and said “holy shit he’s building.” I was absolute trash. But I learned. I didn’t need the game dumbed down to make it easier. 

I know Epic will get more money for making it more casual friendly but that’s short term. Casuals get tired of games fast or don’t play them as much (won’t buy all skins etc). So you aren’t really going to make the profit better. The game is doing great already keep it good and it’ll only do better. 

On console this game isn’t smooth enough. The constant freezing during landing and gunfights is extremely annoying. Do not say “it’s because you’re already dead.” No it isn’t. I’ve froze mid gunfight and survived. I’ve froze and took damage, then died while not frozen. Also freezing during landing is proof it isn’t. 

Shotguns, at least on console, are really inconsistent. I’ll pump someone for 16 to the head then do 150 right after. 

Aim assist on console is too clunky. Locking onto downed people, locking onto the wrong squares when trying to edit stairs. Remove all of that. 

The thing about dumbing the game down for casuals, you aren’t really changing anything for them. Good players will still win. It’s just making the game clunky and less fun while doing so. 

Revert the dumb delay, the stupid peaking nerf, fix AA on consoles, and keep the game as is. Don’t make changes to shit that isn’t broken, don’t lower the skill gap for players who won’t even stick around in the first place. Look what happened to Destiny. Simple as that. They had a decent foundation, made the game casual to get more money, ended up making a shit game that even casuals don’t like.

I'm pretty much always looking for that victory every single match. I'm going to share some bullet points with you guys to share my strategy, maybe you can gain some insight/new ideas on your game style. 

_____________________________________________________

* Jump toward a far target. Most of the time if you find a landing spot far from the bus line, you'll be able to get looted up in peace without scrambling from the start.

* Utilize your shields properly. Start with 2 minis (if you find them), then move on to the big one. Slurp is good if you band aid up to 75 HP and want to top it off.

* Scan your horizons often. This will help you gain some situational awareness. Spotting squads incoming or just lollygagging is key.

* Time your approaches correctly. Should you engage that squad in front of you? Make sure you're close to the circle with enough time, or else you'll be pinched and be forced to rush in.

* Build with wood if you're being shot at. It has the most starting HP and help you in a squeeze. Use brick and metal when you're trying to build the fortress of doom.

* Understand your surroundings. There could be people up that huge mountain in front of you. Make sure to spot cover points such as trees if you want to approach without being seen.

* It's okay to lose sometimes! Don't get too frustrated. You can always smash that play button right afterwards. The key is to remain positive. Now that there's a replay system, you can view what you did wrong and work on that part of your game.

* Limit unnecessary resource use. If there's a way you can simply walk and jump to a point that doesn't hinder your time, go with that option. It will help when you need those valuable resources in a fight.

* Determine a good backup plan. If something doesn't the way you want to in a fight, try and find another way. For instance, that dude in another fort is sniping you pretty hard 1v1, maybe there's a way to build and flank?

* Lure your opponents in. If you've got some nice traps set up and for some reason they're not trying to destroy your base, take some pot shots and hit your head. Maybe they'll get suckered in?

* Open the supply drops. It is the best risk/reward in the game. They're always bound to have something really good in them! Except the mini gun, skip that.

* Lavish those wins! It feels really satisfying, doesn't it? Hopefully this advice I shared with you helps you achieve more!

I'm improving, along with some friends who are a bit less skilled than I. I just got my first solo win yesterday, and that was pure luck and a bit of strategy (my only strong suit). Both my pro friends and my noobish friends have agreed that the removal of the guided missile makes the game feel nicer and more fun, however, with the weapon delay the game feels, as many have said before me, clunky, slow, and a little bit unfinished.  Both of these things seem like they are to cater to the worse players, but they both aren't seen as a good feature by either.  It won't seem like a developer submitting to their community if you remove them, it will seem like developers taking feedback of their players.

Usually it is just a daydream that occurs when you are stumped on a math problem or can’t seem to finish the essay that is due tomorrow. It is quickly dismissed and you go back to working on your homework. But, I’m here to tell you to pursue this dream. If there was ever a time to drop out of school and start up your twitch streaming career, that time is now. Here are five reasons why.
	
Number One- There is a clear market for Fortnite streamers. Several members of the Fortnite community have already proved that this “daydream” is possible. Tyler Blevins, also known as Ninja, was one of the first people to capitalize on the Fortnite craze. The 26 year old from Grayslake started streaming Fortnite in October of 2017. Viewers became instantly obsessed with Ninja. Each and everyday, the viewers amassed on his stream. His stream quickly went from less than a thousand viewers, to more than 40,000. Viewers started subscribing and donating to him for him to make streaming a full time career. But, his popularity really exploded when Drake, Travis Scott, and Juju squaded up with Ninja. 700,000 viewers filled his stream, donating and subscribing like never before. Ninja now has 300,000 subscribers on twitch and 7.5 million subscribers on YouTube. Along with his fame comes fortune. It was most recently reported that he is making upwards of $875,000 a month just from Twitch. This number doesn’t even factor in the money he is making from YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter. Ninja isn’t the only streamer making a living off of Fortnite. He is just one in a long list of them. If you pursue streaming now, you too, can quickly be added to this list.
	
Number two- If the money alone wasn’t enough to make you want to drop out of school and start streaming, think of it this way. Would you rather go to school and sit in desks for hours upon hours every single day or play video games. I think everyone knows the answer to that question. School, for the most part, isn’t fun. Fortnite is fun. It’s as simple as that. 

Number 3- If you pursue streaming, you can probably live with your parent’s for a long time. If your parents are cool, you might be able to move your stuff down to the basement, and transform it into your own little layer. Even if they don’t you can still stay in your bedroom. You will see your siblings move out and go off to college, while you laugh and say “Lol you guys have to move out. I get to live with Mom and Dad forever!” Doesn’t that sound awesome? Like who wouldn’t want to spend another 18 or more years living with their parents? You can have them bring you down pizza and Mountain Dew, so you never have to leave your Xbox, so that you can maximize your stream time. I’m sure they too would love to do this. You don’t have to pay for rent or groceries or anything. While everyone else is out spending their hard earned money, you get to mooch off Mom and Dad. Isn’t that awesome?
	
Number 4- After college, people are always stressing about their job. It’s hard to find one and it’s hard to keep one. But with streaming, you are essentially your own boss. You set your hours. You decide what you’re going to do everyday. You don’t have to go into an office everyday and make awkward small talk with coworkers. You never have to be afraid of getting fired. And, like I said in number one, you can make more money streaming in one year than most other jobs will give you in ten.
	
Number 5- Another huge reason for dropping out of school and becoming a streamer is because chicks dig it. Imagine this, you're out and about one day and you strike up a conversation with an attractive young woman. She asks what your job is. You respond nonchalantly, “Yeah, I play Fortnite for a living”. Can someone honestly tell me that isn’t the best pickup line ever. Like come on, once she hears that, it's over. You can take her back home, right past your parents in the living room, down to the basement, and she can watch you play squads with the bois for a few hours.
	
Now, after hearing all this, don’t all of you want to drop out of school right now and start your streaming career? It’s a fool proof plan, really. Streaming is the job of the future and all of us should be a part of it.

I don’t think they should. Back when they came out, not many people believed in the game. They thought there was no way it could compete with PUBG and they were only playing it because it was free. They didn’t want to waste money on a game they thought wouldn’t be around for long. But people who bought the skins thought differently and wanted to support the devs to keep the free game running. If they just forget about who was here at the start and sellout I’m going to be disappointed. 

Why not make different skins for Friday the 13th? Or different variations of the Halloween skins and scythe so you can tell who just got it and who has had it?",FortNiteBR

Here's my take on it:

The conditions are identical with everything else (ping, server connectivity, etc.) held constant. Theoretically, a default skin has the exact same opportunity to beat Ninja as Ninja has to beat the default skin. Bloom, fall damage, zone damage, and now weapon swap delay are the SAME for everyone. The weapon swap delay doesn't give beginner players an advantage over skilled players. If skilled players are as good as they claim to be, they will adapt to the weapon delay and still run train on a lobby. 

The best analogy I can think of is a golf player who came in last place in a tournament blaming the wind for his poor play. The winner of the tournament experienced the same wind and just played better. If skilled players can't adapt to changes in the game that allow for a more methodical approach to eliminating enemies rather than a quick-edit, one-pump to the face tactic, they aren't skilled to begin with",FortNiteBR

Click the link to view an EPIC post about Custom Matches.

Custom matches just got released on the PS4 and XBOX but for how long and why?


Custom matchmaking has been around for a while now.
It has been added to the console (PS4 and XBOX)  on various occasions.

High profiling streamers and youtubers have had the privilege to take advantage of the option.

HOW TO OBTAIN  A KEY:
There is no evident way as yet to obtain a working key.
BUT
Reports and rumours are pointing towards the new EPIC friends feature being compatible and suitable for the custom matchmaking option.

Players will potentially be able to invite players from PC and also various players they have met on the console they reside on. 

When will we know about custom matchmaking?
Who knows to be honest, EPIC couldn't even fix the servers for 18 hours..
But the signs point to a progressing step towards custom games.

Why dont they just open custom games?
This question has been asked many times and tweeted on many occasions. 
EPIC games wants to continue the fluency of Battle Royale.
Opening the portal to play custom games may affect gameplay, match lobby numbers and negatively effect servers.

The reddit links have been removed for unknown reasons. ",FortNiteBR

There are 44 countries in Europe. Alot of the time if I look at the profile of someone I died to I see screenshots of a menu in a foreign language. As fortnite is clearly growing at an exponential rate I think it's fair to 'suggest' that Epic look at adding an option when you select to match make to queue a little longer for a more Localised lobby. I would gladly spend longer getting into a match with people that reside in my own country. The LAG in a 1 v 1 with someone in a different country is terrible. 

What's everyone else's thoughts? I'm sure I'm not the only one who connects to a match filled with people from multiple countries. Surely now is the time to explore location based matchmaking more local than the server which caters for multiple countries

* First squad mode is standard. Just as it is now.
* Second squad mode is standard BUT you can't go in with friends. So you will be teamed up with random people

*We’ve seen the feedback on [the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7zke1s/state_of_the_subreddit_rules_discussion_edition/) regarding the length and format. We tried to do our best to make points short and concise, but we often choose to make long and detailed posts because of many factors (with the major one being sticky space — each subreddit is only allowed a maximum of 2 at a time).*

*I have added a* ***TL;DR*** *to the end of every section if you prefer to read those, though you may miss some of the details and reasoning behind our actions.*

&amp;nbsp; 

Since the last post, we’ve seen a huge boom in both new users and page views. Here are some stats about the subreddit

* We’ve been averaging around 6 million page views per day
* 5500+ new subscribers per day
* 4500+ posts per day

The above numbers are great! However, this one is not so great 

* 1000+ post removals per day (***please*** read the rules before you post everyone)

Out of the 4500 posts per day, almost a quarter of them get removed (thanks to our incredibly hard working mod team!), but even with all the removals, we miss a lot of posts due to the sheer volume of posts. We kindly ask all users to *please* use the “report” button on any post or comment that you think breaks our rules found at /r/FortniteBR/wiki/rules. Reports are a ***huge*** help, and they assist us in taking action on offending posts much quicker.

&amp;nbsp; 

To help with the influx of users, we’ve added a few new moderators. Most of them have already been actively moderating the last few weeks already, but we decided to add their announcement into this post. Please welcome /u/dasoxarechamps2005, /u/iDetroy, /u/imtcce, and /u/MasterGoat in the comments! Additionally, we may be adding a couple more from the previous pool of applicants in the coming days/weeks.

On the other hand, we are sad to see /u/Soggydoughnuts step down as a moderator due to real life responsibilities. He was a fantastic mod and we wish him the best &lt;3

- 6 million page views per day
- 4500 new posts per day. 1000+ post removals by mods per day. Please read the rules and report any posts you think break the rules.

##**Survey Results and Memes**

A month and a half ago, we posted a survey that would help shape some of the rules on the sub. Here are the results

[Raw data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JSjnZmWBZR5zqAQU1qmeSHZ8QjO1ucXxFp2q8TD2j60/edit?usp=sharing)

[Some quick graphs here](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/357730228665319426/417849155952836609/unknown.png?width=960&amp;height=199)

&amp;nbsp; 

As mentioned in the prior post, it has been difficult keeping up with the many low quality meme posts. We posted the current meme rules and received a lot of feedback. According to the survey, a majority of users thought the best approach was requiring a post flair with the same restrictions. However, second highest group was no meme restrictions. These are virtually 2 opposite opinions, so no matter what we decide, a large majority of people will be unhappy. 

Ultimately, the mod team agreed with the majority; memes will be allowed under the same restrictions (though we need to do a better job of sticking to our rules and not allowing exceptions when a post gets heavily upvoted) but will now require the ""Humor"" post flair.

&amp;nbsp; 

***TL;DR:*** 

- Results to the survey we made [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7zke1s/state_of_the_subreddit_rules_discussion_edition/) regarding memes.
- Majority of users wanted all posts to have a post flair with the same restrictions. Second highest group was no meme restrictions. Virtually 2 opposite opinions, so no matter what we decide, a large majority of people will be unhappy. 
- Memes are allowed under same restrictions but must have ""Humor"" flair

&amp;nbsp;

##**Flairs &amp; Filters**

**This is quite long so feel free to only read the TL;DR*

&amp;nbsp; 

The first trend is a heavy majority of you think that Post flairs should be required on either some posts or all. As a mod team, we decided to **require ALL posts have a flair**.

Our main designer /u/MasterGoat has implemented a ‘toggle filter’ system so users can pick and chose what they want to see, and this feature can be seen live above the posts/comments sections where it says ""Active Filters"". Here you'll also see all of our currently [available filter categories](https://imgur.com/a/OPb2w): Bug, Discussions, Suggestions, Media, Creative and Humor.

&amp;nbsp; 

\**Note: the Media filter will hide all posts with the flair ""Media"", ""Streamer"" and ""Screenshot""*

&amp;nbsp; 

If you click one of them, you will be forwarded to a view of the subreddit which will *hide* submissions with that flair (i.e. if you click ""Humor"", it will forward you to ""the subreddit without the humor flair"". The little eye icons next to the flair in the ‘Active Filters’ bar indicate whether you currently *see* the flair ([regular eye](https://imgur.com/a/Vh5jl)) or whether it's hidden from your view ([crossed out eye](https://imgur.com/a/DsNls)), this is also reflected by greying out the filter. You can click on the flairs in the active filter bar to freely pick and choose if you want to add or remove additional filters!


Unfortunately, this feature is only available for our PC users due to Reddit mobile’s limited functionality. However, for other filtering methods for our RES users and Mobile users, or for more details on the magic behind the filter, feel free to visit our [Subreddit Documentation](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBR/wiki/subreddit-filtering) which explains this system in detail. 

&amp;nbsp; 

**When you post, you will receive a PM as well confirming that you will have a grace period of 30 minutes to flair your post appropriately, or it will be automatically removed**. Requiring post flairs should assist all users and allow for better filtering.

&amp;nbsp; 

\**We will be providing a grace period for the first few days/week(s). Our bot won’t automatically remove it after 30 minutes, and all removals will be manual. The rule will be the same, but it won’t be automatic which means the removals might be a bit delayed. Feel free to report any posts that don't have a flair after 30 minutes of it being posted.*

&amp;nbsp; 
 
After you submit a post, you will have an option of 8 flairs to choose from to flair your post.

* **Bug** - For newly discovered bugs outside the patch megathread.

* **Discussion** - For your general posts about anything.

* **Suggestion** - For all your in-game ideas, including game modes and low effort skin suggestions. Please remember that suggestions must follow our post title guidelines of no ""Title Only Posts""

* **Media** - For your clips and any other media that meets the promotional guidelines.

* **Streamer** – For any post relating to a Fortnite streamer (e.g. Ninja this, Ninja that)

* **Screenshot** – For all your amazing screenshots! (With the new replay system we look forward to seeing the amazing shots the community puts up on this flair!)

* **Creative** - For Fanmade content, including 3D printed items, cosplays, artwork for ideas and high effort skin concepts.

* **Humor** - For your jokes, funny posts, and memes that meet the meme guidelines.

 --- 

* **Epic** - This flair will only show up when an Epic employee creates a thread or comments on a thread. You can find Epic posts by clicking on the Epic Games logo under the header of the sub!

&amp;nbsp; 

***TL;DR:*** 

- Toggleable flair filter system and how it works
- All posts will require the user to set their own flair
- Pick the right flair from the list above
- 30 minute grace period to set flair before auto removal 

&amp;nbsp;

##**Known Community Issues**

In case you guys didn't know, Epic has made a [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues) to track the hottest community issues that they are either investigating, need more information on, or have fixed in a future update! When you find a ""new"" bug, please check the Trello board or the most recent patch megathreads before making a new post. 

&amp;nbsp; 

***TL;DR:*** 

- Check the [public Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Bs7hgkma/fortnite-community-issues) to see if Epic already knows about a bug and for the ETA of the fix.
- Hopefully this reduces spam on the subreddit.

There are YouTubers who clickbait, Instagram/Social Media pages who steal content from the subreddit and don't credit the OP, and many reminders by fellow Redditors to watermark your posts. If you don't want your OC to be stolen by someone else on the Internet, please watermark it. [Example of Good Watermark vs. Bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/87hy9g/how_to_watermark_your_work_so_that_filthy/) by /u/Bromeek. [Another good example](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/89hwar/im_a_simple_man_i_see_a_watermark_i_upvote/) done by TheSneakyBros (they make phenomenal concept art that you can see on Twitter @TheSneakyBro!).

However, reminders to watermark your work, watermarks that say something like ""Not for &lt;Insert YouTuber&gt;"", screenshots of people stealing from Reddit, screenshots of a clickbait thumbnail, or anything similar to are not allowed under our ""Witch Hunting"" rule and will be subject to removal. 

&amp;nbsp; 

***TL;DR:*** 

- We know people steal stuff
- Watermark properly (examples above)
- Don't have watermarks that say ""Not for &lt;Insert YouTuber&gt;"", screenshots of people stealing from Reddit, screenshots of a clickbait thumbnail, or anything similar

##**Server Status**

You may have noticed a [new ""wifi"" icon](https://imgur.com/a/pfplc) on the menu bar of /r/FortNiteBR. Please use this button to check the status of Epic's servers before posting about matchmaking/login issues. We hope this will prevent the flood of posts in ""new"" whenever an outage occurs. Mobile users can access this link by tapping the ""..."" icon on the top right of the app and then pressing ""community info."" It is the first link under ""Useful Links.""

&amp;nbsp; 

***TL;DR:*** 

- Check to see if the servers are down by clicking the new wifi icon on the menu bar at the top.
- Hopefully will reduce duplicate posts.

##**Summary**

You will see that requiring post flairs and enabling a stronger filter covers the answers from the survey. People can see whichever type of content they want, and ignore the content they do not want to see.

While the filters may not be perfect or to your liking as an individual, it is a strong first step to maintaining a clean, fun, and high-quality subreddit.

Just because there is like a 1 second delay? That makes no sense.",FortNiteBR

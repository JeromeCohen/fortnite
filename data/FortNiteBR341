# [View Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/j3djcCk.png)

# [View Source Code](https://github.com/AltimorTASDK/ClientSettingsEditor)

## Features

* Set mouse sensitivity to an exact value
* Set values like HUD scale outside of their normal range
* Add custom binds
    * Slow walk on PC with InputScale for your John Wick roleplay
    * Turn binds! Use TurnAtRate and LookUpAtRate with InputScale set to the desired degrees per second. Use a negative InputScale to turn left or look down.

## Instructions

You can start either by opening your cached ClientSettings file at ""User\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Cloud\[Epic account id]\ClientSettings.sav"" or using File -&gt; Cloud Import to download it off Epic's cloud.

When you use Cloud Import or Cloud Export, you'll be given a login window that looks and functions like the Epic launcher's. If you don't want to type your account info into a third party program, use Google or Facebook single sign-on.

**Saving over the cached file won't do anything!** You have to use Cloud Export to upload the edited file for your changes to take effect.

To change a property's name or value, just edit the text boxes.

To duplicate or delete a property, right click it and use the context menu. When duplicating a property, the copy will be placed directly after the original. This is how you add and remove keybinds.",FortNiteBR

Would be pretty cool to aim and shoot with the bumbers, because many people might aleardy be used to it from other games like Call Of Duty. Also using bumber buttons waste less battery in Xbox controller than using trigger buttons. Also playing the ""claw"" would be much easier if you could shoot with bumbers.

Tonight I am quite dissapointed. I just tried to log in to my Epic Games Launcher, only to find out my account has been permanently closed due to fraud...

Let me back this up 4 days to May 4th. I was online, just won a squad game with some friends. I went to the washroom for no more than 3 or 4 minutes. Upon returning, I was at a login screen within the game, with a notification implying I had been logged in else where. In my email was a very recent receipt from Epic Games.

Long story short, someone seemingly hacked my account and purchased the $59.99 Deluxe Edition of Save the World in the couple of minutes I had gone to the washroom. I was home alone btw so no one pulled a fast one on me. Epic emailed me notifying me of suspicious login activity and everything.

Being a broke college student, the $60 USD was a hefty fee, so I immediately (within 5 mins of the malicious purchase) opened a ticket with Epic and PayPal. 

After 3 days, Epic still hadn't replied to me and PayPal deemed that the item was refundable. Great. I was mostly trying to avoid going into overdraft.

The next day (today), I am permanently banned for fraud because I assume the PayPal transaction bounced. 

I opened up a ticket with this information, and the Case # to the refund request from the other day when I was hacked. And the reply I got from Travion was:

 &gt;Bans for any reason are not issued unless they are rightfully warranted. For this reason your ban will not be overturned.

&gt;Due to internal security policy (and the protection of our software) we cannot disclose the methods that are used to identify any infraction.

**Any advice?**

tl;dr Was hacked, hacker bought Save the World Deluxe Edition, changed password and requested refund through Epic and PayPal. PayPal processed my refund request, now Epic thinks I was trying to fraudulently buy the PvE version of the game...

Keep in mind I have bought about $70 USD worth of vbucks aswell in the past. It would be nice not to lose this.

Thanks in advance,

Is there something that can be done against a Fortnite's official Discord super moderator? (not an Epic employee),"I'll elaborate and also provide a tl;dr afterwards, so please bear with me! I ""cencored"" the name of the mods, because I don't know if they'd like me to type their names here. I haven't censored the super-moderator in question. I also have screenshots of most of these things, even though I don't think that even the mod would deny any of the information below.

A little over a month ago (April 4th) I noticed a mod had a very unique and nice discord tag number (let's call them X, and say it the tag was #5555). At first, I wanted to jokingly type in general chat something along the lines of 'whose dick did you have to suck for that name tag?!' However, seeing how we are not acquaintances, I rephrased it and jokingly typed the following in general chat:

&gt;""@X#5555 so whose dick so I have to suck to get such a cool Discord number tag like yours? (5555)""

After a couple of seconds, I was instantly banned. I thought they have decided to ban me themselves, and somehow took offense, so I tried to PM them something along the lines of:

&gt;""REALLY?!?!?! IM JUST JOKING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A SICK DISCORD TAG DUDE D:""

However, the message did not go through (because we were no longer in a common channel, nor were we friends.

I proceeded to explain the situation to a guy from the channel who happened to send me a friend request just prior to the event, and asked him to send the message to X on my behalf. 

I then decided to try and handle it myself, by making an alternate account (just for communication purposes), and do that myself. I PM'd another mod (IIRC, X didn't respond, so I tried speaking to another mod, instead) and asked for the name of the mod who banned me. As it turns out, it wasn't X who had banned me, but another moderator - Soulrift. I PM'd Soulrift, explained that I didn't mean to offend X, and in fact - I even rephrased the sentence I initially meant to send, just to be in the clear, and that I made this account for communication purposes only.

He perma banned the account, reason: ban evasion.

I then made another account, spoke to the mod who directed me to Soulrift (and whose name I don't recall, but Soulrift obviously knows their identity), and explained the situation. The mod has agreed that a perma ban is not justified in this case, and spoke to Soulrift. 

I was then informed that they have agreed to lift the ban within 2 days. 

After a few hours, the same friend on Discord whom I asked to PM X on my behalf, has said that X has agreed to unban me if I promise to be nice, and to PM them. I never bothered doing that, nor have I bothered coming back 2 days later to make sure my account gets unbanned.

I was never active there, I just found it ridiculous, as I do now, that you'd get perma banned over such comment. 

Today I made another account to try and get my real account unbanned. As I said, I forgot the name of the mod I spoke to, and at that point, I also forgot who was the mod who has banned me (Soulrift), so I PM'd a mod whose name sounded familiar, in hopes it was the same mode who directed me to Soulrift a month ago. Let's call them Y.

I explained Y the entire situation, and they told me that it wasn't them, and reminded me that it was Soulrift who placed the ban April 4th. I PM'd Soulrift: 

&gt;""Soulrift?""

A couple seconds later, I get banned with the following reason:

&gt;""ban evasion. stop harassing the moderators. you have been told your initial account ban holds, end of story.""

I then made a new account, and PM'd him again; explained that I did not harass, but I forgot the name of the mod, and that you guys (Soulrift and the mod) have told me that I would get unbanned within 2 days. 

I get banned again with the following reason:

""Nope. ban evasion #5""

I then made another account and PM'd Y, told them what has been going on, and they said that there's pretty much nothing they can do; the mod team works in ""unity"" (what a creative way to spell dictatorship), and since Soulrift is the higher up, X (the mod with the nice Discord tag) would probably not have a say in this.

It sounded weird to me, because after all, it's supposed to be the official Discord for Fortnite, so how come Epic has no say in it? Y explained that seeing how Epic has no time to moderate the Discord channel (obviously), they have hired a ""trusted and trained"" people to do that, and Soulrift has been there since day one.

At this point it's just frustrated and have no where to turn to but here. Yes, it's just a Discord channel, and most importantly - I am not even active there (I didn't even bother making sure I get the ban lifted, and it's been over a month), but I just find it ridiculous that I would get permanently banned from the **official FORTNITE's Discord channel** because a moderator has decided that my comment was so not in-place, that I'm basically a monster now and should be kept away at all costs.

I just want access to the Discord channel again. Whether you find my comment funny/childish/disgusting or what not - I think we can all agree that a perma-ban is ""slightly"" over the top. It's simply a power abuse. It's his choice not liking my comment, but perma-banning me over this? *Especially* when the mod who's in the center of all of this (X) was willing to lift the ban?! Ridiculous!

**tl;dr:**

X is a mod on the official Discord channel and has a sick Discord tag number. On April 4th I jokingly type:
&gt;""@X#5555 so whose dick so I have to suck to get such a cool Discord number tag like yours? (5555)"" 

And get perma-banned for it by Soulrift (Super-Moderator). I then speak to another mod, who speaks to Soulrift, and they inform me that they will lift the ban within 2 days. X (the mod with the nice tag), also says that they will unban me (asked a friend to send them a PM on my behalf when I was under the impression they were the one who banned me, because they found it offensive).

I never bothered making sure the ban actually gets lifted. Today (a little over a month ago), I make an account to try and make sure my real account finally gets unbanned. Soulrift bans the account and says that I have been told the ban would remain intact (no; I was not told that; on the contrary). I make another account, reminding him that it wasn't the case, but to no avail - he isn't willing to speak and bans me again. 

Another mod tells me that probably not even X (the guy with the nice tag) would be able to unban me at this point, because Soulrift has the final say, explaining that he has been hired by Epic (since they don't have time to moderate the Discord channel. He isn't an Epic employee, though) and has been here since day one.",FortNiteBR

What made me continue playing this game was that EPIC listens to the community and it’s nice bumping into famous streamers. Was doing duos with a friend and it just so happened that the last Duo was JASONR and so I tuned into his stream to say gg and he responded back with a well played by us. The in game community of this game is nicer than any other game community I’ve experienced. League, no matter what rank you are (bronze silver gold, plat diamond etc you’ll get trolls and it only takes one to lose you a game.

Now that thats out of the way I'm looking to collect some data about possible esports formats. If you're interested in fortnite as an esport, either as a player or a spectator,  I'd like to hear your opinions.  From this point on I will use the term “team” to describe the competitors regardless of if it's 1v1 2v2 4v4 or XvX.

I see 2 clear formats for how a competitive fortnite event can be ran.

1. This format would most resemble a normal game of fortnite with gameplay being unchanged. The teams will be split into subgroups and a sort of round robin would take place with the goal being to expose each team to each other team as evenly and as often as possible.  Each phase of the tournament would see the bottom performing % of teams (based on placement) eliminated from the tournament.  Once you have under 100 remaining players you're essentially in grand finals and you'll play a series of games with those same &lt;100 people to determine final placings.

Pros: Can easily accommodate any number of players making qualifiers somewhat optional. Stays true to the way 99% of viewers play the game.

Cons: more rng based.  Hard to catch simultaneous action on screen. Probably needs in game spectating support to allow viewers to watch their favorite players instead of whatever the main camera is on. Kind if a clusterfuck to organize. Higher potential for anti climactic finals or people feeling like their favorite team got robbed. Legitimate concerns regarding collusion.


2. This format would be more arena based. How mats and equipment is handled is open to discussion but it wouldn't be like a normal game. The game would take place in a much smaller map and would be 1 team vs 1 team. The focus would be coordinated team based strategies and building rather than the chaos and random elements of a standard match. The actual tournament format would be what most people are used to with winners and loser brackets and bo3s or bo5s.

Pros: less rng. Less simultaneous action makes camerawork and commentary easier without missing much. Traditional brackets that everyone is used to. No collusion possible.

Cons: removes large aspects of the game.  Less relatable to casual viewers. Less simultaneous action means you can't cut to a different fight if the one on screen slows down.


So what does /r/fortnitebr think? Do you guys like one of the options I mentioned? Do you have an idea of your own? Are you interested as a potential viewer? A potential player? Both?

 Think about it isn't Battle Royal just a fad right now? Sure its a fad thats here to stay for a while but its a fad non the less. Why not guarantee prosperity while your game is still hyped and branch out? 
 A good place to start would be the addition of a new game mode lets just call it Fortnite Respawn. A third multiplayer experience that feels like a traditional fps. It would have like Team death match 12v12 in a closed of area like Tilted or Greasy. Imagine a conquest style 50v50 were major points of interest were objectives and holding it gains you points or you could get points by killing. Create a loadout, pick a class, medics get bandages and slurps, supports can drop ammo crates, engineers get c4 or sticky grenades, ect. Spawn with a limited amount of wood each life non player made structures cant be destroyed., When you die your structures are destroyed. Oh and of course cosmetics are transferred over.

And we also had the ReplayRoyale contest. I was playing a match and I thought about having a custom skin, and how cool it would be to have my own custom skin in the game. I think it would be a great idea for epic to setup an event where anyone can compete in creating their own skin idea. And obviously the winners would get their skin in the game and maybe some other rewards. 

So yeah plz comment, share or upvote so we can get this to EPIC.

-Is epic milking fortnite dry for money? 

-Imo, yes

-Why?

Because what they're advertising and how they're doing it...While the games state is still not the best.. Let me remind you ..

-This whole superhero/marvel thing is really dumb too and not like Fortnite at all.


Epics suit and ties seen an oppurtunity with this whole mainstream super hero movie's that has recently come out. So they have partnered up with marvel (*for a limited time that is..*) lol

And theyve been making alot of money, there for why should they have to care about the bugs and frequent issues in their game? Well its just that.. They do have to but in a way that pleases the people!

Sooo.....

New skins and emotes ! ( $ ) ( $ )

New content is great and all but they are one company. Different teams or not there is a higher staff that makes these decisions. All the while the game is still having its issues they push the whole mainstream marvel/superhero BS to please the 80% of their player base!

Also, why LMGs? To me, they're just SMGs with more range.

Another thing, the minigun needs to be adjusted. Hardly anyone picks it up because it requires an absurd amount of ammo to use. I believe a good change would be to make it have magazines of about ~200-250. That way it begins with a good amount of ammo so that it's usable, but picking it up wouldn't simply mean you have virtually unlimited ammo for SMGs and pistols.

The Current Shooting Model,"I'm going to make this short and too the point. The game has absolutely shitty shooting mechanics. Tons of problems can be traced to this problem but the most obvious is the dominance of shotguns. Simply put they are the only guns worth having while your character is moving at all. Every other weapon is a RNG machine if your character is moving at all. I understand Epics positions on why they have the shooting the way it is, but the fact that shotguns are the only guns worth using while moving is extremely annoying and should be the case. I have a few examples of why the current shooting model needs to change.




1. Jump Shooting and Strafing 


Usually in a shooting game movement can be used to throw your opponents aim off while you try to gun them down. In fortnite you can only do this with shotguns. So if you want to shoot while jumping or strafing you need to use a shotgun.


2. First Shot Accuracy 


This feature completely destroys the play style of high accuracy weapons such as the Hand cannon and revolver. The fact that you have to remain completely motionless in order to hit your shots removes the ability to use aiming skills like flicks or strafes. This seriously needs to be addressed. These weapons are pretty much useless because of this feature. 


3. Bullet Spread 


This feature completely eliminates the ability to compete with shotguns with SMGs or pistols. In addition to needing first shot accuracy to be effective the guns depend on your ability to hit as many shots as possible in a short amount of time. Combined with the fact they can't be aimed properly while jumping and the RNG bullet pushes they stand no chance against shotguns at close range.



To fix these problems I propose a simple solution.


1. 100 Percent Accuracy Shooting Model 

This would add the ability all weapons to be used in the way they were intended to be used. This  would also allow all weapons to be used while in motion.


2. Recoil Based on Fire Rate and Shooting Power


This feature would balance the 100% accuracy model by making players fight the recoil on each weapon and thus not being able to instantly laser opposing players. Recoil could be determined by weapon type, rarity, fire rate and fire power (damage per shot).


3. Damage drop off in increments of 10s of Meters 


This feature would be necessary to make sure each weapon is used in its effective range and to prevent abuse of certain weapons.

Proposed Drop off Ranges


Shotguns : 15-20 meters 


SMGs : 20-30 meters


Pistols : 30-40 meters 


Revolvers and Hand Cannon : 50-75 meters


ARs and Bursts : 50-100 meters

(Btw this numbers are strictly theoretical and would need play test)

Combat Pro,"If you were like me and heavily debating whether to switch from Combat Pro to Builder Pro and are just looking for a real reason to make the switch, let me give you best the reasons that I’ve found from my few weeks of playing with BP. 

  Like some of you I found no reason to switch. I was super comfortable with CP and won most of my gunfights anyways. I didn’t find a real reason to switch because why fix what isn’t broken. Well then a redditor said to me stop being ignorant and give it a try, and so I did. Believe me when I say my gameplay has never been better. With BP my building has become something of an art. I almost never misplace or select the wrong piece, I’m 100x more consistent, and transitions from piece to piece couldn’t be smoother. BP allows for me to win the fights I’d normally win with CP with complete dominance. No longer is it a “what if” for if I’ll win a battle but now a curb stomping because other players can’t keep up.  A lot of those big end game fights that use to be 50/50 are now more like 70/30 regardless of who I’m fighting simply because of the fact that I can place ramps and walls consistently faster than my opponent. The mere seconds of an advantage that BP gives you makes all the difference. And BP is super easy to learn and master because it keeps all the combat controls from CP the same. 

Coming from someone who was also extremely hesitant to switch, I strongly recommend it especially if you’re someone who drastically wants to improve their gameplay. It may take a couple attempts of getting use to (took me 3) but once it happens, you’ll never look back. ",FortNiteBR

I realize that Epic wants to entice people into playing every day by requiring that login, but let's be honest here.  Epic doesn't need to do any enticing.

With as popular as this game is, there are plenty of people playing and spending money on it.  I personally have tossed my fair share of money for a couple skins, gliders, and pickaxes and I'm sure I'm one of the more conservative spenders in the game.  But even then I don't want to play the game **every night**.  I play at least every 3 days and usually more than that, but I do get burned out after a few consecutive nights of playing.

All I ask is that my dailies accrue to a max of three without me having to boot the game up just to logout after confirming my new daily is acquired.  I don't have an iOS device so I can't login on my phone, and sometimes I'm just simply not at my computer that evening.  It's just frustrating that sometimes I don't have a daily or two to complete just because I forgot or was unable to boot the game one night.  Other F2P titles like Hearthstone will give you dailies up to the max regardless of whether you actually login.  Why can't Fortnite?

tl;dr: It's frustrating that you have to boot the game in order to claim dailies.  They should accrue without needing to login and boot the game.  It would be a major QoL improvement.",FortNiteBR

Over the weekend, my youngest begged to play with me even though I was squadding with some of my buds who are all pretty good players.  They agreed to let him join knowing he would probably die the first minute every drop. (Thanks guys for understanding!)  

We decide to drop remote relative to the bus route which puts us dropping at Yonder / Palettes.  My youngest hasn't dropped here since Season 4 started and finds the dance club! OMG the reaction. He just immediately falls in love with the place and throws a fit about leaving, which we make him do because of the circle. He throws a full blown tantrum about making him leave the ""Party"" to the point I mute him in Xbox party chat :)

We all wipe a few minutes later and he's constantly on me about going back to the ""Party"".  My squad agrees to drop Yonder again though the bus route is not as friendly and we know we won't be alone this time. 

Of course, we aren't alone.  The 3 of us loot up and immediately engage the other squad to try and protect my Autistic kid.  Meanwhile, my kids runs straight into the club, loots a chest and some ground loot, then immediately starts dancing. 

We die pretty easily to this squad, who is obviously a very good group of players while my kids is still in the club dancing.  We all are spectating my kid at this point.  The enemy squad runs into the club and sees him in the middle of the dance floor.  At this point I'm thinking ""oh crap"". They surround him and just watch probably laughing that he is so oblivious.  He wants them to dance with him so he throws a boogie bomb at his feet.  All 5 of them proceed to dance LOL.  They still don't engage. They watch him dance for another few minutes and leave.  At this point, we try to get him to quit so we can start a new game and he refuses, so we leave him and go start a new game.  He's alone still dancing in the club 10 minutes later!  Thanks to the first 3 circles, he stays in the club until the 4th circle with a game time of like ~16 minutes. He's finally forced out of the club and runs into the next circle and straight into a squad and kamikaze's. He finished 3rd! He was so proud, he went get his mom to show her he finished 3rd ""by himself"".   He then proceeds to tell me ""I'm no fun and the enemy squad is more fun cuz they danced with him"". ROFL.

Thank you to the enemy squad for just dancing with the lone  oblivious no skin even after he boogie bombed you and thanks to Epic for making a game that caters to all ages and types.

TLDR: Enemy Squad kills 3 of us and dances with my Autistic kid in the Yonder Yard club after he boogie bomb's them. Finishes third by just dancing in the club.

I recalculated milestones for every week. This time based on this post :

Level 80 requires **546 050 points**. We get 5K XP from challenges each weeks so that's 50K ""free"" XP, dropping the require XP to 496 050. Dividing this amount by the weeks is giving those milestones \(free xp taken into account and assuming they're done the week challenges are dropped\) :

\(Understand ""by the end of week #, i should be level #""\)

There is also exp gains depending on what place you get when you die, although not always. Example, there isn't an exp bonus for ranking 80th, but there is a bonus for ranking 8th. My next goal is to figure out which rank starts this bonus and how much exp per rank you get. You also get an exp bonus for winning, and I hope to figure that out as well at some point. Any help would be appreciated. Keep track of your exp before and after matches. Also keep track of survival time, excluding the fall timer at the beginning of the match and keep track of your kills as well.

Like many others, I bought the Battle Hound when it initially released and was very excited. However, after seeing the cape was not a separate back bling, I was a little disappointed but not to the point where I regretted purchasing the skin. The big issue with the skin now is that the cape interferes with EVERY other back bling that you try to equip on the Battle Hound. So after spending 2000 Vbucks on a skin, not only does it not have its own back bling (small problem), but you cannot equip another back bling onto it (big problem) without it looking stupid since the cape clips through whichever back bling. 

My ideal fix for this would be to have the cape have an on/off function. It could work like Carbide’s “Change Style” on the outfit selection screen. Where you can either use the cape or not, since Carbide has this option for his armor. This would then allow you to use another back bling on the Battle Hound. I don’t expect EPIC to allow the cape to be used on other skins since it has some details on the chest of Battle Hound. My dream scenario would be to re model the cape to take away the front parts of it so that it could act as a back bling for all skins, but that might be too much to ask.

If this post doesn’t get attention I’ll do a mock up of what I’m talking about in hope that it may get more traction.

TLDR; Battle Hound cape is broke, please fix!

It is know known that it will take 532,350xp to hit level 80 (which is level 85 from last season).  The issue comes with those that max tier their account on day one and the advantage that buying tiers gives them.  They receive the following xp benefits:

* Leveling from 1-80: 24,600xp
* 10 weekly challenges: 50,000xp
* 69 daily challenges: 34,500xp

This brings the total xp required down to 423,250xp, which is level 74 (and level 80 from last season).  So, buying max tiers from the start gives a 6 level advantage over others to unlock the last of the Omega set.

**Suggestion #1**: Set a date at which it's the earliest possible time to unlock tier 100, or just halfway though the season.  That would both reduce the paid advantage of xp gain and still allow those that max tier 100 later in the season the benefit of converting over to extra xp for later levels.

**Suggestion #2**: Revert the change back to battle stars.  If people want to pay for the battle pass, then pay to skip the entire leveling process, that's on them.  No extra rewards for doing so are needed.

**Suggestion #3**: The least likely, but remove the ability to buy tiers at the start of the season.  It should be an end of season catch up mechanic if things didn't go as planned, not a ""skip content"" option.  As I'm sure this is a huge money maker for Epic, I doubt something like this would happen to prioritize fair tier leveling over profit... but then again, looking at profit lines and quick money over fairness of gameplay has put the gaming industry in this nasty loot crate world we all have to deal with now.",FortNiteBR

Since it is forbidden to actually link stuff, I will just talk about certain things and not post any evidence regarding my points, but you can easily look that shit up.

Ninja used to stream H1Z1, a Battle Royal game like Fortnite, where he literally cursed and insulted other players multiple times (A lot of clips going around on Youtube/Twitch). I know that it was in the past and people can change, but not in his case. He is still raging and insulting people who kill him in Fortnite to this date. Most of the people, who kill him are his own viewers! (someone, who killed ninja uploaded a Youtube video regarding this in his own POV). Why am I even addressing all of this? Well, 2 days ago, he talked on stream about not wanting to appear with certain people on stream anymore, because they are ""cursing too much"". He was especially talking about TSM_Myth and Timthetatman, which are big names in the Fortnite community. I thought at first that he isn´t serious, but he actually was. He wants more ""friendly content"" since literally 90% of his fanbase are 10 year olds. Ironically enough, he is the most toxic guy out of all the top Fortnite streamers (A LOT of evidence can be found on Youtube). He just recently put up a fake persona, which he can not hold for too long, since his real persona comes through when he gets too upset ingame. (My thought on this is, that he is trying to avoid cooperating with them since they wont make him any bigger on Twitch plus they are not advertiser friendly in terms of expression.)

Didn´t really want to address this, but it illustrates the point quite well,  that he is putting up a fake persona for his audience: His humour is really cringey. I actually watched a couple of his old VODS from H1Z1 and PUBG, and his humour changed extremly. His humour wasnt anything special, but it was way more mature than what he does nowadays. He adapted his humour to be more ""Kids-friendly"". Making one bad joke after another. In this context this actually matters, since parents watching will think that this guy is airing kids-friendly content.

Actually, there are some fans, that are more mature and they are addressing this. But its just a minority, which gets soaked up by the majority of 10 year olds, who follow their ""leader"" blindly. The same case occured when Logan Paul did his stuff in the Forest. The kids were all over it and liked the video until it got criticized by bigger names.

He is extremly greedy. I dont know what causes this since he has been hustling for 6 years to be in this position, but he values money and fame A LOT. Advertising shitty Amazon Prime to make more and more money, even though he makes atleast 1,5-2 million dollars a month. Just shows how much of a rat he is, in my opinion. But this is definetly the weakest point of mine, since it is completly fine to make as much as you want, but I just dont get it.

This list can be filled with even more information and evidence, but i literally just needed 10 minutes to write this down. Just goes to show, how much he can made accountable for and that he needs to be criticized for what he does since this has been going on for months and he isnt getting the backlash that he deserves. He is in such a positive light and thats okay, but I want that people realize, that he isnt that nice of a guy that he pretends he is.

There was two “teams” introduced this season. [the heroes](https://imgur.com/gallery/y5sCzQt) and [the villains](https://imgur.com/gallery/Uqz6EZh). Each team has a base of operations. The villains a have a missile silo  in the west near Snobby and the heroes have a mansion in the east most point of the map. People have speculated that there will be a capture the flag game mode between these locations.

The main point to note is the fact there is a massive missile in the missile silo (shocker, I know). Just why is there a massive missile? There would be no reason for it unless it launched. 

However, I think that this is actually a rocket used for launching things into space. There was a video datamined which showed a UFO launching from Earth and flying to Mars. New map?

The next big thing is the “comet”. I don’t think that this is a comet because it pulsates light. It is also reminiscent of a scene from the movie Godzilla. [this sums it up pretty well](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8gbeqf/godzilla_is_coming_to_fortnite_prove_me_wrong/?st=JGW7AAG7&amp;sh=e9466016). Another thing to note is that the reward from week 1 of the blockbuster challenge is titled “[the monster of moisty mire](https://imgur.com/gallery/y5sCzQt)”. 

Going off of a datamined image of the week 2 reward for blockbuster (it is the omega skin breaking out of the prison with the description being something along the lines of “I’m going to gather a team/my allies”) I think that the villains are going to hatch the “egg” and use it to destroy places on the map. This ties into the leak we got in season 3 that the map is going to be constantly changing. What if each week, 2 weeks or however long, the “monster” destroys somewhere and it gets rebuilt differently?

In conclusion, things are going to go down. There are so many possibilities and I just hope it gets executed well.",FortNiteBR

Due to the success of the videogame and the web application, an **update with new functionalities** was necessary to reflect the activity of all its users, as well as implement utilities to improve the user experience. After many hours of work, the 2.0 update was launched in April, and it has the following features:

##**[FortniteChests 2.0](http://www.fortnitechests.info)**

### INTERACTIVE MAPS
* Interactive map updated to **Season 4** including Loot Chests (455), Ammo Crates (208), and Vending Machines (54).
* **Fullscreen button** both on desktop and mobile to improve the user experience.
* Users can **report** a chest in case of being eliminated due to some update of the game, allowing me to remove it quickly.
* **Estimated travel path time**, with minimum time in case of flat terrain, or maximum time in case of the necessity to cross mountains. **[Demo](https://gfycat.com/UnderstatedYawningBushbaby)**
* **Heatmap** that represents the amount of loot chests in different areas and the most clicked markers. **[Image](https://imgur.com/a/n58vHwM)**
* **Challenges Map** with attached screenshots of the main points of interest, including weekly secrets, loot areas, and collectible items. 
 **[Image](https://i.imgur.com/utf6XSj.jpg)**

### WEAPONS
* Weapons list **sortable** by their statistics.

### GAMIFICATION
* Users can contribute sending screenshots, increasing their score and climbing a monthly **Leaderboard with the most active users**.
* User profile with his activity history. **[Image](https://i.imgur.com/GqvFr89.png)**

### PUBLIC API
* Public API including information regarding markers, screenshots, and weapons. **[Demo](https://gfycat.com/WickedLightheartedAsp)**


I'm working on improving the latencies, especially to users in the United States, I will change the server location soon and the application will have faster loading times.

**Contact &amp; Feedback**

I hope you all enjoy the new features, if you have any issue, question or suggestion you can contact me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FortniteChests).

Thank you.  
Soumyy ♥

I start to get better and better but I feel like I'm missing out on many occasions where I could win if I had some extra buttons. The ability to keep my thumb on the Analog Stick must be great and that's why I'm thinking to buy a new controller.

I play on PS4 and my question is, what is the best option? I know about Scuf, battle beaver, XBOX elite controller and the PS4 strike pack. Those controllers are really expensive, especially the XBOX elite controller, is that really worth the money?

Did someone use the ps4 strike pack and can tell me if it's a nice addition and how it compares to the more expensive options?

I’ve enjoyed this game since the earlier seasons, back when we dominated teams and individuals alike. However, since the last few months people just got gud and destroy me and my team before we’ve had a chance to fire back. 

This is becoming an almost daily occurrence, leading to a somewhat unenjoyable experience (luckily I have Overwatch). 

As I’m on PS4 is this due to the addition of PC crossplay? PC have massive advantages of mode switching, easily building 3x faster and so much more. 

Or is it just skilled peeps becoming gods and just ruining us? Sure, it’s possible. However after playing games for most of my life going from god to being constantly dominated in seconds within a few months it seems to be consistent with things other than “git gud again”. 

Is skill based matchmaking something that is sorely needed? 

Before anyone bothers saying git gud, I am very aware that some people may have surpassed my skill. However 90% of the lobby passing me while I have played pretty much every day seems a little too excessive to be just me playing badly - and lends me to believe that mouse/keyboard accuracy vs controller input creates a heavy advantage for the PC team. 

I want to start a discussion to see if others have experienced the same impact. This isn’t a git gud contest, just an open chat about levelling and crossplay.

It basically makes it so that the heavy shotgun is pretty pointless to use. I know that the heavy is better at medium range. When the heavy truly outperforms the pump, that range, you should be using a rifle instead. Either nerf the pump shotgun to do less damage than the heavy, or give the heavy one shot potential at the same range the pump has one shot.

The pump is a great gun all and all, but having that much damage while its supposed higher rarity underperforms in most situations compared to it is a bit weird.

I recently got my account taken over by someone and whoever took over my account used my lifetime refunds on the entire wasteland warrior set. They then purchased the legendary Valkyrie skin an emote and battle pass tiers. I wasn't too alarmed because usually there are systems in place to reverse these kinds of unauthorized transactions, so I submitted a ticket.

I got a response super quick and epic just needed a few more details until they could fix my issue. 30 minutes later my account was semi fixed. I had my wasteland warriors skin, pick axe and 2 of the 3 refunds added back to my account but no glider.

I then received an e mail telling me that they fixed everything but the glider because battle pass tiers cannot be refunded.

WHAT KIND OF BULLSHIT IS THAT? THIS IS A VIRTUAL GAME WITH VIRTUAL ITEMS HOW CAN THEY NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES THAT THEY WANT?

I am wondering if anyone else has had the same issue and what they did to fix it. I am not a child, I am not stupid, it wasn't my fault that my account was taken over by someone and all I want are my items back. Who is epic to decide which items I get back and which ones I don't? I e mailed support and made it clear that if this issue doesn't get fixed I will never give a dime to their company again. I don't have money to throw away and battle pass tiers are the most stupid thing in my personal opinion and I would never ever spend money on things I can earn for free. I already spent 950 v bucks to buy the battle pass in the first place and if I really wanted to buy those tiers I wouldn't have bought my original items in the first place. The wasteland warriors set came out extremely recently and the Valkyrie skin was on the shop yesterday. I put in a ticket as soon as I found out so its not like I am trying to scam their system or anything.

This is ridiculous and horrible in terms of business practices. I have yet to receive a response from epic support since I threatened to never give them another dime until this issue is fixed. Funny because they were responding to me extremely quickly before I said that to them.

TL;DR Account was taken over by someone, someone bought battle pass tiers and epic is telling me there is no way to refund battle pass tiers. Wondering if anyone else has had the same issue and what did you do to resolve it or was it never resolved.",FortNiteBR

No one should be allowed a free getaway card for building bad and recklessly. We had fall damage in the game since season 1 and it was a core mechanic that punished people for doing stuff that would resulted with them taking fall damage or death by fall. 

Idea: If they want to keep it should have a energy bar that only lets you glide (no sky diving for quick descending) for ten seconds and whether you use it for the full ten seconds or even a minute it will go on a 30 second cooldown to prevent  excessive use of the redeployment system. Bounce Pads were pretty much vaulted due to its excessive usage and the ""unfair"" capabilities it gave to those who found some but was replaced with a ability to give everyone basically immunity to fall damage and the power to glide across the map with more mobility than bounce pads could even provide. Battle Royale Games should be survival of the fittest and if you didn't come across gear that gives you an advantage against your opponent it ok because every game you play won't be the same.",FortNiteBR

I am writing to you to show my discontent about a change that was made to one of the cosmetic items that I purchased. I was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (commonly known as OCD) when I was 16 years old - which is why the reason I am writing to you about is very important to me and may not be to other people. I purchased the starter pack that came with the rogue agent outfit and catalyst back bling. This two cosmetic items both belonged to the Black Vector set and suddently I noticed that the catalyst back bling no longer does. This, because of my condition, makes it very hard for me to use that back bling with the elite agent outfit, a skin that belongs to the same set. And I bought the starter pack just for the back bling and to use it with the elite agent skin. Can anything be done about this situation?

This gig is unpaid, although we do get millions of page views per day and upwards of 200+ million per month. We understand that working for exposure sucks, but this is truly all we can offer. On the bright side, this does give you an opportunity to add experience to your resume or portfolio. For those of you interested in working in the graphic design field for a career, this additionally provides you with real-world experience.

The workload fluctuates depending on what is going on at the time but we're generally looking for people who can create new banner images, flair icons, event images, snoos, random graphics as needed, and on a larger scale, people who can help us long-term mock up a new design for the old.reddit.com version of this subreddit. 

REQUIREMENTS:  

* You must have a portfolio of previous work.  
* You must be willing to communicate with us via Discord.  
* You must be willing to reiterate and change your design to meet our desires.
* You must be willing to share source files (.psd, etc.) for your graphic designs so that we can make adjustments and retain a backup copy as necessary.  
* You must be able and willing to create your designs without much hand-holding or guidance on some occasions. This means that sometimes we will tell you exactly what we want, and sometimes you will have complete free reign over your designs (within reason).  

If you are interested in submitting a portfolio, please send a private message to /u/Snaacky. Feel free to also send me any questions or concerns you may have!

At the time of posting and writing this (6pm GMT, on the 9th November 2018) the Ghoul Trooper has not returned to the Store since last Fortnitemares in 2017. He would have been playing since then, to be able to have created his own account and bought it himself. As well as this, he has what is known as an 'OG' username, as it is just the word 'Cutie' and nothing else - no invisible characters etc. As well as this, [at 5:53 in the linked video](https://youtu.be/GxD3-q2071s?t=353), he literally says the words ""I'm new to this game"".. how can he be new, if he has an OG username and skin? That doesn't add up. 

The only logical conclusion from this, is that he bought the account is account sharing with someone else. Based on his flexing, I'd be willing to bet that he bought the account.

It all started with glider redeploy. Once Epic introduced that to the game they should of realized what they did. They divided the community into two sets of people (those who like redeploy and those who don’t). Now no matter what they decide given this mechanic a large group of individuals will be upset. All for the sake of testing.

Next it was the rocket damage through structures. Frankly I’m still waiting to see Epic post that mans pink slip because whoever thought of that idea couldn’t even balance a teeter totter. 

Lastly you get rid of arguably the best mode for arguably the worst. There have been dozens of posts (I know cause I had to sift through them) praising this game mode, and what do you do? You replace it with Disco 3 days later. The oversight that’s happening is astonishing especially considering you didn’t tell us your purpose for removing Blitz.

Now this isn’t a post saying “I’m going to quit if Epic doesn’t get their shit together”, it’s probably the opposite. I love playing this game and will probably continue to do so for a good while, but if I am to be frank. 

Epic is fucking up. ",FortNiteBR

They straight up used my images and my words, to the order of the information given. Here is my other post so you can compare to the first part of the video

I could post every screenshot of the video to show that he copied straight up my post but if you watch it, you can already see he even uses my same images to the point he also cropped my own photoshop work.

AND even went far away as copying the 'no importance characters' in the same order.

First of all, why do we have an aim assist? 
We have it because with a mouse you can aim faster and more consistent in close range fights and youre better at tracking peoples with your ARs.

But whats the point of giving us an Aim assist that does at least 50% of the work for us?

At the current state everyone who does not want to have a decreased chance in winning a fight has to abuse the aimassist (spamming L2 and do a bit of tracking). 

First Problem:
Aim assist eliminates the skillgap for aim. You can not get 100% consistent because the aim assist does his work the most time but not every time. Its not in your hand. And you can also can get completly shredded by a L2 spammer. 

Second Problem:
Every Console gamer that shreds a Pc Player gets hated:  ""he is nothing without his Aimbot. "", so every time a Console Player is Winning (eSport) there are doubts on how far he derseved this. 

So why dont just remove the Aim assist for everyone (for one week lol), let us get consistent with our thumbs and see how good we really are.

You could drop little Mexico or risky and still get in the game but have less problems overall.

There are 2 major negative things I have noticed with redeploy since nightmares has ended (couldn't really make a verdict when nightmares was a game mode)

&amp;#x200B;

1. Third and fourth partying is at an all time high. It's basically unfair and every fight. People hear shots from far away, and can get to that fight to third party with 4 ramps. You never get a chance to heal from a fight or end up getting shot in the back... almost every fight. Third partying will always be a thing, but it gets to the point where you cant even have a team v team fight. 
2. There is no negatives for building high weak structures in build fights. The amount of fights i got in last night where someone just spun a weak 1 x 1 to get ""high ground"" just to shoot a rocket down on me was insane. I mean i can spin a 1 x 1 pretty fast to get high ground back from those people but it seems everyone does that just to use an explosive. 
3. Build fights have become useless. You lose high ground you just fly away. You literally just waste mats in build fights not for no reason. You get in a good little build battle burn 600+ mats and then your opponent just gets to dip because he lost high ground. Follow fly to him and just do the same thing again... whats the point? 

I know they added redeploy to speed up the game, but never being able to recover from a fight before you are in the next fight is unfair. The game was about building now your just build for high ground and then chase the person to the next fight after the fly away. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe keep redeploy on for when you use balloons actually making balloons useful. There are plenty of ways to move around the map now we dont need redeploy (Spook cubes and lava spots, rifts, balloons, launch pads).

Starting off with what I think is the main reason and for the reason I am making this post is because people have started to build without any consequences, they just keep building as high as they can and want and if you shoot them down then guess what? They will safely glide down and still have a fighting chance with you as to before where they would probably die, this removes any strategy from building in most cases.
It also makes it difficult to get into build battles and when and you do and are about to kill the guy they just jump off and run away however I am guilty of that as well and the aftermath is that you probably have no mats left and are pissed at the fact that the guy just ran away without a launchpad or bouncer. This makes the game very frustrating, I am still enjoying the game but I think it would be better without glider redeploy.
Also don’t get me wrong in the fact this is not fun, it is fun when I am doing squads and messing about but when I wanna try hard and get some wins this really annoys me and for having fun with squads which where I mainly have fun with this feature there was this game mode called soaring 50’s which did exactly what every game does.
This is not a suggestion but rather a discussion as I want to know what other people think about this and I am sorry for the long post but I had to post it as I did not see many posts about this change although I could have missed them easily as I am not looking at this sub everyday.

In solos the possibility still exists somewhat(much more rng but possible). As far as Duos the likely hood of you being able to recover after a fight endgame is slim to none(example 12 people or so left). The surviving duo from that fight will more than likely be engaged by a third party almost instantly if not already and so on. The way end game is being played between the two have never been so different.

Ask yourself how many times did you play Soaring 50s? The few times I did, it was very casually laid back. Nothing about the mode made me say to myself wow that was so much fun. Now blitz on the other hand was much more enjoyable with mechanics that could've easily improved the main game. 

How about Making launch pads blue rarity&amp;increase drop rate once redeploy is removed if anything.

A.I.M was airdropped on the map but what whatever was carrying him dropped him at the wrong coordinates or something happened to the carrier vehicle.

A.I.M realizes that its at the wrong coordinates so it sets out to head to Barry the Bunker.

We the players will noticed A.I.M arrival to the island and wondering what it is so, we follow A.I.M to Barry the Bunker in Wailing Woods.

A.I.M will open or the bunker hatch will open for it and the secret base will finally be completed thus giving us access to Barry the Bunker from the hatch and from the 3 to 4 hidden pathways in Wailing Woods.

I believe week 8 loading screen will be a image capturing the rift butterfly event while loading screens 9 and 10 or at least one of them will be A.I.M related since there has allows been a loading screen dedicated to the ""Mystery Skin"" (exclude seasons 1-3 since they didn't have a ""Mystery Skin"" to be rewarded with for completing all 7 week challenges)",FortNiteBR

I hit a rift and go to the mansion, and farm some trees  I have like 300 mats.

This guy lands on top of my house and I go to push him but I realize I probably won't win the fight and I go back into the house to farm. 

I farm the entire inside of the house out and get to like 700 mats.

It's the top 5, I go to fight the next guy and he starts building infinitely into the sky, I lose like 300 mats and then back off because I want to conserve them and he quickly flies away to fight the other people. I quickly farm up another 200 or so mats as the last 2 guys fight and then it's just me and the other guy.

He's on top of a build fight in the middle of the circle.

I do covered ramps trying to push him but he pulls out a quad launcher and starts shredding me.

0 mats.

The whole game where I wasn't running from the storm, I was farming, yet it felt like I never had as many mats as anyone else I was trying to fight.

Where are they getting their infinite mats from?

But is it just me, or does this really change one of the MAIN dynamics that makes Fortnite, Fortnite? I mean building is the difference maker, but you always had the threat of fall damage so you couldn't be too silly. Now there is just literally ramps everywhere. End game you'll be fighting, and 2 other squads fly in out of nowhere. I get they're trying to speed the game up, but with rifts, rift 2 go's, ATK's, Quads etc, is it really necessary?

1) you cant recommend yourself

2) all recommendations must be from accounts older than 1 week old

3) if you PM me asking for the damn skin, you will not get it. 

I tried selling the skin, and there are lots of people who like to use 'my kid is so sad without this'll to try and get one. Hence, free give away instead.

I know for a fact it is not my microphone. I can start a PS party chat while my mic isn't ""working"" in FN and I can talk/hear normally. The only problem with doing that workaround is I play with a buddy on Xbox and he cannot join a PS chat party. So it forces me to miss the action for one game and then spend 5 minutes reloading the game up after the match is over.

If you’re someone who can only get a couple eliminations per game against someone who gets double digit kills, it’s not going to be as fun for the less-skilled folks. 

The customization edits you made to playground mode are amazing. If you can allow customizations for regular modes for some sort of skill matchmaking options so that players can choose to play against other players at their skill level or harder, this would make the game more fun and fair. 

A suggestion is to create an toggle-able (on/off) option that allows people to choose whether they want to be put in to a regular match made game like how matchmaking is currently done, or if they want to get matched up into a game against other players of the same K/D ratio (or other metric), it would be very helpful so that way the people who are used to only get a couple kills aren’t facing off against the really skilled players who get 16, 17, and beyond, kills.

Which some people might consider rare but honestly those skins aren't good looking.  But what if, Epic could add something where say after you get a certain amount of kills (or wins) you get an item, not a skin but maybe a backbling, or this isn't in the game but could be a cool addition, what if they added patches or maybe pins.  The pin could go on your shirt and it could say how many kills you got to unlock that.  Or it could be maybe more iconic like a Fortnite related icon.  But for backblings it could be maybe a shield or anything epic wants.  That way when you see a ""no-skin"" it might not instantly make you think ""easy win.""  I don't know a super good way to implement this but the idea is here and do what you want with it.

Season 5 was really bad, I agree, but things have surely improved since then. Game is extremely enjoyable right now, some items are unnecessary, but the game is in a great state at the moment.

If you get burned out, take a break. If you still don't enjoy, just stop playing.

Something hurts a wall? Nerf it.

Something still hurts a wall a little bit? Vault it.

You scream and moan about anything that adds at least a bit of variety in this game, instead of having it to be buildspam and building only. Despite the fact that good builders still came up on top on literally any stage of the game, including post buff c4's and pre nerf planes. God forbid we have a little bit of unpredictability in an arcade, child friendly BR that was obviously supposed to be super casual before you tainted it. 

People who are sick of this shit leaves in droves. People who do not like your precious BUIDLDSPAM AND PUMP only leaves as well. People who do not like the building, but truly appreciates everything else this game has to offer, such as arcade'ish gameplay, fast paced action, general silliness and wonderful artstyle, instead of generic muh military shit, still gets shat on and told that it's only building that matters.

Ideas for an optional DIFFERENT game mode (can't go further with it, because I am 100% sure the bot picks it up and removes it immediately when you mention it) that deviates from this gets downvoted to hell and anyone who suggests this gets publically mocked, because the mere idea of people enjoying different thing is like a plague to you. Something that would take pretty much no effort to add and would attract more players and satisfy the players who prefers different thing is somehow BAD.

I honestly wish for a competitive mode with nothing but build and pump, so you drones will have no excuses to be against fun stuff to be added to this game, instead of it being a 100% sweatfest, with anything that takes at least a small step away from this getting publically screeched away and vaulted by hysterical drone mentality here, from streamers and ""pros"". 

I mean, yes. Screw casuals. Screw what made the game explode in the first place, being a fun, fast, light hearted BR that got turned into pseudo competitive hellhole, no new player will stick around for, after experiencing getting buried over freshly erected new york city every time they as much as sneeze into someone's direction.

Ebin downboats to the left,  my precious plebbit hivemind, but keep in mind, no matter how many times you will press it, your manhood will not get bigger. ",FortNiteBR

My gf got into Fortnite and now we want to play together so she plays on Switch and I on pc.
But since I'm more used to playing with a controller than mouse and keyboard I recently got a Xbox controller for pc. 

The second reason I bought the controller was because because of me my console playing friends got also put with pc players and they found it less fun playing squads with me because everyone is just so good. 

I had hoped that since I use a controller now, we'd be put with other controller users which doesn't seem to be the case.

So I come here to say that the game is in a very split state right now. As the casuals go away because lobbies run wild with the so to speak try hards, lobbies become extremely hard for the casual community. 

EXPLANATION: 

[GROUP 1] Now first of all I do not blame people for trying hard to become better because people find that fun and that’s what they like to strive for. Every game progresses and there will always be the try hards for any game and it’s because they love it and want to become the best they can be. They set goals and find it fun to get sweaty. It is only right for a game to have the try hards because in every game the players evolve.

[GROUP 2] As for the casuals who play for fun, the lobbies have become quiet difficult and not as fun because we have the try hard we’ll doing what they do. And there is nothing wrong with that at all. Everyone has fun in their own way but their fun just makes it harder for the casuals. The casuals play for the thrill, the jokes, silly moments, the experience fortnite brings but with the clash between the two types of player has really killed the casual play for gamers. With the pros pushing for the game to their liking and with the implementation of the new pop up cups it only makes the game much harder. Now for my solution that every can agree on and has talked about is ranked and casual.

SOLUTION: Now this all comes down to epic and how they handle it at headquarters but the outcry for a ranked had been absurd and ridiculous how they have no clue on how badly it is needed. With the casual gamers dying down as the days pass epic is only pushing them away by not listening to their community (both groups). So if there were a ranked mode with different rankings you can be placed in similar to rainbow six siege example: copper, silver gold, platinum, and diamond. that would give the desired placement future to the try hards and a reward somewhat to know where they are at. The ranked mode would have the pop up cups settings such as Mats and HP per kill and mats cap at 500. This would then open the door up to the casual game modes, bringing back the old features and leaving it how it was before, AND also making it possible for epic being able to add their silly items and also testing them before they should be added to the ranked mode. I personally like epics creativity with items although they may be annoying at times I cannot blame them for trying to make their game fun and unique. All I’m saying epic is make a RANKED. 

If you made it this far thank you for your time! ",FortNiteBR

It’s not just bad though, but actually is exceedingly dangerous to all the children and young adults that place this game. 

If you have played this game for more than 5 minutes you’ll learn that to hear the useful sounds over the noise pollution in game (looking at you fireworks and gliders, footsteps over gunfire) you need to turn the volume up high, so high that given prolonged exposure you can damage the portion of your ear responsible for hearing. With prolonged exposure there is risk of hearing loss and tinnitus (ringing sound that can be constant or comes and goes), but you won’t notice these things until years following.

Think of the millions of children and young adults who spend countless hours in this game, many of whom will go on to develop hearing loss as a result of a system that rewards damaging your body for short term gain in game. EPIC, through their poorly made sound system and lack of effort to adequately balance sounds following community outcry shares a large part in the blame here. 

Something needs to be done. An overhaul is needed to make the useful noises in game much louder than the filler noise. That way people can hear what they need to without cranking their volume to max; in the hopes that they won’t get snuck up on while farming or firing. EPIC needs to take responsibility here for the harm they are causing consumers and at the very least fix this pressing issue!",FortNiteBR

I never got into video games. I know some stuff because my brother is a gamer. But it never interested me.

This season I tried really, really freaking hard and unlocked tier 100 about 20 minutes ago. I am super proud of myself, last season I only managed to get in the 60s.

However, fortnite is completely different to any other battle royale game, due to the building mechanics. Ive played since season 1 and I can personally say Im at an all time low in terms of enjoyment with fortnite right now. I've played since season 1, but casually, not attempting to get any better and just playing for fun more than anything. There is nothing more frustrating that being jumped on, getting into a build battle and dying to someone who lives and breathes fortnite. It may be fun for them, but as a casual who just wants to hop on, have a few relaxed, chilled out games with some friends, it just gets boring after a while and I know it's driving me and a lot of my friends away from the game as its become too competitive. At least with a ranked ladder system we'd be matched with people of our skill level so it wouldn't be as try hard all the time. Just think back to early seasons when hiding in bushes was a genuine tactic and people spent more time shooting at other people instead of it being a battle of who has the most mats. I understand fortnite has evolved and people are better now, but I just miss the old days where people had gun fights relying on accuracy instead of build battles relying on mats and spam building. If this carries on, I personally cant see myself playing fortnite much longer, which is a shame because I've really enjoyed playing the last 18 months. ",FortNiteBR

I don't know if this is real or fake, so don't get your hopes up. I thought I should share this info about Season 8 because it's interesting nonetheless.

So basically, Season 8 will start off with a massive earthquake, destroying Wailing Woods and turning it into Wailing Wasteland and adding a large volcano in the middle. Some existing locations like Tilted Towers, Polar Peak, and Junk Junction will be split in half by cracks. All of the cracks will open into ravines containing lava. Over the season, there will be more map changes and more sounds coming from the volcano. In the middle of the season, there will be a small ""eruption"" event, leading to a one week period (like Fortnitemares) where small parts of the map will be covered in lava. There aren't going to be any ""zombies"" again, but instead, there will be eruptions. The volcano will erupt a few times each game, making the ground shake while damaging lava falls onto random spots of the map. These earthquakes will continue to become more intense, leading up to a major ""tsunami"" event. The volcano will shake violently, causing a large tsunami to crash into the island, covering the whole island in water for a few seconds until retracting back into the ocean. Wailing Wasteland and the area surrounding it will become a wet area known as Sharky Shrubs. It won't be completely covered in water, but there still will be some water. The cracks around the map will no longer contain lava and slowly begin to be filled in (similar to the craters). The volcano will become a regular mountain, and balance will be restored. The secret ""Eruption"" skin will be almost like a ""Water King"" and will lead into Season 9's story. A motorcycle vehicle will be added and will be available across the map. Driftboards and Planes will be vaulted. I don't know much about the Battle Pass other than that it will contain unlockable Lobby Backgrounds. Save The World will have a revamped hero system and Twine Peaks will have a storyline. As for Creative, there will be new prefabs and devices such as the Cube and cube/ice monster spawners.

Big map changes, I'm so bored with the current map and I started in s5 I can't imagine how ogs feel

Ranked
New players can't even get kills nowadays. I started when casuals still played but nowadays it's like 90 sweats against 8 noobs and 2 afks 

More (better) challenges
Challenges that are harder than battle pass weeks but not as Grindy as ice storm challenges. The share the love challenges are not convenient if you have no friends still grinding fortnite and I think the 14 days of fortnite are a great example of how they should work. Completing a week of challenges should give us an item, backblings, gliders, harvesting tools, sprays. Good stuff

Balance
They need to fix the way some guns work. Bloom is very high on some assault rifles and even with a heavy only 3 of the 30 you shoot will actually hit. Some guns do too much damage and some don't do enough ( I'm looking at you pistols)

SUPPORT 
Email me back epic. I've been getting ghosted about not receiving my S5 umbrella for so long and always get a cut and paste response when I ask again


In conclusion the game needs to be changed severely to keep players. A lot of the map feels boring and some lot look really bad. The only pretty looking location I can think of is lucky landing. A clear theme throughout and nothing looks the same as other map locations

The comment, which is old and remains unedited since posting, has gotten many details regarding Season 7 correct which gives some validity to it.



&gt;**Season 7:** ""With winter coming that means snow. There will be an iceberg that brings some creatures and also a festive look to the map (snow). There will be more snow slowly added from the initial season update.

&gt;**Season 8:** Throughout season 7 the iceberg will slowly melt.  Towards the end it will reveal a creature (octopus, kraken, etc.). In the end of season 7 the iceberg will disappear and islands will rise up in their place.  Boats/pirate ships will be added for transportation.  The battle pass will be Pirate/Sea Monster themed.

&gt;**VAULTS AND CHANGES**

&gt;- Grappler will be changed to an old fashioned throwable hook and rope. (Unlimited uses, small range)
&gt;- Miniguns and SMG's will be vaulted along with planes and turrets. 3.There will be flintlock pistols and cannon ball launchers. (They will break through buildings. It is in STW right now.)",FortNiteBR

People will complain that fortnite was better before the battle pass was free for everyone. 


People will say (whatever game here) is killing fortnite 

People will stomp and scream and say they’re quitting but still play the game loyally and hate on the game daily in this sub. 

Some new gun / thing will replace why the game isn’t as good as season 3

The new sweat skin will be whatever level 1 skin for season 8 is.


**A lot of people will actually enjoy it and have fun with it but you won’t be able to tell by the posts in this sub. **

I’m already tired of seeing people complain about season 8 or people complain in general. 

People won’t be able to adapt to the changes in fortnite and call it trash.

Planes are going,  but they were whined and bitched about from the get go. Ironically enough, had the game not touched the turrets, they would have been strong enough to combat the planes easily. But sure enough, epic answers to this subreddit, and it effected how we go about combatting planes for the majority of the season. If only we hadn’t nerfed the turret into the ground. 

Case in point, if there’s an item introduced or an item vaulted, it’s more likely than not there’s a reason for it down the road. Let’s let epic do their thing for a bit.

Now forget about that what I'm looking for is someone nice that won't make fun of me for being bad and can carry me sometimes till I start being the one to carry, but mostly play for fun and have a good sense of humor.

Note: I prefer if you have a good clear mic.

I'm a 15 y/o boy, I'm NOT toxic at all, I've already finished 99% of challenges so don't msg me to do some of them except in season 8 of course when I'll get my first battle pass, I've been playing since the end of season 5, I've known the game before it had the battle royale mode and was a fan since but couldn't play as I didn't have a PC yet and I have proof (Vanoss Banner)

A solution would be to only give a health bonus when downed players bleed out or are eliminated by an opposing team. This would incentivize leaving downed players alive while continuing a fight. If a player immediately needs mats, guns, or ammo, they can sacrifice the health bonus &amp; eliminate the downed player.

Here are me and my freinds suggestions to revive you guys.

The banner revive feature - could stop thirsting

If if your squad is fighting another squad and you get thirsted they wont get the sheild and you would need to kill the entire squad

The droftboard should be permanent 

Remove the planes (or just the shooting and they could be used for rotation from the storm)

The planes breake in end game removing campers that camp on planes

Durr burgur consumeble - this will give you imunity to the storm for 10 seconds

And thats all you can adjust them in any way to fit the game",FortNiteBR

Maybe it wasn't as balanced or ""enjoyable"" as Season 2 and 3 but you can't deny the amount of effort Epic has put into this season.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 7 introduced the originally hated Ziplines and the even more hated Planes. Now they're kinda just... there. However, these are prime examples of the complexity, creativity and quality of Epic's work and I'm excited for what's next (I'm calling boats because of the pirate theme and the earthquakes that cause the island to crack and separate into different pieces, revealing parts of the ocean.

 

Season 7 was also probably the season with the most freebies. Apart from the free pass, which contained a few goodies already, the 14 Days of Fortnite challenges, along with the Ice Storm and the Overtime challenges provided players (both spenders and defaults), a chance to get decent stuff. The Merry Munchkin, Disco wrap, Blue Metallic wrap, Winter's thorn glider, along with a FREE Season 8 Battle Pass were just some of the free rewards available, a significant increase from previous seasons.

&amp;#x200B;

Global events. Some were awesome. Some, not so much. The Marshmello event was AWESOME (tOp 10 mOsT AmBiTiOuS cRosSovErs), one of the biggest virtual events to date and really brought the spotlight back on Fortnite. The Ice King event, though hyped up, was a little disappointing, not terrible or anything but didn't match up to the Rocket of season 4 or the Cube one of Season 6. Alas, not everything can be perfect, I'm sure we all appreciate Epic for at least *trying* to make the event as good as its predecessors. Marshmello event though, that was great.

&amp;#x200B;

Wraps. Pretty cool little mechanic, Season 4 introduced selectable styles for skins, Season 5 (I'm not too sure tbh so I'll just leave an awkward blank here, Season 6 introduced pets (which people barely use anyways so let's forget about those). But geez finally, weapon wraps! A long requested feature, most of them are pretty cool and really just complete any cosmetic set.

&amp;#x200B;

Also Epic please add more goofy and funny emotes instead of actual dance moves unless they are iconic or something (not too iconic, we don't want anymore copyright cases). I mean Slick was pretty good, but where are the ""Best Mates"" or ""Take the L"" level emotes? We want more of them!

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I'm really pumped for Season 8. Really, the start and ends of Seasons are the best part of every season, be it a closure to a storyline, or a beginning to another one. All we know is that a season reset brings a long a fresh load of new content, skins, ~~bugs~~ and much more.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a good rest of your day and thank you for reading!

1.  The only ""Pump + Something"" meta, back in Season 5/6 i could use Pump, Heavy or Double Barrel + something what was kinda cool, having to avoid Double Barrel from my enemies or choose between a big strong punch on the enemy's mouth with the Pump or a focused kick on the stomach with Heavy, having options is awesome, but now the game is: ""green pump -&gt; change to a legendary/epic pump in the mid game and it's over"" because there's no other viable options for close combat (the majority of combats) making the game be a hella boring in a long run...

&gt;My suggestion to solve this is: bring back a ""reworked"" version of Heavy Shotgun, here's my post about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aayubb/a_new_utility_for_heavy_shotgun_judging_by_the/?utm_source=reddit-android, buff the Tactical Shotgun to make it more consistent, that shotgun in the current state isn't viable, i think increasing the minimum damage to 50 would be awesome, bring back Drum Gun dealing less damage on building (something like 19) and with a longer reload and reduce the quantity of Pumps... Now is:

+Green Pump - 95/190 damage

+Blue Pump - 100/200 damage

+Purple Pump - 105/210 damage

+Gold Pump - 110/220 damage

I think this would be better:

+Green Pump - 90/180 damage

+Blue Pump - 95/190 damage

+Gold Pump - 100/200 damage


2. People boxing themselves is such a strong strategy and the actual counters for this put the dude trying to kill the ""boxed"" player in a huge disavantage or isn't strong enough (RPG, Stinky Granades and trying to brake through the structures).

&gt;My suggestion for this is: lower the turbo build delay to something between the actual (buffed) delay and the last delay (before the buff) to make more SMG bullets pass through the structures or make easy to the guy in the outside replace one of the structures.

3. We are playing in the same map for like 1/2 years, i think this game needs one more map.",FortNiteBR

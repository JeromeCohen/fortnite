I am a player that started playing playing a week before tilted came out during season 2, and even though people say season 3 or 4 was the peak of Fortnite, this ain't it chief. The game feels fast, with a fun early, mid and late game experience. The guns, traps, POI's, players and game is overall much better than before. This all culminates to be the best Fortnite yet. For many players, the game is getting boring, but the way Epic adds new content revitalizes my passion for this game. Here are a few examples.

EPIC GAMES: Epic games is perhaps my favorite game developer since when I played league during season 4. After playing games like battlefront I have really felt like this company cares about the community with things like removing the minigun from wild west 15 minutes after release. This company is nuts and great for the game.

Cross platform: Cross platform play in this game is the biggest thing about it. This leads to everything, from my friends in my squad all playing different ways. I got my mouse, he has his phone, she has her PS4 and my dogs on the Xbox. You used to never have PS4 and Xbox together but hey, look at the new day. The game has United consoles and every way to play for the best experience ever.

Game modes: Not many games have new content weekly, especially not new game modes full of new things such as solid gold and soaring 50's. Playing all these different ways with new play styles really adds to the game and gives good and bad players a chance to thrive. The weekly+ tournaments are insane and give the sweaty tryhards a place to sweat and play like a pro. This makes the game new, without changing the game entirely.

Weapons: Ohh man the guns. With the new shotgun changes I feel as if the game is fast and fun. ARs have always been so reliable, with each having unique abilities such as scopes, thermal scopes, 98 headshots and burst capabilities. Shotguns feel better, with each having a specific purpose. SMGs are not broken nor bad anymore since they are a reliable decent gun. Snipers are amazing with each snipers being unique and fun. Even splodes are fun and fair, with more players learning to build they feel more counterable then back in season 3. Even pistols are fun, such as the deagle and hey, some guns need to be bad for others to be good.

Utilities: Traps, builds, consumables and all of this is what makes Fortnite unique. The way one can build and fight makes it so much fun. The mat cap is still high and farming is fairly easy and not even that boring so the game feels rewarding. Traps are fun, with chillers being an easy escape tool or attack tool, launch pads being good for high ground, storm or escaping. Even the turret, the stupid damn turret got nerfed to the ground. Consumables are great as well and each stackable is unique and better in some scenario. 

Vehicles: There was a time before shopping carts, atk's, cars, rifts, balloons, shadow stones, grapplers, and chillers when people who landed in the middle of nowhere would die to the zone no question. The way Epic has added vehicles allows for many playstyles so anywhere you land can be a safe drop. All these mobility items allow for finding more kills, escaping zone and having more fun in the game.

POI's: The game has evolved, that isn't a question. Under 50% of the named locations from season one are still in the map, with huge changes to loot lake and moisty still impacting the game. The addition of multiple great drops makes the game different every time you drop in. You will never, EVER, play the exact same game with the same zone, same loot, same skilled people and same place. The game is so different everywhere there is always something new to see in the game, which is why it dominates other games and previous versions of Fortnite. Thanks for reading it all.

TL;DR: The game is better than ever. The way Epic has made cross platform work, the way they added new game modes, guns, utilities, vehicles and mobility devices to make the game better is revolutionary. And the game won't just stop here. Hey people sorting by new!

&amp;#x200B;

We all know how hard it is to get items. Some are restricted by battle passes, others are simply sponsors (e.g. Galaxy, GeForce...). This is the reason why so many people are getting s.-cammed by fishing websites: s.-cammers will attempt to get a.-ccounts with an inventory featuring specific unaccessible skins.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic games simply shot their own foot at this point. By restricting our inventory so much, they created a market of stolen a.-ccounts without their will. So the idea is to bring a t.-rading system BUT with a simple feature that obligates us to buy a ""wrap"" or something like that. In other words, everytime you want to t.-rade with someone or give a locker item to your friend, you'll have to pay with a few v-bucks, let's say 950 vbucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Why? Because Epic games wants profit. This is appealing to them, they get the money they want, and we are able to t.-rade the s.-kins, battle pass or not, we want without giving s.-cammers the chance to create some fishy g.-ambling websites like it became for a few steam games.  


Let's forget about sponsor skins since there's no way they will be able to be t.-raded obviously.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think about this alternative? I think it will be able to both reduce the ammount of stolen a.-ccounts, give Epic the profit they want and giving us the possibility to t.-rade with our friends and family...",FortNiteBR

I fully expect people to downvote and say I’m trash, but even being on the giving end of a trap kill is annoying. Is it a good, cool play? For sure. Is it fair that you can just trap up a room and stand still in it and not take damage? Maybe not so much. I’d like to see it tested at least. ",FortNiteBR

In my eyes, supply drops are not valuable enough for anyone to contest them. When comparing to PUBG for example I think that fortnite is lacking, in PUBG supply drops feel really important and are almost always fought for by at least two teams. That is because the weapons or gear you get from them makes gameplay different, it kind of breaks of from usual load outs. So that brings me to my suggestion:

#Supply drops should have a separate loot pool that would not overlap with chests or floor drops.

Why this would be better than the current situation: 

1. Supply drops become a mid game hot-spot and is a fun feature for all.

Currently mid game rotations are a bit lacking and kind of random, as in it is a bit difficult to predict where people will go and sometimes it's impossible to cut of someone rotating (rifts, launch pads). Air drops placed at random locations in zone for everyone to fight over would make the game plan a bit more predictable almost like team fights over drake in league. The good players would move in closer to them for a large team fight with multiple people and the casuals would move away.

2. Looting becomes less RNG based.

Now this is open for debate and I'll explain how I would change it, however some might not agree with it. Feel free to leave suggestions below. 

Here is what imo should be solely in supply drops:

All heavy versions of weapons (not sure how to deal with epic rarity)

Double barrel

Golden pump

P90

All explosives

I chose these not because I hate playing against them, but because they change gameplay compared to normal setups in some crucial way. Be it dps and clip size, range or even how you approach fights.

3. Great for competitive, multiple teams fighting for a major advantage in late game.

We all know that comp gameplay is a lot slower compared to pubs (which is completely normal) but epic doesn't like that. Mid game usually ends up being very lackluster and elims pile up at the end. Supply drops giving players advantages over others would be important enough to fight over, which would make the elims curve out a bit better and reducing the massive spike at end game.

4. Getting the rare weapons would keep casual players entertained.

Kind of self explanatory, finding a rocket launcher would become a much more exciting experience for less skilled players. Therefore it would keep them playing for more hoping to try it again (not a key point, just thought I would mention it)

That's all I could come up with, if you have anything positive (OR NEGATIVE) to add please do.

Let’s get right into it with the battlepass. I can say almost for certain it will be 100 tiers. Hard to say what any of the skins may be but I along with the rest of the community have a few theories. The first major theory is that the female counterpart to the Beef Boss the Durr Burger skin A.K.A. “Onesie” May be coming in the battlepass. This makes sense seeing as it was in the files and eventually was taken out and in the season 6 battle pass we got the female counterpart to the Tomatohead skin. Seems like they could keep the trend. Second theory is that somewhere in the Battlepass will be a Santa skin. No real evidence aside from Christmas coming up to support a possible Santa skin but it does seem like a good candidate for a upgradeable skin. 

Also in the battlepass I would like to talk about music packs. I can say almost for sure there will be a Christmas theme music pack. I also have my hopes up for a legitimate OG music pack and not some retarded remix. Don’t have much else to say here so onwards.

Only known map change is there will be more snow coming to the map. As far as I’m concerned it could be the entire map getting snowed over (don’t know how that would work in the desert area but we’ll see) or just a biome like the desert back at the beginning of season 5. Considering where the “ice cloud/storm” that can be seen is aligned to run into the bottom of the map that is where it is most likely to be created. We could also see something potentially advancing the Durr Burger vs Tomatohead plot but we’re unsure of anything though there does seem to be an event in the files labeled “Durr Burger event” or something.

For weapons, like the start of season 6 we could potentially see multiple things getting vaulted. My bets would be on the Famas, (purple and gold burst) the double barrel shotgun, and potentially the minigun. I really hope they keep the minigun but we’ll see.

If you have anything else to add please say so in the comment section.",FortNiteBR

If I grab a blue tac and my opponent has a green pump, I’m still screwed. Let’s face it... there’s not many trash kids anymore that can’t headshot with a pump. The headshot multiplier on the tac could also be buffed a bit and lower the base damage. Idk.. just a thought.

with that said, here is some more info

-i have seen video of talented players so i do know some basic stragedy

-i know some basic controls and how to do most things (not super technical with building)

-i play regular hand position (not claw) -- tried for like 1 minute,

-i can build somewhat, not a pro but i can and do build

-i know which guns colors are more rare etc...

-sensitivity is around 7 for settings

Basically, my biggest problem is aiming...

do you have a specific gun that is a best for beginners?
do you always zoom in when you shoot? or does it vary with gun

what helps you aim or is it just a natural things with practice? (i sometimes practice before the match) and i know snipers you may have to aim higher

The pool by the indoor soccer stadium, the motel, the lab in dusty divot, (maybe the remains of dusty depot), the villain base, the building in tilted towers, that one house in pleasant park, a bunch of houses in retail row, etc. there’s so much potential in these broken down buildings and so much cleanup that could be done that their could practically be half a season on it. There should be construction crews and cleanup crews at these areas tearing them down and then building something else. The villain base could be an observatory to further space travel and make something for season 8. The dusty divot lab could be devoted to a weapon testing facility, or could be linked with the portals to the wailing woods lab to know more of teleportation. The pool in the indoor area could be fixed up and filled. The houses that are broken could be fixed. The once durr burger area could be tender town. Tomato temple could be a joining of tomato and burger. The building in tilted could be a museum with parts from the past.

King Richard called me a sweat and a try hard the entire time will I was just memeing around. He acts like this is some crazy win against me when I basically handed it to him. Overall he had a great game but the title of the video specifically targets me; because of the end game fight.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why I am making this post is because he cuts the video before he called me trash (Proof [https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantBrainyKimchiThisIsSparta](https://clips.twitch.tv/IgnorantBrainyKimchiThisIsSparta)) Just crazy how a pro player can be so toxic towards a random person.

I started playing the normal/casual scrims about a month ago and since then I have improved a lot and now I’m winning a scrim a day on average.

I wanted to challenge myself so me and my friend decided to  try the league system out just to see what it was like. 

On our first game we had a really good start and lasted till late game. However, when I killed a few scrimmers I noticed people joining my stream (yes, ttv btw) and being extremely toxic. Without going into too much detail these guys were constantly swearing and insulting me and my friend by calling us ‘bots’, quite frankly this made us laugh more than it made us mad. However, someone younger could of taken offence and in the worse case scenario stop streaming altogether which is darn harsh.

To conclude, I hate toxic scrimmers and do something better with your life :)",FortNiteBR

In most other games when this kind of action happens you contact customer service and they’ll usually refund you/ swap for the intended purchase. Epic has their self service refund system for Fortnite. I’ve already used my three tickets due to other accidents or just not liking a skin I bought. 

I sent an email to customer service and got an automatic response because I had the word “refund” in my email. 

Ok, whatever. I typed up another email using different phrasing, basically asking if I could swap out my Taro for Nara (it was still in the shop at this time). I have yet to receive any kind of email back from their support.

Epic, PLEASE implement a secondary confirmation for the shop, or at least be supportive of those of us who are super clumsy and prone to accidents. I personally think receiving one refund ticket per season would be a good solution to this.

Tl;dr Epic please fix the self service refund system.",FortNiteBR

While not completely removing shields from everybody, it would prioritize health and not be a complete redo like the slurp, just a 25 how health boost. It would make the game feel more rewarding and since there are more ways to take HP damage now,( i.e storm, fall damage, Quad Crasher, stink grenades.) It would be a nice way to prioritize health.

My question is, is there a way to do that without him having to converse with all the other players in the game.

This is a breakdown of all the ways to earn battle stars or tiers. If you would like specific help with your level, how many challenges you have/haven't done then comment below.

##Levelling Up

There's a total of **100 levels** that can be attained in Fortnite. Each level gives 2 Battle Stars with the exception of every 5th level giving 5 Battle Stars and every 10th level giving 10 Battle Stars.

* 100 Battle Stars for every 10th level
* 50 Battle Stars for every 5th level
* ~160 Stars for the 80 levels in-between
* 310 Battle Stars or **31 tiers**

As a rough guide, you get ~31 Battle Stars or **3 tiers** for every 10 levels (*level 20 to 30 for example*) so you can take your current level and calculate how many tiers you could potentially get.

##Weekly Challenges

There's a total of 10 weeks worth of challenges at 50 Battle Stars per week and a bonus **5 tiers** that can be attained

* 500 Battle Stars or **50 tiers** total
* 50 bonus Battle Stars or **5 bonus tiers**
* 65,000 XP from completing 4/7 challenges each week

The 65,000 XP you get from completing 4/7 challenges each week is worth a different amount of tiers depending on what level you already are, for example it's equal to going from level 1 to level 33 which is *approximately 9 tiers*

##Daily Challenges

Since it's almost the end of the season, it's unlikely that anyone grinding will get much use out of daily challenges. You get 1/2 a tier per day essentially so take how many days are left in the season, half it and that's roughly how many tiers you can get from daily challenges.

* 1/2 a tier per challenge is equal to 350 Battle Stars or **35 tiers** for the whole season (*70 days*)
* 500 XP per challenge is equal to 35,000 XP for the whole season (*70 days*)

The 35,000 XP you get from completing daily challenges is worth a different amount of tiers depending on what level you already are, for example it's equal to going from level 1 to level 25 which is *approximately 7.5 tiers*

##Buying Tiers / V-Buck Rewards

Realistically if you start very late in the season, it's either literally impossible to get tier 100 or it's incredibly unlikely. A lot of people will either decide not to bother or will be okay with buying the remaining tiers. If you're starting late then and haven't bought it yet perhaps buying the 25 tier bundle will be your best option however if you have bought it, you may need to buy tiers.

* You get 100 V-Bucks at levels 4, 11, 27, 34, 35, 42, 52, 58, 70, 75, 85, 91, 97
* You get 200 V-Bucks on level 18 which is a total of **1,500 V-Bucks**

Based on weekly challenge completion alone I estimate you could net a return of at least 700 V-Bucks which this season could translate to buying one 10 tier bundle at 600 V-Bucks or roughly 5 tiers buying them individually.

##Conclusion

If you were to play at the start of the season you could get to tier 100 simply by completing all of the daily and weekly challenges whilst also attaining approximately level 32 which you would attain simply from weekly challenge XP alone.

If you're starting late, you will be heavily limited by how much time you have to play. If you can do it, focus on completing challenges as doing the weekly challenges will net you tier 55 minimum and then add in however many daily challenges you can get.",FortNiteBR

I'm not making this post cos I'm salty or anything but it was just a thought I had when commenting on someone getting the Korean exclusive skin.

Having worked in retail, I thought why there wasn’t a Noms Skin, so I drew this up. 

•Overtime Skin: We need you to stay of couple of more hours. 

•Register backbling: Gives random prices when you eliminate an opponent. 

•Price Check pickaxe: Makes a beep when harvesting, nice red glow from the scanner. 

•B.O.B glider: Look for bottom of basket

Season 6 is approaching its end, and currently I am nowhere near reaching tier 100 of the battle pass.

Personally I felt that the challenges this season were made purposefully harder so that players would have more incentive to buy extra tiers, as most 10 star tiers this season required extra steps towards completion. Also, the week 10 challenges only award 15 tiers as opposed to the usual 50, which is an interesting change to say the least.

Maybe Fortnite could add a Double XP weekend? I’d hate to miss out on the Dire skin or any other high tier items for season 6...

I believe this mode could be even better if they added AKA Go-To-A Disco only so it gets all the players wanting to fight together for action.

Now it's not only acceptable and common for a player to kill a downed player, but its expected. This is decidedly unfun since you have to either kill yourself as the last remaining player on your team or force your friends to sit on their hands for nearly 20 minutes. It didn't use to be this way but with the advent of ""competitive"" fortnite it's a common occurrence for streamers and subsequently most players 

My proposal: make downed players invulnerable when down, *BUT* they lose their loot when shot at while down. Therefore mitigating the problem of playing in a party with friends without punishing players who may need ammo or weapons early game.",FortNiteBR

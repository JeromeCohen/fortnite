Obviously they don’t carry shields and health because they are pretty good but for someone like me that gets hit more than I hit them and am not a very good builder what would you recommend I go with for a loadout. 

I usually run AR, shotgun, SMG, grenade, heals/shield. 

I like to hold some kind of grenade because it helps with build battles. I tend to just throw a grenade/dynamite/stink instead of trying to build. 

Should I replace the grenade with shields/heals or sniper if possible or stick to that? Also with the Smg I just tend to keep that to break down builds fast. If there’s a deagle I’ll use that as it breaks builds faster. But could I replace the Smg for sniper?

The first season and a half I was learning the game and really didn’t win often, but once I caught my stride I was getting wins fairly consistently and averaging over 10 kills a win during the early seasons. I even played some solo squads to try to get high scoring 20+ kill games which I sometimes was able to achieve. 

Last two seasons I haven’t really played because the changes and game felt awfully different. I recently came back this season and it just feels so difficult to win. I don’t know if it’s the ability for players to move around and third party with ease or what else it could be, but I find the game much harder to win in the current season than it used to be previously. Which is ironic because the whole thing Epic is trying to appeal toward is the ‘casual’ players being able to obtain wins when it’s hard for the experienced players to do so consistently now (IMO).

What do you guys think?

TL;DR: used to win a lot in older seasons, now it feels like it is much harder to get wins in current season consistently. Why?",FortNiteBR

I have zero desire to play a game with vehicles in it. Especially planes. I thought maybe it was just me getting sick of Fortnite for a bit of season 6,  so I took a break about a month ago and played other games, thinking maybe it was just a break I needed from Fortnite to let myself get back into it. But since then I haven't even played a single game and I have no desire to play anymore. Everytime someone asks me to play Fortnite, I think to myself ""that would be fun"" but then I remember it has kamikaze planes now.

The idea as it was explained to me is, currently we have lots of snow, but soon that snow is going to melt and we should end up with some more watery areas. What better than a duck skin for when that happens. There was some debate about the name for the skin but I think ""QuackShot"" won out. He is the sworn enemy of the Tender Defender so one of the pickaxe designs was named the ""Tender Dismember"".

Aggressive play isn’t rewarded at all, and it just makes playing aggressive harder and more RNG than it should be. Playing with no shields is basically impossible with the new additions and buffs. Shotguns for example are very powerful right now ( i like shotguns in the state they’re in right now don’t get me wrong), and if you’re stuck with 75 health and bandages you are basically dead. Pop up cups are just so refreshing and fun, once you start playing them you don’t wanna go back to pubs, and that is bad considering that you can only play cups for a limited time of 5 hours per day and only 30 games. The best way to win pubs is to land uncontested, farm up and play passive. This is just my take on it, let me know if i said something wrong.

I play on console btw ( ps4 ).
even the "" insta edit "" doesnt work with 80 ms or 90 ms which means i need to hold it like 1 seconds instead of tapping it once with that ping. pieces of my building doesnt place correctly with higher ping.  I die a lot of times because of my ping, i shoot player before they shoot me and i die even if i hit my shots. I try to edit quickly but there is a bug when you try to edit you wall your gun shoot and you messed up your edit. i tried quickly to block a rocket coming to me and i saw that i placed a wall in front of me and the rocket phased my wall and killed me because of ping and the wall doesnt place till i die. i guess i will nevee improve and this is exactly my stable skill level for ever unless epic create an african server which i dont think they will do soon. 

i get rage on a 80~100ms ping , i did read that ocean and brazil servers are worst with more than 200ms ping.

The content has stayed fresh, epic haven’t changed their formula and keep weekly updates. Are these updates not enough anymore or am I just used to this amount of fresh content?

The start of season 7 was probably the best experience I’ve had in game but it’s quickly changed back to how it was in season 6 or maybe even worse than that.

I’m not sure if it’s because every fight feels like a 50/50 because the skill level of players is just getting better and better or if it’s because of all the new things to the game.

So I have an idea about how Epic should celebrate the 10th season of Fortnite. Many agree that the older seasons of Fortnite are arguably better than the newer seasons. Whether or not you personally may agree with that, that should be the main theme of Season 10. 

Nostalgia. 

For that Battle Pass, we would be presented with older skins. You know, the ones that many haven’t gotten due to joining Fortnite too late or due to financial difficulties or whatever. It would bring back many players looking for that nostalgic feeling of playing Fortnite for the first time with their friends. 

“But Epic has already said that they won’t bring back old skins!” True, they did say that. However, they’ve brought back old weapons that have been vaulted through a game mode. Why not also bring back old skins through the Battle Pass? 

“But it would undermine all of the people who earned those skins back in those seasons!” The only skins that are worthy of that is the Level 100 skins and I can see why. However, I have an idea for that. Instead of having people who get up to level 100 get all of the previous level 100 skins, why not have them....

Choose?

The game would give you an option. One level 100 skin. That way, you’d have to earn the skin that the others who played the season when it came out did too. Plus, it wouldn’t be cheapening the work gone into earning the skins the first time. 

“But what if I have all of the skins?”

To the people who have played Fortnite since Season 1, I commend you. That’s why I have a solution for that as well: V bucks. As they level in the season pass, they get more and more V bucks. While this is happening, they are presented with items in the item shop that aren’t usually in there. I’m thinking either festive stuff or possibly even skins that either were fan made or skins that didn’t make it to the game. 

And it doesn’t have to be just skins! For this season, they’d bring back everything. Every gun that was ever in the game. I’m talking Revolvers, Drum Guns, Homing Missile, etc. Every single gun that was ever put in the game. Hell, if Marvel can allow it, we could possibly do a Thanos mode again or go with that same idea but do the Infinity Blade. 

Now this is all just an idea. I’d like to hear your thoughts on this. Any feedback on this is welcome!",FortNiteBR

* PS4
* Xbox

I'm leaning towards the Switch mainly due to being able to play anywhere (not on the crappy phone) but at the sametime I want the game to look nice. I've heard the Switch got a performance update which made it run better, but it's graphics are still a bit on the eeeh side. Xbox I heard sort of runs like ass. I don't know if it's true, it's just what I heard. The one version I hear is better is the PS4 version. How true is that? Is it the go-to version for us console players?

1. Quadcrashers: planes and quads both can boost to destroy structures and knock players back to deal damage. However, planes are in the sky AND have a turret. So basically, planes are quads with more health, in the sky, with three more passenger seats, AND with a turret!! AND you can jump off to redeploy your glider! There is no logic to having quads and planes in the same game.

2. Unlimited ammo: as Tfue put it, “I have limited ammo while WALKING and he has UNLIMITED ammo while FLYING.” This speaks for itself.

3. Hard to counter: while ground based weapons have a simple counter (building), planes don’t have this simple counter. When you’re on the ground white a plane flying towards you, the plane can shoot unlimited bullets at you to subdue you as you have to spam build and waste mats or take damage, and then ram into you while boosting to afflict damage that doesn’t even go to shield, but - 

4. all damage from getting rammed by a plane goes DIRECTLY TO HEALTH. 

Conclusion: while it is true that the map is bigger and planes are fine as just a mobility item, these points show that the planes need 
a) a health nerf
b) the turret removed

Vaulting the 6 shooter would up the drop rate of shotguns which is crucial during early game. Finding anything but a pump early game is heartbreaking. Let’s face it, there aren’t many trash players anymore, most people can hit a headshot with a pump, so finding a tac shotty with a low damage is heartbreaking when your opponent has a pump. 

The heavy shotgun doesn’t have a place right now because it doesn’t have the ability to one tap. We need to have the current stats of the gold heavy dropped to uncommon/common rarity. It’s a big change I know, but stop lying to yourself, the heavy is not that good in comparison to any pump. You can be less accurate with pumps and do more damage. This would put it in line with its current worth in my opinion.

The heavy shotgun does not offer what is currently needed in fortnite to be competitive. We are all relatively good at this point. At no point would I want a gold heavy over and blue pump. Why? Because when I get 3rd partied in a game where they continuously make that easier through various mobility items, I always keep things close quarters for the 1 tap when I have low HP. The gold heavy does not have that ability therefore is of less value.

Some people like to go full out Nickmercs and drop tilted every game. Others may drop somewhere safer and try to rotate for kills. Maybe you're fine with looting and hiding all game and thats totally fine.

Me personally, I like to land somewhere kind of chill and then make my rotations to look for kills. I do this mainly because I can't stand fighting early game with no materials. Going somewhere like salty or retail you're guaranteed to get some fights, but there's always a chance you'll run out of materials because you can't adequately farm. 

Typically I'll land at the Racetrack, Snobby Shores, and Fatal Fields. I'll only do the race track and snobby if its the first place the bus crosses over. I'll get around 600-800 materials and then try to rotate to a popular spot afterwards such as Paradise Palms or the viking mountain. 

The super aggressive play style I'd assume is the most fun way to play, but I just can't do it. Although I do push basically everyone I see, I don't go for those quick kills right off spawn. If I end up with 5-9 kills and a win, I'm pretty satisfied

I just wanna know how some of you play, as I know that your abilities and skill may bring about different play styles

A Hunger Games inspired mode.,"Re-reading the hunger games got me thinking, what if there was an ltm where anyone could form alliances and try to realistically survive? That’s the idea I want to share. This game mode would be similar to Save The World as it would be $5 for access to the mode as to not take all the players from normal battle royale.

FORM ALLIANCES:
Players are allowed to team whenever they want. Should you risk it and go alone, or would you team up to take on others? Of course, teamkill would be on, so you can betray those alliances. Proximity chat will also be a thing, so you can talk to your teammates. Always remember, only one person will win.

A LONGER GAME:
The game time will be much longer, around an hour long. This is to incentivize survival aspects and make you more aware about going for the win. This also deals with my next point.

A LARGER MAP:
The map for this game mode would be a tad bigger than PUBG’s map. If hour long gameplay was in the original fortnite map, gameplay would get stale and boring. Every game, aspects of the map would change. During games, sometimes it might rain. It could even snow. Maybe even a natural disaster. Every game would be different, as to spice things up.

SURVIVAL:
This game would be much different than the normal modes we are accustomed to. You would have a hunger bar. Some might hunt wild animals in game, some might eat berries or apples. It’s all up to you as to where you find food. In times like rainy or snowy weather, your character might get cold. Will you have enough healing items to stay alive in them? Of course, however, there will be items such as coats and umbrellas scattered around the map.

VEHICLES: There will be vehicles scattered around the map, but not nearly as much as there are now. All vehicles will also require fuel, and they make a lot of noise, so be careful. New vehicles will also be added in, such as dirt bikes and real cars. 

THE STORM: 
The storm will close in much slower than normal, due to the larger map and game. However, the storm will do a lot more damage, so make sure you don’t get caught in it.

ANIMALS:
Like pets, wild animals can be found around the map to hunt. Bears and other feral animals might attack back, so be careful. You may even get the chance to tame some to use in battles, but they can die.

CONCLUSION: This game mode would be similar to PUBG, but also vastly different.
Please put suggestions and criticisms in the comments! Have a good day and thanks for reading!

It seems that the mascots are depleting in health automatically without any opponent dealing damage. Lost a game when no opponent was in sight.

I was thinking about a gamemode without turbo building, I will explain why I personally think it's a good idea.

&amp;#x200B;

 Currently there's alot of people who just enable turbo building and hold their left mousebutton which causes alot of spam building, it blocks random shots  and it is easier to build with low amount of  practice. You could now question yourself, 'What could a mode without turbo building bring?' It encourages more gunfights instead of spam building fights. It requires more auctual building skill since you have to click by yourself to place down your walls, floors, stairs and pyramids instead of holding down your left mouse button. New players can also get better with the gamemode instead of them just getting destroyed by someone who plays the game 1 month longer than them and just holds down their left mouse button. It would be cool if turbo building would be removed completely from the game but I personally don't think Epic is planning on that, so it would still be cool if there would be a LTM or something.

&amp;#x200B;

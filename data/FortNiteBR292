On console you have to look at a structure and press 'circle' or whatever it is on Xbox. 

**You can't just press it, you have to hold it.** And that is where the problem lies IMO. First of all, why isn't the tap to search thing not effected on editting? 

Another problem I have is that, sometimes,  I  am not looking to my structure properly, and because of that,  when I press circle, it starts to build. You have to press circle again to go back to normal and in the heat of the moment this really  is annoying. 

I think there should be **another button for editting** that you have to **press**, just like on PC, where editting is not the only advantage they have.

The new shotgun would have no ammo loaded into it until you held down the “fire” button and when you held it down your character would start loading shells into the chamber/magazine, say one every .75 seconds,  and when you release the button it unloads all the shots loaded in quick succession. The most shells that could be loaded is 3 and it would be like the burst but a shotgun that couldn’t be swapped quickly back and forth and it rewards you for the the time you take to load the gun.

Soon there will be a 50v50 mode where one person is the Leviathan and team Leviathan will lead the creature to Greasy or Wailing. The other team will try to stop it (the villains). The game mode has infinite lives. That is all I have so far of the end of season 4/ start of season 5.",FortNiteBR

My name’s Matt. I got into Fortnite earlier this year and fell in love. I had a group of friends that played, but because of work/life getting in the way, it was hard to find time to play together. I didn’t love Solos, and queuing into Duos or Squads was a waste 99% of the time, so I started looking for better ways to find others I could play with. I tried using LFG subreddits, Discord, FB groups, and other sites/apps, but it still took so much time to find people, and I just wanted to play and grind XP.

&amp;nbsp;

Our team felt the same way, so we’ve worked together to build SCOUT. SCOUT is a new, completely free, Fortnite teammate finder app that is powered by AI. This AI will match you with other players, and will get better the more you use it by learning which type of players you enjoy playing with.

&amp;nbsp; 

We believe that this is an awesome solution for finding better teammates, and want to invite you to help us shape and grow the AI during our exclusive beta.

&amp;nbsp;

We’re launching a closed beta on July 6th with limited slots, and to give back to the community for your support, we’ll have all active users in the beta (signed up and actively matching with players) be eligible for V-Bucks giveaways planned for July/August!

&amp;nbsp; 

To sign up to the beta, and to learn more about the app, check out: https://www.joinscout.gg/

&amp;nbsp; 

Here’s a Gyfcat of the App in action, too! https://gfycat.com/PettySeveralCivet

(early testing version, assets and text subject to change)

&amp;nbsp; 

Claim your spot on the Beta Bus before they run out, help make sure nobody is ever without a teammate, and hopefully I’ll get to match with some of you on July 6th!",FortNiteBR

The way the rocket teleported around opening “rifts” (so to speak), I’m wondering if these wormholes are actually meant to be the permanent jump pads.

Think of it like this: you don’t want to risk landing at tilted and not get any loot, for example, so you land at lonely lodge. Loot up, and then jump into a wormhole that takes you up in the air to one of the rocket’s created “portals” and then you can glide into a more populated area.

I feel like this would make more neglected zones on the map much more viable, and would make us less reliant on a jump pad in the event that the safe zone ends up on the complete opposite side of the map. Less running. Less storm deaths.

Now, no worries I can just refund the skin, but the person must have been mad that I didn’t have a credit card to use and used all 3 of my refunds. I have tried to contact Epic about this but just get automated emails from their customer services saying to refund the skin (I can’t). Is there any way to contact Epic other than their basic auto email customer service? It sucks because I was saving my Vbucks for the new season pass and now I can’t even refund anything.

After everything today I think I have formed the ultimate season 5 theory. But first, I’d like to point out some observations I made.

(Please read the entire post, but if not there is a TL;DR at the bottom)

The crack in the sky. Remember that theory a while ago about how Battle Royale is a simulation? This supports it even more. Not only do you disappear with that drone when you die, but today we have confirmation that the map is in a dome. This doesn’t have anything to do with my theory but I was just pointing it out.

Also, I don’t think the thrusters that landed in anarchy will have any future significance ever again. Usually story items that are important (like the meteor in dusty) are unbreakable. The thrusters however are breakable and I don’t think this is a bug as it seems they were purposely set at 2000 health.


Alright, finally starting off with my theory.
There were many leaks on season 5 being ancient/history themed. I think this will happen but we have to discuss how it will happen, I believe that the visitor has left the dimension and entered a new one. I say this because he disappeared, made a portal type thing, and there was a voice in the rocket saying  “engaging multi-dimensional” or something like that. But he accidentally left that crack in this dimension. This has caused a massive ripple in the space time continuum and now things are going to leak through the portal from hundreds of years ago. The season 5 trailer will be all kinds of things flooding out of the crack in the sky and falling onto the map, and we will get a new POI, possibly the pyramids of Giza or something along those lines. We will also get a history themed battlepass.

This also ties in with the rumor about the Red Knight returning with the datamined Crimson Pickaxe. A knight is mentioned in the game files for the pickaxe. 

Also, the sky stalker skin we got was from WW1, which of course was a long time ago.

I also wanted to thank epic for hosting such a wonderful and enticing event today! I would love to see more like this.

If you have anything you’d like me to add to this theory, comment it and I’ll take a look. 

#TL;DR Season 5 will be history themed and there are many things pointing to this happening.
#
See you all on the battle bus!

EDIT: As u/LiberalFeminist99 pointed out, the rift could also pull things from the future too!

EDIT 2: Also, u/Chriz146 pointed out that we could not be in a dome since the meteors just punched through the map.

EDIT 3: As u/marcoboyle pointed out, there is a rift at Lonely Lodge. I think maybe every POI will transform one by one into the history theme. 

EDIT 4: Omen and Fate are supposedly time travelers? This could also play into that theme since they were “villains”. But I think they were just actors like carbide and omega. 

EDIT 5: Check out u/IAMNOTELLEN ‘s post.
They talk about how the visitor teleported many times and ended up in all kinds of eras. All those eras are now connected to that giant crack in the sky and will all come out and mess up the map.

EDIT 6: u/ViewtifulAaron pointed out that the Leviathan that people thought would hatch from the meteor could fall out of the rift in the sky and enter the world then destroy moisty.

EDIT 7: The spectrogram of the rocket audio shows this: https://twitter.com/TwoEpicBuddies/status/1012039860738281472

EDIT 8: As u/Je11o said, could the Dino footprint have anything to do with the theory?

EDIT 9: Also would like to add that in the playground trailer here: https://youtu.be/g5PeLQmYOYk There are some things that could support my theory of a history theme. You can see players building a pyramid, the Sphinx, and there is a part set in the Wild West. Could these be hinting at a history theme?

EDIT 10: We also have detective skins coming soon and the tommy gun. This also shows that it doesn’t have to be ancient and could even be set in the 50’s or something.

EDIT 11: Check out this post about how Vertex plays in to this whole thing: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vaim3/rocket_mystery_solved/?st=JJ3397XA&amp;amp;sh=86478a25

EDIT 12: The rift at lonely lodge has gotten bigger.  I think it’s going to slowly consume that entire POI. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vbt5l/it_has_changed/?st=JJ3AGGUO&amp;amp;sh=3e676acb

I’ve seen players diagnose their goal to be impossible as far back as mid June after having to calculate the number of hours they can squeeze  in a day and how much more XP they need. 

At this stage, I think Epic have created a chore, something that some players will feel they have to do, not something that they want to. 

I understand the nature behind this idea is to reward the players who have invested the most time but I have also seen it deflate and remove the enthusiasm from quite a number of players I play with. 

This is why I feel Epic have made a mistake, perhaps the solution was to make the reward less remarkable or to even the goal but that didn't happen. 

Does anyone else share this opinion? What changes would you make in Season 5 comparable to now?

I am very curious to see what someone who paid for a number of battle pass tiers has to say on this subject too, I can only imagine that paying for the rewards and then finding you have to invest that many hour into the game must be deflating.

\-There was already a film being made before the events of the meteors

\-The comet struck dusty and meteors hit many parts of the map including the prison where an unknown person was held captive (now known as Omen)

\-The crew in-charge of making the film were overruled by the government to cover up the meteors and comet as being part of the film and thus reworking the plot of the whole film to include the theme of superheroes and invasions (where Valor, Squad Leader, Omega, Carbide are introduced)

\-Fate is Omen's companion (who was not in prison but hidden somewhere on the map and had the ability to forecast the meteors coming to release Omen from prison)

\-The villains lair originally belonged to/created by Omen (who was captured and imprisoned), the location was taken over by the government who used it as the evil lair to film the cover-up of the meteors and comet strike

\-Omega/Carbide/Valor/etc are all just actors and not actually super-heroes, the armored and unarmored versions were just extra suiting to look cool in the movie but taken off when not filming for easy movement and relaxation as seen in Week 6 blockbuster loading screen

\-Ventura/Venturion were also actors used in the movie as the cover up of whatever bust out of the pod in dusty (who was actually ""The Visitor"")

\-The Visitor is a non-movie character who accidentally entered Earth's (or whatever planet FN BR is in) atmosphere and crashed, his goal is to reach his final destination 

\-The reason Omen was imprisoned originally was because he was using the missle/rocket for harm (to blow up tilted) but was captured/found, the rocket already had been programmed by Omen to take flight and coordinated it (after escaping prison) to blow up tilted (this happened before ""The Visitor"" escaped his pod in dusty)

\-The TV's displaying a countdown timer was Omen/Fate's doing, they are the real villains

\-The Visitor found the missle/rocket afterwards and started upgrading it to flow through space and time continuum to get back on course to his final destination (before he went into Earth's orbit) without completely altering the coding set by Omen (he just overwrited parts of the code Omen wrote), Omen had it set to impact straight on tilted but The Visitor used the initial part of the code that was already set up to stay the same and used the straight down impact to carry momentum into a portal before impacting tilted in order to help create the space rift

\-The Visitor is neutral, not good or evil, he has a bigger mission in hand which will be explained later

\-Vertex is a type of security enforcer that came to track down The Visitor (from the same planet The Visitor came from, Vertex arrived at a delayed time because he had to track down where The Visitor went)

\-The Visitor is on the run and had little time (because he knew the enforcers would catch up to his location thus why he didn't fully reprogram the rockets spike downwards to destroy tilted and instead used it as momentum through portals to create a big enough space rift to his final destination) you can treat this like us programmers being lazy coders and reusing code to create other things

\-The Visitors intention is to get back to his final destination and alert ""someone"" of a greater danger that is imminent (he had no intention of landing on Earth or tampering with Earth)

\-The greater danger is Oblivion (the female omega datamined) who is the real ""omega"" and not a character in the ""movie""

\-What happens next? Oblivion is alerted (by Fate) of the space rift created and will enter our dimension to finish what Omen couldn't do but to a greater extent of damage (Omen and Fate work under her command and are now awaiting the inevitable)

\-The only question left is, who is the Visitor reporting the danger to?

\-Oh, and the detectives (datamined) are just normal people trying to investigate on these unusual activities

That's because I didnt play the game JUST to get full omega. I played it because I throughly enjoy it and it happened over time. After I did some math it took approximately three hours per day from the start to get level 80 two weeks ago. Not only that but we are in the middle of a double exp weekend right now. Obviously not everyone has time to play all the time but chances are you can put in at least a few hours this weekend for the extra exp. No one is being forced to get full omega. It's not a life or death situation. If you got burnt out by getting full omega than you weren't playing for fun in the first place. Just thought I'd throw in my opinion.

Some guy picks up an LMG at the beginning of every game and it’s 120 Ammo against your 40 or 10. It’s the gun used to destroy everything you’ve built to defend yourself when you just get out of a fight and win. Seriously, the only use for the gun is taking down forts, but it is really used as a close range gun and it does deserve changes at the very least if it will continue to be used this way.

Please let the portal take us back to the good old days of Fortnite. This game has become absolutely horrible and some of the stuff Epic does is legitimately stupid. Every update just makes the game easier for bad players. The community is absolutely brainwashed and won't believe anything I say but Epic ur killing us. The buffs to the smg's are stupid. Plain and simple. You buffed smg's so that people who aren't good enough to use shotguns don't have to, and nerfed the shotguns into the ground. I shouldn't have to carry two shotguns in order for them to be effective. You added Port-A-Forts for kids that can't build. Bloom makes AR' s useless. People use the suppressed subs as AR's now. This shouldn't be possible. I don't enjoy myself playing this game anymore ever. I'm sick of having to get into a build fight every F@#&amp;ing time I see someone just to get killed because the kid has an smg and shoots me out or melts me or gets lucky headshots because of bloom. Epic has essentially put the bad players on the same level of good players with all the stupid crap they've added. Equality in video games is good but all epic has done is make the game not worth to grind because no matter what happens you are going to die to some new stupid stuff they've added. I'm not bad at the game. I have 200+ wins and I haven't played the game consistently in months. Give us the old fortnite back please. Make shotguns useful. Get rid of the constant buildfighting.

I'm both a StW and BR player and i spend lots of my time in this game. Fortnite is still not a finished product and every fortnight (this is 14 days) we get a new patch which improves the game most of the time. However there are still a few things that bother me and i'm pretty sure i'm not the only one. 

First i want to talk about the challenge system. Not only the dailies but also the weekly challenges. There are a few unique challenges but most of the time it is something that is doable in 5-15 matches. Looking for gnomes is fun but i doesn't really feel like a challenge, getting 3 kills is nice but when everyone drops at the same spot it just doesn't feel fun to do since most of the time you will just be running around like a chicken without a head, and without a gun...

My take on a rework of the weekly challenge system. Is simple, make challenge more open to the world, don't let them be strict to one location. Also increase the amount needed for completion. They are weekly challenges after all, aren't they? Don't get me wrong. Not all challenges are bad. For example i enjoyed spraying over the omega/carbide posters and finding duckies and gnomes isn't that bad.

Some concepts/reworks for *weekly* challenges:

* Get 15-25 kills with [a specific weapon]
* Destroy 50 trees (works with other objects as well)
* Travel 5 kilometers in a single match
* Heal 500 hp with a campfire
* Destroy 200 playerbuild structers (walls/stairs/roofs/floors)

Some concepts/reworks for *daily* challenges:

* Destroy 5 [items] ( couches, desks, lamps, televisions etc)
* Loot 1000 bullets
* Dance on top of X location
* Use 3 medkits

Season 3/4 challenges i think are well made:

* Score goals
* Dance in different forbidden locations
* The discoball in loot lake
* Dance on different dance floors
* Search dukkies/gnomes
* Spray over different posters

The other thing i want to talk about is XP. I know not everyone is able to get full omega but this isn't really a bad thing. However the XP is still not great. BR is a survival game which is fine but people should be rewarded for other things as well. It is ridiculous that you get 300 xp when you end outside of top 10 with a lot of kills. 

Again, i think my fix is pretty simple for this problem.

* Lower XP gained for placement
* Remove XP given for kills
* Gain 1 XP for every 10 player damage you do to an enemy (200 hp = 20XP)
* Keep 50 XP for first elimination
* Give 25 XP for reviving downed teammates ( only 4 times)
* Give players XP for moving around (rewarding players for running around instead of waiting out placement for more XP)

With the XP explained above you will get more in total if you play the game as you should. Instead of waiting in a bush to get the most xp (which is the current meta for XP grinding) you will get rewarded for actually playing the game.

TL;DR Rework challenges and XP. Just check out the bullet points and you will understand.",FortNiteBR

The Visitor's plan explained!,"The Visitor came from a different time period, most likely the future. The hop rocks were ""samples"" of what his technology was capable of accomplishing.

Omega/Carbide/Valor/Venturion were all fake. They're simply the main characters of a super-hero movie franchise. The house and the villain lair are all props from the films.

The Visitor, dedicated to returning home, modifies the fake rocket into a functional time machine utilizing the hop rocks, and other samples of his time period's tech that fell on the island.

The ""cracks"" you saw on the rocket's launch were tears upon the fabric of the space-time continuum. The Visitor did several loops through the island to get enough speed to completely RIP through space-time so he could go back home.

[Now, you may be wondering, why did the final crack stay while the others quickly vanished?](https://i.redd.it/7sv8z4z2wd711.jpg)

Well, to put it simply, The Visitor fucked up.

He created such a large tear through our universe that he caused permanent damage to our dimension as a whole.

But what can we expect within the following weeks?

The crack will get even bigger, and time will start ""leaking"" through it. Pieces of ancient and modern history will fall through the universe, causing the island to get a major visual revamp. Pretty much the exact thing that happened at the ending of the film Mr. Peabody and Sherman!",FortNiteBR

My scenario is I went on holiday for the half term holidays, and I lost 14 days of Fortnite time to build up my levels.
As of present I am at level 59, but it is genuinely impossible to get to level 80 now, because there is no way I can gain over 20,000XP per day.

I just dont want to grind so much or else I'll actually start getting bored of it (which I slowly am because of this). Having to grind so much is actually a bad thing sometimes. 


Even with double xp, I shouldn't have to grind to get an enhancement for a skin. Everyday after work I have to play the game to try and get Lv80 for so many hours. It takes so much time away from so many things I wanna do like go to the gym, spend time with family. Heck I wanna continue playing some other games that I enjoy but I've committed now and currently Lv78 but still I shouldnt have to play Fortnite up to 7 hours a day trying to level up.


All I'm saying is the XP grind is way too much compared to last season. Once I'm lv80, I'm probably not gonna play for a while, I think I've had my good share of Fortnite in the last couple of weeks.

Make of it what you will, but here it goes. Potential Spoilers ahead

I've been going through the datamined audio files of the event, and trying to correlate each one to it's part in the rocket launch. Out of all of the audio files, which you can download here, here are the correlations.

+ Geode_Tear_Enter_01.ogg is the rocket entering the tear above tilted.
+ Geode_Tear_Enter_02.ogg is the rocket entering the tear above the footprint by Greasy (the second teleport)
+ Geode_Tear_Exit_03.ogg is the rocket exiting the tear above Moisty
+ Geode_Tear_Exit_04.ogg is the rocket exiting the tear above Loot Lake
+ Geode_Tear_ExitFinal_05.ogg is the rocket hitting the leaving the crack in the sky.
There are some more audio files that relate to the takeoff, but the more interesting files are contained in the folder ""Oddities"".

This folder contains two files:

+ Geode_Oddities_InWorldLoop_01.ogg
+ Geode_Oddities_Teleport_17.ogg

InWorldLoop refers to the ambient sound in the world produced by the tear in the sky (you can hear it better if you look at it), but the most interesting file is Teleport.

This ""Teleport"" sound file has not been heard any time during the launch event, nor from the weird portal at Lonely Lodge or the tear in the sky. This file, from it's name and also how it sounds, suggests that something teleports through either the tear in the sky or the portal thingy at Lonely Lodge.

I suggest giving this audio file a listen as it's very interesting and, although it's currently unknown what may appear through this ""teleport"", it's fair to assume that this may happen before the end of Season 5, perhaps even this week.

Note: For those verifying this for yourself, I've excluded the _opt audio files as they are purely just alternate sounds for the same thing, just slightly different for different circumstances and audio setups.

TL;DR: The one audio file we haven't heard yet suggests that something teleports into the world of Fortnite through either the tear in the sky or possibly even the weird portal thingy at Lonely Lodge.

My first thread got 20k views with 1k upvotes. Fortnite didn't do anything so the thread died. Second time, I got a lot more publicity for this and everyone called me a cheater, some people luckily experienced this before and had bypassed it and wanted to help me. This is my third time and I bet im going to get hate for this, even though I didn't doi anything, but why not step up for us, I've got nothing better to do in everyone elses eyes. 

1ST THREAD LINK -https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8or6al/fortnite_br_kicked_out_of_the_bus_glitch_3k/



2ND THREAD LINK - https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8v9kin/fortnitebr_bus_glitch_3k_people_experiencing_this/

So here's the thread with proof of the problem and what Epic need to do. No doubt this will be removed though:

Example of the problem - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfxN4tExFOw

Currently I've been waiting since christmas to be unbanned due to this glitch. I've filed 5 emails towards epic games with no response and 3 reddit posts which epic games didn't help me either. The glitch consists of the user being kicked out of the bus before the game starts. The kick message will say ""You have been kicked out of the bus for VPN/IP"". Some people are saying it's a glitch, however some people say we're banned. However all of us have done nothing wrong, being serious when I got banned I didn't know if there even was cheats. I barely even know if theirs cheats now.

There is tons of videos with around 50,000 views where they try to help unban people. This just shows how many people get the problem. Please help us now because honestly this glitch isn't letting us play the game. We've tried resetting pcs, IP's, Identites, deleting things in regedit and changing our pcs profile.

Here is more videos to proove that we're not lying:

These are just some of the videos that people have uploaded to help us. There is no way around this glitch, please help us epic games we didn't cheat or do anything wrong. Thanks for reading I guess.",FortNiteBR

So I encourage you to combat this by giving it your all (if you have time) and getting to 80. Getting to 80 is possible if you have the time, just afk in a tree in the middle of the first circle in solos, easy 1082 - 1400 xp per match this weekend.

Long post here, but I threaded it with pictures too keep the interest lol. So with the rocket being launched and the whole mystery behind what we saw, I wanted to take a look back through season 4 and see what everyone’s thoughts on what’s happening is. Let’s start with a timeline of season 4.

[Season 4](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YsCh_FI2cvSwAyUTyUbcc-6cYGs=/0x0:1920x1080/1200x800/filters:focal(799x205:1105x511)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59680503/Fortnite_Season_4.0.jpg)

To kick it off, we had the great buildup in season 3 with the meteor getting closer and finally crashing into Dusty Depot, created season 4’s “[Dusty Divot](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/erikkain/files/2018/05/dusty-divot.jpg).”  Along with the new season and Dusty Divot, we get all of the movie sets, as well as the [hero](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fdavidthier%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2Ffortnite-secret2.jpg) and [villain](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Finsertcoin%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2Ffortnite-secret1.jpg) lair and other small meteor crash sites. Notably the villain lair featured a massive [missile](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ya0YfNboBzQ/maxresdefault.jpg), still unsure of the purpose of it.

Also, oddly, a [footprint](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Finsertcoin%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2Ffortnite-secret8-dino-footprint.jpg) is seen just outside Greasy Grove. Some drew ties to the Dinosaur skins that had been added while others suggested it was related to a Leviathan game mode leak.

We have the [meteor](https://www.pcgamesn.com/sites/default/files/fortnite%20dusty%20divot%20meteor.jpg) inside Dusty Divot which slowly was [drilled away](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Finsertcoin%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F06%2Ffortnite-meteor1.jpg) to reveal “[The Visitor](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fdavidthier%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F06%2Fblockbuster7-1200x600.jpg)” skin in week 7. Apparently this extraterrestrial being entered the Fortnite universe accidentally. In the beginning, before the visitor is revealed, we're led to believe that the heroes and villains are [in battle with each other](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/143/590x/Fortnite-Week-5-967695.jpg?r=1527833307002). But later we find out that the whole ""hero/villain"" theme was simply just movie sets and that Carbide, Omega and the other skins aren't fighting but simply [movie characters](https://fortniteinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Season-4-Week-6-Blockbuster-Challenge-Loading-Screen-in-Fortnite-Battle-Royale.jpg).

Through the weeks we also have the various meteor crash sites slowly being filled in and the ""hop rocks"" being collected and [transported](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/fortnite/thumb/2/24/S5speculation4.png/700px-S5speculation4.png) toward the villain lair. Clearly the ""hop rocks"" are energy filled crystals as they give the players the ability to jump very high. At one point a [bunker](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Finsertcoin%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2Fwailing-woods-bunker-fortnite.jpg) is added to Wailing Woods. It seems to extend decently down [into the ground](https://i.redditmedia.com/1gsZljzW8mil9Z9XSkIrYfUYA7GfRhEy5po7x4U-mWE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=b246e7f5419d5046c54c7534bb4c358e).

As the season progresses we find The Visitor working on the [controls](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/143/590x/Fortnite-Blockbuster-loading-screen-secret-stars-979793.jpg?r=1530091232264) of the missile. That's the last loading screen we get revealed. A [countdown](https://assets.rockpapershotgun.com/images//2018/06/fortnite-rocket-base-620x300.jpg) gets started on the TVs and in the villain lair and as we draw closer to the launch of the missile we hear sirens going off throughout the map. Can we assume that The Visitor used the rocket to return home?

Finally, the [missile launches](https://fortniteinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Rocket-Launch-770x423.jpg) and we see this strange display. If you havn't seen it, watch it [HERE](https://youtu.be/8doh396pBBA). So the rocket launched, laser beam pinpointed Tilted Towers, then appeared to go in and out of the dimension (from how I’d describe it)  and finally leaving us with this massive [“crack” in the sky](https://twinfinite.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fortnite-sky.png). Also, there is an odd [""portal""](http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/embed-lg/public/2018/06/30/fortnite-lonely-lodge-portal.jpg) like thing going on at Lonely Lodge now.

Also two other things to note is that the [audio file related to the missile launch](https://fortniteinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Fortnite-rocket-audio-code-leak-moisty-mire-rocket-target.jpg) had coordinates encoded in binary within it, the coordinates being B6, H9, I8, I9. There also is now an [odd message](https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Finsertcoin%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2Fwailing-woods-bunker-fortnite2.jpg) written on the bunker  in Wailing Woods which, as far as I'm aware, hasn't been deciphered. Additionally, an upcoming [back bling](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/fortnite-back-bling-cluefinder.jpg) (Spoiler) has a [note attached](https://imgur.com/a/inKic3A) to it featuring what appears to be a tree from Moisty Mire and a large footprint like the one by Greasy Grove.

So that brings us to this point, were a little less than 2 weeks away from season 5. I can't say I have any good idea of where this is going but I want to know what you all think. My thought is possibly the crack in the sky will be a sort of time travel ability or portal into another dimension? 

What questions do we have and any info to share?

I am confused as to why the missile in the villain base, if the hero/villain plot was actually just a movie set, why the missile was actually functional? Only thing I can think is that Omen (who never actually appeared in any movie set photos) is the actual villain and omega and the others are just movie cast.

Looking forward to hearing everyones thoughts, more information and some discussion on this season and next.",FortNiteBR

Now I know it's a stretch, but what if it's more specific than just that. 

Well there are some clues recently that lead me to believe (and I'll offer my firstborn up to EPIC on video WITH NINJA gone wild edition if i'm wrong) that we may be getting a completely FRIENDS related season.

The irrefutable proof: 

1) Tilted Towers is clearly analogous to New ~~Donk~~York City which is where the most notorious version of our boy Matthew Perry resides. 

2) Risky Reels is where Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell went to answer Matthew Perry trivia in the hit song ""Lazy Sunday""

3) Sony doesn't want us to play with our FRIENDS

4) The visitor left. What do visitors on the show FRIENDS usually do at the end? You called it hombre... THEY FUCKIN LEAVE

5) If you rearrange the letters of FRIENDS you get FORTNITE (unconfirmed)

6) If you ADS at the rift or get near the rift at Lonely Lodge you can vaguely hear the theme song to FRIENDS playing! The effect is really a lot more noticeable if you also play the theme song on YouTube in the background.

7) They added investigators into the game just like the time where Rachel investigated Monica to see if she stole Rachel's Golden SCAR (disclaimer: I've never actually seen FRIENDS, but this sounds about right) 

8) Rachel had a golden SCAR on the show (see disclaimer above) 

9)  a total of 6 rifts were created during the rocket launch event (Tilted, Moisty, Greasy, Loot Lake, Skycrack, and Lonely Lodge). Do I even need to tell you why the number 6 correlates to the show?

10) The filename for the completed rocket in the game files is chandlermobile.rkt

Now I know this isn't technically PROOF as much as OBJECTIVE CORRECTNESS, but you'll all be thanking me when you see that the tier 100 skin is just Jennifer Aniston in a bath towel.",FortNiteBR

They complain because of too much downtime on servers or too much lag or the double pump is broken. Yes this all may be true but for a game as massive as fortnite, epic does an 'epic' job at keeping everything up to date. Now I see people complaining about the playground mode taking forever to come back out but honestly would you like to play a broken game mode or would you rather have it as good as possible? My opinion is don't freak out and act like epic doesnt care about the fans because they definitely do considering every single thing I can see people trying to change, they tend to address it. My legit only complaint is for them to stop trying to change everything to be a competitive players game only. Like a pump shotgun it definitely should be able to one shot someone because you're at a huge disadvantage when you miss the first shot so the OPness off the pump is countered by how long the second shot takes.

Or could this just be from me playing with randoms who are somewhat incompatible with my play-style ? Usually when I do squads/duo with friends I always do good (especially when im in charge of where we go, positioning etc) , but with randoms I usually get shit on, which could be from me being forced to land with them and not being used to their positioning etc ?

Currently I've been waiting since christmas to be unbanned due to this glitch. I've filed 5 emails towards epic games with no response and 3 reddit posts which epic games didn't help me either. The glitch consists of the user being kicked out of the bus before the game starts. The kick message will say ""You have been kicked out of the bus for VPN/IP"". Some people are saying it's a glitch, however some people say we're banned. However all of us have done nothing wrong, being serious when I got banned I didn't know if there even was cheats. I barely even know if theirs cheats now.

There is tons of videos with around 50,000 views where they try to help unban people. This just shows how many people get the problem. Please help us now because honestly this glitch isn't letting us play the game. We've tried resetting pcs, IP's, Identites, deleting things in regedit and changing our pcs profile.

Well, today I was watching Ninja stream because fornite had a 10 minute queue, do I could not see what was about to happen by myself. He had over 300k viewers, and was playing with Tim the tatman and Dr lupo and some other guy which I don't know who he is. So let's say that a total of 400k where watching Ninja and his squad to see what was going to happen with the rocket. Well, they got to the top of where the rocket was getting launched, waited for the rocket to launch and... Well, killed everyone in there.

That's by far the biggest dick move I've ever seen in this community, he even missed the sky crack, and not only that, he fucked up the whole experience for the 400k people watching, and most importantly, for the few people he killed, who were there just to watch something unique and that cannot be repeated, after the whole hype that epic games put after that.

 i've looked this glitch up and I can't find anything on it so maybe it isn't something many people are able to do or maybe it just hasn't been noticed, but I doubt the latter.

 Im going to guess that it may be caused by playing on multiple platforms (more specifically, Xbox and PC). I orginally got all of the secret Battle Stars on Xbox, then I started playing Fortnite on PC and randomly noticed a Battle Star that I had gotten on Xbox was up for grabs again. So, I decided to check all the other ones, and I was able to get them all again!

 If anyone else has noticed they can do the same, let me know in the comments!

2. The Egypt/wild west theme for season 5 might be plausible. explained by the portal/crack in the dome thats eventually  going to crack more and more until the moment it cracks the dome. dimensions, universes slip into ours and transport us to an older/mid/future version of the map, or just a complete other world. like a desert, that world would fit in with the Egypt theory.
3. there will maybe be a new vehicle, a bike. An image of a bike was found in the game files. Also a campfire, and saloon styled sign.
4. there is a portal in lonely lodge, i dont know what its for, i just like to point it out.
5. the visitor spoke as he was in contact with the rocket, supposedly a speaker, where he could talk via the rocket. the rocket at the end said""Set coordinates"" now there isnt a specific coordinate where the rocket was going to land, although there where leaked coordinates in the game files. but it was a joke, the rocket just blasted into the air.
6. in the playground trailer they where building a piramid, and a further away shot of the buildings, there was a sphynx built as well. so the theory of the Egypt map is most likely to happen.

But you're not the first to try this, and it's not the best.

If you ever get the chance to look up

FINAL FANTASY XIV *End of Eorza*
(yes I tried to post a link, yes the dumbass auto moderater stopped me)

You'll find out that this game was a below average MMO, that had a ton of problems, technical and financial.
So the devs decided to trash the game, and release a fixed version down the line.
But it wasn't like Club Penguin where the service just ended with a message.

No,
This giant sphere shows up in the sky, and you start a quest line to prepare for the event.
And when the moment came; a beautiful, HD, 6 minute cutscene plays, where ALL OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD SHOW UP AND TRY TO STOP IT!

The greatest mage conjures the greatest magical summon to stop the meteor, AND THEY DO!

Until an all powerful dragon comes out of the debris, and kills reality.

I'm not a fan of Fortnite, hell I'm not even a fan of the game I'm talking about.

Buy when everyone is talking about how innovative Fortnite is, without knowing what they're talking about, I get mad.

And this event happened in 2012, SIX YEARS BEFORE THE ROCKET THAT Y'ALL WON'T SHUT UP ABOUT! 

So here's this post.

Hope you hate it.

New Map?,"I was playing 50v50 on xbox and put my marker down at Wailing Woods, near the end route of the blue bus route. But it glitched and wouldn't let me jump off. I thought, okay, well, it'll kick me off when I reach the end of the island so I'll just dive back.

But it didn't! I stayed on the bus for nearly five minutes! It kept flying and went over the next island.

It's shaped like a bent infinity symbol with a narrow ""pinch"" between the two wider parts and altogether it's about twice the size of the BR island. It looked almost fully developed -- villages/towns, remote buildings, paths, and what looked like an airport in the middle. I'm wondering if that is Save The World or a new map/world? (I don't have STW so I'm not sure if takes place in a different area or the same map as BR.) Beside of it, to the left, was another smaller island that seemed close enough to swim to.

The bus kept going past the developed island and there were more islands, less buildings but still with decent detail. One with a few houses near the shoreline and another with what looked like sailboats or ships in a harbor and then we flew over a huge island with a large mountain. The bus was going slower and slower as we headed toward the peak of the mountain and the graphics were very basic by that point, just a blanket of green for trees, like a low res topo map, no individual items visible. To the right in the distance was a massive, towering mountain that went almost straight up. It reminded me of the tower from Lord of The Rings.

At this point, when I looked back, the BR island was like a tiny dot behind me and the island where we get on the bus wasn't visible anymore. The 50v50 team numbers stayed at 49:50 the whole time and the storm countdown timer was at 0:00. 

I was expecting the bus to come to a stop and just sit there because it kept slowing down, but just as we reached the mountain peak, suddenly I zoomed backwards really fast to the BR island like in high speed rewind and the game made the sound like I just jumped from the bus and I was diving through the sky toward Wailing Woods. It was crazy!!

Right after this happened I searched ""stayed on the bus"" to see if this is a common glitch, but the only thing I could find were some videos from around Christmas where the bus went a little past the BR island. The next island visible in the Christmas videos was an undeveloped rectangle covered in trees.

But what I saw today was a well developed / inhabited island with a high level of detail on the buildings, similar to the current BR island but about twice as big, shaped like a curved infinity sign where the two loops are bent slightly towards each other.

I'm fairly new to FN (just bought my first skin yesterday actually!) and I don't know how the replay system works, so I'm sure someone is going to be a jerk about that, but it was a really cool experience and I wanted to share as much as I could remember while it's still fresh in my mind.

[About replay: A few days ago I went to the replay section for the first time, picked a video from the list to watch, and couldn't figure out how to exit the replay screen (but zooming around the action from all angles was frickin' cool!). I just went and looked at the list of videos and there is nothing there from today. Do they take a while to show up? Or do I have to actively do something to get it to record I don't remember doing anything to record the other replays that are shown in my list, but I might have pressed something accidentally.]

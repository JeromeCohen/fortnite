25,SomeRandomStickboy,1518479799,7x58av,196,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7x58av/why_i_hate_fortnite_br/,0,Why I HATE Fortnite BR,"The first thing I want to address is why I put this specifically on the Fornite BR reddit rather than some Fortnite BR hate reddit or something along those lines. I have never played Fortnite myself, however after watching videos and learning about the game itself I think I can come to a somewhat reasonable conclusion about the game. However, I want to state my dislikes here as to get feedback on whether Im wrong, right, or if someone just disagrees.

I VERY much want constructive feedback on this, positive or negative. Opinionated comments are of course welcomed, but Id prefer comments with solid evidence and experience. Now, without further ado, WHY I HATE FORTNITE BATTLE ROYALE:

The first thing to address is mainly the most mainstream and overused, but still standing issue: This is a blatant copy of PlayerUnkown’s Battlegrounds. The entire concept is the same, and the item and loot gathering system is identical. Unlike the reasons that can be used to refute accusations against something like Paladins, in which Hi-Rez worked on the game at the same time as Overwatch, Fortnite BR was developed after the release of PUBG and takes no indirect inspiration from it, but rather makes an identical game.

The second issue to address is the fact that its community is(inevitably) toxic. Its being free gives more accessibility to people under the age of, say, 13, which creates a community of children who can’t emotionally distinguish between a game loss and the murdering of everyone they’ve ever known and loved. 

The third issue is one of the worst: the trailers. The original Fortnite trailer was absolutely horrible, the voice acting and scripting was cheesy, and the trailer showed giant fortresses rather than actual game progression. In the newer trailer, theres a leviathan of a base with well over fifty players all taking out their OP weapons in unison to fight off a hoard of raiders. This is NOTHING like the actual game, as there is little communication between people going solo squad, and everybody is too lazy to build a fortress.

The fourth, final for now, and most important issue is the outright lack of general stuff. This is a copy of PUBG that somehow manages to lack a lot of what makes PUBG good. Ill give a short little list:
1. Attachments
2. First Person
3. Customization
4. Good communication
And thats just the beginning.

Anyway, Id like to conclude with a request:
Don’t leave comments like “ur wrong” or “OMG YO SUCK KYS” or the like. Preferably nowhere near the latter.

Peace.

Fix 1:
Add a cooldown to the pump shotgun after being switched to a new weapon. 
Example: If you have two pumps in your inventory and you shoot your first one, you can switch and shoot your secondary pump like you can now BUT when you switch back to your primary pump there's a delay. I'm thinking that you have to hear the ""schh-schh"" of reloading the next shell before shooting that pump again. So, you get your double-pump ability but you only get one chance this time. After that, you would have to ""pump your pumps"" before you can use the strat again.  

Fix 2:

Today we had a chill day and during one of the classes where the teacher was doing oral tests on students that failed the last written test.

The time stamps were obviously the times at which the zone shrinks in Fortnite, but I just couldn't figure out what the percentages meant. He was still going at it with his calculating, and he finally puts all the numbers into the calculator and gets 2070. So I ask him about those percentages. He says it's the odds of still being in the zone at different times of the match, without moving from your current position. And then I ask him why he needs that number. He says he will need to stay in one place in order to pull off something with his squad. And then I finally ask him about the number in the calculator... 2070.

Let me preface this by saying that I am an avid PUBG player. Though I'm not just a PUBG fanboy crying over jokes. I have been a Fortnite BR lover for the longest time. I remember when you had to pay $30 for the base game to play BR. I also remember when there were only 500 members of this subreddit.

Over the past month, however, this subreddit has become full of PUBG hate/roast titles. While I do find some of them funny from time to time, the fanboyism culture has made this a really petty sub. Highlight posts with PUBG shade in the title are extremely low effort titles and it takes away from the integrity of this subreddit IMO.

I'm not sure what needs to be done, but I just wish this subreddit would focus on Fortnite and not act so insecure about this wonderful game. Sure, discussion about the two games should be encouraged when appropriate, but titles consistently shitting on PUGB are incredibly toxic. I have NEVER seen a fortnite-hating title in r/pubattlegrounds. All in all, highlight videos and memes should not involve PUBG in the title, because we sure as hell know it isn't PUBG gameplay.

The only way you don't get killed before the 2nd shot is I your opponent is a potato or they get fucked by the bloom. If the pump becomes a mandatory 2 shot kill then it has no place in the game and might as well be erased.

Simply put single pump is in a good place and is completely balanced as is. Double Pump is the issue and does need to be changed. But PLEASE Epic don't shit on the single pump and make it completely worthless. It is already extremely balanced and fits well in its niche.

Coming from a console player, I agree with that claim and most of the points. For Fortnite, the PC offers a much more optimal way of playing the game - with better key bindings (one button to build certain structures, equip certain weapons), mouse for better accuracy, higher frames/better processing speeds, less input lag - these all create a wider skill gap and awesome highlights/montages on the PC.

However, something **no one really talks about** is EQUIPMENT.
Here are the [PC specs for Ninja](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/94y8bj), who is obviously a very popular streamer, and is regarded as one of the best Fortnite players currently. He has a $3500 setup, along with $1500 a month for internet (dedicated line). He has key bindings all over his mouse (something a lot of mouses can do, but still), and an expensive headset.

I've noticed a lot of the top tier players on PC have crazy expensive setups. This allows the best response times, visibility, etc. the gaming industry can offer. Of course these guys are very skilled, but how much of a pay to win aspect can be argued for on the PC side?

When Ninja drops into a game on the PC, he is faced against 99 other people. How many of these gamers can boast anywhere close to a setup he has? How many gamers does he face that who are using a laptop they use for school? He is likely seeing a lot of things others aren't, and it is insanely apparent at the end of matches when he seems to always find a bush wookie who can't respond to building/traps at the rate he can build and place them.

A guy like Nickmercs on the PS4, however (not to knock Ninja, I'm just making a point), dominates without the help of insane equipment. The console only maxes out at a certain point as far as equipment goes (for the Xbox that would be a nice monitor, headset, and Elite controller right now).

My point is, the distribution (from a monetary perspective) on the console is much closer together, which allows a more fair environment. I guess I'm just tired of this PC superiority so many PC players drop all over this sub, and people saying console players could never switch/do what PC players do - when the reality is we definitely could if we were willing to make a steep time and money investment. The skill gap still exists on console, and console players CAN BE extremely good at the game, when compared against their population.",FortNiteBR

Feel free to critique my opinions in the comments just don't be a toxic little shit please. :)

1. Double Pump - I'm as tired as everyone else is with hearing about the Double Pump needing a nerf but here is my idea for it. Allow carrying two pumps but when you shoot no matter what you need to pump it again before shooting. So you can go 1-2 then have a long wait, not 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2 over and over again.

2. Shotgun Damage -  Shotguns should not be able to take a full 200 shield away. I think we can all agree with that.
Shotguns should do much less to the head than they do now. Here is how i feel it should work.
White Pump/Green Tac = 110 Damage
Green Pump/Blue Tac = 120 Damage
Purple Tac = 135 Damage
All of these should be at close range ONLY. Heavy damage drop off should be put on the shotguns.
Also the purple tac is the highest damage since it is the highest rarity.
With the way the game is now it has very little use for being as rare.

3. The Problem With Tilted - I always see 30 to 40 people jump to Tilted and by the time the first circle ends it’s top 50 or so. It makes places that used to be hotspots barren and quite honestly, it makes the game boring if you don't want to go Tilted. I can’t tell you how many game I've played where I go to the old hotspots that would usually have at least 5 ish people landing at them. Salty Springs,Greasy Grove, Retail Row and Pleasant Park are abandoned at this point. Wish it would just get removed.

4. Shields - I'm gonna keep this one short.
Shields should only be to 50. Having to kill someone twice over is really annoying and takes a lot of skill out of the game
Small Shields should give 15 shield.
Full Shields should do 30.
Slurps do 20/20

5. RPG'S  - RPG's should do damage to structures only. 0 Damage should be done to players. I don't think anyone can say they got killed by an RPG and  felt like that player was better than them. It's too noob friendly when someone can just spray them at their feet and get a kill.

6.Minigun - Just remove this too please. It takes all ideas of building (The Main Thing That Makes Fortnite Special) out of the game. If you keep it please add a cool down or a limit of say 400 rounds per minigun. As it is it's too noob friendly like the RPG's.

I don't have anything to say about Bloom, Console Building, Console FPS, SBMM or Audio since they have already been touched on by the Devs.

This is meant to be constructive. I love Fortnite and don't want to see it go to shit. Thanks for reading!

Cheers! - Dragon

My basic thinking is to incorporate the systems already in place in FN to help the children become more engaged with Geography as a subject. The basic mechanics are already present in the game I.e. compasses on the top and basic map work. 

What I was hoping for is to see if the community think that this is a good idea or if it’s dreadful. If anyone can think of any tips for including this in my lesson please feel free to contribute I would love any further ideas. The lessons are aimed towards 12-13 year olds.

Here comes the downvotes.","Pump shotguns are too strong in their current state. They are single handedly ruining the possibility of variety within the CQC section of the game, and double pumping is only adding to it. Why run an SMG, or a Pistol, when you can oneshot someone with a pump through full shields and health in the matter of a second, maybe two if you dont get a headshot, oh but wait, if you are doublepumping you can just go for the overkill and go for over 400 dmg (best case scenario) in the matter of 2 seconds, with the push of three buttons. Im sorry, i know a lot of people like the pump, but it will end up hurting the game in the long run if it stays on top of CQC like it is right now, and double pumping shouldn't be a thing at all, You want quick firing shot guns, Tac shotguns are in the game for a reason, Think they need less spread, maybe just a tad bit more damage, or a gentle buff to its fire rate? Send in a feedback form, or come on to reddit and make a post. And before you come in trying to justify double pump with ""oh it takes up two slots in your inventory, and its a more complex way to play"" The damage output it can do, for the little amount of work you have to do (Given you have to skill to do it halfway decently) far outways the drawbacks to doing it.

Not only that, walls are so delayed when coming up. This happens more rarely. I even have video proof of dying and a wall would come up after I’m dead when I put the wooden wall up. 

Also building stairs on mountains or slopes really suck too because sometimes it builds above even when you don’t aim above you causing you to fall to you death if you’re too high.

We ended up losing the game because the guy had 999 bullets in his legendary minigun (which I found out after the game after I added the guy to ask him WTF happened lmao). No matter how fast we built, we couldnt put up enough walls in time for us to get to cover, heal, or even take out a gun to shoot him. Meanwhile, he just ENES and held his mouse click button and unloaded ~700 bullets on us to win the game. Perhaps it's time to think about adding a cooldown, reload, or perhaps an overheat function to the minigun?

TLDR; Minigun is kind of strong and I think it needs a overheat, cooldown, or reload to have a little more counter play.",FortNiteBR

Hello! As many of you may be able to tell, I am not very familiar with Reddit, and I am not very active either. However, this is something that I feel would be a great addition to Fortnite:BR and i’m about to tell you why.

As a quick prelude, I play PS4 BR and I would consider myself a pretty good player. I have around 50 wins total and I have been playing on and off since console launch, a lot recently as my skill level has greatly improved.

Now, onto the main topic. The main reason that I believe more launch pads would be a good addition is that they are FUN! What isn’t fun about a launch pad? Ambushing a squad, barely edging out the storm with 4 HP, etc. Launch pads are one of my favorite things to find, as they are an extra tool in my pocket.

Now, there is one issue: They’re very rare! I find myself getting a launch pad 1 out of every 3 or 4 games. This sucks because nobody likes to die in the storm because they were running a hit late to loot, or being trapped and having no escape on the final circle. 

The solution: A more common drop rate on launch pads would keep the game more fun and fresh for people, eliminating many frustrating deaths and creating more exciting opportunities. 

Edit: My friend suggested that to counter balance a higher drop rate, the distance that you can travel could possibly be shortened or you could shoot them out easier. Just a suggestion from a friend if anyone thinks this could be too strong/hurt the game in any way.",FortNiteBR

The question I got is why are the layouts so bad? Why can we not have the ability to choose what we want? 

I have to sacrifice being able to crouch so I don’t have to click 3-5 times to get to a certain item that I want in both building and combat. Because the layout options are horrible. Either I am able to crouch but have to click 3-5 times to get to an item or I can’t crouch but I can go either direction when selecting an item.

Why can’t we bind things to the buttons we want? Why must we use the layouts given. 

R3 isn’t used IIRC, why can’t you at least bind R3 to crouching in the builder layout. (I think it’s called builder.)

However, there were a few things that weren't there that had part of the player base thirsting for more.

For me, with over 475 wins. There doesn't seem to be a special skin for players that are dedicated to the game and have been around since the beginning. The Level 70 Black Knight skin is badass, but started to lose it's appeal upon the realization that it's not even that rare to see. 

In the next season's Battlepass I'd like to see some things that have a win threshold to unlock them, or special challenges to unlock them that aren't - get 10 eliminations. I'm getting 100s of eliminations on the daily I want to see some unique cosmetics for players that pull of spectacular stunts. 

I saw someone snipe a guy from his glider the other day on this subreddit? Wouldn't it be cool if there was an exotic glider, like the dragon that was showcased the other day for players that have those sort of achievements.

I'm not trying to brag or anything, I just think there are a lot of cool ideas out there that could be implemented. The special gliders for hitting 100 wins, or even 1,000.

What I don't love is I still feel completely useless most of the time. I can survive if i play smart and hide from people, but I can't aim for shit and I sure as hell can't build and shoot like everyone seems to be able to do.

The problem is I'm playing against people who clearly have hundreds/thousands more games under their belt. It's just  completely one sided in any 1v1 situation. I've watched some pro streams and videos so I have an idea how the game is supposed to be played. I have my sensitivity and inputs setup.

The thing I have a problem with is that there's no ranked matchmaking, no MMR. I can load into a game and get my ass whipped by Ninja in a solo match. Like wtf am I supposed to do. That just deters any new person from wanting to learn the game bc of it's huge learning curve. Why would you not have a ranking system.. It's not like there's a lack of players. Finding a match would still be quick as hell.

A lot of games in 2017 didn't fill the void of enjoyment for me. Destiny 2 really let me down &amp; I just couldn't find a game to make me excited, heart racing, and tons of laughter. When Battle Royale came out for this game, my friend tried convincing me get it (before the game was free). I didn't want to spend the money on a game like this, honestly. It didn't seem that enjoyable. My buddy found someone in the world chat willing to gift me a key to play this. For those who don't know what that is, when you bought different packs for this game, the more you spent, the more keys you got to give friends. 

So, it took a couple games (and a lot of bitching) to get the hang of it. But by God I loved this game. I managed to get like 14 wins before it was free. More of my friends picked it up. Next thing I knew I was playing late, ruining my sleep schedule, etc.

*So why am I leaving?* If I love the game so much, why quit? Well, after 100s of wins, loses, and killing sprees. Nothing has managed to make me saltier than the pump action. Gosh damn does that gun make me toxic.. I scream, I get salty. 200HP &amp; great games lost in an instant. And with the possibilities of SBMM being added, I know my skill is high enough to get better players. Better players = more pumps = more salt. So instead of being mad and toxic, I'll take a break. Sooner or later maybe it'll get nerfed...Hopefully double pump is taken out somehow.

I know I'll get hate. I'm just another salt mine. Me being gone won't make EPIC fix my biased pet peeve. It's my choice. Just like it was to rush someone with a pump, buy skins &amp; stay up late.

So I'll be gone shortly. But it doesn't matter to you all. I'll still be lurking the Fortnite page to laugh at your clips or memes! Congratulate you on your victories or be your cheerleader to amazing clips. :)

Have a great day! *And get some one pumps for me*.

I consistently come across these glitches when playing, which always gets me killed if they occur during a fight:

Ramps auto rotating themselves, only fix is rotate 360 degrees.

Any item not able to be equipped, after landing, for 5-10 seconds, only fix is to switch between pickaxe and item until it's usable. 

Buildings not placing the first time you hit the trigger.

Schematics showing one building item in blue only to place a different piece. 

Scoped assault rifle's bullets consistently going left, right, and above the scope's cross-hair, even in close to medium range and both you and the target are standing still. Comparing this to the PC version, there is a huge difference. 

Sniper shot clearly going through another player's body. I have numerous videos of my friends and I missing when a player is afk and around 50m away. 

Rocket launcher doing no damage when the rocket itself hits the enemy's body and there is a built piece nearby. 

All shotguns damage are inconsistent. Shooting someone close range, aiming down sights, and clearly not missing only doing a random number between 8-24, even when hitting a critical to the head. 

Falling from the same height, same spot, only to take some damage one time, but not the other.

Thrown grenades landing at a players feet who is standing in the open, but they jump while the explosion occurs and takes no damage. 

Switching between items/buildings too quickly so that the number of times it switches doesn't add up to the number of times the button is clicked. 

The one-strike building pieces, such as boards nailed over a door, not breaking for a delayed period of time. Not allowing you to pass. 

Cross-hair disappearing, only fix is to hit any item not built by you with your pickaxe. 

Frames dropping only during close gunfights. Literally never dropped a frame (noticably) unless it was at the start of a close gunfight. 

This isn't a glitch but it's still annoying nonetheless. Having very counterintuitive button mappings. For example the map and inventory buttons switching between the different layouts. And having unbound buttons that you cannot utilize or customize. 

Plus not being able to zoom in on the map. How easy is it to make that happen?

I'd love to see these things among whatever else comes to light addressed and taken care of. It's almost sad how poor the game is on console compared to the PC version. ",FortNiteBR

Today I was disappointed to learn that next season I will not be able to use these VBucks to buy the pass. I was confused in the way that this was communicated in the store, so maybe you guys will just call me dumb, but it's seems kind of scummy that I won't be able to use the VBucks that I paid for to buy the pass.

I know that VBucks can be earned through Save the World and Epic want to make money, but I feel a bit cheated by this.

Figured out a small trick that you can do to gather resources without losing speed. Overall its a very small amount of resources you're getting, but since you lose next to no speed, doing it a lot can really add up.

The Method:

- Sprint 
- Take out pick axe
- Jump
- Swing at target material
- As soon as you press left click, switch to a different item
- Land, while still sprinting

Heres a video demonstration: [link](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/227979004)

Yes you get extremely small amounts of material each time, but doing it a bunch adds up pretty quick, and its really easy to perform without almost no reason not to.

Is it an exploit yes. So is rocket riding. But rocket riding’s not a problem is it?
“ROCKET RIDING DOESNT LET YOU DO MASSIVE DAMAGE!” But you know what does do massive damage besides double pump? Hitting your shots, more importantly aiming at the head and hitting your shots. Double pumping doesn’t give you extra health, it just lets you shoot pumps faster. I hear you saying “DOUBLE PUMPS DPS IS INSANE!” If you get hit with a perfect headshot from one pump the second pump isn’t even a factor. And don’t ry to say “pumps are op’ because they aren’t. That’s a whole other argument. 
Don’t send me your snarky comments yet we haven't talked about building. Building not only can get you the high ground but get this, IT BLOCKS BULLETS! Crazy I know. So not only can you block anything including double pumps with some walls, if you’re smart enough you’ll try to get the high ground. For you people who don’t build, high ground is very important and will get the win in a gun fight 99.99% of the time. 
So in conclusion hitting your headshots will not only let you do just as much damage as double pumping or sometimes even more. Building will also protect you from double pumps and when you get the high ground you will have an advantage that 5 pumps wont give you. Now you can send me you’re hate comments and try to justify nerfing the double pump.",FortNiteBR

Plus, we're both running around as sparkle specialists right now. I don't think she likes the Dark Knight one for that reason and she didn't want to purchase the lady version.

Hey everyone. As we all know, the idea of a skill based matchmaking system is the top controversy as of now. Much of the community seems to be opposed to the idea but for many different reasons. However, there are still some who do wish to see the feature in some form.

**EDIT:** Some people seem to think that we believe that this survey will be representative of the entire player base (even though this is stated in the survey itself). You're right, it isn't, but that doesn't mean we should just do nothing.

**EDIT 2:** We're at over 4,000 responses so far! Thanks for taking the time!

In order for everyone to better understand the overall community, we've decided to conduct a community survey. Raw results will be published in full, but we will also publish our own conclusions in an easier to digest form. All responses are anonymous so please, speak your mind!

We intend to use the data to help the community better understand *exactly* what is wanted, and hopefully begin the path towards creating an even better version of the game we have now. Remember, compromise is key! We can't all be happy, but we can at least try.

A lot of people have suggested forcing the pump to require the pump animation, instead of allowing it to be animation cancelled.  This would effectively nerf double pumps, which would still be able to get two shots off, but would then have to go through the pump animations.  However, this would also make pump shotguns in general lack any kind of weapon switching synergy with other guns, and even make transitioning between pumping and building (the common way to use a single pump) difficult, because swapping to build mode would still require you to pump the shotgun after coming out of it.  Overall this change would slow down the pace of any kind of pump playstyle or creativity, and make the weapon feel awkward and cumbersome to use at best.  

However, there is a much better way to go about limiting pumps to a 2 shot burst without touching how the weapon feels to use when just taking one.  Currently, there exists a mechanic that produces diminishing returns on jumps.  If a player spams their jump key too much in succession, the height of their jumps rapidly decreases until they are barely leaving the ground at all.  Waiting a moment before pressing the jump key resets the jump to its original height.  

# The Solution

Epic should apply this concept to weapon switch speed when switching between copies of a weapon (disregarding weapon rarity).  So if a player has two pumps in their inventory, they may fire and switch, but the penalty will immediately kick in and lower their switch speed if they try to switch back to the original pump, and lower further if they try to continue switching between weapons.  This will only apply to duplicates of weapons in your inventory, and will disregard rarity (so even if you have a grey and green pump they count as the same).  

This accomplishes several important things:

1. The double pump is limited to a 2 shot burst, as most people have agreed is acceptable. This prevents players from threatening with an effective 10 shell pump magazine, and putting out far more pressure than any other close range weapon is capable of. 

2.  Because the switch speed penalty only applies to duplicates of an item, switching speed and weapon swapping strats for multiple different weapons (pop a quick snipe, launch a rocket and switch to AR to pepper a building) are not penalized at all, maintaining a high skill ceiling.  

3.  Although the switch speed penalty applies to weapon duplicates, it does not limit whether a player can carry multiple of the same weapon, which can be important in squads if you need to take a weapon to a friend.  This also means similar dupe weapon strats (double rockets, double bolt, double revolvers) are also able to execute a 2 shot burst, but no more beyond that.  

4. The single pump remains untouched, and does not receive a nerf in any way.  Because this method does not make the pumping animation mandatory, the weapon flow maintains its fluid feel and synergy with swapping quickly between building and firing the weapon.  ",FortNiteBR

The primary reason i do not agree with microtransactions in Fortnite is because this game is still in early access. I believe that a game should be released in early access to strictly clear up bugs and multiple other issues, not to sell micro transactions in a game you KNOW has flaws.

I dont believe Epic is doing this currently, but i dont want them to begin using the title ""early access"" as an excuse to mess up on anything they want and still make profit from it. Previous games have done this such as ARK and 7 Days to Die. ARK began in  October 2014 and was officially released in August 2017. Even after finishing early access, ARK still had many performance issues and STILL sold microtransactions during the early access. 7 Days to Die began early access in 2013 and hasnt even finished yet while still charging you at least $40 to buy it WITH its multiple performance issues. Knowing this, it makes you question if the money you spend in early access is actually being used to improve the game.

You also have to remember that an early access game can be discontinued, but i will admit, i do not see Epic not finishing Fortnite. I trust the fact that they will finish development. 

Some of you may be thinking, ""Well the money helps them develop the finished game."" That may be true, but whos saying the money is going towards that? They have already started making completely new locations and weapons for the game along with new cosmetics while the base game isnt even complete yet. Why is the money going towards completely new items when we are still in early access??? Im not saying iv read somewhere that it isnt going towards development, but it is something to think about. And yes, the items you can buy are all just cosmetics, but honestly. Would you rather have them ALL achievable for free or have to pay for them? I think the obvious choice is everyone wants a way to get them all for free.

Now please dont take everything I have presented as FACTS. I dont think there is anything wrong about being a sceptic especially during this time in gaming.  If you have spent money on the game, then i can understand that. I dont think youre a horrible person for buying something. Im purely just saying that having microtransactions in an unfinished game seems a little weird.

SUMMARY: Epic putting microtransactions in an early access game is a bit unneeded.",FortNiteBR

And I gotta agree that from a casual players standpoint, it's exciting to know that you're playing against players that are probably way better than you. Gives you that adrenaline rush and makes you anxious. But from the stand point of someone who regularly wins games / gets 10+ kills, SBMM would be a real improvement.  
Lately I haven't been really immersed in to the games. A lot of times I just run around and rush / kill most of the enemies I see. Especially Duos / Squads with my other friends get boring real fast because you easily notice when a squad consists of new / bad players and when a squad consists of actual good players. And you barely encounter real good players.  Having a *real* fight, with building tower high buildings and outplaying the enemy, is really uncommon for me. And that's not because I think I'm way better than most people ,it's just because you barely encounter really good players. It's 70% bad / casual players and a top 10% that know how to build. It has come to a point that I queue solo games at the same time as my friends just so we can face each other eventually and have this big amazing fight. It's what makes this game fun for me.  
Having SBMM would drastically increase the amount of good players in games, which means good players will be challenged more often, which is the reason a lot of us play the game anyway.",FortNiteBR

I didn't deserve it.

I dropped near Flush Factory and only found a gray Assault Rifle and some meds. Unfortunately for me, the circle was at the other side of the map, so pretty much the entire match was me running from the circle, no time to loot, no one to fight. 

Some time later, I was in the top 4. I managed to run up on two of them fighting each other and I killed them both as they didn't notice me. I Geared up on a blue AR and green Tac Shotgun and noticed last second that the last guy used a launch pad and was headed right towards me. I hit him twice with the Tac and he scrambled for cover, throwing up walls and stairs, he had the height advantage. So I swapped to my AR, waiting for him to peak.

But he didn't, he jumped down and tried to finish me with a Shotgun. I frantically flicked to the side and pre-fired hoping to land an RNG shot, but it was too late…

He switched to his RPG. Not wanting to get hit point blank I switched to my Tac again and jumped, but before I could fire he'd already blasted the ground beneath us. I should have died.

But I didn't. By some miracle, he inflicted self-damage first, killing himself before me. It was over, *'Victory Royale!'* was on the screen. I had won my first solo game! I was excited, I mean, I should have been, right? ""Anything it takes to win,"" surely that should have been a good enough reason. But as time went on, I felt more and more unimpressed with my win. 90% of the match was spent running from the storm, I snaked two kills and the last guy blew himself up. My first win, wasn't really a ""win.""

So, that's why I'm here, Epic, I'm requesting you remove my singular solo win in hopes that when I get my *real* first win, it'll be more deserved.",FortNiteBR

The game has outplay mechanics which is what makes it better than it's competitors but when it comes down to a normal gunfight, it should take skill and not luck",FortNiteBR

I might get downvoted, because for some weird reason, the SMG has been the most underrated weapon on this subreddit since the start. But I can assure you, in the right hands, this gun is absolutely devastating and I use it regularly when I want to be in someones face and overwhelm my targets with a shower of bullets. Most of you probably tried the SMG and realised the horrible bloom and low bullet dmg it does and thought it sucks. But has anyone tried to point that thing into someones head and see what it does? If you do it right, they can't even swap to their shotgun before they're sent to the lobby. It's actually insane and extremely satisfying. If this isn't enough, here are some unique aspects that make the SMG stand out from other weapons:

* Highest dps of all weapons (a pretty cool stat by itself)
* Hands down the best weapon for finishing off low hp targets
* Requires smooth tracking of targets more than any other gun - a nice alternative to point and click
* Encourages hyper-aggressive close range playstyle (even more than shotguns)
* One of the two guns that can effectively counter turtling/wall spamming
* It's FUN to use when you realise what it's capable of

So what's the problem?

The bullet spread is much too big even for a close range weapon. If there are long range, medium range and short range weapons, I consider the SMG to be point blank, it's that bad. So instead of buffing the dmg, it needs 2 things.

A slight tweak to the ridiculous bloom so it becomes great at close range and not completely useless at medium range, and the epic variant needs to spawn much more often. I swear [the rarity](https://i.imgur.com/eHmxC8X.png) of that thing rivals the golden scar. Do that and I'm positive people are going to start picking it up and the SMG meme will die in a fire.

So again, I beg you Epic, please don't put the SMG away. I LOVE it. It fills a unique niche and supports a playstyle which no other weapon does. Otherwise it's going to be a real shame and I'm probably going to shed a few manly tears, no joke. I hope this gets at least some healthy discussion before the cut is made and solidifies the shotgun meta even more.",FortNiteBR

I’m suggesting new emotes (or something like emotes) of all the items, ammo and materials in the game that you can send other teammates, signaling your need. 

Some options:
Option 1:
-regular emotes, like the ones we have now. 
-Every weapon/ammo type/material in the game available. 
-spam whatever thing you need

Option 2:
-new emotes, brings up a little notification next to the list of people who got knocked down/died
-same as the first option as in it brings up a menu with all weapon types+ammo+materials in the game.
-cool down of 1 or 2 minutes so people won’t spam “scar” all the time.

So what do you think? The menu will be kinda like the regular items menu, maybe it’ll open when pressing the left/right/down button on console, as the up button is already taken by the item menu/map.

I also think that there should be a notification whenever someone pins a place on the map so other people would know where he wants to go. Not a big one, just a small one in the left corner so it wouldn’t intrude.

If anyone in the UK on Plusnet is having this issue, here's how I resolved it.
Grab the ""handy reference card"" with you route details on, or look at the back of your router.
Log in to your router (open a browser on any device and type in the Router Address - usually 192.168.1.254)
Go to advanced settings.
Sign in with your router password.
After agreeing to the warning, change the DNS server from Auto to Google. You could try the others I suppose but this is what worked for me.
Try logging in!
Hope it helps

Everyone claims it, I play for it but for the life of me I can't describe why it works. In some games it makes sense because you can't aim straight down but that's not the case for Fortnite. I suppose the biggest advantage is that you can make headshots easier but then you expose your head to the enemy also. There is the third person advantage but that only works if the lower player doesn't build ceilings to cover themselves.  
  
The more I think about it, it honestly feels less and less important, whereas everyone claims it to be the end all be all tactic. Obviously if you can achieve high ground, go for it, but if you have to fight someone over the high ground, seems like it would just be better to let them have it and try to take out their supports.

When the battle royale version came out, I was playing PUBG on PC. My 2 closest friends were playing other games at the time cause they didnt have a PC to play with me. Needless to say, we all jumped on Fortnite cause it came out on console. Unfortunately, my 1 friend played on XB1 while 2 of us played on PS4.

That didn't stop us for talking about it every day. We'd text each other plays we made, wins we got, and clips we'd find on this subreddit. Our routine became work, go to someones house, drink, and watch some streamers. One night, my friend who played on XB1 came over and we took turns playing solo, and every time we'd get a kill, the other person would have to take a shot lmao.

Christmas came around and my friend and I finally decided to buy our XB1 friend a PS4. We bought him a PS4 just so we could play Fortnite with him. The minute he realized what it was he said ""No way, we're going to get so many dubs."" We did actually get a good amount of wins haha, which he was obviously super hype about.

I got my first duo win with him about 2 weeks ago. It was an awesome game, off the top of my head we had 10+ kills between us. We ended the last team but auto rifling the other teams base just kinda hoping we had more bullets than they had wood. I saved a video of that win.

The next day, my friend suddenly passed away due to a heart attack in his sleep.

I'm writing this cause of that clip I saved from the night before that happen. He wasn't someone who liked to be in pictures or videos a lot, so with this clip, I can hear his voice whenever I want. I can hear him laugh, cheer, cuss, ask if I have a sniper, all of that. We usually play in squads, but that clip is just of us two, which is why it's even more special to me. I'm going to be going back to this clip for the rest of my life. He was the first real friend I ever made, and while he won't be at my wedding or meet my kids, I'll be able to remember him exactly how I want to remember him; a happy, excited, and slightly toxic best friend.

So Epic, thank you. I wouldn't have this without Fortnite. Thank you for making it so damn fun, thank you for making it accessible to so many people, thank you for continuing to improve it, thank you for everything. While I'll probably make my way to other games in the future, I'll always be coming back to this clip and will remember Fortnite in turn.

TL;DR - RIP McSwervington, and thank you Epic for making the most memorable game I'll ever play.

However, Devil's Advocate, SBMM could be good if it's used broadly to eliminate poor matchmaking for those on the extremes. That is, if it's used to stop those who can barely walk matching against those with top quartile win rates.


[Take the population as a distribution of skill from bad to good.](https://i.imgur.com/eS2jhce.png) If each match has a specified skill range (as in normal match-making) it can still work fine if it's broad enough. Unless you're on either end of the spectrum you will place randomly in each match, i.e. not much difference except you won't be fighting top / bottom quartiles unless you're in that half of the distribution.


**TL;DR** Use SBMM broadly so extremely bad &amp; extremely good players are buffered ~~form~~ from each other by the rest of the player base.

Just hear me out guys this is my first post ever on Reddit but I feel I might have an answer...

First: Get rid of the green tactical shotgun, add a blue pump... Stick with me here... It's honestly painful to see 4 different variants of the tactical shotgun but only 2 pumps. I feel if you add a blue pump and remove the green tac, it will even out the playing field a bit...

Second: Add a delay of some sort between switching weapons and firing... Easier said than done I'm sure but please we are begging you. 

Lastly: We can all agree that the pump is a strong weapon but we can't get rid of it because it is viable on it's own... But for those of us that don't double pump, the tactical shotguns don't stand a chance. We need more balance with close quarters gun fights... Not whoever double pumps wins.

This makes no sense to me, BR could still keep a casual mode for anyone to play and incorporate a skill based matchmaking mode. I honestly can’t see this game growing much more or lasting too long if there is nothing to play for.

The battle pass is okay, but it limits it to two challenges a day. There is virtually nothing to unlock. Adding a more competitive side to this game would make this game 10x better. It would give people something to play and grind for.

If it is too “stressful” to play in a competitive mode stuck to casual where ranking wouldn’t matter or be judged.

Please Epic, for the long term well being of this game, add skill based matchmaking. It can really only help.",FortNiteBR

If they introduce SBMM everyone will be on the same skill level. Imo, this removes some of the battle royale aspect. I loved the fact that you don't really know who you're messing with until you get into a fight.

With SBMM, as soon as you get into a decent skill level, I'm highly sure that almost every enemy you see will end up in a 2+ minute build battle.

Not saying building sucks. But imagine having a building fight 10 timss in a game. Sounds like some exhausting shit.

So yeah, SBMM will just make the game stale and repetitive, since you're only facing your calibre of skill, no higher no less. Every single game.",FortNiteBR

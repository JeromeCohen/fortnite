- Switching weapons/items takes longer based on your ping. This includes switching to buildmode from a weapon and switching to a weapon from buildmode
- Switching between traps types takes longer based on your ping
- Getting into edit mode takes longer based on your ping

I'm not exaggerating about the game being unplayable. Even at a casual level it's still bad. The only difference between competitive play and casual is that casuals will simply die/make mistakes and not be able to explain what went wrong:

For example, a casual player has 100 ping today instead of his usual 10. He has his pickaxe out and presses &lt;ramp&gt; followed pretty quickly by &lt;place&gt;. This fails because his game still thinks he has his pickaxe out, so pressing the &lt;place&gt; button just swings his pickaxe. A casual player doesn't stop to play with building to figure out that there is some new delay for pulling out build mode that wasn't there 1 hour ago when he had 10 ping. I've made a [video on a 300 ping region to demonstrate this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8nk0k0/oops_you_didnt_wait_enough_between_ramp_and_place/).

In both cases (casual vs competitive), these issues are still making a huge difference.

Example #2: You just eliminated someone and want to place a wall because you need his loot because you're out of ammo. You have a gun out and do &lt;wall&gt; &lt;place&gt;. This fails because you have 100 ping and you didn't sit there and wait 100+ms for your game to think you have your wall out. You may even turn around completely and assume your wall was placed and get screwed. A low ping player can do this reliably almost instantly in contrast.

Example #3: You need to make a small ramp with a launch pad to escape the storm. You have 100 ping. You switch to build mode (100+ms), build 3 ramps and a floor, then select spike trap. You press the trap switch button to switch to launchpad (100+ms + 100-200ms for human reaction time; a low ping player has 0 reaction time because he just knows he can press the trap switch button followed by &lt;place&gt; and it will work). You die in the storm because you sat around waiting for these delays. [Video of slow ping based trap switching](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7rlahb/can_we_fix_the_huge_delay_for_switching_trap_type/)

Really I can list in detail about 20 issues that result from just the 3 bullet points at the top of my post, but it will take a few pages. I wrote a bit more in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8nk0k0/oops_you_didnt_wait_enough_between_ramp_and_place/dzw0w9x/).",FortNiteBR

You may be thinking this is a great nerf and deserved, yeah it is bu it isn't enough. The gun may be much weaker now and doesn't one shot kill you but none of these nerfs to the shotguns actually matter.

This is because of the Double Pump strategy, this ""feature"" is the reason why the game isn't much fun anymore in my opinion everybody had a variety of weapons to choose from but now its just everybody using a different colored shotgun depending on their RNG Luck.

They use a large variety of shotguns in their load out. Very commonly i always see people using 2 - 3 Green or Blue pumps and will charge you and shoot you once and take about 70% of your health and finish you off with another shotgun.

People will comment on this post ""Just get good, not that hard"". No, this isn't balanced. Why is a shotgun used 90% of the time and only rifles being used to break platforms or shoot a guy slight distance away. Also why remove different weapons just because the community complained that they couldn't get a Gold Scar or a shotgun from a chest so they remove a very good weapon such as the Crossbow from the game for no reason.

You know this is a problem and so do you Epic Games but you'll not want it to change it because you're a part of the problem and use shotguns to save yourself rather than your skill, brain and building skill to outplay the opponent.

Yes before you complain yeah i know shotguns are meant for close combat but when they're the only weapon used even in mid range combat there is a problem.

**Why I think the Blockbuster skin will be a retro sci-fi themed robot outfit**

(Think those big, clunky costumes made from tinfoil and the likes.)

Weak Supporting Evidence:

* The silhouette looks kinda like a robot, with a visor and shoulder pads.
* There's a graffiti sci-fi robot on the Wet Paint glider, this season's victory umbrella.

Strong(er) Supporting Evidence:

* With a retro sci-fi intro to the cinematic and a retro sci-fi themed trail, there isn't any kind of retro skin in sight...
* The comet in dusty is beginning to break apart, and it seems there's a person-sized electronic capsule inside. It also looks like it could fit into a sci-fi comic book from the 50s and/or 60s.",FortNiteBR

I've been a player in the community since the start of October 2016 and nothing has ground my gears more than this right here.
———————————————————————
With the inconsistency along with the nerf in damage of the shotguns it's made it a matter of luck not skill anymore. The playing around with shotgun damage is getting ridiculous.. Yes shotguns are always going to be one of the hardest weapons to find a middle ground with when it comes to damage output, although Fortnite is taking it out of hand. I feel as though prior to the last update the shotguns damage were at a peek, it may of still had some flaws especially with point blank shots although I could still go into a shotgun fight confident I would win, but with the most recent update with the nerf of the shotguns there feels like there is no longer a middle ground what so ever. I'm hitting point blank shots with pumps and heavy's for even less than the notorious 9 and being beat by common tacs.. So in my eyes it's gotten to a point where it just feels like a matter of who is the game going to favour when it comes to damage output? Because I definitely can't go into shotgun fights anymore with confidence I'll win because the the only consistency with the shotguns now are how they keep downscaling.. Epic please, if anything just set damage back to how it was in Version 1.60 and stop trying to cater to the younger audience who aren't so good when it comes to double pumping and build off's because a very large majority of the player base love the competitive nature of the game and at the end of the day it comes down to practise, not making it easier for others who don't put in the effort to get better. Pretty much I'm trying to say it sucks to see this amazing game go in the direction it's headed because of all these nerfs.. :/ 
I'd love to hear your guys thoughts about the shotguns after the 1.61 update because it's definitely had a major impact on my play style more than ever 😅",FortNiteBR

ar ghost peeking was patched in a blink of an eye, but somehow sniper ghost peeking is completely OK

sniper battles are a fucking joke especially in a end game, that's why i almost never use it

jetpack is also a bullshit I fucking love building up to someone just to hear him blazing that shit and that's when a fucking guessing game begins because horizontal sound in this game is a so fucked for a game that makes 300m a month so i'm forced to box myself if i don't locate enemy in time, in fear of getting 1 pumped

either way i have to use much more materials to gain highground/cover than my fucking enemy and yet you guys call this balanced? of course jetpack is not that great if noob uses it.. but even noob can land lucky pump head shot if head is all he sees from the highground he gets for free

this shit is even worse in a end game

they brought back double pump, using 1 pump puts you at a disadvantage now becuase of dmg nerf and how slow it shoots compare to 2x pump so you have no choice but play with 2 pumps.. lol

spike traps deal 150 dmg.. now what a joke that is for something that requires no skill to use. This shit makes me paranoid whenever i enter a building and it takes more time than it should to clear it

unreal engine was never meant to be used in a 100 pvp.. and you can see it in desincs and shitty tickrate - especially at the beginning of a match and enemy phasing through walls is still a thing

you can tell this mode was put together fast in response to a market..

TBH i know why it's still so popular and that's because of appeal it has to young players but let me tell you.. if it comes to technical aspects of this game and how poorly this game is balanced i wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard's take on battle royale killed fortnite just like fortnite is killing PUBG right now

As for the SMG/Pistol elims, I find it difficult to find them early game anyway, and it’s difficult to kill people with them anyway as the meta is after all shotguns. I propose we replace these chore challenges with more fun challenges and more achievable without actually going out of your way to do them. Things like Outlive Opponents, Search Chests and various other items should stay, and we should add things like Damage to Enemy Structures, and Consume Apples/Mushrooms. Even Ride a Cart.

So I've been playing fortnite for about two months now, but I've only started getting into it and playing seriously over the last two weeks. Usually I would only ever play if my friends asked me to join their squad, and I would average 0-3 kills a game while they would be getting 7-15 each. I used to play cod a lot, so my aim is decent and I had a basic level understanding of the game. But I couldn't build, I panicked and sprayed in every gunfight, I had no awareness, my reaction time was abysmal, my decision making was woeful, I had little knowledge on the game and I was almost always an easy kill for others. 

Fast forward to last night - I played 8 solo matches, getting a minimum 7 kills in each, and my final game was a 14 kill win. I can build confidently, my aim is controlled, my awareness is much better, I don't get nervous and I'm starting to look like a better player. 

I started my training routine two weeks ago. I don't play video games much and I'm usually doing things throughout the day, but I forced myself to play at least 20-30 minutes every night. Here's what I did in those sessions:


First, I needed something to counter my nervousness. Every gun fight I became an anxious mess, I could feel my heart beating through my chest and sweat beads on my arms. So, I created a playlist of music I like on Spotify (I'm on PlayStation), lowered the Spotify volume to half and kept game volume high. This had two effects. The first was that due to the music, I could only hear footsteps that were right next to me. That's a disadvantage right? Yet, it improved my awareness exponentially. I never once got shot in the back because I was always looking around, since I couldn't be lazy and rely on hearing. Second, and I can't really explain this, but it calmed my nerves a lot. When I had my music playing I never panicked in gunfights or build battles. I was able to think and aim calmly. I think the music made me feel safer or more comfortable. 

Second, I never once dropped tilted. I know common advice is to drop tilted to get experience, but what I found is that I got completely overwhelmed and killed before I gained any experience. I dropped salty most often. 

Third, I switched to builder pro. This made a massive difference for my building. Normally I would get killed because I would take so long scrolling through the building options. But with builder pro, building became muscle memory to me and I didn't need to worry about scrolling through the options.  

Fourth, I always kept moving, especially jumping. It made me feel like I was gaining momentum and speed and it helped my reaction time. It kept my fingers itching and ready, so when I got shot I was able to turn and start building quickly. 

Fifth, when in a build battle, if I could see that my opponent was a faster builder than me, I would try to outsmart him instead. So rather than build up and up, I would edit a door, build floors and go around, or drop down to the ground and go up his tracks. Sometimes fast builders lose track of where you are. 

Finally, I played ultra aggressive. Unless I had an overwhelming disadvantage, I challenged every gunfight. I didn't care about wins, I wanted kills and experience. If I heard gunfire, I would sprint over to it. I was like a stray dog with autism, I chased fucking everything. Sometimes I got pinched but I didn't care. Challenging every gunfight aggressively forces you to be faster, this was how the bulk of my improvement came. 

Anyways, I hope this can help some people.

In my opinion this game will drop during this fall when red dead redemption comes out, black ops 3 comes out, and even when battlefield comes out. All because they will all have battle royal modes.

Okay here me out, when skins get leaked they get released that fortnight/week. Royale bomber got leaked about 3-4 weeks ago and we still haven’t had it arrive to the shop. It also does not have a pickaxe or glider leaked along side it which all the recently featured shop skins have had. 

Normally Fortnite leaked skins release Friday and Sunday (here in Australia anyways) the weekly challenges come out Thursday. Because we got flytrap today and all the leaked skins have been sold (expect Royale bomber) there is no day between today and Thursday where they release new skins into the shop.

So this leads me to believe, Royale bomber will be the blockbuster skin.

I sure as hell hope not, but it kinda makes sense doesn’t it? What do you think? Thanks.

But mainly I'm wondering what you guys hope is going to be announced in regards to Fortnite, especially Battle Royale! Here's my wishlist; 

* Save the World official launch, AKA free to play for everyone like BR! With founders finally getting their skins and stuff in BR 
* Fortnite for Android! I might be a bit biased because I just got a Samsung Galaxy S9 as an upgrade from my iPhone 6, so I've yet to try Fortnite mobile. I'd mainly use it to poke around in the shop and maybe attempt some challenges that are easy to do. 
* More word on the eSports/Tournament side of Fortnite. I'm a very competitive player, and right now all I can go for is wins and kills in the various modes. A solo showdown for all 3 modes would be exciting, and it would be awesome if it were semi\-permanent 
* The game stepping out of Beta and into full release; I would like to see BR/StW be fully released because to me they feel like fully fleshed out games and have been in development for a very long time.

That's all for me! What do you guys hope to hear? Of course this is all speculation and none of this may be announced, but this is what I'm hoping for anyway. ",FortNiteBR

Pump: Slow, max headshot 215.
Tac: Fast, max headshot 137
Heavy: Medium, max headshot 173

So here is why I chose the numbers that I did:

Pump 215, The one pump is a glorious thing that requires skill, and precision which makes it worthwhile.

Tac 137, If you get a headshot and a strong body shot, the person should definitely be dead, but if you get a headshot and 2 foot shots, it should be close.

Heavy 173, If you get a headshot with the heavy, it should definitely take out anyone with less than 150, but if someone has 175 or above it should take a headshot and a medium body shot.

Additions:
1. Custom Matchmaking- Most people in the community would love to have custom games. Being able to hop in private matches with your friends would be a blast.
2. Cosmetic Item Trading- Being able to trade skins with your friends would be a good quality of life feature.
3. ACR Assault Rifle- The addition of the Famas was awesome so adding another automatic rifle is next, could be blue/purple rarity.
4. Ranked Matchmaking- The showdown playlist was a good step in the right direction but I'd like to see them expand on that. 

Remove:
1. Magnum pistol
2. Mini-gun
3. Hand cannon pistol
4. Burst rifle
5. Grenade launcher
6. Clinger Grenades
7. C4 explosives
8. Common Pistol
9. Silenced submachine gun
10. Bush consumable

Change:
1. Shooting Model- Bloom is a terrible shooting mechanic and needs to be changed ASAP. It should be replaced with hit-scan(perfectly accurate) aim. To balance out the accuracy they could implement a slight recoil and/or damage drop off which is already in place. 
2. Damage Trap- I have two thoughts here. One is to reduce the damage to 95 since I 
don't think traps should be able to 1 shot players. My second thought is to make traps that have been placed my eliminated players defective
3. Materials- I think material gain should be similar to blitz. Decreasing the amount gained from floor drops does nothing. Players that want to build will just farm more. Increase material gain by 50% so there more focus on gunfights and less on farming.

* (1) Break their wall and replace it with your own, then you can edit and kill them
* (2) Spam shoot at them &amp; hope some rounds slip through
* (3) Spam shoot at them while running at their wall / standing on top of their box and try to slip through
* (4) Clingers, C4, Splodes

If I have (4), I just use them &amp; win the fight, of course.

If you are facing a decent player, #'s 2 &amp; 3 are not possible if they just spam build. You can spam shoot all day at a good player and they'll just keep rebuilding. Particularly if they rotate their ramps and / or put pyramids on top of their box, these don't work.

(1) is the pro suggestion people always give, that is high-skill and fool-proof. However, if the player in the box is decent (which, if they weren't I would have already done (2) or (3)), it is not possible to replace with your own wall faster than they can build. This is because you have to a) knock down the wall and then b) press ""B"" and then c) build a wall, while the player in the structure just has to spam build wall.

Is there a counter to this that I'm missing?

If not - please upvote for visibility, because I'm running into this more and more and it seems to not really have a counter. It's a really poor gameplay experience. I think there should be some sort of counter to this or it'll become more and more prevalent particularly on console.",FortNiteBR

The reason for it is pretty simple. In 50v50 we can have fun and do whatever we want without screwing our stats. Also in 50v50 half of your team donesn't die to the storm as they do in 20v20 x5.

50v50 is like ""practise mode"" for players. We can practise our sniper skills, shotgun skills or whatever ever we want. 50v50 is much faster paced than 20v20 x5 is.

50v50 should take its place over 20v20 x5 aleardy. The gamemode should also stay permament.

The plan is to launch squad games as a team, jump from the ship at the last moment, instantly use gliders, wait for the first zone and land on a tree in the middle of the zone, then get out when the game is almost finished, and try to win the game. If you loose, no worries, the Placement XP plus the survival time XP is already great. If you win, that's even more XP to get. This technique, while not very morally correct, has proved very useful to me already, i would most likely be only approx level 50 without it, with me getting around 676 XP each game.

I decided to go for a heal off which I presumably lost since I only had 1 campfire. After checking the replay I saw that the person RedAttick_YT left the game while being in the waiting lobby, presumably making it impossible for him to win the game right? apparently not, after another look on his TRN profile it seems like this didn't only happen in my lobby but multiple recent matches where he wins without having any kills. This is obviously a gamebreaking bug and it would be horrible to see it be exploited more than it already is.

The steep jump from Level 55 which is totally doable to Level 80 which is very difficult if you don’t play constantly for hours non stop is total bs in my opinion. 

The Level 80 award could’ve included a glider for Omega as well as the lights but instead, the grinding just gives you lights to wrap the look together.

And let’s face it: everyone wants a completed Omega look but not everyone has that much free time to play this game for hours upon hours.

So my hope is that they can have mercy and possibly either lower the level requirement to get the lights, change Leveling up back to how it was in Season 3, every weekend offer Double XP opportunity’s or offer XP Boosters in the shop.

I know that there should be some things in the game you should have to work for but I think the grind to get even halfway to 80 (Level 62 ffs) is enough. Maybe make Carbides lights at 60 and Omegas at 65?

I understand the mindset of making rarity put more damage out, but make the headshot multiplier 2.0 on the pump and leave the damage the same, and buff the heavy, while also leaving it at 2.0 headshot multiplier.

After two days, the highest headshot that I've hit with a blue pump is 164. If you get a headshot with the common SMG it does 32 damage, and sprays a hell of a lot faster than the pump does. 

Double pump is not viable anymore and Pump Tac does not put out nearly the amount of damage the common SMG does. If you get 3 headshots with the SMG, which is easy to do, they are dead. 

I'm aware that adapting to the new meta is what I should do, either running Pump SMG, Tac SMG or Heavy SMG is the ""appropriate"" thing to do, but after playing with Double Pump and Pump SMG since before Season 2, I don't think such an abrupt change was necessary. I proprose that either the SMG is nerfed or the shotguns are buffed.

Epic needs to do something about this. I like grinding, but it feels unfair. Not to mention the fact that people who buy the battlepass at the start are much more favored to get lvl 80 a lot sooner (all the battlepass bonuses right at the start of the season)-and just because I don´t want to spend 100+ dollars on something that can be unlocked with regular progression, my grind is much slower than people who spend that much money.

The Nuclear Missile, the various Omega and Carbide bases are props for the movie. 2.) The meteors were *not* props, director's notes say that they were unplanned and lucky to live. Meaning also... 3.) The gigantic meteor that created Dusty Divot and the screenshot of pod I found inside it are canon to the storyline, they aren't props, and the pod will probably kick off Season 5 somehow. 4.) The various tri\-toed dinosaur footprints are also not props. They got there somehow unnoticed \[likely when the movie was being shot\]. 5.) This leaves the Blockbuster skin to be four things: a.) Just an unrelated character who either was in the movie as an extra or was the director in the first place; b.) Is the character that is inside the pod in the meteor. In this case, it hasn't been revealed because of the fact that the Fortnite Movie Team will probably shoot it in a second movie, and it'll go wrong somehow \[or it'll just begin Season 5's unknown theme, the story will carry on from Week 7\-10, then he'll be either ""defeated"" or ""victorious"" and then patch 5.0 will start\]; c.) The ""leaks"" about Leviathan\-related storyline are somehow true, and Blockbuster is either Leviathan's escort or is some sort of advanced Leviathan creature \[probably the least likely\]; d.) My personal favorite, the pod inside the meteor is a time machine, and the Blockbuster is a time\-traveler, he went to the prehistoric age, and somehow accidentally brought dinosaurs with him, and he might let us use the time machine to either have static season theme of being in a prehistoric time, OR there could be game\-modes where you could *choose* to either be in the far past, the past, the present, the future, and far future. Homebase would just be in the Divot Research Area, in the time machine, and modes like 50v50 or Sniper Shootout would be branches of game\-modes in different time periods of your choosing. Battle Pass would have different costumes from all throughout history, without one strict time theme. Really far\-fetched, but we can only speculate :) What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

I think they need to make rifles more like in cs, where you can strafe and accurately fire in that split second when you change directions, so you don't have to stay still for a second before your gun is accurate. That would make medium range and longer range a little more viable. As of now, you basically have to stand still to shoot, you can strafe around in between shots but when you want to fire at med range, you have to come to a complete stop for a little bit longer than you should have to.

Personally I would like to see top players/teams play against each other without any special rules and see who comes out victorious. Who is the last man standing? So instead of making new rules maybe add some nice bonuses for top plays/performances kind a like UFC Performance of the night.

And that is the nerfs to the lama’s and the nerfs to the floor resource drops. Why did these need a nerf? They didnt have not one negative impact on the game. The big thing here is the people that totally rely and are carried by using two shotguns. Its just way too fast and way too powerful really using any two weapons of the same type is too powerful and is bad for the game. For instance if you use two rocket launchers all you have to do is connect twice and its an easy kill and because you have two one comes right after the other so theres no time to react. Same with shotguns however they are not as damaging but two good hits is all it takes and again because you have two the next shot comes significantly faster and gives near impossible time to react. The devs need to focus on things that actually are game breaking instead of nerfing things like lamas and floor resource drops that didnt need any nerfing at all. And lets not forget people are still walking through your ramps and walls. A prime example of another good game with really bad developers. ,FortNiteBR

Kept doing this over and over for the entire res timer - the person died....

why?

Another team member died to the storm but managed to crawl back inside - only to have another person use impulse grenade to push them back into the storm and then build around them thus killing them.

Since when did this game became such a sad display of toxicity?

I am at a loss why a team would go against their own.

We need to be able to report other players and submit videos - this shite should be bannable",FortNiteBR

Mid build battle I should be able to hit a higher damage shot with my pump if I’m carrying a single shotgun, but now I’m forced to double pump.

If this new damage nerf is meant to stop double pumping being a massive problem in 1v1 shotgun battles then it’s not working. A better idea would be to revert the damage nerf change the time to shoot for shotguns but keep the time switch between shotguns only (not with other weapons) which then makes double pumping and actual viable option but also keeping a single pump/shotgun a viable option aswell.",FortNiteBR

If you don't like their game, simply don't play it. If you don't like how little damage pumps do, don't use them. If you don't like bounce pads, don't pick them up. If you don't like the game and the people who play it, don't play the game.

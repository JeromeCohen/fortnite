Just a casual player here jumping on for a few  hours on the weekends. 50v50 is the only game mode I enjoy. It's fun and  hectic and I learn more from it than the other game modes. Bums me out  whenever it is removed. Teams of 20 isn't the same. Just feels like a  larger version of squads.

So Epic, if you're listening, PLEASE make 50v50 a permanent game mode. That way there will be something for everyone to enjoy.",FortNiteBR

I think it really kills the way build battles play out and it's super difficult to approach someone wearing a jetpack in a build battle. Most of the time, I have to just box myself in and force them to play on the low ground and try and get lucky shotgun hits while blocking myself in after opening my wall to shoot. 

I'd like to hear your thoughts on the jetpack.

20,Brianiskey,1527917977,8nykmi,73,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8nykmi/i_feel_as_if_this_game_was_at_its_prime_during/,7,I feel as if this game was at it's prime during Season 3.,"I've played over 5,000 matches, with nearly 1,300 wins and the game just isn't the same any more. I feel like recent updates have been too gimmicky, have made looting too easy, and have just degraded the quality of the game in general. Some examples of bad updates \(in my opinion\) are as follows.

Season 4 map changes

* Dusty Divot \- Just another nuisance to cross just like Loot Lake where you're basically in a bowl that isn't particularly easy to get out of while being shot at.
* Hop Rocks \- A gimmicky consumable that lasts far too long \(Nearly 30 seconds\). I understand that they're going for a lore sort of thing, but Hop Rocks could've been avoided. When you're in a fight against someone who has them activated they can essentially build twice as fast and it's just not fun to fight against.
* It seems like the Crater is going to be around for a long while, which I am not a fan of. I don't see how it can be filled in any time soon and will be here until **at least** the end of Season 4.

Season 4 Updates

* Jet pack \- Why add an item that is a so\-called limited time item without giving us a time frame. Should I get used to people sky basing with them and avoiding fall damage when I shoot it out, or should I expect them to be removed at the end of the week? I Just don't care for the addition unless it's going to be permanent and balanced. Many problems with it that I could address.
* Shopping Cart  \- I know it's kinda fun to mess with, but isn't really practical in the long run. I would've done a limited time mode with them  rather than putting them in the base Battle Royale modes.
* Apples and Mushrooms \- Why? Is there not enough ways to get loot already? We have floor spawns, chests, supply drops, llamas, vending machines, you can kill people. Considering that this is a last person standing survival style game I don't really appreciate the ease of looting that has been introduced. Less thought is required and getting back to 200 is easier then ever. Which I find to be a bad thing, because it doesn't punish risky plays that aren't entirely successful.
* The changes to Shotguns and the animations of them. I can't figure out what EPIC has been trying to do with Shotguns, am I forced to carry 2 now because that's just the way the Meta is? Double Pump is back in the game, while not as deadly as before, still almost a necessity because of how effective it is to use them against anything else for extremely  high burst damage.
* More bugs and glitches with each update \- While they're busy fixing glitches that allow people to kill half the lobby instantly with the shopping cart, Xbox and Play Station still can't press the home button because it cancels matchmaking. I know it's on the Trello Board, but it's been there for nearly a month. If not more than a month. 

All in all I just felt like the game was better during Season 3, I still enjoy the game, but where I'd sit around and play Duos all day and have a good time, I now get bored and the excitement dies down after a few games. Especially when they start ending with someone jet packing around with an RPG, or people that are just driving a shopping cart around for fun. I miss the exciting build battles from the end of games, and just good fights all around. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy many of the changes that have been made. Builder Pro for console, and the fix for Turbo Building has been great, but again too many gimmicks, and as I'm sure you've seen the Directional Boosters are coming back, which no doubt will take away a week that we could've been given a new weapon \(P\-90, Tactical Assault Rifle, etc.\) and just so people can mess around with a shopping cart. Again, it's fun, but has no place in the base game in my opinion. Thanks for reading.

TL;DR : Quality of the game going down since the release of Season 4, too many gimmicks, not enough bug fixes and good gameplay changes. ",FortNiteBR

I do hope everyone is well,

Now then i have a few questions and i am so sorry in advance as these may be repetitive and for that I apologise;

Now then i ain’t very much of a fortnite fan (i know i know wtf am i in the fortnite subreddit then?) as such can i ask what all of you love about the game that i am missing? It does look like people are having a blast and i don’t see why personally.

Now then, in your opinion; is fortnite better with or without people? Is the community very nice to new players?

Personally i think the building part is gonna screw me over as i haven’t played anything to do with building since i was a laptop player (nearly 4 years ago now a diehard xbox player) now then can i ask this; can you still succeed without building?

My final question is this and it is a two parter;

Can i ask what recommendations people have for improvement of accuracy? I ain’t yhe best shot so i always ask for tips on it

In your own opinion what is the best gun (and for that matter gun technique) for a novice to learn that will help then to learn fast?

Honestly, I normally play COD; but it has been becoming a chore of sorts, and all my friends play fortnite so I really want to join them, all advice is appreciated and thank you for reading this,

With regards,

Tragical

Coming from PUBG, the communication with the community is outstanding and Epic should be proud of the phenomenon they created with Fortnight! 

However, considering that shotguns are the most used gun in the game (perhaps behind ARs), I can’t see why more has not been done to balance close combat. 95% of close combat is just shotguns. I think a few small tweaks would do worlds in balancing the overall game! 

1. That spread. It’s horrendously inconsistent, especially for pumps. I think the best solution would be to tighten the spread of the shotgun but lower the maximum damage. So shotguns would do the same amount of damage more consistently, even if it’s less. This way players aren’t left guessing when fighting if their shots will do 200 damage or 9. 

2. Fix the double shotgun meta. Being able to equip 2 shotguns and switch between them to increase the fire rate means shotguns are used more than they should be. With other close-range alternatives in the game like smgs and pistols being so lacklustre and underused people don’t need MORE reason to not use them. I think adding a delay between switching shotguns would make people only use one shotgun, and would make other close-range weapons more viable (although they need to be buffed still. Not the purple smg tho, that thing is a beast!). 

3. I think the gold and purple shotguns are great! However, with how shotguns currently are implemented (inconsistent and focused on the switch meta) most people don’t use them. Every single person I play with passes up these shotguns for blues, except for me because I really like how they handle. With the fixes above I think people would use these shotguns more as well!

That’s it. My two cents on the one issue I’ve noticed after playing for just over a month. Loving the game so far, but anything to increase the variability of each game (by increasing the viability of a broader range of guns) would imo, improve the overall experience! 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts on it!

You decided to put a limited time item into the full game just for a few weeks and then what? Just throw it away? Get a damn test server to test your stupid shit and get feedback from the community that way. Why put a completely ridiculous item in the actual game then just take it out? Whats the point? If Epic ever plans to make the game competitive, they need to stop adding these ridiculous items just to test them out. Epic is rolling in money. Why not make a test server?

It might not have been the majority that wanted this, but lots of people have told me in the past that they thought vehicles would be a great addition to the game. 

Epic Games, notorious for their generosity, answered the vehicles demand perfectly. Shopping carts are the least bit over-powered yet can be utilized in so many different ways to benefit both users. Just some ways I have seen the cart used thus far range from taking no fall damage (duh) to fighting the storm with a buddy while one heals the other pushes and vice versa. 

Don’t like the cart and wish they never added it to the game? Don’t use it... and... get this... it’s easier to kill people that are in carts. 

It’s only been a few days since they’ve been released so who knows what’s in stock for Fortnite’s vehicle future. ",FortNiteBR

I think EPIC should change it to ""Sniper Knockdowns"" and instead of it being 1 or 2 make it 4. So four Sniper ""Knockdowns"" basically. Eliminations with snipers on Solo should still count tho.
Yesterday I managed to knock down several people with a sniper in 20v20 but didn't eliminate them with it. If I had the sniper challenge yesterday I would've been livid.

I've been playing fortnite since December so for about 6 months now. The game used to be really fun for my friends and I as we could squad up and really enjoy ourselves and goof around. Other players also weren't as good at the game and a win would be really refreshing and fun, but losses were just normal and easy to accept

However, recently about a month back I began using trackers such as fortnitetracker.com to look at my stats and track improvement.
And while initially using them helped me to improve and get better statistics, once you start caring about your stats, you can never go back.

Games now are very unenjoyable, and if I get killed when I have no, or only 1 kill, I get very upset, not because I died but because it really messes up my stats.

So please, from personal experience to everyone: this is a great game, and its very enjoyable and fun, but please, PLEASE don't care about your stats or else the game will start feeling very competitive which takes all the enjoyment away.

I get if you're trying to improve then you should care about stats, but as a casual player, please stay away",FortNiteBR

For a game mode that requires teamwork, it's just bad for example, for one person to hog 50 rockets, meanwhile a bunch of their teammates will all have launchers but no rockets to use them with.  


There's been plenty of other times where I'll just get a bad initial loot, I run into the circle and pick up an AR, but there's barely any ammo, so I can't even really use it.  Meanwhile, there's other people on my team who will have over a thousand rounds that they can't possibly ever use.  The vice versa also happens where I'll end up accumulating more ammo than I will ever need in a single round, and I can only imagine that there are teammates out there in desperate need for some more ammo.  


Regardless of who makes the kill, it's just bad for the team effort for one or a few people to hog all the ammo past the point where they have more ammo than they will ever use.  


Putting caps on ammo would help fix this, so even if you run over some ammo on the ground, some of it would be left for other teammates to pick up.  


Another possible solution would be that when a person dies, and they have a lot of ammo, their ammo gets broken up into many more items, rather than being in just a single item.",FortNiteBR

I don’t know, makes you wonder if a lot of these people are just salty PUBG fans, angry that their game got dethroned. Then again, I see a lot of general hate for Battle Royale as a whole, simply because it’s a trending genre. In any case, Fortnite is undeserving of all this hatred... Not only do they consistently update the game every week and continue to improve the overall experience, but you gotta give props to Epic for sticking to a consumer friendly model. On the other hand, not only has PUBG barely fixed a damn thing for their game, but they’re scamming their player base for all they’re worth with scummy micro-transactions and loot boxes...

Nothing can get in, or get out of the bubble shield when it's up.

Inconsistent, Annoying, Overpowered, and too common.
If pumps are gonna be in the game they should be made more consistent when it comes to damage, I'll hit someone for 9 damage 3 times in a row or I'll hit a headshot for 37 damage and then have the dude I'm kill me with a 238 damage headshot. It sucks so much to have to not even be able to put up a fight and have someone one pump you right in the head. I mean 200 damage to the head, with how common they are? Come on. To make pumps better they need to nerf the pump down to like 60-70 damage a body shot and 100-110 damage a headshot. Then up its rarity, make it rare/epic or epic/legendary. Then I also suggest turning the heavy shotgun into a uncommon/rare or rare/epic weapon since it is slightly worse than a pump. I also think that shotguns should be more consistent. Shotguns currently can do from 9-70 per bodyshot and 9-250 a headshot. Those are some pretty big numbers. Maybe change that from lets say a 30-60 for bodyshots and a 80-110 a headshot. This would make shotguns more consistent. You would not believe me how many times I have died to a one pump because I hit a 9 damage shot when it should have been a 90 or a 200. Feel free to criticize me, I just think that shotguns deserve a massive overhaul.

Let me start off by saying that I agree that shotgun should have a consistent pattern instead of being random pellet spread within the perimeter. 

The reality that everyone needs to realize is that the alternative to the ""shotgun meta"" is everyone sitting in 1x1s all over the map hiding and playing the peeking game to shoot with ARs and snipers. This game would be incredibly boring if shotguns were nerfed. I can't imagine anyone except for 5 year olds wanting to play every match by shooting at walls and nobody shotgun rushing. It would increase match length tremendously, as well as decreasing the number of build battles (the most fun aspect of the game imo) and really punishes good players.

When I started playing I used to hate the jump around and shoot eachother game too but you get over it and learn to build. I feel like the majority of people that are pro shotgun-nerf are newer players that haven't figured out the game as much in an environment where the skill level of average players is at a sky high milestone compared to what it used to be. It's tough to learn but shotgun meta will always be a thing as long as building is in the game, and the only reason the game is fun is because of that ""meta"".",FortNiteBR

We’re sick of there not being an app good enough or with the features we need to use while playing Fortnite so we’re building something better. In order for it to be as great as possible, we would really, really appreciate knowing what you personally would look for in a Fortnite companion app.

We’ve put together a brief (no more than X minutes) survey, and it would be really helpful if you could fill it in with what you’re looking for, what you currently use, and any other comments you’d have. At the end, there’s also a place to enter your email if you’d be interested in testing prototypes or getting access when we launch a beta.

Appreciate anyone reading this far, GG. Also we’ll be reading (and responding) to any comments in here too, but if you could keep most stuff to the survey that would be amazing and easier for us to collect.

(Just as a heads up, we’re not affiliated or working for any company (including Epic) on this, it’s purely that we enjoy doing this thing and we both play Fortnite to death so it’d be a nice mix of work and pleasure. We also both post regularly on Reddit but this is a fresh clean account just for the surveys).

the shotgun is a pain to even get close because you wish its not a console player with AUTO AIM,

I think would be nice to have an option   to choose the platform u play against,

 No building.

 No portaforts

 Structures don't break.

 No RPG'S.

 No Grenade launchers. 

 More grenades.

 Less Potions.

 Less shotguns.

 All common weapons so everyone is balanced.

I think this would be fun? I played Fortnite a lot before it became mainstream. I have seen it evolve. There has been head spinning amount of content that has changed the game. I understand the game is called FORTnite. Taking away the building aspect would piss off some players but that's why it could be an option like 50v50. 

I am not the worlds greatest builder. I know how to build under pressure and block shot from all directions. I just feel like the building can be spammed and totally used in cheap ways to win. If you kill a few players and get maxed out on resources your a god. If you don't have a RPG or any resources in the final circles your 100&amp;#37; not going to win. 

What if they reduced the amount of materials? Let's pretend each resource would max out at 250.  Players wouldn't be spamming stairs rushing you with a shotgun as often anymore. Which is a common tactic that is used. I feel like the game is extremely unbalanced and favors people who are good with shotguns and building. Then there is the RPG. No matter what if you 1v1 someone with the RPG your chances are slim to none. I understand building is the counter to rockets. Most situations, you are dead before you can even build, Especially close range. That being said the RPG is REALLY OP.  The amount of rocket ammo littered around the map is unnecessarily excessive.

I know I added you on PSN and can say this there; but everyone on this sub deserves to hear of your kindness. We both dropped wailing with the intention of farming wood and getting our vending machine challenge done. We both had weapons, and I had the drop on you. I decided to gamble, and throw the respect gesture your way after legging it down to the maze to visit you. I wanted to let you know I was not hostile, and just wanted to finish my weekly challenges. You boogie bombed me, watched me dance, and then danced yourself. We then both partook in jolly cooperation by deforesting the North-Easern sector of the island. We each scored 3 purple Scars from the machine, and got caught in the storm. You offered me shields and health to make it through the storm and have a chance of winning despite me already finishing my challenge with you. As we came out of the storm, you diverted. You went and got a shopping cart and proceeded to wheel my helpless Snorkel Ops away from her impending doom. As we went through a building; I was spike trapped. You brought down your wrath on the spike trap and offered me cover while I trued to patch myself up. We got flanked on both sides while an air drop fell right on our location. With the hellfire of an LMG, Grenade Launcher, Assault Rifle and Sniper coming down on us, we held our ground. We took out the machine gunner who was now lobbing grenades at the person who parachuted in, and then you took care of them once I blasted the gunner in the face. But alas, I was sniped. You made it to the final 2, only to fall to the hands of a fully armored Omega who had his sights set on you from atop a base built on a mountain. I was going to let you take the victory once we were the last alive. I am sorry I could not give you that. Our cooperation was a forbidden one. But I will cherish it dearly. You are the reason I will continue to play this game, as you have shown me that there are truly, truly beautiful people who play this game.

This is probably in part due to there being more console players in general (although I'm not sure how to verify that), but it is actually the exact opposite of what I would have expected.

One would expect the skill gap in this game to be a lot larger on PC than it is on console. Watching top streamers on each platform makes it very clear that PC has a much higher skill ceiling (yes Nickmercs is a god I know, my point still stands).  Basically what I'm saying is that the gap between top players and average players should be significantly greater on PC than it is on console, and therefore one would expect the majority of solo showdown winners to be PC players. 

Yet the majority of winners were console players. I understand this is a controversial topic on this subreddit, but my 'hypothesis' is that this is the result of a separate tier of console players that extend the skill gap beyond what it is on PC. Keyboard and mouse users on console essentially gain the advantage of PC playstyles while maintaining the opponents of console. Even top PC players cannot keep up with the winrates of KBM console users. 

Now normally these elite KBM users aren't that big of a deal because there aren't that many of them among the millions of console fortnite players, but in a competitive scene like solo showdown where only the top 100 players in the world on any platform are recognized, the effects are a lot more obvious. 

I'm not saying KBM support should be removed since I know that's controversial here (and also xims exist), but maybe Epic should consider separating PC and console rankings in solo showdown and other competitions 

Tldr: KBM use creates a massive console skill gap, results in console players dominating solo showndown. Separate rankings pls",FortNiteBR

SMGs are not weaker than shotguns because of any problem with shotguns or SMGs (the purple SMG already does crazy DPS and is fairly accurate). They are weaker because they force you to be exposed for an extended period of time to deal significant damage, whereas shotguns allow you to instantly burst your opponent and then build cover. Also, the time you have to damage a decent player is usually quite small in close quarters because as soon as you damage them, they're going to build. Shotguns can take advantage of this time more effectively by dealing as much damage as possible before your opponent reacts with building. Good players use shotguns to withstand multiple build battles without taking any damage by using their burst damage to quickly deal damage while limiting their opponents chances to damage them. The building system ensures that many mid-long range engagements will also turn into close range build battles, meaning close range combat is almost always inevitable. Therefore, shotguns remain the most important weapon even if two players aren't close when they spot each other. 

Nerfing shotguns would not cause the shotgun meta to disappear unless they are nerfed a staggering amount, which would probably displease most of the community. The building system is responsible for the prevalence of shotguns in this game, and obviously nobody wants building changed.  

In response to the arguments made in the OP and comment section of the [""shotgun meta is getting kinda boring"" front page thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8nlzi6/the_shotgun_meta_is_getting_kind_of_boring/):

&gt; If I don’t run double pump or pump and a tac, I know I’m put at an insane disadvantage in any scenario, and it’s getting a bit boring at this point...It’s not balanced in any sense that shotguns are the #1 weapon used by the entire player-base.

While I do agree that maybe double shotgun needs to be dealt with balance wise, there's no way you're ever *not* going to be at a disadvantage without at least one shotgun. The building mechanics make sure of that for the reasons I gave. 

&gt; It's not balanced that I can get one pumped even with 100/100 on shields and health.

The strength of the pump is another fair discussion to have, but even if we nerf the pump significantly, we're still going to have a shotgun meta. The only difference is that most fights will be slower because everyone is still going to carry a shotgun, they will just do less damage.

&gt; Please just look at your games, look at the first weapons you pick up, look at the weapons 99% of players use when you spectate them.. it’s all shotguns, every single time.

There are several reasons this is the case, none of which can really be helped. First, most people land close to each other and try to get loot out of small, contained areas (usually some kind of building). In close quarters like this, of course shotguns are going to be the most effective weapon. Afterwards, when the early game ends, people rotate outside of these small areas and fights start beginning at longer ranges. However, now, players have materials, which leads to shotguns remaining prevalent for the reasons I listed previously. 

&gt; Solid Gold v2 showed just how fun the game can be without a shotgun meta as the heavy shotgun was so rare. Games were won by good positioning, teamwork and aim rather than rushing each other with double pump

Solid Gold only reinforced my opinion on this matter by showing me how completely disjointed build battles become without shotguns. In a normal build battle, you have to make sure to constantly cover the angles your opponent could shoot you from while building up because failure to do so will result in heavy damage. Against a skilled player who knows how to do this, your windows to damage your opponent are very limited. The difficulty involved in taking advantage of these small windows while limiting the amount of time you are exposed yourself is a core reason why build battles require so much skill. Without shotguns present, this is far less true because you can make several mistakes that would otherwise be grave without being seriously punished for it at all. The burst damage shotguns offer are integral to the skill required in build battles. 

**TL;DR:** Fortnite's building system guarantees that a shotgun meta will always be present because shotguns allow you to simultaneously maximize your damage output while limiting the damage you take by building after using a shotgun's burst damage. Since you can build immediately at any time, shooting a decent player guarantees that they'll build in your direction to prevent further damage, and a shotgun is by far the most effective at bursting people down before this building occurs. No other close range option can ever be effective as a shotgun unless building is not involved, and the building system causes even mid-long range engagements to turn into close range build battles. 

Sure, perhaps we do need to talk about nerfing double shotgun or one-pumps, but at the end of it, we're certainly still going to have a shotgun meta. Everybody is still going to use a shotgun all game and a shotgun will still be the most important weapon even if they are nerfed.

2. Jetpacks should not count as the weapon that gets released from a chest. I.E. if I open a chest, I should get a gun and a Jetpack, not just the jetpack.

3. Shield item with similar properties to campfire (potentially a mushroom stew or something)

4. Visible outlines of teammates through structures and buildings or some type of marker (toggle on/off) (only appears when they are within a certain distance (potentially chosen by player in settings))

5. Audible sound effect (or more audible) when you indicate for things (enemies/need meds/ etc)

6. Some type of penalty from dropping away from squad based on how close you are to the closest person in your squad. I.E. if I'm over 700m away from my squad when I drop (or some distance that is reasonable), I get removed from the game.

Further Explanation of this ^: It never makes sense to play squads and drop away from your team. This would work because even if two people drop away from the squad, the penalty would only kick in relation to how far you drop away from the closest member to you. This would only be in effect or the first 30-50 seconds of the game.

I understand this is controversial, but I think it's worth the thought

7. Anti-Build Grenade. I understand building is the main part of this game but I think that needs to become offset by something other than just - ""build better"". I think this is a step towards solving peoples annoyance about the current shotgun/building meta, because there's not going to be any true way to balance shotguns. (besides reducing the damage of every gun in the game or increasing the rarity of finding them)

8. Ammo from Vending Machines. For half the cost of the item in the vending machine, let us purchase ammo for that gun.

I know some of these are bad, some are good, and some have potential, so I'd love some input and discussion to push these ideas to then next level rather than just a ""this wouldn't work"" ",FortNiteBR

Now, Fortnite has evolved incredibly fast in the past couple of months, almost as fast as the rate in which the game has grown. In paper, the game concept is pretty simple. Pick a landing spot, scavenge some loot and resources and do your best to be the last one standing.

What differentiates Fortnite from other Battle Royale alternatives is this new mechanic that was not seen until now, or at least, so well implemented in a game. This is mechanic is building and edit, and is without a doubt, what makes the game have infinite possibilities, as well as a very high skill ceiling.

Lately, a lot of posts have been complaining about how boring and dull the game has been turning because of shotguns, or that is what people believe because it is the apparent reason as of why they are the most effective weapons in the game, to the point that they are mandatory unless you can manage playing with a huge disadvantage. This is objectively true; there is no denial that most kills in the game are from shotguns, but what most people fail to understand is that this meta, and the ""problematic"" that shotguns cause are not because of the weapon itself.

But why? How is a weapon that can one shot me, that is the most common weapon, which **also** can be paired with other of the same, to essentially double it's fire rate, not the problem? You must be blind you say. Well, I assure you they are **NOT** the cause of the issue here.

So, if they are not the problem, and their stats, what is it then? No kidding I tell you, building is the ""problem"".

Let me explain: As I mentioned in the second and third paragraph, building and skill levels have evolved in a overwhelming rate. To the point that if you can't build, and even edit properly, you'll end up dying pretty quickly. I'd even dare to say that building is more important, than a refined aim.

Ever since build fights turned into something common, shotguns also increased their effectiveness, because since they are one of the few high burst weapons, and more specifically, the only high burst **option** in close quarters, their usage also is becoming more and more mandatory.

Without a shotgun, there is no way of taking advantage of a fraction of a second where you are able to see your opponent in the middle of a build galore. This is why SMGs and pistols, which are arguably the only other close combat alternatives, are so unreliable and ineffective in said scenarios. If you managed to hit a couple of SMG shots in the same frame that you were to be able to hit a shotgun shot, your opponent would simply take on distance and heal himself back again.

At this point, it is safe to say that without shotguns and their high 0-100 potential, build fights wouldn't even make sense to be a thing. Hypothetically, if shotguns were to be removed, the skill it took hundreds of hours to master for some players would simply be ditched to the trashcan. Build fights altogether with shotguns are the exact reason why fort camping is not a successful strategy to win the game.

This leaves us in an awkward spot, because while I agree that the shotgun meta can be boring for some people, I also explained why you can't (or at least Epic shouldn't rush any extreme balance decisions if they want to prevent a community outrage) simply nerf shotguns in an attempt to widen up the meta.

But I still think that there is a way to both, reduce shotgun effectiveness and widen up the meta, without touching weapon stats at all [because in my opinion, every single weapon, except of the heavy shotgun, is perfectly balanced (yes, even the pump)].

**My proposal** is to rework **resources** stats instead of encouraging Epics original idea of making each resource different and situational. It's pretty clear that Epic tried or intended to make **FORTS** to be the way of playing **FORT**nite, but players didn't took long to realize that this was in fact, not all the potential building and editing would bring. Epic also made wood, brick and metal work differently in certain scenarios. Wood is the best resource in general because of it's versatility and availability, and metal is weak but with potential of making solid bases and brick is in a weird in between which I don't even know what specific use Epic intended it to be; it's not strong enough to handle a rocket explosion, but it's build rate is also low. Brick and metal as they are right now, are a replacement to wood once you run out of, when in reality it should be the contrary.

My suggestion is to make a lineal stat improvement and reacommodation for each resource, scaling with it's availability, so they all work the same and would make sense to farm them. Right now metal is so unreliable that no one bothers on farming it and the only way of reaching max amount of it, is if you kill many people or farm 24/7 in dusty divot or junk junction.

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7egog6/wood_vs_brick_vs_steel_fight/

Her's a really good post about resource effectiveness.

Now these are, what I think, my suggestion's pros:

- Indirect nerf to shotguns, as wood structures would fall down easier so double ramp-wall rushes won't be as effective as they are, so super aggressive game styles won't be the way to succeed in the game. 

- Overbuilding. There's also a bad habit a lot of players have fallen into, and it's overbuilding. Sometimes people would literally spend all 3k materials without making full use of editing, repositioning or actually shooting, but it still is annoying because those who overbuild drag a fight for way too long without punishment. As wood would be weaker and other materials would be harder to get, those who overbuild will end up in a pretty bad spot if they build mindlessly.

- The widening of the meta. As I said above, pushing someone is super easy nowadays because it takes too long to destroy a double ramp, but if you make it so SMGs, LMGs and Miniguns better at destroying, they would be used way more as a counter to close combat, instead as a close combat alternative.

- More thoughtful gameplay and decision importance. 

- If you want to play around forts you still would be able to.

I would love to hear more civil discussion about this problematic instead of seeing the same ""shotguns are boring"" every single day without facts behind, because people are doing absolutely nothing to contribute to solve the issue, and I don't want Epic to fall thinking that what they see in the frontpage is popular opinion and they end up making poor choices.

Thank you if you read the whole way through.

TL;DR: Shotguns are not inherently the problem, building is what makes close quarter combat so successful as a meta, and thus, making shotguns nearly mandatory. My proposal is to change resources stats so they work differently as they do right now.

Great! A reward for those who push to level 80 that you can't buy with real money! 

But what happened in my case was that the relentless grind made the imbalances of this game even more obvious. It all started with the hop rocks. At first, they were just a fun addition. Now, you find an rpg and have hop rocks? You're basically a god. Same goes for the jetpack. Those on the receiving end of those attacks have little to no options of defense. ""Just build lol"" doesn't even work in this case when someone is bouncing/ jetpacking around you spamming explosives. It's not good gameplay and is not balanced in the slightest. 

The grind also easily demonstrates the shotgun meta issue. I can't even count on one hand how often I've been one pumped with 200 health after putting 4-5 AR rounds into a 200 health player. Again, it's just not fun gameplay. Getting a headshot point blank with a shotgun does not require as much skill as those in favor of the OHK suggest. 

So, until some changes are made in regards to these issues, I'm just burned out on this game. Which, is a huge shame, because I absolutely loved this game during season 2.

I’ve been playing since last October and it’s pretty obvious that players in general are getting better at the game. More and more people immediately begin to build when they get shot at. 

This means that the effectiveness of ARs significantly decrease, because people will just build a wall when they get shot at, and there is no way to damage this opponent through all of their walls.

This is leads to the majority of people pushing and using their shotguns at close range because it’s the only way they can effectively damage their opponent.

Think about it, when’s the last time you killed someone with an AR at long range after they built some walls? You probably just pushed with your shotgun, because there’s no point in continuously shooting at their walls that they can instantly rebuild.

Personally, I think that it is extremely difficult to come up with a solution, because the ability to build is such a fundamental part of the game. But if anyone can come up with a reasonable solution I would love to hear it.

TL:DR
the reason shotguns are so prevalent in fortnite right now is because people can build, and the easiest way to get kills is to use a shotgun.

Here are my complaints with the mode:

1. Less tactical than even 50 v 50. 
it is just a feeling but imo the teams of 20 are less coordinated than the teams of 50. there are all over the map, one lands in junk the other in dusty divot, 2 go to tilted, etc
In the first 20 v 20 mode it felt like a whole team went to retail, one went to pleasent. That lead to big teamfights what is still my favorite thing about this mode.

2. Storm does too much damage. 
I often had teamfights that were completely ruined by the storm. Your team is dominating the enemy and noone other than you notices the storm. And because it does 10 tick damage your team gets decimated. That also leads into the next point.

3. Too luck based. 
Basically the team that gets the first 2 early circles wins and better bus route wins. With your team getting decimated by the storm it often ends with 4 damaged players vs a team of 16 people. The bus routes are also unfair because the team that starts over risky reels gets way less loot than the team that starts over junk junction.

4. Basically a more random 50 v 50.
It really feels to me that this mode is just a more unpredictable and luck based version of 50 v 50. Teamfights that can occurr at any point in time are not a bad thing but the thing i liked about 50 v 50 was that it was a relaxing mode where you can do challenges and improve your building. But those relaxing things are gone and replaced with randomness.

Those are basically my complaints about the new mode. I hope epic manages to improve the mode because i really liked the first 20 v 20. not sure if it is nostalgia or real but it was the first ltm i really liked and played on a daily basis.

Let me know if and why you like/dislike this new mode.

2) Fortnite blew up due to the fast paced nature of the BR game mode compared to every other Br game making it insanely fun.

3) Besides the incosistancy in the shotgun damage which still has it's place allowing for better build fights/more accuracy.

without bloom building would not be as viable as you would get lasered from other guns.

I agreed with the post earlier today that expressed how the shotgun meta is currently stale and becoming more and more of an unfun environment compared to battling with all of the other weapons. I decided to make a little mockup of what a Shotgun Test LTM could look like to go for changes.

All Shotguns:

- Bullet spray changed to concise spray from random pellet spray
- Recoil increased by 50% for each shotgun to make them more difficult to shoot with shot after shot, as well as nerfing double pump due to requiring better aim control after each recoiled shot.

Tactical Shotgun:

- All fire rates reduced from 1.5 to 1.2
- Magazine size reduced from 8 to 5
- Recoil further increased by 20%
- Gray - Damage up from 67 to 70
- Green - Damage up from 70 to 73
- Blue - Damage up from 74 to 75

Pump Shotgun:

- All fire rates reduced from 0.7 to 0.5
- Magazine size reduced from 5 to 2
- Pellet spread increased by 25% (Larger radius of impact, harder to pump all hits into an enemy)
- Recoil further increased by 50%
- Up rarities to Blue and Purple (Still work comparatively to current colors)
- Blue is floor loot and chest loot, Purple is chest only loot
- Blue - Damage down from 90 to 85, reload reduced from 4.8 to 2
- Purple - Damage down from 95 to 90 reload reduced from 4.6 to 1.9

Heavy Shotgun:

- Fire rate remains 1.0
- Magazine reduced from 7 to 6
- Recoil further increased by 10%
- Purple - Damage up from 73.5 to 80, reload reduced from 5.9 to 4.5
- Gold - Damage up from 77 to 85, reload reduced from 5.6 to 4.2

Spawn rates:

- All shotgun spawn rates decreased by 33% for floor loot
- Heavy Shotgun spawn rate in chests increased by 15%
- Heavy Shotgun spawn rate in Supply Drops increased by 10%

I know some of these numbers are a little ""random"" and untested, and a few things in here could be disagreeable and flexible for change. However. I think this would be a healthy base to start from for a LTM like ""Shotgun Test LTM"" with testing that could continue onward to make shotguns feel better in this game. At the same time, Epic could make efforts to improve the hated bloom mechanic in this game for guns like AR's, Pistols, SMG's, and Revolvers to either be severely reduced or even removed. These changes would shake the meta and make the game much more interesting.",FortNiteBR

Does anyone know if it would be possible / easy to roll out server maintenance at different times across different regions? 

I am an Aussie (from down under!) and server maintenance / down time is always in the evening when (i assume) most people want to play. 

Tonight is Friday night and the servers are down, when I finished work last night the servers were down as well, and coincidentally (I know it won’t happen always) they delayed the start of the new challenges a few days this week. 

I don’t really mind but if there is a relatively simple QOL change that could be implemented so that our servers (and others across the world) receive the updates during off peak times as is done in the US it would make playing the game a lot easier! 

Let me know your thoughts! ",FortNiteBR

The daily shop has been around for a while now, it goes all the way back to \(if I'm not mistaken\) October when the Halloween skins were first dropped. Since then a lot of skins, gliders, pickaxes and emotes have been released. On top of that, Epic has adapted a pattern where they add 4 skins per patch, one usually being a legendary, 2 usually being rares, and 1 usually being an epic, with X number of gliders, emotes, pickaxes, etc.

With that being said, that makes it a lot harder for them to put in other skins that people might want. So should the Daily Shop expand a bit to keep up with all the new additions? Right now there are 2 featured items unless its a new release or pairs with a set \(Ie Raven with Glider, Wukong with glider and pickaxe, etc.\) and then 6 daily items, usually 2 skins, 2 pickaxes, and 2 emotes or a mix.

What I propose is that there be 3 featured squares and 8 daily squares on Monday \- Wednesday, and 4 featured squares and the usual 6 on Thursday \- Sunday. This would put emphasis on new featured items on the weekends, when most people are on, and give more room for older skins to rotate in during the week, so when people got home from work or school they could check and have a better chance of getting something they want, giving an incentive to play longer or buy something else.

Why on specific days? Well if you haven't noticed, Epic follows a certain pattern: 'leak' the skins \(AKA get the word and hype going so people know what to expect\) and then release these new cosmetics on Thursdays \- Sundays. So with my changes, the shop for today on featured could have been 2 tabs for the new basketball skins, gliders, and pickaxe like it is now, and then one for maybe something like the Raptor or Chomp Jr. And then the daily could have all the items it does now, and then maybe something like the Spectral Axe and Survival Specialist.

This could maximize profit for Epic, and higher chances for the players to get something they've been waiting for! The store needs to keep up with all the awesome skins Epic cranks out in my opinion.",FortNiteBR

But for those calling for nerfs, or calling it boring, unbalanced, and unfair or whatever it may be. Consider this. 

The reason the shotgun meta may seem redundant has nothing to do with how each shotgun operates on its own, but actually the fact that a player can hold more than one shotgun in their inventory. 

Stacking shotguns since pre-patch double pump has been around for awhile now, and epics so called “Nerf” to the double pump obviously hasn’t made much of an impact as we all can see now.

NOW HEAR ME OUT. 

Just think about this for a second.

A lot of players are very confident in their CQC Shotgun skills even they are average because they have not one, but two shotguns. They always have another one to save they’re ass if miss the first or just don’t one tap you.

Now there were times when people only carried one shotty, and during that phase players had to be more tactical and build after every shot, they still do to those who run one shotty. And as of right now, with more items, weapons, consumables, grenades etc being added in the game weekly, stacking shotguns is still very dominant. 

So my opinion on this shotgun meta crisis ISN’T to nerf shotguns, give them a rework, or buff other one. But to REMOVE the ability to stack shotguns period, causing players to make a decision on what they’re comfortable with; Tac,(Low risk low reward) Pump,(High risk, High reward) or the Heavy (middle ground, hybrid, range of pump, damage of Tac. Moderate risk, moderate reward.) 

Now for those of you who will say, “stacking is apart of the game, they have to sacrifice a slot for another gun.” Yes you are correct, but for this crisis to be resolved without killing the pace of the game this might be the best solution. If anyone remembers shooting test 1, shotguns were absolutely horrible and smgs were king. Which also made it harder to make plays like killing 1,2,3,4 people to save your teammates or clutch the match. 

Feel free to give me your opinion on this respectively. I’m up for discussion/ debate, not toxicity. 

TL;DR - Remove the ability to stack shotguns in inventory, and thus slow down the shotgun meta without nerfing it into the ground.

Both of those games have a lot of options at your disposal. After the Fortnite replay system released I was excited, but also a little bit discouraged at the same time.

**Suggestion time**

* **Reticles and Kill feed:**

I don't record my game live since I like playing at low settings and to get 144fps for the smoothest play. I usually use the replay feature to do the recording part. In replay mode there's no crosshair to see where I'm aiming exactly and no kill notification to show others what I even did. So post recording doesn't reflect the look of your ""gameplay"" when that's what setting I have the replay on. It will help immensely for creators to get better quality video of what their gameplay looked like if that was implemented.

* **Camera paths:**

In Quake and CS you were able to set a keyframe in your replay and set another in a different location in a separate place in time. When you play it back the camera will move based on the path of your selection in time. You had **line** option where it goes straight from point to point and **Spline** where it will smooth out those turns to make it look like it's on a curved track (usually the most popular) if you have more than just a start and end point in your keyframes. 
There are also tilt options where you hold right click and you can set a tilt to the camera between points. Gives a really cool cinematic effect so you don't need to crop and tilt in post. 

* **Effects and features**

* **HUD**

Being able to remove ANY single HUD option would be amazing. I see there's an option for that in the replay settings, but it doesn't seem to work properly.
Being able to only show killfeed, reticle, and killfeed is ideal for fragmovies. Or any other hud combination to suit the editor's needs. 

* **Effects**

Post processing effects would make a great addition to replays. Especially newer editors that don't know how to color grade, or color grade well. 

Black &amp; White

Sepia

Many different movie style color grading effects to make it look more cinematic.

Film Grain slider

* **Wishful thinking, but more advanced**

* **Frame recording**

In some PC games, you can record directly through the game engine itself instead of using a third party recorder.

What I mean by this for people that don't know is that you can set ANY framerate you want, whether it's 24 up to 5000 if you so desire. And it will process each frame and once you're done with your clip it will drop an AVI file with audio into your video folder and it will be at that framerate for editing. But with your graphics, resolution, and framerate you selected, the time of the render will go up. But if you have the patience, it's incredible and helps so much for slow motion and whatever effect you need with that. You have more flexibility with your editing. You'll come out with an incredibly smooth and high quality clip. 

* **In conclusion**

I love this feature a lot with what I have at the moment, but adding a few of these features will make moviemaking even easier and create even higher quality content. I hope you guys see this and would love to see what you think about it. I'm a big fan of this game and all the creative possibilities with this feature makes it even greater.

I started about 2 months ago.. and my roommate who's not really a gamer started at the same time,  has probably played twice as much as me,  and he can't build a wall.   4/5 matches he'll fall,  get knocked down by a teammate in like 50 or 20v, or die in the storm.   The rest he gets shot in an open field within like 5 minutes.   He gets so pissed and starts yelling every time.   For example,  last game he played landed on roof of flush,  I said don't bash thru,  he did and died.   Once revived,  I spotted about 6 chests and told him where each was,  but he either couldn't find it or somebody beats him there,  more yelling.   Then he was running into the circle, 30 health,  about 10 feet away, 45 seconds from storm, and I see bandages which all he had to do was build a ramp,  keep running straight,  pick up,  then use in safe zone.  He stopped at the bandages, turned around 3 or 4 times, built about 6 separate ramps,  none to the bandages, dies in storm then calls me a fucking idiot for telling him to stop.   I explained he didn't even have to slow down,  he starts 'well sorry I'm not good enough' in tears.  The game before he's running alone on the side of a mountain,  hitting trees with bullets flying all around.   I tell him to stop and build a wall,  he dies, gets mad for not warning him soon enough.   Keep in mind every time he plays he asks me for tips &amp; he's 35.

+Make shotguns have one spread pattern instead of having spread be RNG based

+change the Tac and Pump headshot damage to max out at 125, and the heavy shotgun at 150

+add a switch delay when switching between 2 shotguns to eliminate double pump

+bring back the common pump, then lower the blue pump floor spawn rate and increase the blue pump chest spawn rate.

+lower the shotgun range

That's like finding the Master Sword at the Great Plateau. My proposed fix for this is to remove the green pump and move the blue pumps rarity to purple or gold. I also feel like something should be done about the Heavies as well. The tac is balanced in my eyes.

At the moment it's very hard for a Bad \- Average player to improve at the game, and I personally feel like I'm stuck in a rut, even after countless tutorials and trying to learn how to build to no avail. The pumps in general really make me bored of the game as well. It just feels like the same shotgun fight every time. ""just building lol"" just forces a boring build battle unless you're playing against a potato. This ain't good m8. 

I wouldn't have much of a problem with close quarter fights if the other close quarter options \(including the: Pistols, SMG's, and LMG's\) weren't useless. There is almost no use for AR's \(turtle up, or just straight up rush\), SMGs, LMGs, Pistols, Grenades, or snipers \(kinda\). 

I honestly think the updates with the pump delay, and the update where the Tac SMGs were first buffed were peak Fortnite. I actually felt like I had multiple options in close combat during those time periods. But now, it just feels like I join a game, get mats and the same weapons, see someone, build, get rushed, build more, get at most 2 shots in then die. Top 10s are the same thing too. You just camp until you get rushed or decide to rush someone \(or get explosive spammed\), and that forces, once again, a shotgun battle, or build fight.  If you do end up winning, it doesn't feel like much. 

\(This post is inevitable for downvotes, but whatever. No, this is not crying, no this is not rage. I just want this game to actually be enjoyable again like it once was. Inb4, "" play a different game. "", It's hard to leave something you've become attached to as this game rekindled my joy in playing video games, which had been gone since The Fall of Overwatch.

Adding a delay when switching to a weapon is **intrusive** that is also a bad solution.

What is non-intrusive and fixes this whole bullshit? Shooting with a weapon will set the same delay-before-next-shot time to any other weapon of the same type in your inventory. Shoot with a shotgun? Any other shotgun in your inventory has to wait the exact same time before being able to shoot again if its current time would be lower.

Now theres the controversial part: Shot with a pump and switch to your tac? You gotta wait for the the same delay as if you were trying to shoot your pump again. I am unsure wether or not this would be good, but IMO it is something to consider.

Ofc, the day would only get applied to weapons who currently have a *lower* delay-before-next-shot time.

Dont get me wrong. I do double pump, and I'd rather not, but as long as this bs is in the game I pretty much gotta to not put me at a disadvantage.

**TL;DR** No general delay when switching to weapon, shooting with one shotgun will set the same delay before being able to bet shot again to any other weapon of the same type in your inventory, so you cannot bypass the delay of shotgun1 by switching to shotgun2.",FortNiteBR

I realize that I shouldn't complain about this since it is part of the game but seriously jetpacks are literally taking the skill out of this building game. When a jetpacker can keep the high ground with a rocket launcher and win only because they have the jetpack (and not because they have skill in the game) there is an issue.

Unless you're lucky enough to get a GeForce Now Beta code, own one of the few top-of-the-line models from 2017/2018, or have the expertise to set up your own eGPU, the game is literally unplayable on Macs, even with Bootcamp. Mac users should not have to shell out hundreds of dollars, add customized hardware, and then install a separate operating system on their computers to run a game that they already have more than enough computing power for.

A proper port of the game to OSX, with accommodations for integrated graphics cards and optimized graphics, would make the game available to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Mac users otherwise unable to play the game.",FortNiteBR

Love your game, I play it almost everyday with my brother and some friends. I recently purchased the battle pass too. I want to go continue playing but it’s frustrating when your opponents always have the upper hand with regards to ‘Ping’.

I’m from India and I’m sure most Indian/Asian players can relate to what I’m saying. 150-200 Ping is unplayable. There’s a huge community of Asian players like me who are probably going through the same problem and we want to play, but nobody likes playing with high ping, leading them to eventually give up on it. We hope you fix the servers and we could also enjoy the freedom of playing on low pings the way they have it in the EU/NA region. 

Thank you. ",FortNiteBR

Bugged: the tipping point for me writing a post like this was me getting one shot killed with a green auto shotgun. No big deal, I'm almost used to it by now. I looked at the match stats and it told me that the damage taken was 96. I'm not going to go into the myriad of other bugs that we see on here daily.

Overpowered: getting one pumped from mid range is ridiculous. Especially at full health and shield. The fact that the shotguns are so OP also draws players away from the more fun to use guns because they NEED that pump to survive. Wouldn't it be nice to have a fair fight with a pump vs a Hand Cannon? Maybe just in my dreams.

Players are too good with it: this is not me crying about it. The ""git gud scrub"" argument has some validity to it. Problem is, everyone took that advice to heart, and now everyone is able to, upon reflex, one shot kill other players too quickly. I'll admit it does feel good when I one pump another player, but it's overshadowed by the lack of ability to *choose* if I want the shotgun in my incentory or not. I simply can't pass it up, it's suicide.

I wish I could use the minigun, hand cannon, pistols, and other weapons to have fun, but no matter what, you can guarantee that I will get 225 damage one pump from the other side of tomato town and controllers will be broken. ",FortNiteBR

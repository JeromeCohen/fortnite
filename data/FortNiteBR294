I've been busy working on a large bracket that will support 139 skins and the preliminary round is ready for your votes! This took  me a little longer than I expected so I won't be filling out the entire bracket unless the preliminary round gets a lot of traction/positive feedback! Who will be Reddit's top Fortnite skin?!?!

You decide who makes the final 128! Link to preliminary Round vote: [Preliminary Round](https://goo.gl/forms/ljs5eAgq8F3Hn6bL2)

The preliminary round consists of all 8 default skins, all uncommon skins, and rare skins were chose using a random number generator. I figured this was the most logical way to figure out which unlucky skins have to fight to get into the bracket!

If you want to view the bracket you can click the link below. Any feedback is appreciated. Like i said, if this takes off, I will fill out the entire bracket with the rest of the skins, create more polls, and let you guys vote it out!

Still some people are able to 1 shot me from 10+ meters away if I'm at 100+ health. 

I think they really need to raise the minimum damage dealt at close range and lower the maximum damage dealt from far ranges, as the current RNG had gotten me killed so many times where it feels unfair and just true luck. I understand this is more complicated than with other weapons as it's based on pellets and how the pellet pattern turns out, but other game developers have figured it out, which means it's possible, and it's not like they don't have the resources to do it..

It was ridiculously overpowered, doing 35 damage per hit for the rare version and 37 for the epic version. People demanded a huge nerf, and they got what they asked for. Unfortunately, because of this big of a nerf, the scoped ar became basically unusable.

Reduced to the same damage as a pistol and at a much lower fire rate, the Scoped AR has become useless.

Even the blue Silenced SMG does the same damage as a Scoped AR, but with a much faster fire rate. 

The purple Thermal Scoped AR, which should technically do less damage than the purple Scoped AR because of its additional thermal capability, does 12 more damage than it. 

The only reason why Scoped AR's are even picked up anymore are as placeholders until you can get a real sniper. They don't even much of a purpose in this game anymore, other than a place holder. All the mid range shots are taken care of with regular M16s, long range with Snipers, and Short range with shotguns.

At this point all I can say is that it needs to either be buffed slightly, like doing 29 damage per hit with the rare version and 31 damage per hit with the epic version, or removed from the game.

EDIT: Forgot to mention that the fire rate also needs to be slightly faster",FortNiteBR

Epic listens to the community, and watches us follow along.  We went through so many theories and they kept us interested.  Now that there’s a one time event (hopefully I don’t die as it happens) to get more players together.  Gg epic.

Usually, it takes a lot to piss me off, but I have been recently been playing Fortnite and I punch my chair everytime I die.

I would say I’m pretty good, but when I reach endgame i always try to fool around like trap people.

Other times, I always die at the start.

I play and play until I get a win, which doesn’t happen too often. If I quit Fortnite without at least one win, I become very frustrated and unfulfilled, which makes me think about it the whole day.

I’m pissed because I have the chance to win but don’t actually win, which prompts me to play several hours and if i quit Fortnite without a win that day, I am pissed and think about it the whole day.

How do I cope with my anger?

If we assume it’s not using it for fuel then the zero gravity mode could come as a result of this. Imagine the entire games supply of hop rocks shot into the air making the island consume it.

If we assume it’s for rocket fuel then it could be used to attack moisty mire or the hero’s base since it would provide enough energy? This theory might hold up since of these reasons.

+We have not seen any blue glow in this ‘battle simulator’ (blue glow is the main power source in StW and allows them to shoot rockets worldwide with enough of it).

+Hop rocks have a short duration and for just a single person so it stands to reason that a majority of the rocks must be used up for such a feat.

+They also weren’t going to keep hop rocks forever so they do need a way to get rid of them all.

That’s my guess about the launch. Let’s see if it holds up.",FortNiteBR

A couple of days ago I was a scrubby default skin. My KD was disgusting and I typically wouldn't get more than 2 kills. I was active on Reddit and watched YouTube videos on how to get better like Sypher PK.

I decided to just go for it one day, I landed in Tilted and was mentally prepared to be sweaty as fuck. I killed 10 people that game and won my first solo game.

I played a couple more solo games, and ended with a KD of 7, but didn't get anymore wins. Then I called it a day.

It sounds like really obvious and basic advice, but if you really want to get better at Fortnite, you HAVE to be aggressive and confident in your abilities. Never camp, and ALWAYS emote when you destroy someone.

**Season 2:**

&gt;No direct story line is in this season. It is possible that the Red knight and Black Knight comes into the picture later on, but to this date there is nothing in Season 2 that is connected to the story line.  
&gt;  
&gt;(This will be talked about further in the post!)

**Season 3:**

&gt;A meteor/comet is seen in the sky, growing over time.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end of Season 3, small meteors starts showering down on the map breaking buildings etc in their way.

**Season 4:**

&gt;A big meteor/comet hits just by Dusty Depot, breaking the warehouses and making a huge crater.  
&gt;  
&gt;The crater area is defended by Fortnite's ""military"", ongoing tests upon the meteor/comet.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;During the same time, a movie is being recorded including the bad and the good side (with Omega and Carbide etc)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A big footprint near Greasy Grove is found, that has stomped down an entire building, thought to be a dinosaur footprint.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In the end of Season 3, a post is uploaded on Reddit leaking Season 4 stuff:  
&gt;  
&gt;\* A 50v50 game-mode is told to be made, where 1 player on one of the sides becomes a big leviathan, where the rest 49 players on that team has to help transport the leviathan to a specific spot.  
&gt;  
&gt;\* Moisty Mire is told to not exist in the end of Season 4 (possibly the leviathan destroying it in the gamemode?)  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;The meteor/comet opens up, revealing a capsule with a new character: ""The Visitor"". The Visitor instantly moves to Omegas hideout near Snobby Shores, where he takes over the big space-rocket.   
&gt;  
&gt;Loud alarms can randomly be heard from the base across the map, hinting at the rocket taking off.  
&gt;  
&gt;A ""News"" message pops up in the main menu on Fortnite, saying to look up in the sky at a specific time today (June 30th), which is belived to have the rocket take off?  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A YouTuber finds in the replay mode, a crashed thruster in Anarchy Acres, hinting at the rocket takeoff fails.  
&gt;  
&gt;The same YouTuber also comes with a possible solution to the leviathan mystery, saying that the ""Dinosaur footprint"" is possibly the Moisty Merman: hinting at the gamemode having the leviathan on 1 side, and a big Merman on the other.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;A new Red Knight pickaxe is found in the gamefiles, hinting at the Red Knight returning to the Item Shop, possibly meaning the Season 2 knights may be integrated into the story?

Yesterday afternoon at around 3 pm EST on PS4, I was playing 50v50 with my friend. I landed at Tomato Town where I met an Omen with the Wings back bling. I was pretty much just running around doing the true love emote (I’ve had it since it was brand new so no I did not buy it yesterday) Mr. Omen was very nice to me. He started doing the Orange Justice and I returned the favor by doing the default dance. We kept dancing for about 3 minutes and occasionally throwing up the heart emoticon and spray. After a while I noticed we were losing 15 to 32 but you know what we did about it? Kept dancing. My friend eventually met up with us and started dancing too. We made a little triangle and started just doing all of the emotes we had. 

SPOILER ALERT: THIS STORY DOES NOT HAVE A HAPPY ENDING!!!

That’s when it happened.

A stray sniper shot hit Mr. Omen, knocking him instantly.

In a panic, me and my friend started panicking because we noticed there was about 10 enemies around us. We built a very sketchy looking 1x1 and tried our hardest to revive Mr. Omen. Meanwhile hundreds of default skins are rocketing and shooting at our flimsy little base. A grenade launcher shot landed right into our base. I turned around and ran for my dear life as my unfortunate friend, who was still reviving Mr. Omen, could not escape the blast.
Both my friend and Mr. Omen did not survive the explosion, leaving me alone to take on the rest of our attackers.

Right after, a clinger had stuck me right in the face. I knew it. I was a dead man. I made peace with my God and said a quick final prayer.

Then,

Everything went black.

Before I knew it,

I was back in the lobby...

the end.

Landed in the infamous Tilted Towers, got some good loot I think, then we started moving toward the zone. With us being in the zone, behind cover and whatnot, with minutes before the zone shrinks again, I get downed by a sniper. Sniper dies. Teammates proceed to ignore the fact that I'm downed, and just run away for what I can only assume was the greed for that snipers' loot. Now, I'm not saying that I would make much of a difference in the match, but I'd at least like to play a full one. Something similar to this happened for 4 matches in a row. I get downed, gunfire stops, we won that small battle, everyone runs for loot rather than reviving those who are downed.

If you're looking for a group to hunt players with during the launch today then please PM me.

We're up to 34 players now. We will divide into groups of 4 and queue into different lobbies to kill players trying to hide and watch the launch today from 12:27-12:29 cst. We are on ps4. Let's make this a battle royale!

If you just want some Tips, have fun with your friends and happy hunting! : 

1. Land at coastal locations and areas you think people would go to avoid players. The middle areas will already be dangerous enough and I'm sure there will be tons of others hunting there. Don't let the Hunter become the Hunted.

2. Keep aim assist on, and hover your reticle side to side over bushes. Lots of people will be trying to hide  in bushes. Don't let them get away! The aim assist will reveal if they're in there.

3. **Check the sky**. We're getting a lot of reports of people trying to hover as long as possible to avoid conflict. As soon as you get a long range weapon, check the skies for people still gliding.

4. Check tree tops. Many will try to hide there. 

5. Utilize explosive weapons. If you can find them they are the most effective for this task.

6. Queue around 10:27-10:28. This will be the most popular time for people trying to avoid others.

7. Check Reddit for posts telling people to land at certain spots with certain skins. Have your friends wear that skin and infiltrate them. 

8. Use silenced weapons. Don't blindly start firing at a crowd because you will get put down. It's going to be chaotic, and the more you can confuse them the better. **make them think that others are turning on them** if possible. Silenced pistols will be extremely effective for this. 

9. Stay cautious. Don't be a rush to kill them. Wait for the opportune moment when you can guarantee a couple kills from behind.

10. If they spectate you afterwards, don't look at the launch. Turn away so they can't see it. The replay won't work eithr because it won't render in the replay.

Also it's already in save the world so just port that over, up the fov, and add arm animations and bam its perfect for br.

also for everyone who says it will ruin building, no it wont. I tried building in stw with it on and it was perfectly fine. editing was fast, i could double ramp with walls just fine even with the building delay of stw, 1x1's was the same thing as third person. its not disorientating because when you build a 1x1 you're just spinning its the same thing no matter where the camera is.

also this game's bullshit factor would go down so much. Ghost peaking wouldnt be so overpowered, people have to show themselves to look for people, your character doesnt get placed in the middle of your screen so you cant see where people are, ALSO not to mention how easy this would patch the shit epics been working on. They make tiles solid so you cant edit peak, hours later people figure out a way to have your camera peak outside of a roof 1x1. You know what would instantly fix that? having a camera where it isnt possible to see outside of the box. Or how about hiding in a 1v1 with a floor at the top that you're clipping through, i know you guys know about that shit because i see it on the front page. Well heres an easy way to fix it. Force that exploiter's eyes inside of that brick floor. How the fuck he gon see you know my mans got rock in his eyes?

also you third person troglodytes also say that ""thats just the meta"" ""learn how to right shoulder peek its the meta"" ""edit peeking is meta"" well heres a news flash first person mode will get an entire new meta when people find out that shit in thirdperson doesnt work here. I think the new meta will be far better and faster paced. For example everyone says building is too disorientating. Well the best players will build in new creative ways that dont disorientate and flows well, it probably wont involve too much spinning, but def a lot of running straight towards people. I think a new building meta, plus the skill gap created with first person, it will cause the mode to be faster paced (especially during endgame) because the best players will be aggressive and aim well. It truly is a test of Darwinism because it is literally evolution. Players who turtle are gonna have a bad time as it is not optimal for first person, but a first person eagle such as myself i will dive down on him and eat the turtle because this mode is better suited by agressive play. Being an aggressive player isnt enough to get by, however, as although i am a first person eagle, i do not have eagle eyes. My camera is at my head so i cant see over shit, so when i peek i have seconds to scan the area and react. if i kill the man after peeking it means my reflexes and aim is superior because he would of seen me at the same time i saw him, if he kills me vise versa, i know when i die in counter strike i had a chance to win the fight 98% of the time, i just died. In this game it severely limits what i can do as a player, as the peeker knows my every move when i cant tell what he is doing. I personally dont think that's fun to die to

ok in conclusion im just asking for an LTM come on epic please, i dont get why this suggestion is always downvoted because i dont understand why you guys can play what you want but i cant play my fav perspective. it's not like third person is going away you guys will still have your precious mode but you're just keeping it away from me

TL;DR please add a first person LTM - the perspective is already in STW you just need to up the arm animations and up the fov",FortNiteBR

You can now substitute other items in place of them, which makes for a more balanced and more overall enjoyable experience. SMGs are now viable at close and medium range, and silenced SMGs can hit at essentially every range. Dual pistols are another phenomenal addition to the game, and I am loving the game so much.

Before I talk about the current issue, I'll preface with some previous problems I'm aware of:


- Lesser regions waited an exceptionally long time to get Duos enabled, well after the population had risen significantly. 


- SEA has an ongoing battle with even getting a server established for them &amp; have had little communication on the issue, making the game frustrating to play. 


- There's no regional patch roll-outs so the Eastern time-zones often get patches during peak hours, which can be frustrating given how little time is given after the announcement &amp; the patch days switching. While this can be overlooked it can often be frustrating when coordinating with friends to squad up.


**The current issue** is that the rocket launch event takes place in the early hours of the morning, e.g. 3:30 AM in Sydney, Australia (A significant player-base). It's understandable that they want to make it a 'one off' event, however there are plenty of dedicated players from this side of the World that would like to participate in the event, not just watch it afterwards. Likewise I'm sure there are plenty of players from the intended time-zones that can't attend but would love to.


A **solution** would be to repeat the event a few times over the weekend so that everyone can have a look. Don't exclude the player-base, don't exclude whole regions. Of course this all depends on what's actually happening but the message is in the future to plan to make events everyone can enjoy first-hand.


*Additional rant about gaming in this region:*

While I can't vouch for Asia or SEA, in my experience Australia is constantly getting excluded in online gaming. Issues such as not having servers in the region or missing out on events due to time-zones is extremely common here, Epic *needs* to start developing their regional teams. If you find this hard to sympathise, imagine playing on a server that is dictated by Australian holidays &amp; time-zones, multiple specific Australian skins come out with nothing for your own country, events happen but you always miss them because it's in the early hours of the morning, when supporting the game by purchasing cosmetics you pay extra because of the exchange rate &amp; when you get on at night to play the server is down for maintenance.


**TL;DR** The upcoming 'one-off' event takes place in the early hours of the morning for the Eastern side of the world (Australia, Asia, SEA) and hence excludes a significant portion of the player-base for what sounds to be a pretty cool &amp; significant moment in Season 4. Yes it's just a game &amp; we can just rewatch it but it's more fun to participate, likewise some regions constantly miss out on events in online gaming because of time-zones. Epic shouldn't set a precedent of excluding other regions. Even if this doesn't affect you, please think of your fellow players who aren't as fortunate to live in such large gaming countries.",FortNiteBR

As a parameter, I have been playing since season 1,  I have 4400 games played and 950 wins, I have a 7.3 KD this season and a 36&amp;#37; seasonal win rate so nothing I am going to talk about is a game-breaking change HOWEVER I have never felt the need to post on reddit about the state of this game. I used to rave to everyone about how great it was and how much the Devs valued skill and how their patches were almost always in that perfect spot where they dont change too much but they make good solid changes and fix things that need to be fixed. 

Lately, my feelings are that Epic seems to no longer value the people who have grinded the game out from season 1 they seem to be rewarding mediocrity. The server state is seemingly getting worse, shotguns are MORE inconsistent than before the nerf, phasing in and out of walls and floors has  never been so bad, and on top of it they continue to nerf building/skill related portions of the game. between the edit-peak nerf and the fact that I have to farm for a minimum of 90-120 seconds to get enough materials to have a decent build battle (when u double ramp double wall push it gets pricy)

Maybe instead of making the game this regulated land of skill cap they allow the skill gap to show in a game where there is no ceiling and people can just continue to improve and innovate the way the game is played. The game got to the way it was because great players innovated these tactics and other people caught on. Now Epic seems to dislike the exact nature of the beast they have created with Fortnite, the world where you can create basically anything you want in the middle of a fire-fight, so they are trying to use cookie cutter to make me play exactly how they want me to.  Or at least muddy the water enough to where shotgun battles are almost pure rng , someone can hit you for 160, 170 one pump when you hit them for 4 times for 30, 40, 25 etc its just sad like one  of these things alone is not something to complain about but when they are compounded and you run into these problems daily (especially people phasing) it becomes discouraging because the game can no longer be played in the manner in which I fell in love with it.

I just saw a post where there were about *ten* epic comments and they were all apologizing for the playground delay- all while people were saying shit like “remindme 15 years”. Let’s please not forget that this company has some of the most committed and helpful workers spanning from community coordinators al the way to game designers and animators. As we’ve seen in the past with other games from other companies, updates may come *months* later and oftentimes they waste no time on updating and explaining stuff to the community. So even though the playground LTM got removed right as it got brought up, please try to be considerate of the fact that they are faced with a very, **very** irritating issue to fix with the LTM. The least we could do is thank them for all they’ve done and continue to do and reassure the EPIC community team that it’s not a big deal that they had a small bump in the road. ",FortNiteBR

It's damage is terrible and it uses far more ammo than the bolt and the marksman rifle. It is hardly ever picked up, since the bolt is more common and much better. 

To fix this, Epic could vault it, or they could give it a suppressor or maybe they could increase the damage. A lot of things could be done to fix the gun, but I think the best option is to give it a suppressor. The silencer would justify the decreased damage and it would add some more usefulness to the gun itself, since the silencer would make it harder to figure out where shots are coming from.

Grab your friends and have some fun. This is a battle royale, not some cuddle playground. If you'd like to join a team tomorrow for the hunting, send me a PM. We've got about 24 people on ps4 set to queue at slightly different times and land at different locations. We will travel in groups of 4 so right now we have 6 teams. 

1. Land at coastal locations and areas you think people would go to avoid players. The middle areas will already be dangerous enough and I'm sure there will be tons of others hunting there. Don't let the Hunter become the Hunted.

2. Keep aim assist on, and hover your reticle side to side over bushes. Lots of people will be trying to hide  in bushes. Don't let them get away! The aim assist will reveal if they're in there.

3. **Check the sky**. We're getting a lot of reports of people trying to hover as long as possible to avoid conflict. As soon as you get a long range weapon, check the skies for people still gliding.

4. Check tree tops. Many will try to hide there. 

5. Utilize explosive weapons. If you can find them they are the most effective for this task.

6. Queue around 10:27-10:28. This will be the most popular time for people trying to avoid others.

7. Check Reddit for posts telling people to land at certain spots with certain skins. Have your friends wear that skin and infiltrate them. 

8. Use silenced weapons. Don't blindly start firing at a crowd because you will get put down. It's going to be chaotic, and the more you can confuse them the better. **make them think that others are turning on them** if possible. Silenced pistols will be extremely effective for this. 

9. Stay cautious. Don't be a rush to kill them. Wait for the opportune moment when you can guarantee a couple kills from behind.

10. If they spectate you afterwards, don't look at the launch. Turn away so they can't see it. The replay won't work eithr because it won't render in the replay. 

Like I said, feel free to pm if you're looking to join a team. We have spots for you. ",FortNiteBR

We get *INFO* on Monday, and that's all we know so far. 

- Everyone in the game is essentially either a sweaty tryhard that wastes no time holding onto two shotguns and trying to be the next oversaturated twitch streamer that no one will watch because fortnite is the Minecraft of twitch at this point, it's so overused and not fun to watch anyone that isn't established. If they're not a tryhard, they're an annoying child that wastes no time begging for a skin in a virtual game to come back months after release, and overall ruin the game for everyone else, and give the image of fortnite as being ""childish.""

- Season 4 did not grab as many people and felt empty when compared to Season 2/3. It felt rushed, boring, and lacking with useful items that don't become irrelevant after you get the next skin (I barely use any S4 skins, Omega maybe)

- There is no incentive to win, it adds a number to a stat board, wow who cares. At least compensate, or ya know, add skill based rewards. Omega and carbide are *TIME* based rewards, someone could be absolute garbage and get to level 80 just by playing non stop. (However I do appreciate customizable styles, that was nice of epic.)

- There's too many cosmetics, how about instead of releasing 10,000 skins on the daily in a shop that can barely fit 8 things (majority being daily items.) We don't need all of these skins, axes, gliders, it's too many. I like variety and all, but some of the skins released in early June have already become irrelevant and rarely seen. They're getting more and more stale. While some of them, yes are getting more interesting, a lot of them just feel boring and unoriginal, or at least they lose the feeling they did when you bought it. If you're gonna put in a ton of skins epic, increase the shop capacity, for the love of God.

- Epic, please stop adding new things every update that end up breaking the game. If you're gonna add a million new items, at least add a 6th item slot to hold them.

- Why hasn't there been a solution to abusing shotguns? It's not fair that somebody can hold 2 pumps and have the same speed as a singular tactical shotgun, but with higher damage... How has no one at Epic been like ""oh this is abusing the games rules so let's use the fat stacks of cash we're ripping from children to do something about it and make the game more fair for everyone.""

- I know not a lot of you guys are going to agree with me and that's fine. I'm not trying to rally up and ""let's all uninstall because we want this!"" but these are the main reasons why I don't have any interest for this game at all anymore (excluding STW.)
Why don't I stop playing it? I would, but I've already sunk too much money into this game, much of it being from when I actually really enjoyed it. Probably sounds dumb, and it is, but I just can't set a game down if I've spent some money on it. 

- That's all for my rant, if you want to have a legitamate conversation about it instead of just cussing and downvoting that'd be nice. I know I'm not the only one who has lost *some* form of interest in the game because of some of the bad moves epic has made. I don't think Epic is a bad company in any way, I appreciate them trying to interact with us and update the game as quick as they can so it's relevant again, but this is my breaking point. If Season 5 is the same unoriginal and bland garbage, I'm probably just gonna stop playing BR. It's not fun anymore. I don't like playing, I'm just forcing myself to get level 80 then I won't play it until Playgrounds is out.",FortNiteBR

Words cannot do justice to how disgustingly childish and an entitled group of people you are. 

Instead of being appreciative of arguably one of the greatest multiplayer games ever created and appreciative of an incredibly mindful/interactive development team, you whine and complain incessantly.  Moreover, you cross the line from appropriately critical to inappropriately hateful and disrespectful. Grow up. 

The devs are more disappointed than you, I assure you. Additionally, if they release anything that doesn’t work, especially after already having a problem with the prior release, the infantile responses would be mind blowing. It’s a lose-lose for EPIC, but only because a vocal minority (or majority depending on how you look at it) are animals hiding behind the anonymity of the internet. 

I know I am not alone when I acknowledge the phenomenon job EPIC has done with this game. I’ve been playing since the end of season 1 and cannot thank EPIC’s entire team enough for the job they’ve done. Keep up the good work, don’t knowingly release broken content, continue to fix and tweak as you see fit, and continue to be interactive with the community.

Weve been addicted to the game from its start and have stuck with it through thick and thin but recently the devs have been trying to make the game more friendly to newcomers by overcorrecting everything that better players were using to gain an “overpowered” advantage over n00bs

Idea 1. 
Reduce the availability of shields and healings. 

This way people would be less tempted to rush all the time if they’re not sitting on 10 minis. 
Shotguns can now more often be one tap kills since 100+100 becomes more rare. 
Also there would be a great increase in the value of these consumables as right now they are usually left behind as they can be found everywhere. 

Idea 2. 
Cap the materials at 500 but increase the resources you get 200%

I spend most my time farming just to empty it all on one fight -_- and usually the other guy has nothing left either. 
This way you know you have less material so you are cheaper with it. But if you do need use it all in a fight, you know you can farm it up quickly. 

Idea 3. 
Bring back the guided missiles 2.0

Anyone who’s played Assassins creed origins knows the guided arrows. I like the way they handled it. The further the arrow the less control you have, they are have less maneuverability and the sight gets blurry. 
That could work great in Fortnite. 

Idea 4. 
Save the world Battle royale!

LTM mode where the “not-zombies” from save the world are also roaming the map. Like a zombies BR. 
Would also be a great initiation to their main game...

Idea 5.
Less peak. 

Don’t get me wrong. Vital part of my game. But I can see how they guy at the other end hates me.  Currently Fortnite has this thing that if you jump too much you end up making these small pathetic hops. A similar concept for the peaking could work. Maybe increase the time between crouch and stand. Or can’t press it too many times in a row. Or even a decrease in the first shot accuracy after the movement. Needs more thought 

Idea 6. 
Reward the grind. 

It’s great that they added different gear for different levels. But you can still buy off all the battlepass tiers and be rewarded by xp boosts or more xp per challenge. Reward us for being good purely on merit and not on spending. Anything really... 

Well this was a mini brainstorm while
I wait for playground mode. 

Let me know what you think.

Reason 1: The Battle Pass challenge for opening chest in Moisty can't be completed if Moisty is gone.

Reason 2: It would be too difficult to program the game to change the map mid playing.

Reason 3: The big Events/Changes always happen at the end of the Battle Pass Season. 

What I think will happen: The Rocket will Launch tomorrow but stay in the sky like the Meteor did in Season 3 till the end of the Season then hit Moisty. ",FortNiteBR

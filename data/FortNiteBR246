Both are a terrible meta for the game and for players. Being able to shoot 50 shots in a row that blow through walls isn’t fun. Being able to fire 10 shots in a row without reloading with each shot being capable of killing someone with 200 health isn’t fun. Epic, please hear me out on this. Community, you too. 

SMGs:
-Make clip size smaller on P90
-Lower damage to structures slightly
-Decrease damage on drum guns

SHOTGUNS:
-Increase pump max damage; make max damage 195–by making it 195, it makes it viable to carry instead of it being one of the worst weapons you can find
-Increase all shotgun base damage—when I hit all pellets to the body and get a whopping 54 damage, it really makes me wonder why I’m even carrying the shotgun
-Keep swap time between 2 shotguns
-Remove pull out time for 1 shotgun

MATS:
-Increase floor spawn stacks to 30
-Increase farming rates
-Increase base health so that wood can survive a couple shots again

There should be console ranked tournaments like summer skirmish so that skilled players can get the recognition they deserve and low viewer streamers can have some help growing. Yes, it wouldn’t be as clean looking as pc fights but I’d rather watch a realistic console tournament than watch top pros hit disgusting shots on people that I could never hope of hitting. It’ll bring more light to the console community as a whole and i feel would help with performance and bugs on console because they will be more widely known (or maybe epic will actually care if enough people complain).

However, there’s a big bump in the road with this. Currently epic supports KB&amp;M on console which is COMPLETELY unfair to other controller users. If console ever gets some attention in the competitive world of fortnite they would absolutely need to take action on this. If they don’t, every pc player who doesn’t make it into a tourney would just plug their kb&amp;m into their console (if they have one) and go to town on some lower tiered players. Oh, and they’ll have aim assist if they use a XIM so that just makes it even more fair.

TL;DR: Shed some fucking light on the competitiveness in the console community.",FortNiteBR

So I’m listing some possible solutions that might be able to fix everyone’s problem. 

Shotguns
- decreased pull out time
- increased damage to structures
Green tac - body shot 70-&gt;85 head 140-&gt;160
Green pump body shot 80-&gt;95 head 160-&gt;185

I don’t think that the heavy really needs any serious buff

The reason the shotgun damage is buffed so high is because the range would be slightly increased but drop off would increase a little more

2nd building 

The build nerf needs to be reverted and also the pickaxe damage needs to be reverted. In fact building health should be buffed by 20 after the original change. After this make it easier to be able to get materials, about +75% and chests when you open them give you 50 of that material

3rd storm
The storm should probably increase in speed, this way games are quicker and more fast pace.

The only way to have this game last for the next 10 years (the way they say they want) is to have people invest long-term. That simply will not happen if the meta is only suitable &amp; enjoyable for the new &amp; casual player.

In tandem, there is no real progression with the game right now - other than getting the battle pass skins (which you can get by just playing a lot of squads) there's really very little incentive for a good player to try to continue improving. There's nothing to grind for, no leaderboard, no rankings, no decals, nothing. At some point, getting another victory royale is losing its charm a little bit.

I would honestly prefer some sort of soft SBMM that keeps people in noob lobbies until you get 5 wins or something, to the situation I've seen in the last couple months where the game is being simplified and less skillful mechanics are being buffed (splodes, spray meta, etc).

Epic, I love this game. Don't ruin its long-term potential by simplifying and removing the games depth. Invest in the things that make it unique and find ways to continue to bring noobs along without sacrificing the gameplay itself.",FortNiteBR

So I think this goes without saying nowadays but the fortnite community is full of childish salty fans trying to either get the P90 out of the game because they can't learn that you need a gun to defend yourself. Well, my point that I am trying to make here is, many times I see online that children posting or tweeting to ""Bring back the old music"" or ""Bring back the skull trooper"" Now I want to address the obvious in a simple sentence. You only want the Skull trooper, ghoul trooper or whatever because it's rare.

In conclusion, Epic Games makes the game and wont add the rarest skins back because they wont be rare and I dont see them adding the new music any time soon.

-Bring back Double Pump and make single pellets hit for 200 dmg each in case we miss. I expect every shot I fire to instantly kill anyone.

-Remove the P90.  Seriously Epic? Anyone who picks this gun up literally automatically wins the game and that’s so not cool.

-In fact, remove every weapon except for shotguns. Shotguns take so much skill, that should be the only weapon people are using. 

-Make structures we build impenetrable, it’s quite annoying people can shoot down our structures. Epic has literally nerfed building into the ground and making structures unbreakable should fix it.

61,Darfoz11,1533514025,94whv3,35,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/94whv3/question/,0,Question,"I am a PS4 player who just baught a mouse and keyboard, the most confusing and annoying thing for me is having to select something using a bind then having to left click to confirm it, and this is confusing to me because with builder pro, you click L2, you get a ramp, you click R1, you get a floor. On the other hand, with keyboard to (for example) click Q for a wall and left click to place it. So to summarize this: with builder pro you open the building menu then select which piece you want, with PC you select which piece you want then you have to click.

My question is this: is there a way to make it that way on PC? Is there a way to make it so that instead of having binds and holding click, it can be like builder pro? This way, there would be a button to open the building menu and then instead of clicking to place each piece you click whatever it is bound to. This way you could theoretically make click wall and right click ramp for example.

If this doesn't exist, I think it should. I've had many friends who have bought keyboards and have had this same issue as me, and I feel like if a setting like this exists it would become much easier and more accessible for a console player to transfer to PC.",FortNiteBR

I ended up quitting for family reasons. My greatest achievement to me was going semi pro in only 1 year. I believe if I had more time, I would of made pro league.

This used to be the case with shotguns, as they could burst 200+ damage and did not have a set spread pattern. A noob could look at a player without aiming and deal a heavy blow. Now they do not burst 200 damage and have a set pattern, meaning you have to aim to make your shot count.

SMG's need to reward headshots more and deal less damage on body shots to reward good aim and punish bad aim.

2 changes need to be made:

1. DPS on body needs to be reduced significantly. Damage multiplier on head needs to increase.

2. SMG's should have no bloom when aiming and little bloom when strafing, but also have a lot more recoil so you cant laser without controlling the recoil.

These changes would make SMG's more skillfull to use than they are in their current state and reward players with good aim.",FortNiteBR

Okay so I was bored on a hot Sunday afternoon and I decided to do some maths. (Weird right!). I started off working out how big the fortnite island is. To do this I ran on flat ground across a square on the map and timed it. I then took an average of the three times I did this and converted it into minutes.

((45.07+45.05+45.03) ÷ 3 = 45.05 seconds,
45.05s ÷ 60 = 0.7508333333mins.)

I used this information with the speedometer by Paradise Palms saying that a character runs consistently at 12. It doesn't say what unit of speed but I used mph because it's the most common unit but I might be mistaken. In which case my whole theory is wrong but anyway, on with the discussion. I changed the 12 mph to go with the minutes I timed in earlier into 0.2mpm (miles per minute) and then multiplied them together. I also then squared it. This then told me how many miles is in a square on the map.

(12 ÷ 60 = 0.2,
0.2 × 0.7508333333 = 0.1501666666,
0.1501666666 squared = 0.0225500272.)

After that all I needed to do was × this by 100 because there are 100 squares and, Bingo! You have the area of the fortnite map.

(0.0225500272 × 100 = 2.25500272.)

2.25500272 miles. Hmmm... That's actually not that big. I then thought that the people must not be the right size so I investigated. I divided the size of one of the squares by how many building tiles are in it. This was to see how big one building tile actually was.

(0.0225500272mi ÷ 2401 = 0.0000093919mi,
0.0000093919mi = 1.51147979136cm.)

A fortnite character is just less than half the height of a building tile so if you half it you get around 0.75cm. The size of a fortnite character. 0.75cm. Wow. If anyone spots any errors please comment below. It might be wrong but I had fun doing it so idc. :)",FortNiteBR

Epic isn't going to add the ability to choose your noskin, and if they do, it will likely involve unlocking or purchasing of some sort. The reason they randomize it is because it encourages buying a skin that you want consistently. (Hence why all of the Uncommon skins exist)

2. Epic making nerfs to harvesting is not bad, the approach just is. They need to do some rebalancing on certain items and what they give (the windmill in Fatal gives 1 wood for multiple hits, for example, which is stupid; the piles of metal in Junk also give very little profit for how long they take to break).

3. Maybe instead of complaining about losing material because ""Epic nerfed it"", learn to manage your material efficiently. Stop burning through mats and think about what you build first.

4. Epic isn't obligated to give you certain accessories with skins. While I do believe all legendary skins should at least include a back bling (considering their price), they don't need to include customizable colors, loading screens, or any of that extra stuff.

5. V-Bucks are not a good idea for a winning reward, as it'll encourage toxicity and camping for wins. A progressive reward system (back bling at 100 wins, glider at 250 wins, skins at 500 wins, etc.) would be much better.",FortNiteBR

I've messed around with a bunch of different sensitivities and keybinds, practiced my building in playgrounds for about 30 minutes a day, and made myself drop tilted repeatedly in order to get used to shooting feel. I was complete garbage for a long time. However, I feel as if I have finally gotten used to it for the most part. I still have much room to improve, but I am definitely on my way.

After saying all this, I was much better with a controller. I have about 60 solo wins between xbox and ps4 with a standard controller and not 1 solo win with a keyboard and mouse. My kd has not improved (if anything, it is still lower since I switched). Maybe it is the fact that I have 6 months of practice with controller compared to 1 month kb+m, but I was also learning how the game worked in that 6 month's time. From everything that I have seen and experienced, there are controller players that are much better than me. The only game mode where I have had a clear advantage is fly explosives and thats just for the lolz.

Input lag and mouse acceleration at least put controller and m+kb on even turf in my experienced opinion. Can we just let off the hate train on ps4 kb+m already?",FortNiteBR

The point I'm trying to make is cosmetic prices make no sense, they are absurd. Some Epic outfits have no backbling, whereas others do. Some Legendary outfits have no backbling, whereas others do.

Fireworks Team Leader is a re-skin of Cuddle Team Leader and has a backbling. However, it is 500 v-bucks cheaper.

Some Epic pickaxes cost 1500 v-bucks, whereas other Epic pickaxes are 1200 v-bucks.

Royale Dragon is a legendary glider costing 2000 v-bucks. Laser Chomp is also a legendary glider, however it costs 1500 v-bucks...

Epic needs to justify their prices, or lower them. Sorry if the formatting is bad - I'm on mobile.

This is the WORST state Fortnite has been in since SEASON 1 and our standards are decreasing.","Seriously guys. Stop ignoring these type of posts. Are we really still having a blast playing this game? Are you playing this game like you were in Season 3-4? I know I’m not. I know my friends aren’t. This games peak was towards the end of Season 3. Since then, each update has made this game gradually worse and I’m sick of scrolling this sub and reading stuff like “LTM idea!” when the game in general is struggling. Enough with the new skin ideas, enough with the new game mode idea, enough with the new trap idea. **JUST ENOUGH**

We’re all gonna sit here and pretend this game is super fun huh? Until what, Call of Duty and Battlefield steals half the player base? All because we let the bottom half of the skill gap make this game a circus act, rather than what it was suppose to become? The funnest, and highest skill gap BR of them all? With an emphasis on building? 

What had made this game gradually worse? 

1.) **Spray and Pray:**

This game has gotten so much worse trying to address turtling. NO, Epic. Making SMGs as strong as they are was not the solution, it was more poison. The Drum gun has way too much utility for a single weapon. The Meta is seriously using a Drum gun as an AR, a Sub, and a MiniGun (as far as effectiveness at destroying builds). I’m tired of seeing this gun be an absolute unit, with literally no skill to use it other than holding down the R-trigger. 

2.) **War on building:**

“Beginning players aren’t good at building”. WHO CARES. When I first started this game, I couldn’t build a wall, ramp. But.. I got BETTER. I didn’t ask for Devs to change the whole FREAKIN game so that I could get a couple of cheeky kills at the expense of more experienced players. This is seriously such a dumb route to take. To destroy what made you successful and different; building! 

Whether it’s lowering materials, Buffing explosives to the sky, or decreasing the starting hit points of builds while making guns like the Drum gun the best gun in the game. The war on building has got to STOP and we need to strike the balance we had in Season 3-4. Where the game was at its funnest. 

3.) **War on Shotguns**

Shotguns aren’t really under powered per say. But there was a clear path Epic took when removing double shotgun, and promoting/making SMGs a lot more viable utility wise and damage wise. The goal was to limit shotguns influence on the game. This was a terrible decision considering shotguns have a MUCH bigger skill gap to using then the spray and pray non-existent skill gap SMGs promote. 

4.) **The actual quality of the game:** 

Seriously, what happened? Maps don’t render. Huge lag spikes in the middle of the game. Huge frame rate drops out of the blue. Guns not switching. SMG not firing sometimes after switching from shotgun, the game crashing mid game and having to restart.. 

There are so many bugs and glitches in the game, it almost feels like you guys are devoting a little too much time into creating new skins, and not enough time actually up-keeping the game itself. I can’t hop into a game without some weird bug showing up sometime through. 

(At least on console) 

This downgrade of quality of the game is directly comparable to when HiRez studios released Realm Royale. They spend a huge amount of time trying to work on that game, their other game SMITE got way more buggy, laggy, and just in general; worse. Are you guys spending your time in Season 6? More skins? Whatever it is, delay the season if you have too. The game itself needs some work. 

If we as players keep ignoring posts like these. Then we deserve this path we’re going down since the last 5-6 updates. Sit here and act like it’s all a coincidence, but there is a war on the skill gap in this game, and everyone ends up reaping what they sow.

I'm a decent player (9.85% WR and a 1.9 KD) and have been playing since season 2. I like to think that I'm an above average builder and that I'm decent at CQC. Shooting with AR's, etc.. isn't my talent. As most of you know, these last few updates have ""nerfed"" my strong points in particular. As Fortnite switches things up every week or so, I've seen the game in a lot of states, and I can say, this isn't the worst one but **certainly** not the best one.

***The problem:***

I think Fortnite has 2 main problems at the moment: Shotgun/SMG balance and building. Let's start with building

*Update v4.3 AKA* ***""My death""***

* Shotguns
   * Pump
      * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
      * Damage significantly reduced.
   * Tac shotgun
      * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
* Materials
   * Loot Llama material stacks reduced from 500 to 200 per resource
   * Floor loot (mats per hit) reduced by 33%

*Update v5.1 AKA* ***""Spam city""***

* SMG's
   * Added 2 new SMG's that are both quite OP
* Shotguns
   * Added a shotgun delay that made it impossible to wield 2 shotguns

***My opinion:***

* Building/Resources
   * I think Epic has (if they wanted to or not) made it so that  if you are brave enough to build battle someone, you have to make sure that you have harvested a lot of materials, which takes a lot of time, **then** you have to make sure that no one else comes and pushes you when you don't have any materials because of the last fight.  I don't think that this is a good thing because it makes the fast-paced game that Fortnite should be too slow. In addition to this, building is what makes Fortnite so unique!
* ""Other meta's""
   * Epic's goal was to ""have a number of ways to play the game and be successful"". I honestly don't think that they fixed the problem, what they **did** do was fix the old problem and create a new one: they removed the shotgun ""OP"" meta and created a ""run and gun""/""spam down your enemies"" meta. I don't think that this is any better.

***My solution (option 1):***

* Shotguns
   * Heavy shotgun:
      * Remove the delay when switching to a secondary heavy
   * Add back the 2.5 headshot multiplier for every shotgun
   * Revert the change made to damage to structures.

These changes will make it so that the heavy shotgun (a pretty rare gun to find) can be used as an alternative against shotgun &amp; SMG strats. The headshot multiplier will reward people with good aim and give them a bit more fighting chance against other CQC tactics.

* Building/Resources
   * Loot Llama
      * Solo's, duo's and squads should have different amounts of material stacks, respectively 125, 250 and 500 per resource.
   * Floor loot
      * Revert the nerf made to floor loot
   * LTM: Playground
      * Make more customization such as unlimited materials or instant 200HP when you drop, as a result, people can actually practice their building, not only when they are alone or with their friends in real build battles.

I think that the Loot Llamas were a bit too op in solo's and duo's, but in squads, they are almost useless to pick up now. The floor loot change and the playground change will make it so that more people engage enemies or know how to react when they are getting engaged, this will spark more action and make the game more fast paced.

* SMG's
   * Reduce the damage done to structures slightly.

This change will encourage people to try other strategies other than just spamming down players and getting them to fall to their death, despite this change, I think SMG's are a viable option to be successful in the game.

***My solution (option 2):***

I have a feeling that Epic want's to give starting players a push in the back, so I've thought of this!

Let's put all the ideas mentioned in solution 1 and put them in a separate mode, a competitive mode so to speak (maybe a showdown v2?)

This change wouldn't affect how the ""noobs"" have to experience the game and the ""more skilled"" players can enjoy a more fast-paced, more action-packed game.

Thank you for your time, I have put a lot of work into this post. Feel free to leave your ideas below!

This is because of 2 reasons: average player skill is higher than ever so it takes more mats to kill a player, and the spammy nature of the meta. A lot of players would like to have farming rates to be buffed. Here’s my solution: harvesting tool modifiers. 

Modifiers would be an item you pick up, that buffs one of the essential stats of farming mats. The difference between having and not having a modifier would be a massive advantage for a player, so it would be a priority to acquire one. It would be to a greater benefit of players to be aggressive and land in higher populated areas since it would be easier for them to get better modifiers. They would also offset the disadvantage of having less mats later in the game since your spending the majority of the early game fighting as opposed to farming mats. Furthermore, it will help competitive because players will be farming mats less, and be more confident in getting into large build battles midgame. Of course the competitive benefit is only true if there are incentives to get into fights.

Benefits:

\-Makes the farming phase faster and increases the amount of mats all players have, but does not make farming obsolete

\-Rewards players for being aggressive with more mats, and the ability to get more mats faster

\-Naturally(doesn’t have to be put into the tournament rules) spices up competitive play 

\-Allows players to get into those bigger build fights that were the hallmark of S3

\-Buffs materials, but makes it more interesting due to the looting factor

Disadvantages:

\-Players with better modifiers are at a definitive advantage to those who aren’t

\-The best modifiers combines could make it a little bit too easy to have max mats

\-Fundamental change to the game, all changes this big have risk involved

So by now you’re probably wondering what these modifiers specifically entail, I have some specific ideas, but of course the numbers aren’t set in stone. As I said earlier, it is a BIG advantage to have modifiers at all, along with having the best modifiers. Following this train of thought, modifiers have to be fairly common. Since they are unlike anything else, and we don’t want to nerf the drop rates of other items, I think they should drop in chests. This would be in an entirely new slot, so a chest would give you a gun, a heal/grenade, 20 mats, and a harvesting tool modifier. They would also have a chance of dropping as floor loot. 

There are 3 aspects that control your rate of farming: amount of mats gained from resources, swing speed, and hitting the crit spots. There would be modifiers that buffs each of these aspects. Keeping in mind the fact that modifiers in general would be very common, the buffs would be small for lower rarities and grow exponentially to higher rarities. Furthermore, with higher rarities being very powerful, each respective rarity would probably need to be less common than the regular rarity is for weapons/heals (not by much, though). Here’s what I propose this looking like:

Mat rate boost- Common:+12.5%    Uncommon:+25%    Rare:+40%    Epic:+65%   Legendary:+100% 

Swing speed boost- Rare:+33%   Epic:+66%   Legendary:+100%

Crit spot auto hit: (even on the first swing) Rare 

They would drop from chests/players looking like the default pickaxe, with the color representing rarity. One thing I can’t decide on is what the UI would look like. Epic could choose to limit it to 1 or 2 modifiers, but that would require them to create a new menu to mix/match modifiers, which requires a lot of work, and mobile/console don’t have a lot to spare in terms of button mapping for such a menu. What I would do, that saves time and is more realistic, is allow all three modifier types at once, and have them auto upgrade as you pick them up.

If you’ve gotten this far having read the entire post, I really appreciate your time, if you could leave your thoughts on this I would also love that. This took a lot of time to create and I would like a lot of people to see it. 

TLDR: Harvesting Tool Modifiers solve a lot of problems with the game regarding farming mats, while adding a fun, interesting way of doing so other than fine-tuning each individual resource type until it’s just right. They also offer benefits such as an increase to midgame build fights, making competitive a little bit more interesting, and making farming a little less boring. ",FortNiteBR

I’ve been playing since season 2 and I think the game is in is worst state currently. I’ve learned to adapt with metas as they came. Initially I didn’t like double pump, build fighting, crouch peeking, using right side advantage, pump tac switch, or any of the other tactics that became mainstream. I struggled early, but then learned how to use them or counter them. Bloom RNG has always been dumb for me, It makes me angrier than I’ve ever been playing a video game to watch my shots miss while my reticle is on the enemy. I was able to cope in part because other strategies allowed me to kill people with skill when my AR shots wouldn’t go, I nearly always outbuild people and reset fights when they start poorly. But with the building health nerfs, and the buff to explosives and smgs, this defense is almost pointless. To me I should be able to counter close up smg spray by staying at a distance, building up and hitting my AR shots, but now my buildings never stay up and bloom still refuses to reward my aim. I’ve tried my best to learn what is in front of me, but dying to anyone with a better smg, being one shot by revolvers and hand cannons mid air, going down to 3 AR shots at full health when my first 5 missed, all when I’ve out built people is getting old.

They won’t acknowledge anything buggy or wrong with the mobile port. They keep adding and adding features for new players and not fixing anything at all. If you other platform players (besides Mac) think your support is bad. You’re dead wrong. We have been having to play with bugs since Season 3 that restrain to even building properly or getting a gun. This interaction bug doesn’t let us edit, pick up/swap items, open chests/supply drops/doors. Auto run turns on randomly for no reason. Building is delayed when you quickly switch to it. If you play for more than 2 hours at a time, the performance just turns to absolute shit. And for you guys that complain about mobile gaming not being a thing. Do a little more research. And that has nothing to with an post that requests for things to fixed.

Now I’m worried with the Android port is that it’s going to be super hyped and everything, then after the first few weeks, they’re not even going to acknowledge. It hurts to see console players and pc players instantly complain about a problem and get hundreds of upvotes. When we complain about something, it ends up with a downvote and a comment ranging from one of the most incredible and supportive suggestions:

1) Buy a console
2) Buy a PC
3) You guys are inferior ( but we build faster than people with controllers lol)
4) Mobile gaming isn’t as popular as pc and console
5) Etc, more shit to talk about

Why would we ever want to support a game that the devs don’t really care about. The amount of features that aren’t there but should be there are just mind blowing. Elimination feed, spectator count, career, facial animations (even if they’re shit), etc. This port has been out since March. It still can’t keep up to par with a console in terms of features. I’m willing to bet that things like Stats won’t even be here even in September. If I doesn’t release with the Android port, I’ll be more than convinced that Epic just doesn’t care about us.",FortNiteBR

Holds 3 instead of 4.

Has more HP than the standard ATK.

Roof mounted LMG for one player in the back to use. Using his own Medium Ammo and needing cooldown every few seconds.

Extremely rare with only 3 or 4 in a game at once.

LMG can only shoot forwards and about 45 degrees left and right.
Notes

I’m unsure about LMG damage just because i don’t fully understand how much would be good. Same with the health of the vehicle.

I do understand it doesn’t very much fit with the fortnite style but i believe if the armor looked very makeshift, it would fit right in.

It would probably look like an ATK covered in the metal material looking very scrap metal like with a fairly large LMG on top.

So here I am just making a regular post with some mini games I've tried with my friends.

1 - Hide n' Seek, (2-4 Players)

There is one seeker and the rest are hiders you pick a town to hide in. (We chose titled towers) You have to stay in that place. The hiders have 1-5 minutes to hide (up to you) then the seeker is released trying to find the people hiding. Once a hider has been found you would be killed by the seeker and when you re spawn you would have to swap teams and join the seeker to find the other friends in the game. Once everyone gets caught the person who was found first becomes the seeker and so on.

2 - ATK's Collide (2-4 Players)

Everyone who is playing will need a ATK. You would build a platform fairly high up in the sky. The platform size is whatever you deem appropriate. You would all be in the corner and try hitting each other off. I would recommend making holes in the platform to create it more interesting as well as adding couple bouncers to make it more interesting. The last person standing is the winner. You can change it up and do duos or make the platform more interesting.

3 - Spike Hall (2 Players)

This is more of a fun option. You would build a 2x20 long hall with spike traps on top. You will need a rocket launchers to do this you would edit a wall so it is the lowest high possible at one end and you would get the second person to stand on top of that edited wall in the middle so that he can be rocket rided inside the hall. The spike traps will go off but will not kill the person and it just in general looks cool and awesome with two traps going off one after the other. If it is not down the middle it doesn't look as cool.

4 - One in the Chamber (2-4 Players)

Everyone needs to find a deagle but shoot all bullets except 1. So they only have 1 bullet left. They cannot build and are in a town like Retail Row or Tilted Towers once you kill someone with deagle you get a extra bullet. If you use up that one bullet you will have to try to pickaxe the person. You cannot build. As well as before starting the fight every players needs to be either 10HP or less. To guarantee a kill and make sure one pickaxe hit will kill the person. You keep going for a time person with most kills wins.

5 - Edit Wars (2-4 Players)

You would build a platform of your size and option. I would recommend a 10x10 platform with multiple layers down below. You start off in each corner and try to edit each other out so they fall down to the layer below and so on the person last alive and still on the structure wins. However, this can be a bit unfair if you are cross-platforming especially against mobile due to editing being very difficult aswell as xbox etc.

6 - Spleef (2-4 Players)

This is kind of like Edit wars but you would build a platform that is of multiple size. Like 12x12 maybe bigger and you would have guns of your choice. (You would be on the same team so you do not take damage) You should build it out of wood so it is easier to destroy. Once you start you use the weapons to try to shoot each other down to the bottom last person ontop wins.

7 - Deathrun (2-4 Players)

You would build a sniping tower that is overlooking a course. The course has multiple layers to it with some barricades to block shots with this can be a edited wall so there is not the sides or whatever you want. The can 2 snipers and 2 runners or 1 sniper and 3 runners whatever you like. The sniper needs to stop the runners from reaching the end but shooting the and killing them. If all the runners die you restart until someone makes it or they've given up cause your a pro. The first person to make it becomes the sniper.

8 - Maze Runner (2-4 Players)

You would build a platform in the middle with a gun in the middle. You would build mazes for each other. So if I was doing it with a mate me and my friend would swap sides and build each other a maze of hard difficulty. Once you have finished building the maze you would swap sides and on the ""GO"" mark try completing each others mazes and get to the weapon in the middle then track down the last person and kill him.

9 - Race Crouse (3 Players who play 1 to set it up)

One person sets it up and they all have to pick a side metal, brick or wood. One of them has a trap in them if they pick the wrong on the person dies and is out and you keep going until the last person is alive and you can swap it around.

10 - Rollercoster (1-4 Players

You would get a ATK or Shopping cart as well as multiple bouncers and or jumpads and you would build a rollercoster without loops and basically have awesome builds using bounce pads in order to reach a end.

11 - Capture the flag (2-4)

You would go do 1v1 or 2v2 depending on what you have. You would pick a flag like Port-a-ford and impluse on each sides you would have a certain limited amount of mats you can use. You have around the same weapons or as close to those weapons and you would try capturing and stealing the opponents flag and bringing it back to your base in order to score a point for your team.

12 - Trickshots (2 Players)

Have one person stand on the botton of the platform with bounce pads on ramps once person has a bolt or semi and they to try no scope and in general to trickshots with snipers and kill the oponant in a cool way.

13 - Dodge Kart (2-4 Players)

You would split up in duos and one duo would have ATK's with ramps going up. There would be a platform in the middle where the other duo would be standing that duo will have snipers or remote explosives whatever you want. The team with the ATK's would try to ram the people on the platform off that platform if they go off that platform they are declared dead and can't join in. Once they ran each other over you would swap sides and the other team would try to kill the drivers. You may require multiple ATK's to do this.

These are all the games that I've tried with my friends. I hope you all enjoy yourself in fortnite and thanks for reading my post. If you have any other ideas or games to play just put them in the comments. Thanks again ; ). Hope I helped out.",FortNiteBR

And pumps deal only 188 damage with the 2.5 second wait between shots. Most of the time pumps already deal only 7 damage. So why is 225 damage for the pump headshot op? I mean smgs dont need headshots to deal 200 DPS and you just need to hold left click. While with the pump you gotta aim. My solution is to remove the pump delay, increase damage of shotguns, and nerf smgs to the point where they dont do 200 DPS. The tactical smg was more skill based due to it being not that much of a spray weapon. But with the P90s and Tommy guns you just gotta hold left click and wait for the elimination. Never thought I'd be complaining but I'm running into too many sprayers. I really wish to go back to season 3 where smgs were not op and in their place. ",FortNiteBR

This game has become a total spray and pray, what I mean is you spray an smg at the enemy but because your character stands infront of your crosshair you cant see the enemy. Which then results in your enemy giving you a 45 headshot dmg with a pump before both of you die to a rocket.

I know epic are trying to make bad players with these changes happy, but the only thing you give good players is tournaments and Solo Showdown. Lets bring the smg to its old state and buff the pump and tac (not as much as it used to be). Make building useful again, buff materialdrops from farming and the floor. Remove the autopickup weapons function. Make fortnite fortnite again. It had so much potential but bad players made the game not enjoyable.

Lower FPS, higher ping, hitches, parts of the map not rendering, ghost footsteps after every kill, the yellow wall bug, and of course the builder pro/turbo building bugs, ect.

I used my detective skills to find out. In each instance they were using the Drift pink pickaxe with the default skin.

It was and still is the most fun game i've ever played. But nowadays IT IS NOT FUN. After the new SMG and Compact SMG have been added. The game is just terrible. I consider myself a pretty good player. I started pretty much since end of september. Now off to what i really don't like with Patch 5.0 and beyond.

First of all, since i started playing the game it was a known fact that who ever built was winning games, because they took their time to learn it and increase the skill gap. Now even newbies that don't even build atleast 2 stories high can spray or bombard you with splodes or any SMG/LMG/Minigun and kill you just because you can't get a shot off. MY point is. It feels like. Season 1 you're playing on Extra hard difficulty of learning and mastering. And Season 5 you're playing on Easy difficulty.( this is refered to newbs)
Now when it comes to double shotguns. I definently agree the Season 2 double pump was very powerful and effective and definently needed a change, but not neccesarily removed from the game. Everyone was forced to either start using Tac again or use the pump with a different weapon(preferably smgs) or shotgun. 
Now on this subreddit i see arguements against those that want double pump back. But how about we bring back the Pump+tac pump+heavy meta back? Imo it was the most balanced meta of which the community did not have any complaints on.
And people, please, Double pump in Season 4 was never over powered, it was just over used, if anyone really wanted to win and deal alot of damage and have an easy game they would use pump with the tac smg.)
Now when it comes to building and Pump shotgun nerfs. 
Why? Building doesn't not need any changes because it is what made the game. I understand the pump nerf when Double pump was removed. But now when it is single pump THERE IS NOTHING to justify the pump nerfs. 
Also EPIC is secretly nerfing resource gathering. In my opinion it's a really bad change and needs to be buffed.
I hate having no materials end or mid game. also hate having to gather resource early game for 5 minutes.

This meta is not liked by any pros and nor any competitive players at the moment. This meta makes the game not fun and really is pulling back to a game i used to play a year ago semi professionaly again. 

TLDR
If shotguns stay the same way. Revert pump nerfs. 
Revert all changes made to building materials.
Vault or seriously nerf /rework the recent SMGS.
If shotty switch delay is removed. Disable double pump, but allow Pump+ tac and pump + heavy for no complaints out of the community, since you will have more than one choice of shotgun so it's balanced.
Make the game easy to learn, but seriously hard to master for Newbs.
Buff resource gathering.

People miss Sky limit fights, but now its impossible to get to there without getting shot down or having your enemy bouncer off and shoot the bottom .

We only hope  that they will but some may never. And you may think they’re increasing hype, or it comes back next week but we’ve said this over and over and it never does happen. 

What if Epic made the shop bigger so we never have to go through this? Like not a 24/7 shop but just a bit bigger? idk just bring back Tomato head lol",FortNiteBR

They should either get rid of it on a trial bases or try something like the person shooting a downed player takes damage, and the only way to not take damage is by hitting them with a pick axe. This would promote more team fighting and less irritation of noobs just shooting your downed teammate while you are standing right there shooting at them. It would also make elimination challenges more difficult and fun instead of just using a pistol to elim someone. They should also try getting rid of shotguns entirely, maybe make a mode as a trial where they are not in it, promoting more distances fighting instead of the usual rush and build tactic. They should also nerf building because let’s face it, it’s overpowered and annoying. They should also buff pistols, because if you are able to consistently shoot someone with a pistol, you should do more damage, and maybe add in some sort of flinch, so if you are aiming and get shot your aim isn’t as accurate.

I personally have been playing Fortnite since the launch of the battle royale mode that I heard about when some of my favorite youtubers that where sponsored by epic announced it as well. So I'm a fortnite br ""veteran"" that has been playing since launch. You know, for almost a year it was fun and refreshing as there was constant almost weekly updates and bug fixes and not to mention the huge map update. But I felt like the updates were to constant to the point where everyone is just talking about a new update in fortnite about some stupid weapon I'll probably never ever utilize. Along with all of the youtube and twitch videos and streams about the new update or item that builds a little hype and then months later that weapon or item just loses its interest.
Then about 3 months or so I just got tired off hearing about those ""OMG GUYS NEW WEAPON THAT WILL BE IRRELEVANT OR GAME BREAKING FOR 2 WEEKS LOL UNTIL ITS NERFED AND THEN BECOMES OBSOLETE OR REMOVED"" *crossbow cough cough, *homing missile cough cough. And looking back to before where everyone wants the ""inside scoop"" on what's being added to fortnite and blah blah blah, it just has become so boring it may draw ties to pokemon go in which it was extremely popular for a while and then it dwindled into absurdity. I guess we just played it way too much and tired it out, that's all. And despite a small amount of people not playing it,  there will always be that majority of kids that play it, you know the ones that do fortnite dances at the airport and call any blue drink a shield potion. 

And that is my Love/Hate relationship with the game that is Fortnite Battle Royale. ",FortNiteBR

A sun strider snuck up on my box and stink bombed me out, obviously I was low just getting out of the storm, so low and now being damaged I broke out because it was in the ground so editing would be glitched, and upon doing so the guy pumped me in the face from my roof. In that situation I was helpless, and I don't feel that way in any other situation in fortnite, I'm a decent player that gets consistent kills and can build, there's no reason for a player such as myself to be put into a situation like that. Back to the main topic, stink bombs are rarely useful and normally just take away the chance to get a better item. They obviously don't play much of a role in this game besides placing yellow smoke everywhere and doing like 10 damage. I think they should be vaulted or at least can breach your builds, what do you think?

But I can't for the life of me figure out their thought process on the recent changes to the game. If you don't know, I'm referring to the new SMGs and overall building nerfs.

For the first time ever I'm actually getting kind of bored of Fortnite BR. Everything Epic is doing to the game right now is promoting some of the most anti-fun gameplay I've experienced since I've started playing. It's near impossible to ramp rush now because of how fast you can get shot out. The skill ceiling is getting lower and lower due to all of the spray weapons like the drum gun and P90 (even with the nerfs, it's still pretty good). The worst part is that there is no punishment for spamming these weapons, it doesn't take long at all to reload them when the magazine is depleted and people will even run multiple of the same weapon just so they can have consistent spraying. Not to mention the only counter to these weapons (shotguns) are in a terrible state. The pump still has the year-long delay when you pull it out, so there's no hope in trying to get a shot off on someone who is spraying your walls down with SMGs.

I don't mean for this to be another post just complaining, I love this game and I really do appreciate Epic for all the work they've put into this game. But please, please don't ruin what made you guys so popular. Nerfing building into the ground and adding endless spray weapons is not the answer.",FortNiteBR

My name is Nathan. (Allochtoon on Fortnite)  
I'm a student in software development in the Netherlands, and lately i've been experimenting with DLL injectors, wich resulted in me getting banned from Fortnite for cheating.

2 days ago i was experimenting with a classmate with an DDL injector he made himself. When we were done i wanted to play a few games of Fortnite before going to bed. I was playing in a normal Solo match, when suddenly my game froze for a few seconds, after wich i got kicked by BattleEye. BattleEye probably found the software in the background a little suspicious, wich is understandable. So i closed out of Fortnite, went to my task manager, killed the processes related to the injector that were running, and joined another game like nothing happened. At first it seemed fine, but after a minute i got kicked again. I was pretty confused at this point. So i restarted my pc to be sure there were no more processes running. And indeed, when i started the game again, i could just play like usual. I played a couple games and went to bed.

2 days later, i wanted to start my game, but i couldn't login. I got an error message wich i didn't read, i just assumed i had a typo in my password, so i tried again: Same result. I read the error message wich stated i had been banned for one of the following reason:  
\* The owner of the account (me) requested the account to be suspended  
\* Fraud  
\* Cheating

Obviously i have never requested to suspend my account, and i have never scammed anyone in STW (I suppose thats what they mean with fraud?) So i must have been banned for cheating, wich i have never done. I assume i got banned for having the DLL injector running in the background, wich i think is a little aggressive behavior from BattleEye. I understand cheating isn't accepted. But is it worth banning innocents in the process? I feel like Epic Games is just walking away with over 50$ of skins.

To everyone who read my story: Please be careful with whatever you have running in the background.  
If anyone knows a way to get this reversed, please let me know how. I don't wanna quit this game.

Now imo i think removing Turbo building could be positive and negative, i would at least want Epic to try this because there are so many building strats and metas that are only achievable with turbo building.

It would be interesting to see how players who hold down their mouse perform without it, if epic were to nerf materials to 700 each max and increase farming rates, i think this could make the game funner for everybody and without turbo building you will have to be a smarter player instead of holding down a mouse and spinning in circles.

You would have to be careful about wasting materials and be very precise with your builds, there are lots of unhappy players at the moment in the game or to put it better people who are upset with the current spray metas, I would imagine the spray metas would be less effective if there was more variety of weapon choices, if materials were easier to farm and players would have to be more careful with the materials it could be better in terms of a skill gap but also not unfair to inexperienced players who dont build anyway, or dont rely on it.

I dont know what is best for this game but this is not the full potential for it, If Epic are so focused on making this game funner for newer players why do they want to make it so much easier for the advanced players to destroy the newer ones and no it does not make it easier for newer players to build because the fact is they are going to get destroyed anyway, either way with or without turbo building there is a real skill gap so what is there to lose?

Like i said i dont know what is best for the game but i want them experiment and try things that are different to fortnites current state.

Thanks, i would really like some other OPINIONS on what other think and also any suggestions, like you all i just want what is best for this game and im not sure what it is but maybe we can find out.

The game feels too much like an experiment. The current method of using extremes is bad. It would be great if they used it on extra testing servers or LTMs but they use it in the main game. The game will stay relevant without weekly complaints about insane changes. I'd definitely prefer soft changes and especially an explanation of building nerfs that seem to never end.

The road trip skin has woken up and the Fortnite map is still colliding with other worlds. To fix this the rift skin will bring the the visitor back through the portal in the rocket. The rocket will land in wailing woods. Due to the power of the hop rocks the rocket will blow up. Wailing woods will become a nuclear waste land with dead trees, green mushrooms, including the mysterious vault which will not be damaged. The visitor skin will seal the crack turning the desert area to moisty. The Viking area will be gone and dusty divot will be turned back to dusty depot. The visitor will return to his planet.

- hop rocks will now become green and radioactive (epic team is not sure what they will do if consumed yet)
- One idea is they will make you lose damage the longer you are in a small area around a single hop rock but on consumption you will get super speed
- Super speed will most likely be as fast as the golf cart if implemented into the game
The hop rocks radiation will spread through lonely lodge turning it into a wasteland. With radiated mushrooms and radiated hop rocks. (these rocks do not have a proper name yet). The radiation will spread to moisty finally turning the leviathan skin into a giant radiated monster. We will finally be adding the leviathan game mode after scrapping it due to leakers. Finally the new battle pass will add a legendary upgradable skin. He will be a adventurer who will upgrade to a wastelander with (power armor?). This is our top idea but we are not sure what to name it yet. The tier 100 skin will be a bounty hunter similar to Boba Fett from Star Wars (upgradable).

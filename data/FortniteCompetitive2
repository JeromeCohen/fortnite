I think it's very close to being ready for release and would like some feedback from the competitive sub, especially since there have been a few trending topics recently where this community has been asking for a game mode like this.

Here's a screenshot of the mini map + expert MS Paint map key:

A view from the South/West of the castle and damage zones:

View from the East of the castle and damage zones (messed up MSPainting the pink zone, it is supposed to extend all the way to the brown zone - oops):

https://i.imgur.com/jQf95sN.png

#Basic rules:

-The main objective must be protected for 10 minutes for the defenders to win

-Defenders are immune to all damage zones protecting the castle; attackers receive 20 dmg/s inside zones

-Attackers spawn in a forest base with cannons for quick access to different pressure points of the castle

This game mode is best fit for 6v6 or 8v8 - it's a fairly large castle map. Defenders will only have success if they work together and manage their damage zones upkeep. If too many damage zones are destroyed by attackers, there will be many angles for the attackers to advance from, making it much more difficult to protect the main objective at the top of the castle. 

Zones are removed when their zone generator tile is destroyed. These are most easily destroyed from underneath, as the zone never extends below the tile the generator is placed on. All zone generators are marked with red beacons that reach from the generator location to the sky in game. The main objective is marked with a blue sky beacon.

#The Meta

-All players spawn with 500/250/0

-All players spawn with blue combat, blue silenced SMG, blue AR, blue bolt action sniper, 3 minis

-Blue pumps spawn in bases for free if player desires to swap their combat out for a pump

-100 wood, 50 brick, 10 metal granted on elimination directly to inventory

-Metal is used as currency in this game mode; its farm availability is very rare on the map, and little is granted on elimination. You can choose to build with it, but you will not be able to afford upgrades.

     +Weapon shop items = 20 metal per

          =2 grey grenades
          =1 boogie bomb
          =3 impulses
          =green flint knock
          =blue scoped AR
          =blue infantry rifle
          =minigun - potentially up for a vault from this mode, need more testing (currently only purple weapon, but light ammo availability is low)

     +Trap shop items = 50 metal per 

          =2 Bounce Pads
          =1 Spike Trap

     +Shield shop items = 30 metal per

          =3 minis
          =1 big pot
          =1 slurp

#Memory Optimized for Performance

One important trick I learned while creating this map is that the less ""unique"" pieces you use to construct everything, the better. More prefabs = more memory usage, whereas when you custom build everything from only a handful of pieces taken from only a couple of prefabs, vast areas can be built while maintaining low memory. This map uses 52k of the allotted 100k units. When floating up in the sky and looking down at all the zones and the entire castle, I still get 160-180 fps. Throughout the map internally, I have a consistent 200-240 fps. Haven't had any glitches, hitches, or bugs in play-testing yet.

#More Screenshots / Full Walk-through Video

Upper main zone shield (red on minimap key): https://i.imgur.com/goNYhYm.png

This upper main damage zone is protected by a ""shield generator"" that cannot be shot, built, or walked through. The shield generators must first be destroyed from underneath to destroy the upper main zone generator.

**Full video walkthrough** 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZWzB8pEu4k

**Misc. Notes**

I designed these zones to overlap in very specific ways, in order to force attackers to approach the main objective from designed angles. The game is meant to be balanced with multiple options for attackers; plowing directly through the upper and lower main zones is not the only way to the main objective. Specific combinations of zone attacks open up new avenues to the top of the castle.

For example, there is a hidden tunnel connecting to the main throne room all the way from the Eastern mountain stairs that can be accessed after destroying the East zone. But it is a bottle necked are and if defenders are playing with good awareness, the tunnel will only be useful for strategic sneak attacks once opened up. You can see what I'm talking about if you watch the video walkthrough starting at the 3:50 point.

The meta is meant to be low on splodes since destroying the main objective would be a bit too easy for attackers. The time limit may be adjusted to longer than 10 minutes potentially. Other meta shifts might include item/weapon/shield costs and amount of metal currency dropped by players. Currently infinite respawn is allowed; if this game mode became competitive, it may be worth instilling a ~5 life limit to increase the value of protecting and resurrecting DBNO players.

Final note: The currency system is not currently active since custom vending machines have not yet been added to creative, but WILL be soon according to Epic staff in the official Creators' invite-only discord. All of the information shared by Epic staff in there has been highly reliable and I have no doubt we'll have custom vending machines soon enough. As such, all item spawns are currently *free* with long respawn times to prevent abuse, and 0 metal is dropped per elimination. Once custom vending machines are added, the indicated item costs will be installed and 10 metal per elimination granted. 

Open to any and all feedback and anyone that would like to play test before release.",FortniteCompetitive

I haven’t played at all barely for S9 and finally had enough at the end of S8 after stretched removed, siphon, and ballers and the pump removal just topped it off along with changing tilted towers and retail to a clusterfuck and those slipstreams are awful.

(Also I don’t care if combat iS bETtEr tHaN pUmp, it’s not the same and didn’t need changed)

They need to do some season where the map just gets reset all the way back to S4 and just make the theme time travel and basically just restart from S4.

I doubt it’s possible but just something similar needs to happen. I still want to play this game but can’t stand it anymore.

I want to build battle, I want to outplay people, I want fair fights with siphon (everyone’s basically got shield), and being honest I don’t want to play a comp/arena mode and sit in boxes but that’s just my opinion.

I miss just being able to chill on this game with friends, now it’s either you sweat your ass off in arena for useless ranks that everyone can get with a baller anyways, or you lose your sanity in pubs",FortniteCompetitive

I played for a few hours last night and I must say that I enjoyed the new res way more than I thought I would. Targets were easier to hit, 1x1 fighting felt better, and the extra frames are always nice.

 So I’m wondering if anyone else has seriously considered trying stretched since they changed it. As of right now, I’m sticking to 1600x1080 and may mess around and see what the other stretches look like.",FortniteCompetitive

A simple map, a simple and BALANCED set of weapons, reasonable mobility, and way less RNG. At this point I'm convinced that they are operating on some marketing philosophy that encourages sporadic or unbalanced changes to either keep the game relevant and 'interesting' or assist and retain new players.

**How is it possible that the directional audio is worse than before?** I used to be able to tell where a fight was happening around me 95% of the time, and now have no idea. So now, not only is the vertical audio messed up, but the horizontal as well. Why does the gunfire audio now have a strange layer of reverb and sound muffled?

**OP weapons are still abundant. How is boom bow is still in the game doing 100 damage? Proximity grenades are a joke.** Out of everything they've added proximity grenades might take the cake. No aim required, huge damage, fires fast. It's just so dumb that it actually made it into the game. People joke about homing missile being added but at this point I honestly would not be surprised at all.

**There's still too much of the wrong types of mobility exasperating third partying.** All of the mobility they've added has made the game so much more annoying. It's like everyone forgets about certain problems in the game and eventually just gets used to them. Doesn't anyone remember the ""third party meta"", what happened to that? It hasn't gone away, Epic hasn't done much to change it, and in fact it's made worse with mobility EVERYWHERE. Unless your a very high level player your not going to survive a fight with a guy who glides onto you immediately after finishing a fight 90% of the time. Especially if that player is as almost as good as or better than you, with full hp. All of that time looting and getting mats, gone, because someone waited in the distance and glided on top of you as soon as you finished your fight. It was stupid last year when people started complaining about it and it still is. **Yes, it used to suck having to rotate from the edge of the map, but it was apart of the game and actually added to the fun and strategy of the game**. To make it worse is the fact that you can't hear people gliding on top of you in some cases until they're basically right beside you. If you can hear them, the audio is so bad you're looking around in circles trying to see where the mystery glider sound is coming from until you realize **a)** there's nobody even near you, or **b)** they're right on top of/beside you. Another issue is players hopping out of ballers and getting shots on you before it even registers on your screen that they've hopped out! Mobility is needed, just don't make the third partying worse.

**There has to be something about Epic's corporate culture, marketing, or management that is ruining this game.** How is there's always some outrageous set of problems with the game at any given time? They fix some of them and then they return worse or they add ten more. I stopped playing after they added the bow and the game has somehow gotten worse. No shotguns and proximity launchers, with balers still in the game. 

**When this game works it amazing, but that's literally less then 25% of the time. The rest of the time it's is just filled with annoyances that certain people at Epic are making worse with every passing update.** 

* Not finding shields or decent weapons after looting for ten minutes. 
* Getting constantly third partied and immediately rushed after fights. 
* Ridiculously OP and unbalanced weapons and items. 
* Audio GETTING WORSE ever time they say they have improved it. 
* Ping based wall retake system.
* Jitters and 'lag' that cause my builds to not place
* The game placing on tiles where I'm not even aiming
* Sick of all of poi's getting replaced, and the scrambled map we have now

***and on, and on, and on, and on...***

Overall in it's current state Fortnite just isn't the same as it was in seasons 2-5. The constant updates, even if for the better for competitive maybe, have just changed the game to a point where it's just not the same. All of these improvements and changes compound until we're left with something much different from what we started with. Pubs just feel way different, and the competitive modes are kind of a wreck. The turtle scrim endgame meta can be fun, but is that even really what Fornite was? Whatever happened to four story one by ones and bases in the final ten, with everyone shooting rockets and crouch shooting scars at each other? 

I know it sounds like a joke, but I'm serious. There might have been ways to prevent this current turtle, 20 layer skybase, moving circle meta. In favor of something more akin to the first seasons endgame, which seemed 100% more fun and less of an rng shit show. For instance what if in the last zone sky limit was only 5 tiles? What if the map split into four storms, which shrunk until there were only 5 left in each and then converged? What if the final circle didn't move but went back to just shrinking? What if there we're only 50 people in a lobby, possibly on a different map? There are a lot of possibilities. 

Competitive has/had so much potential, but even as someone who has put a ton of time into this game, competitive just doesn't have much appeal anymore. I think back when the skill ceiling was lower and maybe everyone thought maybe they could be 'one of the best' if they put the work in added to the allure. But seeing how it's been going for most of the pros isn't really convincing for anyone to grind it out to try and 'make it' anymore. Aside from all the problems with the game itself, and all of the weird politics surrounding competitive. To top it off the official broadcasts are just cringey and almost unwatchable.

 It seems like this sub has been for filled with constant complaining for months. It started with the p90, and the 'different playstyles' updates, then there was fornitemeres, then the sword, and it just hasn't stopped. I get it, and I agree, but for whatever reason some people at Epic have this idea for the game that a lot of us just don't get. But all in all, I don't even know if fixing all of these issues will every really 'fix' Fortnite or bring it back to it's prime. That charm and novelty of the game is gone for a lot of us probably. It might just be because we've played for hundreds or even thousands of hours and at this point no matter what Epic does, the game will never have that same vibe or feeling that the earlier seasons had.",FortniteCompetitive

All the way through seasons 1-5, I've loved the game. It was amazing to play, and the loot pool was fair. You could get into fair fights in the early game where both you and your opponent had about the same weapons. Season 9, however, is horrible. 50% of my games I get into a fight where I fight a player with a combat shotgun while I have 5 semi-autos. Every single time I ramp up a mountain, I get shot for all my shields with little Timmy's boom bow. The proximity launcher guarantees my shields off. Epic decides to keep the SMGs balanced, but their explosive items/weapons keep growing in number. Epic had a chance to fix this. They had a chance to listen to us. They didn't. I'm leaving Fortnite.

I finally stopped playing Fortnite, haven't picked it up in almost 2 months. The grass really is greener","This isn't a hate post or a rant, this is for everyone who is more or less done with the game but can't take that final step....

Do it. Just do it already guys. As a console player since season 1, I learned that without a PC, I can practice as much as I want but the hardware difference is insurmountable. So I had to ask myself, ""Do I save up for a PC so I can reach my full potential?"" and then we all realized something...EPIC doesn't listen to the community or give af about its competitive mode so why should I spend the time, money, and effort? 

So one day....I just played a different game and the rest is history. Guys, I guess my main advice/takeaway  here is to just play another game. Get back into open world games or if that isn't your style then just play a different shooter or 2k or FIFA. Literally anything else. It's hard at first but it gets very easy after that first week. 
For me personally, I switched over to Days Gone (super fun game) next on the queue is Assassin's Creed, then Resident Evil and then....idk maybe some Crash Bandicoot? 

See fortnite hooked so many of us because it was insanely fun. Nowadays, it's more annoying and frustrating than it is fun but a lot of us are loyal addicts so it's hard to abandon a game that had/still has so much potential. Which is why I still check this sub and the main one from time to time, just to stay up to date and hoping that EPIC will start caring about ALL of its players. 

TL;DR: If you're not having fun or making money playing Fortnite, quit the game and find another one. It's difficult as first but once you find other games you like (and you will) you will thank yourself. If EPIC starts listening and actually improving the game, then come back. If you don't quit, you're just feeding the beast.",FortniteCompetitive

And, to me, he wastes a lot of what he has. For example, last night, I watched his stream, and he wasted like 400 steel building a tower, just to edit down out of it. Didn't even use it to look around. He literally blocked it off with a roof, and went back down.

I don't want to watch Ninja just because there's always so many people, that it feels like I'm watching a TV show, not a stream. I know it's hard for him to interact with all those people at once.

**Also made separate topics as you can see so you don't have to read it all of it just the ones you actually need to improve on, but if you want to read it all feel free ofc.** 

&amp;#x200B;

1. ***Practice isn't what makes perfect, it's GOOD practice that makes perfect***

&amp;#x200B;

So I hang out in some Twitch streams whenever i'm not playing and I see a lot of people ask the streamers ""I play for 8+ hours a day and i'm not getting better, why"" and here's the reason for this. So a lot of people think if they just play the game numerous hours they will just magically get better at the game but that's not really how things work. I mean sure you can play the game for like 10 hours a day and call it a 'grind' but if every single time you die you don't look back at the mistakes you did that got you killed, mistakes you've done during that game in general regardless if you win the game/fight, it's not going to do much. I see a lot of players make excuses when they die and I can understand that but in every single game you play there's always something you could of done better regardless if you won the fight against that player you were build battling or won the entire game in general. So when you do die you have to think and look back and a good way to do this is is by using the replay system to see your in debt gameplay and record your actual gameplay. 

&amp;#x200B;

***2. Balancing your time***

&amp;#x200B;

playing creative all day isn't going to help you improve overall at the game, sure it may help with things like building, 

editing speed and bit of aiming but it's not going to help you improve your actual game sense. Most fights in creative to begin with aren't even realistic, if you're doing build fights all the way to height limit that would be a horrible idea to do in comp or playing with legendary weapons you probably won't find in comp until the very late game if you get lucky and these like these, are just too unrealistic things that won't happen in an actual game. I like to make my creative fights more realistic, put yourself in a bad situation maybe only have only a certain amount of mats to fight with, give yourself only like a grey/green ar and a blue combat or green tac and not above 150 shield so it can be more realistic to actual in game fights. Now sure pro's practice a ton in creative but not just creative, they balance their game time well, the best of the best players all have a good balance between the 3 main things you need for good effective practice which are balancing your time between 1. Creative Practice 2. Reviewing your vods/Gameplay and 3. Playing the actual game. All 3 are the most important things you have to balance between to be the best player you can be, say you do for example 3 hours creative 3 vod reviews and another 3hrs playing. 9 Hours of good effective practice, doing too much of just 1 isn't going to help you improve overall, say you do like 6 hours playing creative, just too much and it's something a lot of players do just because they get frustrated playing the actual game but than they wonder why they're not qualifying and winning games. 

&amp;#x200B;

***3. Improving at Aim***

&amp;#x200B;

Practicing aim for console - For practicing aim on console there's a number of things you can do, first being creative courses but it's very important you find a console friendly aim course on creative with moving bots to trigger aim assist as practicing without aim assist is different and not needed. On controller you also have a deadzone setting, make sure you go to creative and make sure you're comfortable with your deadzone settings and sensitivity as it can have a huge impact on your aim overall. You can also try to get a better controller or kontrol freaks thumb grips to make you more comfortable when aiming on your joystick. 

&amp;#x200B;

Practicing aim for PC - For PC you can try all type of creative courses and have a more bigger variety of choices are you aim very differently with a mouse with a choice of a higher sens and no aim assist and easier to do things such as flick shots etc for some players. PC players also have the choice of using third party software's and aim trainer games to improve their mouse aim and tracking overall, kovakks if good for practicing your mouse aim and there's plenty of others out there that you can try and some are even free too but most probably kovakks is the best one you can buy, it goes around 10 dollars on stream, as I said there's also free ones but if you're more serious and want the best effective training possible to truly get better, this is probably one of the ones you can get. 

&amp;#x200B;

Improving aim overall - This counts for both PC and console and any platform really is just to practice your aim in games and you can also try playing playlists like Team Rumble where there's constant action so you constantly shoot at people to practice aim and you can also respawn so you can get good practice for quite a good amount of time and also since players glide when respawning there's a good amount of players constantly gliding which you can shoot at to practice your tracking. What I sometimes do is if I want to practice my aim with a specific weapon, I only use that weapon in Team rumble for example if I only want to practice my AR aim, I just use a normal green ar for the entire game. Your sensitivity is also a huge factor on aiming, make sure you're comfortable with your sens to have good tracking and aim, go to creative and in an aim course and test out your sens to see if you're comfortable with it and can easily hit shots, if you feel like it's you're trying to track but constantly going outside of the players hitbox, try lowering and if you're trying to track onto something but your going too slow, try turning it up a little bit each time until you find the perfect sensitivity for you. I suggest looking what works best for you, there's no such thing as the perfect sens so stop trying to copy pro players sensitivity and settings as different people have different styles, find what works best for you and stick with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***4. Improve Building***

&amp;#x200B;

\- For building mainly just go to creative as well and practice build fights with good/decent players or players better than you or the same level as you ( practicing against little Timmy who can barely build a ramp is not going to help you improve btw ) and practice build battles against each other but make sure you make them realistic so no like god tier loot like legendary scars and gold combats and all, it's ok to not have fall damage enabled and go to the height limit since you're practicing building but try not to make it too unrealistic, build as if you were in an actual game. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Of course there's also a ton of build courses you can do or just mainly go into a regular map of yours and practice doing random builds around and all but mainly doing build battles with others is what is going to help you the most with build battles and other things like aim and editing speed at the same time too but mainly building, depends on your play style. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Look at different building techniques pro's use and try using them yourself, first practice doing them a couple of times in creative then try to do them in an actual game but make sure you don't overbuild and only build what's necessary as you don't want to waste mats and time. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***5. Improve Editing*** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- For editing there's not much to it it's mainly just doing it over and over again, go into edit courses and practice editing over and over until you get the hang of it, also important to have a good sense so you can feel comfortable editing, too slow sens can make you miss edits and too fast sens can also make you miss edits, on console make sure to have a good deadzone to be good with your edits but other than that just make sure you practice editing over and over everyday for some minutes, I also do a lot of edits I don't need to do in game say I make a ramp and I edit it and reset it just for the fun and practice of doing it randomly can help. 

&amp;#x200B;

***6. Game knowledge*** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Running around the map like a headless chicken isn't something that pro's do, you have to pay attention to the different routes you're taking, plan out where you're going to rotate too and why, you also want to have good map awareness which you get by mainly playing, basically knowing where all the chests/ammo boxes of the place you're looting are perfectly, having a good set out planned route for the places you land and where you want to go afterwards, having a backup plan when you have to change your route for when you get contested, knowing were all the spawns are for everything like apples/mushrooms/banana's/coconuts/chili peppers and natural campfires etc. Also important to be aware of your surroundings when looting and running around, make sure you're constantly looking 360 degrees everywhere when looting and running in the open, I usually do a 360 and look around me if for example i'm taking apples in the open to avoid getting sniped and such, be aware of your surroundings well and constantly to not get sniped or snuck up on. You mainly practice good game sense and everything that I mentioned by playing the game yourself with a mixture of watching good players/streamers play the game as well, I learned a lot just by watching a few minutes of different good players or BallaTW a commentator that vod reviews all the pro's gameplay after the world cup qualifiers that you can learn a lot from by seeing for example even just a very small detailed thing like a small thing in a specific part of the map that when you break you get a lot of mats to even something bigger like a really good technique you never taught of before etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

***7. Learn from the best***

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sometimes the best way to improve is just watching the best of the best players play, take BallaTW for example, he barely even plays the game that much he just does vod reviews on pro's, yet he's insane at the game because he always analysis movements and what they do to qualify and get so good at the game. You can learn to much just by watching pro players alone just play the game itself, there's also a ton of YouTube channels that give out new tips on new items and such every time they come out or new techniques that get discovered every time so always stay up to date with the latest stuff that gets added or changed into this game because it happens often so to be the best of the best you HAVE to adapt constantly to new things and stay up to date constantly otherwise you'll fall back. For pro players and streamers competing in competitive Fortnite tourneys and the world cup etc, just search up the players who qualified or were very close and watch their streams and for some Youtube/Twitch channels I suggest are TheGamerCouple, ItsJerian, Geerzy, BallaTW, and Pro guides ( they also have a free course online that you can try out to improve ), But for the most advanced competitive serious players, watching BallaTW'S streams and videos is the best there is 100 percent. 

&amp;#x200B;

***8. Tip I learned from Balla***

&amp;#x200B;

\- Something that Balla also taught me is that some deaths go way back, say you make a small mistake in the very start of the game, that small little mistake could lead to having a very bad game and causing you lose the entire game so sometimes to improve when looking at vods, go back to the start and see for yourself what got you in that situations, why don't you have any shield, did you get a bad landing and barely have any loot, did you have bad self awareness when farming and not looking around and you got tagged by someone and lost all your shield, how did you end up in such a bad situation and what could of you done to not be in that situation, stop making excuses and start pushing yourself, you may not be as good as you think you are, sometimes yea we die by things we can't avoid but you have to stop blaming the game every time you die and whine and make excuses and start having a good mindset, otherwise you'll never achieve anything with a bad mindset of always blaming the game and never yourself. Even say you died by a bug, it's unfortunate and it sucks it really does but at least you know what triggers the bug and until it's fixed, you pay attention to avoid doing that thing that triggers the bug to occur.

&amp;#x200B;

***9 .  Stop having a big ego***

&amp;#x200B;

\- Just going to make this one plain and simple, stop thinking your some type of God at the game, just because you have a lot of wins in pubs and kills on bots doesn't make you a good player, just because you spend 6 hours everyday in creative practicing your edits and thinking you're the fastest controller editor and building doesn't mean you're good, stop thinking you're so good when you never truly achieved anything, when you never earned any earning from tourneys or barely reached champions in Arena which also isn't impressive at all btw, i'm not even that good myself and I can get to div 7, I see a so many people think they're so good at this game because they kill bots easily in pubs and have fast builds or edits in creative and stay uploading montages on YouTube with titles saying they're a god and the vid is just them doing 90's for 5 minutes straight, not even pro's have a big ego, sure they have an ego cause you have to be confident in fights and games, they're confident they're always going to win the fight, they're not scared but they're not over confident and too cocky, I cannot tell you how many times I run into a soccer skin and they just spam builds randomly and dance and get too cocky and over confident just cause they got me low than I clap them, it's hilarious.  Basically don't be too hard on yourself it's ok to say you're a good player but don't say you're ""A goated cranked controller god"" basically. 

&amp;#x200B;

***10. Stay focused and calm under pressure***

&amp;#x200B;

\- I see a lot of players that just because they are for example in solo squads and getting spammed by 4 players with a drum gun at the same time or they get heavy sniped or boom bowed or anything like that, they start getting tilted and heated and they lose all their focus, they get angry and they don't think straight, watch the best pub stompers and solo squad players, watch nixxxay ( 1st in kills overall ), replays, HD, Ninja, Tfue, etc, all of them when they're 1 vs 4, they stay focused and calm under the pressure when being spammed by little timmy spamming all 12 rockets of an rpg, Jimmy with a minigun, TTV\_xXpUSsyDestroyexXx spamming his drum gun and Xx420VapeLord69Xx using 50 bullets for that 1 heavy sniper body shot for his YouTube Montage. Even when you're low HP, you can always clutch it up, never give up until you die, always give it your best shot no matter how shit the position you are in is, you may have 0 mats on 1hp against a sweaty squad, the chances of winning is very very low but they may know you're so low and low on everything so they get cocky and over confident and you can take advantage of that and clutch up the win, happened multiple of times before. Also make sure you don't play when tilted and angry, you won't focus very well when heated and angry so if you die and get really mad, try taking a short brake and cool off for a few seconds or minutes or hours and come back later. 

&amp;#x200B;

***11. Remembering the past mistakes you've done*** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- A lot of players can forget the past mistakes they done in their past games, they may know they're doing a mistake but they don't remember what to do in that situation and do the same mistakes over and over, this can be avoided easily, if you're really serious and improving and can't remember your mistakes and the techniques you either learn yourself or by pro's, try writing down on a paper and ( very imp ) re read what you wrote a couple of times over and over for a few days until you get it in your head and than you automatically remember it so you can use the techniques you learn and learn from your past mistakes to stop doing them when you get in a similar scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

***12. Stop focusing on improving your stats***

&amp;#x200B;

\- Focus on actually improving yourself, focusing on getting a higher KD isn't going to help you improve at the game, no pro player focuses on his stats, wins, kd etc... Say you camp all game in a pub and win the game with like 1 kill and call it a victory, sure I mean you won the game no matter what a win is a win but did you really improve that game? Did you learn anything? I mean sure it's annoying to die top 2 but at least you learned something from dying, you can always learn something new every time you die and lose to help you get better for your future games, the more you lose the better you can get, that's the mindset you gotta have in mind, losing is only an illusion, losing is what real winning is in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Alright so that pretty much covers it, there's some more stuff there and there but this should be enough to help any type of player improve at the game, so yea if this helped you in any way or think it can at least be helpful to others, please do leave an upvote as this took me like 2 hours of my day just for the purpose of helping others constantly making posts and asking streamers and people how can they improve and if they have any 'tips' to get better etc. So there you have it, hope you guys learned something from this or think it can be helpful to other players and thank for you reading, much love guys.",FortniteCompetitive

The removal of stretched res was the most annoying thing for me (and ballers), but I managed to enjoy the game despite of that. But I have not been able to cope with the changes that have been made in this season and have because of that stopped playing the game.

I just don't get it why they are making this game so much rng, 80% of gunfights are bloomfights and the lootpool is so bad. When I was a noob I was always getting destroyed by better players, but that didn't bother me at all, I was just playing this game to have fun with my friends, and enjoyed the game in that way. But then I got better and enjoyed playing this game competitively so I started to enjoy more the competitive aspect then just messing around and having fun. But now I can't enjoy this game because of broken weapons and broken lootpool. 

 And the most overseen thing in my opinion is how garbage the map is, snow biom and the forest part of the map are so bad imo, the old map was so much better. You can just land anywhere and then rotate anywhere on the map in like 20 seconds. It was so much better when rotation was limited and you actually had to spare a few braincells to think about rotating.

I could go on forever, but It's just so annoying to not be able to enjoy the game you fell in love with. We went from stretched res, decent guns and loot to this :(",FortniteCompetitive

Shotguns-
The shotgun state in season 9 is just atrocious, if one player has a combat and the other a tac, the player with the combat( assuming they are equally skilled) wins 9/10 times. The best and easiest solution to fix this would to be replace the tac with the pump. The pump is just a better shotgun then the tac for outputting damage up close, which would be a perfect counter for the combats mid-range playstyle.The pump would need to be changed to grey and green rarity and the combat to green blue purple, to ensure everyone would have a shotgun off spawn.

Pop up Cups-
I would add consistent weekly pop up cups, with world cup qualifiers ending soon, weekly pop up cups would be a perfect replacement for them. Twice a week they would be perfect for competitive play and would hopefully have some type of payout for doing good.

Fixing Bugs-
There are so many easy bugs that would be out of the game if there wasn't such a heavy focus on other things such as comsetics, like the mid air rift shot should be out already, just in general bugs should a top priority.

Loot pool-
The loot pool is one of the worst it's ever been. It's way overloaded with explosives, and not enough smgs or shotguns. There should be different loot pools from regular br to arena, stuff like the heavy sniper and rpg should be removed from competitive play and only be kept in regular br, as they are very unblanced and are too versatile. Guns like the semi sniper and regular pistols should be removed for being too underpowered, and guns like the suppressed smg and bolt action sniper should be unvaulted in all gamemodes.

That's what I would try to accomplish and put in motion if I was a developer for a day. Tell me what you do in a day as developer.",FortniteCompetitive

The range and fire rate of it makes going up against this thing with a tac extremely frustrating. To me, the combat is simply the tac shotgun on steroids. Theres no reason to have 2 shotguns with high fire rates in this game especially when one is so much worse then the other. This is how I think the shotgun meta could be fixed. 

• Vault The Tac Shotgun

Like I said, no reason for this gun to be in the game. Its simply a worse version of the combat. No matter how hard Epic tries this shotgun will never be relevant. 

• Unvault The Green and Blue Pumps

This would make complete sense. Two shotguns to choose from, the combat for a fast fire rate and increased range or a pump for the ability to inflict alot of damage and even 1 tap with good aim. According to Epic, they vaulted the pump due to it getting a substantial amount of eliminations but I'm betting the combat is accounting for around the same percent or maybe more because of its range. With this change theres a clear risk vs. reward to using one shotgun or the other and not a clear winner like there is currently.",FortniteCompetitive

Adapting to new environments, metas, guns etc. Epic has constantly been adding/removing items and places since the very first couple of seasons. They do this so the gaming community that currently plays their game doesn’t get bored while still attracting new players to the game. They have no problem with a couple of competitive players being angry with the game while they have hundreds of new players that constantly keep joining. In fact, it’s a brilliant business strategy that really allowed them to get this big. The best part is people like you guys will constantly complain about every change, yet still play the game that the made. You continually give Epic your time and money. Epic has consumed such a large share of the market and has dominated the gaming community you think that “we have to play Fortnite.” No, no you don’t. There are thousands of other games and game developers out there that would be glad to have your business. But Epic has you and most of the community’s balls in a vice grip that you’d rather complain and play their game than try out a different game. It’s an open market with free choice, but everyone keeps coming back to Fortnite - brilliant business strategy. Why do you think Call of Duty and the EA sports series have to come out with a new game every year? It’s cause people get bored of the same maps, same guns and same features. Epic has done something amazing and have people so involved in there game that they will never have to release another “Fortnite 2.0” because of the constant changes and updates to their game so people don’t get bored. They have taken the idea of DLC from GTA and other games and made a whole game of the idea. The only way this strategy fails is if you people that complain take your business elsewhere, unfortunately that does not happen. If you really want to make your voice heard, learn to adapt and get good with the current Meta. The quicker you guys get good and learn to play with the current changes - the quicker they will release updates to pivot to the next Meta. Also, what’s the point of complaining on here? Not a chance that Epic will respond to you and will actually take what you said to heart. Stop wasting your time. If you are really having that bad of a time - go find another game. I personally find it very fun to relearn new skills and strategy’s each season and update. It keeps you on your toes and you basically have to relearn a new game.

But the amount of combat shotguns a particular player finds will strongly correlate with how well they‘ll do overall. In online qualifiers you at least have the chance to find and kill a bad player who has a combat, but good luck trying to kill mongraal in NYC with a grey tac while he has a combat. There will be players who only get like 1 or 2 combat shotguns total. They are practicing all day now not knowing that they already lost. In my opinion the top 10 will have a significantly higher per game percentage of getting a combat shotgun compared to the bottom 50%.

Each time they change the meta I would try and justify their decisions ""oh they're just experimenting to find the most balanced meta possible."" 

The assumption that Epic is looking for a magical ""balanced meta"" came from my experience with games like Call of Duty and Halo. Upon the release of these games the dev teams would work hard to establish a meta that is fair and balanced for their respective competitive communitys. On the rare occasion that new weapons were added, they were oftentimes excluded from competitive play. 

That being said I think Epic is looking at the lifespan of their game differently then COD and Halo. Fortnite is not a one year cycle game and they are treating the their weapon metas accordingly. They want to keep their gameplay feeling continually fresh to ensure their game isn't just a one year cycle game. 

This disparency between the life cycles of previous AAA titles and they way they handled their respective meta changes has caused a great deal of frustration in the Fortnite community. 

Personally, I don't think Epic will ever implement a static and balanced meta. I think it is much more likely that their goal is to establish meta cycles in much smaller time frames to ensure fresh gameplay. I see this reflected in the removal  of the Pump and the addition of the Combat as well as other numerous meta changes. 

Do others feel like this is a fair assumption? My opinions are oftentimes flawed so I appreciate counterarguments.",FortniteCompetitive

Stink Bombs-Just annoying endgame and also no one uses them unless they cant find other utility anyway 

All explosive apart from normal Grenades - end game when people are on low mats its very annoying and creates too much contesting around supply drops from the people who want it for heals 

Tactical Shotgun-There IS NO SITUATION where the tactical can beat the combat 

Semi-auto sniper rifle- NO USE in competitve play also doesnt reward accuracy because u can spam it and when u do hit shots they dont reward in high enough damage 

Heavy Sniper rifle-JUST OP 

Drum-gun-Has no use anymore after nerf its useless and uses up ar ammo and a slot which could be used in a much better way 

Minigun-JUST USELESS 

Un-vault:

Bolt Action Sniper rifle-Clearly one of the favorite sniper rifles that have been in fortnite,theres no reason for only one sniper in the game

Green and blue pump shotgun- After vaulting the tactical shotgun and after the combat shotgun being the only viable shotgun, it would be a fair and balanced difference between the combat and the pump

Silenced Submachine Gun- After the Vaulting of the drum gun in would only be fair that the most balanced close-ranged gun made a return to Fortnite

Buff:

Bolt Action sniper rifle because the silenced sniper should'nt do the same damage as the Bolt and also have a silencer 

Mini Shields the carry size should be increased to atleast 8 as many players are carrying slurp juices and big shields over these items.

Siphon should be buffed to 100 Health per kill after the third circle and the materials you get should automatically be added to your inventory

Nurf:

The Storm Surge Should only work whilst your in the storm and create a safe zone on the minimap

Bugs: JUST FIX THEM!

It's just the most dominant cqb weapon right now because they're not in the game.","The most broken aspect of the combat is the insane range. You can hit someone for like 50 damage from far away and quickly. But why is the pump and heavy better than the combat you ask? The **Pullout delay** of the combat is the main thing. Have you noticed that doing edit plays now results in taking more damage than before? That's because of how long it takes to pull the combat shotgun out compared to these shotguns. People keep pointing to the firerate for their reasoning of why it's better than the pump but that's irrelevant if you edit, shoot someone, then reset your wall and stop taking 50/50 fights . Unless you're not building and editing, the pump and heavy are better because they have less delay and more burst damage. If you like to take 50/50 fights, the combat is more your style. DPS and firerate is completely irrelevant if you take advantage of building/editing and the burst damage of those weapons.

This post is basically just because I'm tired of seeing the recent circlejerk that the combat is the most broken shotgun when it really isn't except when it comes to range. Everytime Epic sees a post where people are saying how the combat is the best shotgun, they have less reason to bring them both back and we're stuck in this braindead 50/50 meta instead of the more skillful meta where edit plays were more viable and punishing.",FortniteCompetitive

You have no idea how satisfying it is to see people talk about it. Not only threads here, but having Vivid trying to come up with ideas concerning wall replacing (a few days ago, during his stream), Bizzle tweeting about it, as part of his 'fix fortnite' list of suggestion, or Ayden, playing on 70 ping and acknowledging that had he not been on 0 ping during the quals, he wouldn't have qualified.

Even if epic haven't addressed it yet, it's just very conforting to know that it's not a lost battle, as the community has finally had enough and is making a stance. Geographical location does not mean that we have to play in constant fear that this next guy who pushes us is a psycho who knows he has 0 ping and will claim your wall first try. Literally moving states/countries just to have 20 ping less makes absolutely no sense.

However, not many seem to come up with possible solutions (besides ""epic, fix this""), so I was hoping to hear your guys' thoughts on how this issue could be resolved.

I already mentioned one possible solution in my previous thread, a suggestion posted here a while ago (can't find the link, though): some sort of an 'ultimate' pickaxe swing mechanic. What it basically means, is that turbo-build would win 100% of the time (when trying to replace a wall manually and regularly), regardless of ping. However, you would have a new in-game swing option that would take longer to execute (as in, say a normal pickaxe swing takes 0.3 seconds, so this one will take 1 second or so), but is able to replace the wall 100% of the times. This way, you pretty much turn a ping advantage into an in-game mechanic, that is available to all.

First off for those of you who don't know me, my name is Nikolai I help run Atlantis Scrims NA and the practice server along with others. My time in this community has been spent on finding ways to provide the best practice for my peers. While I have slowly started to stray away from playing this game. I still continue to work everyday on finding ways to provide quality practice to this community and my peers.   


In that look for practice we have found that without some form of compensation that practice is never taken seriously. Unfortunately that is how this community is. With epics large prize pool and almost all exclusivity to running events it makes this very hard for us to provide compensated practice.   


As of recently we have been looking into running Leagues, Weekly Events and other ideas but are being held back by Epics restrictions on SAC events in their [SAC Online event License](https://www.epicgames.com/affiliate/en-US/page/online-event-license). Our biggest issue in going forward with this is funding. Our issue is not in finding funding we have reached out and are able to retrieve that funding. But the license states  

* The Online Event is not marketed or promoted using the name or trademark of a corporate sponsor;  


This causes some issues when finding funding. There is no ROI  (return on investment) for the sponsors. The license also states:

* Except as otherwise agreed by Epic in writing (including by email), an Online Event is licensed under these Terms only if it meets each of the following criteria  


I have reached out to epic games via all possible channels with little to no replies. My only response from epic was to contact [tournaments@epicgames.com](mailto:tournaments@epicgames.com) which I have done with still no reply. 

&amp;#x200B;

The state of competitive practice is terrible. The fact that zone rules need to be implemented just to simulate actual event endgames. The fact that our only epic provided practice (arena mode) is the exact opposite in terms of play style from the actual events. Its just awful. Why not allow us to get quality practice.   


We are even unable to get epics assistance in these events if we found a way to run them. Im not talking man power or broadcast. Im speaking of stat tracking with Server sided replays or even access to a better API for customs that allow us to track in real time players positions and statistics. Im asking you to provide the tools that we need to help make our practice better. But I feel this entire post will go unheard at epic games.  As we are promised over and over again that communication is coming but we are consistently let down time and time again.   


I love this game, this community and the opportunities it has given me. I've met or have spoken to some great people from epic who seem to want the best for the competitive scene and want our feedback. All I am asking is you help us get the practice we need. If you are against us running things ourselves then tell us! I honestly would be more upset of getting no response then a true honest answer. And if thats the case then please look into ways to provide daily practice for your game that actually simulates tournament environments. This game has changed the lives of so many people so please allow it to continue to provide that opportunity to new competitive players who are just looking to get better.",FortniteCompetitive

They've showed with the last updates that they want to change the meta from close combat to medium/long range. Limiting the FOV would supposedly make people avoid close combats because it's harder to see.

while Epic already heard a lot of opinions regarding the FOV in FN from the community I felt like that it wasn't really said what exactly is problematic about the current FOV.

1. Fortnite's most **skillful** and most **common** combat takes place **close range**.
2. building can obstructs the view realy easily while building
3. in a competitive match there are a lot more players alive at once and it can be pretty hard to comprehend what is going on to add to that the enemy's position can change constanly, they can hop over  your builds, be above and below you compared to other games this is pretty unusual.
4. a higher FOV would in a way compensation for suboptimal directional/ vertical sound and make it less troublesome to track players it would especially help in endgames.
5. a lower also FOV makes it more awkward to quickly switch between building and fighting and even deadly because you won't see the enemy for a few moments ,it discourages you to use one of the most significant skills in the game

&amp;#x200B;

countering Epic's counter arguments against a higher FOV/ agruments for low 80 FOV ([source](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-competitive-development-update))

&amp;#x200B;

1. *""Varied engagement ranges, favoring a low FOV and thus a closer view of enemies."" + ""Minimizing jarring transitions when aiming down sights.""\_* while making non ads FOV and ads FOV the same is a cool idea it doesn't fit a battle royale game at all because combat ranges vary from close to long range a lot and is just a extremly hypercritical argument
2. *""Minimizing potential motion-sickness in players further away from their screen. The further a player’s head moves from the center of the in-game field of view, the more negative the reaction."" \_* this is just false as studies show and bad game design ([article](https://pyroteq.com/field-of-view-first-person-shooters/))
3. *""Visual fidelity.""\_* Gameplay should always be more important than Graphics, again just a very hypercritical argument
4. *""Performance.""\_* this is the strongest argument of the bunch, but again just a little hypercritical. some potential remedies: 1st render distance scaling with FOV you don't need that much detail if you can't see it, 2nd there seem to be a lot of headroom for performance optimization in general, 3rd adding a new Pc client with mobile graphics (cap it on like 120 fps so it is only used by people who can't really run the normal version)

&amp;#x200B;

Not arguments but subjective experiences:

\- a friend of mine had to actually stop playing Fortnite after stretched was removed even tho he enjoyed it because after a few minutes he would get headache due to headtrauma he had as a child

Also let's not talk about epic's idiotic mentality that the worst players in the game that are 3 years old and have just downloaded the game on their iPad should have a chance of killing the best pros in the game. Also tbh all I play is creative zone wars and world cup for money since and whoever the fuck is behind all these dumb decisions, just fuck off and let other people with a working brain do it.",FortniteCompetitive

I just wanted to raise a question about Faze Sway who I've come to watch a lot recently since playing on console. He's known to be a creative god and its not difficult to see why since he spends the majority of his streams playing one vs ones in creative. I found out about him like a month ago and have been watching his clips and what not and I was impressed to say the least.

But after thinking, I am honestly confused to how its possible for him to be so mechanically good. Comparing him to other pro players (PC and console) his aim and building is absolutely impecable. I swear his aim is probably around 80% accuracy which is ridiculous and the majority of his shots are all headshots. It seems, he isn't even scared if the first gun he gets is an AK and his opponents have combats because he has so much faith in his aim. His edits are so smooth and he rarely makes mistakes. I'm personally confused about how accurate he seems to be with his right joystick especially on a high sens. My friend recently thought it was possible that he may have a modded controller so that he hits all those head shots but I don't imagine how someone could have a modded controller that is meant for aiming, building, running, and everything else that is so techinical.

I don't mean to accuse him since one, I am a big fan, and two, it's possible for him to just be nasty and I'm just trash at the game, but I just wanted to see what other people think. I also found it a bit odd that I've never seen another comment or post about the possibility of him using a modded controller. IDK, maybe I'm overanalyzing and looking for an excuse to his gameplay. But I encourage the readers of this post to watch his headshot accuracy and compare him to other console and pc players. I've spent quite a bit of time doing this and just find it baffling.

Let me know what you guys think!

As seen countless times such as when the drum gun won by a vast majority and the fact that r/fortnitebr has like a million more subscribers than here Epic has no choice but to try those best to retain the casuals. Epic constantly adds items to attempt to give casuals a better chance vs skilled players because if casuals feel like they always die without any chance to win they might quit the game and cause fortnite to lose players and money. So fortnite basically has no choice but to help casuals as much as possible or the game will die.",FortniteCompetitive

The strat is as follows:

When a player is boxed up, place a ramp behind you while trying to pick axe a wall. 

When the wall is at low health, fire your flintknock towards the bottom of your opponents wall.

The wall will break and the momentum of the flintknock shot will bounce you off your ramp and into their 1x1, even if they are turbo building.

It’s so sad to see Epic continue to make these awful updates. 

First they remove the pump shotgun from the game because it lead to 26% of eliminations. It was one of the most skill based weapons and wasn’t even a problem until they decided to add an Epic and Legendary variant that easily hit for 150-200+ damage. The green pump and blue pump were never broken and should still be in the game. Did anyone ever ask for a buffed pump to be in the game anyway??? 

Next they replace the pump with the combat shotgun which would easily account for over 26% if it didn’t have a 2% spawn rate. It does just as much damage as the green/blue pump but shoots twice as fast and has 10x the range. If you’re lucky enough to find one, you have a huge advantage over someone who doesn’t have one. Even the Tac shotgun (the only other shotgun in the game) is utterly useless against the combat shotgun. 

Next they take out the silenced smg and p90 because they didn’t want too many SMG’s and they replace them with a burst SMG which is easily the most useless weapon ever added into the game. I’d gladly take a six shooter or a revolver over a burst smg in any circumstance. 

And while they decided to limit the number of shotguns and smgs they significantly increase the amount of explosives and snipers. We now have 5 snipers and 5 explosive weapons. And they all take zero skill to use. An explosive bow that does 100+ splash damage, shows where the arrow will land, takes shotgun bullets, has infinite range and a 1 second reload time doesn’t belong a BR. They removed it from team rumble because it was so broken. A heavy sniper that does 150+ damage is almost always a kill because players rarely have max health. And today’s update: a grenade launcher for players who were too incompetent to use the regular grenade launcher. The trailer they dropped for it was utterly disgusting. 

And lastly, the competitive mode we have (Arena) is also a huge joke at this point. Arena has been out for a couple months now and they’ve never reset points. Literally anyone can get into the top division with enough time, a baller, stinks, and shadow grenades. It is pretty much pubs at this point. Every time I play arena I either encounter the worst players who literally just run away with their balls and shadow grenades or top tier players. It’s literally how public games were before they added arena. Pro’s like Tfue can easily drop into an arena game and drop 20 kills because of how diluted the player base is.

Epic please listen to the community for once. There’s going to be some really good multiplayer games coming out this Fall and lots of big streamers quitting Fortnite after World Cup. Please don’t let this beautiful game die.",FortniteCompetitive

Game companies will never learn will they, its a cycle that we need someone to break and if only I had the resources or skill to do so believe me I would. Was fun while it lasted, but my interest and what looks like a lot of other player's interest is declining and will only to continue to decline unless drastic changes are made, but we have been given no signs it will ever change and I've just accepted it and given up.

Okay, I'm going to be honest and I'm going to say MY opinion. I think that Fortnite competitive is a joke. I don't get why people want to play this game competitively. It's a battle royale, it isn't really meant to be played competitively. I guess the only competitve thing about Fortnite is who gets the victory royale. Also, I think the ""competitive"" community is very toxic. All I've seen has something to do with ""fuck Epic/Fortnite"" or ""they only care about the casuals"" and it really fucking bothers me. Fortnite was meant to be the fun casual game and rival PUBG with all its hardcore mechanics. Honestly play something else like Overwatch or R6 or some goed singleplayer/open world games like GoW or RdR2. I have 367 points in Arena but to be honest I just play it because of the health per kill. You know, I understand that you guys are frustrated with Epic and how they're ruining the game experience for you guys. You guys don't agree with most of Epic's choices but honestly I don't have a problem with what they do. For example:
Shotguns: I always find a combat no matter where I land, if I don't find one however, I don't mind the tactical shotgun. Otherwise I just use drumgun.

Burst SMG: I don't get the hate towards this gun. I actually find it really good and the fact that a blue burst can do 100 dmg is actually quite scary. Yes, I would prefer the silenced but whatever.

Ar's: Ok, every Ar is good except scoped Ar, vault it. My only problem is the Ak, I don't really get all the nerfs. And if they vaulted the hunting rifle because it was too similar to the infantry rifle you might as well vault the Ak. 

Snipers: I don't know why but I prefer the bolt instead of the silenced. It feels better I guess? Anyways, vault the semi-auto, bring back hunting, heavy sniper do whatever you want with it, I think it's okay. Competitive wise: There is no real point in using a sniper in competitive except maybe using the heavy for 1 shotting walls. I'd rather use something else to be honest.

Explosives: Rpg, grenade launcher, grenades and dynamite are okay in my opinion. I don't use explosives so can't say much but when I go against rpg/gl I just build 4head lol (sorry). Boom bow on the other hand I agree it's quite op. The thing is I never pick it up, I would rather have a sniper or something else. I think that if they just made the Boom Bow a mythic item and give it its own special arrow ammo (which would be limited, if you find a bow with like 15 arrows, that's it) it would be okay.

Consumables: Bush is just for the fun aspect, I don't care, impulses are the same, stinks are annoying but you they're like this tactical grenade you use to lure someone out of a house or something, let them stay, maybe smaller cloud or less damage but it's okay. Storm flip I just throw when I find one,I think it's fun but useless so yeah. Rift to go is great, keep it.

Vehicles: ATK and shopping cart are useless. The only problem I have now is that the desert biome has barely any vehicles. A shit ton of ATK's used to spawn there bjt not anymore so yeah. The skybases/windtunnels are just fine, people are easy to hit when they're flying in one.

Mats/shields: I really enjoyed Fortnite back when this was added so rEvErT PLeAse? I'm okay with solos right now so if they don't revert, I don't mind. Shields should increase though, I agree with you guys. Mini's should go back to being a max of 10 instead of 6. Chugjug should be more common, slurp and big shield are fine. 

If you've come this far, I'd like to share a very dumb idea I had but idk I thought it would be interesting. What if we could have attachments, for example: thermal scope for ars or silencer for smgs and ars. Not all weapons could have this though. The attachments would also change the damage of the weapon to suite it better. This means yiu can vault the scoped ar etc but still have them if you'd like to. You could only have 1 attachment per weapon at a time, idk how you would find these but it doesnt matter it was just a fun thought. Thanks for reading guys!",FortniteCompetitive

First off, how tf does a burst weapon even compare to a fully automatic weapon? The only thing they have in common is they have smg in their names. At least having the silenced being so common earlygame made not having a shotgun so bad because it was a good and accurate weapon that I often used over a tac shotgun because that's really inconsistent. I've seen some comparing the silenced to the tac AR but that's a bad comparison because it has way less dps and more hipfire bloom.


Now the combat is pretty much the only decent cqb weapon and it's rarer than the pump used to be. If a weapon has that much power it should be super common. Them removing the silenced just added a whole other layer of rng to earlygame because now you have the trash burst, tac, or a pistol if you're really unlucky instead while lucky landon gets the combat.

BRs have RNG, I get it but purposely creating more RNG that's not needed to help out casuals shouldn't be done.",FortniteCompetitive

This would be great as it would also decrease the kill percentage of the combat shogun as all weapons should have EXACTLY the same kill percentage in game. Also give the weapon the same spawn rate as the burst smg to properly balance out the game tO mAkE iT cOmPeTiTivE",FortniteCompetitive

 This was haunting me for months. Percentage shown in Loot Pool in Fortnite is practically useless because it lacks context.  If the value of spawning items overall should be 100% then why nerfs and buffs to the chances are not net zero? That means that system works differently.   
 Alltogether a better sounding message in the patch would be: Shotguns spawn 'WAY MORE OFTEN' instead of saying a percentage value which gives absolutely no idea apart from the fact that its more. There is zero transparency on how the loot pool and its generation actually works.   
 I'm aware that the GL was added but it doesn't change the fact that this implies even more changes in overall pool for every single item,not only the ones listed. No one from the players has any idea how often an actual item spawns,especially since it doesnt corelate with rarity.

Anyone who bitches about combats being rare is a bot, the gold isnprobably the best gun in the game without a doubt... think about it, I guarantee 99% of you when having a gold combat believes you can kill anyone in the game with it... believe it or not you can kill anyone in the game with just a white tac + white AR... some pros will bitch about the RNG but the best ones (clix/dubs) I can guarantee you are confident they can clap basicallt anyone with a grey tac if they have a combat... you guys should just get better aim, movement, boxfigjtig skill to actually use the skill gap that’s so massive in this game instead of bitching about RNG.

There was also no nerf to this item, and if you are really going to add a new visual for this item in v9.30 Epic you should have at least waited until v9.30 to re-release it into competitive. This item is a perfect example of why Competitive and Normal modes need separate loot pools. Competitive modes play very differently to normal modes and because of that they need a different loot pool. It’s a joke that Team Rumble has had overpowered things like the boom bow removed and the combat spawn rate buffed, but competitive is still here suffering. I promise you Epic Games, lil Timmy doesn’t care if competitive modes and casual modes have different loot pools...",FortniteCompetitive

However that nerf was useless. It’s still going to be used late game like a more op stink. It covers such a huge radius and makes things incredibly confusing along with still having the potential to take a 100 damage when everyone is already hurt. It is a bs item. 


Then the shotguns and shield increases were good (what we also asked for), except for the fact that they will barely make a difference. That is also a bigger problem when you consider that it’s an overall increase to shotgun spawns only in floor spawns and doesn’t apply to only combats. It counts tacs too.


Then let’s get onto the new proximity launcher. It is the most noob friendly thing I’ve ever seen and makes it basically free damage if the opponent even thinks they know where you are. It lasts for 10 seconds and can bounce infinitely basically putting you into in the most vulnerable position. It lets your enemy push you where if you edit to shot back, 70 health is immediately taken off. This weapon could’ve been much worse but epic is still catering to the nooby base that doesn’t even need to aim at all. 


Overall this patch was a step in the right direction BUT still has steps down for every step it takes in the right direction. It is just too hard to see the positives when there are all these negatives which affect the most dedicated players the most. That easily makes the negative atmosphere seen on this sub after the patch although epic did some good things. For example, imagine your teacher had a crazy hard class that had a decent curve system so that it wouldn’t tank any grades but over time, the curve would get even smaller for better students and even larger for the worse students (for example, a 87 gets curved to a 90 but a 63 gets curved to a 88). Then one day, the teacher comes back and says the curve will get slightly smaller for the students who get Fs but the 5 worst grades get curved to an automatic B. The people who really work hard would not be happy even though the teacher took a step in the right direction. 

TLDR: The changes that the community has been asking for have been taken into consideration and epic showed that they do every so slightly listen to the competitive community. However these changes were applied to the very minimum while still having a new, Timmy friendly item that harms the competitive game keeping the competitive community negative.",FortniteCompetitive

4) This would probably impact Epic’s revenue (maybe)
     - seeing as though this would hit the casual player base, they might stop playing, meaning they buy less skins, so Epic improves normal comp modes to keep us out of the ‘casual’ game mode

Hence the ""used to aspire to be"" but I digress. This post may be all over the place and it's things that have been said a hundred thousand times over, but I feel like my position is a little different. My K/D is 1.7 for S9, as I haven't played a lot. S8 it got to a high of 3.5 but came down to 2.73. I thought this was ""eh"" but it was okay. I'm pointing out the kd ratio just to give you an idea of what type of player I am. It's not to flex with my dinky ass numbers. Even though I wanted to go the route of being a ""pro player"" I still consider myself a normal player. I wanted to have fun at the end of the day. Anyhow, on with the post.  


Season 9 is garbage. None of the ideas from pro players are considered and the overall game isn't even fun anymore, imo. Even if I wanted to casually game, I can't. Under the new current meta, having good aim doesn't even matter anymore. The combat is somewhat nice and rewards having some aim, but the damage for a headshot is soul crushing. I can't tell you how many times I've been in a situation where my crosshair is on their head, I shoot and it does 45 crit. Stop. It's bad. The current meta doesn't award close range fights and taking risks like with the pump and spray meta.  


You're better off to pot-shot on a ramp with a combat and do more damage than a close range fight. Also, don't even get me started on the tac. Horrible. I enjoyed pump and spray more than this current sniper shotgun meta. I also don't even understand the point of the smg's anymore. I don't keep one in my inventory anymore after the 50 player mark because there's no reason to hold up space for something you can't really use effectively anymore.   


But I'm more angry about the fact that the community is not being listened to. The amount of bitching and screaming has not even made Epic think for half a second about what decisions they're making. Which in my eyes is concerning. I came from PUBG and that's how that game died. It got stale and the devs weren't listening. Look at where we are now with Fortnite. The game is stale and the devs aren't listening.   


Oh no, you cannot have an FOV slider, were also deleting stretched res too btw, fuck your motion sickness on 80 default FOV. Oh no, we wont take out the balls. Oh no, we added more bloom, have fun shooting! I could name more issues that I have, but it's just gonna be annoying for the reader.   


Is it me or is anyone else tired of what is happening to this game? This game started out as a decent product but has turned into a Frankenstein monster. The new meta is garbage, the devs wont listen to the people that play their game the most and understand the problems of the game and to top it all off, you're not allowed to customize your game experience to fit you. I don't know about you guys, but there's plenty of games to play and this one is just not for me anymore. I put probably 2000+ hours into this game and I'm officially over it. I'll come back when the devs take a second to realize that the game is being killed over trash decisions that not only effect pros, but also effect even the normals who play the game just to have fun. I don't want to pull my hair out anymore. lol",FortniteCompetitive

This is my concept for how a weekly progressive pro league could work.

Firstly I am going to list some underlying concepts which my format is based on.

*Competitive Fortnite is more suited to a 'league' format due to the large player lobbies and random aspects of the game. More games = less randomness 
*Players should be matched with mainly the same players each game. It may be impossible to get enough games in a suitable time frame if there are only 100 players in the league as to reduce randomness. Therefore I believe a league with 300 players would be good for having a higher frequency of games while also encapsulating the best of the best. 
*I think a relegation/promotion system with lower tier leagues is necessary to uphold competitive integrity for the players who are not performing well. This would produce a 'winning' mentality of players in each game and reduce the number of 'griefers'


**Format**

This will be explained in terms of solos


*300 Players total
*6 games in a 3 hour period per person. This creates 6 'Rounds' of 3 lobbies. 
*Day starts with 3 lobbies of 100 (Lobbies could be randomly generated or based of seeding). All matches start at the same time.
*Assuming people are eliminated at a similar similar rate, second round lobbies are filled in a first come first served basis
*This means the second round games will naturally fill into three groups: Lower 33, middle 33, upper 33 players of each game.
*Second round games will start when the lobbies are full. 
*You must queue in a lobby in each 'round' (You cant skip rounds)

At this point the games in the round are now staggered. I haven't done a full  analysis on the queuing system as I have exams right now, but if the maximum game time is 25 minutes the 'upper' lobbies will start on the half hour throughout the whole 3 hour session. The staggering of the time means there will be natural flow adjacently between the lobbies, as a player who does well in a middle tier lobby is likely to be bumped up into the upper tier lobby of the next round. 

There may have to be some artificial restrictions on the queuing system as to not make the time disparities between the lower ad upper lobbies too high, however we have previously seen in custom lobbies that end games are normally quite stacked so I suspect this may not be too much of an issue. 

This would create not too bad queue times (Maybe) while also having constant games after the first round making for a great viewing experience.


The 300 players should stay the same for 3 sessions (18 games total) where scores are cumulatively added, then relegation and promotion should kick in

*Bottom 50 players of 300 in Tier 1 get relegated
*Top 50 players of 300 in Tier 2 get promoted

This should create a system where people are competing to the best of their ability even to the end of the 3 sessions. 


**Scoring**

This part is the most subjective part of my idea. This is my opinion and I do not really know if this would be best for the queuing system

Placement points more thresholds and should have a greater range with thresholds at:
*Top 33
*Top 25
*Top 15
*Top 8
*Top 3
*Win

Eliminations should still be 1 point per kill.




Keep in mind that this is just a base level concept that could definitely use refinement and actual modeling of the queuing system to see if it would work. I think it could produce a really cool league style to participate in and it would work with multiple tiers per region.

The combat shoots faster, reloads quicker, and has a tighter spread. The heavy pulls out quicker after edits and it does up to 192 to the head. At that point you just need to touch them with one smg or AR bullet to finish them, and that's assuming they have a full 200 health. The weakness of the combat is it's pathetic heashot damage and slow pullout time. The weakness of the heavy is the firerate and it holds 3 less bullets

I think this would make a interesting shotgun meta. If you like to make edit plays and take the least amount of damage in a fight, the heavy would be the go-to for better players, and if you want a reassuring firerate if you whiff some shots the combat will be your go-to.

 Don't let the fact that the tac is the only competing shotgun right now fool you into thinking the combat is OP and no shotgun can compete with it. You just got used to it and losing perspective of how the other shotguns really were.",FortniteCompetitive

#General:

-Add FOV Slider, 80-95(adding this small of a FOV slider will allow for different FOVs for more comfortability without giving too much of an advantage. It should be balanced out anyways since using a bigger FOV makes character models smaller and harder to hit).

-Add 0.15 turbo build delay after swinging your pickaxe(This is to prevent low ping warriors taking your wall because they have less ping than you).

-Editing is now based on your crosshair rather than if it’s in front of you(This helps with editing pyramids greatly).

-Pre-edit option enabled

#Weapons and items:

-Increase combat spawn rate(It’s just way too low, and anyone who finds it has an advantage).

-Remove shotgun circle timer, keep it on when switching from a pump-another pump ONLY(The shotgun circle timer has been pointless as the pumps have been vaulted, it’s just hurting the combat and heavy shotgun for building and editing between shots, or even switching guns. Doing this could also GREATLY increase variety, like Epic wanted).

-Make vehicles explode by 4th circle, with a 30 second, crystal clear warning, that prevents fall damage when active(Ballers are free endgame and free points, unfair to those who actually have to use skill to get those. This will keep vehicles intended use of rotations, but get rid of their unintended use).

-Nerf heavy sniper body damage to 145/149(The heavy sniper is a bit too powerful with 150+ body damage, instantly killing someone who wasn’t lucky enough to find that big pot or slurp. Decreasing this allows for people to still take the *very* heavy damage of the Barrett, but not be instantly killed).

-Buff AK accuracy in general, and slightly reduce spawn rate(The AK is redundant after the nerfs, pretty much becoming burst 2.0. This should definetly bring it back up to par with other guns).

-Make vehicle spawn rate 100%(Getting vehicles shouldn’t be rng. The only reason they made this change was to nerf planes, but those are gone now, so...).

-Buff tac shotgun to have a slightly smaller reticle(The tac shotgun has been a very underpowered gun, and allowing this and pump/heavy-tac will hopefully make it viable again).

-Nerf stink max carry size to 3(Using 6 of these basically guaranteed an elimination with VERY little skill. This still allows for them to keep their main use of preventing turtling but not something to kill people instantly).

-Increase shield spawns however they want(with just increasing overall percent, adding cooler boxes, etc.).

-Increase grenade launcher pullout time to prevent doubling them effectively.

-Nerf Dual Wield spawn rate. They just spawn way too much.

-Nerf trap damage to 125(same reason as heavy sniper. This will still guarantee high damage but not an easy elimination).

#-Vault:

-Burst smg(Same exact reasoning for tac, except the buffs part).

-Supressed Pistol(Pistols should be in the game because it’s a BR, but that’s it. We shouldn’t need to make a buffed version of them if their purpose is to be bad).

-Boom bow(It’s just a suppressed, hitscan RPG that tells you where your shot will go. No nerf will balance it, the concept of it is just broken).

-Storm Flip(It’s just too op and broken in arena, with high player endgames).

-Supressed Bolt(The supressed bolt isn’t really fair, as snipers are supposed to be risk-reward of telling everyone your location for high damage, and the supressed has no risk).

-Green-Blue infantry rifles(These are redundant and take up better gun/item spawns, purple-gold are just way better).

#-Unvault:

-Heavy shotgun, increase pullout time slightly so double heavy isn’t OP(The heavy shotgun can be used to add variety. It would be for sacrificing higher body damage for more range, more headshot damage, faster fire rate, ability to double it, and more ammo).

-Supressed smg(This was vaulted because the burst smg was added, which no longer exists).

-P90(This can be added for variety, you can choose to have more ammo for more pressure or less ammo for higher damage).

-Bolt action sniper(To replace the supressed).

-Hunting rifle(Variety, only vaulted because the infantry rifle was apparently “too similar”, even though they weren’t similar at all other than looks).

-Green and blue pumps, change body damage to 90-95, headshot multiplier 2.0x.

#Bug fixes:

-Pretty much just fix bugs lel

#UI

-Add appear offline option again

-Make ability to see teammates kills next to their health bar

-Be able to change party options(public, private, friends)anytime. This is already possible if you go into the friends list and hit settings, so I don’t see anything wrong with making it actually available anytime with the other option.

But I really believe that the combat is insanely overpowered over the pump. 

The combat does not need a followup and it can deal considerable damage at mid range, meaning it can fill the role of a shotgun and an AR - giving you up to two extra slots in your inventory (no midrange or followup needed). It deals so much burst damage for something with its range, so it is very easy to catch someone off guard with. They have the same shots-to-kill from 150hp, but the combat will do it it less than half the time.

There are only 2 advantages to the pump, one fewer shot to kill (which actually isnt true in most cases because it is less consistent, so usually it will deal similar to combat anyway if you arent point blank), and it has a shorter equip time, making edit plays easier.

This is from the perspective of a upper-middle skill console player, if that makes any difference. lmk if you guys disagree with what i've said but for the most part I think this is how a pump/combat meta would be laid out.",FortniteCompetitive

So recently I got back into the game after a few week break and I've noticed that I haven't been able to see people through walls or just really hard to focus/track them. I don't mean like I can't find people, I mean as if I have trouble seeing where people are through wooden walls and during build fights i have problem keeping track of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought that was due to eye-strain but I realised that I was playing on a blue light filter at that time and tossed that out of the window. I then decided to turn it off and holy shit... I felt like I was a fucking eagle dude, I saw everything, I could focus on anything and just overall was popping off.

&amp;#x200B;

Come the next few days and I still have the same problem, I have problem looking for people in while gliding to my spot, looking for them after they land and just focusing on them during fights. It's like I'm just playing through my peripheral vision and that's that.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly have no clue why that is, I have this problem in overwatch also though but its not as bad. I  also noticed that I can see way more when I don't have school but I really can't do much but sleep more.

- Pump: Damage (body - 90,95) head (180, 190). This so you can't be one pumped, but can still punish and counter players that full spay you.

- Combat: It is fine if the pump is back. This allows for different types of load outs and play styles. With this gun you don't need to carry a followup weapon like the pump, but you sacrifice higher closeup damage from the pump (unless you are accurate) for longer range.

- Double barrel: Hear me out. This further allows for different load outs and play styles as it is high-risk and high reward. Edit plays don't really work for it, as you need to be in their box and in their face. This is extremely risky because you might get trap killed, but also if you miss your shots, you pretty much lose because of the high reload time.

SMGs:
- Suppressed: It has long range, and the most accuracy.

- Tactical: (Same bloom as the sub machine gun (MP5) and with only 30 bullets). Lets be honest, it is currently overpowered and so these nerfs seem appropriate for its higher DPS. Plus it looks and sounds better than the MP5.

- Compact: Your trading off higher DPS from the tactical and higher accuracy from the suppressed but you have an extra 10 bullets (40 total) to apply more pressure.

Assault rifles:
Perfectly fine, already has different play styles. (AR - spraying, Heavy AR - tap firing, Infantry - accurate and high damage, but cannot apply pressure with only 8 bullets).

Snipers:
- Heavy: Damage (body - 148,150). This makes it so the more common Epic rarity can't one shot someone with 150 health while making it more special when you pick up a Legendary one.

- Bolt: Vault the suppressed version and bring this back. No sniper should be able to shoot at players that have no idea which direction it came form.

- Hunting: This is more easy to use for quick damage at mid-range than scoped snipers and has the fastest reload time, but the trade-off is lower damage.

Explosives:
Honestly this is fine, as long as RPGs can only be found in loot crates (so no vending machines either). The Grenade launcher isn't overpowered because it sacrifices one item slot just so you can 'all-in' on one other player and actually requires skill to use. No comment on the new Proximity Launcher as we have no idea how it works until it is actually in-game, but knowing Epic it's probably going to be stupid strong.

Consumables:
Pretty good right now except for Stink Bombs. The don't have to be vaulted but can be tweaked, for example: less time they are active. Dynamite is fine because if you are willing to sacrifice a slot for the majority of a match just to throw them late-game, you deserve to because you made it that far with less items for rotations. If they have to be nerfed it would be the stack size.

Vehicles:
Everything is fine but the Baller. Vault it. Please.",FortniteCompetitive

So here’s how you can guarantee yourself a Combat Shotgun. First of all you have to land at a hot drop.  The first thing you want to do is land on a loot crate at the hot drop. When you break it you have a like %30 change of getting a Combat. If you don’t get one break as many loot crates as you can. Doing this will guarantee you a Combat. I’ve been trying this in a lot of arena games and it works and I can make it to endgame. You can also have more of the loot to yourself if the hot drop is far from the bus. For example I landed at haunted hills with 4 players while it was a hot drop. I landed on a loot crate, broke it and it dropped an ar, so I broke another nearby loot crate and it dropped a gold Combat. I eliminated 3 of the 4 players and all of them had Combat shotguns. This strat practically guarantees a Combat Shotgun!",FortniteCompetitive

The tac deals no damage at any range other than when the barrel is in your opponents mouth and even then it’s 50/50. The reason people don’t like going so close to others which you have to do with a tac is that it’s so unreliable and buggy so your opponent has a chance so it’s just like why would you bother? Using the tac puts you in unnecessary danger, the combat and the pump do/did not, they reward good building and spacing, the tac does not nearly as much.

While this is unfortunate, there's nothing Epic can do since there isn't always enough players to fill up a match, would it be fair to let Jarvis queue with 40 people? No.

Also when there are only 30 minutes left people tend to play w-key games to play all their matches until the last queue.

I can't think of any other way to solve this than having X amount of set games that ALL people play. Yes, every 30 minutes there's a queue that splits all the players in even lobbies as close to 100 players per lobby as possible.

Pros:
- This would prevent w-keying and actually reward consistency.
- It would eliminate unfortunately long queues
- It would not punish people who place well in matches (in current format people who win/get 2nds and 3rds can't play all their games)

Cons:
- Longer tournament or fewer matches than the current 10. With 10 matches, the tournament would last 5+hours (30 x 10 / 60 + queue times)
- More waiting inbetween matches if you die early

Every gun has an advantage amd disadvantage. Then epic removed the pump and replaced it with the combat shotgun. Guess what all the competitive community started complaining because the damagw wasnt as good as the pump and there is still pull out delay. But guess what this guns advantage is its semi automatic literally you domt have to wait to fire the next shot and also you can shoot people so far away, the disadvantage the damage isnt good as the pump. What do you guys want is a pump shotgun that does a huge amount of damage without pull out delay. Where is the disadvantage in that?

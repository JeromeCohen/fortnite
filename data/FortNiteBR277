This is baring in mind that I play on PS4 so it is slightly harder to do double shotgun, however I have never had a problem with this. 

I just wanted to see what other people think as I feel that both strategies are good but that the smg buff has made Shotgun + SMG better. ",FortNiteBR

Imo. this is so childish from the developers to specifficly not invite them as they are one of the most if not the most known Fortnite competetive teams out there, and has some of the best players in the game. EPIC hasn't even told the members of Faze why they are not invited to the turnaments. This reminds me of elementary school where you would let people play only because you don't like them. Fortnite is a competetive community game that should involve the best players even though the developers don't neccecary like them.

It just doesn't make any sense to not invite them, they are some of the best players in the game. Tfue and Cloak are the duos who have won the most out of anyone. Tfue is the 2nd most watched Fortnite streamer after Ninja, Lately he has been pulling 50-70k+ viewers almost every stream. Still they invite people like OneShotGurl(No hate against her, she is one of the nicest people in this community) who isn't anywhere close to the best players and isn't pulling nearly as many viewers as the Faze boys.

I know I'll get hate for supporting Faze and all the TSM fanboys are gonna downvote this cause they are nowhere near grown up, but still, if this happend to the TSM boys that would as fucked up and shouldn't happend to any of the biggest teams.",FortNiteBR

It seems like although the pump is still a good gun when hits properly register, more shots hit damage of 8 or 16 then the 80's or 100+. A possible solution to this would be a minimum damage counter, opposite to the damage drop off this would provide a fixed minimum damage at the bottom of the target such as 40 damage to the toes and legs and increases the closer the shot reaches the head. This would fix the inconsistency without being overpowered. Another solution would just simply to be to remove the slow pump switch animation as pumps have been nerfed and are no longer a competitor to the tactical and heavy, this removes variety of play style and makes the game feel stale compared to what it used to be. The third and final solution would be to increase the value of the shot depending how close it lands to the centre dot of the article and how much of the target is in the reticle. Please upvote if you think these are also viable ways to fix the pump",FortNiteBR

Atari, Nintendo, Xbox, Playstation, Sega, mobile, PC, the arcade (90's kids never even heard of an arcade). Played thousands of  games from hundreds of Developers. There have been good Devs, and bad Devs (we know who they are now) But EPIC not only made a game that is amazing and fun to play, but they really try their best to listen to us and adjust their game for US, the fans and people playing the game, very few Dev's have done this, even the good ones.  
They try their damnedest to balance the game, fix bugs, which isn't easy, but I think they've doing an amazing job, with work to do on that end.  So cut them some slack, we could have had another Dev team not quite so caring in charge of this game.

Point being, in all my years of gaming, I've never had a game hook me so fast (started back in Sept/October sometime) and kept me hooked, engaged for so long. I'm HYPED for this upcoming Season.

i will warn you, my english is terrible but my frustration has lead me to make this post.

Shotguns... They deal way to less damage and lost their meaning. I don't think you should deal 200+ damage with a Shotgun, that's absurd. If you got one-pumped you lost the game because you maybe didn't play attention for 1 second.

Of course you should get punished if you don't pay attention, that's the point of a Battle Royale Game, but dying from a Shotgun in 1 hit with 200hp just doesn't feel right. But i also think that a Shotguns should do atleast 140 damage, if i ever manage to hit someone from 3 feet away. Nowadays pumping people in the Head deals 80-100 damage, which is very useless especially in the late game where people have all sorts of guns, if you hit them once they just shoot you with an MP5 which does way more damage in way faster time.  Taking shotguns at the moment is a waste unless you have a Heavy Shotgun or maybe a Green/Blue Tactial Pump, all other shotguns are trash and just take too much space of your inventory, especially double pump.

C4, Rocket Launcher and most important Granade Launcher deal way do much radius Damage on Buildings....

I really cheered for Epic Games when they nerfed the amount of Rockets you could carry, but why in the hell did they buff the radius of explosions by 2-4 times?! It completly ruins the Building side of this game (which is one of the most important parts of the game if not the most important). It's annoying/op at any stage of the game, early-, mid-, lategame, doens't matter. Rockets will either oneshot you because you didn't have enough Health or Recources to protect yourself, or when Lategame arrives and you have enough Recources, people with Rockets will just spam at you until your Fort breaks down over and over again and most of the time if one of the rockets hits the player, you'll drop down to 50hp if you had 200HP or you literally just die because it too much damage so you could even survive the damn thing!.

Yes, i only mentioned 2 points here that annoy me, but these thing i encounter pretty much every game atleast once if not 3-4 times, which doens't make the game fun for me personally. The Game now with the material nerfs is just slower than it used to be and the really fast paced shotgun meta was what drove me to start this game everyday with my buddies and play but sadly these times have passed and they only one who can bring those times back....is EPIC GAMES.

This is my first Reddit post so i apologize for any mistake i made here.

Thanks for reading, please post below to let me know your thoughts on the current state of the Game and what needs to be fixed.",FortNiteBR

I own the battle pass on ps4 ( I am tier 100 lvl 71), but when Fortnite came out on the switch a few weeks ago I used it as an opportunity to play with my xbox friends.  We grinded about 100 games with a 40&amp;#37; win percentage (shoutout Switch noobs) and I had to play all those games without any of the skins I had previously bought ,while my xbox friends got to use all their skins, just because Sony thinks that they are leaders of the industry and don't want to allow cross play.

Since I spent the past couple weeks playing on the Switch I was unable to reach lvl 80 on my ps4 battle pass, which I believe I would have been able to reach if I was able to link my account.

The point of a video game is to HAVE FUN, and that's exactly what I did by choosing to play on Switch with my xbox friends.  I am not whatsoever upset about that choice either, I'm glad I have a platform to be able to play with them.  However, I would have much rather been playing on a higher fps like my ps4 (if you've played on Switch and then onto a console/pc before you know how brutal this difference is) but I chose to do the thing that let me have the most fun with my FRIENDS.  I had to sacrifice my battle pass reward and the flow of gameplay when I made this choice.

The point here is that I should NOT have to make this choice in that I have to sacrifice things that I paid for while I play the SAME game on a separate account just to have the most fun.  Sony is restricting me and I just do not believe that is right.  I haven't seen much about them in awhile so I hope people have not forgotten as I know that many people are in a similar boat to this bullshit situation.",FortNiteBR

Then we had an idea.

Plebs have always been pulling out wins when the odds were against them. Hiding in bushes and huts, avoiding battles so they would not die. Knowing that if they could survive till the end, they would only have to win one battle.

Me and my friends changed to pleb skins and tried to blend in. We waited till the bus kicked us out and then deployed our parachutes and waited for the circle to appear and then fly to the most remote area in the circle and loot up.

Once we were looted we played the game of plebs. Bush to bush, hut to hut. We hide from the battles, survival in mind. Then we battle at the end and use our pretty good building skills and hope we win the one battle that counts.

With this strategy, we won 4 games in a row yesterday. Bringing my squad win total to 9 in 112 games (I switched to Xbox from PS4 recently to play with close friends, reason for the low game count).

Long story short, default skins have been showing us the key to victory for so long. I admire their gorilla warfare styles, fucking bush camping, hunting and gathering savages.

A few days ago, I logged onto my fortnite account on my PS4 to find that my account had skins that were refunded and and random purchases were made. At first I was confused because I wouldn't of returned the detective skin I bought.

 So I talked with my friends and they said to check my fortnite account that is linked to PC. Upon logging into my PC linked account I found that all my settings were changed, and I had random friends on my friends list. When looking further into the settings of my account, I found that the server was set to EU, which I am a US player. So at that point I found that my account had been compromised. 

I immediately started to go on a password reset spree. I reset my email, my epic games and my backup email. I also looked through my email in the trash and in the spam. Nothing indicated that someone logged into my account. So I also set up that two step authentication which I didn't know was a thing as I am primarily a PS4 player and typically games don't have additional authentication needed since my PS account does that for me. 

After the typical compromised account freakout, I turned to Epic to see if they could roll back my account. After explaining what I explained to you above this was my response:

To You

&gt;Hello there,
Thank you for contacting Epic Games Player Support. I apologize for the delay in my response.
&gt;I am sorry to hear that someone used your return tickets on your account without your permission. Any cosmetic items that have been returned using the self-return tool may not be reversed. If you are interested in repurchasing the item we recommend keeping an eye on the store as it updates each day at midnight UTC.
&gt;In addition, Epic Games Player Support is unable to reverse previous cosmetic returns or add additional returns upon request.
&gt;Thank you for understanding and I apologize we are unable to further assist in restoring the item(s) returned.
If you have any other issues in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact us again.
Kind regards,

While waiting for this response, I a dug around and found things about the leaking of fortnite credentials, if they're true or not, I don't know. But the timing of everything is odd to say the least. The person that had my account has tried changing my password a few times since I got it back. I wish there was a forced loggout available.

What do you guys think? I'd love to hear your opinions or experiences. I doubt I'm the only one affected.

I will not be purchasing any more skins or products from epicgames unless the service is improved. My trust in this company is gone at the moment.

three years ago, when i first started using reddit, the main sub i visited was (bear with me) /r/fivenightsatfreddys. the community was great and there was lots of creativity and ideas being shared. but if i remember correctly, with the popularity of the game rising, and the age demographic gradually lowering, the overall quality of the subreddit started to decrease.


eventually, the quality of the community was becoming so toxic that things would be downvoted to oblivion if they stepped out of line of the community's mass opinions, and important things were being hidden from the view of most because of useless reasons. for example, i remember there were so many... uh... ~~bad~~ improvable drawings and 3d models being shared, and all of the top comments were ""whoa great job this is perfect and awesome!"" and anyone saying something like ""this is really cool.. but also the head is a little bit too big"" would be sent straight to the bottom of the comment section, never to be considered by that artist.


when any community gets like this, it's time to start evolving to better suit the individuals in it. we *all* see it happening, we've all seen a comment get needlessly downvoted, but we usually just stand by and watch as it happens. it's time we took a look at the big picture, what's happening to the quality of our subreddit, and make changes. we need a voice for both ourselves and each other, but we can't rely on the second one too much.


disabling downvotes through CSS can't prevent people bypassing it just to downvote, though, and i'm aware, but it'd decrease the chances of these things happening tenfold.

The Season 4 Farewell Ceremony:

Drop Location: Risky Reels, to reminisce the day of chaos that was the Risky Reels chest challenge. 

Skin/Outfit: *Any* and *every* Season 4 Battle Pass skin in order to symbolize Season 4 &amp; everything it stands for. But don’t just run the Omega, we’re gonna need some variety so that we can get a full Season 4 vibe!

Time/Server/Date: Wednesday July 11, Oceania Solos, queue up at *exactly* 4PM Pacific Time. This event will happen only once, let’s make it count.

**Objectives**

Emote: I’d say we can all agree that the emote symbol of this season is the Orange Justice, use that emote to signify our unity. If you don’t have it, no big deal. But if you do, make sure you use it! Use this emote in the middle of Risky Reels.

Sprays: Make three walls &amp; mark them with three of your favorite sprays, just to further emphasize the Season 4 vibe

Rules: Absolutely *no* shooting. I know there’s always that one kid who has no life and ruins it for the rest of us, but for the most part, we’re all pretty chill. 

And as always, this will all be streamed on my [Twitch Channel](https://m.twitch.tv/sqoof/profile) &amp; make sure you join the Discord in my [Twitter Bio](https://twitter.com/xsqoof?lang=en) so we can chill &amp; socialize during &amp; after the event.

I mostly play squads and duos and got to level 94 this season with 155 wins. I dont call myself good at this game, just decent, and I must say level 80 was not hard at all.  And I can even say they should keep level 80 or higher the cap for this kind of cosmetic rewards. Why?

It should be an achievement, it should impose fear in your enemies. Now after reading so many comments I know, many light Omegas just got it by hiding in a bush while doing other stuff.

Its fun when you play to increase your kd and win rate, gives your a purpose besides the Omega lights and you actually improve your game. 

TLDR;
They should keep level 80 for special cosmetics or make the goal even harder. ",FortNiteBR

I'm now at 600 vbucks ( https://i.imgur.com/wXGaKZ3.png ) and after season 5 I will be standing at 800 vbucks, 150 short for battle pass. This 150 is more important than you might actually think first. You are rewarded 100 vbucks twice during the free track of battle pass and in current state, I need to hit both before being able to claim my first battle pass. It happens to be, that the second batch of vbucks is so late in the free track that it would not be in my favour to buy battle pass in Season 6 now, as I'd run out of days to grind vbucks back.

But, if Epic could reward 50 more vbucks during the Season 5 free track, I'd be able to buy battle pass during Season 6 more easily and get into big boys league.

190,safe_badger,1531321546,8y0ck7,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8y0ck7/dont_hate_shoutout_to_the_good_people/,12,Don't hate - Shout-out to the good people,"I got into Fortnite because friends started playing and I caved to peer pressure. I have enjoyed the game, bought the season 4 battle pass, and pushed myself to complete the grind to level 80. During all this time I spent a lot of time alone which is when I like doing squad fills with randoms. 

I want to say two things to help me vent a bit (don't need upvotes, just a small soapbox):

1. The Fortnite gaming community is not spoken of highly from what I have seen. I suppose anything massively popular will get some backlash but this is not a fair assessment of our community. I have played 1100+ games and only had one experience of hate from a team I joined. Thank-you to all those who help make the game fun. I have joined squads of young kids and had a blast as they talk non-stop about inane things, played alongside people who don't speak my language, laughed at people who leave their microphone on and are listening to music or watching TV. I just laugh the entire time. 

2. Don't hate - I had some downtime yesterday and squad filled as a solo. I marked a location and my team dropped in a different spot (I was playing on my phone and missed their marker). I goofed so I took the long glide to them. Landed with one person who had a racist user name. It was something close to the n word but I did not know what it meant until looking it up after. (urban dictionary for the win) I landed with my teammate and was berated for having Omega (""Looks like someone bought all his battlepass levels""), which I thought was funny. But then he followed me around the map calling me racist names, and homophobic names. I figured if I ran to the other teammates he would stop and or at least I could just game with them. I was wrong. They all proceeded to build me into boxes and follow me around (I muted the only talker but I assume the hate was flowing). It completely ruined my experience. I should have just left but I wanted to get some kills and I guess prove them wrong. This experience of online bullying really shook me and it has been 24 hours but I still replay the level of hate in my head over and over. I wanted to post here today to say DON'T HATE! I love this game, most of the community, and I ask that you please don't be these people.

Also I saved a recording of the game with the hateful names. I reported them to Epic along with the recording. Epic responded saying they take this stuff serious and will look into the matter. I hope that the hate is removed from this great game. It bothered me but I will get over it (this post will end it for me). I hope they are banned before they do something that hateful to someone young who is not equipped to cope.

To the people whose squads I have joined, been welcomed into, and had a pile of fun surviving.... thank-you. You rock and make this game worthwhile.

This incident has bothered me and is stuck on my mind on repeat. I have never experienced such hate online so I needed to vent somewhere, I hope this is the right spot for such things.",FortNiteBR

Then,it will appear back in-game in the H9 square ( the only square left from the spectographs where nothing appeared) and thus will bring the sand (desert biome) with it as the crack in the sky will get very big and create the new fornite map for season 5

I see players being divided between ""skins"" and ""no skins"", and when looking for group, people set requirements like ""having max level Battle Pass"", which can be identified by the max level skin rewards people get.

I know skill doesn't depend on that, but seeing someone with a max level Pass reward sure is a sign of some skill in the game, since it's supposed that person has played a lot to achieve that, thus accumulating game experience.

To avoid having ""no skins"" excluded by the community, I'd like to suggest a simple skin variation for the middle and max normal pass levels. The male/female auto variation could continue, but with somewhat improved skins, that could be used to diferentiate such players from beginner ones.

This also serves like a progression reward itself. Apart from gaining experience, playing without more rewards is just frustrating as it feels the game is only inclined towards those who use vbucks.

I also know this game needs people to put money into it, but imo keeping it more f2p friendly is a win-win situation, since a player that is around for so long may someday feel like spending some money in it.

&amp;nbsp;

Season 4 was a very difficult time for in my life. I managed to start Week 1 and complete all my challenges, and looked forward to the rest. As Week 2 began, my life began to spiral downwards as my household was hit by problem after problem. Identity fraud, bank account breaches, false debts being requested from collections, emotional instability, health deteriorating. It all lasted for so long, it was Week 7 by the time things were balanced again, and I could finally get into the rhythm of my life. There's still taints of it left, but we're playing through it.

&amp;nbsp;

However, through all this, Fortnite was able to help. There was a calming feelings, letting out all my anger and frustration at Tilted Towers. The adrenaline of completing all my challenges from weeks 2-7 to receive The Visitor skin. The grind to Tier 100, and then level 80 (which unfortunately I couldn't get to, I'm at 73). It was all so exhilarating for me, in a time were life felt really empty. Little by little, I started meeting online friends by just joining other friends' lobbies, and so forth. We had jokes and sometimes didn't even care about winning, but just having fun which made the laughs so much sweeter. Now, I'm meeting a few of those online friends all at once this Saturday at a BBQ. 

&amp;nbsp;

Epic, this may just be one of the few little stories that Fortnite helped someone through a difficult time, but I personally want to express my genuine thanks for providing an escape in a time where it was needed and bringing me closer to friends whom I'd never have had the chance to meet irl otherwise.

**I was killed by:**

54&amp;#37; Shotgun

30&amp;#37; AR

4&amp;#37; Storm

4&amp;#37; Snipe

2&amp;#37; Grenade Launcher 

2&amp;#37; Fall Damage

1&amp;#37; Rockets

1&amp;#37; SMG

1&amp;#37; LMG

1&amp;#37; Minigun

Conclusions: I found retail to be a very fair, and a fun place to land. Tilted was just a nightmare of RNG, but Retail gave me a chance most times to get down and fight. My wins were a bit low but all the other data seemed to line up right between Tilted and Moisty which is what many of you suggested.

Whats next? 

I'm going to wait for Season 5 map changes to be revealed before I pick a new spot. I also just switched to Builder Pro(finally!) so I'm going to adjust to that for a bit.

* Every time Epic changed something that made the game unbalanced, they quickly reverted it. It's not in their interest to ruin the game, so no need to worry, they've probably already abandonned their mat nerf ideas after reading the feedback.

Come this friday me and a friend found out it was 100&amp;#37; possible by cheesing it and A LOT of play time. I thought I would be spending the entire rest of the season to achieve this but acctually I finished one day early and also could some what ""slack"" off monday/tuesday.  


We started playing when we got home from work friday evening. We played basically the whole friday and into saturday at around 5 in the morning. Slept, woke up and continued the whole saturday untill basically the same time and then continued on sunday.  


On saturday I started tracking the games to see how we did. [Here is a link to said spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cVro55eUuZMkSkta-qw-c32McFu2_-inDFlfZpK1UFc/edit#gid=0). Since I didnt start tracking before Saturday I dont have the exact amount of games but my guesstimate is that I played about 170 games to achieve this. 170 games at an average 20 minute games mean 65-70 hours of fortnite (not including queing and lobby). I am so tired of fortnite that when I close mye eyes at night to sleep I can hear the headshot \*KLINK\* in my head. Since I personally never where one of the afk people (beside from when I afked while at work). I am still hyped to play again for new season tomorrow though!   


Our tactic:  
Our tactic was to always reach top 10 people alive (not team placement) to get maximum amount of exp. We setup laptops with everyones account rotating when people could not play them self to just be afk for the increased exp bonus.  We let the bus throw us out at the last possible place and then deployed the glider untill we could see where the ring would be and then landed somehwere ""not interesting"" to get some loot. Doing this we did surprisingly ok with sometimes just being two people in squad games, winning a few games here and there. When we reached top 10 we tried to win the games even though maximum exp its better to just die, we did this to not go insane. When we tried to win we just waited for the last two squad to fight eachother and then try to pick off the winning team before they could heal.  


The AFK guys where placed in the middle of the map in a bush. When the circle moved we would try to auto run them to hide somewhere so the AFK people also would get decent exp. We also sometimes used them to scout out areas for us so we would know where we could run without dying. We called them ""scout drones"" This made me want to have an drone like item that you can deploy to scout out an area and maybe pick up one piece of loot or something or you. Especially since one game we used one of the AFKS to go fetch us loot from dead people in tomato town while we where sitting inside the tunnel. Also my brother bought battlepass one week before this and did all the challenges and he also joined this grind. His battlepass is now 100 (only bought the 10 tier deal) and is almost level 65.   


My conclusion:  
I WILL NEVER DO THIS AGAIN. We just did this because we noticed it was possible and we wanted to try but once is enough because this grind was HUGE. I think the exp system is stupid since it is rewarding too much passive play and getting top 10. Kills should be more valuable for exp.   


Some memorable moments: WARNING: I suck at editing(and fortnite) so these are not very good ;))  
1. We died while one of our afk guys where stranded in the middle of dusty. I quickly changed to the laptop and got a triple kill with touch pad

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLIEOeMy9Sg)  


2.  Getting out of a really messy build fight against another team to then win the game with a really cool ending (my editing probably ruins this)  
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag-R8sXx4B4)  


3. My last game before 80. Just placing top 10 won't make me level up. I have to go so I auto run in to the circle just to get die so I get the exp. When I leave I forget my car keys so I return to my room just to see that I ran straight past someone and then this happens: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uD96dblTAAY). Since I got the kill I got just enough exp to level up to 80 :D

**TLDR;** Wanting to see if I could reach 80 and played way to much fortnite so now I hear the headshot sound \*KLINK\* when I close my eyes irl.

        Then as I went on to my third game, it was alright the first 5 minutes but, then my phone began to heat up. As I continued, my phone got hotter and hotter. Confused, I checked if any apps were open and none of them were except Fortnite. As I got to the end of the game, my phone was so hot that my phone would freeze for 3-5 seconds then go back to having horrible frames!

I find it hard to believe the majority of people find this tactic to be fun to play with. Literally find myself dying to SMG and explodes spams in duos/squads more than anything else. It’s just not enjoyable to me, this meta has sucked the fun out of the game completely. In between getting C4ed, melted with an SMG/Tommy Gun, and having my buildings be completely wrecked by a combination of all of those guns, how is it even fun for a lot of you? It’s gotten to a point where I can’t even run a loadout that I enjoy, I have to use what everyone else is using so I can cheese my way to a victory royale. Today I just got tired of getting melted by cheese weapons so I carried nothing but a Tommy Gun, Tac SMG, and a RPG. I guess everyone else felt the same too, because that’s what every guy is using in the game now. 

I could understand if it was counterable in duos and squads, but it’s just is not. Today in duos I decided to try and build my way out of most of these encounters and as soon as my wall goes up, it’s already down. There was one time when I managed to get onto my ramp but it was immediately shot down while someone was pushing from on top of me. Pretty much got melted from that point by a Tommy Gun. The best part is that when you’re at 75 HP, you don’t even have the reaction time if someone hits you with headshots. I get that a lot of people wanted “anti build weapons” but holy shit, not only did Epic buff the existing explodes, they gave us an entire loadout to ruin complex builds with. I’m not saying to nerf the current weapons so please don’t just downvote and not say anything, i would like to genuinely know who here actually enjoys this meta.",FortNiteBR

So my laptop just had one of its fans start rattling and I have been forced to switch to the PlayStation 4 to continue grinding towards the end of Season 4 and unlock full Omega (Level 78 half way through. Fingers crossed). I've tried to use the same settings to using the Mouse and Keyboard on the PS and I've been having a hard time controlling my character and the aiming of the pickaxe/guns.

On my PC I use a DPI of 1200, PC Mouse sensitivity on about a little higher than medium and the in-game X and Y mouse to 0.11 each. The Mouse ADS is 0.6\~ and Mouse Scope ADS is 0.75.

Is there in any way I could get to the same feel using a mouse and keyboard that I get on the PC to the PS? I up and die in the first 2 minutes of the game using the same setup as my PC or even using the controller (I'm more of a noob when it comes to shooters on a controller) so the XP i get is really bad.

Even defaults are doing it. Even when the pump was nurfed (which is another negative thing) it still works half the time. Mini guns are the same story. If two or more people are shooting you with a mini gun the is little to nothing you can to. You cant build fast enough to defend yourself and if you peak you will get lasered with it.

I think this is a really good way to keep cheaters away however, buying a new pc just to play again is expensive. Having a second chance to play on the game is a great idea while keeping the account that you cheated on ban. This way with a second chance you can keep in mind that you wont be able to play this game at all on that pc. ",FortNiteBR

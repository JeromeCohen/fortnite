Thirsting is one of the most unfun mechanics in this game next to bullet bloom.

When people play with friends, that’s what People want. To play with friends. Not spend the next 10/15 minutes spectating or having friends spectate, and 90% of the time or more if you get downed in squads (in duos as well but not as frequently) you get immediately thirsted. If it’s early in the game and let’s say you win that fight, one or more of your friends still aren’t playing with you, which is what is wanted. The desire to back out is stronger than to to continue playing at a major disadvantage.

Is it cool when you pull off a win with teammates? Sure. But it isn’t good as winning with everyone standing.

Bleed out should still happen because if you can’t resolve that fight in that time or get them up, that’s the teams issue and not the enemy players impulsively thirst just because they know it creates an unfun game experience for others they have to go through themselves frequently.",FortNiteBR

•go onto reddit to write a so called heart warming story about your sons first victory while trying to fix your dysfunctional marriage.

So...you would think that I've improved a good deal and I'm getting more kills and wins, right? Well...no. That's actually VERY wrong. I don't know what the actual hell it is, but I have never gotten a solo win, and I've never gotten more than 5 kills. Yet, I feel sooooo much more comfortable with the game than I did 5 months ago when I started. Like, I was your typical noob who used the touchpad on a laptop instead of a normal mouse getting 0 kills per game and not even being able to build. With time I started getting very few kills and I bought an actual gaming mouse cuz I was pretty invested. I started watching streamers all the time and practiced in-game all the time, and I'm just not seeing the results. I know how to build, I aim much better, but there's some fundamental aspect missing from my gameplay that I'm just not realizing. I've watched tons of my replays to try to fix my mistakes and it's worked but only to a certain degree. I swear I feel like I've hit rock bottom in this game cuz I just can't seem to get better for the life of me. If you look at my stats, they're really low, but that's because I've played so many matches where I've gotten very few kills and no wins, but within this past month, I feel like I've improved a lot, which don't get me wrong, I have because I am starting to kill more skilled players, but it's just baffling how I haven't won at least once.

I do use clickbait-ish titles which i kinda wanna move pass cause I'm disgusted with myself at this point with them.  I have trouble creatively with thumbnails and as for the gameplay I do minor edits here and there. I try to have fun with sound effects and memes however I know some people just find them distracting and annoying. 

Obviously there is a dedicated playerbase on this sub and I'm not here trying to advertise the channel so I won't plug it unless asked too. I want to just find out what you would like to see content-wise.

These are the major problems that NEED to be fixed soon:

• At the beginning of matches, there is currently a very high chance of nothing rendering for a good minute or two, even when you’re right on top of it. You’re just bouncing up and down. This also happens constantly mid match for whatever reason .

• Not only are buildings not rendering in, but player models aren’t either. MID MATCH there’s invisible players with the only visible thing being their weapons. Incredibly frustrating.

• Constant frame drops, including stuttering and complete freezing, especially after knocking or eliminating an opponent.

• Emoting sometimes freezes your character. You can’t build, shoot or get off a vehicle if you’re on one until you eventually get the animation to play.

• Sometimes you get stuck in ADS without pressing the trigger, pressing it again will take you out of ADS. This happens with shooting sometimes as well.

• Riding a cart into an unrendered area will drop you under the map. As long as you stay on the vehicle you’ll live.

• Turbo building is broken. Sometimes structures won’t be placed no matter how long you’re holding down the trigger

Xbox is in need of a major stability and optimization update. I should be worried about finding good weapons at the start of matches, not whether or not the buildings will be rendered in by the time I land.

I pretty much play or try to play every night because I thoroughly enjoy this game. To be honest, I haven’t liked a game quite like this since I was introduced to COD 10 years ago - but I am starting to find myself becoming less tolerant of fortnite as of the last few patches AKA sub machine gun/ tommygun “meta” and wood becoming glass so to speak. Anything with that much RPM shouldn’t shred wood like it does. The game is in its most random state it’s ever been in IMO and it’s becoming less fun in the sense that fortnite’s foundation is BUILDING and in this current state, building is almost useless.


Let me get to the point of this discussion..
I believe there are a few ways to fix this issue

1. Revert changes to wood and tommygun damage to structure gets nerfed
2. Make brick and steel have more health when set and when in full health

I get it, epic wants to prioritize wood in a lesser category, hell, before these patches I barely used metal or brick for anything. 

Oh and PS I’m not a double pump guy but with the current spray and pray BS, I wouldn’t be opposed to the DP coming back to combat so many people using high RPM guns.  The explosives need a nerf back to its original state but the nerf to ammo can stay IMO.

Thoughts?

I personally would like to see them redo the system for BR. Id like something like increased building time but you cant say walk on top of stairs until they are completely finished building so instead of every fight being ""who can build a taller tower quicker"" it becomes ""who can pull back and build a stronger base first"".

This will fix a few problems with the meta right now. First, I think if they do something like restore dusty or add a new flat terrain area to the map along with another long range game mode it will encourage this new more strategic playstyle and pull players away from tilted making mid game fights more common as 50 people dont die before the first circle. This will also in a way nerf sub machine guns which as of right now are extremely over powered. 

I think it could make for a lot of cool moments in squad mode where instead of the whole squad building towers, some of them fall back to build a defensible base while the other put down heavy fire on the enemy base to slow them down. Charges will be a lot more risky as you cant just build up to them and pull out a pump, you instead need to take down their base to get to them. Things like the new rifts and jump pads will be necessary to close the distance on an enemy rather than something you use to get onto a tower or out of the storm.

I just think they should take a page from save the world and make building more about who can build better rather than who can build quicker. Itll shake up the game and change the 5 season long meta. Fortnites ""build a tower and pump the other guy"" gameplay is getting old and after a year now I think they're going to need to do something big with all these new competitors coming along and people complaining about the new mechanics recently.

 Recently however, If we get run up on and they all die quickly, I try to build myself into a position to fight the other squad members and just get exploded down constantly, unable to even put up a couple walls + ramp before just immediately being knocked down again. 

What's the point of building up or even playing anything other than passive anymore?

He promptly dies and I'm left to 3v1. 

Something triggers in me. I grab his jetpack and RL and start aerialing the shit outta the enemy players - predicting where they're going to land, getting double kills from teammates trying to revive each other. I'm usually terrible at Fortnite, I've never even got close to 1st place in any of the gamemodes I've played except for 50v50 I guess. But years of practicing soldier on Cp_Orange suddenly awakened and I was destroying players left and right. 

People ragequit. Children cheered. My teammates were genuinely blown away by my mediocre accuracy and dodging skills. Every kill I got they would cheer, and every time I got hit they would enthusiastically exclaim ""HOW DID THAT HIT YOU???""

But I felt like a goddamned hero. And the next round they stuck to me like middle schoolers to free V-bucks scams. 

Sometimes playing Fortnite with little kids can reinfuse the excitement and joy of playing the game. Sure they're screechy, easily excitable, and their sense of humor is literally an 8 years old's, but I swear they are some of the most wholesome and supportive members of the Fortnite community.

Smgs, dual pistols, tommy guns, all seem to melt very very very fast.

It feels like gun fights don’t last near as long because several guns now can reliably kill you in under 1-2 seconds.

I know ARs could too, but not near as consistently.

It’s kind of making the game worse to me, now you can be instamelted just like that. And it kind of feels cheap. It feels like CoD ttk, which isn’t good in a game like this.

In CoD there is respawning, or at most short breaks between a spawns (snd, ctf, etc) so dying fast isn’t as big a deal.

But in a game like this where you can insta die by smg in 1 second after spending 10 minutes prepping and gathering, it kind of makes you just want to play CoD instead, at least in CoD there isn’t bloom.

August 1st is a whole month from their initial release, more than enough time for them to show up again.

In my experience, a day with just one featured skin usually ends up being followed by one featuring multiple.  I.e. moisture merman and Wukong recently coming after the release of suntan specialist.

We may be seeing some of the rarer (and in my opinion, cooler) skins of season 4 return soon.  The rest of the set isn’t too bad either.  Now I just need to decide between Gumshoe or Noir...

I’ve spent well over $1000 on this game and STW and i feel like I’m being hugely screwed over.  I need this to get the attention of an epic employee because i feel like I’m banging my head against a brick wall trying to get anything through proper channels. 

Friday afternoon, mid playground session on my Xbox, i was kicked from the game. The initial message i received was ‘account logged in elsewhere’. I tried to sign back in a few times and wasn’t able to. Tried to log in on the epic website only to receive the message ‘account inactive, unable to log in’.

I’ve followed the proper channels and emailed epic customer support and the only response i have personally had is automatically generated replies telling me to reset my password (this does not work). My partner also emailed customer support just to try and cover as many bases as possible. Today she received a response that my account has been permanently banned for ‘cheating’.  We replied to this with a request for further info and all we got back was another auto-generated response about how bans won’t be overturned. 

I have a few issues with this. One, being the obvious one, is that i have never cheated or abused any bugs that may have given me a competitive advantage over anyone in fortnite or any game I’ve ever played. You might not believe this and all the sob stories that have turned out not to be true in the past may leave you cautious but i implore epic to put me on blast and tell everyone what i did if they see this. I’m genuinely intrigued. 

Secondly, why on Earth are they responding to someone regarding my account who’s email address has clearly never been linked to it. With no effort to ascertain any credentials to prove it’s my account. 

With regards to the accusation of cheating, the only possible time this could have happened is when my account was compromised around 4 weeks ago - an issue that i both contacted epic about (and still haven’t received a response) and posted on here about but i feel that one simple look at my ip records would have cleared that up and i just don’t believe that there isn’t some protection in place for instances such as this. 

I’m at a loss with what to do, praying to the reddit gods that this takes off and i get some answers.

I was one of these people until very recently when I built my first gaming pc. However, many of my friends still play on low end hardware and their game is very laggy. Some of my friends had decided to stop playing on their laptops and instead play on their phones just because of how unbearable the performance was.

This gave me an idea. When Epic made fortnite on mobile, they made heavy graphical compromises to make sure the game would run smoothly on mobile hardware. Can Epic give people the option to lower their settings down to mobile level so that they could get a boost in fps. I'm pretty sure theres no competitive  advantage that people can gain by doing this.

Not only could this help out my friends and other low end pc players, it could potentially lower the minimum specs and allow more people to play the game.

P.S. On my friends laptop, he was getting ~20 fps on the lowest settings in an open field. This would drop to 5-10 when in a fight. I consider 20-30 playable, but I would consider anything lower that that unplayable.",FortNiteBR

Simply for holding this opinion, i've been downvoted to oblivion, PM'd about it, insulted and i've had my account stalked. Look, Epic have decided that the previous meta didn't suit their vision of the game. Why are we abusing players as a collective for simply having *opinions?* I see it so often it's becoming a normality, the downvote button is NOT a disagree button, and spouting abuse at people is even less acceptable.

I don't have a solution for this, but I'd at least appreciate a civil discussion about it. Most of my close friends (OG players) have left the game because of the descent and arrogance of the collective hivemind.

cmon this hype for the game is one explanation, it started with some people playing it,beacuse it was pretty NEW way of a game, allmost a bit like a cross between minecraft and a shooter game, then ninja started playing it, all the other people think: Hey if everyone plays this game, i think i should too!, and thats how the fortnite community grew and spread.

What also really makes me angry, there are entire YT channels, that base JUST ABOUT FORTNITE, like i mean the youtuber prestige clips makes allways just gta 5 stuff and montages, but his name isnt like those fortnite monatge youtubers that call them slefs: Fortnite Funny, yeah thats an actuall channel...

What really sucks about fortnite too is you cant get any new stuff, like a free dance or so, i mean buy v bucks in real money... It just makes my nervs explode...

What annoys me about that whole V bucks stuff too IS, this is a real story from my school,A guy im not gonna say his name,went with his friend to door to door from houses to get MONEY for his so called ""School projekt"", but in the break of the school he told us that he actually got some money, but he used it to buy playstation cards to get his V bucks...

So Fortnite community this is my experience with your crap game.",FortNiteBR

First of all: I have nothing against the player shown in the video. The whole point of this thread is to demonstrate that the Solo Showdown at it's current state has many flaws and shouldn't be used to give ""legitimate"" rewards.

¿What's the problem? As of the latest Solo Showdown, the access to a lobby with the current matchmaking system lends itself to abuse. If someone queues up at the same time as their friends/ viewers, that someone wil have advantage over the rest of the players that play as the showdown is meant to be played.

Benefits of queuing up with friends/ viewers (if you are a streamer): Free kills (Up to how many friends/ viewers access to your lobby), More chance to survive landing, Higher chance of having good weapons, Higher chance of getting shields, Less potentially good players in your lobby.

As a proof of my claims in provided in the Fortnite Competitive thread this video of player 9zis Zeko who achieved Place #3 in Br Region: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C8VpRAztWM&amp;t=29s

I'm going to update a new video with the count of how many free kills he got, and a translation in spanish of what he is saying.

I really want to know what you guys think about this, I certainly think is not fair, and how can EPIC solve this, maybe skill based matchmaking?",FortNiteBR

Since the drift is based of off a kitsune, maybe a lady with a kitsune mask and street clothes and instead of having a robe for her edit style, she should have a kimono.  Since Ragnarok is essentially the norse apocalypse, I think that his female counterpart should be Hel, the Norse ruler of the underworld.  It would be cool to se her rocking a tattered dress and a dark crown.  Her edit styles could possibly give her torn flesh, claw like fingers and a fancier crown.  Her back bling should be either related to a wolf, since she is heavily tied to wolves in norse mythology or a knife and a plate, as she is often depicted with them.  The knife represents famine and the plate represents hunger.  That's just my take on what the skins should be but feel free to tell me any changes you would make.",FortNiteBR

Coming from console it wasn’t very common to one pump someone so it was rewarding when you did hit someone for the nice 237. But with the double shotgun nerf and the Addison of the p90 the normal smg and the drum gun, and all of the smgs being very strong. Any shotgun cannot compete with smgs. In a 1v1 scenario, one has a smg one has a shotgun. Pumps dont do enough damage to beat the smg player. Assuming your hitting full 85 dmg bodyshots (which you probably aren’t) it will take 3 shots to kill. An smg wouldn’t lose against that time if you have good aim. For tacs you either have to hit 3 full bodyshots or a full heatshot and a body. For heavies, the have a lot more range than the other shotguns so they have their advantage in the aspect. However a heavys optimal range is also an smgs optimal range so smg wins. The only way these scenarios change is if The shotgunner is a significantly better player/builder.

This leads up to my point. The reason why I don’t like the smg meta or the general changes that epic has been making for the past few months is because it’s closing the skill gap. I think we can all agree that it is much more difficult to one shot someone for 237 to the head with a pump rather than to spray them with smgs. Or out build someone and outplay them than to overwhelm a player with splodes. Along with the build nerfs it’s clear epic wants to make this game easier for people who are newer to the game. Which makes since because all the little kids who’ve never touched a shooter in their life start playing fortnite. So it can be easier for them.

   First off, I want to thank Epic. Without fortnite and the cross play capabilities, I (ps4 at the time) wouldn't have been able to play with my best friend Dave (pc) for his last few months alive. 
Secondly, some background. I moved down to Florida when I was 17, back in 2015. I was in a really bad spot having just come from a fresh suicide in my family and an awful break up, and I met Dave during a GED course at the local community college. We hit it off immediately, and became best friends quickly. He got me into Dark Souls and we played it competing against eachother since we were on different consoles, and he showed me DnD as well, introducing me into some of my hobbies today. 

   Dave ended up moving to New York about a year after we met, and I moved to WV shortly after, but we always kept in touch, talking nearly every day through video chat or texting, but we were never able to game together as I didnt have a pc. I got really into fortnite during season 1, and managed to get Dave to play around Season 3, and cross play allowed us to play together. From then until late May, Dave and I would play every single day together, at least one game. We had finally found a game we could play together, and though we rarely won, we had a blast. We shared some experiences together playing Fortnite BR that we would've never gotten otherwise. 

   But one day, Dave didn't call, message or text me, or get online. I thought maybe he was busy with a girl or something, but after three days I contacted his cousin, who got his grandmother who was close by to check on him. Dave was found dead of suicide in May 18th, 2018. 

   I miss my best friend to this day, and I thank Epic for letting my friend and I actually play something together, and for letting me cherish our final few months together. I continue playing on without him, and as much as it sucks, I know he'd want me to keep fighting for that victory royale. 



On a side note, cherish what you have and who you know. You never know when everything will change without you even guessing it could happen. I love you Dave, it hasnt been the same since you left us.

Here are some of the things I recommend you do:

\- Nerf explosives

\- Stop nerfing building materials and building in general

\- Avoid making the SMG and explosives spam meta better (you did this by nerfing the mats healthbar)

STOP catering towards the less experience players in Fortnite, because it will drive the GOOD PLAYERS (Especially streamers, youtubers that play fortnite) to STOP playing your game. Even though you probably disagree, this will make the game better for everyone. If the bad players can't be bothered improving, its their loss.

But again, don't just listen to me. This is a discussion. Listen to your community.

ps. please fix replay mode building thx! :)",FortNiteBR

This is a repost of my thread started in the Fortnite Competitive sub reddit, link: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/93h296/feeding_w_kills_in_showdown_is_extremely_easy/

Hopefully, it will get more attention for the whole comunity:

""Now that the rankings have been released, I can finally post this here.

Back on the weekend I saw in Twitch that this streamer didn't black screen his stream when he queued up for his game, ... ¿result? free kills and shield, !even a chuc jug!

What do you guys think? Should the format change?¿Maybe a different matchmaking? We are talking about the dude that got place number 3 in BR Region.

Link to video:https://youtu.be/_C8VpRAztWM

EDIT: I waited to post this to wait and see if EPIC supervises this kind of stuff, clearly they DO NOT... and FEED KILLING is possible.""

Basically the third place in BR (https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/es-MX/news/solo-showdown-ltm-returns?sessionInvalidated=true) got a 27 kill game, leaving tilted with 18 and most of them being his fans that where watching his stream.

I am not trying to acuse 9zis Zeko of cheating, nor trying to discuss if it's his fault or not for not black screening his stream. My intention is to bring awareness of the flaws of the current state in Solo Showdown.

Leaving so much freedom for the players alterates the real ""competitive points"" one can earn. ¿Maybe a skill based matchmaking can change this? Im pretty sure that a competitive player wouldn't give one of his matches to his favourite streamer.

Anyways, I'd love to read your opinions.

This is just my opinion. If you don’t like it, sorry what can I do.

Daequan is like the wholesome streamer of fortnite. I can easily relate him to other wholesome gods like Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross. He gives great wholesome advice to people who donate regardless if there trolling or not and if someone donates asking to play with him he just says, “ just stream snipe me lol”. And towards the end of all his streams, he does snipe solos with viewers which I think is pretty smart. Nick Eh 30 is also a wholesome fortnite god like daequan but on youtube.

On the other hand, ninja gained the majority of his popularity from Drake. He seemed nice at first, but looking at pass stream videos of his shows a totally different streamer with a big ego. I also see that ninja easily gets butthurt from dying against other good players or getting stream sniped. I don’t know if other people notice this, but after getting a win, ninja will drink a bottle of beer after every win during ninja after dark, which I think is the only difference between his day streams.

What I'm referring to here is something I see on a daily basis watching my son play *AND* when watching streams that he wants me to watch.


What I'm referring to here is I'll repeatedly see multiple people at multiple areas all firing at the top of a tower that is being held up by *one wooden ramp*. Why don't more people destroy this weak point and collapse everyone up top and get free kills that way? Is it because you don't get the credit for the kill? (I don't play this, I'm asking)  Is it because ""*That's stupid because we want to shoot the person with the gun!*"" (*my son's answer to that question when I asked why not shoot that 1 ramp right there to bring down that entire tower of 3 people having a gunfight. *he's 13, didn't really expect a good answer lol*) 


*I feel the need to make sure people understand I'm not trying to change how anyone plays, I'm simply genuinely curious as to why exactly people outright ignore that they can sometimes shoot 2 wooden, half broken ramps/walls and it will bring down sky scrapers at times because people are too focused on going ""up"" than actually making sure that what their building is stable.*

How can your play-testers and analytics be telling you that a weapon like this belongs in Fortnite? Its uninteractive, horrible to play against, not gratifying to play with. If it's recon you're looking for then make it a uav drone that doesn't explode but shows enemy heat maps as you pass over head. You could even still 'rocket ride into battle' and use it to rescue teammates from the storm. But as it stands its just a slightly toned down version of a weapon that the majority of the playerbase wanted gone. Its annoying enough dealing with rpg and nade launcher spam, but at least I can work on my positioning and counter. But having remote controlled rockets that can come at me from literally any direction regardless of where the rocketeer is standing? Miss me with that guided shit. ",FortNiteBR

I think it could be tweaked a bit further, with another slight reduction in wood strength and a slight buff to brick strength. When 99% of the building in the game uses jist 1 material, that's a very clear sign that it is unbalanced. The last patch helped, but there are still issues. Wood is by far the most abundant resource available, and as a result should only be able to provide very temporary cover. The harvesting of rarer (and louder to gather) materials should in turn be rewarded. After all, even the 3 little piggies had this figured out: if you don't want your house blown down, don't build it out of sticks. Players on this sub love using 700 wood every single fight, but resource diversity needs to be improved with a better risk-reward payoff. I'll probably get downvoted for this, but the strength of wood in comparison to brick is comical, and a greater disparity in material strengths incentivizes the use of materials other than just wood.",FortNiteBR

That being said, we should not settle for just the reduced smg damage, if we want change we have to keep pushing for it.

Epic, I understand you don't like the turtle meta, but this type of nerf is only hurting your competitive scene.

Perhaps together we can come up with a solution for turtling. 
I propose adding a diminishing return for buildings, for example if someone is hiding in a one by one they can only replace each wall up to three times before they have to move. 
After which they must wait 5-10 seconds before they can replace the wall again.
This will force players to move out of their 1x1 boxes giving an opportunity to the aggressor to kill.
I'm not saying this is an immediate fix but adding small changes like this as opposed to just directly nerfing building would be a step in the right direction.

I’ve died by this bug 3 times in the past 2 days. 

It usually happens when you fire your shotgun then switch to your SMG. The SMG doesn’t fire until you let go of the fire button and press it again. 

I went into Playground mode to see if I could recreate this bug, and I was surprised at how easy it was. 

I got a Pump Shotgun, and an SMG. I shot with the Pump and quickly switched to the SMG. I did this 150x to test the results. Out of 150 times, the SMG did not fire after being switched too 9 times. That means the bug is occurs about 6% of the time (which sounds about right).

That 6% of the time comes by pretty quickly, and is really annoying when it’s the reason you die. 

As soon as you jump, let go of the aim button, or even fall off a cliff, the SMG will unclog and start shooting again. But walking, and other normal movements won’t unclog the gun. You’ll be holding the fire button on your button, but the gun won’t be firing. 

**TLDR:** Switching from Pump to SMG will sometimes make it where your SMG doesn’t fire despite you holding the fire button. After getting killed 3x in the past 2 days because of it, recreated the bug in Playground mode and found out it happens roughly 6% of the time. 

I’m sure this has happened to you guys in-game, but if you want to recreate this bug in Playground, it’s pretty easy. Get a Pump, get a SMG. Pretty much press the same buttons you would do during double-pump meta when you would double pump. The SMG will get stuck and not fire, despite you holding fire, around 6% of the time. ",FortNiteBR

if you’re building something or just messing around and maybe die to fall damage, it definitely be useful to no have to fly to the bottom of whatever mountain to retrieve your stuff.

&amp;nbsp;  

First of all guys, lets wish this young lad a healthy recovery and all the best in the future. Make sure you look out for anybody who you may see going down this path too, it is a serious issue and anything you can do to help, please make sure you do.  

&amp;nbsp;  

My problem here is the way that this article from MSN portrays Fortnite is absolutely disgusting. It's misleading, exaggerated and quite simply incorrect in many aspects.  

Let's review a few quotes from the article.  

*""Only a few months after first playing the game, he decided there was only one way to escape.""* - Implying that Fortnite was the sole reason he decided to attempt suicide. He's a 17yo lad, i'm sure there's many things he also first done months ago.  

""*Figures show that more than 5000 people tried to get help for gaming addictions over the past year""* - Fortnite has been downloaded over 125 million times. Lets assume every addiction case was from Fortnite, that would be 0.004% of the games player base.  

*""The idea that young kids are playing this is terrifying.""* - It's a cartoon! with no blood, no gore, no sex, no swearing, no drugs. 
 

""*Each time you’re killed you’re automatically dropped back into the battle zone, so it’s like being on an endless loop""*- We all know this is a straight up lie; you have to manually search for a new game yourself.  

""*all you want is to move up the rankings for more rewards and better status.""* - Rewards are capped at tier 100. According to Epic, reaching tier 100 takes between 75-150 hours. So after 150 hours (maximum) of gameplay there are no more rewards from epic.  

""*stole from his parents to pay for the game’s latest weapons and upgrades""* - You can not buy weapons or upgrades at all. All items are purely cosmetic and grant no competitive advantage.  

*""my mates said I should try playing with amphetamines""* - The article has blamed Fortnite for his drug addiction when his ""friends"" explicitly encouraged him to take drugs.  

And finally from the man himself *""I’m back playing cricket again now and studying for exams. It all feels like such a horrible dream""*  


&amp;nbsp;  

MSN should be embarrassed my the misrepresentation of Fortnite in this article. It has been a positive impact on so many of our lives and has bought an 800,000 strong community right here where we post memes, discuss content and share our favourite moments together.  

I'm glad the worst is behind him and seriously, I wish the best for this guy and I hope that he can recover and live the happy life which he deserves - with or without Fortnite involved.

Just thought that i'd let you know that when gyro aiming was first released, it felt flawless. It was incredibly responsive and felt just the same as if I was playing Splatoon 2 or Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But since you changed the Gyro aiming to rotate around the roll instead of the Yaw, when I play on my TV screen, split joycon, or with my Pro Controller, it feels ok with the Y axis, but the X axis feels like it is inverted. Please change it back to yaw, or give us an option to decide which motion aiming system we want to play with, because the roll system feels really awkward and I'm not having as much fun playing Fortnite on my Switch as when it was still based around yaw.

Hope you address this issue soon! (Also thanks a bunch for the crossbow in playground. ) ",FortNiteBR

Done. That's literally it, problem solved.    


The motion control is so much smoother since the big update recently, but unfortunately, the X axis is inverted on the pro controller - at least, insofar as it's usable - works great for handheld and using the joycons separately - but, not so much with the pro controller due to the inversion (or what acts, for all practical purposes, as an inversion) of the X axis.  


Allowing this to be inverted would honestly solve this problem, at least for me - the Y axis feels smooth as it is - could use some tweaking etc sure, but it \*feels\* good to me with the Pro Controller - just allow an X-axis inversion for it, and Switch players will have an excellent motion control system, playing the system docked or tabletop with a controller/Pro controller.  


Keen to hear from people - and other thoughts etc.  
There are so many other things I want, but this is something that honestly could be added in like 3 seconds silently, right, and it would be a huge improvement for us.

We have tried no. 1, no. 2, no. 5 and no. 8 (from the video above). No. 1 and no. 2 was just fine with 4 players, but then when we tried no. 5 and no. 8, we realised that they are better if we can get 8 players in the mode. The more the merrier. Bigger and better mini games can be made/played together. 

Besides mini games, increasing the player limit to 8 allow us to play proper squad vs squad matches. 4 vs 4. From this, we will see clan matches between rivalries. And trust me, clan matches will make players stick to this game longer.

* Remove the bloom on Assault Rifles, like how it was back in the early days. The gun play was actually great back then in my opinion.

At the current point in time a lot of the more experienced players are fed up with the new no skill spray meta. 

A gamemode that consists of only AR's/Bursts/All Shotguns/All Snipers is what I am suggesting. No explosives/SMG's/Tommygun/Minigun. Remove the no skill(spray and pray) weapons making it a more balanced game with the intended building meta. This mode would probably be more viable without the most recent shotgun update, bringing back season 4 double pump. 

Fortnite used to be if a player was significantly better they would win a fight 9/10 times vs someone. Now with all the explosives and garbage spray guns I'd say that  number would be closer to 7/10 times just because they are adding guns and more/stronger explosives that take no skill , no aim to cater to players of lower skill levels.

This is just a suggestion for a specific gamemode. If you support please upvote. If not please dont downvote to ruin it for the people that actually support and would like this gamemode.",FortNiteBR

Okay, yes the mirror is a poor place to get news from, so clearly the game is being misrepresented. However, am I the only one who reads these articles about fortnite addicts and thinks, ""This is just really poor parenting"" and/or ""This kids got more problems than just a gaming addiction"". 

In the first part of the article, the parents are quoted as saying "" We are good parents, we had no idea he was suicidal and in such a dark place"" and yet there is no mention of their own hypocrisy and they too are painted as victims. 

Then a while back there was the story of a 9yr old wetting herself to keep playing and both her and parent were again painted as victims; the game is a 12 - strike 1, games last at most 25min ish if your good -less if you play like me, so plenty of time for a bio break - strike 2, if you get a sudden urge to bio...bush camp/hide, if you still die, shit happens, literally in some cases but thats part of being a healthy human- strike 3, using a game console as a baby sitter instead of teaching your kid they can put the controller down proves you arent meant to be any position of authority over a child - strike 4! You are a crappy parent!! (Ive never played baseball)

This goes for older kids/teens too, if, referring back to the first article, your mates tell you to take methamphetamines to keep playing when you're tired, thats not a problem with fortnite, thats your shitty choice in friends and you're lack of self control.

I play on xbox and I've been playing since the beginning, I've dealt with all the changes.  I've spent a ton of money and love the game.  I don't mind the current weapon/meta state.  I was fine with shotguns and I'm fine with smgs/tommys/explosives how they are now.  What I'm not fine with is the constant nerf to building.  

This game is fun and unique because of the building.  All it is now is constant spam, explosive spam, lmg spam, tommy spam, smg spam, it's really out of hand (mostly squads/dous not so much solos.)  Building isn't as important as it used to be.  Walls are destroyed instantly.  

I played a game yesterday where I had a LMG/tommy gun and anytime I fought someone I wouldn't build and I'd just spam, I would aim at there walls and just shot without ADSing or anything.  Got 8 kills and won the game (squads).  

The argument is that epic is nerfing the building for the new players and noobs.  This doesn't make sense to me because the kids/noobs/new players are going to play regardless because this is a very fun game.  

There have been tons of complaints from people on here and streamers and epic isn't listening or doesn't care.  With everyone trying to get into the BR scene epic better start listening because another BR game can take fortnite's crown if the building continues in this horrible state.

I've played since the beginning and honestly never said this but the game is getting stale and for me it's honestly just because of how building has changed.  I loved build fights and spent a lot of work getting good sat them and now anytime you get the high ground on someone they just spam any weapon and you both are on the ground.

Personally, I like how Epic updates the current map a lot every season, however I’ve gotten tired of the game, and the current gun/playstyle meta and building nerfs don’t help much either. So why not just change up the whole environment? I wouldn’t say no to playing in an entirely fresh and new map with new POI’s to explore and places to fight. So why is it that a new map isn’t right for Fortnite? ",FortNiteBR

I wish Epic would take more time to shoot down and crush some of the suggestions on this sub. A lot of them are *really* bad and some would actually damage the game as well. Considering the fact that at any given time, more than half the front page here is occupied by skins, weapon ideas, and other general garbage that the game doesn’t need  - I’d appreciate Epic crushing and destroying poor ideas before they gain any traction. 

Example: PS4 and Nintendo Switch crossplay.

I'll take a green hunting rifle over a gold bolt action almost every time.

Far easier to quickscope imo and it's awesome to hit an easy body shot on an opponent before rushing. Also way quicker reload time.

The simple solution? Make weapons (or at least shotguns) retain their post-firing delay when switched away from.

**Personally**, I feel that the bunny hopping, ghost peeking, one/two shot kills are a massive detriment to the game experience, and it feels incredibly out of place.

**Why?**

Other firearms do abysmal burst damage in comparison, obviously. If you're not carrying a shotgun by the time you encounter someone, you're screwed if you engage in a build battle. Between the lower damage of other weapons, bloom, and the need to remain exposed for concentrated fire, the disadvantage is enormous, compared to being able to quickly peek and have a massive hitbox for instant heavy damage.

Now, obviously, shotguns are the most common weapon in the game. You can literally find them everywhere, so why would you ever be without one? Well, variety is a thing. I'm bored of using shotguns. It sure feels good to land that one hit kill, but it's **so boring**. 

Every close range battle plays out exactly the same, it has for months. Build on top of each other, shoot once, continue building, repeat.

It's even more fun with the addition of every player running double shotties! So much for weapon balance, as one can bypass the restrictions by being ever so *skilled* to carry two guns. The recent shotgun nerf was a good thing, it helped to remedy a massive issue, however it ignored the bigger part of the problem and completely missed double shotguns. In fact because of the lower damage, there have been more people running that loadout than ever before, because they can no longer get their one hit kills.

---

Lets look at the rest of the game, not involving shotguns. Players are powerful, we can have up to 200 HP. Healing and shields are limited, and using them is a slow process. Ranged battles can last minutes or end immediately depending on how well a player can aim their weapon. ^^^or ^^^how ^^^bloom ^^^chooses ^^^to ^^^act

Explosives are a very easy counter as simply building one wall can be enough to block all damage entirely. That is what balances out the RPG, preventing it from being incredibly overpowered. It requires *some* thought in use, searching for open windows to attack, or to trick the enemy into exposing themselves. Grenade launchers are balanced out by their massive ammo consumption, high grenade bounce, and their limited range.

Sniper rifles don't quite need a description, you just have to be *good* to get your hits in. Unlike shotguns, getting a head shot with a sniper rifle is a much harder task to pull off. Incredibly skillful, or lucky, a head shot kill with a sniper rifle **should** be **the only** weapon type able to do so much damage. In comparison, anyone can get shotgun head shots easily due to the massive, **hit scan hit box** floating in the center of your screen.

I rarely see SMG's or pistols used, at all. I almost never see one dropped from a player unless it's 2 minutes into the game. No one keeps them because shotguns trump everything else at close range. 

Revolvers and hand cannons are probably my favourite weapons in the game. They're incredibly balanced. Slow firing, but high damage in reward for your accuracy. My only complaint is the damage drop off distance. These weapons tend to be useless in medium range because of how weak the bullets become over a short distance, and, obviously, at short distance trying to rely on the games RNG over the massive shotgun hitbox is a death sentence. 

---

So what do we do? It's clear that the vast majority of the community wants the game to constantly be morphed into a rapid, constant action shooter, pushing away from a slower paced, tactical thinking game. Just look at the recent material nerf complaints. It's fine, if you're stuck with out materials then it's your own fault for wasting time not collecting between encounters. It takes a minute to gain 200 wood.

 **In my opinion**, the push to change the game into that is going to kill it. People are going to become bored with it because if you don't conform with the meta, you're going to have a hard time enjoying yourself. It's going to raise the learning curve immensely.

I feel that the game can be faster, but with very specific changes. Recoil should be introduced, and bloom must be reduced, not eliminated, to allow for better aim with other weapons. This would immediately bring more variety to the battle, making pistols, SMG's, and the revolver/hand cannon a viable combat option. At the same time, it'll reward players for learning to aim. 

Shotguns seriously need to go. They need to take a back seat. Their damage is perfect now after the nerf, and changing them further having extreme pellet spread, to prevent the ridiculous ranged damage that currently exists, will balance them out nicely. A player should be right up in your face to take the full damage of a shotgun, not 2 floors down and across the fucking street.

I work 9-5 and don't have time to no life the game, but by using fortnite mobile. Okay okay, hear me out. this isn't the best way to farm XP, but it takes little to no effort. 

Using u/iH8t1a 's s4 xp chart, [linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkGH4AoireMrVs_x9MZp2p8NTXjZqV8oZqD5mnYUGnM/edit#gid=0) , I was able to calculate that from my level currently, lvl 69, there is 206,000 XP until lvl 80.

A normal solos match with placement in top 10, 0 kills, and 120% battle pass xp = about 744 xp total. Each game like this takes anywhere from 10-15 mins. using this info, 206,000/744= Roughly 276 games, and with the season ending in about 24 days (july 12), I need to play at least 11 games a day with placement in the top 10, no kills. Easy. Multiply that by 15 mins per game, and its 172 mins basically AFKing in fortnite a day to get to omega.

Obviously this leaves out actual gameplay and weekly/daily challenges, where xp gain will be much greater. ",FortNiteBR

now to my point the learning curve for new players right now is insane and is too steep. i've convinced several friends in the past couple of weeks to download fortnite and give it a shot, given that i would show them the ropes. of the 8 recent people i tried to convert only 1 lasted over a week. and these are all cod gods like myself (5+ k/d and can carry a team by themselves).  they just get shit on over and over again.

now i know the average reddit user is going to say tough shit that's the game... but the game will be dead if you can't convince new players to stick around and the old players will start to quit too when there are no newbs to kill. 

for a new player to even have a slim chance they have to master these skills at a minimum:
*build first. shoot second. (harder than it sounds for most competitive shooter types)
*defensive building when shot at. 1x1 and to be able to tell where a shot is coming from (harder than it sounds because audio is trash in this game... example tilted ""is he above me or below me... fuck""
*offensive building for height - high ground wins... well then low ground makes you a loooooser! and everyone in this game is sweaty as fuck and a builder pro right now (including me).
*not sure what to title this but attacking at the right angle. from your right side. since your guns on your right if you have to shoot left your entire body is exposed when shooting. 

i'm sure theres more but my casual friends are no longer playing this game for the same reasons i can't get people to convert. they can't compete... and that is the start of the end for a game.  

truthfully there should be a game mode for players with less than 50 wins that limits materials to 300 total carry.  that's enough to ramp rush, get high ground, etc but not enough to overwhelm complete noob players.",FortNiteBR

Dealing with the ping hadn't been too bad since Fortnite wasn't a game that required too much from your internet connection, every now and again it would be frustrating when you get a hit marker just before you die (but nothing comes up indicating how much you hit them meaning the shot didn't register on the server side, only client side) on the person on 5HP that just killed you and you know that if it wasn't for your ping, the shot would have in fact registered and you would have won the battle. 

This would get annoying but it wasn't a big deal and you'd just carry on playing because you're used to it. This all changed with the new double pump, double shotgun meta. The meta where switching your weapon quickly is crucial in a battle. As you may have guessed, the problem is that those of us with high ping cannot do this at all. By the time our weapon has switched, the other person has already landed another shotgun blast into your face and you're dead. This gets so frustrating after a while as you just can't do anything close-range in this meta unless if Lady Luck handed you a miraculous one pump (R.I.P shotguns). 

There's so many more issues with having ping such as building, getting shot behind cover, general timing out if the server dies for a split second and more but I'm not going to rant on. I took to Reddit in the hope that this might get the attention of an Epic employee and they could help a community out as the whole of the African player base can be saved.

TL:DR - High ping in areas such as South Africa really messes up aspects of the game for players and am asking for any chance of servers closer than Europe",FortNiteBR

A gun where the bullets land where you shoot or a gun when it's just random if you hit a bullet.

So I want to clarify that I'm a very old player here. Joined the community in early January.

I want to give my honest opinion, if this matters to Epic at all. I am a very experienced player at fortnite, got tons of wins and kills(not bragging). I have supported this game at all times for the fun I've had playing this game and the time I spent with friends trapping newbies, driving shopping carts across fields and etc. However, recently I'm feeling that Epic are slowly killing all the fun this game stood for and what made it unique among games like PUBG. For example, instead of going for kills, I have to farm and farm and farm all the time. 15 minutes of farming and then you get killed because the shotguns are doing 9 damage (sometimes 0) or because someone went through your wall. And then the cycle continues. In very sick of hitting trees with my axe 70% of the game. This game is very unique because building was a new concept. If you're going to make it hard to use this unique ability then why have it at all.
And if you don't farm for at least three quarters of the match, chances are you'll get outbuilt and pumped on the back of your head
In short, making players hit trees with their pickaxe for 70% of the game makes it boring and repetitive and that's why I'm having a break until I feel like playing this farming simulator again. I hope most of people here feel like me.

In my opinion holidays skins  should stay vaulted, because they are getting rarity over time and that's a important part of the game, because people can see how long you play the game + even that you got faith in the game for buying skins like skull trooper when you didn't even know that this game gets so big, when fortnightmares were present you just wanted to support developers and see game growing and that's one of the reason that i think early holidays skins should stay vaulted. I don't want to be selfish or anything but epic would kill skins like skull trooper if it made apperance once again, because everyone would buy it and rarity would be gone. Same goes for almost every holiday skin so EPIC PLEASE DON'T BRING BACK HOLIDAYS SKINS.

Fortnite had a problem the first minute that it got released. The name of that problem is Bloom.
It shouldnt be a gameplay mechanic that a *generator* is in control of the damage i make. It should be decided by where i hit my target, how i hit it and with what i hit it. ) Damage with a headshot shouldnt be a thing! One of the reasons why shotguns were popular is that they were consistent with thier damage.

some days ago i discovered a vid with over 3 Mio View and 100k likes talking EXACTLY about the same points i will mention in this post.... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGJ6rD3Gz28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGJ6rD3Gz28)

i just want to share my thoughts with u guys, so.....

idk but i feel like epicgames launches only rly bad patches and completely bad nerfs and buffs,.... the last 3 patches were awful and it is getting more and more ""noob friendly"" (for exaple: the jatpack was the worst item in the game and it was there for like a months,.... with the jatpack every noob was able to beat a better player and that item was op af, no fall dmg, ez highground etc... )

\- Now the materials are reduced too( u can find only 20 stacks, the lama is useless af 200 from each mats ....) and u have to farm even longer, and that is not the funny part of the game i would say....

\-even streamers dont play as much fortnite anymore and some of the pros nearly quitted already ( for example: ninja is not only playing fortnite now, instead he is playing realm royal,... and there are **many other** streamerss too )

[https://clips.twitch.tv/PunchyCorrectSangSeemsGood](https://clips.twitch.tv/PunchyCorrectSangSeemsGood)&lt;-- clip of dakotaz

\-fortnite needs something new ..... the game is getting boring and they need to stop adding noob friendly items to the game .... it started with the port a fort, and after that is was always worse ( the new turbo building is bad for the pros too)

the new weapons they added are bad too,... ( the thermal scope AR is not fortnite anymore i woudl say ......)

\-the battle pass is a nice extra for the game but after a few seasons it will be the same too,..... we have season 4 rn and not even the battle pass hypes the game anymore, i mean it has a nice storyline and stuff but thats it,... and the map is getting changed a little bit ....... cool

the challanges are almost the same every time but a little bit different.... -

( e.g.: collect Fortnite letters, collect ducks, collect mountain peaks ect....)

(2. example: kill 3 people there,kill 2 people here, kill 3 enemies in this city...)

(3. e.g.: kill 5 enemies with this weapon, kille another 5 enemies with that weapon...)

.... i have about 250 wins in total but i already saw every corner of the map and it's getting boring. idw to imagine what a player feels like with 1000 s of wins,....

\-The best what epicgames could do for seasons 5 is a new map,.... it would totally refresh the game and there would be a new reason for the hype too.... thats the only thing

if there will be no new map in season 5 and epicgames will carry on and launches bad patches into the game fortnite will die soon,....

comment your thoughts guys.... do u feel the same ? am i the only one ?",FortNiteBR

Do you ever play the Pistol?, i don't mind if grey/green or blue.
I have to be honest,... I never play this gun and my friends neither. Except for the time u landed and found nothing else.

So here is my suggestion to swap this weapon with something more special.
Most of u should know the Glock-18, its a pistol with burst and single-shot. Known in csgo, battlefield and so on.

I am convinced the Glock would be a more viable weapon to use in early fights. I would use this.

I love Fortnite and I love the concept of Battle Pass because it spices up the game plus it really helps you to get better at the game, you learn the whole map and train to use every weapon. Sometimes you get tired of chasing victories and then you focus on solving challenges. It's fun and it's not even about the reward but the thrill of accomplishment. I had stress last season to get 110th tier. Now I am better and 100 tier is not an issue but farming XP... Man... I play with friend everyday who has battle pass and we share xp boost. I cannot make others to just buy battle pass so I could farm more. 

Don't get me wrong, the thrill is real and I am loving it. But I became obsessed with this lately. I have to balance my life with work, girlfriend, family, summer season is on and it would be good for me to get out and see some sun ain't I? I am failing to balance it while I overplaying Fortnite. I cannot just let go, and I have to work another job soon and friend is getting a lot of freelance work, it is a torture. Please Epic don't be so ruthless...

But from a players and viewers perspective, 3rd person camera views are and will always be inferior to 1st person. In Fortnite however you have always been able to work around the 3rd person advantage by having the ability to easily reposition and outplay your opponents. But as metas change and the skill base gets higher(ghost peeking, pre-aiming snipes, left shoulder camera, ect), the more and more people abuse 3pp because if you *dont* your at a disadvantage. Its the reason I gave up on this game in 2017, in favor of PUBG/other FPS. But saying that, this game has really shown its potential and scalability in the past 6 months, and im positive that everyone here wants the best for the game. At this point and with Fortnites ever growing population, segregating the player base to include 1st person in the main playlists would have no negligible effects- unlike PUBG and their struggles/compromises.

So in order to qualify for the clan you must be a decent player who is willing to communicate with other players. You’ll tryout with some of our other members and collectively all of those who participated will vote you in or out. But don’t be worried about not making it because we are not very strict so if you can only push up with “W” like Daquan or build like Myth or sharpshooter enemy’s from distance with an ar or sniper or just give battle strategies it’s fine. We have other players just like you and we want to work to get groups of players together with different skill sets that should help you guys secure a dub. If your just an all out amazing player don’t think that you’re too good either we have members with 200+ dubs on mobile in only these short 3 months of Fortnite mobiles existence. So if you would like to join just leave a comment saying that you added me and/or LLGNoraa in game, your server region, and a good time to play in your time zone. When we are ready to play I’ll leave you a PM to go ahead and hop on with us. If you have any questions feel free to leave them in the comments.                                                                              -LLGDaCe",FortNiteBR

For the record:

* I’m at battle pass level 49, with 7/10 stars.

* I’m at Season Level 33.

* I’ve got 10 Stars left in week 5, 15 in week 7, and 5 in the basic challenges. I’ve also got three secret battle passes left to get.

* I have a challenge yet completed today, and only 22 days left in the seasons.

Nowadays people care more about skins than the goddamn gameplay which by the way has been stomped into the ground by Epic Games’s so called “balance changes”. If anything they’ve messed things up with these “balance changes”. They have subtly changed some of the core elements of how the game used to play. Take the pump shotgun for example. Everyone can agree that in the beginning they used to be overpowered. But holy crap, what have they done to it? I’m embarrassed to say that I prefer a heavy shotgun over a pump shotgun BECAUSE IT DOES MORE DAMAGE. The rest of the game is full of crappy bugs which make no sense. But Epic Games is too busy shitting out skins and shitty weapons no one asked for. The only changes they’re willing to make is those that close the skill gap. I wouldn’t be surprised if building would be “nerfed” because it creates a skill gap. Fuck this game and fuck it’s fan base.",FortNiteBR

I was on youtube the other day watching some old fortnite squad invitationals and everyone in the comments were pouring salt and hate on some team that won because they camped till the final few people.

My question is this: do kills REALLY matter that much if you dont get that victory royale. I understand if youre just trying to increase your KD but im talking about playing to win the game. For example the other day I won a match and I had 4 kills because I landed at a low traffic area. Does that really make me a bad player? Think about it. If Lady Bright Bomber kills 3 no skins, 2 rust lords, a skull trooper with a gold scar, 2 omegas and 2 john wicks and then in the final two people she 1v1 some camper and she loses doesnt that technically make the camper the better player in the lobby because he beat the player at the top of the food chain?

Its not like the camper ""snuck up"" from behind and had a free head shot. Its always a true 1v1 in the final circle because there arent any other distractions or free headshots from behind. They had a real 1v1 and Lady Bright Bomber lost. 

I dont understand why so many people have been brainwashed by streamers to think that only people with 15+ kills are actually decent players.

I truly believe that camping in a 1 by 1 is in no way cowardly. Even Ninja and marshmallow camped in a 1 by 1 at E3.

Every time I go against someone good and end up winning I am low in materials and so is that person, and I need to be farming and farming, and the time I go against another good player I mostly doe running out of materials.

Pretty much the more you engage in fights, the more in a disadvantage you are. Materials is my biggest issue, but not only that also how dry mid game feels since storms take forever to close and there is only 30 people left before the first storm even closes.

I wish they would buff materials 20-30% or just keep Blitz permanently.

There is people here who say the current material state is good, it is not.

I think Blitz is 100% more competitive because of the materials. You do not have excuses for losing in Blitz like running out of materials, when in normal mode it is one of the biggest reasons.",FortNiteBR

2) A pyramid. Yes, I know many have built them and even a YouTuber made the world's biggest pyramid in Fortnite [here](https://youtu.be/vKZEOjq8NsE). But for this one, it's going to be fair size with spray paint for hieroglyphics, spike booby trap, a small maze and a pharaoh's tomb inside.

Since I imagine there be no storm with unlimited time to play around without worrying about demolition teams of players destroying your work. I can imagine some very cool structures being built. Maybe even the Statue of Liberty in New York or even a Star Destroyer out of Star Wars (queue the Imperial March theme here) being built.

Bloom is a bad gameplay mechanic and it has almost no positive effects. Add bullet drop/travel time, but bloom just is broken

I think these material nerfs have completely punished any sort of aggressive gameplay and build battling. You can't get into any sort of build fights without draining your material to literally nothing, and when you kill your opponent, you are not rewarded with mats since THEY TOO have chosen to play aggressively. The main change I've noticed since the nerfs is the amount of people who camp in 1x1s.  Don't get me wrong, I understand that bases are a big part of the game and 1x1s are core. But there is a problem when the circle in tiny and there are ELEVEN players stationed in 1x1s, each too afraid to make a move out of lack of materials. Any aggressive player who tries to make a move in this scenario is instantly punished by all the other campers. In general, all that came of these material nerfs is an increase in campers and 1x1 sitters and a severe decrease in skillful gameplay and interactive build fights. It's truly a shame that they've disregarded what truly made this game different and I really hope they change it.

TLDR: Material nerfs cause a spike in camping and decrease in aggression, not good for the game. ",FortNiteBR

So am trying to improve my game, my K/D is 2 and i have won like 10 solos which is not bad am trying to get 5-7 K/D and more wins. so i was wondering what do you guys think if i should switch to a k+m or maybe switch console. When i play on pc i feel really slow when building and people build really fast in pc, i use combat pro config and its really hard to build. Aim assist its like almost 0 on shotguns and smgs at closed range, 0 aim assist with snipers and AR only works well at mid range. weapon switching is a problem intead of pressing 2 or 5 to switch you need to press the buttons until you reach the item or gun and same with the building. So my questions are how much better is the keyboard and mouse in &amp;#37; compared to the controller? Should i buy a good keyboard and mouse for PC? or should i switch to a console i have a Nintendo Switch which matches you with same console most of the time? I just want your opinion on this.

However, I have a PS4 account that is linked to my Epic Account and this creates a huge issue, when trying to enjoy Fortnite on my Nintendo Switch with all my current progress on PS4, iOS, and PC, I was unable to do so because my account had an “Forbidden Platform” connected to it. Right before this I had bought the new Omen skin with the new axe and was really hyped to try it on my Nintendo Switch once it was finished downloading. However, once it was finished downloading, I of course got the message “Forbidden Platform.” So I created a new account and bought the Battlepass for a SECOND time in Season 4. This was extremely infuriating to me as it was, but to make it even better, I contacted Epic Support. This is where I’m about to lose it so I explain I am the owner of both accounts and I would like help either fixing the problem by somehow making my PlayStation account not connected and my Nintendo Switch account connected, I explained that if this wasn’t possible I would at least like to request Fortnite PVE and my items be given to me on my new account, but no “We don’t give items by request.”

The map was bare but that also meant there wasn’t 20 people before the 1st circle closed, the weapon selection was great, two rifles, two shotguns, two sniper, and two explosives. Building was rare but still used and THERE WAS THE OLD MUSIC! There was no weapon delay and no double pumping. The winner of a fight was the skilled one and not the one using two pumps and wall glitching. The game was so much better in general and I think most ogs will agree (season 1&amp;2 skins were best too). 

Lately I have felt the game is not fun to play anymore for various reasons:

Double pumping 

RNG loot and Bloom

Too many names locations

Too many people die before the first circle even closes! 

Llama nerf

Inconsistency of guns in general 

Thirsting players

I made a post a week back actually complaining about the amount of xp needed to reach lvl 80, I see now looking back on the grind that it's possible. The two main tips I have are don't go for high kill games, from my experience even 2 kills (as campy as it is) provided simmilar xp that 6 kills would give, kills are not as important as winning (#1 gives most xp). The 2nd tip is don't play solo, play duo or squad with friends, as long as you have one friend with friend xp boost, you're set. Following these 2 steps assured around 1800 xp per win.

Summary:
1: wins are more important than high kills
2. play with at least 1 friend

this way the building won’t be forced to push you down because there is no way down.

If the map is completely relayered multiple times there is no issue with people being able to glitch with carts or old building mechanics. 

Also, adding indestructible structures will allow people who are able to glitch under the inability to kill enemies under the map, which is unlikely. 

2) Re-instate the old building mechanics. Now no one can abuse unsolid structures/phase thru walls/shoot thru walls, appearing as if there is one.

By this point: you could reach lvl 80 but the grinding you’ll have to do to get there means you’ll probably not do anything else for the next 3 wks.
It is highly unlikely you will but if you do congrats your achievement is a complete skin.

Could I reach tier 100: absolutely, and without buying your way there. You still have a couple of wks left with challenges, XP gains from battles, free secret tiers, etc. Less of a grind here but you can do this one assuming you’re at least on tier 80+ (roughly)

Is it worth buying a battle pass at this point: No. Not really. You could and then could buy your way to omega but that’s not really worth your money. A lot of us have had battle passes for a couple of seasons now or at least started a lot earlier which meant we could casually work our way up.

So, after being oblivious to the fact that the season ends in ~20 days I found myself in a position of being far behind everyone else in terms of levels, and I'm pretty sure a few people are in a similar boat. But luckily after a bit of researching and testing I have found a few methods that can really boost your levels faster than usual.

I am now back on track, going from level 51 on Friday to level 60.6 earlier today. I will most likely reach level 80 with a few days to spare

(1) Playing with people who have a battlepass
Yes, this seems kind of obvious, but this really helps quite a lot. Grinding with my no-skin buddies I found myself gaining one or two levels a day after a few hours of playtime, but when I made the switch to my friends with the battle pass today, we got 2-3 levels in a few hours.

(2) 50 v 50 LTM (if you're tired and not looking for an intense game)
Constantly playing over and over again can get a bit tiring, especially for the whole squad, but playing 50v50 can get you XP while you mess around with your friends. I got around 900-1000 xp per game just from messing around with my friends.

(3) Make sure you get to Tier 100 as fast as possible
As many of you are aware once you reach Tier 100 any battle stars that you earn are converted to XP points. 1 Battle star is equal to 100xp. I have personally set a goal to get to Tier 100 by this Friday, giving me 2 weeks of challenges and 16 daily challenges. This is equal to about 28000 xp, which is nearly 3 levels. (That's quite a lot the closer you get)

(4) The last tip, and everyone's least favourite, AFK'ing.
This is for anyone who is either tired or limited for time. Just jump out the bus in the middle of your map, pull out your shoot and wait for the first circle. Then go to the middle of that circle, hide in a bush, and come back in 10 minutes. A typical game like this gives my 700-900 xp. This actually got me about 3-4 solo wins in the last 2 days, purely from coming back with 4 people left, finding some leftover loot and finishing them off.

(5 - bonus) Win your games lol

So yeah hope this is hopeful to some people, I know I could have really used this when I started grinding. Just remember, survival time &gt; kills when grinding for XP..",FortNiteBR

That's what pumps need, they should revert the damage to 90 and 95 but keep the 2x headshot multiplier, that way there's no one pump 200hp player garbage, and none of the double pump garbage. I want to be able to carry something else besides two pumps and not get outgunned, and with the damage nerf on them, there's no waiting for the double-pump scum to jump into the air and oneshot them like I used to be able to. Also, every time I get into a fight, my connection to the server goes ""Oh, were you using that 40 ping? Well, here's 700, have fun asshole!""

I’ve been playing Fortnite for a while (proudly rocking the Black Knight) and I’ve had an idea that I’ve wanted to share for a while but never had the time to really explain it.
Well, I finally found some time, so here it is.

LTM “Scavengers”
Last player alive wins. No rules.

Basically I was thinking it could be like a real battle royale. The mic communication would be based off proximity. You could call out to other players and ask if they wanted to team up or fight each other. Teams, and really the whole gameplay would be decided entirely by the players.
There would be new elements of mystery. For instance, you see 3 guys in your team go around a  building and when you get there, there’s 2 and now you have to be even more cautious and on the lookout (similar to the feeling of playing TroubleInTerroristTown)
Late game combat would be pure chaos with teams turning on each other while fighting others teams.

I love fortnite and I love the skins they add. I think they could do really well from an mmorpg standpoint and I’d love to see more of that implemented into BR. Could be my wishful thinking though.
What do you guys think?

In save the world there are usually daily challenges that are much easier to get than a win, and they give you 50 v-bucks. There is currently no other way to get v-bucks other than the ones you get from the battle pass. (Which most people use to buy the next battle pass) and I think if you win enough to get a skin you deserve it, because not everyone can afford to buy their favorite skin when it comes out. I think this is a fair suggestion and would love to see it implemented in the game. :)

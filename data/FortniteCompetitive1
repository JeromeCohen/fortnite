Dubs, Bugha, Aspect, and MSM are all great examples of players that just w-key to their limits. Much like the turtle meta was pioneered by the Liquid Boys (Chap and Poach I'm looking at you), this meta was originally championed by Zexrow around the winter royale event. Zexrow was the original w-keyer, and if you watch VODs from that time, you can see just how much more aggressive he is than most of the other excellent players during that time. He relied on getting into boxes, incredible aim, confidence and w-keying to make his points off of elim's, much like most of the world cup qualified players. I find this incredibly interesting - especially considering his current issues with his hand. 

&amp;#x200B;

 Firstly, I wondering how Zexrow would have performed in the current meta if he had been healthy. Would he have dominated the leaderboards and qualified first week, or would he have struggled to w-key in a world of w-keyers? In the winter royale, the first open qualifer, he came 4th in NA, and 73rd in Europe (on 100+ ping). The format at the time wasn't even as reliant on kills, and followed the point after 3,5 and 7 kills rule - making it difficult to make points off of kills, as only 2 kills would leave you with nothing. This made placement valuable, and a more consistent, viable strategy. Top 10 was 1 point, top 3 was another, and a VR was 3. With this strategy, Zexrow excelled in OPEN qualifiers - as easily shown by his winter royale qualifer placement. However, it's clear that in a strictly solo format, Zexrow fails to be consistent, or even place for that matter. This brings me to what I'd like to base this post around; How will the current meta play out in the world cup - that is, how will will players who relied on aggression, w-keying and kill-points place against players who play much to the same style?

&amp;#x200B;

 I'd like to preface this by stating that I am not out to complain about format/meta - I simply want to discuss and consider how the meta may play out on the world stage, and see how my predictions fair (Maybe I'm an armchair aficionado, or maybe my observations have some merit). 

&amp;#x200B;

  Based on what we've seen from Zexrow, I predict two things will happen:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Players who relied on w-keying, aggression and kill points in SOLO open qualifiers will place poorly in the world cup and ultimately disappoint.
2. Players in the DUOS format with ONE player who relies on this ""Zexrowian"" playstyle and ONE player with a more passive, focused playstyle will ultimately place much higher.

&amp;#x200B;

 If we take a look at Zexrow's solo placements in any event final it's clear that he struggles to perform, and cannot consistently find points to place highly, or win the event. Winter Royale he came 90th, Secret Skirmish he came 22 and at Katowice he again placed 22nd. It's important to keep in mind that Katowice followed the current fortnite system to an extent, that is, points were awarded for each kill. At each of these events, Zexrow wasn't playing against the players that epic's open matching-making system had determined were ""good enough"" - he was playing against players that could be considered Top 100-200 in the world. *If you cannot consistently practice this playstyle against players that are of the same calibre of skill as you or higher, you will not succeed in using it against them.* It is one thing to play against the top 3000 and string together kills, but it's another to succeed in doing it against players who can be considered top 100 in the world. You cannot w-key each box and expect to easily get in, kill them and move on to the next one. 72hrs mentioned that when Dubs takes what everyone considers a ""50-50"" and jumps into a box, he's not actually 50-50ing them. He knows that he needs to jump into his opponents box, kill them, take their loot and move on. He can choose the time he jumps in, how he jumps in, and what he can use before he jumps in (stinks, boogies, taking a wall/roof). His opponent may not even know whether or not he'll just turtle up or jump in. He has the odds every single time he takes this type of fight against someone who likely has much higher ping than him, has likely practiced quite a bit less than him, hasn't had this scenario happen to him again and again and who likely hasn't practiced, doesn't have the same mechanics, and who doesn't have the same level of game sense as him. *Even in a top 3000 format*. There's likely the same types of disparity in the top 200-300 range. If we take a look at people who have won at events, either online or at a Lan, we see that it's mostly solo players who minimize 50-50 risk, understand the level of players they're playing against, and who understand that game-sense trumps mechanics at the highest level. Vivid, Bizzle, 72hrs and Mitr0 are all excellent examples. Vivid and Bizzle in particular - each of them understand the game with exceptional clarity, and though their mechanics and aim may not be as good or even great as those who they are playing against, their game sense and ability to put themselves in excellent positions is what allows them to consistently grab points and place well. Overall, I believe high ping, gifted mechanical players will place poorly in the world cup, as evidenced by Zexrow in past performances, and by who has placed well in past performances. 

&amp;#x200B;

 This brings me to my second point  - this Zexrowian playstyle is good for two things, placing well in qualifiers and duo tournament finals. From Katowice alone, we can see how well the Zexrow - Vinny duo placed (3rd). When when teammate is a little more calm, level headed and commanding while the other can play aggressively, w-key and is confident going for kills, said duo will excel. Animal/Aspect, Mitr0/Mongraal, Tfue/cloak and Aydan/Sean are all wonderful examples. Notable exceptions to this ""theory"" are Benjy/MSM and Zayt/Saf (and as a side note, these are the two duos I'd predict  to take it). When when teammate can keep a level head while the other creates chaos and is directly correctly, it makes for quite an effective duo and allows this type of playstyle to actually flourish. 

&amp;#x200B;

  In summary, I believe the current meta will lead to a disparity during the solo portion of the world cup where aggressive, low ping, excellent mechanically players will under perform, whereas players who are more focused on positioning, picks and game sense will outperform.",FortniteCompetitive

78,CoWsterr,1561082130,c34l66,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/c34l66/epic_employees_please_help/,1,Epic Employee's Please Help!,"For some reason, when you die and a guy you have knocked dies you do not get the point for it when your kill counter actually goes up. So, are the rules not actually 1 point per 1 kill because we clearly saw our kill scores increase. These kills would go to stats and everything so why can we not receive points for them.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another bug we ran into was that we lost our game 7. My duo crashed and I left before the bus. Epic made it so that leaving before the bus with a crashed/kicked duo would not give you a penalty.  

&amp;#x200B;

If we had that one point from the kill, we would move from #1549 (as seen here: [http://prntscr.com/o4mv5w](http://prntscr.com/o4mv5w) ) to here #1368 (as seen here: [http://prntscr.com/o4mv0v](http://prntscr.com/o4mv0v) and [http://prntscr.com/o4muxy](http://prntscr.com/o4muxy) )  

&amp;#x200B;

Epic has shown that they are willing to correct mistakes (C9 player where 20ish points were taken from his score because of the changes to having a partner d.c in the lobby). I feel my duo and I were wronged here because of the point that was taken from us. This has been going since the beginning of the popup cups and should have been fixed months ago. All we want to do is play in the finals tomorrow and continue to compete. Hopefully Epic fixed the C9 situation not because he was on C9 but because it was the right thing to do, and I hope they will continue to do the right thing and right this wrong.

Always using the right amount of materials (never unnecessary), they almost never lose the high ground and make sure that opponents have a hard time contesting by cleverly positioning and being very aware of the situation. They also use the right mobility at the right time. They never give the enemies a room to breathe. And they do this on a very consistent basis. I am quite impressed by them.

So I want to ask some questions that I've always wondered,  


1- Do Epicgames make you a private discord and invite the qualified players to give them instructions/train daily for the world cup finals in NYC?  
2- Do Epicgames give any papers that help foreigners to get a Visa to travel to US ""Some papers to give to the embassy to be accepted for the Visa""? What happens if you don't get the visa for some reason? Will you still get the 50k? will be there any otherways that epicgames can convince the embassy ""as long as your file is clean but still they won't accept you""?  
3- Do they give prizes ""Money prizes"" earlier before you travel to US ""not the 50k Prize"" to help poor players to use it in the US?  
4- Do they pay for a hotel/plane ticket for you or do you pay for all of that yourself including accommodation?  
5- what happens if a certain player couldn't travel for some reason ""personal issues, illness or refused by the embassy"" will they try to replace them with the next player qualified or they will Just start without these players?

I and many others would agree that the game needs to have a way of testing items before they are added to comp playlists.  The first option is to have items to be added to normal playlists for a period of time before they are added to comp.  While this is good on paper it is difficult to test how truelove powerful an item will be in the context of a big tournament.  An example of this is the storm flip.  In pubs the item was just an annoyance for the majority of the time with it not being used in the late game circles due to pub matches ending in much earlier zone stages than comp games.  However when the item was used in competitive... we all know how that went down.  


The second and in my opinion the far better option is to have a test server similar to Overwatch's PTR.  This would allow for more thorough testing of the item than what is possible with the first option I mentioned.  The positive of this idea is that the new item is separated from live servers and is able to be tested in competitive contexts with arena games/customs able to be played on the test server.  Also say after 30 minutes in the test server the user is presented with a survey asking about their opinion on the new change and a rating out of 5, similar to the survey system we have now.  


Obviously there are more ideas and options available but these are the two I had on the top of my head and I didn't want to make this too long.",FortniteCompetitive

One thing I noticed, Combat is not available to everybody, and whoever has it has the dominance apparently.

Why? Well mostly because it's rarity is Blue/Epic/Legendary - and people and players go for chests, but in chests they find things such as - Gray Burst SMG, Gray AR, Gray AK, Infantry Rifle, Scoped AR and such.

So that means whoever gets "" lucky "" enough to find the Combat has a huge advantage over people who find  bad weapons in chests (Chests are supposed to give you good stuff, eh?)

Anyways, players in Squads especially don't have the chance to fight at same terms, like before - when atleast everybody had Pumps and you could show that you were really better or atleast more used to this game.

Now I feel that, despite the fact good players are out there - having a Gray Tac vs Combat can sometimes pull you out when you are 1v1 against people - so Solos are fine so far, but in Squads? If atleast 2 guys have Combat, and you are in the middle of the fight, you can maybe get one down, but the next hit you will be taken down by another Combat user.

It doesn't feel right - I have been on the winning and losing end and I see people just being unable to counter Combat at all, all they have/had is maybe a Tac, and I just get the HG and shoot 10 pellets at the guy without any problems.

Why? Well we are not fighting on equal terms - I have the Combat, he doesn't. Combat is Blue rarity, Tac also has blue, which one prevails? Combat - always, even against the drum gun.


So for all those people out there playing squads, I kinda feel bad, you just have no space/time/loot/material/weapons/HP to counter Fast Paced Mobility players barging in on you after a fight/or even during. Guess that was the reason Siphon existed..

So maybe the fix for Combat Aggro is by making it only Legendary? Like Heavy Shotgun back in the day? Think it would be such a huge difference when people are fighting at the same terms.",FortniteCompetitive

Since Arena came out I only really played arena duos, me and my partner played really well and got up to 270+ points. Since then, we have been stuck in division 6. I always think of going into arena and trying to get a couple of good games and get more points, but I die of spawn a few times and stop playing solos for the rest of the day because mainly I guess you could say that I am 'scared' of solos. Even though it seems I am scared, whenever I am talking to someone whilst playing solos I tend to do better.

2) **Console would not have it, since Console can't handle it.**

A: That's what i've always said; Epic should just give everyone *OPTIONS.* Console could handle easely an Higher Fov it they could turn off Shadows, lower textures and every other option PC has.

3) **People would suffer from Motion Sickness.**

A: Players already suffer from the actual Fov, and the name says it all: ***SLIDER.*** You slide right for more, you slide left for less. And you could put it exactly the way you want. Kind of magical, ins't it?

4) **Lower budget PC's wouldn't handle it.**

A: If Low Budget PC players play the way it is now, they could just leave it the way it is or decrease other options to compensate for it.

5) **Streamers/commentators would lose viewer's if Fov was higher.**

A: Well, that depend's on Epic Replay/Spectator mode being improved. And yet, competitions use spectator mode that is complete thrash, and takes away all of the game flow (Being the laggyest thing ever).

I think those are all argument's against an Fov slider not being in the game. So, since none of them are actually GOOD, i see no reason for everyone to suffer from the lack of it.

Feel free to put some other arguments or to commentate on the ones above. Let's make it really clear to Epic that this is now the most important matter for the game right now.",FortniteCompetitive

I WANT to play Fortnite when Epic makes the game better,"Before the last patch, I had basically zero motivation to play the game. The new horde mode means nothing to me, pubs are boring and slow, and I'm not gonna lie, I get shit on most of the time in Div 6 Arena if I try to stomp the lobby

The previous updates didn't do anything for me. Nothing really exciting or sparked my interest. But then 9.30 came along and I genuinely was excited to play the game when I got home from work

The boom bow vaulting made me insanely happy. It was OP and it needed to be vaulted, don't need to elaborate too much. I think that the majority of us hated the bow, unless we're the one using it

The addition of the chug splash was really good in my opinion. They're good in solos, but obviously are most effective in squads. I mean, how could any person complain about the addition of another form of shield. The increase to the shield spawn rate last patch was a good move, but this addition of the chug splash was really great in my mind

The removal of shotgun delay was absolutely my favorite change. It made the ""Tfue classic"" much more useful and powerful, as well as made shotguns feel smoother and less clunky. We've been wanting this done for a while, so this is definitely a W for everyone that asked for this.

I appreciate when Epic makes good changes and makes the game more enjoyable. Regardless of how angry this game makes me, or how much I hate on it, it's still my favorite game, so I like when there are changes that make Fortnite more playable for me

HOPEFULLY, this update is the start of a string of good updates, so I'm going to try to stay optimistic and hope that Epic keeps this momentum going",FortniteCompetitive

I've been playing Fortnite since season 2 and I've never been so frustrated with the game as I was yesterday. I was excited to play with the new chug splash item and some nice QOL changes to the game. But game after game was only getting more and more triggered. I probably played 10 games or so and only picked up a combat shotgun once. And me as well as my duo partner seemed to have died to a team with combats every game. It became quite comical at a certain point because we were looting entire POIs to ourselves and getting gray tacs only. The shotgun meta really needs to be addressed before I lose my gd mind. I dont want to stop playing, I love the game and I want it to get better but like I said... what the hell are you doing? You must realize the combat is just a better tac and lowering the combat drop chance only made whoever find one early game an actual God. You have to outplay someone incredibly if you have a tac and they have a combat. At least when the pump was in the game, yeah, you could 1 pump someone but the fire rate of the tac contrasted well if you didn't have the best of aim. Now it's all just screwed up

In case you didn’t know Asia has two subregions :-

1) Singapore (30 ping) 2) Tokyo (140+ ping)

Before this patch we’d always get Singapore servers in customs, but ever since yesterday’s patch we’ve been getting Tokyo server every time!

Customs were the only way we could enjoy the game till Middle East server comes out and they take it away from us as well. We’ve never played arena below a 140 ping and customs are the only way to have a taste of the competitive feel with good ping. We were happy with it cause we had to adjust and popular fortnitecomp term ADAPT. BUT FOR WHAT?

Now they suddenly remove SG server from customs; we reached out to one of the employees and he claims Singapore database doesn’t have the hardware to hold customs which is completely untrue as we have been practising on the Sg server for months :( 

Please stop lying Epic and give us our Sg server back on customs, that’s the least you can do for us, let us enjoy the beast of a game you’ve created!!",FortniteCompetitive

However, I think the idea of burst weapons in a game so heavily based on bloom is just retarded. With the Famas and the Burst Rifle you at least had FSA. Which does not compensate for the fact the the other 2 rounds went to mars. 
With the new burst smg things are even worse. Of course you can lucky headshot ding an opponent on close range. But I don't want to rely on even more randomness as we already have.

In conclusion I think the burst mechanic and bloom don't complement each other and epic should get over the burst weapons.

I like the tactical shotgun, whenever i had a gold pump and got geganked by a guy with a blue tac shotty, i would always be astonished, how on earth did i get melted by an autoshotty? I think it's a gun that takes a lot of skill and patience to get kills with. Because even if you spam the gun, you'll only be hitting fat 20 damage body shots with bad aim and positioning

But now we have the combat, the Musket of Doom as i like to call it. It has a more consistent fire rate and spread compared to the tac shotgun, making the tac become obsolete, and i really don't want to see the tac go, so i was wondering if there were any possible buffs that could make the tac viable without becoming a whole different weapon

I have an idea for a decent tac buff

Make the rarity go back to being green/blue/purple

Increase the fire rate

Make the damage be 80/83/86 Body Damage and 160/166/172 Headshot Damage

Decrease The Range, this thing should be unviable if shot from 3 tiles away or further, and only be efficient at 2 tiles away or closer

Increase the Pellet Spread Gradually when the gun is being fired rapidly (Rhyming Accidentally)

And decrease the Ammo Count to 6

These changes would make me want to pick up a tac over a Combat Shotgun, but i can understand complaints about such a high dps for the tac, but if you disagree with these changes, lmk why and what you would do to buff the tac

This isn't a post about whining because ""gaem bad and combat op"". I just want to help make the game feel a bit more balanced and enjoyable for those who are a big fan of weapon metas and tier lists",FortniteCompetitive

Numerically this seems ambivalent, but think about it. Does a casual or even an average player want to play ONE-HUNDRED games for a single win, one hundred games to feel rewarded? Nope. LTMs are generally hollow at best, limited by their lifespan in the rotation or hamstrung by the BR mechanics. They keep casuals entertained but the more resident player base should see them as beta tests for future game modes, the beginning of a more fleshed out play list or objective based play like Halo or Counterstrike. These two games are what Epic should be gunning for, a deceptive skill gap that doesn't always manifest itself because you can just respawn next round to try again, and not have wasted 20 minutes harvesting mats to get bodied by some sweat who was clearly better than you. BR is PUNISHING. It has always been. Fortnite may have gotten around that with it's innocent, quirky, innovative mechanics but those traits are gone, banished to Season 2 nostalgia. We're all searching for something that's dead, casuals and sweats alike.

Why this is the solution:

1.) Non-creative warriors have an opportunity to play and get better organically, similar to other games. No, it won't turn Timmy into Sway, but he doesn't have to be. He just has to not feel like Timmy in a way that doesn't neuter Sway.

2.) Improved skill based matchmaking. BR has so much RNG, the ranking in Arena couldn't possibly keep the more nuanced distinctions between average and above average players separate. This improves on point one as well.

3.) With challenging yet non-punishing/tiring game modes, the temptation to smurf won't be there.

4.) Opens up newer play styles without compromising the native game mechanics. Fortnite will always be dominated by building and shotguns, but Epic can tweak game modes inherently to adjust this, rather than releasing game breaking patches or weapons. 

4.) Vehicles will now be an opportunity for fun and tactics, not troll utilities or vessels for lesser players to get easier placement points. 

5.) Extending the life of the game! We've all spent a lot of money on this live service game, it's time to transition to a more rotational/traditional kind of game. This won't break Epic's revenue at all, if anything it may improve. It just adds more variety and stability to the future of this franchise.

I think people already realize this in the popularity of zone wars. I'd love to see small team battles, 1v1s, CTF, and other game modes added to the game. The possibilities are limitless! 

The future of Fortnite isn't BR, BR is a fad. It's the building mechanic, and all of the possibilities that come with it. Epic has just scratched the surface, and while today's patch gave me hope for the games future, it's these possibilities that keep me playing.",FortniteCompetitive

On console I used to play on my TV sitting on my couch and It felt completely normal.
But now that I sit in front of a monitor I feel like I'm trapped and Is so bad.
I think that PC Players REALLY needs an FOV slider, I think that in this game it is so important and it will give an huge upgrade to the overall experience of Fortnite.
The default FOV of this game makes it kinda unplayable in some situations.
I'm not the only one who is struggling with this FOV, a lot of PC players used to play with custom resolutions that were useful to increase the FOV, after the removal of those resolution a lot of  players (pros and casuals) left the game and you haven't done anything about it. 
An FOV slider will not affect the quality of the game so content creators will be able to bring their content with the FOV they want, without any repercussion on the viewing experience of the spectators. 
It will increase the complessive happiness of the community and it will bring back a lot of players. 
Please Epic think about it, we NEED it.

- It fills your inventory, so when you want nades for example in slot 4, you just swap it with the weapon in that slot. If you only have 2 weapons in your inventory (because you didn't manually pick up the 2 burst smgs you found in your first house), your grenades will slip into slot 3, costing you (little) time to rearrange them. It's very useful in early game to quickly fill up your inventory because if you have 3 shit guns and pick up a shotgun, it will go to the 4th slot.

It’s no wonder than when it was taken away fortnite’s player base started to dwindle and migrate to other BRs. 

This is something I hope to see in the next patch and I hope all of you will rally behind me and work to fix fortnite for good. Get your @ locked and loaded, practice your battlecries, and head to twitter boys. GG",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

This week was a brilliant surprise, shotgun delay removed (this is probably the main thing out of everything i would ask for) along with the bow (probably due to the backlash of it being removed from rumble but not pubs or arena) and dynamite vaulted.

&amp;#x200B;

We also had only 1 item added and it was a heal, which is fantastic, but with 3 items vaulted and only one added this automatically helps with the loot pool and finding less desirable loot....

&amp;#x200B;

So thanks for listening Epic, i also think the new shotgun coming could be good but only if it replaces the tac... 

&amp;#x200B;

So credit where it is due, well done Epic games.

They deal 10 damage per tick and the ticks start as soon as it hits, so you will always take atleast 10 damage. Not only that but they force you to move (Which means the opponent could get a shot off and you waste mats).

You realize how fucking happy players are if you listen to them? Shotgun delay is the best example. After all bad patches, people are still freaking out in the comments right now! No one here wants to complain just to complain. The people love this game!

The new item is probably something we all enjoy - this is the kind of items we want to see. Small adjustments to lacks in the loot pool - not game breaking weapons.

Am i right thinking we will find a combat more often now? Especially dualies were everywhere on the floor loot so the combat will probably step into their place for some times?

I like especially how many small bugs were fixed: right direction!

I am 12 years of age and I enjoy Fortnite tremendously. I also like to spend my maternal parent's money to purchase V-Bucks regularly. Unfortunately, I struggle with building and want to be as fast as my favorite Fortnite streamers such as Ninja, Tfue, and DrLupo. I feel as if I cannot build fast because of the 0.15s build delay that is currently in the game (ex.  [https://streamable.com/7k33a](https://streamable.com/7k33a) ). It is simply too slow for my hyperactive developing brain. This disability greatly discourages me from purchasing in-game cosmetic items such as the funny Fishstick and the marvelous Brite Bomber. I would just like to ask for a removal of the build delay which I believe would increase my overall enjoyment of the game, unlock more potential, and help me feel the satisfaction of winning a game with a bit of good fortune. I usually celebrate winning games by purchasing more items.

Thanks in advance,

Timothy Little",FortniteCompetitive

Idk it's just pathetic, like after clutching up and just getting two or three kills while rotating in storm and being out of mats, and all you are trying to do is pop some minis and ballers see that and just start ramming your shit, but they don't jump out they leave all the other players to do the work.

We also feel this is important in Team Rumble specifically because we feel that players should not be forced to be taken out of the game for a few seconds while they respawn and glide down just because of unfair deaths.**",FortniteCompetitive

Quicker edits are flooding the Fortnite Professional Scene, and really started to get me thinking, *Is faster edits more skillful then powerful edits*? I might get bombarded with disagreement, but I want to state something. Raider464 is the fastest editor, not the best editor. Yes, as time goes on, powerful edits get faster, but it's almost unnecessary to edit in the style that Raider does. To me, he shouldn't be known for flying through edits; I think he should be known for combining those quick edits with incredible building, precise aiming, sensational smarts, and an endless imagination. I think of Raider like the Japanese in WWII. Japan would fly through countries at unbelievable speeds, leaving the ones on the opposite end completely invulnerable and prone to collapse. It wasn't until the United States, a **powerful** nation, stepped in after Pearl Harbor. America used it's practically unlimited supplies and troops to push the Japanese back with fury, not speed. America was successfully able to push the Japanese back to their mainland, and dropped the two atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Raider is Japan, and \*insert powerful player\* is America. Raider has a good streak, but if \*powerful player\* unleashes their fury, Raider will begin to collapse. Speed isn't a need, it is impressive to have, especially the speed Raider has, but it simply can't compete with players who can unleash more fury then others. Once a powerful player rushes onto the scene, Raider won't be able to keep up. I hope you agree with me, and if this post goes well, I will write more.

Sincerely,

TFS Ant",FortniteCompetitive

The benefit of using claw is the jump shot and the extra bind possibilities, but I'm not sure if it would outweigh the possibilities of arthritis or carpal down the line :/

Some other things to consider:
•I'm too broke to buy a controller with paddles
•I don't want to play mouse and keyboard
•I'm average at best at fortnite but I want to get into competitive

These guys do unreal stuff with their aim/flicks/edits that can only be properly viewed in real time. You lose appreciation for their precision when you watch through spectator mode. 

If they do spectator mode for the biggest tourney basically ever in esports I will be massively disappointed. And honestly I won't even watch other than check in to see standings. Watching first person Tfue trying to qualify is some of the best videogame drama ive ever seen. Now they gonna take that away from us at the real event. Really hope I am wrong here.

After world cup, I'd like to see a few different ideas tested in pop up cups.
These ideas are:
- *Mobility disabled after 2nd/3rd zone.* After 2nd/3rd zone, it is not far between each zone. There should be no free rotations from this point on as the main point of mobility was to help players reach safe zone if the first circle landed opposite side of the map. This could be announced similar to storm surge, with text appearing notifying players that vehicles would self-destruct
- *A competitive loot pool.* This could be simply tested by disabling certain weapons/consumables in each cup, choosing it based off the opinions of the top 3000 players who participated in all of the pop up cups. 
- *Try 3 rounds of qualifiers instead of 2.* Not sure whether this would be on Friday, Saturday, Sunday or what schedule would suit but the point of it would be to find a time which suits best.

There's probably more that could be done to improve competitive fortnite, but these are the 3 main points I'd like to see epic follow after week 10.",FortniteCompetitive

On the other hand, 3rd partying has never been in a worse state.

 I literally can't even fight a guy for more than 45 seconds before someone flies on top of my builds and tries to just complicate things. It's horrible. I reckon I'm a decent player but sometimes my fights go on for a long time. And therefore before I can even kill anyone, boom someone land right on my head and just spams their combat.

What makes 3rd partying even worse is that you can still 3rd party from hundreds of meters away thanks to how good the snipers are. The heavy pretty much insta kills someone if you hit them. The boom bow doesn't even need to hit your target for it to do damage. And the quick fire rate of the semi is annoying enough to make you box up in a 1v1 even if some bot is spamming the semi auto from 200m away. The fact that a silent sniper is the most balanced sniper in  the game tells you a lot about how overpowered the current snipers are. The fact that a sniper that literally makes no noise, is a better sniper than the other 3 makes you think how crazy the other snipers are.

In late game pubs everyone carries a sniper and I've died to 4 snipers in the 8 games that I played today. It's disgusting. I literally 3rd partied someone and got a kill with my boombow from 223m away today! 223m! I've never felt so bad for getting a kill in my life. 

This season has made 3rd partying so easy through mobility everywhere on the map, and overpowered snipers being able to effectively 3rd party from 200m away. Please bring back a classic mode. The mobility is too much and the third partying is ridiculous in this game.",FortniteCompetitive

I think it gives a different take on this situation.

Im someone who uses Kovaaks a lot, so Im used to having a small, static, sort of thick, easy to see reticle. I can use the combat and pump shotguns extremely well and hit most of my shots with them, but when it comes to the tac, the giant reticle completely throws me off, and I end up missing a ton. My eyesight isnt the best, and I can barely see the tiny dot in the center, and I definitely cant do this when I have a few milliseconds to move the reticle to the target. Not being able to properly see the center makes it seem like Im trying to align the center of a box that is 4 times the size of the target (a player head), with the center of the target. Basically I cant tell exactly when its aligned, and I end up missing a lot.

A very easy fix for this would be custom reticles (as probably a million others have already suggested). I personally think we should be able to change the center dot to something else. I would want a static “+” sign that we can change the thickness and color on. The “bloom bars” should be really light color, as I dont even use them to aim at all, but rather to see if I have first shot accuracy or not.

As a company that has added plenty of accessibility features, and has even taken the “extra measures” to “prevent motion sickness”, I think that this should be added as well. Everyone’s eyesight is different, and not everyone can use the default reticles. I would even be willing to pay for it. I dont even care at this point. Im just that tired of the reticles.

TL;DR The center dot is too small, and with my bad eyesight, it makes guns such as the tac terrible for me. Custom reticles are needed imo.",FortniteCompetitive

Most times it is super slow and delayed where my character feels heavy and i have to literally put more force into my joysticks in order to get my character to do what I want. It is basically like a bad input delay.

Sometimes within the same game my sensitivity will be extremely slow and then mid building it turns super fast and its just so inconsistent.

If the game reverted back to season 4 (with a few tweaks) it would finally feel fun again!

Also I think the only vehicle in the game should be the ATK as it was mobility that offered decently fast travel speed in exchange for vulnerability. 

Season 4 was a good time :)",FortniteCompetitive

Is it easy to use? What's missing? Any bugs or data problems?

Note that we haven't done anything to tailor it to mobile - it works, but it is very small.

 If it has potential, does anyone know how we can reach out to Epic for access to more data?

497,Advent_7,1560722019,c1fhe7,15,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/c1fhe7/can_someone_explain_differences_in_fps/,3,Can someone explain differences in fps?,I play console so I've only experienced fortnite in 60 fps.  Everyone always talks about it being such an advantage to have more frames.  I know there are things like more bullets coming out per unit time and increased aim assist on controllers but what is it about having so many more frames that makes much of a difference?  Can you see everything when you're whipping the camera around at high sensitivity or what??,FortniteCompetitive
498,BurnedInTheBarn,1560720444,c1f70x,13,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/c1f70x/hotspots_need_to_change/,4,Hotspots need to change.,"The point of Hotspots is so that there is one or more places on the map that have good loot and are a player magnet for people wanting high kill games. But Hotspots are incredibly flawed and aren't really worth landing at. The first problem is that to shoot the drones, you have to expose yourself to enemies. When you are shooting, it's hard to hear other sounds so someone can sneak up behind you and bop you in the head. The second problem is that they don't drop heals or other  useful items like Rifts and Shadow Bombs which limits their use later in the game. The third problem is that they are a pain to retrieve as in some areas like Sunny Steps where the drones can get caught in a tree and cannot be shot easily. My solution to this is that the drones are removed, all chests and floor loot spawns are guaranteed like TR and all weapons from chests and floor loot in the hotspot are blue or above and chests drop 2 utility items/heals, double ammo and double mats (60).",FortniteCompetitive

Here's some history for new players...

A long time ago the God Daequan introduced us to the double pump, a strategy that employed switching between two pumps effectively shortening the delay between shots. After a while, epic removed the semi auto one shots of double pump and made the game more balanced. 

However... Double pump came back, as well as double heavies and pump tac etc. And it was here for a long time, hiding under epic's radar. But when time came for a solution, epic didn't remove double shotguns, they removed one shots and reduced headshot multipliers. This kept shotgun meta around, and everyone needed two shotguns to survive. And now, season 5, they add a delay to eradicate double shotties  forever. We are now stuck with one shotgun, doing 147 damage maximum. And this is where I come in.

Epic made a mistake keeping double shotties, but the bigger mistake was nerfing their damage. So the solution is simple... Bring back headshot multipliers that can one shot people with full shield. Here are some reasons why. 


Reduces luck based fights: Let's say you Loot the entirety of tilted yet come out with no shield and 75 health. As you leave you run into a noob with 200 health, and you hit a headshot for 147 with a pump, just to be hit by a LMG spam and die. Do you deserve to win? Yeah. Do you win? No. This rewards better players and allows for low health people to have a chance.

Clutching up/solo squads: When you are playing against 4 people with a tactical shotgun each, even if you have full health they must hit enough before you can kill all four to kill you. With one pumps, you could kill one easily and keep going based on skill entirety. Many streamers solo squading earlier don't anymore because it is very difficult when you run into semi decent players with shotties. 

That good feeling: Does everyone remember that feeling when you hit a 200 damage headshot through shield with a pump? It was amazing. Alas... Unless they bring back the one pump, that feeling is no more. Thanks!

TLDR: Bringing headshot multipliers up brings the game to a balance, like all things should be, and benefits skilled players.

    This means if you are not constantly observing every wall you build then the shooter can get at least 50 damage before you have a chance to place another one. This is not fun to play against and kind of unfair. Seeing all of your buildings just suddenly die without notice is unrealistic in games nowadays and the wall should make the classic breaking noise rather than just quietly disappear.",FortNiteBR

I saw the responses on the Ragnorak color concept, and many people were opposed to the win challenge, because it is, supposedly, too difficult. I understand that many people with different skill levels play this game, but there is just no incentive to winning and/or high kill games. Also, after a certain amount of wins, the player seems to lose his/her enthusiasm for Victory Royales. I believe that by creating certain “difficult” challenges, players will get rewarded for winning, and the Season 3 issue, where millions of John Wicks were running around, will not happen again.

This literally modifies how you adjust your analogue sticks to where you precisely want to aim. Unlike KB+M players, we don’t use our WHOLE arm just to aim, we use our thumbs which makes it harder for us as well as having aim assist, gives us slight help but not as good as what KB+M players have with their DPI setting too. According to the research of data miners, I believe the natural dead zone setting is about 27% which creates a slight rift towards our aiming. This means it impacts our play style as some competitive players prefer to play on 10% or perhaps below (like me). I really think EPIC needs to implement these settings to adjust our aiming, giving us the max potential for our play style. Having a sensitivity slider is DEFINITELY not enough because I really can’t find the perfect setting, it’s either too fast or too slow, perfect setting on console doesn’t exist (yet).  They SERIOUSLY need to pay attention to our posts more as this will MASSIVELY benefit the game, I feel like this topic has been ignored rather than looked into (as there are DOZENS of posts about it). They would prefer to listen to someone like Ninja as he is one of the “biggest streamer” to EPIC coz they wanna make their game look good. If you REALLY wanna be a better console player, this post (or a post regarding to this topic) must be spread around more! PUBG has these settings so why doesn’t fortnite have any of these settings? 
Dead-zone, aim acceleration etc. 
Is it really that hard to implement these settings to fortnite? 
What do you guys think? 
I personally think it’s an amazing idea as EPIC has NO excuse to not implement these settings. ",FortNiteBR

I stopped for a minute and started to rethink strategy a little.

I have came to this:

1) Play Solo - Its faster, and teammates wont steal it from you.

2) Llamas are often on hills or on the top of the trees. Searching hills takes more time, so go for top of the trees.

3) Use change that came in update 5.0.0 - If you destroy tree, llama will fall on the ground without breaking (same goes for all object holding it)

4) Head to Wailing Woods forrest - There are lot of trees, and since map has changed, there are only few players going there. Use glider so you could fly from begging of forrest to the end. Open it in proper height, so you could see the llama, but not too far (since view distance limit could hide it from you). 

After few games I finally got it. GOOD LUCK TO ALL!",FortNiteBR

There's not really much for those who dedicate more time to it, yes its about having fun but just about every game has a way to reward those who dedicate more time to them. 

For example: Runescape you would get a cape after reaching max level in a skill. (Took roughly 2 months of play time to get). I don't remember anyone complaining about it either. If you think it's not worth your time then I think that's all the reason to not want it.

I personally dislike this change but that isn't the point and I can understand why so many people like the change.

What I request is somewhat of a compromise. Since there is no real challenge in getting fully-upgraded anymore and everyone, both bad, decent and good players will all look the same, why not add different colours (similar to Omega) but with a series of real challenges to unlock them.

For example:

Getting 20 wins using Ragnarok unlocks a golden/yellow colour.
Getting 1000 kills using Ragnarok unlocks a red colour.
Unlocking Ragnarok within Season 5 unlocks a purple colour.

I think these challenges would be great as only the top 5% or so of players will be able to complete them besides maybe the last one. We need some form of a challenge now as there isn't any in the game.

- Playing this game as a casual shooter is impossible as their is an abundance of players who take this game way too seriously and use the most cheese strategy’s. 

- Building in this game is overused to the point where you could get someone to the point of being low and they could just spam their way out of getting killed allowing them to heal while you have wasted heaps of bullets trying to kill them.

- The game is extremely repetitive

- Levelling up takes way too long

-vbucks are overpriced, like seriously 30-40 bucks for 1 skin? It’s a free game and all I get that but come on.

1. Fortnite has made it a point of incorporating popular culture into the game (John Wick, Hype Emote, Floss Emote, and countless others), and who is a more important figure in popular culture than Steve Buscemi?
2. He was in a movie called The Island, which was about an island that was not what it seemed, sound familiar.
3. Steve Buscemi was in the movie Grown-Ups, which was all about worlds colliding, and different time periods coming together. The movie explored intergenerational relationships, and examines parents **worlds colliding** with their children's. The movie also sees different time periods coming together, sound a little bit like season 5?
4. He was also in a movie called On the Road, hence the name, Road Trip Challenge
5. Steve Buscemi has never publicly denied that he is an avid fortnite player, and that he has been in talks with epic games about a custom skin.
6. If you rearrange the letters of ""Steve Buscemi"", add a few letters, then take a few letters away, it spells fortnite battle Royale, coincidence I think not.",FortNiteBR

**Hey everyone,**

*First of all I want to say this is my experience, It might work fine for you, But I suggest not downloading it as of right now.*

When you update to version 18.7.1 there is a chance that you'll have some bugs which won't let you into the game and or crash or PC, The bug that occurred to me is the UE4-FortniteGame Crash, where it just won't launch the game, Sometimes it will freeze your PC and you'll have to restart and sometimes AMD will recover itself. In short - It wont let you into the game (at least it was like that for me).

So this is not a tutorial or anything but if you did update, I'd suggest downgrading until there's a stable version, How do you do that? You need to download DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller) There are millions on tutorials on Youtube just use them, (DoN't FoRgEt TO BE IN SAFE MODE), then you can download the old drivers from AMD'S website. I'd suggest reporting that bug to AMD.",FortNiteBR

The Samurai (bottom left), Ra (top left), Mysterious Hooded Figure (top right), and Loki (bottom right).  Here's why:


Yesterday, I posted my [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8yi5jt/theory_worlds_collide_progressive_map_changes/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link) that as the season progresses, so will the map through the expansion of the snowy biome, the desert, and the introduction of more historical monuments and cultures.  Although I still believe this theory is plausible, and that reading it would help you to better understand this post, I'm lead to believe that there is going to be some sort of big twist partway through the season. If not I at least expect the plot to evolve in ways to keep people on their toes. Right now, I believe there are two main ways Epic could alter the plot:

First, with more map changes in addition to what we currently see.

-There is already a lot we know about the map changes that I've already touched on [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8yi5jt/theory_worlds_collide_progressive_map_changes/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link), however further possibilities include: 

* The Desert and Golf course

* The Norse Viking Village

* Polynesian (Easter Island Heads)

* Egyptian (Loot lake Pyramid)

* Japanese (Drifts Kitsune mask and Jacket, Lucky Landing)


Second, with the Road Trip Skin and the 7th loading screen.

-Epic provided us with this sillouette of the Roadtrip skin which would usually be worthless, but in this case the skin has a very distinct shape.

So who exactly is behind the mask?

**Theory #1 - [Drift's Mentor, a Shogun Samurai](https://imgur.com/R3UWMv9)**

I'm lead to believe this because Drift's powers seem to be focused more on Japanese culture than other cultures. I recently thought he would gather his powers from many cultures rather than one, but it seems like he  is going to get most of them from one place. But who would have that kind of power? A Shogun Samurai. I'm lead to believe this because Drift's powers seem to be focused more on Japanese culture than other cultures. The mask he wears is a Japanese Kitsune mask and his coat has a glowing Japanese Character on it. I recently thought he would gather his powers from many cultures rather than one, but it seems like he is going to get most of them from one place. But who would have that kind of power? A Shogun Samurai.

**Theory #2 - [Ra, the Egyptian Sun God](https://imgur.com/bY2blOp)**

Like the samurai, Re's and body shape are a strong potential match to the sillouette. There are multiple roles that Ra could play in the plot for this season:
1) Drift, who everyone expected to be the hero, chickens out and uses the rift edge to escape rather than fix the map (big twist right?). As a result, someone else needs to bear the torch. As previously stated, the Viking area will expand eventually leading to a war between sun and snow. What better mascot to defeat Ragnarok than the sun god himself?
2) Secretly the real villain. While everyone is against the Vikings, Ra will secretly be using Drift to his advantage to get rid of the maps snow (another big twist right?).

However, these both have a small problem: The overall pointy-ness of the top of the figure's head.

This is more of a problem for Ra than the samurai, because Samurai traditionally have horns on their helmets (note the fire on the one above's helmet). But I don't see this posing much of a problem considering Epic will likely manipulate the designs any way they desire to make them unique.

This also opens up a new possibility, his head is uneven, meaning he could potentially have non-solid headgear.

This leads me to...


**Theory #3 - [Mysterious Hooded Figure](https://imgur.com/oenY9Uh)**

This figure would likely be some sort of true villain behind the scenes (probably not a good guy) and someone who is revealed as being behind Ragnarok's actions.


However, who would that possibly be? I did say that The nine months of winter was only the FIRST STEP of Ragnarok didn't I? (I did in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8yi5jt/theory_worlds_collide_progressive_map_changes/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)). Well the rest of the events are caused by a certain man. Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the true villain of Ragnarok. The one! The only! The man himself! I present to you: 

**Theory #4 - [Loki](https://imgur.com/uIkRFp6)**

According to Norse mythology, Loki was eternally imprisoned in his last myth. It is said he will remain there until Ragnarok occurs, then he will be able to escape and kill all the Gods and destroy the world and whatnot
I think it's totally viable that they make him the road trip skin, but give him a black hood and a nickname such as ""The Trickster.""

Out of all of these, I see the samurai being one of the more likely ones because of the armor plates on the silluoette.


**TL;DR: The road trip skin will likely be a Samurai, Ra, Mysterious Hooded Figure, or Loki.**

So I really don’t see the point of progressive skins if you are able to unlock the upgrades after the season is over. This is because it doesn’t show you who actually grinded for the reward of upgrading the skin. We all complained how we wanted something that would distinguish the people who actually play and grind a lot from the people who just buy everything. In s4 we got that with the omega lights, but now the people who really grind and play consistently will get the fully unlocked s5 skins, but also every other player who has a battle pass will get them too, just at a later time. For me it just makes everyone the same again and doesn’t distinguish the people who grind from the people who don’t. ",FortNiteBR

Also, players can now simply destroy nearly everything you built with one rocket or c4. By nerfing shotguns and buffing explosives, Epic is giving the terrible players who do not know how to build a chance to kill the more skilled players who are able to build. To add on to this disgust, Epic has also buffed cqb automatic weapons to further lower the skill gap between good and bad players.

I personally believe that core mechanics and skill based features such as Building and the recent double pump nerf should not be removed especially after the old players like myself have gotten used to over the past 10 months or so. I realize this is a business, but abandoning your old player base in order to attract new players and pandering to casual players after this recent season 5 was the end of the line for me. I've tried to keep playing the past few days but it isn't enjoyable as the time and practice I've put into this game is essentially useless since there's almost no skill gap now. This isn't a witch-hunt or a f-you to Epic, I thought it'd be best to post here and articulate the exact reasons behind why I'm quitting this game. I hope Epic Games can reverse some of these changes down the line as I don't want this to become H1Z1 2.0... I made a small list of things that I believe have caused Fortnite to be driven to the ground for players like myself who've relied on mainly skill-based mechanics within the game to be better than others.. 

1. Explosives

(C4, Grenades, Grenade Launcher, RPG) Extremely overpowered, 2 C4s can essentially level a whole building. I can't stress enough the amount of times I've died when I've made it to the end killing a lot of people to just get blown up with C4 by a noob. All those explosives are a counter to building, building is skill based and it takes practise to become a good builder. Now, it makes no sense because you have a non-skill based counter to a skilled based feature like building. As a player who puts in time to become skilled at the game, I can easily be killed by a noob who plays casually.

2) Shotguns

Shotguns and building were a duo that originally attracted me and a bunch of other players initially to the game. Last night I tried playing after the update and I got one shot off before I got blown up by a C4. For a supposedly balanced game, Epic has nerfed skill based weapons and essentially made non-skill weapons extremely overpowered.

3) LMG/Minigun

Once again, another non-skill based counter to building. There's almost no counter to a minigun other than trying to get one sniper shot off hoping you don't miss, which is an extremely small chance when you can't build at the same time to protect against such a high fire-rate weapon. You can keep building to protect yourself from the minigun but at some point you'll end up running out of resources and you'll get pummelled by the minigun. The thing that baffles me is that epic wants to cap resources even more which'll be even harder to defend against such OP weapons.

4) Hunting Rifle/Sniper Rifle

The hunting rifle was my favourite weapon in the game. The feeling of hitting someone far away with a hunting rifle without a scope was an amazing feeling because you know it takes skill to hit those shots. Now, epic has changed the drop rate to be similar as of the sniper rifle. Now, the Sniper Rifle is a weapon that had it's own pro (Scoped, easier to aim), meanwhile the hunting rifle was more skill based and required you to hit a target without a scope, thus the drop rate seemed fair enough as both weapons were balanced. With the drop rate being equalized there's no difference, the Sniper Rifle is more superior and easier to use since it has a scope.

5) Editing

This may or may not effect some people but it did affect me. I relied on editing to the point where you could still see through with the edit option, it was integral since I'd been using it for a long time. Being able to track enemies around you especially at the end is necessary if you want to win. Not sure why epic really disabled that but my instinct tells me it was to ""level the playing-field""

I hope Epic Games comes up with a solution in which they're able to separate skill gap by inserting competitive modes within the game where we can have old mechanics back within the game. I understand it is essential for a business to attract new players but that could also be done with a separate friendly game mode where there's not much skill involved.",FortNiteBR

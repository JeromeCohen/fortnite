Then he just starts sending invite after invites, so I just joined to see what the problem was. I join the party, and this man who sounds like he's 30 just started getting all mad, and said I was a cheater for killing him in a video game. So he said ""well say goodbye to your account because your getting booted."" And I was trying to say why cause I was being more mature about trying to solve the problem, but he was saying like oh my aunt works at Microsoft and he's gonna get my IP address, blah blah blah you get the point. And I still was tryna to ask him what's the big deal, and just keep saying ""uh huh, ok, yup"" then he was like oh I'm getting your street address and I'm coming to kick your ass. Then at that point I was ""oh my it's just another mad dude getting salty or whatever"" so I thought nothing of it. But i wanted to share this and see what your opinions on it. If I do get booted offline would there be anyway of getting it back. I know it's a long post but just wanted to share. Thank you.

I've played Epic games since Jazz Jackrabbit (Spaz for life). I don't think the founders skins should be available to just anyone who now goes out and buys it, but only the ones who supported this game since the very start, or before a certain date. It just doesn't feel special now that it's open to anyone who goes out now and buys the founders edition, especially since they weren't on sale back in the beginning like they are now. It's a nice gesture. Just wish it didn't feel cheapened. Exclusivity isn't a bad thing, just like the Blue Bomber only coming from buying a fortnite edition PS4.

I don't know if  my arms are in the wrong position or anything I am just keeping it like how it feels comfortable. I physically cant get my ring finger to reach the number 1 and 2 key unless I take it off the shift button. I have pretty large hands as well so I really don't see what my problem is. I also don't really wanna change my weapon slot to anything on my mouse and any other letter keys as I use these for other stuff like building editing etc.I see all the streamers using the number keys to switch weapons and see them pressing the number 1 and 2 key while in a full sprint.

Even Myth switched to a new account with this same suspicion. Curious myself I planned on playing 10 games on my main account and 10 on a fresh account and track the statistics of the players in the lobby. Skip to the bottom for a TL:DR and the link halfway down is the in-depth statistics.

Background: I am a decent player, around a 4KD overall and around a 5-6KD in season 5. I have around 250 wins and play pretty frequently. The idea is, if there is SBMM the players in my lobbies will be of higher skill than if I played on a fresh account given that I have good stats. What I did was enter lobbies then leave and go into the replay and get as many names as I can from the player list. I put them all into a spreadsheet which will be linked further down (with the usernames redacted) and gathered the stats of each of them over the games.

I ended up doing only 3 games per account, but have the evidence continued to suggest SBMM by an extremely large margin I would have done all 10. If there is a large outcry for me to do this over a much larger sample size I would be happy to do so.

The results: On my main account the average K/D was around 0.98 and the average amount of wins was 37, on the new account the average K/D was 0.76 and the average amount of wins was 25. There were around 66 players on my main account that had a K/D above 1 and on the fresh account there were about 39 with a K/D above. There were 54 players on my main account with 0 wins while my fresh account had 70 players with 0 wins. The spreadsheet with the in-depth statistics is here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WoBCJDfmNmXKpX0VA53\_3tBYBfDNdqfatktq7ujYcNY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WoBCJDfmNmXKpX0VA53_3tBYBfDNdqfatktq7ujYcNY/edit#gid=0)

this includes Overall KD, S5 KD, Wins, and Win%, alongside my stats. I have a version that includes usernames as a way to prove these are legitimate stats.

While there are slight differences there isn't enough differentiation to claim that there is an form of SBMM, my games on my main account were still grouped with the same types of players that I was on my fresh account. I used Fortnitetracker for this and I know the flaws that come with that but this is the best I can do with the resources I have. 

TL:DR- Looked at the stats of a ton of people and there is not enough evidence to suggest SBMM, if there is a large outcry I will perform this test again over a much larger sample size as to add more legitimacy but i do not think the results will change. I hope this helps people come to the conclusion of whether or there is SBMM in this game. And a final note, huge shout out to my friend codfish who is responsible for all of the amazing work on formatting the spreadsheet and helping organize the spreadsheet. He also helped with a \*little\* of the work looking up players.

Since Epic have just announced the Founders Legendary (How are these legendary they don't deserve it.

You might also have heard that they might be getting free skins, a free glider, free backbling, info on where people drop most often and the locations of chests, basically Epic giving them what we never got. Once again, these are all rumors, and this might not be real. I can understand giving a free glider or backbling, although that would be rude to the community who has spent money on these things, they might do it. Another rumor is that they might be getting 950 V-Bucks for a free Battle Pass. All of this combined would give the Chinese community a head start into the game we love, and they might be handed what people have spent countless days tracking and discovering- what spots are most commonly dropped in, where chests are located, and most importantly the Victory Royale. If this is true, then it's not fair to the rest of us who put our time and energy into this game we love, the game that could possibly be turned into an unequal Battle Royale, where location is more important than your skills. Anyone notice that the only thing Xbox players only got STW skins, and that was a long time ago? Playstation is the only console that Epic has granted free stuff, time and time again. Have they ever cared when the cross play issue was first found? And now for one of my biggest issues- The complete ignorance of the PC community by the Fortnite devs. The PC players have been given nothing. They don't get anything special, STW or BR. The PC players have been here since day one, and they have been forgotten in favor of Playstation and Xbox.

I bought the game in the Xbox store, however I still see the option to purchase the Founders Edition, Limited Edition, Super Deluxe Edition and Standard Founders edition. I'm honestly just a little confused as to what the difference is and want to make sure I don't miss out on the new skins coming out. 

Anyone have any insight on the best way to tell what version you actually own on Console?

Was there just an edition called STW without being a founder? If the game is in Beta // Early Access (like all the Wallpapers say) shouldnt anyone who purchased the game before release be a ""Founder"" 

If I purchase the founders edition now will I just get the V bucks because I already own STW? 

So many questions, hoping for some good insight.

Apologies if this has been broght up before but I can't see anything after a quick search.

It looks like someone may have been using my account to play matches. if anyone can give any advice or advise if it is just a known bug that would be great. Details below:

1. When I log in the next day, progress has been made on daily / weekly challenges etc. In particular I noticed this as when I logged in yesterday I had completed a couple of the week 2 challenges but I hadn't played for a few days (since before they came out).

2. My loadout changes to a specific set, including skins + emotes overnight (even banner Icon has changed), it is usually on random apart from Drift as my skin.

3. I turned on 2 factor Authentification and changed my password but this ""person"" was still able to play on my account last night / earlier today.

4. gamertags / player names that I dont know appear on my lobby screen to invite to game.

5. As far as I Can see they are just playing, not purchasing anything.

6. I'm on Xbox one, not logged into any other consol + not shared my passwords etc with anyone.

1. Although I was a HUGE supporter and ""utilizer"" of the double pump and thought it was unjust to remove it...I have come to love the change. Shotguns are now a high risk/high reward weapon class, rewarding those who consistently land (head)shots with a large weapon clip and the capabilities to down multiple enemies in one clip. Adversely, SMG's are extremely low risk, but low(er) reward in the sense that it takes a large majority of 1 clip to down a single opponent, forcing you to reload while dealing with your second (third, and fourth) target. This makes dueling multiple people very challenging with the SMG. I think this is perfectly balanced...they have different strengths that support different playstyles.

2. Rifts/portals are fucking AWESOME and allow you to land on the edges of the map without the feeling you are going to be running the rest of the match to the circle in the opposite corner.

3. ATK's are simply a fun addition to the game...period. 

4.  Finally a relief valve to the 30+ people that used to land in Tilted every game, Paradise Palms. One of my biggest ""problems"" with this game was Tilted did just that...tilted the game. The first couple minutes of the round were very fun, followed by 10+ minutes of running around, looting and farming with hopes to find someone to kill. Now with Paradise Palms and other added POI's, people are landing in a variety of places and the games feel more exciting from start to finish.

5. Explosives are in a healthy state and allow for different dueling strategies. Before, when materials flowed like the salmon of Capistrano and explosives only had the capabilities to destroy 1 wall/ramp at a time...the only way to counter building was ...building. It was inefficient to try to destroy their structures and would instantly be punished for losing the high ground.  Now, with the new explosive mechanics paired with the SMG buff and tommy gun, LMG, and machine gun...there are TONS viable playstles. No more ""just build lol"". 

6. ""Meta"" loadouts come down to preference of playstyle...not to flavor of the month anymore. For several seasons it was always ""this loadout"" or ""that"" in which you either had it equipped or were at a serious disadvantage. This is not the case anymore. Every weapon seems viable and supports an equally viable playstyle. I love it. 

7. Last but not least...you can look at the kill feed and finally see something other than ""Player 1 shotgunned Player 2"" ...over and over and over.

TL;DR - In contrary to the post currently on the front page of this Reddit at time of posting, I absolutely LOVE the current state of the game. ",FortNiteBR

As a courtesy reminder, the subreddit will go into restricted mode during Patch downtime.

--- 

We reviewed all of the feedback we received during our first run of this mode, the feedback can be found:

**[here](https://imgur.com/a/jWSD7tN#dPSbXdF)**

---

**Here is how it will work:**

Once downtime begins around 3:45 - 4:00am EST - the sub will be entering restricted mode. Only Epic Employees and Moderators will be able to submit posts. You will still be able to comment (rules still apply)

## Why?

Normally, with each patch downtime, people already spam when is it coming up, where are patch notes, etc. We are anticipating this to be exponentially increased with this patch.

----

Patch Notes will be posted and stickied on the front page. Any news articles and relevant information will be posted either by Epic or a moderator.

**Once downtime ends, restricted mode will be TURNED OFF approximately 20-25 minutes after the servers are back up. At this time, people can freely post again.**

There will be our normal patch index megathread where we will continue to consolidate all the popular news, threads, and hot topics (such as datamined skins).

---

&gt; There’s a party and you’re invited! Patch v5.10 releases tomorrow, July 24 and it marks #Fortnite1st birthday.

&gt;Take a peek at the Patch Notes once downtime begins at 4 AM Eastern Time to learn what goodies are coming.

* I've seen educational commentary from sypherPK. Currently going to look for more. 

* I drop named locations. 

* I drop really really early (immediately upon timer hitting 0) if the first location is a hot spot (Paradise palms path for example)

* I drop sligggggtly off to the side to grab a gun uninterrupted hopefully and run right into the action. Sometimes I don't wait on shields. 

----

I have been able to get on average 3-6 kills within a minute or two of landing. It's SUPER INTENSE. and because of that i usually am left with no heals since i use them in between fights if i have a moment.  And people find me really fast since there's still like 10people + running around the same drop location. 

I know for a fact if i can simply survive or make the right strategic moves..i can take on people until there no one left. But i can't... I always end up dying. But when i don't i end up losing  in mid to end game and only collect 1-3 extra kills. I want to reach the 10 kill since my early game starts of extremely strong sometimes. 

**What else should i do? To survive when people are looking for me and I'm hopelessly low (under 50hp) or even start running out of bullets fast or materials, goe do i keep the momentum going**  


**What is the mid-late game stategy? Do i just walj from named place to named place? How do I maximize my chances of winning all at the same time.?**

This meta is the most versatile it's ever been.,"I'm not sure why so many people are complaining about the meta being dull already even though it's only been 2 weeks into the season. I want to address many of the issues that people believe are causing a ""dull"" meta even though this is the most refreshing and most flexible meta to have existed in Fortnite so far.

The itemizations. Shotguns are not the only kings now, and that's ok! Double shotgun is DEAD and this is the best thing to have happened for itemization in Fortnite. Having played through nearly all the seasons, I know how restricting it feels to be ""forced"" to have two shotguns at all times. First it was always having 2 pumps, then it went to pump + tact shotty/heavy pump, then it went back to a slower double pump, then with reduced shotty headshot damage it went to double heavy pumps. Shotguns were the ONLY meta for nearly 4 seasons and you think 2 weeks of season 5 is dull?!

Not to mention that when the heavy pump came out, it was mostly considered unusable compared to the regular pumps that could still headshot a 200/200 enemy. Now heavy pump is the ""strongest"" shotgun and I think that's awesome because EPIC changed and nerfed the shotgun meta to reduce the powerful presence of shotguns in the game all while allowing the heavy pump to rise as the ""best"" shotgun. 

Even though the meta still requires you to carry 1 shotgun, the rest of the itemization choices have become so flexible. You can carry blue silenced smg, blue smg, drum gun, lmg, snipers or explosives for your other items instead of sacrificing a slot for a blue pump. In the past, you would drop all of these things just for a second blue pump.  SMG spread, accuracy, and damage were not viable enough back then to replace a blue pump that could one shot a 200/200. LMG are still bad but I think the drum gun is the successful version of what the LMG should have been and this in itself is saying a lot. Nearly every new weapon that was introduced seemed underpowered and felt like they won't have a role in the meta. LMG, Minigun, C4, Thermal, Deagle, Double Handguns, Smoke Bombs, and Crossbow are all items that did not have a big impact on the meta during their introductions because double shotguns were still king. Now a weapon that is actually useful is released (drum gun) and players already want to call it dull.  

Explosive ammo is limited, C4 is actually useful now compared to its original state and when players wanted to vault it when sticky grenades came out. Hell I even take C4 over RPG if I have more C4 uses than RPG ammo. Building giant towers isn't priority anymore and even if players still do this, there are viable counters to pushing/taking down these buildings. Obtaining highground in build fights is still a good habit but now you can't mindlessly spam build higher since you can be knocked down. The build fight gameplay has changed and I think it's changed in a good direction. Less spam building and more opportunities for players to actually shoot each other. 

Even movement around the map has been the best it's ever been. Golf carts, shopping carts, rifts, bounce pads, and launch pads all allow players to move around the map faster which results in a faster frequency of fights between those players. The game used to be a lot slower for everyone when some players would spend nearly the whole game running just to get inside the white circle.

These are just my thoughts. I felt it was odd that players would complain about and endure the shotgun meta for nearly 4 seasons. Then when the meta actually changes so other weapons are viable, the meta is suddenly dull. What are your thoughts?

(Long),"I have found that that the first game I play every (new) day I win. This happens about 8/10 times and it happen in duos and squads when the other players are also playing their first game of the day. 

At first I thought it was just coincidence but this has happened more or less consistently every time (over 100 wins like this). Game developers understand that if you win you are more likely to play more and what’s more of a morale boost than winning your first game right. 

Epic created Gears of War. In gears online multiplayer it has been confirmed that the player playing their first game gets additional damage for that game helping them do well and marking them want to play more. 

Fortnite has 2 variables that can be exploited this way, bloom and rng damage with shotguns. 
I’m sure there are other more discrete factors but this is just what comes to mind straight away. Shotguns are still so inconsistent. How many times has a notsogood player hit you for ridiculous damage from 4000m away?

If this is a real mechanic then it is helping keep new players in the game as there is such a massive skill gap now between the newer and experienced players that they would normally not stand a chance.

There are times I will land in Solos and manage to get to a weapon before another player. If I choose not to kill him, and he ends up just sticking around with me, am I obligated to kill him to risk getting a ban?","The front page of this sub has seen a lot of videos, discussions and complaints about people queuing up in a Solos game at the same time, getting into the same game and teaming up. But what if the person just happens to be a complete stranger that believes they owe a life debt to you? Do you kill them to stop following you? Or do you just kind of go with the flow?

&amp;nbsp;

I'll jump straight to the scenario that happens to me every week when a new challenge comes out that requires you to ""Drop at X location and to do Y, Z amount of times.""

&amp;nbsp;

Here's the challenge: **Search 7 chests at Loot Lake.** Alright. Game 1, drop, land next to chest. Second to late. Player opens chest, gets gun, kills me. Game time: ~45sec. Game 2, drop, land next to chest. Swarmed players going to same chest. Someone opens chest. A complete manslaughter ensues for whoever nabbed the weapon that popped out. Game time:~45sec. Game 3, decide to drop at a lesser known, more difficult chest to get to. Break roof. No chest. Search for weapon. No avail. Die. Game time: ~60-90sec.

&amp;nbsp;

So. At this point I'm awfully frustrated with having to load in and out, and back in and back out of games. But being the person I am, I have to keep going until I get at least a few chests. So I drop, and this time, what the hell do you know, I beat the player to the chest and got the Open **and** the weapon. So. At this point, I am beyond all belief ready to extract some hellish revenge upon whatever sorry soul thought they could take that chest away from me. But in the back of my head I know that feeling. Of dropping constantly just to die with 10 seconds of landing. *It sucks.* So here is where the moral question pops into play:

&amp;nbsp;

Do you kill the unarmed player? After 3 or 4 games of failed attempts to getting a chest? After getting murdered within seconds. Do you kill that unarmed player, who is essentially the same person as you? Just trying to complete a challenge and move on. Well, **I do not kill the player.** Now let me tell you as briefly as I can why I choose to do this.

&amp;nbsp;

I have been in this players shoes a zillion times. I know the **exact** feeling he has at this moment. It is a **very** rare occurrence that I would survive this scenario. Which is how it should be. It is a game type that is a free-for-all, kill every single person you see. No teams. But. The thing about me, and has always been this thing with me. Is that I've been absolutely fucking fascinated with the idea of non-verbally making peace with an enemy. Ever since Rainbow Six 3 or Halo 2, using the in-game mechanics (crouching repeatedly or using emotes) to try and broker a peace between the two individuals. In a game where the **ONLY** purpose and mission is to eliminate the opposing force. And somehow, these rare little events can happen where the largest risk you could ever make, is made. You decide to make peace with an enemy, and with no verbal communication that trust is kept. That tiny, razor thin string of trust is kept. But to me, this has always just been so...amazing. So different. And the things you can do to try and communicate with each other is great. Especially with a game such as Fortnite, with the insane wide variety of emotes. Now, I choose not to kill this player because I know behind that shark mask, is a real player with thoughts and feelings and understanding. And if he could see the mercy I had in not killing him, he may have a change of heart too.

&amp;nbsp;

So. What I do **everytime** is this. So long as the player does not try to murder me with a balloon pick axe, I will spare their life. They may do an emote, and I will do one back. And if it were up to me, that would be the end of it. There are many branches from where things can go from here, depending on the players response. Sometimes they will just run off in the opposite direction and I will try to get away from them as far as I can. **Or...** They will follow me around. In this case, I will sometimes find a another weapon before them, and drop it for them. Sometimes a mini too (since I already likely used the 2 out of 3). This is a huge risk. And it has backfired on me a few times, literally. Now here the player can kill *me*, they will do an emote and leave, **OR**...they continue to follow me.

&amp;nbsp;

This is where things can get very interesting, but also very risky. I will do my best to tell the player we must part ways. I start with reloading a weapon that has a full clip. This makes my player model shake his head ""no."" If this doesn't stop them following me, I may keep going away from them, but building in a manner that makes it hard to follow me. I don't build to aggressively because it may make them freak out thinking I'm going to kill them. If there is nothing I can do, and this player simply thinks they owe a life-debt to me, then so be it. My last course of action, which has worked 100% of the time, is during our first encounter. I will die in the process. Done. Player following me dies. Done. Enemy dies. Not done. If we both survive the encounter, the player will usually run over to all the dropped loot. At this point I make my run for it. And 100% of the time I am too far away for them to follow or the don't know where I went.

&amp;nbsp;

I bring this up because I think everyone should experience something foreign and unique like this. I am not encouraging teaming up with strangers and trying to make it to the very end. I can see that being a bannable offense. But to simply just make friends with the enemy is really a great experience. To have this very tiny bond of trust, with someone who you can not talk to. Its exhilarating.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Dying by a duo in a Solos game does not automatically mean they are two friends that queued up at the same time to run game on everyone else. It could just be two strangers that chose to make peace with one another. Not saying that's okay, but at least its a little more organic than the deliberate exploit players are using. I would also strongly recommend not killing an unarmed player if they are emoting or showing no signs of aggression. ",FortNiteBR

Hi, I am NahroTo, 19 years old and an Android Developer.

In September 2017 I discovered Fortnite Battle Royale and found the game a lot of fun. Some weeks later I released my app for stats searching on the Play Store as the first Fortnite Battle Royale app on the Google Play Store: **RoyaleStats**. At the time I also posted it on Reddit, you can find the post here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/78ntoh/royalestats\_released\_the\_very\_first\_android\_app/](https://new.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/78ntoh/royalestats_released_the_very_first_android_app/)

That was in October 2017. Fast-moving forward to March 2018, my app was getting alot of users. I was adding new features to the app and was trying it to make it the best companion tool for Fortnite on Android. Alot of users were happy. It was the most popular Fortnite app on the Play Store.

**You can see a web archive of my app page back in March 2018:** [**https://web.archive.org/web/20180306221544/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nahroto.royalestats**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180306221544/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nahroto.royalestats)

I kept adding features and updates in order to make it a great app experience for Fortnite on the Android phone.

1-2 months later, my app hit 1 million downloads. The user reviews were becoming really positive and alot of people were happy with my app. Times were great,  I was really happy that my hard work and time paid off. I, as an Android developer, finally made an app that took off!

# The issue

27th of June I suddenly get the following email from Google: [https://i.imgur.com/ov0BglQ.png](https://i.imgur.com/ov0BglQ.png) .

Basically the email tells me that they suspended my app because it violated their Impersonation policy, and I have to resubmit the app with the needed changes so that it complies with the policy. What needed changes exactly? They don't mention it. If I think the suspension was an error, I can send them an appeal and they look into it in 1-2 days.

And that's what I did, I sent an appeal and asked for a more detailed reasoning what of my app violates the policy. I also told them that many other Fortnite apps on the Play Store also use the Fortnite name in their title (and still do).

The response of the employee: [https://i.imgur.com/np78t4X.png](https://i.imgur.com/np78t4X.png) basically saying my app shows unclear affiliation with Fortnite. I respond with the following:

*""I read the impersonation policy and I understand the rules completely. However, my app is quite big and I have no idea which part of my app violates the policy. Is it the app logo? The name of my app is ""RoyaleStats for Fortnite Battle Royale Stats"", is it the name ""Fortnite Battle Royale"" in my app name that violates the policy? If none of the above is the reason why my app violated the policy, then what is? Could you please give a detailed answer on that? If I have to correct the violations of my app and republush it, I first have to know what violated the policy in order to correct it. ""*

employee's response:

*""Hi NahroTo,*

*Thanks again for contacting Google Play Developer Support.*

*As much as I'd like to help, I’m not able to provide any more information or a better answer to your question. In our previous email, I made sure to include all the information available to me.*

*You should be able to find more information about your issue here:*[*Impersonation and Intellectual Property*](https://play.google.com/about/ip-impersonation/impersonation/)

*If you have a different question about the Play Developer Console, please let me know.""*

The worst part is that, during the days I was sending these mails, my app got a breaking bug that caused it to crash on startup on ALL devices. Since my app was removed from the Play Store, I couldn't push an update to fix the bug. So all of my users can't enter the app currently as it crashes immediatly, and probably because of that deleted it. So I lost probably majority of my users...

So the only chance I had left is, like the first mail said, publish the app again as a NEW app, so that means I will lose all ratings and downloads I had, starting from scratch. Since I still didn't knew what the reason was my app was violating the policy, I decided to reformat the name of my app to the same structures the other Fortnite apps on the Play Store were having (and apparently dont  violate the policy): [https://i.imgur.com/NzG0OWf.png](https://i.imgur.com/NzG0OWf.png) .

So I renamed the title from ""RoyaleStats for Fortnite Battle Royale Stats"" to ""RoyaleStats for Fortnite (Unofficial)"". This app ALSO got rejected and suspended for the exact same vague reason. So I submit the app as new AGAIN this time with the exact same format as an other Fortnite app on the Play Store ""RoyaleStats - Companion for Fortnite"" with a new safer logo: [https://i.imgur.com/mZRRAqP.png](https://i.imgur.com/mZRRAqP.png). I made this logo based on another app that changed its logo to a new one after being also suspended (but reinstated when he updated its logo), you can see his logo here on his app page: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.ownii.battlebusdriver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.ownii.battlebusdriver) . You can see we both use a symbol of Fortnite, him the bus, me the paraglider, with our app names under it. I also put disclaimers in the description of my app saying I am not affiliated with Epic Games etc.

Few days later, the app gets REJECTED and SUSPENDED again. After asking again WHY, I get a new response from a different employee:

*"" During review, we found that your app violates the* ***Impersonation and Intellectual Property*** *policy. We don’t allow apps that use another app or entity’s brand, title, logo, or name in a manner that may result in misleading users.*

*Apps must not have names or icons that appear confusingly similar to existing products or apps that come with the device (such as Camera, Gallery or Messaging).*

*You can read through the* [*Impersonation and Intellectual Property*](https://play.google.com/about/ip-impersonation/impersonation/) *policy page for more details and examples of common violations.*

***For example, your app currently contains contents of Fortnite.""***

I disclaimed everything, made sure I have my own brand in my logo, and renamed the title to make sure it cleary suggests it isn't officialiy affiliated with Fortnite, yet copied the structure of other accepted apps on the store of their titles, but still it apparently misleads users.

I'm sad.

**The only way I see them reinstating my app is me including a message from Epic saying something like ""..Epic allows the app on the Play Store, Epic is allright with it"" and sending that included in the appeal.** I believe that the suspension of RoyaleStats also negatively impacts the happiness of the Fortnite players themselves, since the biggest Fortnite companion app on Android is gone now. Alot of people were using my app daily, what causes them to keep thinking about Fortnite during the day, during their pauses etc what caused them to be closer to Fortnite and gave them more ""cant wait till Im home to play Fortnite"" etc.

Just a bunch of sheep repeating stuff they hears who can't form their own opinions. Look forward to laughing at your triggered low witt replies.

1. Xbox players thinking their automatically better than everyone on PS4 saying we don't/can't build #FactsNotOpinion even though we both use controllers and have the fastest builders and our pro players do better in tournaments vs PC.
I dunno it's probably just douchey American NA kids trolling but they Legit think they're the best and they probably also think their NA servers are better than Europe servers for Xbox lol (Remember we all play in different time zones, meaning we have different peak times)

2. ""Oh me gehd Noizey is the best console player ever. I don't care if people say he uses a keyboard &amp; Mouse "" Smh. 
I dunno if he was using a keyboard and mouse at one point or if it was just because he was just op on standard playing claw but now I think he uses Builder Pro which he's still learning. 
I dunno when I look at his full-ish gameplay. He looks like an Average player and doesn't look miles better than people that stream on PS4 (Lowkey I see loads of people who switched to Builder Pro and they look way faster than his gameplay clips with B.P.). 
It looks like he was fast on K&amp;M and now he's trying to use a controller since people called him out and sneak dissed him ( Gronky - Whiney Decent jelly of Noizey's overhyped Clout.. Xbox Player )",FortNiteBR

479,133112,1532360515,9184g7,17,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9184g7/theorythe_coming_collision/,4,(Theory)The coming Collision.,"Recently I was watching a Fortnite video by Dr Pineapplez, one of my favorite YouTubers, when I had an idea. My theory is that by the phrase ""Worlds Collide"" they mean the Norse and Egyptians will collide in a War. I saw that the Magnus description was ""Conquer the Storm"". Also, I thought about Ragnarok. Not the skin, the event it is named for. The event in Norse mythology is where there is a great war or flood or something and everyone but two people dies. The Vikings were Conquerers, and lived in Scandinavia. I believe that it is saying that we will see more Viking artifacts wherever the snowstorm and Winter Biome go. The next thing I thought about was the teasers. One shows a Norse battle axe, which is a weapon used in combat. Another shows that cat mask. One of the Egyptian gods that was visualized to be in the form of a lion, which is still a member of the cat family, is Maahes\*, the god of war. Son of the cat goddess Sekhmet and the creator god Ptah. Most people have seen the Pyramid by now. If it comes out of the waters of Loot Lake, then it would be a lot like it was being created, wouldn't it? Also, when we looked at the Norse side of this, we saw hints about my theory in their culture. Same here. The Egyptians were farmers. If the Snow Biome took over the Pyramid in Loot Lake(Which I will assume is the Egyptians' base) they wouldn't be able to farm what they were used to, and that could result in Famine. The last time in Egypt there was Famine, it brought along a Civil War.

By now you probably want to come to my house and scream at me that these could just be little coincidences. But I ask of you, what was the first thing I said as proof from in this post? A skin description. What is that cat mask part of? A skin. What is Ragnarok in Fortnite? A skin. In the past, the skins have shown what is going on. Dark Voyager and the Meteor in Season 3. The Superheroes/Villains and the Rocket in Season 4. Also, they just released the Arctic Command set again. That set name sounds like Arctic Commando. Where are Vikings from again? The North. Where is the Arctic circle? The Far North. What are Vikings? Conquerers. What does it sort of sound like(sort of, not completely)? Commando. What do they do? Fight. Where in the world would most of them be fighting right now? The Middle East. What does it have a lot of? Sand. Like Egypt, a whole lot of sand. And where are those Commandos from? The Arctic. And what area is associated with the Arctic? Scandinavia. Be ready for War. Season 5 will have some.

When my squad sees a skull trooper everyone starts screaming that there's a skull trooper in our lobby. It is something that is exciting and fun to spot. On top of that, come Christmas and Halloween time, I want to see new, revamped skins.  Epic is pretty good at making sweet skins and I would love to see what else they could come up with.

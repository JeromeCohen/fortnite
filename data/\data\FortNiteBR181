He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Keanu put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt.

Running is really exhausting and I'm fat and lazy.," I don't know about you but with soaring in every game mode I adapted so quickly to this mechanic.
I can't live without it(maybe a little exaggerating)

 It's so comfortable and the game plays so smooth and at such a fast pace. It would be really strange removing this mechanic, especially because I think that this is another amazing mechanic which seperates fortnite from other BR's:

Usually BR's are really slow(especially during midgame), you walk around and see no enemy's. This way you can decide if you wanna build up and play agressive or just rotate and farm/loot.

Also because of this I find myself constantly in buildfights and I love it, since you can engage them more often and won't be punished if some random noskin trys to shoot you down from 100 meters. 


And now I want to refer to a point where a lot of people complained, saying that it takes out the skill gap in buildfights because you don't have to keep track of your surroundings since you can't get shot down anymore:

-i noticed the fights aren't pinpointed to a certain location. They go all across the map, since people disengage if you don't fight efficiently .
-thats why you have to evaluate if you wanna keep chasing/fighting.
-material management becomes even bigger as people can reset easier.


Most important: 

-takes out RNG by 3rd party. Sometimes when you get 3rd partyied by 3 or 4 people there was literally nothing you could do especially if you just won a fight and were low HP. Now you can reposition yourself and reset.

-&gt; yes you could say "" you have no map awareness"". However with so many people on the map if you coincidentally run in 4-5 players at once you still have a chance.

TL:DR -&gt; Python program tell you who could be stream sniping you

I made this program in Python (as stated above), it's free to use for anyone. It was made to just tell you who is in your games repeatedly. Regardless of if your old replays are deleted or corrupted, this will hold all your old replay information and show it to you. It updates live as you play the game, it's a quick fun project of mine and I'm sure some programmers will be appalled at the codes cleanliness/methods (might clean that up someday). The big goal was to help out those who stream and get their games ruined by players who've got nothing better to do with their time but grab a gun and rift/move onto a streamers exact position over and over. However, I always run it on my side monitor just to see how often the same players are in my games (not very often I've learned, had this tested with 100 replays, only about 15-20 repeated players [excluding friends] from 5000+ players), so you can do that also if you wish. If necessary, I'll make a video guide on how to use this program...

First post, hope I met whatever posting requirements that exist. Just a note to the intended audience (talking about you streamers), be very careful making judgement calls before reporting someone, if someone is in your game 30+ times in an hour; fine, they're stream sniping you, but just being in your game 3-6 times isn't pure evidence. This is a helper program, not some AI that spits out the verdict on whether or not you should report someone, evaluate for yourself.

Have fun and enjoy :)",FortNiteBR

I'm glad that the cool Halloween stuff came back, that everyone is happy buying whatever skin, pickaxe, glider or emote they like, but y'all don't need to be a-holes and spam offensive/sarcastic comments to everyone who has been playing the game and supporting it since day one.

Then I realize that these little shits aren't there to just defend themselves, they want to kill anyone who comes anyone near them.  Which would be fine, if I could avoid them, but they are goddamn EVERYWHERE.  While killing them does give shield, and sometimes even good drops, to me those perks aren't worth the hassle.  

Ever since the monsters have been added it's just been a case of either I hear someone shooting them so I move in for the kill.  Whether I get the kill or not doesn't matter, because if I do get the kill, now I have a metric fuck ton of monsters on my ass who will kill me shortly thereafter.  Or, I have to fight off the monsters that are on my ass, only to have someone hear me fighting them and come over and kill me.  The only way to avoid this is to solely use the crossbow as it won't attract anyone due to noise.  

I wish Epic made this as a different gamemode, or made it where they won't go after you until you attack them first, then I'd have nothing to complain about.  But for now, I feel like they kind of ruin my enjoyment of the game because there are just too many of them and it's not easy to just stay away from them.",FortNiteBR

• Epic refuses to change the skirmish format even though everyone camps in 1x1s.
• The servers were supposed to be improved for better stability when there are a lot of players in a single area. As far as I can tell that hasn’t happened yet. 
• A lot of unnecessary/noob friendly stuff is added to the game and when used by a skilled player it’s extremely irritating (Grappler, Double Barrel, Shadow Stones, SMGs, etc) 
• Also I think Epic doesn’t really care about the founders or the “OG” players. 
• They nerf damn near everything into the dirt
• They don’t listen to the player base

These are just a few things I thought of on the fly. Curious what y’all have to say about it. Thanks",FortNiteBR

When all of a sudden, a wild teknique skin appears. (this is made even better by the fact that I was in the abstrakt skin at the time.) As I spent almost all my time harvesting mats I only had a green pump and planned to kill her.

But then I realised something.

She didn’t try fighting me.

Because of this I began dancing and so did she, before I knew it we were teamed. After this we travelled all over the map. From retail, to salty, to fatal and eventually ending up near the desert/grass border somewhere.

We both got into a 2x2 I built and managed to get are 3rd kill between us. Then I decided to follow through on my plan and build a sky base. And she followed. The next part is obvious but it got shot down and we glided to safety, but then.

A wild soccer skin sweat appears.

They were building non stop and kept trying to build over us, but with our combined firepower we managed to demolish all of her structures.

But then it took a turn for the worse.

The soccer skin, realising it might be beaten by people goes full sweat mode and manages to kill teknique.

Press F to pay your respects.

It was up to me the abstrakt to kill the last two people, not for me but for my fallen friend.

The first rival, jonesy. He put up a challenging fight of standing still and shooting a scar but even that didn’t save him.

Now there was two people left. It was all or nothing and I wouldn’t accept the later.

I got some good damage on him and his shield was gone. But most of my health was as well. I was down to 30 health, no shield.

And then it happened.

I was behind a tree trying to use a medkit when he showed up. I had to win now.

He tried going around one way, smg, then the other way.

And when he did...

I managed to fire a blue tact perfectly making a 10/10 headshot.

I had completed my goal. And to my fallen accomplice.

Thank you

[All the visitor did was modify an already made rocket](https://i.imgur.com/4iwwvWe.png), and it doesn't make sense the filmmakers made it.

[The villian base has a logo, Omega and his minions don't have it anywhere on them, not even Oblivion's glider.](https://i.imgur.com/benAAux.jpg) Because as we know, they were just actors that used the meteorite's timing and probably the already made villain's base.

'Oh but where are you going at?' good question, only two characters in the game are shown to have the base logo on their sets, Omen (His chest) and Fate (The glider came with her on a different day than Omen's), both leaked along the Visitor back then. 

[Fate's loading screen portraying her actually eliminating people inside the Villain's base](https://i.imgur.com/b274G8K.png)

The descriptions of the Overseer set describe that they're able to look at the future, [Omen's loading screen being exactly that](https://i.imgur.com/cMCYB3R.png)

You could say I'm reaching here but what do you see on that pickaxe? [Does that ominous purple smoke and lightning remind you of something?](https://i.imgur.com/etPvKUl.png) 

Another point for this theory is: Why would the visitor warn the entiretely of the island before he launched the rocket? And why would he do that with TVs showing a skull? The real plan was for Omen and Fate to destroy Tilted Towers, all they knew is that they needed to set the rocket towards it for their visions to come true, they didn't know the Visitor had anything to do with it.

This is why the rocket targeted tilted towers [using those red lasers](https://i.imgur.com/IryxTlx.png), that was the initial plan. The Visitor messed up with that, causing the series of events that lead to the Cube getting into the island.

Once the looting timer is up, Patient Zero spawns in as an upgraded zombie, and they have to get melee hits to turn people. Once a player is turned, they become a zombie as well. 

When there's only four people left (one squad), an extraction point appears on the island, similar to the ones in the getaway ltm. If the human players can get to the getaway bus, they're safe and they get the victory royale. If they don't, and everyone's turned, the zombies win",FortNiteBR

I figured I would wait and see how the game went playing maybe a couple hours all of season 5. Season 6. Still just meh. All the changes I disliked (to lowering the building/skill gap) are still there with more added. Now, I have played maybe 30 minutes this season.   
Last year I bought the scythe and was still stoked I had an original item. I hated the skull trooper so I passed on it. I saw when the ST came back out the people who bought it originally still had the original design and others would get a similar look. I was hopeful that would have been for all the original stuff. Sadly (IMO), they release the scythe as its original. Meaning I kinda lost my stand out thing from playing for so long (this is more of a side note. Not the reason I am leaving. Just a very small factor).   
Well, since the game isn't as enjoyable to me and now I really don't have my cool rare scythe to show off when I play with friends (not as big of an issue as the game play), I am just going to move on like a tumbleweed in the summer breeze. Many of you don't care and will down vote or leave a ""Bye"" comment because I am expressing my opinions and they differ from yours. I also know there are a lot of people who feel the same. Personally, I don't mind. Everyone has things that appeal to them more.  
It was a fun run. I never liked cartoony games like this but at the time it was a free BR and the only one for PS4. I started playing and was HOOKED immediately. It was such a rush to get into build fights. Your practice could shine through like no other and the fights could be intense! Granted, I wasn't the best, but I had a blast! Then they started the building changes.....  
Auto swap mats: It used to be where you needed to pay attention to your mat count. If you ran out of one material you had to manually swap materials or you would just sit there jumping like a kangaroo in front of the enemy. Now, the mats auto swap. No biggie. A slight lowering of the skill gap but all good.  
Turbo building: Once this took effect timing your builds was no longer an issue. Rather than having to set walls at the correct times you can just hold a trigger down. Another lowering of the skill gap. No biggie. All ok still  
Explosive changes: Many more explosives were added as well as the radius being changed. It used to be that if someone was spam rocketing you could just keep building and the wall they shot would be destroyed. Now, anything withing a 1x1 is gone. 4 walls, floors and stairs. A lot of mats gone. Yes, I know they limited the ammo capacity to try and balance it, but I feel the mats lost is huge for one explosive. No biggie. We can work with that.  
Then llamas came in!: We used to get 500 of each material. Now we get half that but they added no more llamas. Kind of killing the rush of finding one.  
Then port a forts: Building in an emergency is a skill no longer needed if the RNG blesses you. Throw it down in the beginning and watch everyone marvel at you instant pile of metal.  
Then grapples, shadow stones, etc. A lot of things added to counter builds and also to make phasing through builds a thing.   
All in all, none of the changes really affected too much on their own but as a whole, they team up and massively changed the ""fort"" in Fortnite for me.  
Now, I am not saying the game is dying or that it will anytime in the next few years, I am just saying that with so many changes to core game play can really start to get people moving to other games (such as me).  
Epic was very smart to add the big prize tourneys. It became a chance for massive cash which kept a lot of streamers on the game (even ones who talked about switching) because the only way to get those prizes is to play and win. This in turn, keeps a crowd of viewers and makes the game stay in the spotlight. Very very smart.   
Unfortunately, for someone like me who was already jumping out of my ideal graphics to enjoy the game play, now I don't have the game play to enjoy and I never liked the graphics... So, with that, I wish all of you the best and want to give a big thanks to all those who have chatted with me in the subreddit. Also a big thanks to Epic for making a game that helped me step out of my comfort zone. I will always have a soft spot for the game and very fond memories. Even including a 0 kill win. You popped my BR cherry and it felt so good! It is time for me to drift on to the next game. Good luck to all you fellow gamers! ",FortNiteBR

I feel like going back to old Fortnite (pre-event) will feel super bland and boring compared to this.  


**tldr; Fortnitemare mode has WAY better game pacing, way more action, way more engages, and I'm not spending ANY games just running across the entire map because of unlucky zones. I do however think some tweaks could be made as always to make it even better.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Glider Redeploy**

This is probably the most controversial change added in the last patch but I am loving it for map traversal and overall improvement to mobility. The one thing I would like to see here however is the risk of fall damage. If I had to change anything here it would be to only allow redeploying of your glider IF and ONLY IF you jump (out of combat). What I mean by out of combat is when not being shot at, or if the ramp / floor is shot out from under you, you should fall. But if you are ramping up and choose to jump off, then you can redeploy. This way we could keep the mobility and have the risk / reward of good building again.

&amp;#x200B;

**Zombies / Pillars**

While the ambient noise and zombie noises are maybe a bit TOO loud in my opinion, I feel like they have added a 4th dimension to the game other than farm,(pickax), engage(combat), run. There is now a way to get shields, random loot, ammo, but at a HUGE risk of giving away your position. Or you can use them to bait people to coming to you and then engage on them from an unexpected angle. Furthermore they add a ton of pressure / decision making in-between fights and right after fights because they will smash your 1x1 wood structures down when you are trying to revive a squad mate. having a soft combat PVE thing to interact with during these intense PVPmatches feels really nice and I hope this stays around longer than just a Halloween event.

&amp;#x200B;

**Increased Loot**

It just feels a lot better to be more equipped more of the time, I haven't had a single match where I felt a super unfair advantage landing in an area and not getting a single gun or barely enough ammo to carry me through a single fight. having this increased loot / mobility to utilize the loot feels so much better.  


**Combined Summary**

I think any one of these changes in a vacuum would have unbalanced the games feel and fun, but together Epic has really created a work of art of fun, faster paced game-play that isn't fatiguing or tedious. Maybe there could slightly fewer zombie pillars overall, and the loot can always be minorly tweaked here and there, and I think they need to re-introduce the threat of falling in a build fight, but overall I LOVE THIS UPDATE. but I'm just a random guy on the internet with a hardon for good game design.

So you can't just do season 2 if you never bought it.

This would be a sigh of relief to the level 78s of season 4.

I don't see any downsides to this because you'd only be given a small amount of time and if you paid for the battle pass and couldn't reach tier 100 due to work, school or time constraints this would just be a nice thing to add.

I, in no way shape or form, do not consider myself ""OG"". I started playing STW when it hit Xbox but only started playing BR during the last half of Season 2. I do not own any ""OG"" cosmetics and have no want in purchasing them. I am not particularly fond of the Purple Skull Trooper exclusive but I do however want to see some consistancy. 

**[Inconsistencies]**

Red Knight is considered an ""OG"" skin. Was re-released as is. No extra whosits and no extra whatsits. There was a minor error where the Back Bling was not granted but that was fixed. Was originally available in Season 2.

Skull Trooper is considered an ""OG"" skin. Was re-released with challenges for a Back Bling and came with color options. A special Purple color was released for ""OGs"" who purchased the skin in Season 2.

The Reaper is considered an ""OG"" pickaxe. Was re-released with no features to recognize Season 2 purchasers.

How about all of the Christmas skins?

Today’s post is going to be an update on where we stand on some mobile concerns this week. I want to start out by responding to a few concerns that have been raised since the release of patch 6.20. The currently reported issues that are new this week that we are tracking are:

* Long load time
* VOIP Audio is low

These are the two newest issues that have come up this week since patch 6.20. Issues that we are tracking since season 6 launch are the above plus: **\*NOTE NOT EVERY ISSUE WILL BE LISTED\***

* Matchmaking 201 error
* Textures appear blurry
* Storm effects persisting after leaving the storm
* Battlepass and other cosmetics ( including emotes) not displaying correctly
* Use the horn on ATK and Quadcrasher
* The camera becomes “jerky” in some cases

Those are just some of the issues we are tracking. Now I will go over a few points that players think are “Bugs” but are actually not bugs at all.

* Edit button not showing  

   * The new HUD has removed the 2nd edit button. This is by design and allows the player to move 1 button and have it show in combat, build, and edit mode.
* Dedicated fire button cannot be removed from combat mode  

   * When you select dedicated fire as your choice you will see the 2nd button on your right-hand side that allows you to fire and place buildings. Right now the design is that this dedicated fire button is always shown and turns into a placement button. You can not remove the visibility for this button since the dedicated fire was chosen. You can, however, remove it from being visible by moving it off your HUD into the “extra” button section. This also removes it as a placement button and only allows the left-hand side button to be used.
* Edit “Bug”  

   * After reviewing reports it seems there is a miscommunication on our part to explain how editing works. Here is an example: You build a wall and edit the 3 tiles to create a walkway out. You then run through it and want to undo the edit to the wall so the other player can not chase you. In order to do this or re-edit any edited structure, you need to be looking at part of the structure that has **NOT** been edited. Meaning to return the wall to a full wall in my example, you need to look at the top right or left part of the wall that your crosshairs can hover over. This will allow you to use your edit button and edit the wall any way you like. I hope this explains how editing works, as this is the case on **ALL** platforms.
* Crouching in build mode  

   * So you want to crouch while in build mode? Well, you can not right now :( BUT we are working on it! No hard ETA but this was **NOT** a bug. It was a design choice as other platforms also lost the ability to crouch while in build mode, but the ability to toggle a setting on allowed them to now do so and we are working on the same for mobile! This is more of an issue when going against cross-platform players since they would seemingly have an advantage as no one on mobile could crouch while in build mode. In a mobile-only lobby, it was much less of an issue.
* Quick building “bug”  

   * This is something I was a bit worried to put in here but I know it is needed. I have seen the videos of players sending me that there is a bug where placing a wall while holding down the placement/fire button down. I have been testing this over and over again based on all of the videos I have seen and **CAN NOT** get this to happen to me. I am trying to see what the issue could be here. How I have been testing this:  

      * Grab a weapon such as AR or SMG and gather mats
      * Hold down the fire button on the weapon and while shooting press my wall button then switch back to the weapon. The result for me has been shooting bullets---wall is built---moving around while holding the button down walls are still built---- switching to ramps, they are still built while holding the button---switch to the weapon while holding button--- weapon fires.
   * As you see I have tried to get turbo building to not work while switching between combat and build mode but have not yet had any issues. Please continue to send me videos if this is happening, as I am monitoring this issue and will try to keep on reproducing the issue for the team. Also if you have this happen PLEASE REPORT IT! Use the feedback button and report the issue as the subject, “Turbo Build” then describe what happens in the body text box. Reporting the issue gives us your player logs for that game and allows us to get a more detailed report.

One last thing I would like to point out is how much as been done since Season 6 has launched for mobile nearly 20 bullet points in patch notes have been added in Season 6 with a lot of fixes that the team has been working hard on here are just a few of the big ones:

* Interaction bug fixed
* Custom HUD
* Resizeable buttons
* Players can now edit structures while in combat mode while holding any weapon.
* Memory improvements mobile
* The first weapon you pick up will now auto-equip itself on mobile.
* Touch control input now has smoothing enabled.
* Tapping selected buttons on the build quickbar will once again build the selected build piece.
* All elements in the Mobile HUD should now be placeable/movable in the HUD Layout Tool.
* Updated visuals for independent Quickbar slots in the HUD Layout Tool.
* Drag and dropping on the Quickbar will no longer select the thing you drag. Players can now adjust their inventory without interrupting other actions.
* Fixing edit button visibility issues when crouching on Mobile

Ok, so this was a long post! Thank you for reading all of this and my goal is that this was helpful for you all to not only see what we are tracking but also maybe gain some knowledge on how the game mechanics work. I think weekly or bi-weekly updates are something I may do a bit more often to better keep you all in the loop. I also hope that this shows just how far mobile has come in Season 6! The goal is to continue to give players an amazing in game and social experience when playing Fortnite.

Thanks for being an awesome community,

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, when I log into Fortnite (ps4), my loadout will be completely different..whatever, I can deal with that. I also notice that my epic friends will sometimes have been deleted, and often I'll see an epic friend online who I have never in the past seen before in my life, usually I just remove them asap, but next time I need to make sure I ask them who they are. On the other side of things, I'll check my fortnite tracker, and it will have matches recorded between the time when I last logged out and logged in.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had 2 step verification on, and each time I notice these strange things happen, I reset my password.

- He was rolling over the map FOR WEEKS without saying anything. He just took our land and made it his own without asking for permission. 

- He once again destroyed something. My favourite shop on the citad... I mean Tilted Towers without any apologize whatsoever. You can't do that man! That was someones company! Now he has to rebuild it on his own! Who the hell is going to pay for that?!

- If you tried to have fun with him by introducing him to your golden Scar, he just randomly punched you in the face, lowering your HP and pushing you back with strong force. I mean... what kind of person does that? We just wanted to have some fun ya know?

- He pissed into the lake with his sticky purple urine covering the whole thing. DUDE! Our children liked to do their swimming in there!

- He stole my friend's house, owner of the loot lake mansion with his garden and made some kind of a flying toy. Seriously... I had to make room upstairs for my friend because you stole his HOUSE.

- After Kevin got bored he didn't put my friend's house in the right place. He just destroyed it. Again - no apologize from him. That was all he's got!

- And then he decided to spawn frikking ZOMBIES on our lands. That's just not cool.

***TL:DR***

\- Epic games should consider splitting the tournaments for each respective platform in order to make a more even playing field for each. PC has a clear advantage, and it is nearly impossible to get a tournament pin as a console or mobile player.



I must admit, I absolutely love the new tournament system that Epic Games has introduced to Fortnite, but I do have one major concern regarding it. **PC players have a clear and distinct advantage over all other platforms.**



I play Fortnite on Playstation, and I would consider myself better than many other Playstation players out there. I'm very competitive, and I rarely lose a 1v1 engagement (PSN: UndeadArcher2000, check the stats if you have doubts.) For the first solo tournament, I was able to get 21 points on the second day, earning the pin for the tournament. It was **extremely** difficult to do, though, and it would not have been possible if I were any less skilled at the game (I'm trying desperately to not sound arrogant in any way at all, plenty of people are better than I am.)



Even with my decent skill level, I could immediately recognize a good PC player when I saw them simply based on how they built, how they edited, how good their accuracy was, etc., and many of them wiped me out completely. With a keyboard and mouse, the player has easy advantages over someone using a controller with two joysticks:

1. The mouse has the ability to be much more precise and accurate when shooting than a small joystick that is usually controlled by a thumb.
2. The keyboard and key-binds unique to the experienced player allow for insane building, editing, and weapon swapping.
3. Sensitivity is much less of a concern to PC players, as they can control how quickly they look around in-game much easier with the mouse, allowing for easier shots that would be much harder to pull off for controller players.

These are just some example reasons, as I'm sure more could be found. Some people may say that If NickMercs and other professional console players can do it, then we can. This is true, to an extent, but as far as I know of, Nick has yet to win any of the major Fortnite tournaments.



Finally, I decided to try the duo tournament with a friend of mine who also has decent stats. Once we got to 9 points, we gave up due to the insane skill of all players in the game. Once we hit that point, even as competitive and strategic players, we were getting our butts kicked in every fight due to the enemies using a mouse and keyboard.



If Epic Games were to split the tournaments apart, I think it would allow for a much more even playing field for each platform, as people on mobile do not even stand a remote chance of winning a pin against experienced console and PC players. When it comes down to the final tournament, such as the Fortnite World Cup, then they could throw all of the best players from each platform together in a single game to truly determine who is best.



I apologize for the long rant, but, as a hoping-to-be-professional player and very long time Fortnite player, it is a concern that I feel should at least be considered. I hope some out there may agree with me.

I remember the day playing on Tokyo servers playing with 150-200 ms and our experience in the game wasn't really that great due obviously high latency and I have been playing for a long time with that latency so I decided to put some effort and made some kind of ""SEA Server please"" videos and uploading to this sub reddit, Just to get some attention to our problems and It really did well and they noticed it and said they are working on a solution for this and a month later Fortnite announced ""Sub-Region Matchmaking"" where they introduced Singapore server implemented to ""Asia"" region and recently they giving the same treatment by adding more servers in different locations as well, Boy, I was so happy &amp; excited that day when they finally acknowledged and added Singapore server into Asia region until to this day, We are still not very happy about it, Why? Epic Games scheme was instead of putting players into their closest region, They have gone with the ""superfast matchmaking"" where that ""If we don't find a lobby closes to you in 15 seconds, We are going to put you in a different lobby with higher latency, Just to save 1-2 minutes of matchmaking, Even there are comments of player saying about this that day on reddit like ""Epic Games, we are willing to wait 1-5 minutes just to put in right server or just please add a seperate server selection in options."" but Epic Games does not really like slower matchmaking, Why try to make us get us into a game immediately only for players just to quit and re-queue hoping to get another lobby in SEA server? Does it have to be really inconsistent? So I have talked with one of Epic Games Staff and this is the response they gave us is a response and It's something like this ""We are still optimizing our subregion matchmaking thresholds for players who play in sub region servers with a higher chance to get the server they needed"", Why even add a threshold in first place? Fortnite is literally one of the top games that being played everywhere and I know that for a fact there are enough players to keep the matchmaking time low and put is in right server, Epic Games could have just added another region selection in options called ""Singapore"" but instead they decided to add those server under ""Asia"" category and They have told us that they didn't want to add and show as a different server selection due to ""Low playerbase pool"". How wouldn't it? Why would people bother playing the game in high latency in first place and ruining their experience? &amp; New players around South East Asia are going to play their first match and It's probably going to put them randomly in a wrong server and they just going to think ""Well, fortnite still doesn't have Singapore server and  just leave it right there."" Even I seen some streamers from South East Asia where they are leaving games like ""Oh, another Tokyo/Japan server"" and viewers are asking why did you quit the game and explaining them they got put in wrong server lobby and You going to be doing this requeue thing for your rest of your life If you are from South East Asia and You know at some point It's going to be tiring. At this point I feel like Epic Games just wanted to do temporary hot fix and leave it as it is.


So Epic Games, Your solution for Sub Region Matchmaking is not really working well and It's been the same over the month and It needs to go. Please add Singapore as a separate server like every other region and and If other players can do it, Why can't we as well?


Well that's it, I hope you guys feel the same way as us on this case, Our experience playing the game is gradually going off and Hoping Epic Games would do something about this.


Sorry for my bad england.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought a bit about how Epic could balance the Re-deployable Glider, so it might become a thing in the regular game modes.  


1. **Initial thoughts**  
At the moment the deploy height of the Glider is, if I remember correctly, 10 metres, which is about 2 walls (and a jump) high on even ground. So, let's say 2 walls high. I think, that height is way too low. It is even below fall dmg, which is 3 walls high. So, even if you would take no fall damage at all, you would be able to deploy the Glider.   
That enables a lot of players to use it to escape even low-height build fights, making it so much more difficult to actually fight them. Also, if people run away, they just have to build 3 ramps to activate the Glider, which makes chasing really frustrating, especially if you then get third-partied.   
On the other hand, the game becomes way faster and you can travel the map without thinking about the storm. But, if Re-deployable Gliders would be a thing, it would make every other mobility item kind of useless (Jump Pad, Ghost Stones, cars...).   

2. **My idea**  
I think, the problem with the Re-deployable Glider is the low height it can be deployed at. 2 walls is nothing and it is a no-brainer to just double press jump when you fall, just in case. That mechanic doesn't need any skill and is never punished, actually you might get punished if you don't use it. Since Epic tries to embrace different play styles, the deploy-height doesn't contribute to this at all. I think, that changing the deploy-height of the Glider could actually lead to different play styles and therefore would fit into Epics concept. On the picture I made you can see different heights, which I think, could be a possibility. One is 6 walls high, the next one 10. But these are just my thoughts and they will just serve as example for this post.  

3. **Effects of changing the deploy-height**

* **The player has to use more material.**   
Since 10 walls (or 6 walls) high are just more than 2 walls high, the player simply has to use more material to get to that height. If he is low on materials and has no chance to farm for the next fights, he has to decide if using the Glider is worth using the leftovers of his material. The deploy-height of 10 walls forces the player to care more about his material (even if it is not that much more). Also, you just have to build ramps without and further structures, because it doesn't matter if you get shot down immediatley or the enemy first has to get through 3 layers (further explanation below).  

* **A player is more visible and therefore more vulnerable**  
Building up 2 or 3 walls high to deploy the Glider is no problem, because you always can enable the glider before you are taking fall damage, which applies on the height of 3+ walls. At the current state of the game, there is zero risk in just building ramps as high as you want, unlike it was, when you had to use the Jump Pad. You always took a risk when you were building 3+ walls high and then had to place the Pad, because the higher you got, the more visible you were to enemies and the higher the risk was, to get shot down. Also the risk to get shot down became higher if you just used ramps instead of more structures, like ramp, floor, wall.  
All these previous elements you had to take in consideration when building a Jump Pad can be applied to the Re-deployable Glider, if the minimum deploying-height is around 10 walls or even higher. If the player gets shot down before he reaches the 10 wall height, he takes fall damage and will die. The player would have to think about reenforcing his ramps and would also have to use more materials overall (see above).  

* **The Jump Pad could still be valid**  
By using 10 walls as deploy-height, the Jump Pad would still be a reasonable asset to  the game. If the player doesn't need to go up 10 walls high to use the Glider (maybe because of the zone size, or the risk of enemies nearby, a loot drop in sight and so on..) he can use the Jump Pad. So if he just goes up 7 walls, he can't use the Re-deployable Glider, but instead can place a Jump Pad to use the Glider. So, by reajusting the deploy-height to 10 walls or higher, the Jump Pad could still stay in the game, because there can be situations where it is still smarter to use the Pad instead of the Re-deployable Glider.  

* **Players have to decide how high they wanna go in build fights**  
Since building is a key element in Fortnite, managing your ressources has become one of the most important parts of the game. Sure, you will always be able to farm or get loot from your enemy, but at the moment of a build fight, this is all neglectable. Imagine two players on the same skill level of building are fighting each other. If the deploy-height would still be 2 walls, they wouldn't care about how high this fight goes, because they know, they can always use the Glider to avoid fall damage, no matter what. They would build higher and higher, just for the sake of high-ground. But if the deploy-height would be 10 walls, the players would have to watch their height way more carefully and can't just build blindly upwards, because inbetween wall-height 4 and 10, there is the chance that their build will get shot down and they will die to fall damage. This makes build fights even more tactical, since the players not only have to care about if they have enough materials, but also if they are below or on the height of 3 walls or if they are higher than 10 walls. This would enable players to still not only go for high ground, but to actually drop down and try to knock down the enemy tower. This mechanic is used often, because it saves materials and ends a fight quickly. But at the moment, this mechanic is useless, due to the always deployable Glider height. With increasing that height, the ""drop-down and knock down the build""-mechanic is valid again.   
Also, if a player tries to just get to the 10 walls height as quickly as possible and the other player stays low, the player above can't use a shotgun or SMG effectivly on his opponent. It would force the players to use Assault Rifles or a sniper to deal a good amount of damage. When a player is very good at ARs he know has two ways to tactically lure his opponent into using them in a build fight, which usually ends with SMG sprays and Shotgun shots. But this is just my theory and I think, in reality, both will try to build fight each other, no matter which height they are on. Still, having a deadzone, where you can die to fall damage would be better than having to fall damage at all.

**Final thoughts**

I think we can all agree, that having zero fall damage doesn't contribute to the game at all. There must be a risk at build fighting. Also, chasing players who just build ramps and fly away is frustrating as hell, especially if you would outbuild them easily. With increasing deploy-height, players wouldn't be able to run away as easy. They would have to build up 10 walls and a chasing player can easily knock them down before they reach that height. I think it would overall contribute to the game if the height of the Re-deployable Glider would be increased. Also, it would make Jump Pads valuable again. Players could still benefit from the Re-deployable Gliders, when they are willing to take the risk of building high.  
I would like to hear your thoughts about it.

I know I'm not the only one who feels this way and I know there are tons of people who choose not to play fortnite for this reason.

I know I know, I'm going to get a influx of negativity and downvotes but common, hear me out. 

As is now gunplay almost doesn't matter, If you can build amazingly it pretty much makes you a badass at the game. But not everyone has the dexterity and muscle memory to do this. I've been practicing for months and I still can't do the quick flick circle people do to build ultra fast.

Personally and I've talked to quite a few people who actually agreed with this suggestion. So please think about it and don't automatically hate and be toxic. I want this to be a good discussion.

How about limiting resources down to say 200 of each wood, metal and stone. I feel like this would actually balance the game play a lot which would bring gun play skills up to par. Players would have to think more wisely about how to use their resources instead of turtle building Into into sky in a massive fortress. It would bring the two skills closer together and bring about a skill balance.

I also feel like this would actually bring more players back to the game who were frustrated over the unbalance between the build and gunplay mechanics.

I also had another person I suggested this too say that he also likes the idea, but feels they should take out turbo building along with it and make people click each piece seperate.

Goodbye Fortnite.

It's been over a year and I have to move on. I'm committed, already factory reset my PC and I'll be selling it, the same PC I built solely for Fortnite. This game is too addicting and I have to face the harsh reality I could be bettering my life far and above the extent Fortnite does, which is minimal. I wasn't a pro but wasn't too bad either, ign Plump Plumper if you're curious. Messed around in duos with my younger brother a lot and reconnected with old friends I've since hung out with irl when I otherwise wouldn't have.  Too many good memories, hundreds spent on this game and I don't regret it, starting on Xbox, moving to PC, taking my entire PC setup to my friends apartment acting like it was LAN Halo 2 days lol...

In the end I must admit to myself Fortnite is hindering me more than helping me. I didn't think it would be this hard but I believe that's evidence of the control this game has/had on me. Bittersweet. Sometimes I think, ""Yea but what if I won like Tfue or Poach..."" Even if I did that's not genuinely the life I want to live when I think about who I am. Ha, especially because I'm not even winning. Wasting away... Borderline loser. Too harsh? idk

No one likes to hit 7 damage with a pump headshot, much less 3 5 damage shots with a tac. My idea is that headshots should add on to the maximum body shot damage. For example, instead of hitting a 7 damage with a blue pump, you would hit for 92. The maximum damage amount would stay the same (ex. 192 for gold heavy, 170 for blue pump). 

This would only apply in the range where you can hit a max damage headshot( longer range for heavy and pump, shorter with tac and shortest for double barrel, same as now). If epic wont bring back double shotgun or one pumps, please do this so that shotguns do more consistent damage. I feel like this is the best way to make the tac shotgun relevant again, since pump smg will almost always beat tac in close range fights with similar skill levels. 

Let me know your thoughts on this idea. ",FortNiteBR

Soaring should make you vulnerable, otherwise you can't punish people who just build recklessly.  If I break your tower and force you to soar your punishment should be vulnerability which forces you to retreat away from me, giving up your area control.

IMO, what soaring needs is landing cooldown.
2 or so seconds where you can't build.
and several seconds where you can't shoot.

But you'd still be able to pickaxe, heal and use other items. So it wouldn't be as if you're unable to still play.

It´s really frustrating to be in a fight with someone just to get totally overrun by zombies, and, when it happens to my enemy, it´s also bad, i am not beating him because i am better, i am beating him because some NPCs decided to attack him, and not me, and this makes for some VERY boring fights, where i would just spam AR bullets onto my enemy´s builds while he gets totally rekt by zombies. I can say, i am not GOOD at fortnite, but i´ve played since season 3, and i can say that the zombies are ruining the Battle Royale experience. They should be changed, to not have such an effect on battles, and also, give less loot, because people now spend the whole game killing zombies to get good stuff. In my opinion, zombies should only be found on the corrupted areas, and VERY rarely outside of one. The sheer quantity of zombies in one game is overwhelming, especially at the end, when it gets almost impossible to get the high ground, because there will be zombies behind you and enemies shooting from up above, getting you in a tough spot. In conclusion, i don´t think that zombies should be removed for a while, i think they need to be changed, by: Reducing the amount of zombies that can be found outside the corrupted areas; Reduce the zombie´s damage to buildings and their ""detection range"", with that, one player can fight and escape from zombies; Make zombies drop less stuff, and the things that can be found by destroying one of the BIG zombie spawners better, causing players to stay less time farming zombies, encouraging them to destroy their spawn point as quickly as possible.",FortNiteBR

I like the increased loot and fast paced fights of blitz and now when i go back to regular everything just feels so much slower. By the time the first circle forms in regular solos there is usually about 35-40 people left and a huge circle just makes for running around and sparse gunfights. Blitz is just overall more appealing to me and I hope Epic does something to keep it around for a while.,FortNiteBR

* setting up a trap
* destroying someone's cover when they're distracted
* throwing it chaotically at the enemy and hoping that it'll do some damage, because it's your only weapon and you don't want to start a match again, it'll also slightlydamage your stats, and... you're dead

But if we could stick it to others? Duuude...

Throw it at your teammate, and you can help him during shotgun duel by detonating it. Or give him a launchpad and send to enemy tower, then detonate.

Throw it above and let it land on you, and you can kamikaze when situation is dire.

Throw it at some unsuspecting enemy and escape, then wait for the right moment to explode him, thinking about his panic in delight.

Throw it at downed enemy and wreck his healer's HP with a mighty boom.

It gives more uses to otherwise underused item and makes game more tactical. Would it encourage trolling? Only if you perceive perfectly legit tactic this way.

Edit: I think it'd be fair only if it would adhere exclusively to torso, we don't want it to be OP, right?",FortNiteBR

Take to the skies is basically battle royale, except the storm comes from the bottom, forcing you to build up.

**Changes:**  
 - Materials are doubled  
 - Supply Drops drop every 30 seconds   
 - Llamas now float from the sky every minute like supply drops in the form of [unicorns] (https://d3d8f08i0s41kz.cloudfront.net/T_Brite_L.png)  
 - Rockets cannot be found in ammo boxes. Rockets are reduced to 5 from llamas. This will make rockets very valuable.  
 - Light bullets are halved, however llama lights are doubled, making SMGs and Miniguns very 
valuable.  
 - The storm shrinks inward slower, however it rises up faster.  
 - There is a 3 minute window at the start to gather materials.  
 - Launch pad drop is tripled.  
 - *optional: pvp is disabled at the start*  

**Why?**  
 - Materials are doubled so that people can get materials for foundations to build up on easier.  
 - Supply drops are more frequent as, in the sky, they will be the main source of stuff.  
 - Llamas floating down will have the same effect as supply drops, they will be fought over for materials.  
 - RPG Launchers and Grenade Launchers will be very powerful for destroying foundations, so I have made rockets scarce to give llamas more value.  
 - Miniguns and SMGs will be powerful, so I have done this to stop foundations from being 'insta-teared' at the start.  
 - I have done this so that people don't have to rebuild every 3 minutes, instead just build up.
 - Needed for foundations.  
 - Launch pads will be essential in the game.  

**Why? #2**  
I think this gamemode will encourage huge buildings, fights over supply drops and llamas, and just generally more skilled fights. People with RPGs will be greatly targeted too.

Please read before downvote.,"TL:DR Directive system for guns to reward skins for X amount of kills for the said weapon and also at the same time fix the problem of not having anything real to grind for.


Now, I know this post is gonna get down voted to shit because people think I hate Fortnite. Wrong. Absolutely love this game. Best fun I've had in a game in a long long while now. Thank you Epic for this. 

But, as of right now at least, the game doesn't reward you all that well for just playing it. Sure, there's Weekly and Daily challenges that'll get you to come back, well, weekly and daily. Which is a wonderful system. But what then, when the challenges are done? Sure, going for as many wins and raising a number is fun to some, but for the other who enjoy the gameplay and not going for wins or kills is their main goal it isn't. Basically nothing but Rust Lords dancing away. 

But on the real though, right now, playing during the ""challenge downtime"" is really worth nothing. XP gain is low just from killing people or winning games and playing overall is quite ""stale"" if you're not clenching you ass cheeks trying to crossbow someone.

My idea to fix this is to add a sort of ""Directive"" system, which would work like this: You get weapon specific challenges which may take some time to do, like, lets say:

* M16  Tier 1 *Get 150 kills for Bronze Skin.*
           Tier 2 *Get 300 kills for Silver Skin*
           Tier 3 *Get 500 kills for Gold Skin*
           Final Tier *Get 1000 kills for Platinum Skin.*

So on and so forth, explains the basic idea of how it'd work.

This kind of systems could be implemented when the inevitable release of weapon skins come, not saying weapon skins coming is a bad idea. Absolutely fucking not. More skins please. ",FortNiteBR

this mode has also made me hate the extremely low amount of material you get in the default mode,some extremely large trees only give 30-35 wood whereas some give 60. the small trees give 9-15 for 3 hits which is absolutely bs.imo up the material gained from all sources by at least 40% and actually balance the smaller trees so that they give more mats, theres nothing more annoying dying to a bad player purely because you have just had a huge building fight and are now 0 0 0 on mats. sorry rant over. just was thinking if anyone was thinking in the same way",FortNiteBR

The new shooting model will not be the first-shot accuracy, nor will it be the Perfect Accuracy w/ Recoil. We can expect something very... Different:

Announcement:

Beginning 03/29/2018 we will be rolling out our newest update, and as you all know, we expect it to be quite large, and controversial. As employees of Epic Games you are sworn to adhere to our code of conduct and ethics policies when interacting with both paying and non-paying customers. The upcoming update will undoubtedly cause a storm (pun intended) of responses, some will be positive and some will be negative; you are to handle each individual's feedback personally and as if you submitted the form yourself. 

Below we have attached a few go-to responses for some of the feedback we expect, if you get stumped. This should not be your initial response to feedback however, but as a last resort!

Shooting Model Details:

Assault Rifles: Initial damage increased by 25% across the board to a distance of 25 Meters. After 25 Meters, damage drop-off begins to occur at a rate of 10% per 5 Meters, to a maximum of 50%. Once the magazine is missing ammunition, the rifle will begin to fire more erratically, this increases based upon how low on Ammunition you are. As the rifle begins to fire ""erratically"" you can expect a 5% chance per ammunition missing to instead inflict headshot damage upon yourself.

Sniper Rifles (to include the Crossbow and Hunting Rifle): Sniper Rifle damage decreased by 95% across the board. Headshot damage increased to 500, all Sniper Rifles function the exact same, Crossbows and Hunting Rifles are now purely aesthetic differences. Inflicting a body-shot, or damaging a structure, instantly deals headshot damage to your nearest ally, at a maximum distance of 500 Meters, to prevent intentional team killing, the damage will not reach allies further than 500 Meters.

Pistols &amp; SMGs: Damage remains unchanged. Each shot has a 50% chance to Critically Strike (remains capable of headshots.) Critically striking an Enemy causes 2x the damage, and inflicts 250 damage on all structures within a 2-tile radius of the shooter.

Shotguns: Pellet spread remains controlled largely by bloom, however, for each pellet missed on a target within your aiming box causes the shooter to take headshot damage, per pellet that misses, and healing the target for the same amount, if the target is full health, shields are applied.

Explosives: All explosives have a chance to backfire, causing the shooter to instead take all damage that would have been dealt to enemies, and dazing the shooter for 10 seconds, while dazed the player may still emote and trigger emoticons, though movement, weapon controls and building capabilities are lost during this time. Firing an explosive weapon within 30 seconds of having been dazed triggers this effect with a 100% guarantee.

Traps: Traps work (largely) as they do currently, though to add flair to them, there is a potential component for each:
Launch Pads: Allied Players jumping on the launch pad, have a 75% chance to have their glider/umbrella not trigger.
Cozy Campfire: Allied Players have a 25% chance per tick of healing received to take 35 damage, this damage applies to Health, and cannot be absorbed by shields.
Retractable Spike Traps: Every .5 seconds, the Trap may randomly trigger, damaging all players within the damage distance, friendly and enemy.

Buildings: Structures now place with a variable amount of maximum health:
Wooden: 25 HP Minimum, 200 HP Maximum.
Stone: 25 HP Minimum, 250 HP Maximum.
Metal: 25 HP Minimum, 300 HP Maximum.

Furthermore, If 3 structures are placed, with less than 50% of their maximum health, all structures placed by the player will immediately be removed, and building disabled for 10 seconds.

Our research team has determined that the current degree of RNG within the game is not enough to limit the skill-gap, though we feel these changes will assist in that, if we need to implement further methods, we will do so.

Go-To responses regarding changes:

Assault Rifles: ""It is possible a shell went in your eye as the casing was ejected, stuff sorta happens sometime, but we feel this will make the game more fun.""

Sniper Rifles: ""Previously, Sniper Rifles were great in the hands of some players, and useless in the hands of others. These changes help to bridge that gap.""

Pistols &amp; SMGs: ""We felt that the previous iteration was not enough of a risk/reward for pistols and SMGs, we also found that they were often seen as the ""Boring"" choice, we hope these changes will fix that.""

Shotguns: ""Previously Shotguns were quite strong, potentially one-shotting a player, or at the same time dealing little (or no) damage. Now, we felt that the degree of variants with those potential results was not enough, and feel that this is at the very least, a step closer to what we are aiming for.""

Traps: ""Having a Trap in real life has the potential to back-fire, so we wanted to make this aspect as realistic as possible.""

Building: ""The cornerstone of a good player was their ability to participate in the ""Build-Off"" or ""Build-Battle"" and we want this to be a feature in the game, though we feel that there should be some risk to building. Currently the ability to build-structures instantly is too easy, and has no risk attached, these changes correct this.""

We feel that the above responses will go over well with our player-base, and after a couple of weeks they will all come around to the new mechanics. Bloom was a good placeholder, but we feel more randomness, and control tossed to fate will ultimately make the game better, and more competitive. After-all, who wants to watch someone practice, improve and dominate? Each player should have an equal chance of winning, at all times.

Hello world, I have a question and I'm very sorry to bother with this... I am currently in the tier 23 of the free battle pass, right? Well, if I buy the Battle pass today, I will receive all the rewards that I lost from Tier 1 to 23? or start on Tier 1 with the Battle Pass and the free battle Pass will continue in 23? 

Sorry again, I am new to fornite and also in the community. Know how to apologize if my English is not perfect either. Thank you",FortNiteBR

 If someone wants to spend $20 or $200 for 10 skins, that's his/hers choice and you don't need to be ""triggered"". It's cringey.

 If someone wants to use Take the L using a rust lord skin for 10 minutes straight, let him. This is a game and you need to get out your feelings and not get ""triggered"" at it for being ""toxic""

Stop using the downvote button as a disagree button. You make people who care about karma afraid to voice their opinions, learn to accept that others see things differently from you.

Stop complaining about everything.. for example this new shotgun being ""too OP!"" give it time before jumping to conclusions.

Stop this PC vs Console nonsense, idk how this even became a thing but theres no statistic / solid proof to show that people on PC are less toxic or vice versa, it's actually ridiculous that people actually fight over this.

Stop hating on good players just because you're trash yourself, trust me hating on a good player wont make you better, just makes you seem like a jealous idiot and no one likes a jealous idiot.

Everyone plays it, everyone talks about it, bragging about all their epic tales of glory.

Except me. I'm sure there are many others that haven't won this game as well. Some in much more attempts than me.
But if you don't win a single solo game in 274 attempts, what do you think you're going to feel? Optimistic? Sad? Depressed?

Angry at all the friends that rub it in your face?

Distraught at the literal 11 year olds that have the time and dedication to get better?

Now I know, without a doubt, that I made a huge mistake when I decided to first talk about my failures. Cause once you have, you can't just ""unsay"" it. 
All your friends will know how much you suck at this game, and they will never relent.

So I could just quit this game and never look back. I could just play other, less frustrating games, and be happy.
But I know that eventually, someday, I will win. I can finally scream with ecstasy and be happy with the game for once.
So I keep playing. Every loss bites my neck like a viper's toxin, slowly filling me with rage and sadness. I plead with the game to give a win, just one glimmer of happiness.

But it never comes.

As the pros get wins like it means nothing, I've never wanted something more in my entire life. My motivation goes to the bipolar extremes.

I. *need.* a win.

This is addiction. After losing once, twice, 274 times, I'm making up the sunk costs of my sanity. But my friends don't care. 

No one does.",FortNiteBR

It gets a bit irritating but I think if you kept the different aspect for materials from Blitz after that mode is removed it would make the game ten times more fun and thrilling.

I've played maybe 10 matches so far and I feel like I'm handicapped severely. Especially with building. I watch a few streamers, and they have a tower built while I would still be fiddling with the menu.

Part of the problem is I have so little experience with shooter-type games, especially shooters against **other people**. 

I've searched though all the new player tips, and the consensus seems to be: to git gud, play and keep playing. I'll do that. I've gotten as high as 11th so far, but only by hiding tbh. I have exactly one kill to my credit and that felt like dumb luck. 

But I have a couple questions/suggestions: 

* What about a 'practice' area where a new player can just get familiar with the controls? It's hard for me to learn when I feel the icy hands of death on my shoulder.

* I get how the contracting storm forces gameplay to a climax. But I think it would be cool to have a couple of different options. For example, a mode where the whole map is open and stays open. These would be LONG games. But I like that idea. Another idea: in the movie ""Battle Royale,"" the island is divided into a grid and every so often a grid would become an instant death zone if you didn't vacate quickly. I think that would be an interesting balance between a long game and slow game. 

* Un-building: I usually keep watching the people that kill me. Just this morning I watched a player built a high tower, then seemingly **unbuild** that stairs underneath him/her very quickly and easily. I can't figure out how to do that. I would have to axe my way down if I wanted out of a high tower.

Any other tips/suggestions for an old newbie would be appreciated. ",FortNiteBR

This makes for janky shooting, and fail pumps.","TLDR; Pump Shotgun's animation is not accurarely synced with the actual time you can shoot. It takes a long and crucial time before you can shoot after the animation has completed. **Sync the actual shoot time with the animation.**


1. The Pump's animation is not Synced with the actual Shoot Time after ""pumping.""

2. I'm not complaining about the Pump Nerf.

3. This causes you to either fail to pump your shell, causing you to do the animation again, or not get your shotgun-shells to shoot when the animation is completed. You have to wait a long while (1 or 1.5 seconds) AFTER the animation has completed before you shoot. This doesn't count for all the wasted time if you fail to reload.

4. **No, this will not bring ""Double-Pump"" back**. If this was fixed, you still have to pump your shell before shooting. It's the time after the animation which is too long and not-synced with the Pump-Animation which makes you wait after for an additional 1-1.5 seconds before you can shoot. You would think you'd be able to shoot after the animation has completed. 1-1.5 seconds is a long time after the already long animation that countered ""Double-Pump."" This desync causes crucial time during very fast fights which could determine if you Win or Lose.

I'm not here to listen to ignorant and stupid comments, that I have already addressed in my post. **Please read fully, and test it yourself. Shoot the pump, and keep clicking your Shoot-Button whilst it's reloading.** You'll see the non-accurate animation which lies to you about the actual time you can shoot.

Honestly, I watched them, they seemed like mobile players. One guy built in to the storm. And as I was building up one guy got a lucky snipe off on me and took 200 HEALTH off me, killing me. This is the guy who subsequently couldn't build himself out of the storm quick enough (i.e, he was a dumbass). The last two didn't even build and had a shotgun 1v1 on an open plain. How can anyone tell me I didnt deserve to win that game? 

How can you tell me that a sniper should be able to take off 200 health. How can you tell me it takes skill when it really doesn't. 

You tell me to stand still to counter the bloom when I have an AR, but then it's easy to be sniped. But if I moved around to avoid snipers I get punished by the bloom when I shoot.

And when we're base hiding, sniping someone else in a base is not skill as someone in their base is moving side to side arbitrarily, meaning any sniper shot is just luck. 

And let's not forget the exploit that they can knock off the top of their wall to see through and meerkat up for a cheap shot. 

I'm telling you now. Snipers ruin the game. They can dictate end game so easily. They're broken. Change my mind, I dare you.

I’m certainly not a pro but I definitely have some experience

Late game squads in fortnite consistently seems to turn into a contest of who can shoot out more rockets than the other team. People on team A shoot rockets at team B while a couple people on team A push team B. Team B is largely unable to build, and if the sides are even then team A will most likely win.

Players who are extremely good at building can sometimes build so quick the effects of the rockets can be mitigated however I would argue that most players are unable to do this. 

The best and most exiting games of squads are played when both team have little to no rockets and need to rely on the their aim, teammate work, and building to successfully push and kill an enemy team and win, not when both teams hide in their forts lobbing rockets at each other.

Squads is still my favorite game mode as I just really love playing with friends and having a good team with them. I’m not saying this happens every game I’m just saying it happens a little too frequently.

Whenever I use this skin, I always worry that I can be very easily be spotted from far away, and that shouldn’t be a feeling someone should get from such a nice skin.

My suggestion on how to fix the problem is to not change the colors for the user and the user’s teammates, but to just mute the colors to all the opponents in their match.

personally, the game came at a good time. while poorly received, i had a blast with eas battlefront from 2015. it had its flaws but it was a blast and pretty to look at. the new one sucks, fifa got old to me, 2k and madden are just roster updates at this point. gran turismo focused more on online challenges and different things, pared down their list of total cars in a major way and it just wasn’t the same for me as far as enjoyment and play time go compared to the last iteration.

fortnite saves the day for me at this point. it’s exclusively the only game i play now. i can go for hours. i always joke that good or bad round, my ‘last one’ turns into ‘okay one more,’ an hour or two later despite how well or poorly i did.

solo squads is the most fun challenge i’ve ever received in a game. it adds a layer of stealth to the game. the mental chess match you have in facing teams of 2 - 4 is exhilarating; especially when you are hitting on all cylinders.

building as an in game mechanic is new to me, and to most. my reaction time is in the top tier of players but i am slowly and steadily improving my building game. i have never had this much fun. every game is the same in theory but vastly different and unique in application/real time.

i don’t have many gripes thus far but here are the changes i wish to see:

• server expansion (or whatever would alleviate some of this lag): they are making money with the battle passes, skins, etc... time to beef up the servers so we can have better stability on console, because at times it gets pretty wonky when you try to drop in and get a semi-hard freeze and then rubberband around a building or land for a brief moment and then are downed/dead when you accidentally fall off a building you meant to just fly over.

• let us swap the heads from certain skin models from one to another, much like the back bling.

• let us rearrange the order of the building pieces on console/in general.

• allow for fully mappable button layouts on console to however we see fit.

• increase the floor spawns of weapons, chests and ammo buckets between the levels they are raised to in blitz and the base game. same with launch pads, drops and the time it takes for the circles to move.

• make it so that anywhere on the map that has a cash register, you can go up to it and hit your action button and collect between 1 and 5 vbucks. would be a fun addition to the game that would basically in no way harm any sales but still give us an easy way to farm vbucks while playing to buy skins with without having to slave away in stw mode, because it isn’t nearly as fun as br.

• fix party chat so we don’t have to create our own parties to be able to talk between rounds/loading screens.

• display a number value of x/x pellets when we hit with shotguns next to the damage model so we know how many hit so there is less whining about the inconsistency with the shotguns.

• place “knocked down” or “eliminated x player” texts off to the side, as well as storm updates so that they don’t block the main screen view.

• fix some of the areas along ledges and cliffs or even hills that should allow you to run up the slope but instead you slide back down even though the texture is mapped such that it should let you continue running.

• display our emblem/banner on our arm instead of that placeholder tattoo.

• decrease the time you have to wait to finish off a downed player.

• change the map view so that if you wish to play with hud off that pulling up your minimap will display your health/shield levels, loadout and materials/traps stockpile/inventory.

• make the jump button pressure sensitive so you can tap it to jump through areas that require you to exhaust your jumping to be able to jump low enough to clear. ie windows in tilted towers in some buildings, awnings, counters... etc.

• put a silenced rifle in the game as a weapon, less accuracy at range, 4 less dp than the m16, but legendary and epic rarities since the m16 stops at blue.

• give us the option to turn off the audio that comes with some of the dances, id rather be able to clown on people right behind them than give myself away.

• give us the option after a death/victory to hit a button and be slotted into the next lobby and skip the home screen altogether.

• reduce the bloom effects by 15% on all ranged weapons.

RT=Ramp

LB= Floor

RB= Roof

B= build mode/cancel build/cancel build mode

Dpad= change material (was LT)

The update where Fortnite added auto switch materials has opened the door for console key bindings. Since you no longer need to switch materials in combat that allows change materials to go to a less accessible button in order to make room for their this scheme.

Players will be given 2 options on how to lay the piece.
•quick build
•normal build

quick build-This is the fastest option for skilled players. players would enter build mode like normal by hitting B. once in build mode simply pressing LT would bring up the hologram to indicate where the wall would be and releasing it would place the piece. so for example to build a wall with a ramp on it normally you would have to hit B,Rt,RB, RB, Rt. with this scheme you would only have to hit B, LT, RT. 

normal build- this is a slower option that still gives an advantage to less skilled players. players would enter build mode like normal. once in build mode the player would have to hit Rt twice to build a ramp. from there the hologram would stay up and any additional times they hit the button it would build. to switch piece they would just hit the new corresponding piece to bring up the hologram and one additional time to place it.

By adding apecific key bindings this drastically reduces the amount of key strokes a player has to do hit to build. Keep in mind everytime you switch from building wall to ramp you have to hit 2 more buttons with the current scheme than the purposed control scheme. So in a fight were you have switch from wall to ramp 10 times you have hit 20 more buttons to build the same thing. This lack of efficiency is the reason PC players can build so much faster. the physically have to hit less buttons to do the same thing. 

I challenge you to think of a situation where the current scheme is more efficient than the purposed scheme. The first person to prove the  standard combat pro building is more efficient than my new purposed scheme will get a prize.

At this point in the game’s life-cycle, shields might as well be glass, with single bullets wiping out 200 health (100 shield, plus 100 of life) in seconds.


The damage output, for one, is unbalanced, no matter what people say; bullets will clear shield and health in seconds, while other times the same scenario will see bullets doing a little of damage. What gives? But if shields were significantly buffed, then that damage output wouldn’t bother me so much - even if it does.


Shields are essential parts of the game, and when you finally get one (or two), you feel like they should *matter* - but their role of saving our asses, and giving us a small chance of living, isn’t what’s happening. They aren’t doing their job well enough, and all the effort of finding them goes out the window when a single bullet decimates the entire thing in one go, killing you and leaving you feel underwhelmed.


What is even the point in going through so much hassle getting a shield just for you to die instantly as if you didn’t even have one?


They need a more significant role in giving us that second chance, and should be buffed in a way that gives us one but not making it feel as if the shield is protecting the person *too much*. That’s where I see it. You want to buff shields enough that they matter, but not so much that they protect the player from so much.


I’m not expecting everyone to agree here, but I just had to share my opinion on the matter. What are your thoughts on shields? I’m interested in what everyone feels about them.


**TLDR** I feel like shields should be a little stronger, but obviously not so strong they are going to turn people into bullet sponges. 

**Edit:** I’m basing this on the 50 shield potions, which I feel once you get them, they should withstand most of the damage you take. The mini-shields are so frequent they wouldn’t need buffed. ",FortNiteBR

You know, that sweet sweet reverse cosmopsychology. I also want to do something to give back to the community. These skins are awesome and I think Epic should make them more accessible. What do you guys think? 

***RULES***

*Comment a number between 1 and 1000. 

*One entry per person. If you post multiple numbers with one account, you will be excluded from the giveaway.

*Winning number will be chosen via a random number generator. If the number rolled isn’t used by a commenter, I roll again until someone wins. 

*Ctrl-F to make sure your number hasn’t been chosen. If the winning number is used by more than one commenter, the person who posted it first wins.


*Don’t use alternate accounts. I can’t really enforce this one, but don’t be a dick. Simple. 


*I will PM the winner at approximately 7pm CST the day either of the aforementioned skins are placed in the shop for purchase. They will provide me with their PayPal where I can send them the money to buy the V-Bucks. If they don’t respond within 24 hours, I will select another winner. If one is put into the shop tonight and the other tomorrow, there will still be only one giveaway. 

*If neither skin is available in the shop tonight or tomorrow, no giveaway will happen. Game on Epic. 

Good luck everyone!

The key words here are THAT WEAPON. 

Some other double-switch strats that work just as well (if not more) as the double pump go as follows:

* Double revolver
* Double deagle
* Double RPG
* Double Heavy Shotgun
* Double Bolt (basically a bolt with 2 rounds where you only have to scope out for a split second)

And probably more.

There is a simple solution to this: Add weapon draw delay. It doesn't have to vary per gun, it just has to be enough so that it's no longer viable to have more than one of a single slow-firing gun in your inventory to make it shoot rapidly. 

If you fixed the double pump, why not these? Epic, you've done amazing things in the past, but these seem like a HUGE oversight.

When I first started playing, the gameplay seemed fun and there were a ton of people running and gunning. In the past week or so, it feels like most enemies that I'm running into are inside a building, house or hut camped up and waiting for someone to come to them or they wait until they hear the end of a gunfight and run out to clean up. Sometimes it's obvious (200 HP, 1 kill with 20 people remaining) and other times it's not, but it just seems like the gameplay has changed a bit. I know a massive influx of players recently joined and that could be it. The blitz mode has certainly helped as it goes against that style but when I go back to duos or  regular solo, I can't help but feel that most opponents are just held up somewhere and waiting to hear the end of the battle. Don't get me wrong, it's definitely a strategy and sometimes it works, but I was enjoying the gameplay more when players were out fighting and building instead of waiting in a house. 

Have you felt the same or am I crazy? I'm on Xbox One if it matters. ",FortNiteBR

The addition of the Heavy Shotgun has me thinking, “Do we really need the Pump Shotgun any more?”
 

My Case:  We know that the “Double-Pump” was a broken mechanic, but we never asked if the Pump Shotgun itself was broken.  We all love hitting that 200+ headshot, but is that really a mechanic we want in the game? Are we saying that hitting a relatively easy shot from 10 meters should be rewarded with the same damage output as a sniper shot from 200+ meters? 

My Solution:  I believe we need to part ways with the beloved Pump Shotgun and replace it with the Heavy Shotgun.  Reduce the rarity of the Heavy Shotgun to “Common” and “Uncommon” and have it spawn as floor loot.  The Heavy Shotgun is the perfect replacement for the Pump Shotgun because it has a tighter spread (slug), slightly lesser damage output (&lt;200), and a slightly increased fire rate (no more issues with random shooting delays, as observed with the Pump Shotgun).",FortNiteBR

I know you're being very tactical, with your sly V-buck trickery but I won't be fooled, because I see exactly what you're doing. Yeah that's right. You make the newest skins 1200 bucks, just out of range of the 1000 bucks for $15 option. Ha! Such a valiant jab at my subconscious, but even the fatigue of 50 second place finishes in one day would not entice me to reach into the depths of my PayPal account to pay for the next option, 2500 bucks for $38. Such a steep rise in bucks for an even steeper price, and I see straight through it. 

So, friends of r/FortNiteBR, I plea with you, take heed of my warning. There is a growing force in this game. This force is responsible for more L's than Dequan's double pump (RIP DDP) and it is to be avoided at at all ""costs"". It is the item store.

You have been warned. 


In all seriousness though, I am not saying to get rid of the currency, I understand that it is a free game and that V-bucks contribute to the betterment of the game. But for Christ's sake Epic, I currently have 1150 bucks, I shouldn't have to buy another 1000 bucks just to buy a 1200 buck item. Give me the option of buying smaller quantities of V-buckeroonies.

A minor issue I have with the game is playing squads or duos and either I get knocked or a teammate will get knocked. I know it is considered *”Bad Manners”* to kill a knocked player but in reality, that means nothing to most casual players or die hard players. 

I do not think you should be able to kill knocked players. The purpose of being knocked almost serves as a second life, if your team can kill the other team and revive you then you have another chance in the game. 

In the current state, this feature has some problems. Too many times will people kill a knocked player in the middle of a fight or while being shot at by your team. 

I understand that players may need ammo or resources and they may need them immediately in the fight, or they do not want the downed player to call out to the rest of their team where their location may be. 

**Thoughts on how this can be fixed.** In my opinion, I think an interesting feature would be that you cannot kill or shoot downed players. They should bleed out faster, and faster over time. This will make teams fight and push harder to save their downed teammate, and whichever team wins the battle will be allowed to revive their downed teammates. This allows for knocked players to get a “second life”.

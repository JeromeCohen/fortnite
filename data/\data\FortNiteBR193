I am considered to be a pretty high level player when it comes to Fortnite because I am on a top 10 team in champs league on FNPL. There are really some glaring mechanical issues with the game especially on a competitive level that I want to address and discuss to see where the community and developers actually stand.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Out healthing opponents**  
This use to be such a major problem with the game that they fixed it with minis and slurps. It was working great until season 5. Now that the shotgun is much weaker and people rely much heavier on SMG's to do a majority of their damage having more hp than the enemy is more important than having better aim. This is extremely apparent by the tactic used by most players when they know someone doesn't have shield. Just hold M1+W into their build, yes I do this too. Winning a fight while you have no shields will really only happen if they person you are fighting is just bad at the game or chokes. Taking damage in a season 6 fight is almost unavoidable unlike in season 3 because you only had to hit 2 quick pump shots to kill. Now that fights take longer on average and bloom guns being required in a loadout; out healthing people has become normal again. This retracts from the games skill ceiling and lets RNG dictate whether you should even fight someone. Maybe shield drop rates need to be increased to balance this out since they clearly have no intent of making shotguns as useful as they once were.
2. **Movement items**  
There are simply too many movement enhancing items in the game that are far too strong. Fortnite is naturally fast paced compared to all other BRs, but after having rifts, grapplers, bounce pads, and shockwaves the game feels snail paced unless I am blessed to have one of these items. Having very high movement is the best advantage someone can have yet when taking any of these items give you no real disadvantage. At least with impulses you had to worry about taking fall damage. Along with having all these items the early game storm means nothing. When you rotate or how you rotate is something you rarely have to consider unless zone is across the map.
3. **Ammo Capacity**  
All max ammo needs to be nerfed. It's absolutely abhorrent with the current meta that 1 person can carry 1000 bullets. It is essentially endless and mindless pressure than can be applied with no real drawbacks. Why not encourage more thoughtful methods of spraying. Ammo caps need to be reduced drastically so someone can't just hold M1 because it's the only way they know how to be useful. If you're going to use a lot of bullets to suppress someone, you should have to worry about running out and whether it is a good time to suppress someone or not.
4. **Material Gain**  
It's too damn low and I always end up using at least 300-400 mats per fight because people just spray their near infinite ammo supply, then when I loot the people I get like 30 mats to replace it and end up having to farm for another 5 minutes just so I can use all my mats in 20 seconds for the next fight. Plus with all of the movement items getting 3rd partied happens almost every fight which uses up exponentially more mats. Early game fights would be much less RNG if material gain were increased.
5. **New items and server issues**  
Listen, the servers have been just awful lately and everyone knows it. The game's fps is getting lower and lower as it becomes harder to optimize the game/servers with new vehicles and items. Please don't add more vehicles because the servers can't even handle what we have right now. I use to almost never have a shotgun shot do 0 damage but these past few weeks it happens on the daily. Especially late game in scrims and the skirmish, it is just an unplayable mess of 'maybe we will win.' If you're going to keep adding new items at least stop forcing us to be in games with them. Add a separate mode for new items so you aren't messing with the competitive scene, forcing us to adapt our play styles and come up with new strategies that will be obsolete when the inevitable vaulting of said poorly thought out item happens.
6. **Floor loot**  
Stop spawning ammo and mats on the floor. There is literally no reason to have those spawn on the floor when ammo boxes exist and you can break literally everything for mats. All it does for the game is give more ammo for people to mindlessly spam with and give people less of a chance to get a gun off spawn.

There is probably more I could list but I want to keep the discussion a little focused on the core/general mechanics of the game instead of an item itself.  
Do you agree or disagree with me and why? What problems do you think the game-play currently has that should be fixed?

20,loganb3171,1539293249,9ne4lg,127,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9ne4lg/school_fortnite_tournament/,1,School Fortnite Tournament," Hey! I'm on my school's student council and I brought the idea up of having a fundraiser while a hundred students or more play Fortnite on a certain day after school. Just to clarify; since cross-play has become a thing, (in my opinion) the reasoning for ""why not"" has dropped drastically. I've been thinking of ways for this tournament to take place, and to have a crowned school champion. I believe that since custom-matchmaking is in the game, and that is what the skirmishes are played on, this could be an option for having this tournament. Students could possibly bring in their own PC/console and a monitor/television to play on. Internet access at my school is no problem, neither is spacing. I think that this would be a really fun event that could happen.  


What I'm really wanting to know is how I could contact EPIC to organize a key-code. I'm also wondering if anything like this has been done before in any other schools, whether it be in Fortnite or any other game so that I can base my ideas on a prior event.   


Any feedback is appreciated :) Thank you. ",FortNiteBR

Feel like Epic should support those who played even when the game was in its most unfinished state. What did i get from playing for so long? A banner and a glider? There’s gotta be something more. Even giving access to the purple skull trooper would be enough of a reward.

I can understand frustrations of people who don't like how it feels, or who don't like to use that mouse specifically but what if you physically are unable to use it to begin with?  


A brief summary of myself, I'm Leffty, a competitive Fortnite player and an advocate for the disabled gaming community who had plans to go to twitch con to experience both the event and the competition that Epic Games is holding. I've had to cancel these plans because of my physical condition which is that i'm partially missing my right hand. I was born with a stump on my right hand however I don't let it stop me from trying to play at the highest of levels.  


The requirement of specific peripherals is in fact discriminatory to the disabled gaming community and that community is in the right to file a complaint under the Americans with Disabilities (ADA).   
 

*Sec. 12113. Defenses*

*(a) In general*

*It may be a defense to a charge of discrimination under this chapter that an alleged application of qualification standards, tests, or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has been shown to be job- related and consistent with business necessity, and such performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation, as required under this subchapter.*

&amp;#x200B;

I wanted to bring this to everyone's attention because I believe in playing with not only works, but what feels best for you. I think that as a community we can agree that the requirements for specific peripherals should, at the very least, be looked at to be refined and changed. For example, players competing in the online fall skirmish have a Google form that they fill out. A similar form can be sent out OR signed at the event itself which gives players options between 2-3 mice to choose from. 

I believe these changes are necessary in further growing the competitive scene of Fortnite and allowing ANYONE with ANY disability the chance to compete and represent themselves.  

&amp;#x200B;

I believe this will help eliminate any frustrations and allow all players, like myself, the ability to play live at the event comfortably and effectively.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*Just as a small note\*\*\* 

My intention is to create discussion and change for not just disabled gamers but everyone who has a dream of playing in an Epic Games live event. I DO NOT wish to create any hatred towards Epic &amp; Fortnite. They are a fantastic group of people who are really doing us a big service by creating these events. I just think its unfair that the way I was born dictates my ability to compete as well",FortNiteBR

I instantly assumed this meant either skin from the Skull Squad set would come with the challenges. Like a lot of you, I bought Ranger and am now feeling let down.

Obviously, Epic trying to get people to buy both skins in a set is nothing new, but I have even less respect for this tactic when the ""missing piece"" isn't even mentioned in-game. 

The fact that they raised the price of Skull Trooper and made Ranger cheaper just adds insult to injury. I would have much rather paid 1500 to get Ranger plus the challenges and I think a lot of other people can say the same. It doesn't push me to buy more; it just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

At this point I believe I could compete in solo events and win. After the announcement of the Fall Skirmish weeks ago and hearing about the grand finale being at twitchcon, I assumed it was going to be like PAX West (an open solo tournament) so I purchased twitchcon tickets, booked hotels, rented a car, and bought plane tickets (I live in chicago). It's all i've been looking forward to the past couple of weeks and it's what has been motivating me to grind every single day, me wanting to place high in the grand finale. Now today we all learned that twitchcon in fact is a duos event, and i'm a solo player with no connections, and knows nobody in the scene. I don't think it's a smart idea to find a duo partner now and try to compete, because we would have very little chemistry and it's not worth going to potentially not even make it out of the qualifiers and it's not even a guarantee that we would get picked to play in the qualifiers at this point.

The point i'm trying to make is, I know it's not anyone at Epic's fault that I did what I did, and they probably had a reason why they didn't announce what kind of event was going to take place at twitchcon earlier, I'm just so beyond disappointed and heartbroken that I will not have an opportunity to show out in a solo event, and don't know when the next opportunity for me will come. I plan on trying to cancel all of my reservations and try to get a refund on everything i've purchased.

On a final note, I will continue to grind and I will continue to wait for my opportunity, but I would love to see some change on how announcements like these are handles, for people like me who have no connections, don't know anyone, and want to compete.

I need help.,"Ok, so, I used to mainly play Fortnite on the Switch, but due to the terrible FPS, I switched to PC. It has no lag, but godly players. Switch has slightly worse players. Since I'm pretty bad, it's become a huge problem. It is really affected me right now, since I'm doing the weekly challenges. Everyone keeps killing me on PC, and the lag gets me killed on Switch. I don't know what to do right now.

And before you say ""Get good"" or any getting better tips like going into Playground and training, just know that I'm not good at getting good too.

I had a bunch of extra stuff so I figured I'd leave it for you for when you got back.  You got back before I was done looting and we shared more stuff. I thought that would be the end if it.

You followed me, and when we got to the top of the ramp I wondered if you realized I was trying to signal a dance floor near us we needed. You got the hint and we jumped. When we landed, we had an argument and I shot at you at a few times. Honestly it was just a miscommunication; I'm not a psycho I promise. I thought you were running away from the dance floor and I just wanted you to come back.

You did, and we were victorious. Then the circle started to close and I realized we'd have to move to the center fight, and I got sad.

I got sad because I knew I'd lose you in all of those people. My new noskin friend who knows how to capture objectives and carries his cake around on his back like a badge of honor (it totally is). We built a ramp and at the top I tried to do a broken heart emote but I wasn't fast enough. You jumped and I thought it was over.

To my delight you aimed carefully and waited on the ground for me to follow you. I knew I had to do my emote when I landed so you'd see I would miss you. My stupid teammate decided to throw a grenade at us while we were crouched near a bush so I had to cancel my emote and shoot at him to tell him to shut it, I was obvs trying to have a conversation with my new BFF. Then I heard shots near us and realized we were out of time, so in a last ditch effort I took out the closest enemy and then danced, hoping you'd see my name on the kill text and add me to friends.

After that I lost you, so I just stayed around that ranger tower outside of salty springs, taking enemies out at range, hoping you'd come back.. but the fight must have carried you elsewhere.

One thing I noticed last season is that people could land at Junk/Motel/Lonely/Flush/Lucky without a problem because even if the circle was far, they could rift towards it. 

Now, since half of the rifts are gone - pretty much from everywhere that’s not the desert biome or viking village, people are forced to drop more populated areas OR levitating lake (so they can fly off towards the circle). And the game becomes wildly over saturated. We’re back to the season 4 days where 20-30 people will drop tilted in a game while last season was much more passive. 

Maybe it’s just me but, there’s way more people going to these high volume areas now and everybody gets condensed into one general area at the beginning of the game, effectively taking more than half the map out of play right from the start. 

Put rifts back to where they used to be - or bring back the tiki heads and the game will still be moving fast paced but it’ll also allow for people to properly loot up safely and not have to worry about dying immediately after 14 people rush them at a time. 

Please Epic, rifts were one of the best thing you’ve introduced to the game, I want to see more of them, not less. If you’re so concerned about all of these mobility items, just vault the grappler or shopping carts.

TL;DR rifts being slowly phased out sucks. No rifts = forcing people to drop populated areas so they don’t have to run a country mile to get to the circle. ",FortNiteBR

I was on 25 hp and playing defensively (so I didn’t use my grappler, would have got insta killed) but there’s no such thing as defence when theres an RPG about. This battle went on for literally 2 mins in the final circles because being a scrim player I could try and clutch it out but eventually one of my builds slipped and he put an RPG into my turtle.

Are they gonna get nerfed or is Epic gonna keep sucking off the bad players and reward RNG instead of skill? I would rather people have 1k RPGs but they only did damage to 1 structure and don’t have OP range like in season 2 and 3.",FortNiteBR

Additionally, you can also spam shots on a player somewhere in your reticle with ease and end up dealing significant damage (lucky headshot, etc.)

By adding a recoil to all weapons, you can no longer be rewarded by spamming (L-Click, R2, RT). However, if you learn the recoil mechanics you can hit a high rate of shots with the reduced Bloom.

In conclusion, I think implementing this change will reduce much of the spam aspect of the game, prevent much of the RNG aspect of shooting/getting shot, and giving a more rewarding bonus to skilled players who can understand the different gunplay systems.

My understanding is skewed on exactly who you're playing against when you're in a crossplay lobby, so I was wondering if there was anyone out there with a 100% clear understanding. I've googled it many times and am unable to find a single, comprehensive explanation anywhere, and everyone I talk to about it is in the same boat. 

My current understanding is that PC players are by default in crossplay lobbies. So a duo of two PC players could go up against a PS4 + PC, an Xbox + mobile, PS4 + Switch..etc. Is this correct? 
 
If that is correct, would it vary for mobile players? Or would two mobile players potentially play against two PC players, or PS4 + Switch.. etc. And would a solo Switch/mobile player play only against their platform? 

Now that Xbox and PS4 are cross compatible, does that mean when the two lobby up together they only play against Xbox and PS4 players, or are they thrown into the same ""PC"" crossplay lobby? 



Sorry for the hundred questions. Any clarification is much appreciated, and if there's a link that I somehow missed please let me know. Thanks.

Everyone liked the shotgun meta over the current spam meta and they refuse to change it back. So now it’s come to this:

Because all the noobs on this sub complained about shotguns, they got nerfed and ruined all the OG’s fun. So we’ve made it our personal to be the most toxic players ever and ruin the game you think is now fun. I will knock and full thirst you without even letting off the trigger. I will snipe you, reload, and snipe you again while you’re downed even if I have to take damage from your teammates to finish the job. I will third party every fight I see and kill all the knocked players first. I’m mad they took our bounce pads because I would knock players, box you up, place a pad on the floor and leave you bouncing forever until you left the game or bled out. If you knock and full kill my boy in duos, I’m thirsting one of you and leaving the game nearby so you can hear me leave just so you can’t get revenge on me. I’m using double grenade launchers and mini guns every game. I will AR spam you 24/7 in my 6 story metal 1x1. I don’t even build anymore, I wait till one of you sweats gets 4 stories above me, I’ll grapple up to you and double barrel you. That’s my play style. ",FortNiteBR

When it finally came out, I hopped into a game. Quickly I found out this was terrible. 32v32, first off what is that? Secondly, the games take way to long. As soon as you start dominating dance floors, the storm moves in, stopping everything. I don’t understand why. Thirdly, respawns. Respawns are the only thing making this game mode slightly work, because if they weren’t there, nobody would care about the dance floors until the other team has been eliminated, practically making it a 50v50, but of course, 32v32. But with respawns comes idiots that just mess around and not play the game. Finally, just the dynamic. When everyone is fighting for that last dance floor in the middle, there are two types of people. Those who go into the action and die instantly, making it no fun, and those you just sit back with a sniper the whole match, which is extremely boring. All in all this game just doesn’t work, which truly is a shame.

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted some feedback from you guys about what is happening with my epic games account. From the previous posts I have read most of them say Ive lost my account and a few say they are lucky with support and get it escalated to someone and can get it fixed. Sorry that its a long post.

&amp;#x200B;

So since saturday 10/6 there has been someone who added my email to a bot list and started spamming my personal email with several emails PER MINUTE subscribing me to the most random things, some in English and others in languages I dont understand . So in a day thats quite a bit. It was frustrating because I had my emails forwarded to my main one so I was receiving double the emails.  So I google/reddit which tells me that when that happens the person is trying to distract you from important emails by flooding you with emails and to check your accounts regularly.

Come monday 10.8 I check my bank account in the morning and most of is gone. I investigate what is happening and someone had entered my bank account and set themselves up for a transfer that the money was set aside for but was not to be sent until the next day. Because I caught it I was able to stop the transfer. I also put a certain amount into savings on an automatic transfer which the person setup another transfer to themselves the day I put the money in to take the same amount out. I was able to contact the bank and close those two compromised accounts. Started the process to change emails/passwords. I never thought that I would have to change my epic games password.

Monday I played my last fortntite game and Tuesday I logged in for a minute to checked my dailies and I only have two so I logged off. I logged in last night to play because I knew I would have 3 dailies to see that I my account has been locked. It gives you 3 reasons, because of fraud, has been asked to be locked and I cant remember the third one. I send an email to support saying I am not sure why my account has been closed. This morning I get an email that my account has been closed observed using cheating to gain an advantage against other players.

&amp;#x200B;

In my shock I replied to them asking what type of cheating and telling them all this info. In their email they said it was a  perma ban but its extremely frustrating that I am about to lose close to the past 3 seasons of battle pass for something that I did not do.  On another post someone said that they were banned and it was escalated to someone higher and that person said they should have never been banned. I am hoping for that type of situation.  I play online to play with my brothers in law and to relieve some stress. I have been patiently waiting for save the world and would never cheat. I even spent so much time getting level 80 for omegas final tier. I dont think ill play anymore after losing all that. I never even spent much money on the game just on one battle pass which I saved the points for the next one and buying the eagle emote.

&amp;#x200B;

Im waiting for a response on their end now. How might you think this will play out?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for reading this and your input.",FortNiteBR

Consoles no matter what you do and whats your choice of mouse and keyboard, will always have over 0.3ms of input delay over PCs; that means PC players have a quicker response time, meaning they can build faster.
The PS4 has no mouse support, we can never turn mouse acceleration and no matter how much you tick with your sens it will never feel the same as a PC. They have better aim.
Not to mention 3000 dollar gaming machines run the game soo much smoother which needless to say it is also an advantage. You can spot enemies farther away and in close range combat quick turns its way easier to follow your target with your eyes.
They were already pairing mouse players against each other before the end of season 5. Just put us on the same lobby again for christ sake.
I get that most kids (the game's main audience) plays on controller and couldnt stand a chance agaisnt a good mkb player; but the same applies in this situation. The learning curve is also bigger on PC than in a console with mkb. I to this day adjust my sens because mouse acceleration is absurd.

The fact that they fawn themselves so much over the skins makes it seem they don't appreciate the whole, and their stuck-up behavior is very indicative of other games that have imploded due to elitist people that played the game earlier than others. Is this seriously not enough for them? Do they not appreciate the hard work and effort? Skull Trooper was fully intended to be re-released this year, and the reaction people had to it makes me really want Epic to go ""Okay, fine. You want to be so selfish? We'll disable everything in your inventory for a period of time until you can stop being so narcissistic and start appreciating what we do for all of you."" or just giving it out and/or re-running previous battle passes because of the borderline sociopathic behavior of those grinding others into the dirt. It's happened to far more games than I can count, and this is not a very wise decision on Epic's part. Even the TF2 crowd was like this and they just got hats and medals.  


They're being self-centered and egotistical about basically virtual polygons which amounts to nothing.   
What they SHOULD be appreciative of, is the gameplay, the artstyle, the design, the soul. All parts of the game.  


It's extremely immature behavior and only encourages elitism. The fact that ""ogs"" screamed about a skin that Epic fully intended to re-release is that much more disgusting, and gives us old-time gamers a bad rep.

* Throwing impulse grenades to blast me away from a chest/supply drop.

* Building a 1/1 around me when I'm down, then just waiting for me to die and taking my gear.

I have taken no long breaks from playing and I feel like my aim, build skills, speed, and overall abilities are still as good as they used to be. But now I find myself losing gunfight after gunfight after gunfight. What is the cause of this increase in overall skill level? I know a new season means player spikes but I don't remember people being any better or worse for that reason.

&amp;#x200B;

Has the skill level just increased for whatever reason since season 5? I'm probably just bitching about being bad but I feel like there has to be some explanation as to why I went from 15 kill games to barely being able to survive my drop.

My friend activated the 2FA app authentication process and he had an inconvenient, he deleted the app thinking he wouldn't need it anymore and then his computer's hard drive was wiped after it stopped working, now he can't get back into his account because he doesn't have the app's codes nor the backup codes.

He contacted Epic, and an employee told him to give a ton of information: (✓ is he knew/answered, ✗ is he didn't)
-Email Associated with his account ✓
-Username ✓
-IP ✓
-Date the account was created ✗
-One proof of purchase from any transaction associated to the account ✗
-Place the purchases were made ✓
-Last 4 digits of the credit card used on the account ✓
-Days since you last connected ✗
-Names of accounts that you linked to this Epic account ✗ (He hadn't linked anything)

This is 5/9 questions answered and I don't think a few of these questions make sense, how the hell would he remember when he created the account and how the fuck is he supposed to answer the names of the accounts linked to it since he didn't have any, the employee chose to say ""We take account security very seriously and can't give you the account back unless you answer all of the questions"" and I say, WHAT THE HELL EPIC!? How is he supposed to remember most of this!? I don't think there's anything telling you, as soon as you first make your account to write down the creation date, or to remember how many days since he last connected, he gave a lot of information that could verify him as the real owner of the account but even then you're asking for him to answer even the least plausible of questions.

Reaction time is a huge factor in this game, as is predictive pattern analysis. You get a feel for when you should duck, when to build, when to shoot, you get a feel for how to pace your shots, where to aim with a sniper, etc.

So why are a chunk of players naturally pretty good and why are a chunk naturally pretty bad? It comes down to several factors, most of which are mental in some way. Confidence plays a huge factor in this game. All of my best games have been when I was confident and when my mouse literally felt like an extension of my arm. I wasn't focused on the feel of it and my performance reflected this. If you're constantly aware of your grasp on your mouse, your mood, amongst many other things, that's your ball and chain and you're bound to do worse than someone who is playing all the time mastering their confidence and being totally immersed in the game.

The other side of this is something called the MBTI. This is a personality indicator that determines the type of person you are, your focus, your weaknesses, etc. There are thinkers, feelers, sensors and intuitives. To be as brief as possible, have you ever met someone who thinks in black and white and can appear cold? Thinker. Do you know anyone who wears their heart on their sleeve and are too sensitive? Feeler. Do you know someone who is very adept at noticing patterns and typically is brilliant, even if very distracted and clumsy? Intuitive. What about that guy who is good at every sport he tries? Sensor. There are many types and your type affects so much.

Now, this can certainly vary and it's not a complete science, but it is a good guide to determining the type of person you are and the type of people in your life. Each type goes far deeper than that, in fact there are 16 actual types, but those are the basics. Some people are quite literally not as aware of their body as other people. They have to work 10x as hard to dance properly, irl of course, and typically are slow learning hands on activities. Other people are intensely aware of their five senses and are able to get more comfortable when playing. Sensors make up about 25-35% of society and typically these people are more aware of their five senses. I would wager almost every pro player is a sensing type, or an intuitive that is capable of catching on to specific patterns.

Anyways, the point of all of this is to show that not everyone starts with the same set of skills. Some people do have to put in a lot more leg work to hone their reaction time. If you suck at Fortnite, chances are you're good at something more than others, so don't beat yourself up too hard about a game. My best advice is to keep trying and to really pay attention to patterns and to practice playing confidently. Anyone can get good at this game, but not everyone is adept at it from start and that's perfectly fine even if it is difficult to accept.

**TLDR**: Confidence plays a huge factor in excelling in this game as does your ability to analyze patterns and learn from them. Not everyone starts with the same mental skill set. Some people aren't as aware of their bodies or five senses for that matter. If you've got background noise in your head, you're going to fuck up. There are many personality types, as is verified by psychology and each type has a different arrangement of cognitive functions which take into the account the mental and the physical. As hard as it is to accept, some people have to work twice as hard to be good at this game. Let go of your awareness when playing and try as hard as possible to truly immerse yourself into the game.",FortNiteBR

My problem with this game is, that it is loosing it's fun aspect. It's not about playing and having fun anymore, it's more like playing like you're in a 1-million dollar tourney. People are playing like their life depends on it, everbody is sweating for kills respectively wins.

I mean I really don't mind some good build fights with some editing and all that stuff, but what is going on right now is just ridicioulus. No one wants to get in a fight, everybody is just looking for that third party opportunity, no one is taking shots before building four stories up, and all of a sudden one-by-one's are a thing again in late game, to only name a few of the 'problems'.

So many people are saying epic is destroying the game with all these updates and new weapons and map changes, but I really don't see why some new stuff would kill the game. But what in my opinion really kills fortnite, are the players which play as I described. 

I know so many people who play this game regularly since almost a year, almost everyone of them is feeling the same way I do. It's just not possible anymore to just get some games in, have some fun and get a couple of wins. There's just no room anymore for guys who just like to have a good time, because every game is feeling more and more like a scrim nowadays.

Some guys be like 'you just have to adapt to it'.
But what if I do? All of a sudden I would be a part of the problem, by playing like all the other try hards like my whole life depends on it.

I could go on and even write more about it, but I would like to know what the public opinion is. Let me know how you guys feel about it.

Playing Fortnite back in Season 2 &amp; 3 I found it a lot more enjoyable. The reason for this is because it still felt like a fun casual experience

I wouldn't say I'm bad or anything like that but I feel like every time I get into a game I'm playing nothing but people who play like it's the Fall Skirmish and there's $1,000,000 on the line.

I used to play Fortnite to have a good time with my friends or just relax by myself. Now I feel like it's a constant thing where I'm getting into fights with 14 year old kids who drink a tub of GFuel everyday.

I understand that there are modes for casual players like 50v50, but I want to play a gamemode where I'm not looting for 75% of the time waiting around for 15% and then getting 5 kills and waiting for the game to end. If I wanted to play a competitive shooter, I'd play CS:GO, which I do a lot, but when I want to relax I'd always choose this game because it was fun and casual. Now it's just a total sweat-fest of a game and the enjoyment has gone down a ton.

Never, in all of history, has such an artistic masterpiece ever been created. The choreography is possibly the most beautiful sight ever beheld by the human eye.

I find my self watching my in-game avatar performing this phenomenal dance ritual for hours on end. The beat of the song is without a doubt the most amazing musical composition in history, one to rival, if not surpass the complexity and beauty of Mozart’s classics. The default dance has truly revolutionized the future of music, and how artists should aspire to create. Some would describe the default dance as a meme, or just part of the game it is appearing in, however I would strongly disagree. These people simply do not understand that the default dance is the center of existence. The universe, science, and evolution are purely myths, as the default dance was the first life form to roam the Earth.

So lets get started

*a = -9.81 m/s^2* (Acceleration due to gravity)

*v = 0* (When the rocket reaches it's max vertical displacement at a moment the velocity is zero)

*t = 7.5s* (The time the rocket takes to go up then back down is 15s but I'm going to divide this by 2 so we get the displacement of the rocket when it is at it's max height)

The formulas we're going to be using are:

*v^2 = v(o)^2 + at*

*s = [(**v* *+* *v(o)**)/2]t*

(*s* = displacement and *v(0)* = initial velocity because idk how to do subscripts on reddit)

Now we're going to substitute the acceleration(*a*), final velocity(*v*) and time(*t*) into *v^2* *=* *v(o)*^2 *+* *at* and solve for *v(o)* (I'm going to be doing multiple steps at once)

*0^2 = v(o)^2 + 9.81(7.5)*

*v(o)^2 = 73.575*

*v(o) =  8.5776 m/s* -This the the velocity which the Quad Rocket launches the rocket

Now we're going to sub the initial velocity(*v(o)*), final velocity(*v*) and time(*t*) to *s = [(v + v(o) )/2]t* and solve for s

*s = [(0 + 8.5776)/2]7.5*

*s = 32.166m* -This is the displacement of the rocket at it's peak right before it starts to descend

Thanks for reading through this if you even managed to get to this point

Although, I feel the purple skully does not fully bring out the Og side of the community. I started fortnite in the paid access days when there was no duos or squads but I was a f2p player. Season 2 is when I really spent money and got into the game (blackknightgang). I believe that the purple skully style should be given to users who have played fortnite season 1 as us f2p og's have recieved no thanks for playing items or anything.

My point is, I think you can buy a skin and be salty because it came back ( with manners ofc)
We can take many examples, there are cards which are extremely rare and people don’t actually buy those cards to play with, they want to make profit or feel the exclusivity.

Isn’t that a feeling, that we can have? If I bought the skull trooper back then, it’s actually the same thing.
I’m open to all discussion, I’m here to understand, I think you can buy a skin whether you like it or not, rarity can have an impact in your purchase.",FortNiteBR

Also it seems like many players are starting to abuse the aim assist feature by constantly aiming down sight and crouching , and out repeatedly to be more accurate. 

So not only does mine not work, but other players are barely missing by only relying on aim assist.

This is very frustrating and I'm at a major disadvantage now.

Can we PLEASE get a response on these issues soon?

I have only been playing since the beginning of Season 3, but I have noticed, or feel to have noticed an increased prevalence of individuals thirsting myself/teammates/others sine I have began playing.  I feel as if when I started playing, it was almost an unspoken rule to not thirst players and instead clean up the whole team, but in recent months I see players holding down the trigger on an opponent before they even hit the ground during the period when they are invulnerable, even while these players are under fire from other teams.

&amp;#x200B;

As I have played the game more these past two seasons, I have noticed that I too have hopped on this trend, especially early game or if I know that I need Mats/Heals that my downed opponent might have.  I am especially vengeful if members of my team have been thirsted or game ended and proceed to thirst every player I down moving forward.

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware that this might be a controversial topic, but I don't simply want to blame this on children/noobs literally being thirsty for kills even though there are times when this could be the case.  I feel as if this ""unspoken rule"" has been broken and repeatedly snowballed into what we have now. I don't feel as if this is game breaking or puts the game in a bad place.  I simply want to know your thoughts on this topic.  Thank you!",FortNiteBR

## That your little battle pass Isn't ""OG""

## Message to people who say Black Knight is ""OG""

&amp;#x200B;

Surprise! No, It's not. If you want to be an OG, use original items like the Battle bus Icon, Renegade Raider, Mako Glider etc.

In season 2, Fortnite was extremely popular, just not mainstream yet. The game had over 30 million players. I know people get upset when people mention that they're not oG, I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

Your constant use of ""OG"" is cringey and insulting to people who've played since the beginning, not season 2.

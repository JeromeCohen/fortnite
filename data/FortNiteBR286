This is the ideal solution, as you cannot just build your way out of every situation but must actually use gunplay to defeat people and strategically choose when you feel you are in an emergency situation and need to burn most of your materials to have a ""get out of jail free"" card. This also solves the ""shotgun meta"" complaints people are complaining about. Turbo building is causing the shotgun meta. Turbo building makes it so that there is no point in even challenging an expert player at range. They can defend themselves indefinitely with non-stop wall building faster than you can shoot through it. This renders almost every weapon in the game moot other than shotguns and high tier rifles.

But based on the extremely negative responses to any discussion (including this downvoted topic) about this feature, it is clear the community would rather continue to have a game where combat is reliant on racing to see who can build over their opponent first so you can shotgun then from above. I am just curious to why the community prefers the game this way. I get that expert players would prefer things to stay the same so they can continue dominating everyone else by abusing how strong building is but I don't get why the casual players defend it as well. Even if you are the ""What is Fortnite without building, idiot!"" type, surely you agree that building should be a movement and temporary cover system, not a way to indefinitely avoid damage and force shotgun standoffs.",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôve been *‚Äùplaying‚Äù* since launch, but I was not apart of season 2 one bit. Jumping back in during season three, seeing these guys were insane. I couldn‚Äôt believe I was just killed by a tier 100 from last season, how cool. But now, you rarely see these guys, but when you do, oh boy. 

But, in the other two‚Äôs sides, Reaper (John Wick) was what I came to know as pretty  scary because  i just remember hearing squad mates saying ‚ÄúOh god it‚Äôs a bunch of John Wicks‚Äù before we were all dead. 

With Omega, there‚Äôs way too many of them at the moment. Even saying this, when you see an Omega *with* lights, then you know that they‚Äôre the real ones to look out for. They actually leveled and are probably pretty good, and they usually are. I‚Äôm chilling down here at my level 55 Omega because I cannot reach anywhere near that high of a level this season. 

All three for me though are pretty close to a tie. Black Knight just takes it though because of back in the godly days. ",FortNiteBR

I'm not going to reveal this persons name, or anything that would reveal him. But after our first game that we absolutely demolished, we decided to play a few more and I even joined on discord as my in-game voice chat was messing up. At first all was normal, until I literally went to leave his discord - I saw previous chat logs. I really really could care less if anything I say is believed, because it literally doesn't matter lol. This person is no longer in contact with me, nor do I care for their security in this matter. Basically, all the details I rounded up was along the lines of this:

\- Battle Bus in season 5 is removed, replaced with something to do with the crack in the sky, and ""blasting"" towards the map instead.

\- A few of the ""lame"" points of interests are getting upgraded. Apparently the team are struggling on what to do with Tilted Towers, they have discussed destroying it many times but its such a love/hate POI that its been hard, but the new upgrades should help this out.

\- Loot crates were supposed to come out at launch of S5, and are still coming but delayed. There will be a loot crate for every rarity of weapon (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary) - but there wont be a multitude of crates, its just something to help actually GIVE skins and emotes to players, so adding more doesn't feel so cheesy long-term.

\-  The Drum Gun was very well received, as were the Dual Pistols, but its unsure if they'll stay because when it comes down to the basics every weapon should be unique and actually have its own purpose. Sometimes guns like these are added to add variety and flavour for the players.

\- A whole new map is actually being concepted at the moment, but its still a long time away. As soon as map#1 is perfected, further work will be done. The team are also considering adding seasons to the current map before a second map is done. (Winter, Autumn, Spring, Summer). 

\- He was talking to someone about how Epic want to redo the leaderboard system, or find a way to add some sort of ranked mode. They want people who invest more time into the game to be able to achieve something bigger than what someone who plays maybe ""3 or 4 games a night"" does. 

\- Unique player skins for high skill has been talked about, and high-skill challenges that unlock skins has been talked about. Unsure whether these challenges would be linked to a battle pass or not, as some F2P players with high skill shouldn't be ignored.

\- Dinosaurs. Loot infested Dinosaurs.",FortNiteBR

I suggest adding a longer invincibility timer (15 seconds, indicated by the skin flashing?) or simply decreasing the amount of time it takes to bleed out while removing enemy damage. That way, nearby teammates have a chance to save you, and the enemy is forced to engage the squad instead of down, kill, loot and run.

This is probably an important detail. 

Anyway, before, my father was paying for any of my skin purchases with his credit card. Now however, as I do not own my own card and since I don't live with my father currently, I made a deal with my roommate to buy skins for me in return for cash. When he entered his debit card, he got a message to contact epic support. After two weeks of no response, they finally replied with :


Hello,
Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support.‚ÄÇWe apologize for the delay in our response.
Due to your account attempting to add a card that has been reported as lost or stolen, purchasing has been permanently blocked on your account. This is done in order to protect card holders from having their lost or stolen cards used without their authorization.
Epic Games support is unable to remove this block upon request. We appreciate your understanding in this matter.
If you have any additional issues or questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us.

The card was NEVER reported stolen before, and IS owned by my roommate. I don't understand how epic came up with the response that it was a stolen card, because my roommate literally uses it to buy skins on his own account. I tried telling epic support that I can provide any proof of ID, literally anything they ask for to prove that it is not a stolen card, and is owned by my roommate, but instead they just give me copy and pasted replies saying that they can't do anything and aren't even willing to look into this issue for me.
My account is an account with many skins, including rare season 1 skins which I love and do not want to lose. I however cannot see myself playing it when I literally can't buy anything else that will be added into the store, including future battle passes. I would really love for an epic employee to see this, and maybe even look into this for me. I can provide any proof that is needed to prove that the card was never stolen.",FortNiteBR

So with that in mind I will reword my post to best EDUCATE how playstation players can influence Sony to pay attention to our request to join Microsoft and Nintendo in the cross-play movement. 

As we head into Season 5 there is one way we can stand together as a community. Sony gets a cut of the money/v-buck transactions that occur on their platform. With that said, it would affect Sony the most if playstation players find alternative ways of purchasing in-game items. 

For example, purchasing the new battle pass on mobile or PC/Mac keeps Sony from getting their cut. In addition it would affect Sony if players started making all purchases through another platform. The bottom dollar line is what matters the most to large corporations. 

As stated this is not a ""CALL TO ACTION"" this is a informative post to educate players about one way they can make a stance for what they believe in. 

Curious to hear the community feedback.

I just picked up the game at the beginning of this season, and I got the Battle Pass. I never thought I'd make it all the way to the Omega skin, but the challenges and goodies strewn throughout the season were fun anyways, so I went for it.

Now here I am, close to finishing all the challenges, and I have about 20 tiers left on the pass. To my surprise, if I grinded out the remaining challenges and bought the 10 pack of tiers thats in the shop, I can max out my pass and actually get the Omega skin! I'm temped because it's so close!

Thing is, I'm only level 45. I know I can't hit level 80 and get the cool glow effects, but if I can hit level 55 and get the Omega helmet, I'm happy. Otherwise I may just skip it and take a break from the game until next season. 

I did the math and it looks like it'll be about 70,000 experience points to hit 55. I Have the 100% EXP bonus, but I'm not very good at this game, with one win under my belt. And none of my friends play it. I can get like 2 or 3 kills in a game, but beyond that I'm pretty lousy. I'm not a proud man, and I don't mind annihilating my stats to maximize EXP gain. can I make it to level 55 in the week I have left? ",FortNiteBR

**Some tips for leveling up**

‚Ä¢Play 50v50 with a full squad. Up to 1000 XP if you win and get a kill or two.

‚Ä¢Get top 10 in solos. This will leave you with 600-700 XP a game.

‚Ä¢This is technically against epic‚Äôs rules, but bushcamp at your own risk. 50v50s that you win will automatically grant you about 500 XP (That is if you don‚Äôt die, of course.) You can also do solos and get top 10 for 600-700 XP.

‚Ä¢Don‚Äôt play playground. I know it‚Äôs fun and tempting, but epic is planning on making it a permanent gamemode. 

‚Ä¢Do daily challenges! Free 1000 XP every day will lower your needed XP by another 5000.

-Obviously a black outfit but I think a dress with a opening on it would look very fitting for a badass sexy assassin version of John Wick. Maybe with some features to show more of a feminine look to her, like her back to have open like Ava in Resident Evil 6 (I think was the game.)

-A tattoo on the leg that is most visible on the dress or her arm. As the same type of tattoo John Wick has on his back but maybe with a twist in detail. I would think it could wrap around her arm or leg.

-I personally prefer her hair to be down and parted to the side, but maybe that can be a customizable thing like to change the hairstyle.

-Her shoes could be heels but I feel that may not work too well or could be too feminine or troupey as far her being a female assassin in my opinion. So I would put her with some boots that go up her legs with maybe a subtle design like ‚ÄúJW‚Äù to show she‚Äôs in relation to John Wick. 

-Torn between Red lipstick and like blackish purple more so leaning to the black. 


And that‚Äôs pretty much it of what I think she could look like. The name of her is in the title if nobody caught that but that‚Äôs just off the top of my head. 

Had a thought of making her instead of purely gender swap and putting a spin on her like instead of her being white make her black and invert all the things I said and make that white. 

Thoughts are welcome have fun with it.",FortNiteBR

But why is it so sought out for?](https://i.redd.it/lka51mm4g8811.png)

The definition of the term rare, as many already know, is ‚Äúnot found in large numbers and consequently of interest or value.‚Äù  An example of something rare would be [this.](https://poshmark.com/listing/POKMON-PIKACHU-CARD-RARE-PURPLE-BKGRND-1995-57bb9ec27fab3a6d6b00051f?utm_source=gdm&amp;l_con=PREOWNED%2FUSED&amp;gdm_bottom=false&amp;campaign_id=1039493669&amp;utm_campaign=1039493669&amp;enable_guest_buy_flow=true&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0raDzK2J3AIVkY-zCh1y1gGpEAQYASABEgLKl_D_BwE) 

An old Pokemon card, valued at 1,500 USD...sounds crazy, right? This Pokemon card is one of the first of its kind, and hardly anyone in the world has the same exact card - meaning its limited in quantity. Not many people having this card, plus the fact that it is old, plus the even greater fact that Pokemon has a large following all add up to why its rare. People want this specific, special card because essentially nobody has it and because its old. People can say, if they owned it, ‚ÄúNobody has this card!‚Äù, or, ‚ÄùThis thing is over 10 years old!‚Äù which make the card itself cool.

This is the same with Fortnite cosmetic. For example, the Skull Trooper is an old Halloween skin from 2017 that many people want. People actually pay real money for the skin - up to 700 dollars! But why do people want it so badly? Because its old, nobody has it - its rare. Most people assume when they see someone using the Skull Trooper skin is that they‚Äôre good at the game because they‚Äôve almost have been playing the game for over a year - meaning they have experience with the game.  You also rarely see Skull Troopers, which usually makes people say ‚ÄúHey, thats a pretty rare skin‚Äù because obviously.. its rare.

A skin being rare just makes peoples egos rise. Thats why people care about rarity. Many casual players respect the ‚ÄúOGs‚Äù of Fortnite, adding to the ego of someone with the skin. Many people don‚Äôt have the skin, adding to the ego even more. Many people want the skin, making the ego skyrocket up. You have to remember that Fortnite has 125 million players worldwide. Having a rare skin to show off makes you cool, essentially because only a couple of people have this or that skin.

Lets say you walk into a public street and everyone has the same shirt on, excluding you. How would you feel? Special, right? You‚Äôre one in thousands of people on that street to be wearing a shirt that nobody else has on.

**TL;DR:** People like having rare skins because nobody has them, they‚Äôre usually old, and it adds to their ego. It makes them cool (denying that someone with the Renegade Raider skin isn‚Äôt respected is a lie, cmon).

The infinite dab is just the dab emote on a left to right loop, or is it right to left? Besides that, most or all emotes nowadays in Fortnite are on a loop which you think would make it warrant a update or at least refund. What‚Äôs next? The infinite snap emote? How far will they take this, it may be an overreaction sure, but charging users 300 more v-bucks (500) compared to dab (200) just for a loop is ridiculous.

So a while a back my cousin tried to prank me by trading my account  (yes he knew all my info)(another thing i didn't knew about this, i knew this once the damage was done) so the prank went wrong and he got scammed and lost the account. So days later i contacted epic support to tell what had happened and i said that if they could ban the account because this and this happen and if they could transfer all my progress to a new account. They responded that they have ban the account because its violated the terms and they couldn't transfer progress between accounts because they have no such feature. I responded ok i understand but i didn't knew its was gonna be traded  if i knew i would have stop the situation. They said there nothing they can do about that but its still ban. So im like ok can you guys at least refund me the money that i have spent?. It took them almost two weeks to respond or probably more that and they responded that  refunds for ban account are unavailable. I responded ok its kinda good because i dont have a bank account im only 17 so i responded ok but can at least be refunded thru v bucks? And i swear to god it took them two weeks to understand that i wanted v bucks and not the cash and finally they got it and said that they cant refund thru v bucks. At this point its been a month in and still nothing im losing my mind and stuff im clearly mad at this point so im like ok can you guys at least refund thru skins of my choice since i spent 100+dlls and the previous account i should get 100dlls worth of skins of my choice so i write them the skins that i want and the coast of each of them and all of that stuff and explaining them the situation and you know what they responded to  me they said that they couldn't award ingame items for free and if i wanted to refund skins that they had a feature ingame which allow me to. At this point a completely lose it and i started writing this shit.
I have currently all the tickets i can take screenshots of them if u guys want i even had to switch emails because they wouldn't respond to the other at one point they just ignore me. I dont know if my account is still ban because they wouldn't respond me i ask if i can use an unban appeal they wouldn't respond me so i don't know about if the account is still ban or not so currently its been almost two months and nothing and i hoping posting it here will do something and one observation i have made that they dont read all the ticket complete they read bits of it and make a respond to that bit that they read because clearly and most of the time they respond the wrong information or a hole different subject so im hoping by posting here it will do something.

Yes, I know Epic is working on next season, events, playground mode v2 and so on but I think it's necessary for the sake of gameplay to fix these things. Such as the double trap exploit where you place a trap through a floor, I've already died many times with 10+ kills early game because a random guy just runs to my 1x1 cube while Im healing, breaks my floor and places his own and then double traps me and before I know it, Im dead (150 damage :c ouch). It's just really dumb how a glitch like this is still out there and frustrating how something so stupid can ruin your experience. Another thing, which is complicated is the wallhopping/phasing through walls ""glitch."" It's also really frustrating when people do the wall hop glitch and just kills you while you're off guard and trying to move away or something or when you're building and have your blueprint and paper out while a dude just jumps right through and pumps you and you're dead...this happens the most early game where everyone's kinda close together and usually you dont have all that much health after numerous fights or a lack of shields, etc. I don't really know about coding and making a game perfect but I feel like there's a better end to this that doesn't push people off when edited on or built on but also doesn't let people (at least appear to) phase through walls. To be honest, this game would be perfect with a few polishes so I really hope these things can be resolved. ;D If you guys have ideas on how to approach this, you should comment it.",FortNiteBR

In order to make sure people aren‚Äôt abusing this system Epic Games could set a limit of how many vbucks you can earn a day. I feel like 50 vbucks a day would be a fair amount you could get a day. On average if you get the maximum each day that would be about 1500 vbucks a month. People who still spend money on skins will really not get an advantage since the daily cap is only 50.

Nothing feels worse than playing well and building well only to lose and be rewarded less for a game than someone who opened a chest and hid for the entire match, especially when it's more or less luck based that with 9-10 kills I don't have any jump pads or campfires left and can't heal up or bail after the 2nd-to-last fight in the game. I can live with not getting the victory royale- I'm sure I'll get another to replace this loss soon. My issue is that playing well and aggressive and reaping the rewards of the playstyle with many kills and a lot of damage done isn't reflected in my rewards for each game.

Can you guys please tweak the rewards for solo performance in solo games, please!",FortNiteBR

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Often, when people make posts like this, they go unnoticed, or are recognized as a meme/joke. I, on the other hand, would like to ask the community how many of you seriously, unironically want the crossbow back.

I believe the crossbow was given an unfair treatment. From my experience, the main gripe people had with it was how common it spawned in chests, especially in the first chest they got, thus ""dooming"" them. However, these same complaints are what led to the buff of the silenced smg.

Being one of the only three silent weapons at the time, it was painful to watch it go. Stealth players everywhere were disappointed. Now we only have two silent weapons, and neither of them function long range. The crossbow was the perfect silent sniper. Its slow projectile and huge drop countered the silence buff, and its high damage was the reward for using it correctly.

I have seen far more complaints about the semi as a sniper, and the smg as a weapon in general than I ever saw about the crossbow, and neither of those were removed.

If anything, the most I can hope for is a repsonse from epic as to why it was removed. Guided missile was removed for ruining endgame, yet crossbow was removed because some people didn't find it useful.

What are the community's thoughts on this?",FortNiteBR

I used to be amazed by buildings in the regular game mode, but after the playground ltm, I just don't have that ""hype"" anymore. 

Playground opens a lot of oppurtunities and it just makes cool things but less cool.

In my opinion, it can stay, but it shouldn't be permanent; then it will just turn into minecraft with guns.",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôm currently writing the story for my blockbuster challenge, but I‚Äôm finding myself with a deficiency in skins that could be interpreted as ‚Äúvillains‚Äù in season 4.

Obviously, Omega is the main villain.  However, I‚Äôm not sure who else I can use alongside him in my story.  I was considering using 3 or 4 other ‚Äúnoir‚Äù skins to act as entourage-type-characters, but I thought I‚Äôd just ask on here for some suggestions.

P.S. also open to hero ideas too :)",FortNiteBR

I'm level account level 55 atm, and battle pass level ~72.  I know I can probably hit battlepass 100, even if I have to purchase some tiers, my question is more about the breakpoints at which the armor for Omega unlocks.

At what account level do you get all of the armor pieces?  Every screen shot I can find online says - ""Reach level 65"" but then the progress bar underneath shows X/55...implying that you only need to reach level 55.

Was hoping to get some clarification on what level I will unlock all the pieces.  I believe level 80 you get a different chest piece and the ability to swap the colors...I know I won't be getting that, I'm more concerned with what level I unlock the last piece.",FortNiteBR

What is my suggestion?

I have two: Make a new knight, someone that the new people would like and keep the Red Knight for the oldies.

Or

Return the Red Knight to the shop but only people who previously could have bought it, and didn‚Äôt can buy it.

For people with Skull Trooper and Ghoul Trooper,

Reskin it, make a girl skull trooper and a jOnSeY ghoul trooper. 

This way everyone with the old skins can be semi-happy they had them still and the ones who beg for them can get a different version of them.

I also saw a cool Tomatohead reskin idea Concept where it‚Äôs a jackolantern instead. I thought that was cool.

Final thing All Season 1 Seasonal Shop Items Should never return. That‚Äôs real sentimental for those with them

TLDR: All seasonal items shouldn‚Äôt return in the same form, such as a gender swap or color swap can fix it up.

&amp;nbsp;  
We appreciate all of the awesome feedback we‚Äôve received and are beginning work on the next version of Playground. We‚Äôll be turning off the Playground LTM on Thursday, July 12th as we take it back under construction for the next version.    
&amp;nbsp;  
For the next version of Playground we‚Äôre hoping to include functionality that would allow team selection options within the Playground itself. Here‚Äôs a few things you would gain with the ability to select teams:  
&amp;nbsp;  

 * 1v1s and 2v2s
 * Aim assist for controllers
 * Editing other player‚Äôs structures
 * Traps affecting teammates/enemies correctly
 * Highlighting teammates on the map
 * Damaging enemies with your pickaxe

&amp;nbsp;  
The Playground LTM represents our first step into what a full creative mode looks like in Fortnite. And remember, you will have until the release of v5.0 to access your Playground LTM replays.   

&amp;nbsp;    
Thank you and let us know what else you‚Äôd love to see in a future version!

First of all, I hate this game now. Used to love it, now I honestly cant play more than 5 games before just taking a big sigh and signing off. 

The meta now is complete and utter garbage in my personal opinion. The problem with having everything be a viable weapon is that the RNG goes even more through the roof than it already was. Nowadays, Epic just continues to pour on the building nerfs and the sprayable weapon buffs. 

Want to build? Sorry, I have a 
-SMG 
-LMG
-Minigun
-TommyGun
-C4
-RPG
-Clinger
-Grenade
-Grenade Launcher

Got highground? Sorry I have a 
- Impulse Grenade
- Bounce Pad
-Launch Pad
- Hop Rocks

All in all, its a massive clusterfuck of RNG now. There are so many possible ways to die, so many viable weapons that you could never predict what youre in for. Its like every fight I get into the player has the exact item he needs to counter me. Basically, I just needed to rant about why this game has lost my love and why I only play about 3 hours a week in comparison to about 30 hours a week prior. ",FortNiteBR

Why add stink bombs, OP C4, 3 different nades, smgs that shred builds and health while shotguns before were perfect. The LMG is a smg. Its like shotty accuracy used to be important and could make a less skilled team drop while they sprayed, but now the shotty works sometimes and you have to waste a slot for an smg. Shoot just let us create a class. And the guided missile is returning and that pretty much settles it. You set the game up to be competitive and when you were playing well it showed and twitch events were intense. Now I can go off and get dropped by 2 kids throwing nades and spraying the p90, LMG, tommy, and naming more is a waste of time. Oh and there shouldnr be 3 snipes try 2 at most cause the semi auto is like a scoped AR that defected in the factory. I like the thermal and the famas but the 30 things that can kill you with half being OP and ridiculous make the good additions worthless. Done with the game until the devs wake up and see that the game is oversaturated with advantages for kids that are okay with the game being loot based. You used to need a shotty, AR, snipe, explosives sometimes, and heals. Now I struggle with what to have as loot because theres too much stuff and its a guess what you'll need to counter all the troll strategies that seem to make skill and experience worthless.

Have you ever shot at someone and in 0.5s they have a castle built? Or have you shot at a default skin and they spam walls, confusing both of you?

Honestly I think there should be a cooldown between building walls/stairs/etc, and the current 999 material cap should be lowered significantly.

I think people should learn more ground tactics instead of building confusing structures and hiding. It seems like the player with the fastest building and the fastest shotgun trigger finger wins nowadays.

I get the concept of building a wall for cover, but come on. People don't need to be abusing the building mechanic. There's plenty of cover already on the map.

I have played this game almost every day since early season three, and the thing that always set it aside from the other BR's was the adrenaline I got from a build battle. This happened earlier today, I landed into Salty, two others landed on the same house, grenades blew up half the house and we all just started building, I managed to pump one guy and smg'd the other and claim the house. 

It's moments like this that made me fall in love with the game, and I'm worried with the mat nerfs in recent patches that it might be a feeling that will be gone soon. I understand some people find it frustrating, but when you get through the learning curve it's so worth it. 

I know this was quite long and drawn out but I felt like it needed to be said (for the 1000th time..) but we need to let Epic know that building is something we want to keep in the game for good.

# TL;DR: Building is a core part of the game, and with the recent nerfs I hope it doesn't fade into obscurity.

I believe that the solutions I'm proposing on this post aren't too absurd, and I'm positive that the BR player base wouldn't be outraged at these proposals. Again, these are the community's popular solutions explained with my own words and slight alterations.

**Assault Rifle-**  Due to it's competition with the much faster shooting and quiet Silenced SMG, the Assault Rifle has lost a bit of it's niche. To be completely on par with the Silenced SMG, the AR should get a small fire rate buff. (Silenced SMG Fire Rate is 9.0 and AR's Fire Rate is 5.5). A 6.5 would be the best spot in my opinion, a 7.0 would be a maybe. Anything higher than that would probably have people complaining. *I'm not saying the AR is bad, just saying it could be improved slightly without being op.*

**Shotguns-** Because of the SMG meta, shotguns have become slightly less ideal. Before you comment, I'm not going to ask for a damage increase or double-pumping to come back, but rather a small weapon switch buff. When I mean weapon switch, I mean the delay that occurs when switching to a shotgun. The delay of pulling out a shotgun should be just as long as if you pulled out any SMG or AR. And to clarify again, I'm not asking for the switch time between 2 shotguns to be buffed, I'm asking for the switch time between 1 shotgun and any weapon except a shotgun to be buffed. This will make shotguns slightly better if you are in the heat in the moment and make it slightly easier for skillful players to pull off a quick headshot. 

**Deagles and Revolvers-** Although they are still decent, I've seen many people upset with the damage drop off of these guns. Because it's complex to say exactly what the damage should be at a certain amount of meters, I'd just ask for Epic to make them more effective at long ranges. Their damage output at close-medium ranges are enough for people to consider picking them up. If the developers decide to go extreme with the Deagle and make it more unique, it would be cool if they reduced the damage drop off, but introduced a very light bullet drop off too (basically more of a pocket sniper). 

I'd like to hear any other solutions the community have to balance guns. Does anything else need a buff? nerf? should we consider combining 2 underused weapons to make 1 viable weapon? And most importantly, I'd like to hear some criticism about my post if you have any!",FortNiteBR

Of course, I won't get into it, but it was a bad experience that I believe led to low self-esteem and increased anger while playing the game. I eventually got school again, realized it just wasn't that fun, and quit.

Then I finally managed to get into this game. If it hasn't already been obvious, I get really competitive when it comes to getting better at something. I set myself to high standards, most of the time for worse than better, and often end up being what others 
have called too hard on myself.

I'm not making this post to express my frustration, as big as a weight would be lifted off me if I did, because it doesn't solve anything at the end of the day. I'm coming here because I don't want to make the same mistake.

Basically, I have about 200 games on Fortnite. I have one win. I somehow managed to get it yesterday. As much as it made me feel accomplished, I realize that celebrating for any longer than last night was going to slow me down, because the fact of the matter is I didn't engage in any sort of build fight that would have taken any sort of work. Maybe I'm downplaying, but I wanted to focus on the issues I'm having.

Maybe it's not even a huge issue. I know everyone goes through this when they start: they simply struggle. It's what's happening to me. I don't really know what to do in situations. I find that the times when I have the greatest chances of surviving is when I'm in a house and run into somebody all disoriented. If I run into anybody in any other situation, my attempt at building turns into panic. I try to emulate what I have been practicing in playground and what I've seen other streamers do, but all to no avail. To give an example, I managed to get the high ground against somebody outside by building a double ramp with walls about 2 high. I looked around for them, didn't see them anymore, and then got shot in the back and died. They had quite literally climbed up my own stairway and I hadn't noticed until it was too late.

It's gotten to the point where the game's getting less and less fun. Why? Because I don't find that I'm able to take away anything from the numerous 2 min long games I have. I can't faithfully analyze my own gameplay. I've tried to talk about what I should have done and I've tried to act out a better alternative in the next Spawn Island. Therefore, the thing that I am most worried and frustrated about is that I don't really think I'm going anywhere on this path. When I tried climbing to Gold in League, I often found I had some really good waves, felt good about myself and thought I was improving, and then fell right back down, which led me to think I just got lucky or something. This is turning into an endless cycle without any sort of affirmation that I'm actually getting anywhere, and the ""mistake"" I've referred to at the beginning is simply falling into the trap of ""just keep playing more"" which I fear turns into an excuse to play passively and patiently as nothing gets accomplished.

I know this is dramatic, and I'm sorry if I came off as cruel and cold. It's simply a byproduct of my frustration, I suppose. The bottom line is I really do want to get better, and I'm acknowledging that it will take a long time, but I just don't want to fall in the same trap here.

As a final note, I have been practicing in playground (double ramp, floor-wall-ramp, turnarounds, other double ramp, etc) and have been watching streams, but I find that it's really hard for me to take what they do and emulate it in my own games. It almost feels like they're never in my position, where I'm walking down street and suddenly somebody shoots at me.

Have a blast playing it and hour, but there is one thing that really bugs me out. Why does male and female fat skins excluded from BR? All we got there are thicc women such as Ramirez or Ginger Chick. Guys are bulky (Jonesy) or skinny (Drift). 

Now there is a question- how does a fat girl playing Battle Royale feels knowing there are fat skins in a game but no one bother to port them into the game because no one cares/would buy them. I can imagine she feels bad. I am a guy, and tbh I prefer thicc chicks-I always appreciate moves Ramirez does during True Heart (trying to get my GF to learn it since it came out) but when I play StW I really enjoy fat skins. Riding a Pony with a Fat Chick Izza is just glorious. I would kill to see her doing Groove Jam or Star Power. 

I just say, give a justice to fat people and stop excluding them from Battle Royale!

It could do 25 damage but keep them locked in it for about 5-10 seconds. They will sit there unless they press E, A, whatever the interact button is on the device you’re playing on.This could lead to some very interesting plays! Maybe make them a little smaller then a campfire so you can see them or just smaller than a bush, so they can be put in there? This could give it more potential use.

It should either build up more accuracy as it fires or be able to use the bipod in a stationary position with significantly increased accuracy.

Shotguns are about as broken as they ever have been.

I use both a KB and a controller, and for quite awhile was adamant on switching fully to Keyboard. I am actually much better aim on controller or I would use KB&amp;M all the time. I am a Ps4 player and I've never owned a PC able to game but I made the switch because I'm pretty competitive and quite frankly the building on a controller sucks. You can't make fast edits like the pros, you have to use one of three configs and there are so many little things that just make it way worse. For instance, on builder pro the stick rotates the build piece. Every once in awhile, I will somehow hit this during a build fight and rotate my ramp. Because it is such a weird button, I litterally die every time unless my enemy just allows me to sit and slowly rotate it back. If Epic ever added controller mapping, I would unbind this completely. I have no reason to rotate a ramp 

My point is this: Competitive players want the advantage. KB&amp;M is already an advantage, and without controller mapping you can make edits, crouch-peek and build quicker than anyone else using a controller. People who would love to use a controller feel almost forced into it because they want to be able to play like the pros and make basic customizations, and a controller won't let them do that. You can complain about the KB&amp;M users all you want, but without controller mapping the KB&amp;M option is way more enticing. ",FortNiteBR

I've put countless of hours honing in my building and gun skills since the BR mode came out just for Epic to cater to people who haven't by adding/buffing submachine guns, explosives, and everything else that takes little to no real skill to use. You can downvote this all you want but this is the most casual fan base in all of gaming and most won't understand why this is such a bad thing and will instead see all the changes as Epic Games ""listening to them"" but it's actually killing any chance of Fortnite having an actual competitive scene and that is what really keeps games alive for so many years (cc: CSGO, Overwatch, Call of Duty, etc). Very rarely does a game that focuses on online PvP ever survive for long without a real competitive scene. I've supported Epic Games since Gears of War 1 but I can't support this particular game anymore.

First and most important, the pump pullout delay needs to be removed. If only one thing from this post happens, it needs to be the pump pullout delay being removed. Second, the tactical shotgun's damage needs to be buffed back to what it was before the nerf that made pumps do 170 damage. Third, the pump should be made to oneshot again, but the effective range should be lowered, in order to allow the heavy to have a niche. The main reason that the pump should be made to oneshot again is because it would be the perfect counter to an SMG. A skilled player can counter an SMG sprayer with the perfect shot to the head. The new version of the pump should also do exactly 200 damage, so every pellet has to hit in order for it to oneshot.

181,JalapenoBridger,1532985921,93874g,28,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/93874g/fortnite_will_never_be_an_esport/,14,Fortnite will never be an ESport,"Epic Games is obviously trying to get Fortnite to become an ESport. They’ve hosted tournaments, and been investing in things to make it appear as one. But unless they make some changes, it will never be one.

**Bloom-**

Bloom is not something that should be in Fortnite. If I’m good at aiming, my shots should hit. With bloom, this won’t always happen. Now, I know they have first shot accuracy, and people use that to justify the existence of bloom, but the mechanic of the game shouldn’t be “You can either hit your first shot and take a chance on the rest of them, or you can take slower shots and get FSA on all of them.” If the dot is on a player and I start shooting, all of my shots should hit. I shouldn’t have to take slower shots and wait until I get FSA back to have a 100% chance of all my bullets hitting. Once again, it goes back to the fact that if I can aim well, I should deal damage. With bloom in place, Fortnite won’t take off as an ESport. Very few people will want to competitively play a game where their skill is capped because of a random number generator.

**Spray patterns-**

Now, you might be thinking that without bloom, you could just fire off all your shots with little skill required as long as you are able to move your mouse. That’s where spray patterns come in. Also known as recoil, spray patterns make your gun move around, thus forcing you to have a higher amount of skill to move your gun against the spray, thus requiring more skill. Not only does this take the luck aspect out of the game, it adds more skill required to it, thus making it more intriguing to ESports players. Once again, competitive players will be much more likely to play a game that requires skill than they are to play one that requires luck.

**Building (part one)-**

As of now, building in the skill gap between good players and bad players. Since aiming is somewhat random, the difference between good and bad players is their ability to build. And for some reason, Epic is doing everything they can to lower that skill gap. They decrease the amount of resources you get from harvesting certain items all the time, and they just recently decreased the health of wood (obviously the most common building resource), making it much easier to destroy. Because of this, people are beginning to build with stone more often. But surprise surprise, stone is found in less frequent places than wood, and the things you harvest it from do not drop as much stone as trees drop wood. Metal isn’t a very viable thing to build with either, as it is harder to find, and since it builds so slowly, you can destroy it almost as soon as it’s placed. It’s clear that Epic is trying to stop good players from building. They’re making structures easier to bring down, thus encouraging people to rush. When you rush, you shoot more because you wouldn’t be using a sniper rifle or an AR to fire off pop shots. You typically would use an SMG or a shotgun, and wouldn’t you know, those are the weapons that have the

most randomness. Once again, competitive players aren’t going to compete in a game in which they rush, spray, and pray. That involves too much luck, and again, no competitive player wants to play a game capped by RNG. By increasing building health for wood and increasing the amount you get, players would be more likely to have build battles and fort battles rather than spray and pray rushes.

**Building (part 2)-**

I know I just talked about building, but there were sort of two subjects about building that I wanted to talk about, and there wasn’t really a way to connect the ideas together smoothly, so I decided to make two sections. I touched briefly in the last section about the amount of resources you get, but I wanted to go more in depth about it here. I believe that they should increase the amount if materials you get by 100% while decreasing the max amount of materials you can hold by 50% (to 500). This would make building more viable in the beginning (as you wouldn’t have to harvest resources for five minutes to obtain a enough while you do now), but make players be more conservative with their resources. It would force players to pay closer attention to their materials in a build battle, so they would have to be much more strategic. If they ran out of materials in the middle of a fight, that would be really bad, so they would have to be more careful with building instead of just spamming wherever like most players do now. It would also mean that after a fight is over, they would have to go hunt down fifty trees and rocks to get materials again, just break a few trees and such and you’re probably good to go. It would create more skill required and speed up the game.

**Weapons-**

This is by far the most controversial thing I will talk about in this. I believe that weapon rarities and variants of weapons should be thrown out, as well as grenade launchers and RPGs. It’s all about eliminating luck from the game. In a fight between two people of equal skill, the determining factor in a fight should not be that one player got lucky and found a blue tactical shotgun, and the other got unlucky and found a blue pump. The determining factor between two players of equal for who wins should be human error, like wasting all your resources, or not properly timing a shot. In the case of a good player against a bad player, a bad player shouldn’t win because they got a better weapon out of luck than the good player. Sure, if the good player is good enough they can beat a worse player regardless of load out, but in the end the good player should beat the bad player without having to worry about if they get lucky from a chest. I think a good thing to do would be to decrease chest spawning, remove floor loot (except consumables), remove tactical and heavy shotguns, remove weapon rarities, give scars and famas the same damage as M16s and burst ARs (so players could have a choice between the two without one being significantly better than the other), removed all pistols (suppressed, hand cannons, etc.), make suppressed SMGs be actually silent (or at least quiet enough for it to actually be hard to hear) as the cost of less range and more damage dropoff than the regular SMG, make suppressed SMGs do the same damage as regular SMGs, remove P90s, remove heavy and tactical shotguns, remove scoped ARs, remove all snipers (including the thermal scoped AR since that is essentially a sniper rifle) but the bolt action and hunting rifle, make bolt actions and hunting rifles do the same damage (so that it would just be a preference choice for whether you take a BA or a HR), make sniper rifles only spawn in supply drops, and remove grenade launchers and RPGs. This is the only way to make sure the game is all skill based, and not luck based. The reason I say to remove grenade launchers and RPGs is because they are generally disliked and essentially do the same thing as grenades and clingers (bounce and roll, then explode, and explode wherever they land). Finally, to go along with all of this, I think they would need to introduce a similar system to a primary/secondary system, but rather than it being primary and secondary, you could have one medium ranged weapon in slot one (m16, famas, etc.), one close ranged weapon in slot two (a shotgun or an SMG), one long ranged weapon in slot three (hunting rifle or bolt action), and two consumables slots in four and five (throwables and meds). This would mean that near the end of the game, everyone will likely have about the same loadout, meaning that literally all of the game will be skill based, rather than luck based.

**Conclusion-**

Obviously I know that the majority of this will never be implemented (especially the last section). That’s why the title of this is “Fortnite will never be an ESport.” I believe that Epic will never take the necessary steps to be an ESport. Should they take the steps though? In my opinion, yes, all of these things would be positive changes. But since the majority of players are extremely casual players, they probably would hate these changes and I highly doubt that Epic would change this much about the game this late into the game, especially considering that most would dislike these changes. And that, my friends, is why Fortnite will never be an ESport. Good day.",FortNiteBR

tl:dr, my guess is that a k/d of 1 is top 2% of players.

I see a bunch of ridiculous answers to the ""what is a good k/d ratio"". The dumbest answers are that the average is 1. The number of posters claiming to have k/d of 4+ also beggars belief. Apparently no one can do math. Let's think it through.

In any given game there are 100 players. Maybe 10 die from self-inflicted storm and falls. So that's 90 deaths divided over 100 players. A mathematical average of .9 possible. This is divided over all the players with a clear subset of top players talking a disproportionate number of the kills.

I note that some 30 people are killed in the first 90 seconds. Most of these people die with 0 kills. Let's imagine that 5 of them get 1 kill before being killed themselves.

So that's 

5x1 kill

25x0 kills

Then let's start from the winners and work backwards-

The winner of the BR based on a very casual observations may have 8 or so kills. (The twitch streamers often have more so this may be low.)

But for the hell of it, let's estimate that the top 7 players have;

8,7,6,6,5 kills. Again this seems low to me.

Then let us theorize that are 5 players that achieve about 3 kills

10 that hit 2

and 15 that hit 1 each.

already we see that 100% of the kills are achieved by 40 out of 100 people.

That's 60 players with zero kills. it takes two kills to make up for a 0 kill round, and only 25% of the players managed to get 2 or more kills. Many of the 2 and 3 kill players were both lucky and slightly better than average. This makes me think those players will be lucky to get 1 kill their next game. On average.

With that math, only 10 players that hit 3+ have any shot at having an average higher than k/d 1

Based on this, I would put forward that any player that has a k/d above 1 is well above average. I suspect that a k/d in solos above 1 puts you in the top 10% of players.

If we also consider that good players probably average a high number of daily games, while poor players and casual players have a much lower number of daily games, this difference expands.

Another guess, but I bet good players play at least 3 hours a day over a week. 21 hours. Probably more, especially with twitch and full time players.

The average number of hours of ALL players, including those that play once a month, may be a couple of hours a week. if I'm right and that number is, on average, some four hours a week.

If so, this would push the greater than 1 k/d into the 1-2% of all players.

On top of this would be the real top players. Players with more than 4 or 5 k/d must be 100 times rarer than those with k/d over 1.

Here is my totally made up chart;

k/d

1 3% of players

2. .3% of players

3. .03% of players

\&gt;4 .003% of players

What does everyone think about my analysis. It's 90% spitballing, 9% guessing and 1% poorly done statistics, but it's closer than what I have seen posted so far.

Note: We could also try applying Price's Law. 

""Price's Law says that 50% of work at a company is done by a small number of people. Specifically, it says that 50% of work is done by the square root of the number of employees.""

It's a powerful predictor.

Price's law would say that of 100 players, on average, 50 kills go to 10 people. Of these, 25 kills go to 3 people. and of these 25, 12 go to one player. I feel like this matches my ""gut"" version above pretty well. Over millions of players though, is suffers from the limitation that it is impossible to realistically gather more than 10-15 kills per game no matter how good you are. But we can apply this ""law"" of results to individual games and then try to extrapolate.

OK - tear up my sloppy statistics, but only do so if you can propose a better solution.",FortNiteBR

I won my very first game (you've just gotta take my word for it), and I didn't even realize it, in fact, I didn't even kill anyone. I spent the entire game running towards the circle thing, and didn't see another soul until the very end of the match. The other finalist literally fell to his death from his ever-expanding sniper's perch, giving me the win. The little ""Victory Royale"" banner popped up, and I waited around until realizing I had to back out of the game. 

After that I played a few rounds of 50 v 50, which sort of felt like a game, but was still mostly just running, so I went back to solo. I tried to dive into the city-like areas at the start of the game just for the sake of getting some action, and got immediately steamrolled by anyone who found a gun faster than I did (not a complaint), getting me very familiar with the loading screens. After 30 minutes of loading screens I decided to play something else.

I've really tried to give FN an honest try on it's own terms, and didn't have fun. I found myself spending the majority of my time harvesting building materials and running. 

FN is objectively not a *bad* game, but I do find it to be a *boring* game. So I'm curious why y'all are so fond of it, genuinely. Do I just require too much stimulation (read: actual gameplay) from my games, or is there a mode with a smaller map I don't know about? 

To be fair, I never understood why Search &amp; Destroy was such a popular COD mode, and this is a very similar play experience, so like, maybe I just don't get it. ",FortNiteBR

My average kills on a game 4-7 kills. i tried to play on NA server ( 140 ms ping ) and it's laggy ( cant build fast + delay switching between guns ) and i get 7-10 kills easly per game. And to be honest , there are a lot of nooooooooobs playing on NA server ( doesnt build + hide a lot + potato aim .....etc )  No wonder players getting high kills easly . I use to watch nickmercs's and upshall's gameplay videos getting high kills 15-20 per game and they prove to me day after day that NA server is shitty compared to the EU server.  i know nick and upshall are good players but let's be honnest , noobs on NA server are helping them a lot ( not just these 2 streamers , a lot of NA streamers know that ) but they can't do the same thing on EU server. some of you may say that nickmercs play against pc players, it doesnt mean that all pc players are good there are a lot of noobs there too. For example : upshall high kill record solo vs squad is 21. When he switched to pc, his new kill record is 32 ( with helps of noobs ). And im sure even  if he had a lower or the same ping on EU server he will never be able to do it. 

More than 80% Players of NA servers dont care if someone is shooting next to them + they dont build to take cover + potato aiiiiim + bad positionning + and easy to kill them. Not like EU server players. You may still find noobs on EU lobby but im sure you wont find more than 15 or 20 and they die early. 
Anyway i wish i had a lower ping on NA servers , i would be famous right now lol",FortNiteBR

That being said as an average player i want to explain why pretending a 1.0 kd and 3% win rate is average incorrectly factors in the potatos or completely casual players.

Many players are just plain awful which had been said. On console they may not seem it where on PC it looks silly how bad they are. Either way factoring these players into what you assume the standard is for average is wrong.

Its good to work towards being average both in your stats, but more importantly in how you play.

Building has gotten nerfed. Build fights rarely happen, and when they do, they are easily shot out. Regardless of how you feel, is it time to release a “Classic” game mode varient?

Imagine if we had a Fortnite classic mode, where the game ran mechanically as if it was straight out of Season 2. Where building was the way to win, and shotguns still could one tap. This would be a pre-SMG, pre-Remote Explosives, pre-Sopping cart build.

I strongly think this is a good idea, and I think could be a really awesome game mode for those of us who have played since Season 1.

I even feel like defensive building has become somewhat obsolete. Before if you were shot in the back you could turn around to build a wall/ramp and be able to fight back. Now when you attempt to build defensively your walls are spammed and instantly shot through.

Want to build up to get highground? Quickly spammed to the ground. Want to outbuild the spam? You better have farmed A LOT, because half of these guns have 50, 100, or unlimited round clips.

I do understand this direction allows for less lengthy build fights or build spam (not sure whether or not this is a positive) but ultimately I feel like it's created a frustrating meta that rewards spray/spam and punishes both patience/accuracy and building skill.",FortNiteBR

As we all know, Fortnite on twitch is already super oversaturated, with thousands of people live at any given second. 

I am a pretty good player with a 7kd and I always try to do a “Sypher” commentary breaking down my deaths with what I could’ve done and what the opponent did well. Both for me to improve and for my viewers to hopefully learn a thing or two and start thinking about their own gameplay. I do this along with some funny/goofy moments when I fail or get shit on or whatever.

If this feels too long to read you can skip the first paragraph, it's just an introduction that's not relevant but I feel should be added.

I've played a little bit of every season (missed out on Halloween and Christmas Events), I started out on September 28th, 2 days after Fortnite Battle Royale became free. The game felt really choppy and gimmicky, not too pleasing to look at, and not very enjoyable to me which is to be expected with such an early creation, I left pretty quick. I come back quite a while later in mid-season 2 to play with friends who do enjoy the game, it's much improved but not enough to grab my attention so I leave again. At the start of Season 3, the game finally takes me in and I'll be there for a wild ride that's bound to come. Probably my favorite Season to date, holding some of my most favorite backblings, skins, pickaxes, and gameplay (will talk about this later). The point where the game got me spending money amounts I don't feel comfortable discussing. I've endured hardships and peaks throughout Season 3-5. I'm not disappointed with how Epic's treating their game, if it draws in new players and hypes the game, fine by all means, I just feel as if I'm stuck in a repeat I have difficulty getting out of, and it's become harder and harder to play and enjoy Battle Royale unlike months back where you couldn't get me to stop playing Battle Royale, I think there are many factors to that not involving the quality of the game such as the tediousness provided in constantly playing the game.

**The meta is constantly changing, and that's okay.** I'm fine with new things coming to a rise or being in the spotlight by all means, but it worries me when the new frequent changes completely switching around gameplay comes to a point where it effects those not as involved in the meta. Double pump reigned supreme for a very very long time, I'm most definitely fine in the spot it is now, its changes effected a less used but nice and useful strategy, Pump + Tac Shotgun/Tac SMG. This was my go-to for close-range combat in a different medium *high damage + finish* instead of a *high damage + high damage loop*. The introduction of the Drum Gun changed things up a bit introducing new strategies and new viable combos. You had a variety of options near the end of Season 4 and I feel this is where the game was at a peak (if I wasn't just mindlessly grinding endlessly for those Omega Lights maybe I could say more about it). Season 5 comes around the switches everything up about shotgun combat paving way for the new and currently superior **SMG/Drum Gun meta**, patch 5.1 only added on to this meta enforcing a new Compact SMG that could rival a Minigun's building tearing abilities and the vaulted Tactical SMG's fire-rate. It was a beast and may be one of the worst states the game has ever been in. Good job for Epic quickly making changes to this, but the new SMG meta still reigns supreme and I feel cornered into having to pair a shotgun and an SMG with no other options for close range combat as effective as that. Mid-range and Long-range combat is still great and I like the spot it's in. This change didn't effect me the most however, it was another change that has gradually been building (pun not intended) up over season 4-5.

**Building nerfs have hurt my game.** What started out in Season 4 as a few minor building nerfs has completely changed the game with the 5.0 and 5.1 patch, introducing new high fire-rate tearing machines and nerfing how strong wood structures are (arguably the most efficient building material for build battles). It is understood epic wants to introduce new strategies and change the course of the game, but it does hurt people who rely so heavily on certain mechanics for their game to only have them gradually trashed. Even though it's an over-exaggeration of some nerfs, it does highly effect what is made and done in the game. What has made the game least enjoyable is how the fights now go down. Usually both parties end up on the ground shooting at each other face-to-face hoping they can hit their shots (from my experience at least)

**Conclusion:** The game is fine as it is and continues to draw new players in by the daily, but it's become very unattractive for those that are being ignored and there might not be too much that can be about that. I know I'm not alone in this, and I hope others understand they aren't alone either. The game has done a lot of good for me, I used to fell like I had to surround myself with other people to be myself, but I don't and can feel comfortable playing alone or with others thanks to the experiences I've been brought with this game. I just can't fully enjoy myself with this game anymore, so I just hope others can learn to enjoy the game as much as I used to.

With consistent pellet spread you should be getting more consistent damage numbers the problem is you can also never hit the opponent with all the pellets (unless barrel stuffing) this means the damage to the body is effectively &lt;85

This is an even bigger problem when aiming for the head as it is a smaller target, you may have noticed your pump headshot doing less damage than a body shot and this is why! 

Solution: This may be unpopular but the pump and tac should both do more damage!

It only occurred to me to make this post because a bunch of my friends never play 50 v 50, and then the one time I got them to do it, I immediately realized why. With the way they were playing, they'd barely be making it to the battle by the time it's over. So a couple of tips to get the most out that mode.

- Wait for the circle to appear before jumping off the bus. It always comes up when the two busses are right in the middle of their paths across the island. Pick a landing spot that is within a short run from the circle. If you pick some quiet, far out of the way spot, you're going to miss all of the action.

- Don't go crazy looting. It's not worth it, especially for guns. My personal rule for looting in 50 v 50 is that once I find a couple of decent green (or better) mid range guns and a full shield, I head towards the circle. Whatever decent collection of loot you can accumulate from picking paradise palms completely clean will pale in comparison to the vast array of yellow guns strewn across the ground in the battle field. The only catch is that they're likely to be empty.

- Ammo is important in the loot phase. This is I guess one catch to my ""don't go crazy looting"" rule. Accumulating ammo is a way bigger deal than guns in the loot phase, and I can't believe the number of times I walk into a house or something, find all the chests have been hit and ammo cans are still intact. Like I said before, you'll have a wide array of empty legendary weapons to choose from on the battle field, but you'll need to show up with bullets if you want to use them.

- Personally, I also spend a little more time collecting mats in early game than I do in the other modes, as well. Once you're on the battle field, it's harder to do, so this kind of falls in line with the ammo point, I guess.

tl;dr- don't waste too much time looting. gather enough stuff to defend yourself, then get good guns from the massive (almost too big) amount of supply drops. ",FortNiteBR

My suggestions: 

* Traps, launch pads, fire pits, &amp; bounce pads still viable. ( I like this because all can be used effectively without building) 
* Your pickaxe can still break objects but no materials are gained. 
* Increased ammunition drops. 
* Greys, Green, blues, purples ONLY. (Gold may give the player to much of an advantage)
* ATK's spawns +++

How is it fair between PC player and console ?

My sugestion 

First , there is 1 classement for all console , why are we not using ALL player in the same server so PC and Console are in the same server ? Isn't fair ? Then the classement isn't fair too !

My second suggestion is to put a differant classement for PC and Console player.

Thing is, this is the 3rd consecutive showdown in which PS4/Xbox warriors dominate the leaderboards and good players,that are famous as well, are either not even CLOSE to being there, or are somewhere in 500+ range. Why is this? 

*Are PS4 players a lot better than PC players?* 

*Are Xbox players some Gods?* 

No, none of the above. PC is and will remain the platform on which you can demonstrate the most out of your skill/gameplay - this is a fact.

Now, I do not want to drop any accusations, but come on, you can't convince me at least 90% of the guys playing from consoles that are in top 100 in every region haven't used a keyboard and mouse.. I know Epic's official statement towards this, is that this kind of play is allowed and I am not here to cry for banning people - not at all. I would simply like consoles leaderboards to be put apart from PC leaderboards (just like in-game). *Why*? We're not playing on equal terms - obviously using keyboard and mouse is a *freaking huge advantage* (don't make me come up with examples,pls) over someone who is playing with a controller.

As an example, please check the first player in NA (I won't be naming him) - he has roughly 4600 points, but let's round it to 4500,because I am pretty bad at maths. So, 25 games while each game (only the game) can give you 100 points. Let's say he won all 25 games which is 2500 points. This by itself is rather impressing and I can assure you it's pretty damn hard to keep your sanity throughout these games as you know something is on the line. Now here comes the thing that is really upsetting me. He has another **2000** (two THOUSAND) points on top of his base 2500 (we're only speculating if he won all of his games). Since each elimination is 6 kills, we do the following -&gt; *2000 : 6 = 333.333(3).* These are the total eliminations we're assuming he had. Over 25 games this is roughly 13 kills PER GAME/EVERY GAME in a *""competitive*"" environment. What the fu\*\*?

This guy is probably some freaking monk in Nepal that has mastered the art of gaming over the past 20 years and just now he has decided to show the world his skills...

tl;dr different leaderboards for showdown events that will divide PC/Console top performers.

I don't want this post to sound like hating on someone, I just want some fairness. Thank you for reading &lt;3",FortNiteBR

The first is that if you truly grind to get the final skin of the season, normally the last 2-4 weeks of the battle pass (for me and my buddies at least) are just about pointless for the tiers anyway. 

The other thing is that while it normally should feel like an accomplishment to unlock the tier 100 skin, which is does, it is normally somewhat nullified by all of the people who bought all the way up to tier 100 or bought a certain amount of tiers from the start. 

My idea is to award the people who either earn their way all the way to tier 100 without buying tiers (besides the 5 provided from buying the last seasons battle pass) and to award the people who complete all of the weekly challenges.

I have seen people suggest this but never really seen any suggestion on how to reward them other than a new skin or such. My idea is to award them with a selection of an item from a past battle pass. I may be a bit biased on this but I know many people, myself included, who started playing in season 1 but didn’t buy the season 2 battle pass because, and I quote “It’s a free game, why would I pay for for stuff when I can play for free. ”  Then come season 3 we all bought the battle pass and multiple skins and emotes. 

It could be as simple as allowing us to get one thing that we would have earned had we bought the battle pass for past seasons, or it could be a matter of if you save up for a certain amount of seasons you could unlock higher up things that you hadn’t reached (black knight skin anyone?). 

I know this will probably get downvoted by the people who do buy their tiers or who bought every season, and it probably won’t happen since this would be a downside for people who pay more money and Epic doesn’t want that, but it was just a thought from someone who has been around from a very early date but kicks himself for not buying in sooner. 

TLDR: Reward people who don’t pay for tiers and/or complete every weekly challenge of the season by allowing them to receive rewards from past battle pass seasons. ",FortNiteBR

This should be a mini-game tipe thing were people could get a free item based on time limit:

* Emote
* Character Skin
* Pick Axe
* Glider

In the daily drow, items from shop could only appear there, so no items from events or something. It simply can start from picking a random card from a list or just by doing a claw machine. Maybe player could do a some sorf of the game to earn points and increase his percentage. This game would be free every day and if you want to re-try, you should use a couple of V-Bucks (=100). Skins could be for:

* 1 Hour 
* 6 Hours 
* 12 Hours 
* 1 Day 
* 1 Week
* Forever (0.1%)

I think this idea is cool and exciting. Tell me in the comments what you think about it :)",FortNiteBR

We spoke for a solid 5 minutes about our favourite skins(his favourite was raven), places to land and our favourite weapons and this young boy was amazed that a police officer had heard of Fortnite. He opened right up to me about everything that’s been happening and what got him to this point.

Epic is so confusing: let’s nerf double shotgun so the new players aren’t getting wrecked, and let’s nerf walls hp so they have a chance to shoot it down the make it a fair fight against good players, let’s add something that is super op for them so they can win, alright now let’s now have a competition so they can win vbucks against the best players in the world?

1. Nerf Explosives
- Nerf the building damage radius 

2. Buff Shotguns
- Remove timer when swapping to a shotgun
- Allow to do 200 or more damage with shotguns
- Revert to the Season 4 shotgun swap delay
- Change Pump Rarity to (Common, Uncommon)
- Change Tactical Rarity to (Uncommon, Rare, Epic)
- Pump Damage Buff (Common- 90, Uncommon- 95)
- Tactical Damage Buff (Uncommon- 73, Rare- 75, Epic- 78)
- Heavy Damage Buff (Epic- 81, Legendary- 85)

3. Buff Llamas
- Change the amount of materials from llamas (From 200 to 400)
- Change the amount of llamas per game (3 to 5)

4. Nerf SMG's
- Reduce mag size for the SMG and Silenced SMG (30 to 25) and reduce mag size for the Compact SMG (50 to 35)

6. Change Material Gathering
- Multiply the amount of materials per object by 1.2 (Ex. You hit a tree and get 25 wood from it in today's fortnite. In my fortnite version, you would get 30 wood. 25 x 1.2 = 30)

7. Change Building Health

For the people who've earned it.,"Since you're able to unlock season 5 exclusives AFTER season 5 is over, I believe it would be fair and genuine to everyone if a season one shop were added. This would be the original ""Season Shop"" -of course it would be retitled: ""Season One Shop""

Players would have to had reached the appropriate levels during season one to purchase the respective items. This means you would have had to been playing during season one and are indeed ""OG"" as the kids say. This would also mean that the portion of players that DID play during season one, and DID reach the levels to acquire rewards such as the Renegade Raider, will revisit a missed opportunity. (that they may have been more inclined to pursue if there were a legitimate ""Battle Pass"" for season one)

Many of us who played the game in that time were interested initially because of the ""FREE"" label. As quite a lot of us were new to buying cosmetics on a video game... (especially one that's FREE!)...(And in Beta)... We were not incredibly interested in spending money for those items.

Personally, I had just gotten to a point where I could win games often towards the end of season one. Getting better will obviously make you more interested in the game, and I feel like I hadn't enough time before the season was over to really get into the game. To the point where I'd feel like spending money was worth the satisfaction of owning a cool outfit. Obviously now we wish that we had coughed up the money after earning the level for the rewards. It was just a hard thing to do given how new the game was.

I firmly believe that 99% of the people who had the opportunity to purchase their unlocked season one items, and didn't - would do so in a heartbeat if given the chance.

\- why are ALL the skins based of a soldier type? would like to see some skinny or bulky characters too. (my guess is the balancing?)

\- would you like to see skills in the game? or maybe even roles in a squad? Maybe even a separate mode, so everyone is happy

\- personally I would like to have a quest tab ingame...I often forget what quests/challenges I needed to do...

\- Any love for a Riot Shield as an item? or would it be too OP? Even if it can ONLY be used with a Gun

\- Change the inventory, allow only ONE weapon of the same kind to be in the inventory (no 4xSMG or double shotgun...afterwards balance both)

\- Melee weapons...that are stronger than your pickaxe...probabbly would be a useless addition to the game, but I had tons of situations where I loved to have a melee weapons due to enemy stress aim.

Why not rather keep strong smgs in the game, while allowing players to carry two shotguns if they choose? This would give real diversity to play-style, and would be a fairly balanced meta!

The new smgs, in their nerfed state, all deal over 200 dps. Two pump shotguns deal significantly less, as it takes more than a second to get both shots off, and they each deal only 85 damage, best case scenario (assuming body shots from both the smg bullets and shotgun shots), leading to less than 190 dps from double pump. If two players hit all of their shots on each other, one with double blue pump, one with a gray smg, the smg will always win (other than when someone is hit by a shotgun with less than 85 health, in which case, either player could carry 1 shotgun, so again, the double shotgun has no advantage).

Therefore, why should players who want to use double shotgun not be allowed to, when current weapons in the game are already stronger than the shotguns? I would suggest leaving smgs in the game, and also allowing players to use 2 shotguns, to encourage real diversity of play-styles, and not force all players into either double shotgun, or smg metas",FortNiteBR

Keyboard and Mouse on console is ruining games, more so in the showdown mode this weekend, and highlighted in the recent summer skirmish won that caused so much controversy.

KB&amp;M gives a much higher skill potential and as such should be limited to those using the same. Happy for people to go out of their way to use it, as long as they are playing on servers where everyone else is too.

The great thing about console is that everyone is playing on the same hardware with the same input device. Which means the only influencing factors on whether you win or not is internet strength and player skill (insert comment about luck being a factor too). KB&amp;M ruins this.

Have epic commented on it at all? I would love to understand why they think it is fair in a competitive environment? And if it’s on the radar as something to look at, or if people like me just need to suck it up and accept we’ll never be on the same competitive level.

Why is no one trying to get Epic to see that we don't want spray and pray gunfights and we want legitimate skill - based guns for *AT LEAST* medium ranged weapons? Honestly when I'm trying to do at least a little damage to someone at medium range it's like my AR decides not to shoot properly. I understand hipfire bloom but ADS bloom is absolutely rediculous. No one should wonder why SMGs and shotguns are the meta when ARs aren't even viable anymore unless it's a legendary.

At least bring out an expirimental shooting test like you did with FSA and show us what skill based recoil patterns and aim is like in Fortnite.

Because seriously, I love this game, and I don't want to give up on it. But it's tempting me when other games have such good weapon systems and Fortnite can't even keep a consistent one for more than one season.",FortNiteBR

(Opinion),"Season 4 was a great season, and I had a lot of fun grinding my battlepass to get the tier 100 skin (Omega). However during the last season, you needed to also get to level 80 to get the full badass version of the skin. As of right now, I have an Omega in **MY** locker which **I HAVE GRINDED FOR**, yet only have access to half of it. What is this? Tier 100 skins are meant to show that a player has demonstrated skill (or lots of time) during the season (John Wick, Black Knight). I worked through the grind, and was rewarded not with a Tier 100 skin, but something of lesser quality. Please let us have the full Tier 100 skin, or at least let us continue to work towards one through XP challeneges. ",FortNiteBR

A lobby of 99 bots with three different difficulty types.

Easy - They don't build at all except to go after loot and build up to you, this only consists of floors and ramps. Will not seek out cover in a fight.
Normal - Can do 1 by 1's, Will hide behind structures during fights.
Hard - Can do builds consisting of all materials. To put it in simple words, this mode would really test your building skills in a fight. 

For Normal and Hard, I was thinking the bots would have unlimited mats maybe? But on death they only drop around 150 of either wood, metal, or stone on death? Just to keep it balanced for the player. Since the bots would need to pickup weapons and ammo, those amounts would stay regular. ",FortNiteBR

After several games with no improvement of FPS, I restarted my game, got the same popup, and same FPS crash.  
I was able to play at 100+ FPS on max settings no problem prior to this, but now I have to play on lowest settings to even get 100, thus making my game completely unplayable.  


I dont know if this is something I can fix, but it wont really matter if I can, I uninstalled my game because I literally cannot play it with frame drops going as low as 20 on the lowest settings. This is unacceptable for someone who plays most games at 200+ FPS no problem.

My thoughts on Fortnite.,"Hello, I'm going to make this as concise as I can. If you don't understand the context of this post then browse competitive FortniteBR.  
Explosives : I understand Epic has nerfed c4. But rocket launchers etc have been in the worst niche ever since the blast radius buff. Reverting them back to their original blast radius (1 build explosion) and capping the rockets at 20 would be the most suitable thing. Not only do they require 0 effort/skill to use. But they can also OBLITERATE everything you build. Clutching out situations in squads/duo's is basically impossible in this meta.  


Submachine guns : Having the fire rate of 15 shots a second, renders building almost useless. Turbo building walls isn't enough anymore. The common issue is that these guns seep through your walls. Buffing the material HP , Ending HP, And reducing the fire rate of SMG's would be a wonderful fix but still not enough.   


I understand epic wants more variety/weapon loadouts. But the fact of the matter is, this meta only cater's to casuals. Everyone running SMG's isn't variety. Please understand that I respect epicgames and the changes they do to their game. I started back in September and I have played every single META. And this one is making me enjoy the game less and less day by day.   


TLDR; Fix 'splodes , and please change this SMG meta.",FortNiteBR

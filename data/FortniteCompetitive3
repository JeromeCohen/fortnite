They just keep adding and adding items over and over again and fucking up the game and it tears me down to see the game that I once fell in love with being completely fucked by it's own company. I struck trough this game to all it's down falls, I still played when there was zombies that got added not once but twice, I still play even on console HORRIBLE preformence it has on console, despite all the bugs and all the bullshit this game keeps throwing at us, I struck to this game till this very damn day and I don't know how longer I can take this.

&amp;#x200B;

It tears me down because I want this game to succeed, this fucking game has the potential of  being one of the best games in HISTORY, I don't care what ANYONE thinks or says, this game has the potential to be one of the best god damn E-Sports and game that has ever came out, it has the potential but it's not being used. It's going the same route as my past loved game did, overwatch also had the potential of being one of the biggest E sports and video game out there but just as Epic is doing, they fucked their game as well. I want to enjoy this game, I want people to be happy, both casuals and competitive players, I want them to make both players happy so we can all enjoy this beautiful game but as time passes it's only getting worse and worse and i'm slowly losing hope. I don't want to lose hope, I don't want to doubt the potential Epic has but they only let me down as the seasons pass by. It seems that the only solution to Epic standing up and doing something about the state of the game is a competition, a game that competes with it and players will move to it instead, clearly proven when Apex came out, as soon as Apex came out just about 2 days after Epic tweets out saying they're nerfing the deagle, vaulting planes, fixing zipline, nerfing RPG, etc, things the community has asked for months but they never needed to actually care and do as the players told them as they simply didn't have too. They added siphon and a god damn free battlepass, they implemented the re-spawn van, the ping system and now the drones, all from Apex. I hate to face the reality and I hope to God i'm wrong but Epic seems to just be money hungry bastards, they don't want to fix the game unless they have too and there's another game people are willing to play but there isn't. Mark my fucking words as soon as a new popular game comes out and players will leave fortntie for it, watch them do everything we've been asking for in a matter of a few days.

&amp;#x200B;

 I doubt someone from Epic is reading this due to the language and aggression of my strong feeling of emotions but if someone is, please, in our heart we do love this game but people aren't willing to say that after all that we had to go trough but in reality we do, we truly fucking do, that's why we complain, that's why we still play the game and talk about it, we care, we care about the state of the game, we want to have fun playing this game both casually and competitively, please Epic, make Fortnite great again!",FortniteCompetitive

Dear Fortnite players,

For those who don't know me, I am Fortnite Analyst for Solary. As Solos WC qualifiers ended yersterday, it is time to share the work done over the past few weeks with u/AerocusFR about landingspots. These stats are the result of data gathered from \~100 uniques games for each session. (33% of final games). For each session, an heatmap and an histogram were build in order to find some landingspots trends between POI, and even within each POI (f.e. Pleasant Park, Paradise Palms, Lazy Lagoon...) 

*Heatmap* : blue corresponds to a low density landingspot, then it comes to white and finally to red/black (high density landingspot) 

*Histogram* : the blue value corresponds to the mean number of players within the POI, the bracket to standard deviation 

Please do not judge the form, as this work is non official, it was not supposed to be published at the beginning. As soon as Duos are over, the same work but for Duos will be published. I hope you'll find interesting things and that you'll be able to see all the changes in Fortnite that occured during these WC qualifiers through this work !

**Version française** : 

Chers joueurs de Fortnite, Pour ceux qui ne me connaissent pas, je suis analyste Fortnite pour Solary. Comme les qualifications à la WC Solo Fortnite sont terminées, j'ai l'immense plaisir de vous partager le travail effectué sur les spawns avec u/AerocusFR. Ces stats sont le résultat de l'accumulation des données d'environ 100 games uniques par session (33% des games des finales). Pour chaque session (demi-finale et finale), une cartographie ainsi qu'un histogramme des spawns ont été construits, dans le but de dégager des tendances entre les spawns, mais aussi au sein même des spawns (cf Pleasant Park, Paradise Palms, Lazy Lagoon...). 

*Pour la cartographie* : l'échelle de couleur commence dans le bleu (densité nulle), passe par le blanc, et termine dans le rouge/noir (densité forte) 

*Pour l'histogramme* : la valeur bleue correspond à la moyenne de joueurs, les crochets à l'écart type de la distribution. 

Ne jugez pas la forme, c'est un document interne, à la base n'étant pas prévu à la publication. Vous vous en doutez, mais dès que les qualifications en Duo seront terminées, les travaux la concernant seront aussi publiés. J'espère que vous trouverez des choses intéressantes, et que vous pourrez retracer les différents changements du jeu au travers de ce post!

Just wondering if anyone plays at a very high sensitivity and shares the same annoyance for low sensitivity players? 

I just don’t get it lol. To me high sensitivity seems worse because I cant aim as granularly and hitting flicks is way harder. But I get that that is most likely also to do with muscle memory.",FortniteCompetitive

We have examples of guys who haven't done well after losing their traditional landing spots (liquid boys and wailing woods), and others who can adapt weekly, like TFue and landing at the Block. Twitchcon and Katowice had major meta/map changes days before they started... Some performed well and other great players struggled hard.

Maybe someone has already collected similar data? I'm thinking something like knowing their average placements tourney to tourney, and seeing who has had the biggest drops in performance when the meta and maps change suddenly?",FortniteCompetitive

I’m sure most of you saw that he managed to get 50 points overall, with 30 of those coming in his final game. To make things more interesting, he only got his 20 other points in 2 of the other 9 matches. I wanted to see if there was a reason as to why this happened. I saw some people commenting stuff like he probably got combats in his two big games (although they were jokes), but honestly that could have been a possibility. Anyways I’m going to do a quick break down of his games and then a short conclusion.

Game 1: He tries to land on balls, but he is high and has to chase a ball that another player had tried to knock away. Because of his poor landing, he is unable to take early game fights and has to spend his time rotating in the ball trying to find loot in the southeast of the map. He is able to get a decent loadout including a tac shotgun after finding Happy Hamlet’s south portion unlooted. He has no mobility going into late game after his ball breaks, but Bugha saves him twice by using a launch and a rift. He lands height, gets a couple of kills, and finds a combat. Then just like magic his next five kills are with the combat and he gets the win.

Game 2: This one was pretty painful. He lands ball spawn again and rotates around to the south of Hamlet again, but his ball gets heavy sniped. He tries to keep rotating east and, of course, he gets heavy sniped in the body.

Game 3: I’m not going to lie, I thought this was going to be very boring watching all his games, but then I watched him get heavy sniped in the body twice in a row. Yikes. I didn’t mention it before, but he had fifty shield in this game and the last game. 

Game 4: Megga stays true to his drop and lands on the balls south of chair (although it is a spaceship or something now??). He actually loots inside of the outpost and then goes on his normal rotation, but one of the other guys that landed ball has already taken that rotation. I imagine Megga thinking to himself, “I am totally griefing this kids game for taking my loot.” Well, he catches up to the player and they hop out of their balls at the same time. Megga gets one tapped by this guys dual pistols.

Game 5: Lands same spot. 200 shield of spawn, finds a bush, and gets a drumgun. Goes on his normal rotation. What do you know, some kid is waiting with a combat. Megga’s ball gets broken and he is forced to take a fight with his incomplete loadout. To be honest though, I think he just throws this fight. Even though his opponent had a combat, Megga tries to jump on the kid and out spray him. He gets hit to 12 HP and then the other guy starts throwing stinks.

Game 6: Megga stays true to his drop, but after those prior four games he does switch up his rotation, this time heading north. He plays this game very similar to his first. He is stuck with a tac shotgun and only a ball for mobility. He almost loses his ball when trying to build in the fourth zone, but luckily Symfuhny is both deaf and blind and Megga is able to run down the hill he boxed up on and gets back to his ball. He loses his ball again by editing the floor it was on this time. He stares blankly at it for about five seconds as the lobby unleashes hell on it and it is destroyed within seconds. Probably would’ve had nightmares about that one if he wasn’t already qualified. He then attempts to W key a guy and gets two tapped by a tac.

Game 7: Same landing. Same rotation as the first five games, but he has to skip the first chest he goes too because another ball already go there. What do you know that guy got a minigun and chases Megga down who has 2 builds and an AR. This guy is just really unlucky.

Game 8: Same landing, but a player grabs a tac from inside and sprays Megga’ ball just as he gets in it. Megga isn’t even that late, but the player immediately runs out after getting the tac from the floor spawn at the door.

Game 9: Same landing, same rotation. This time, however, he places four walls in front of the chest he got sniped at in game 3. He gets up to 100 shield, but tanks storm to try and get some more loot. He grabs a legendary combat from an air drop. He then drives around in his ball trying to piss as many people off as he can by breaking their walls with his ball. Finally some kid has had enough and breaks Megga’s ball, so Megga hits this kid with some nice highly skilled wall replaces. He is fairly stacked for endgame, but he lacks mobility. He W keys Nickmercs and continues to play aggressive on other players, but he can’t hit his shots and even though he is getting walls for free. Then some guy decides to FaZe up after getting a shot on Megga and jumps through his cone and floor into Megga’s box for the kill.

Game 10: Most of you have probably seen it, so I will keep it short. Lands on a combat, game over. For real though, he scuffs his drop and lands chair instead. Gets a combat, AK, flint, and a rift. He uses the rift early trying to do the glitch, but gets another after his second kill. He actually just goes to another level this game. Manages to clutch after getting lasered to 9 HP. Gets tagged to 8 HP after that and still clutches up.this guy kills a dude with a canon, what. In the end, 15 kills with the combat.

Combat kill counter: 21
Total kills: 30

In terms of Megga’s overall performance, I think he just got unlucky. His rotations were not the greatest and he did make some questionable plays in games 4 and 5. He was probably pissed from the two games in a row where he got heavy sniped while at 150 HP. His deaths in game 4, 7, and 8 were all preventable in my opinion. He didn’t need to 50-50 a guy when all he had was an AK in game 4. Game 7 he needed to change his rotation after seeing another player already taking the same path. In game 8 he was lucky enough that there was even a ball left for him after being that late to his drop. I think he still could’ve made it had he boosted off the mountain instead of boosting towards his normal route. This allowed the player enough time for three close range shots to break his ball. Frankly, he didn’t play that poorly in these games though. He was just super unlucky off spawn. 

Although the kill counter shows he got 66% of his kills with a combat, I don’t think that is the reason for his success in those two games. He also had a combat in game nine, but only got one kill. I don’t doubt he wouldn’t have one game 1 or 10 without it, but that his lack of combat was not the cause of his failures. 

TL;DR: Megga dies off spawn a bunch because his drop simply does not have the loot for early game fights. He also just got unlucky with other players being in the right spots and hitting shots on him. His successes came while having the combat shotgun, but the lack of the combat wasn’t the reason for his bad games.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic listens to money, not disgruntled Reddit comments.","If you're one of the people saying ""this game is trash"", I hope you have *at the very least* stopped buying/spending vbucks. The only way Epic would ever make any change is if they continued to see a decrease in their revenue regardless of what ""casual friendly"" changes are implemented. People that continue to give Epic their money are straight up stating that they love and agree with these changes. A business is only going to listen to your money. If you hand Epic your money while saying ""this game is so bad now but I'll keep giving you money"" they'll laugh at you on the way to the bank. 

I quit this game when I saw the pump was removed. I stopped spending v-bucks when siphon was removed. I realize I'm one person and in comparison to everyone else I mean nothing, but the same can be said for voting. We all understand that a single vote doesn't change anything, but it's the principle. It's widely accepted that if you refuse to vote, your opinion on the state of politics literally doesn't matter. 

It's why the SaC code thing even exists. You think it was implemented because Epic felt charitable and wanted to share their wealth? Not the case. No streamer is going to tell his/her fanbase to boycott buying v-bucks until the game is improved because that also means the streamer loses money. It was an absolutely genius move by Epic. The one way streamers can make a real impact on the game is one where the streamer financially loses out. So they won't vote with their wallets and don't tell their viewers to vote with their wallets, because doing so conflicts with their own personal interests.

So if you're calling the game bad yet continue to spend v-bucks, whether you're a content creator or regular Joe on Reddit, your opinion doesn't matter. You're giving Epic absolutely zero incentive to make changes that *you* feel will make *your* experience better whereas Epic is worried those same changes would actually stop the money coming from casual players. The ""loyal"" players are still going to keep giving Epic their money regardless of the state of the game. The ""little Timmy's"" are going to leave for the next shiny thing as soon as they grow bored of Fortnite. So of course Epic is going to cater to them even if they weren't the 99%. Because they're the ones who vote with their (or their parent's) wallets.",FortniteCompetitive

The range makes it amazing for getting tags on people in the sky. And the rate of fire makes it way more viable in getting multikills. I think there would be a very nice balance between people and playstyles with two viable shotguns in the meta. Not that I think they would bring pumps back. But it’s crazy looking at the meta now and seeing how game changing this gun is. Maybe it’s just because it’s so rare. At least in the pump meta they were plentiful. Shotguns are such a important part of this game and they haven’t made good progress in balancing shotguns like they have for ARs. I feel I can make any AR work in my loadout and find all of them enough to have options. Having a combat will make or break your loadout. We need to have shotguns added and made to be balanced at the same power level as the combat.,FortniteCompetitive

Dear Fortnite players,

For  those who don't know me, I am Fortnite Analyst for Solary.  As Solos WC  qualifiers ended yersterday, it is time to share the work done over the  past few weeks with [u/AerocusFR](https://www.reddit.com/u/AerocusFR/)  about landingspots. These stats are the result of data gathered from  \~100 uniques games for each session. (33% of final games).  For each  session, an heatmap and an histogram were build in order to find some  landingspots trends between POI, and even within each POI (f.e. Pleasant  Park, Paradise Palms, Lazy Lagoon...)

*Heatmap* : blue corresponds to a low density landingspot, then it comes to white and finally to red/black (high density landingspot)

*Histogram* : the blue value corresponds to the mean number of players within the POI, the bracket to standard deviation

Please  do not judge the form, as this work is non official, it was not  supposed to be published at the beginning. As soon as Duos are over, the  same work but for Duos will be published.

I  hope you'll find interesting things and that you'll be able to see all  the changes in Fortnite that occured during these WC qualifiers through  this work !

Chers joueurs de Fortnite,

Pour  ceux qui ne me connaissent pas, je suis analyste Fortnite pour Solary.  Comme les qualifications à la WC Solo Fortnite sont terminées, j'ai  l'immense plaisir de vous partager le travail effectué sur les spawns  avec [u/AerocusFR](https://www.reddit.com/u/AerocusFR/).  Ces stats sont le résultat de l'accumulation des données d'environ 100  games uniques par session (33% des games des finales).  Pour chaque  session (demi-finale et finale), une cartographie ainsi qu'un  histogramme des spawns ont été construits, dans le but de dégager des  tendances entre les spawns, mais aussi au sein même des spawns (cf  Pleasant Park, Paradise Palms, Lazy Lagoon...).

*Pour la cartographie* : l'échelle de couleur commence dans le bleu (densité nulle), passe par le blanc, et termine dans le rouge/noir (densité forte)

*Pour l'histogramme* : la valeur bleue correspond à la moyenne de joueurs, les crochets à l'écart type de la distribution.

Ne  jugez pas la forme, c'est un document interne, à la base n'étant pas  prévu à la publication. Vous vous en doutez, mais dès que les  qualifications en Duo seront terminées, les travaux la concernant seront  aussi publiés.

J'espère que vous  trouverez des choses intéressantes, et que vous pourrez retracer les  différents changements du jeu au travers de ce post!

71,LeSamouraiNoir,1560176124,byyd7o,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/byyd7o/its_time_to_be_honest/,16,It's time to be honest!,"So yesterday, in my time zone, was my last chance for qualifying for WC; and here is my thoughts on how it went...

I've been ashamed of my country for the longest time, and as an answer to ""Where are you from?"", I would always respond with ""Somewhere in Europe"";

How is this relevant you would ask? Well! I'm from Mid-East; meaning I should play on Asian servers, but instead I am FORCED to play on European servers; I went from being ashamed, to raging a lot, to finally speaking up for players from my region... I've been playing this game for 15 months now, and I used to get around 100 ping in Season 3 to 120 in Season 4-7 and 150 since season 8; I've always adapted, no matter how funny that would sound to you, but I managed to adapt and make the best out of worst situations, I've won lots of local tourneys and am known to be a good player in my area; just because of the fact that everyone who participated played with around 120 ping, right? But when I look around I see people complaining about having 10 ping instead of 0... that's mad funny for me; I mean anything below 100 ping would be the dream ping in my current situation; Let me explain with an example...

So last night Aspect just qualified for solos, right? I'm super happy for him, bc I've been rooting for him and Animal for the longest time, but this final week, he managed to stay in an Air BnB, if I'm not mistaken, to get that sweet sweet 0 ping; Animal got better and better for sure, but we have to accept the fact that the ping also had a good effect on his gameplay; why did I even discuss this? First to shout him out for being a really good player, but also to state the importance of ping on one's gameplay; We have to accept that there is a huge difference between 10 to 0 ping, not to even talk about 150 to 50...!

The thing is we've been ignored and slept on for the longest time, and imo it's not really a ""WORLD cup"" if people can't compete from ALL over the WORLD; Where are African servers? Where are the Mid-East servers? Please don't reply with the ""They use Amazon servers"" excuse; that's like their oldest excuse on this matter! Fortnite is making millions of revenue every month, can't they install their own servers and be responsible? If not, shouldn't they at least give us updates on what things are going with ""Amazon buying offices in Mid-East?"" because I know that my chance of being able to compete on a fair ground has been ruined... however I manged to qualify for solo finals in week 9, but couldn't place well just because of the simple fact that I have delay on everything, I lose every wall to literally anyone on their first try, and my shots don't register sometimes...

I just wanted to share how I feel... I have nothing to do with people running my country or I had no control on where I was born... so why am I, and many many others, dealt with with negligence? If that is not discrimination, then I don't know what is...

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: Excuse my bad English, since it isn't my mother tongue language; and I thank you very much for reading this, it means a lot to me if you did... &lt;3",FortniteCompetitive

I tried using geforce now and it works very well except I live in mexico, so I get 60ping all the time. its a pain in the ass. I can also try and use bootcamp but IDK if my computer can handle it.

No singular gun in a game where you can carry up to 5 of them should ever be so universally powerful.

I think that stretched res is in-fact a benefit for players rather than a utility that will create disadvantages for others. Stretched resolution helps players increase their FPS when they play late game.  I have experienced multiple lobbies with storm surges and the FPS on my computer did NOT exceed 100. This is completely unfair for many players that have rather less powerful computers, ig. Console. Why did Epic mix console players with PC players? That is beyond me, and I am completely in pity for console players for having to compete with players that have better computing systems. Epic if you are going to keep console in PC lobbies in tournaments then atleast separate the two different communities. Console should never compete with PC. At that, give everyone the option to stretch their res to increase their FPS and their FOV. I mean for gods sake, with the current FOV you cant even see the players damn feet!!",FortniteCompetitive

Nothing is more annoying then having someone spam this thing at you knowing full well they don't even have to hit you in order to inflict 100 damage. This can be made worse if you're in duos or squads and multiple people on a team are carrying one. The following two changes are what I feel the boom bow needs in order to be balanced. 

- Nerf splash damage to 50 -

Pretty straight forward here, you shouldn't be rewarded with dealing 100 damage if you didn't even hit your target. In a game without siphon where heals are hard to come by...this is just to much. As it stands now the boom bow might as well be an RPG sniper that does slightly less damage. 

- Change ammo type to rockets - 

Something that makes this thing so OP is how much you can spam with it. Arrow after arrow can be shot without even needing to worry about actually hitting your target to deal damage. When endgame rolls around and someone is sitting on high ground or third partying with 200+ shotgun shells you can quickly see how this is a problem. I think the best way to fix this is to change the boom bows ammo type to rockets and put a cap on how much you can carry. This is how all other explosive weapons in the game are treated and the boom bow should be treated the same. This will encourage people to make their shots count and play smart with it rather then simply just spamming.",FortniteCompetitive

So let's say you drop off the Battle Bus with a bus fare of 3 points, and you land at an isolated area and, obviously, in Arena you'll always get at least one person contesting, and let's say you kill him fairly early.

You grab a Baller and box up around third circle. This is where the problem lies. For people who have gotten lucky and played aggressive, they already have profited points, so they w-key you.

I have so many maniacs w-key me mid game, and  I barely get any traps because the only thing you get in any game of Fortnite is Burst SMGs and Grey ARs.

And what is going on in their head to w-key when they could wait for top 25? Any tips as to how to avoid this? It's pretty annoying and there's barely any reason behind it, since kills are most profited towards endgame, so I need advice.

Vault it. It doesn’t belong in Fortnite, it’s playstyle revolves around the opposite of what you do in Fortnite to win.

Here’s the long version of it though.

It’s playstyle and stats aren’t made for current day Fortnite.

Back in the day, it was the perfect choice. No one built, so you could get a ton of shots off and an elimination since they won’t block it.

Now, it’s terrible.

First off, it has terrible range. Anything fatter than one block can’t do more than 30-40. It’s huge reticle doesn’t help with that, either.

It’s damage just doesn’t work out. Funnily enough it does less body damage than the combat, which is better than the tac in every way. It’s just not balance, one is just better than the other.

It’s playstyle doesn’t work either. Nowadays, people built after getting shot. The tac, however, shoots too slow to get more than one shot off after people build. You want to do as much damage as possible before that, and the combat is just better than the tac at that.

And Epic even tried to buff it, but it’s still the worst shotgun in the game. That should be a wake up call to replace it. Don’t just vault it, replace it.

It’s just an all around terrible gun. There’s supposed to be balance between guns, different types of guns shouldn’t just be better overall unless the gun has a really low rarity(grey-green only)and it’s just made for bad RNG, which I’m starting to think the tac is now.

This doesn’t mean that it should be changed. 

Let’s take a look at a World Cup finals endgame. Who is going to use a sniper in the last circle? Who is going to use a heavy ar in the last circle? Who is going to use a grenade launcher in the last circle? No one! Now who is going to use a shotgun in the last circle? Probably a lot of people. There may be some smg/at spray or even the occasional rpg, but the vast majority of Fortnite fights are close range, and you have to ACCEPT that,  and then build AROUND, and not try to change it. 

Making shotguns rare isn’t going to make people AR or snipe each other from 100+ meters away, it’s going to make close combat less skillful, and more luck",FortniteCompetitive

I must say, regardless of the ping disadvantage i rarely get my walls taken, but at the same time suffer from various delays. got **29 points** in Asia region on *300 ping* which got me to finals lol. 

To stay safe from attacks you just have to **plan ahead** of what the opponent **could do** if they get your wall, but also don't even let them attempt to take it. I usually branch out of my box to extend it regardless if it gets taken or not. **Holding the wall is just dumb** because I 'd be standing with my builds out while giving them a chance to break in.

You can fend off your opponent in so many ways, a quick edit to shoot or reset, again branching to the side, or even by pulling out a shotgun and shooting as soon as they break, and then hop into your other 1by1 . I'm only mentioning these because they **work** in a 150 ping players favor. These help me in many scenarios and the enemy fails to ever get my wall. If you **give time** to your enemy to continue *attempting* to **steal your wall**, then your chances to retain ownership reduce. Quick execution does the job.

Alongside that are a constant array of legitimate criticisms regarding bugs, updates, loot pools, casting etc. However, the 'little timmy' narrative is harming our credibility. We are not at odds with casuals and they would also like a fun game to play. Pushing for separate loot pools, decent ranked modes etc works in their favour also as it means they have a public mode that they can enjoy and even have a chance of winning.  But if we continue down the route of treating these players as our enemy, epic gets to continue with their shit which oftentimes neglects both comp players and casuals (see storm flip that requires a basic amount of thought to use that wouldn't occur to casuals but is game breaking for comp).

If we can show that our interests and there's align, then that would show epic there is major profit incentive to make productive changes and optimise the game for once.

# conclusion 

The competitive community understands that there is more than just us playing, but the increase of the amount of people saying that they’re quitting and enjoy it so much more is crazy, the game has gotten to the state where some of the casuals even agree with the stuff we say!?!?! Crazy am I right!?!? Casuals will play damn near anything they are given, I mean hell theyre playing a game mode that only has legendary weapons and the most op thing ever (infinity blade). They play this just because “it’s something new” which yes it is, but it’s also pretty damn stupid imo. I can understand that ltms are fun but half of these things are just so stupid that I really wonder what goes through the head of the players. So as a community, we ask, epic give us SOME attention, thank you for removing the storm flip from arena and World Cup, this was very much appreciated and it was a step in the right direction 

TLDR: casuals don’t know what they’re saying, they will play anything they are given. We want some say in what changes and don’t put the whole game base on casuals, also, FISHMAN GOOD GIVE ME UPVOTES!!! YAY GO FISHMAN!!! YAH BIG FISH GUY WOO HOO!!!",FortniteCompetitive

(Its a longer post than most) It took me 3 hours to research, think about, and write.**

# Items:

The items in this game are a **MAJOR** factor in why people are leaving your game and not coming back. Epic, you might think that you are bringing players in but 1 look at Google Trends can tell you that players are leaving. Here is a list of what should be removed and what should be brought back. Along with what should be nerfed and what should be buffed.

&amp;#x200B;

***TO BRING BACK:***

* Pump Shotgun - This was removed because it was most of the kills in the game, well now the combat shotgun is most of the kills. (from most players experiences)  (*the pump is still more balanced than the combat also btw)* This gun's removal caused MANY players to leave and if you bring it back imagine the amount of players that will come back.
* Silenced SMG - This is/was one of the **most** balanced guns in the game and it was removed for what? A burst SMG that is dropped immediately by everyone as soon as a slightly better gun is found.

&amp;#x200B;

***TO REMOVE:***

* Dynamite - I have absolutely no clue why this item is still in the game. It was introduced in patch 6.30 along with the Wild West items, such as the six-shooter. It destroys everything in a large radius and it is absolutely busted. If this is thrown in an endgame circle when you have 10 stacked up it is **INSANE.** There  is absolutely nothing you can do other than get blown up or waste about 900 materials.
* Stink Grenades - No explanation necessary here, you throw it and people take around 25 to 40 damage on average trying to get out of a 1 by 1 and into another safe area just by throwing 2 stink nades. They are broken and if you can manage to get a full stack of them, which isn't hard, you can absolutely dominate other players.
* The Combat Shotgun - 50 damage from an AR worth range? From a shotgun? Probably one of the lowest spawning items in the game? Fast shooting? If you have this gun you have one of the biggest advantages in the game. This gun is better than the pump. It can't 1 shot but if you can get multiple 90-130 damage headshots off with the fast shooting, they die just as fast.
* Burst SMG - Useless, no one uses it. Get rid of it, period.
* Semi Automatic Sniper - Seriously, of all things? This? It is a spam weapon that shouldn't be in the game. Just spam click with this and try to slightly aim and you can get multiple 75 body shots or multiple headshots. Have fun peeking with actually skilled snipers.
* Dual Pistols - Has anyone seriously used these things in over 3 seasons past the beginning fights? It just muddies the loot pool and isn't worth grabbing.
* Boom Bow - Oh my god. I absolutely hate this thing, along with the thousands if not hundreds of thousands that hate it along with me. A bow, that you see the trajectory of, that does splash damage, that instantly knocks off all shield, that reloads fast, that uses easy to find ammo. This combination makes for one of the most OP items **EVER**.
* Turret - Does anyone actually use this? Its the same situation as the Dual pistols.
* Common and Uncommon (Green and Blue) Infantry Rifles - They are completely pointless until you get to the purple rarity. The Grey AR is a far better gun than these two.
* Storm Flip - This was just added and should immediately get removed. The radius is too big and they do too much damage later in the game. Its just another tacky item for casual players to use and get 7 kills with in mid-game because skilled players can't do anything about it.

&amp;#x200B;

***TO BUFF:***

* The Tactical shotgun - It can't compete with the pump and it definitely can't compete with the combat. It needs a tighter spread, and I know that it will be harder to aim for little kids, but you can't cater to 10% of your players when the other 90% have major issues.
* Shields - Increase spawning of them. Its hard to find them and some times I don't find them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

***TO NERF:***

* The Drum Gun - Does way too much damage for what its worth. Just reduce the headshot multiplier and the damage per shot slightly and it will be okay.
* The Heavy AR - I know what you're thinking. Nerf the AK? I mean nerf its **STUPID** spawn rate. Every chest gives me a gray AK, I swear.
* Heavy Sniper Rifle - Its too easy, For a body shot, you can do 150 minimum with the purple varient. If you don't find a chug jug, Big shield, or slurp juice, which is quite often, you die a LOT. Reduce the body shot damage to maybe 140 or 130.

&amp;#x200B;

Now Epic, you may be looking at this and thinking i'm crazy, but the majority of players feel the same way. Ask most players and they will say season 2 and 3 are their most favorite seasons, that's for a reason. Those early seasons were the most fun, with double pump (which encouraged players to become more skilled and was a lot of fun) and there was no getting shot from 70 meters away with a shotgun and getting killed. You could actually get guns that you wanted and not Dual Pistols or another Grey Tactical.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Map:

The Map is too complicated and is so messed up. Its too easy to die to a player coming from Lucky Landing while you are at Lazy Lagoon and the first circle hasn't even closed in yet.

This is my steps on how to Fix the map.

1. Get rid of slip streams, they are too easy to use to escape fights and rotate easier.
2. Get rid of the airship things, again, too easy to rotate and you can just camp up there for an *extremely long time*.
3. Get rid of high up places that screw you over if the circle is half on them and are physically impossible to get up without dying FAST. **(Main example being Polar Peak, although that might be in progress right now, IDK)**
4. Profit.

&amp;#x200B;

# Quality of Life Changes:

We want an FOV slider. Please. Do Research. 80 FOV is bad for people with motion sickness. Many people prefer their FOV to be 100 or higher. All the biggest FPS games that have survived have one, why not this game? Please do your research. You want players? Well now you are getting rid of the ones that throw up and feel nauseous because of the terrible FOV.

Yes I know,

&gt;*"" We have no plans to implement an FOV slider. One of our major goals for competitive Fortnite is to support players in their journey to be able to become stars and build their own audiences around awesome performances and personas. Part of that goal means listening to the desires of their viewers, and stepping in when necessary. In this case, players were indicating they felt required to play with stretched resolution (or increased FOV) in order to remain competitive, and fans said that it was a negative experience to watch. ""*

But that is completely BS **(sorry about the impoliteness)** but seriously, most players WANT the FOV change, and its not like they are watching in Low-def stretch resolutions. Its just a different FOV. And right now those players that are watching can't even do that because of motion sickness. Also they felt compelled to play stretch res due to the fact that there was no FOV slider. It was the go-to thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Also please stop nerfing building, thanks. :)

&amp;#x200B;

# The Overall Message:

Would you rather cater to the casual players that only play sometimes and just mess around in team rumble? or would you listen to the pros and streamers and players that actually want the game to be good and enjoyable again. We are the ones that make up most of the game and community but our voices are unheard.

&amp;#x200B;

Just imagine making all these changes and tweeting them. The word would spread and the YouTubers that usually dog on you guys over at Epic Games, would make videos talking about the good that changed the game for the better. And all the players that left because of the pump getting removed (I almost left), the Drum Gun being too OP, the motion sickness problems, the people mad about the Boom Bow. They would all come back. The streamers, YouTubers, players, everyone would be happy that all this OP, broken stuff is gone and the things and mechanics that made the game fun and enjoyable were brought back.

&amp;#x200B;

^(also double pump would be nice :))

&amp;#x200B;

I hope that you can consider the playerbase's thoughts and change the game as needed because its not just me. Through this post I speak for everyone with these problems and complaints. This is what we feel.

Theyre free to play aggressive as they wish because turtling, especially when low health and trying to heal isnt a option for their opponent. Playing in the finals has taught me one thing, nearly all these players i run into have incredibly low ping and ive never lost so much builds before in my life. Every fight is nearly like playing at a disadvantage already. Even when being sprayed through your builds, when a player can constantly tag someone through their build even when theyre turbo building they already know they have lower ping.

&amp;#x200B;

Even pro players are moved closer to fortnite servers just so they can have lower ping and be given that advantage, you have someone like myth who was the first to move into the TSM texas house just to have lower ping, or Tfue moving in with cloak so he can have 0 ping for these last few duo qualifiers. Having 0-5 ping for these players gives them the confidence and they understand that a lot of times, the players they will be running into will have higher ping than them.

&amp;#x200B;

If players are complaining about loot pools separate in comp and everyone being given a fair advantage then honestly ping should be locked within the 15-30 range. Every little thing seems to matter in competitive fortnite due to all these features like building, editing, replacing building, shooting. Someone with low ping can take builds and shoot through turbo building... how is that even fair?",FortniteCompetitive

Similar to the RPG, the heavy snipe is a power weapon. Extremely powerful in the right hands and is a complete game changer

In my opinion, Epic should do the same thing with the heavy as they did with the RPG

The heavy sniper should be only legendary rarity, and it should only be available via vending machines and air drops.

Unless Epic nerfs the damage stats on the heavy snipe, then I think that the availability of it needs to be adjusted.

I live in Texas so i have around 30-50 ping to East or West. Having my walls yoinked from me constantly puts me in a bad position, it causes me to start wasting mats and continually  branching out, just to have another wall taken. 

When you have low ping edits feel better and you take almost anyone's walls. Taking someones wall is the easiest way to engage in a box fight. You put the other person in a bad situation. They start to panic and will start to make many mistakes. 

Whether that be edits, pressing the wrong keys, etc. I don't really get why they cant add Central servers or even more servers around the world! Africa has no server. A lot of people play at even worse ping than i do. I'm not taking my ping for granted. 

I understand that Epic games doesn't get to choose where the server are located but Rainbow 6 has central servers? I get 10-20 on R6

Its just upsetting having a disadvantage when you can't do anything to control the situation. No one should have to play at anything above a hundred. There is a big disadvantage just because of where you live.

I accidentally drop my shadows whilst looting it and he grabs them straight away. His argument was he was getting the loot I was leaving behind but i hadn't finished looting it. Why didn't he just wait until I run off?  


The rules state the it is against the rules to grief, which includes stealing ANY item at all. So after he takes my shadows i kill him to get them back.

And before anyone recommend Kovaaks, I do not have a PC yet.


I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong, I'm not sure if it's my sens, my binds, or what, but I really am not getting better and it's getting discouraging. I'll go into so more info below and maybe someone can help. I can actually do decent in build battles, I still choke a lot and mess up lots of builds, but I am decent at those. My long range aim and peak shots are getting decent, but my close range aim is horrible. If I'm in a 1by1 or even just near someone I will miss a full SMG clip and all my shotgun shots. For builds, I can do 90s consistently, I can do ramp rushes, but I can't really use my pyramids good yet, and I am not good at advanced builds. I can do edit courses really good as well. When I try to go into an actual game, I just can't do anything. I'm not sure why. If I'm in a fight, I miss every shot, choke every build, press the wrong keys, etc. I just miss when I was actually able to kill people and want to get better :(


So for starters here are my sens settings

800 DPI

0.100 X

0.070 Y

0.450 ADS/Scoped


I find myself being able to hit medium range shots when I'm ADSing, and also Snipes, but that's it. I do have a big mousepad, but I primarily use my wrist because it's more comfortable and I don't have a ton of room on my desk. So should I change something here? Faster, slower?



My binds:

I'm really conformable with my weapon binds (2-6 with picaxe as middle mouse button)

My other binds: (also pretty comfortable with these)

Q: wall

E: stair

MB4: Floor

MB5: Pyramid 

L CTRL: Trap

V: Edit

C: Crouch

That's the important stuff I think. I think my main problem here is crouch, I come from controller and used to crouch spam a ton, and I'm struggling to do that here. I have tried to use a pinky bind for crouch but I couldn't get used to it, maybe if I try longer I would though idk.


So I'm not sure what I need to change, but I am willing to do whatever it takes at this point because all I want is to get better. Thank you :)",FortniteCompetitive

All the little kids were going to school, and the pros who play for a living were trying out the game. Epic did not know that this game would blow up as it did, but they had a vision for what this game would be.

Everyone was excited to play this game, and epic kept adding changes that a majority of people (who were at least somewhat vocal) asked for. This went on until the end of season 4.

The start of season 5 was in the summer when all the little Timmies would be playing fortnite for hours a day. Epic knew that these Timmies were shit players, and decided to alter the game so that they had a chance at winning, and hey they might celebrate their wins by buying a new skin!

Epic ruined the game with the first spray meta in season 5, and the game seemed to be dying right then and there. However, after season 6, epic seemed to really make some good changes.

There were a few shitty items that were added around the time of Christmas (boomboxes and ahem... Planes + Infinity Blade), season 7 was an amazing season. We got siphon added into the game, we got creative which added a whole new dimension to fortnite, we got presents (only for a short time though), the suppressed sniper, itemized glider redeploy, and so many more good things. The beginning of season 8 was probably the best state the game has been in since season 4. No planes, there was siphon, we had weapons that rewarded quick building and editing (\*cough\* Pump Shotguns), the loot pool was diverse but not polluted with shitty burst smgs, and there were no insanely op weapons like the boom bow. Epic took a step back and thought about what the community wants, and they thought before they added items. 

That was until Epic added the baller.

This thing broke competitive, and many people spoke out about it, but epic did not listen, and now we see that people are qualifying by using nothing but the baller. Season 9 marks the first season to go through the summer in 2019. Epic has literally reversed every good change they have made. No more siphon, spray meta, weapons are not rewarding good building/editing, loot pool is polluted as fuck, ballers still exist, competitive is a fucking joke without a separate loot pool. stretched (used for higher FOV) is gone, and now epic has added the slipstream after saying they removed siphon due to (uNhEaLtHy aGgReSsiOn). Does that not make it easier to fly around the map and third party fights?

Epic has been giving us the shittiest reasons, and sometimes even making up bullshit lies (check their first reason for not adding an fov slider).

Epic will cater to the causals (I mean shitty little Timmies) during the summertime months, and they will actually listen to the community somewhat during the other seasons. Many people permanently quit the game after the first spray meta, and they didn't come back even though the game began to improve. This will cause the player count to significantly decrease every year until the game is basically dead. Pros are only staying for the money that Epic is throwing at their faces. 

I will probably quit after this season (My friends still play this game and I need to try and convince them to buy r6) just to avoid the rage and infuriation from reading every single patch note.

Have a wonderful day and good luck watching the shitshow known as the world cup!",FortniteCompetitive

With that said though, a slight buff to spawn rate would be nice.. it’s a bit too low... no need to target burst SMG though.. it’s a nice skill weapon.

It would significantly reduce the RNG aspect of off spawn encounters.  No more he found a shotty and killed me and all i found was impulses.  Now it’ll be an even playing field from the get.  Sure some people would still land chests for shields and others would go right for the elim for siphon.  But if you look long term, if everyone starts off with a shotty, guarantee, half the lobby would get eliminated before first zone closes.  The half that number between first zone and 5th zone.  Now you have 25 as we are entering moving storm phase.  That’s less strain on the servers and epic already said they are looking for ways to reduce player numbers endgame.

My native is 1600x1080 so what i would do step by step, is set my config files to 1600x1080, can also set this in the epic games launcher, under the fortnite command lines by using -ResX XXXX -ResY XXXX as example.

However, over the last year Epic you have managed to tear down the empire that you built. You have taken all the advice you have gotten from your dedicated, loyal fan base and chose  to ignore it. You created a game that was so good, but now you don't like that it is yearning to be competitive and have tried everything in your power to prevent it from reaching its full potential.

&amp;#x200B;

You have taken shotguns and made them only truly useful at long range (or blatantly left the bugged tac in the game even after countless videos and posts on the Reddit showing its bugged fire rate). You leave a shotgun delay in the game even though you have successfully eliminated the whole reason you put the delay in the game in the first place. You choose to focus more on skins than you do on simple bugs that have been in the game for seasons (i.e. slow glider glitch, traps not placing, etc.). You have tailored you game to the people who play 1-3 hours a week, rather than the core group of  players that spend hours on the game a week. No game has ever survived by ignoring the core group of players that support the game..... You add a ""competitive"" tournament and game mode so you can say, ""We gave them what they wanted-- competitive right?"" But then you have intentionally made decision that have killed the comp scene before it has even reached its potential. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what have you successfully done? You have killed the game that could be sooo good and created a ""could have been"" moment in history. Unfortunately, I no longer have a desire to play the game that I have put so much time into over the last two years.... Lets hope that you make the changes that we have been asking for over the last year instead of continuing to take  one step forward and 3 steps back. If not--- well I guess little Timmy will always have his credit card to buy those skins you keep putting so much effort into making....",FortniteCompetitive

After much thought and discussion, we have decided to test out a West Section for our scrims this coming Monday, June 10th, (the official start time on Monday is yet to be determined).

&amp;#x200B;

This ""West Scrims"" section will be on a Trial-Basis. Essentially, we will attempt to host matches for West players throughout the next week. During this week of hosting, we will continually monitor and review our player count, chat activity, and the competitiveness of this section in Atlantis. After review, we will see if any improvements or changes can be made, and overall determine if this is a project we would like to continue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Schedule wise, the times will be the same for West as they are hosted for East. So just switch EST to PST if you are curious what time games will be played, as well as what game mode will be played.  


Feel free to leave any suggestions or comments below!  


Thank you all so much, and let's make this work!

&amp;#x200B;

Recently I stumbled upon a video on YouTube called, ""How to Optimize Windows 10 for Gaming."" Of course, you will find many of these on YouTube and majority of them are completely fake or just do nothing. Recently, however, I was able to find one on my recommendations and it had a HUGE improvement on performance.

&gt;I do not have any proof of this, you will just have to take my word for it as I was not planning on making this at all and when I did the optimizations and all of that at the end I felt and noticed improvements. Here are my improvement's that I've seen SO FAR below.

&amp;#x200B;

* My FPS is staying at a constant 240 HZ in lobby, and only drop's down to 140-160 when jumping out of the bus. (*Before, it was nearly going to 80-90 which caused huge screen tears and audio popping.*
* My computer feel's smoother, and the video will go into the detail on why it does it. It also give's it a sharper look and it somewhat has reduced my eye strain. (I've noticed my eye's don't strain as much when just using this for productivity, but that could easily just be placebo or just me.
* Not only does the computer itself feel smoother, but the it also REDUCES your CPU utilization, and allows your gaming to run smoother. My computer has been bottle necking, and CPU usages have been spiking to 80-90 in the task manager. After, it went down a nearly 20%. (**Yet again, this is just what I experienced, I'm not saying this will ALSO work for you)**

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the video to see for yourself, and I hope you find it helpful:  [VIDEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJTCwSX9Ym8)

All of your feedback has been effective.,"Well you’ve done it.  All of your negative constant bitching about the game is having an effect. 

I was hearing some 10 year olds talking about fortnite and the conclusion was that they didn’t like it anymore.  I jumped and asked why and also got a sense of how good they were.   The conclusion was that the game was in the worst state and that it was dying and that epic was doing a bad job.  At the same time they weren’t very good. At most a few kills per game.  And they were very excited when describing all the skins and dances they had.  And they were even excited to talk about the last win they had.  But they weren’t playing it anymore because of reasons that have absolutely no effect on them.  So I asked where they got their opinion from. And the answer was the youtubers and twitch streamers.  A few names that came up were thatdenverguy,  mongraal and a few others.  


So listen up you knuckle dragging morons.  The entire reason there is money for completions and for your fucking sac program which you pitch everywhere you can is because of those kids wanting to be have the same gear as their favorite people to watch and their friends.  It’s what pays for the whole program.  Comprende?  

And now those kids have moved on because you convinced them that this game sucks.  And is dying.

I can think of a better IQ test.  And you are all so incredibly dum.  I personally used to like denverguy when he did play analysis but now he’s just s trash clickbait gossip YouTuber.   Can’t stand watching him anymore. But he’s having an effect.   What a dummy.  

I managed to tell these kids that those streamers are just really dumb and that there are better people to watch and I gave them a few options and to not stop playing because of a bunch of stupid people who clearly can’t think straight.  Maybe it worked. I don’t know. 

In any case. To all of you with an audience that are constantly slamming fortnite your toxicity is working.  Well done.  Make no mistake ...   the only reason the vaaast majority of you have an audience is because of this game and you are a fool to think your audience will follow you long term to another one.   Proof is when apex came out and loads of creators moved over -they had a very rapid decline in video views for that game and other fortnite streamers picked up increased numbers.

But this is not a one off rant, this happens way too much, to the point where if i land at a POI and i hear someone cock a combat that i do not want any of that fight, in pubs it isn't too bad if you run into the average player, but anyone above that or in high level arena, i just do not fancy my chances.

I loved this game. Played since Season 1 Day 1 and have spent thousands of hours, and probably thousands of dollars on the game. Supported the game at every turn and defended it in earlier seasons. Ignored other games that have come out to continue to try and improve and hone my craft. Just to get slapped in the face by Epic over and over and over again. 

This has got to be the worst and least skillful meta in the 2 years of the game.  The addition of Timmy weapons like the boom bow, combat shotguns, un-vaulting of the drum gun, Ballers etc etc etc....

I had a World Cup Qualifier game today that got down to 13 people. After I died I stuck around to watch for a moment. Only 2 players were not in Ballers. Everyone was watching from their Balls as the two players had a build battle and the other 11 players were jokingly plunging each other. 

This meta is one in which the best player in the world, Bizzle, can qualify for Sunday in the top 500, without shooting a single bullet. One that vaulted the pump shotgun and replaced it with the combat that shoots three times faster and does 360 damage in 1 second and can hit for 60 DMG from a football field away. In seasons past you had to have a multitude of skills to be successful. Fighting someone was actually fun. Now, if you don't have a combat shotgun (8% drop rate btw) you're absolutely screwed if you run in to a good player that has one. Every controller player has a name like EVAN SPAMS L2. F.O.V. has been locked to a ridiculous 80% and you can't even see your feet. The audio is the worst it has ever been and someone with better ping than you is going to take your wall and there isn't shit you can do about it.

The worst part of all of is that it will not change as long as people still buy cosmetics. There is no reason at all to give in to the demands of Competitive community while Epic makes money hand over fist. 

All the fun has been sucked out of this game. A lot of you will probably say I'm just bitching and salty. You are absolutely correct.",FortniteCompetitive

1. Chests always spawning will reduce the times where you land in a house and it has no weapons, which normally ends with a death.
2. Players will be able to strategize their landings better if they know that chests will always spawn.
3. More chests = More loot = More chances that players will get their desired competitive items/weapons.

Or instead of removing the baller. Which leaves you completely invulnerable to damage while having huge speed and momentum. And can collect stuff from the ground. Grapple anywhere. Easy high ground


ATK is just the perfect mobility vehicle you are vulnerable while you are using it. Unlike the baller that is way faster and can go anywhere due to its grappler. ATK has a good speed. Not an op speed. Like flying in the sky from one side of the map to another in seconds. 

You can carry an entire squad with an ATK too

I currently am using a Logitech G Pro keyboard and I was thinking about getting the Ducky One 2 Mini. For me the switches and keys on the G Pro seem somewhat unresponsive in that it takes a good bit of force to press a key and their actuation seems to be pretty high, especially keys like L-shift and L-ctrl that I have to press with my pinky finger. Obviously I just need to be able to press all of my build and edit binds really quickly and I heard that the One 2 Mini is perfect for that. I was wondering if getting a One 2 Mini would be worth it, as I see a LOT of pro players using them.

If this would be a worthwhile purchase, what switches do you guys recommend (I heard the MX Browns were best but idk)? I don't really care that much about noise, I just want the most responsive ones.",FortniteCompetitive

What finally made me uninstall was when they removed stretched cause I just cannot play without anymore, and then their dumbass statements on siphon and it. It made it completely clear to me that this company is braindead and wants to caters to casuals for next 3 months of summer than drastically as new games come out, the game fucking just flops. It just dies out. 

Little Timmy with the attention span of a walnut got bored by then of the updates.

Average Player Jonathan just stopped caring

Pro Player Chad brings in more viewers on the new games coming out

I’m betting around late October, or early November is when you see the game finally pick up again but honestly I don’t think people are gonna fall for the power move again or care, like we did for siphon and stuff in S7 when apex came out.

So my question is though, why do you guys keep playing? We all know the game is dogshit, comp fortnite literally is a joke especially now after that storm flip shit, constant bugs never patched, etc etc etc, everyone knows the story.

You’re literally all just forcefeeding yourself shit you don’t like, and I promise you if you were addicted like I was, you’ll quit and wanna play again for like a week but just try and reject those feelings and it’s so much better not having to think about what shit Fortnite is doing next week now and raging, if that makes sense.

Just please if you hate the game, just give it up, I’m sorry that sounds negative but I just want everyone to stop forcing shit they’re addicted to but don’t like, when they don’t need to.",FortniteCompetitive

Loot -

The constant changing of items and metas is what keeps this game interesting. The game changes testing the best players to adapt and change with it. You can complain all you want but either adapt and evolve or die to your legacy techniques.  As both a competitors and viewer of competitive play I love the constantly changing competitive experience which tests both my and pro players ability to adapt to new items and rely on fundamental skills (aiming, building, and editing) 


End Game -

Having a high population of players in end game creates sub-par performance for players in these small overcrowded circles. Fixing the performance in these scenarios is probably INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.  It will not happen overnight so measures have to be taken to reduce players in these circles or players building in these circles Ex. Ballers, storm flip, heavy snipers. Don’t you think if performance was easy to fix epic would do it? Do you think they like seeing posts on social media from pros showcasing bugs? I doubt it 

Complaining on this Sub 

I’m disappointed at how much complaining about one thing or another happens in this sub.  We as a competitive community have the opportunity to be more constructive with our feedback so the developers have less shit posts and noise to sift through. 

Epic Games is a Software Company

Fortnite is a Video Game in their portfolio(and largest revenue stream) 

In all software their will be bugs and features which some users are satisfied or indifferent with and other users are frustrated with. It’s just the nature of software. We as a sub could do a much better job at providing feedback to the developers but looking at the complaints I read I generally could break them into two categories.

1) Feature Requests - This weapon does this, I think it should do this, FOV Slider, etc. 

2) Bug Reports - this feature is supposed to do this, but now this is happening.  Using actual videos is much better than you writing a text post that said you died 5x to this bug. How about your post your five clips or not at all?  Can we stop the shit posts? Can we focus on providing evidence based feedback? 


Little Timmy - 

There is so much hatred in this sub towards “Little Timmy” Every time I read someone mention “Little Timmy” I think they forget they might have been “Little Timmy” once. GoldenEye was my first exposure to a multiplayer shooter and until I was a few hundred hours I was a bot. For many young kids Fortnite is their first multiplayer or first video game period. They are a legitimate and possibly majority portion of the population of fortnite. 

Fortnite’s success is built on how Little Timmy + Tfue(and other pros) and everyone inbetween enjoy and consume fortnite. As a result the game is developed for everyone and it’s not unreasonable! 

Building and maintaining multiple code bases is very difficult in software when you have multiple code bases you need multiple rounds of QA and this complexity adds time and money to the development process.  Obviously for a company whose trying to make money above all else, focusing on the bottom line is key to success.  

This also creates a scenario where little Timmy in his pub can feel like he is Tfue every time he gets a kill, even though Tfue is dropping block on World Cup Sunday, and they are getting a few games in a pub on a Wednesday afternoon.  


Can we try to make higher quality posts with evidence of claims?

Can we be nicer about Little Timmy?

Can we be nicer to the developers who are slaving away each week to make the ultimate battle royale experience we are all addicted to?

Friday fortnite is fast action packed for duration of the game simple to follow and love or (mostly) hate keem the format of having most popular streamers play is more engaging than largely unknown pros to many 

I’ve watched a lot of fortnite competitive and Friday fortnite for me FF holds more memory’s of wow moments than competitive fortnite, ninja vs faze, nikmercs getting sypher to break truck he was trapped in and going on to win FF stand out more than most fortnite competitive highlights it’s simply more unpredictable other than a couple of end game 1vs1’s in fortnite competitive 

These are just my observations as a casual, whilst I appreciate the skill involved in fortnite competitive it just isn’t overly watchable and for all the comments in here about camera cuts, commentators, lack of scoreboards I’m not sure it’s ever going to be watchable for most casual observers as the gameplay largely isn’t overly entertaining and most sports are an entertainment product which is exactly what FF aims to be. 

I hope fortnite competitive can turn it around but the low ttk between pros who can defensively build expertly and lack of reward makes it unadventurous to fight early game and just leads to mad blur end game where no one can keep up with what’s happening 

The unwillingness of the community to accept items that are anti build (which I understand, everyone hated a scrub with a boom box that denied building) would lower ttk and make early game fights quicker and hence a less congested late game, but I just don’t see a change in meta where final circles will have dramatically less people as the risk/reward doesn’t exist and won’t exist without major gameplay changes which the community would oppose",FortniteCompetitive

Innocents is clearly the better player, and everyone is calling ZaynSzn a bot, but I don't think it's a good look on Innocents to be honest. He's refusing to allow traps in the 1v1, and basically verbally shitting on Zayn in his chat/stream.

&amp;#x200B;

Am i the only one who thinks that it's kind of low for Innocents to be doing this? First off, I could be wrong but didn't Innocents massacre in the WC qualifiers? He's clearly the better player and it's not even close, so just like in golf I don't think giving someone a handicap is unfair.

&amp;#x200B;

Second, Fortnite is a game of chess. There are a lot of plays and set ups you have to be careful for so you tread cautiously and avoid any traps or situations that the opponent might be luring you into. I  think having 150 traps is probably excessive, but in late game scenarios it's probably not unrealistic that someone may have 5 traps or so. Personally I think Innocents is giving himself to much of an advantage (he's essentially the better golfer and giving himself a handicap) by taking out an element of the game. It's like if I were playing chess and I said take out rookies in the game bc i know my opponent is good at with rookies.

&amp;#x200B;

And then he literally just talks shit on Zayn. I've never watched Zayn so i don't know if he's just a troll in the fortnite community or or what but i find it kind of small of him to be stacking the odds in his favor.

Most points after 5 games wins
Scoring:
1st = 3 points
2nd = 2 points 
3rd = 1 point

I would also, at random choose one player to be entered into next week's games for free, and I would pay their buy in :). 

At the beginning the buy in would be small, to build trust and as we gain popularity and better quality players the buy in would increase and thus the prize money. I currently have a Fortnite Insta Page with almost 5k followers and a few have shown interest.

Many of us have been here since the very beginning, and so we've been through all of their shenanigans. Hell, you don't even have to have been here since pre-S1, as we have a ridiculously controversial patch every now and then (comp wise, especially). You'd think that at this point, one wouldn't even bat an eye at an absurd patch, right? I thought the same thing, but apparently that's not the case. Today I found myself staring at the patch notes in disbelief and thinking to myself: ""How is it possible that they *still* manage to surprise me with such shitty updates?""

Sure, they prioritize (by far) casuals; but is it really worth shitting on the entire comp community that badly?

A few minutes ago I took to Youtube, and [this is what I found on the top of the trending page](https://i.imgur.com/zPVopRC.png). The Storm Flip trailer is trending at #2 trending Worldwide (not just in Gaming!), with an amazing like/dislike ratio (hell, who knows, might have reached #1 and I have missed their peak).

This pretty much seals it for me as far as the answer goes. It's more than clear that casuals really enjoy some of these new items (and sure, why not, it can be great fun). Or, let me rephrase - it *has* been clear, for a while now. however, and perhaps I'm only on this one - this trailer has helped me realize to what extent.

[I made a thread about the loot pool and how there is honestly no good, apparent reason to refrain from that a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/bvbi2n/fortnite_competitive_ama/) (win-win, as I put it). We've all were looking for Epic to address this, and during their last ""comp"" AMA, Epic Games has stated the following:

&gt;Q: Are you guys considering a separate loot pool for Arena/competitive?

&gt;A: Not at the present time.

&gt;Having the same core battle royale game played by players of all skill levels is healthy for the overall state of the game and keeps competition open, approachable, and for both players and viewers.

&gt;We aim at one game, however we occasionally make exceptions (such as Siphon), but our threshold for branching core gameplay is very high. It's up to us to find new directions for balance that reward players at every skill level, while not creating negative experiences for different groups. [...].

That is the reason that our voices should never be directed towards ""please vault/ nerf."" The trailer proves to what extent Epic Games benefits from these ridiculous items, so it will only get worse and worse as time goes by. The more players leaving the game, the more desperate Epic Games gets, which directly equals pushing more and more new items (meta-shifting ones, as well) and make it feel more like a brand new experience to attract new players and old, alike. 

Asking for a nerf is not the right answer, or at the very least, not the permanent one. Again, Epic Games could not care less about the comp scene. At this point I simply refuse to believe that they have such poor foresight. Upon ridiculous patches, **I also used to rant/ think to myself ""how come they haven't play tested it?! It seems so obvious!!"" That's exactly the point - it very much *is* obvious - they know it. They simply don't care. Asking for a nerf is a lost cause, because it won't be significant, and in the event that it is - the next ridiculous item will just take its place. It's an endless loop.**

It's more than obvious by now that it's literally impossible to accomplish what Epic Games looks to achieve. You simply can't balance both games together, due to the simple fact that casual and comp are completely different animals. It's not like in CSGO or Overwatch, where a balanced item is healthy all across the board, no. In Fortnite, due to special layer of buildings, the game becomes completely different competitive-wise. IN other games, the game looks exactly the same thing, but with greater skill (CSGO - same 5v5, only the pros are doing it better). In fortnite it's day and night! End zones are not a thing in casual, and that means that balancing the game and make it suitable for both casual and comp will *never* be a thing. Simply never. It's either separating the loot pool, or coming to terms with the fact that this only get worse and worse, and RNG will take even more aspects of the game on a regular basis.

**TL;DR** (although I'd much rather if you read everything) please refrain from asking for items to be nerfed/vaulted. Ask for a separated loot pool. That is the only permanent and reasonable way. The last hope (albeit it seems impossible), is for Epic to reconsider their stance on that matter. Otherwise, We either have to make peace with the deterioration of comp Fortnite, suck it up and continue, or quit. It will never ""get better.""",FortniteCompetitive

It had and still has enormous potential to be one of the greatest esport games of all time but that is currently not a priority for Epic and it may never be. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had played this game since season 2 putting in god knows how many hours over that time.  I started to notice a few months ago that i was finish my gaming sessions in a bad mood.  Sometimes i would be so upset that I found myself projecting my frustration to the people around me when i was done playing.  As time continued to go by i noticed that i was complaining more and more when i played the game.  I would be eager to play but the second i started i would complain about something and then get angry.  Most the things i would get angry about were balance issues with the game and the decisions Epic was making including the ever growing list of  bugs they continue to ignore.  I finally realized that i was addicted to this game.  I was signing on to play a game every day that would leave me feeling upset and angry when i finished.  I was mainly a solo player so i thought maybe its because im playing solo so i started to play more duos and squads with friends but i would have the same feelings during/after those games as well.

&amp;#x200B;

A little over two weeks ago i stopped.  I have not played the game since and i feel great.  I have been playing other games with and without friends and find them so much more enjoyable.  This could be easily written off as burn out but i do not think that is the case.  The changes epic has been making the past 1.5 seasons or so is changing how the game is played.  In my opinion its changing it in a negative way but I know not everyone will agree with that.  Ever since i have stopped playing I have noticed my mood has changed a lot.  I am no longer angry and frustrated after my gaming sessions.  I am not in a bad mood that i push off onto the other people in my life anymore.  It really has been great.

&amp;#x200B;

I am not saying i am quitting fortnite forever but i realized that there are other games out there and why should i force myself to play a game that leaves me in a bad mood both during and after playing.  When epic makes some reverts and changes that i feel are healthy for the game ill more than likely return to play it again.  What i am saying is that if you have these negative feelings when playing the game or after playing you should try stopping because more than likely you are simply addicted.  Take a few days off and see how you feel after that.  The first couple days you will probably be anxious but after that you might notice the difference in your mood. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its just a game.  I still agree its one of if not the best game currently available but even if it is why play it if it just puts you in a shitty mood?  Just because a game is great doesnt mean you have to play it.  If you dont like the changes Epic is making take a nice break and wait for them to make changes that you do like.  When they do fire up the game again and see how you like it.",FortniteCompetitive

That was the most important thing that I found out when testing with them in creative, since most people thought that was a thing. Here is some more information about the new storm flip:

The time from it exploding until it reaches its maximum radius of 4.5 tiles is exactly 10 seconds.

You can outrun this expanding circle, as it moves slower than sprinting speed.

It lasts for another 10 seconds and then a siren noise plays and after another 2 seconds it starts to shrink. It takes about 1 second to fully shrink and disappear.

Storm Flips do not stack damage. They act like stink grenades.

You can hold 1 storm flip per item slot.

The first point also applies when it is thrown into the storm. If you are inside a storm flip in the storm that is keeping you safe and someone throws another storm flip at you, you will still be safe.",FortniteCompetitive

But at one point its just so messed up. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine you are in the last zone, and you have ultimate highground. You throw down the storm in a bottle thing and boom! Everyone is dead because of a new storm that lasts for 20 seconds and covers a very large space. If multiple storm in a bottle things are thrown, you basically can't tell where the safe zone is and where the storm is. Competitive endgame is already chaotic enough, just imagine trying to navigate an elaborate maze of storm borders. 

&amp;#x200B;

Imagine that the storm has fully closed, and there is 2 people left. One is at highground and the other at low ground. Both players place campfires and it is a battle of who had more health before the final safe zone ends. But now, if little Timmy ever makes it to final 2, he can just place down a storm flip and basically be immune for twenty seconds, more than enough for the other guy to survive.

&amp;#x200B;

The removal of the hunting rifle is also messed up. Pretty much everyone would agree that the semi-auto just sucks. And for people complaining about getting a hunting rifle early game, you can always stuff your barrel in. The hunting rifle was a fun weapon to use in pubs that rewarded skill and accuracy, and Parallel bois loved using it.

It's actually a good idea- take the top-skilled players that are great at adapting to win- and just keep throwing crazy items at them and see how they play. This is why they added the new storm item- who cares if it completely changes how comp fortnite is played? It's fun to watch how these players with thousands of hours invested respond to it .

Even though this ruins the competitive integrity, it doesn't matter because they don't care about that- they are looking to advertise a diverse game with unpredictable plays and action-packed events.

This explains why they don't change the loot pool for comp. Also why they add the sword the day of the Winter Royale, boom boxes, planes, the turret, today the storm flip, and the list goes on and on. It's fun for the majority audience who don't care if the most skilled player wins, they are just looking for things that are exciting.

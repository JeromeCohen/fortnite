So after about 20 solo's since yesterday I now know why everbody hates planes so much since they third partied me in almost 50% of my mid game fights.
Unfortunately I don't expect epic to remove them anytime soon, so I'm wondering, what is the best way to deal with them?
Should I try to disengage completely?
Should I focus on destroying the plane?
Should I try to jump onto it when it wants to crash into me for an easy pump elim?

How do you guys deal with them?",FortniteCompetitive

you have basically no time to heal so you dont get rewarded for having loot;

it gives mobility items even more strength than they already have;

it forces running and building and fighting fights, or even avoiding enemies because you know you cant fight them;

In the last couple of weeks though, it's like I've hit a wall. I can't even remember the last time I got a win.  I'm getting outplayed by everyone and I can't seem to figure out why I've turned into a bot overnight. I'm missing my shots and my edits are sloppy although I always warm up (warming up my builds and edits are decent) before I load up public matches.

Has anyone else encountered this before and if so, how do I fix this? Would it be smart to just take a break from the game for a couple of days or just sit down and play until I finally get a win for motivation to keep playing and trying?

I should also mention I try to land at populated areas where early game deaths are to be expected. But even if I try to land at places where other people don't go to as much, at some point in the game I run into a player who I can't even hit with my shotgun.

So for some background info I'm a ps4 player and I'm ok at the game but am really trying to get better. I used to play competitive COD and was a high level R6 Siege player so I feel like my shooting skills are definitely above average but like a lot of people I struggle with building. I basically always will pick up a grappler when I see one because it's the only way I can consistently win build fights. 

Up until about 2-3 months ago I almost exclusively played duos or squads because fortnite has been a mostly social thing for me to connect with friends. But now I've started playing a lot more solo games and I'm doing well. Have gotten a few pins in the tournaments as well. But I feel like I've just hit a plateau and I'm not sure how to push through it. 

Some people on here argue for practicing builds solo in playgrounds/creative but I'm not really sure what builds to even practice besides double-ramp-wall's, 90's, etc. Pubs is good for practicing against actual players but if I'm trying to practice building it doesn't seem like an efficient way to improve. I work around 45 hours a week and am an amateur boxer as well so I only really have about 2-3 hours to play Monday-Friday but am free on the weekends. Should I try to find a good player to 1v1 against? I just am kind of lost on where to go from here.

How do you guys improve?

Advice on how to get proper practice/tips?","I feel like I'm a decent player in most aspects of the game ([stats](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/ryanjt761) for reference), however I'm absolutely rubbish at building, so bad that I'm sure 90+% of this sub could beat me in a playground build fight haha. It's been really frustrating knowing how much I could improve just by getting good at this vital game mechanic. The past few seasons I've been really struggling in solos (by my standards, solo stats have dropped almost 10% in all areas since S4) compared to how I used to play, but actually did surprisingly well in the Siphon mode yesterday, which made me realise what my main flaw was (apart from dying off spawn with 0-1 kills half my games nowadays mainly because of bad rng lol), even when I'm playing really well: I have the gun skill, game sense etc to win most fair fights, but because of my shit builds I almost always take decent damage during a fight, which accumulates during a match and I usually end up dying due to not having enough health/shield etc, especially vs decent players. My strategy against a good builder has been to low-ground warrior and hope they get impatient/think I'm a bot and jump down, however when someone doesn't take the bait I'm kinda stumped lmao. (I did well in the Siphon mode because I wasn't really punished for losing a chunk of health because I could just get it back right away).  

As far as my building goes, I can single ramp-wall-floor and build kinda fast 1x1's/90s (until I harry-potter myself), and that's about it lol. I'm hopeless in build fights and even against average players now I get consistently out built. I've done some practice in the past week or so in playground, and by myself in a no-stress environment I can do decently fast 90's, edits, etc., however under some pressure in an actual match against a decent builder, I just get completely lost when I lose high ground and usually resort to being a low ground warrior, or when I actually have high ground it I usually end up harry-pottering myself eventually. 

I know the best solution is to practice against decent builders, but among people I know, they are either not good enough for me to improve, or way too good and they just dunk on me without me really learning anything. Is there any community, or anyone out there who I can practice against and give me advice(and not just flex their building skills and insta-wrecking me haha).

You will need: a notebook, or a device to type things


IF YOU ARE PLAYING

Whenever you die, go back to replays and see how YOU died, and how THEY got the kill. There are almost always 2 things you can note down after each death, I guess you can't do anything if you lag, or a plane rams you, etc

In terms of how you die, it usually comes down to: bad building or bad shooting. With these 2 aspects of the game, the only thing that I can recommend is to practice. There are also other aspects that cause you to die such as: not reloading guns, not using the right gun, not taking the opportunity to use a trap, etc. Note them down and try improve on these things, but be patient with it.

In terms of how they kills you, it's pretty simple. Spectate them and take notice of every single small thing that they did to get the kill on you. Did they reload all their guns before attacking? Did they place a good piece to block you off? Did they aim their crosshairs to anticipate you for an easy shot? Etc. Note these down and try add it to your gameplay where needed.

An example of what my list looks like:

- being too passive in a fight. I hand cannoned his stair so I could taken the high ground but instead tried to play to stay alive instead of die. Increase confidence to improve in this aspect.

- always getting trapped beneath the stair that I want to build because i press the stair bind too quickly. Practice 90s on uneven terrain to improve. 

--------------------------

IF YOU ARE AWAY FROM PC/CONSOLE

Watch good streamers play in the pop up cup. At the end of the day, these are some  the best players in the game since they are getting the most points right? Just like you did previously, right down everything the streamer is doing correctly to get him that kill or that survival, or that high ground.

Example:

- if someone is turtling, shoot a deagle at any wall and immediately replace it. Try and choose a wall you know the enemy isn't looking at

Well guess what morons, Battle Royale is RNG in nature.  Epic could scrub the RNG out of the game for months and months on end, but they won't do it. Why?

1. Because it's what made Fortnite popular to begin with.

2. Because it would be a completely different game.

Epic can't listen to competitive players because, by in large, they're one note.  You can predict what they'll think about a new mechanic based on whether or not it's RNG.

What features do you think we should be able to turn on/off and what features do you think should be left alone? THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH SKINS OR COSMETICS BTW. 

I’ll start off a suggestion and I think fortnite should add in a customizable FOV (field of view). This is the main reason why people stretch their resolution and if we could do it in game it wouldn’t look like such garbage. One game where a customizable FOV helped me was rocket league. Having the camera further away from your character allows you to gain a much better perspective of yourself and your enemies.

&amp;nbsp;

and it seems they keep changing how the game renders viewdistance or maybe its the map changes and new POIs added, anyway especially in crowded areas or where viewdistance is far it can drop my fps a lot and just wondering if there is some things I can test that anyone could recommend to improve performance a lot on lower end CPUs ? gonna have to upgrade CPU and ram soon enough but until then just checking if anyone have some good tips to squeeze out some extra fps or so from this setup;

any tips like trying some custom lower/stretched resolutions or something? should I update windows10 to newer versions with that game mode stuff? (currently using 1607) i'm on EAC right now should I see if I can go to BattleEye instead or is that pointless? try older nvidia drivers? (currently on 416.94) any tips at all would be greatly appreciated anyway, I guess only thing that will help for sure is upgrading cpu and ram but until then atleast would be nice to improve performance somewhat, atleast since the game used to run WAY better and smoother on the same hardware, and now even on a fresh install its a lot worse than before :S cheers !

What are your suggestions on nerfing the plane? ",FortniteCompetitive

(Repost from another forum),"Copied:  unlike most games that has big latency difference between server locations , right now all we can choose is the **region** we want to play in (EU , NA etc) so it can **automatically** put us in a random server inside that specific region.  


to me this is just frustrating. sometimes i can get a game with 40-50ping because im connected to DE FRANKFURT which is the closest , best server for me , other times i can get a 100ping game because the game decided i should be connected to Paris.  


the difference is HUGE , it just looks kind of lame to me that we have no control over these things that can really ruin our experience with the game.  


i just hope epic are going to see this. i thought at some point this will be added but it doesnt seem like they understand this is an issue. 

My Own words now : I live in Dubai, and the Asian servers vary from 70-180 ping, which IMO is very annoying and the high ping kills me quite a lot sometimes, I would personally want a max ping limit that can be set by us, so that we don't get ping higher than what we want .",FortniteCompetitive

148,harrymaclary,1545408369,a8begn,71,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a8begn/the_misconception_about_the_fastest_90s/,1,The misconception about the 'fastest 90s',"Ive noticed alot of people have been saying that the fastest way to do 90s is to do mitro 90s or the anticlockwise variaton. The actual 'fastest 90' can pretty much be done with any variation, you just need to make sure you have maximum momentum (basically not hitting your outer wall) and that you have  well timed jumps so that you are at the uppermost part of the ramp (without harry poterring) and that you jump the instant you land for each level you go up. Some 90s variations may help with this. Such as using directional movement but their all technically the same speed because you're capped by your characthers movement speed. Beaks has pointed it out but people still seem to think that a certain variation is fastest. 

In conclusion, dont listen to alot of those tutorials out there that tell you which variation is the best. focus on the variation you are most comfortable with and work on keeping momenum and perfecting the timing of your jumps. (Also on not harry pottering yourself.)

One of the issues they have to solve is the queue times at the higher ranks.

I think it will be impossible to let all top/pro players play against eachother all the time, especially during the night or morning on a weekday. There is just not enough people queuing up. But since some form of ranked system is better than none at all, I propose the following League based system.

- Each player is in a league and only plays within his league.
- A league is a large group of players of similar skill level.
- The League system is cross platform
- Regions like EU and NA get more diverse leagues because the population is bigger.
- Because of the previous point you only obtain rank in the region you play in.
- The top League allows exactly 50.000 players per region. Maybe the number can be smaller but queue times should not be longer than 5 minutes.
- You gain points based on elims and placement. Similar system to what has been used before.
- There is a small penalty for hot dropping.  Dieing out of the top 50 without a kill while first circle hasnt closed yet.
- Having high average points per match over a longer period is a way to trigger promotion.
- If you average less than half a point per match over a longer period you are outclassed in your current league and could get demoted.
- In the top league demotion is also triggered when another player enters the league and you are last on the list.
- Big bonus is a way to trigger fast promotions for players that are clearly outclassing their league.

Farming takes so long and kills are not rewarded! Even scrims on the normal mode are far less fun than the cups, not to mention you need to wait 20 mins for the next game if you die. I think this game NEEDS some sort of 24/7 ranked mode with different settings than the regular playlists or just pop up cups on all day, e.g   
6:00 - 11:00: Duo Cup.   
11:00 - 16:00: Solo Cup.   
16:00 - 21:00: Duo Cup.   
21:00 - 2:00: Solo Cup.  
etc.

And they could maybe just add the cup settings to regular modes too. Thoughts?

Now (with the delayed first piece placement) it almost feels like the option was never implemented in the first place with how long it takes to place a build in a fast paced fight. It’s so annoying when you’re trying to make space between you and a player who’s “w keying” you with a P90 and the game isn’t sure if you want to put a wall down or not.

The issue now, imo, is that there's 2 groups of players in the pop up cup:

1. Playing for placement

2. Trying to slay out tilted/hot drop. 

This makes for really imbalanced game play. Most games only have 28-30 players remaining by second circle. I think at this point, there's a good amount of natural incentive for players to attack each other. Epic should try removing the artificial reward completely. This would make late game much more authentic and realistic to what actual tournament play has been like. The cap to the number of games hasn't really helped with that in my opinion.

First, As many people have already mentioned, we need custom edit speed. Currently, my edit speed is the same as my regular sensitivity not my build sensitivity (makes edits super clunky if you to have lower aim sens and relatively high build sense like me). I miss edits all the time in the heat of the battle due to this.

Secondly, id like one of two options. Id like to either be able to turn off “edit to confirm” or make the select button (right trigger for most) double as a confirm button if you press it again immediately after selecting your edit. On console without an elite controller your limited in what buttons to use for edits. When trying to build/edit quickly its very tricky to press three buttons quickly to complete an edit. If they go the first route i understand there are a few edits you cant complete, but if definitely make that sacrifice to be able to more quickly shotgun into a box/ramp with cover, etc, and you dont have to use this option. with the second option, pressing the right trigger once after selecting is much easier to pull of consistently and keeps both thumbs on the sticks instead of having to press a third key

Currently edit plays arent nearly as big on console as they are on pc, and i think its mostly due to the lacking customization and options for us. Hope this gets changed!",FortniteCompetitive

Not only would sticking a clinger to a plane be satisfying as hell, but it would deter pilots from flying to close to players that could potentially clinger their plane and cause not only damage to the plane, but also themselves.

I can't sem to find any real reason on why Clingers were vaulted in the first place, I guess to make room for Dynamite, but they definitely seem like they would shine in this current meta with planes and scrim building.

As an actual bad player who actually knows what it is like I can assure you that I really don't enjoy many of these changes. For example:

* The spray meta was particularly boring for me, as I simply didn't have the ability to use shotguns and building to counter it so every fight became a complete spray off.
* Planes make the game messy and you would be surprised how many decent players with aks will make you regret using them.
* Health on kill is great and allows you to deal with 3rd parties better when you do occasionally win a fight; most of us care about this more than trying to 3rd party a guy who is actually on 100/100 health.

If Fortnite really want to cater to us their best bet is some kind of ranked queue so bots can end up against each other.",FortniteCompetitive

Quite literally the only thing I would change about the vaulted mode is... get rid of or nerf RPGs.  You do that... and that game is just about damn near perfect save maybe adding the shield for kills merchanic.

After the first fight he is taken down to 70 health before getting the kill to regen to 120HP. He is then immediately met by two players pushing him from either side of the box.

He gets taken down to 52 health before he finds the kill on one of the players and regens to 102 (Takes one tic of a stink too). At this stage in a normal pub he would have been dead with 1 kill despite playing the situation well.

he then repositions himself and finds the easy pump through his opponents edited wall. He now has enough health to be confident to take on another third party that comes to push him, and easily gets the kill.

I think this clip perfectly shows why regen for kills is good for the game. Each fight he had was a fair fight, in which the player with the better aim won. ",FortniteCompetitive

I’m not saying this in relation to combat as any decent player can block a grappler user, but more in relation to late game rotations. Having a grappler in the final 3 zones is a huuuggge advantage and makes rotations 1000% easier and takes essentially no skill.

Replacing the grappler with impulses would be good imo as impulses are more common and hence less RNG is involved in finding them. They are also harder to use than grapplers and can result in self damage if used incorrectly ( I know this can be said about grapplers as well but you have to seriously fuck up to take fall damage with a grappler).

Help appreciated","I saw another post by someone who had played over 2000 matches and got 5 wins. He asked how to get better. I played over 1200 times and haven't won a single game.

My problem is that I always get pretty high kill streaks with decent skill (about 8-12 a game), but I always end up losing because I made some lousy mistake. For instance, the first 20 minutes or so I'd get 8 kills with a couple of great snipes, and then I'd lose a fight with 200 HP and 999 wood because I couldn't land a single shot on someone with low HP.

You'd say this happens to all of us and I should just analyse these mistakes and then try to fix them (which is what I'm doing), but you'd think that for sure you would have at least one win after 1200 matches, right? Things like this happens every game and I just feel like I'm cursed with bad luck.

I have noticed my hands sweat a lot during build fights or other tense moments. This really destroys my performance. I also seem to choke a lot (literally, like my throat gets dry and then I choke) when I'm 1v1'ing someone.

And Epic answered yall's call for help and did both within a relatively decent time span. While I have been very opposed to some of the decisions that Epic makes, i am a huge supporter of Fortnite and Epic Games. This game brings a sense of competitiveness and fun that many multiplayer games haven't brought in years.

 In my opinion, at this very moment, this is the most balanced the game has been in many seasons. People are creating posts about how the planes are still unbalanced, that the loot is unfair so the game cant be competitive, the servers aren't great. 

Well I'm sorry to burst your bubble but planes are great for rotating and getting a couple hits on an enemy but they get destroyed extremely fast with any type of aggressive play. Irritating yes, but unbalanced, no. 

Loot is a part of battle royale. You cant always get a gold pump out of a chest. Sometimes you have to make it work with a common burst. At the end of the day, land somewhere else, change your play style based on the weapon you have, and sometimes just take your loss and move on. Fortnite is not all building and shooting, the mental aspect and strategy is huge. 

Your dying because your ping is on 80? Great excuse pal. People on West Coast play on East Coast servers all the time. People in EU play on NA servers. Thousands and thousands of players play on mixed pings all the time. Play with a lag constantly, play with a delay that others dont have all the time. It is not the reason you died. Did it help you? Obviously not, but it isnt the reason you died.   


All in all, stop blaming the game for every reason your not winning or dying.

Many people have suggested a fuel system, and I think the devs are hesitant to put a system like that in due to how it fits into the style of the game. No other vehicle has the system and it seems out of place, in my opinion.

So to prevent camping in final circles the storm could like strike the plane even if its in zone, chipping away at the plane hp or even some player hp as well. Im no balance expert so I’m unsure what damage values would fit. Turbulence would come in as a warning before a lightning strike so the player becomes aware that it is about to happen. It could just be like a screen shake and short loss of control on the plane.

I feel like a system like this could be good to prevent plane camping in the final zones and would be a change that would fit the style of fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

Prove me wrong,When I watch the top Fortnite streamers play a lot of them don't use SMGs at all. Usually just an AR and a Shotgun then the rest of their slots are filled with utility. So are SMGs even worth? They hit really low most of the time and usually I only use it at the very end of someone's life just to finish them off. The extra utility slot you get out of not having an SMG could be beneficial. I always run into situations where I find a very useful item and I am stuck choosing to drop one of my other utility items for it. Why even choose? Just don't use an SMG. It barely does damage anyway. You can always switch to your AR. Or just pump again. Idk what do you guys think?,FortniteCompetitive

Introducing Ranked Solos, a fully fledged ELO matchmaking system! Progress through the tiers, work your way up the leaderboards, and make a name for yourself in the competitive community.

**How do I start?**

You can start your ranked grind right now during our preseason. All you need to do is link your Fortnite account and queue up for a ranked solo match (any region). Our match tracking technology will handle updating your ELO based on your match performance. After 10 placement matches you'll be given a rank based on your current ELO. Matches need at least FIVE linked players in order to be tracked. The higher you climb through the ranks, the more matchmaking channels you unlock.

**Queue Limitations**

To keep everyone in the same skill group during matchmaking, your tier will determine what queues you’re allowed to participate in. We have the tiers: Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Master. With the divisions I, II, and III for each up tier up to Master. Players are able to queue up for their tier, or up to two tiers under it.

**Placement Rank**

Every season you will start off without a rank. Your first 10 matches will determine your placement rank. This is based on how you placed in the match and how many players you killed. Each season every player will undergo a soft reset so your rank may possibly be lower than what you had at the end of the previous season.

**Demotions**

Dropping below the ELO threshold for your rank will result in a demotion. Once you are demoted, you will no longer be able to play in that matchmaking queue. You are allowed to drop 25 ELO below your current ranks ELO requirement before you are demoted so you aren’t constantly swapping between ranks.

**Rank Decay**

Platinum, Diamond and Master are all subject to ELO decay. After 14 days of inactivity you will begin to lose ELO based on your current tier. Platinum players will lose 10 ELO a day, Diamond players will lose 20, and Master players will lose 40. Decay is in place to make sure players are actively playing and keeping our matchmaking system accurate.

**How's Team Liquid involved?**

You will definitely want to stay tuned for next week. We have a big announcement in store that we’ve been planning with Team Liquid. However, they have officially became a partner with FNPL and we look forward working with them to further the competitive Fortnite scene.

Lastly, our website has been updated with new ELO leaderboards, along with detailed match statistics on each player’s profile. You may login to see your stats, or use the command !stats on our Discord which will generate a pretty image for you.

Planes, to me they weren't a issue very much minus build battles and getting boosted through. IMO it was a little OP. Not nearly as much as over 90% of this thread has made it seem. During pubs I mostly play squads a lil but of duos. Solos rarely and only when im at work on my phone. But back to planes, since I mostly play with other people we spam almost every plane that has come across us just for the fact that they domt have a advantage on us late in game or just because we want the fight. Low ammo or not we spray them down about 98% of the time. The cons are obviously running out of AR ammo. The pros are tremendous compared though. The chance they decide to fight you which equals more loot and ammo. The firing which bringa a 3rd party which is one of my favorite parts of the game. Which still equals more loot(only time i was getting annoyed at 3rd partys was during redeploy. 

Even when fighting another squad and a plane came rushing in i would just drop to low ground wait a little bit to collect myself then push in to begin the fight. There such a great rotating tool amd i like the updates epic keeps putting into it because although it isnt a problem to me it makes the QOL better for everyone.

Shotguns, nothing to say you should be able to one pump and i look forward to if epic decides to get rid of the timer and how they would do it. I do feel lile the heavy shotgun needs to have a little buff because a gold heavy vs a gold pump is a easy rip currently.

ARs, all of them in my opinion are pretty balanced. Don't know how I feel about the AK updates currently because i haven't used it yet but i dont underatand why it would need a buff.

Smgs, the new meta but only in pubs really. Get used to it because it will be meta for a very long time. Competitively pros pick up SMGs early game but once they have an extra med or deagle anything really they just switch to AR/Shotgun.

From a competitive standpoint such as the pop up cups and the winter royale. It showed that the planes need a fuel system. But until there is a competitive mode pubs shouldnt have it. Pop up cups are eh. But hopefully when comp comes out if ever it does. And ill say this and it will trigger people i believe that quadcrashers should have a limit to boosts. Everyone always talks about how late game there is too many people(this is focused primarily to pro games) am easy way to counter would be to cut in half planes and quads so people cant rotate easily and will be forced to fight in some situations. 

Ziplines, just no imo theyre alright to use but they iust clutter the map too much and force me to change my playatyle around them which i dont like at all. No game sjould have a mechanic that will make your playstyle change drastically. *cough sword cough*

The updates and additions and takeaaays they do to the game are good imo. Keeps the game fresh for casuals which is how to build longevity. I do wish they did a optimization/QOL/bug fix update every 4-6 weeks. Or at least a small bug update a few days after each. 

I love this game and will continue to love this game. I play games for competitive reasons. I like to win. And I like to win against good players. 

I come from E-Sports made my living as a media director in Las Vegas for almost every local LAN for csgo and a few ow events. MOBAs arent really my thing. Im in the army now so my career path is driven away from gaming currently but i still habe a passion for it. 

If you have any questions or wish to discuss my thoughts on anything I would be glad to.

Oh and remember games and companies jave different teams for different parts of the game so dont blame epic entirely. They should have better communication but with how busy I believe and know they are. They dont always have the time to.

Remember to adapt to your surroundings. 
Something I learned in the army. You cant control everything so be prepared for anything.
 And dont lie to yourself you know the game feels real good as of late.

Recently I’ve found it harder and harder to win games. The average player is so much better now than they were a few months ago. 

One of EPIC’s big things is bringing in and keeping new players. The way the game and player base is now, I don’t see how any new players can enjoy the game. They have close to 0 chance of winning a game, and they are likely going to get outplayed during most engagements. 

With Ranked Play, most good players will be taken out of the Casual lobby’s, giving new and less skilled players better shots at winning and enjoying the game. 

I haven’t really seen the case for non-competitive players argued here, only the case for competitive players. What do you guys think? ",FortniteCompetitive

The Pop-Up Cups have completely changed that. I have grown as a player substantially more through the last few solo Pop-Ups than at any other point in my Fortnite career. I've been playing since Season 1, and honestly my mechanics/strategy would not have changed if it wasn't for me making it to the final zone in a 15+ point lobby. It really is amazing how drastic the gameplay difference is once you get past \~12 points. It's a whole new ball game.

&amp;#x200B;

The Pop-Up Cups force you to adapt to the play style of better players, and if you don't adapt/get better you'll never reach the 20+ point lobbies. My first Cup I got to 8 points and was happy. I've gradually gotten more and more points, and last night managed to get 20 points through 10 games, including a 8 point victory royale (which was the most satisfying BR victory of my life... including my first ever H1Z1 win years ago).

&amp;#x200B;

For all the shit Epic has done, this is a bright spot. Thank you for giving all players a platform to compare their play styles with others who are better than them, and giving all players a chance to improve/grind in a competitive atmosphere.

Ghost peeking was broken, but the camera angle when peeking now is broken. It was a premature fix.

If you do not know what I am talking about, I am referring to the camera angle when you are in a 1x1 for example. The camera will make it look like your head is safe when it is really not, etc. This is an issue in other situations as well, and if you have not ever noticed (I bet you have), go in PG and try it. Your head is exposed when it does not appear exposed due to the terrible camera angle.

I realize the issue is more complex than it appears. But, I would rather have ghost peeking back than this terrible camera angle. I hope Epic is working on a fix for this, and the community should not just drop this issue.

P.S. fix brick ramps while you are at it. ",FortniteCompetitive

Kaysid** was a good signing by TSM but I do think Cowboy was a bad signing for the team but none the less there were in the right direction. Then two months later on December 11, **ZexRow** joined. ZexRow is arguably the best Fortnite players out there he has one of the best aims in the game a really great signing for TSM...... so let talks what they should do next... as of now, TSM has ZexRow and Kaysid so they need two more pros to finishes the pro squad. I think these two players will most likely happen 

&amp;#x200B;

\#1 Symfuhny - To me, I can't think of a place symfuhny would sign too. Liquid doesn't need him, Faze I don't think he to be in Tfues shadow, and he would be one of 14 pros on ghost if he signed there. TSM would be a great org he could grow his brand and play competitively with Zex and Kaysid 

 

\#2 Vinny1x - pretty simple he's ZexRows teammate.

Here are rough notes on ways to mitigate keyboard noise:,"• cardioid mic - cardioid is a type of mic or mic setting that accepts sound primarily from one direction. Doesn't really matter if it's dynamic or condenser, but having a cardioid mic is crucial for rejecting sound coming from keyboard

• rubber O-Rings - for non-membrane switches, you could use one or even two 2mm 40A (soft) o-rings on every switch to reduce the sound of the keycaps striking the board

• lubrication - dielectric grease can be applied to the contact points around the keyboard switches and guide rails, like on the space bar / shift keys

• dampening - put keyboard on top of mousepad to limit keyboard sound vibrating through desk

• keyboard plastic - ABS plastic is softer and has lower pitch (less acoustically offensive) clicking noise than PBT plastic

• angle -  for mics suspended over desk by clamped boom arm, angle mic so the base of the mic points towards your keyboard, to obstruct sound coming from that direction

• noise gates are overrated. noise suppression filters are useful but not for keyboard noise

• keyboard switches - shorter actuation switches require less overall force to activate, allowing for softer, quieter strokes - like cherry mx silver (speed)

• shock absorber elastic cradle for mic - to stop keyboard sound waves traveling through desk along boom arm to mic

• gain - don't use any gain on mic or in audio filters, this amplifies keyboard clicking and unwanted sounds more noticeably than it amplifies your voice

• distance - put mic as physically far away from keyboard as possible

• position - mic should be as close to your mouth hole as you can tolerate, so your mic stream volume can be set lower, minimizing the amplification of ambient background noise

• acoustics - soft fabrics in your room will absorb sounds better. Hard walls behind or next to your desk will bounce the keyboard noises back towards your mic",FortniteCompetitive

In my opinion the only times a snipershot takes no skill is when someone is standing still, but I feel like if you stand still in the open for too long, you should get punished for it. 
But it's not that easy to hit someone when they are running, jumping and changing directions a lot, that's a skill you definitely have to learn. 
I personally think that the damage you get with a bolt is perfectly fine as it is, I don't think people would want to carry a sniper if it couldn't oneshot people anymore.
But I wouldn't be upset if they lower the damage from the heavy to let's say 140/147, because most of the times you are running around with 150hp, so this would give you a chance to survive after someone hit you in the body.
So I don't really know how to explain this in english, but another thing they could add is that the breathing of your character affects your accuracy when you're scoped in, like you have it in a lot of other shooter games, I think you know what I mean with that. But I don't know if this would be a good idea in this game, just saying that this could be an option.

So how do you guys feel about sniping in this game?",FortniteCompetitive

I've gotten crazy good at edits, build battles, and especially flick shots. My strong point is fast reflexes. A Possible quality I lack is build battle tactics like planing and roof tricks and whatever, I just neglect practicing them because I think its extra as hell. Skill Placement wise in at the advanced level, the average high. I'm barely at the neck of professionals and streamers. And it's not too difficult to tell a pro player, even without a yt or ttv, it's always gonna be some cool sounding name that's not an actual word like, Pythr, or Zyloh, or Vartrix lmao (mine is too but I ain't a pro) . My main issue is I'm not getting solo dubs as consistently as I feel. I try to aim for 2-4 solo dubs at the least daily, I know it's not much. I always pull high kill games though. It's just that in the end I lose the game to the often one crazy good player better than me aforementioned above. I usually land at mediocerly populated spots like Lazy, or Lucky Landing, and I've tried landing at Tilted, and I pull some good kills but in the end get my ass handed to me after five, I just dont see why people would want to land at a place with an astoundingly high player concentration and little resources, if they want to win a game. My Gtag on xbox one is Move Zemos. My solo dub count is 39 and yeah that really sucks but it doesnt represent my skill I'm just unfortunate with wins. Is there anyway I can improve or have I hit a plateau? How can I match the energy and skill of these professionals.

After 2 seasons of thinking about it, slowly changing it and perfecting it in my head, Im pretty certain that I’ve came up with the perfect solution to have double shotgun in the game and not have it completely annihilate.

Pump-smg isn’t a playstyle that everyone loves. It’s too bloomy(unless you have godlike aim+luck).

Pump-deagle is another playstyle, but again, it has bloom. Those shots that you absolutely need to hit have a chance to miss, even if you have perfect aim(unless you barrel stuff, but that’s not in every fight).

The main reason why double shotgun was loved by the ones who used it was because if you had aim, you were gonna hit them. Most say when you hit them it was too much, and I’d agree. At the end of season 4, it was close to being balanced, but it still reigned supreme as the most used(and most powerful)loadout.

Honestly I hate using pump-smg, I’ve grown to have a hatred for smgs. It just wasn’t the right time for them to add and buff them. I was so used to and loved double shotgun with all my heart, and smgs came out of nowhere and completely destroyed everything. Right as they removed my favorite playstyle. It just wasn’t the right time.

Now, to get to the balancing. This can allow for shotgun-smg users to still beat shotgun-shotgun users, and the same way around, depending how good you were with it. How I see balance is this:

If you have two shotguns next to each other in your inventory, they automatically change stats. This defeats the argument “what if I want to carry a shotgun to my friend?”, since you can just put the shotgun in a different slot. If the shotgun is in a different slot, then the stats stay the same as they are now.

Once you put the shotguns together, these are the changes:

Pump base: 80/85

-(The purple and legendary pumps can’t double so it’s more balanced. They would be able to hit for 150[\/], and that would be op.)

All shotgun headshot multipliers: 1.5

-this leaves a max damage of 130 for pumps, 111 for tacs, and 116 for heavies. This can be revised and tweaked to be more balanced.

And how the circle delay would work:

Pump-pump: 0.9
Pump-tac: 0.7
Pump-heavy: 0.9
Heavy-heavy: 1.0(don’t want that back lol)
Heavy-tac: 0.7
Tac-tac: 1.0(just don’t use it)

And the same in reverse.

This will get rid of the ping issue where people with extremely low ping could shoot way too fast. This is solved since there is a cap at the fire rate.

This will also allow for other playstyles. Wanna shoot fast, do a little less damage than pump-pump/heavy, and be a little less aim-based? Do pump-tac. Wanna shoot slower, get used to the constant switching of shotguns, get rewarded for high aim, and deal a little more damage than pump-tac? Use pump-pump/heavy.

Also remove the circle delay from solo shotgunning. It’s pointless and kinda ruins it in certain situations. No, this won’t bring back an op double pump, since the guns automatically wait until the right time to shoot again if you switch weapons and switch back quickly(try it with deagles). This will just help tacs and heavies since the circle timer is based off of the pump fire rate, and they shoot faster than that.

Personally I strongly believe that this won’t be overpowered. People who use shotgun-smg will get that 95/100(105/110 for purple and legendary pumps)body shot and 2.0 headshot multiplier, so they will have the advantage there.

Maybe they could test this in a pop-up cup to see if it fits well and maybe tweak it a little so double shotgun can be the most balanced. I really think this could work and make Fortnite really good again. I know a lot of people who hate the game because of the removal of double shotgun(including me), and this will definitely make them more interested in the game(and I think this goes for those people too, but I would buy a lot more stuff in the game lol).",FortniteCompetitive

I'm sure most of you probably breezed by this portion of the tournament, but for a filthy casual like myself, I'm trying to slowly but surely improve on my mechanics and figured I'd turn to the best.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that there's no set sensitivity that works for everyone, and that it's a balance of speed and accuracy - I'm more interested in what training system you used, and how fast you increased sensitivities, in your earlier days of playing.

&amp;#x200B;

A few questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1) I've been skating by on 5/5 for as long as I've been playing because moving-shotgun accuracy is my weakest area, but I just don't think it's viable anymore.  If you were to increase your sensitivities to find your comfort zone, would you make small increments by .5, or would you jump right to a 7/7 and just force yourself to adjust?

&amp;#x200B;

2) Is your ADS/Scope higher than your general sensitivity, or vice versa?  Is it a matter of preference, or should one always be higher than the other?

&amp;#x200B;

3) What warm-up or training system do you use to improve your close-range jump shots and flicks, if any?  The targets in Playground are great for ADS, but there's nothing really to practice run-and-gun.  The dummy mini-games up top glitch for me now and send me below the map, and jumping around a llama doesn't simulate my target moving around.

Hey Guys,

Convertible from GenG esports. I do lots of VOD Reviews and Free Coaching work to advance the Competitive Community in North America, Europe, and the Oceanic Region on Reddit and my stream!

I started off as an Overwatch player, but I stopped playing it since I suffered a hand injury. My most notable team as a player was the Overwatch League Midseason Pickups. I then moved into a position on SAMSUNG's Fortnite team as the Lead Analyst and Assistant Coach. 

After we mutually parted ways, I decided that I wanted to fully dive into Fortnite and I posted LFT on Twitter. After many trials with a lot of organizations, I signed with GenG, and I feel that GenG and I are a perfect match for each other. 

GenG is completely committed to setting the Gold Standard in esports and that shows in their super high-tech facility in Korea, and the fact that they allow me to work with everyone to better the competitive standard of Fortnite. &lt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAIVRR4Ss0U&gt;

#KovaaK

I'm KovaaK, probably best known in the Fortnite community for [my aim trainer on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/824270). I started programming when I was 12 by messing around with Quake 1's game source code and later got my B.S. in Computer Engineering. Professionally, I was a Nuclear Engineer for the last 9.5 years, but I'm between jobs right now and living off of the sales of the game with a plan to start my new job in early January.

My pro gaming connections are all in the Quake and Overwatch community, so I honestly didn't expect Fortnite players to pick it up. I played Quake 1 competitively from ~2001-2008 winning 1on1 tournaments and led my team to win 4on4 tournaments. I've always had a passion for teaching people when they are interested in the material at hand. When I was active in Quake and Reflex (indie game that is very Quake-like), I started up clans to teach people how to get better, made tutorials explaining in-depth mechanics/strategy, and did a ton of demo/replay reviews.

His shotgun (double pump) abilities were literally unmatched, and I watched him win countless games without picking up another gun besides 2 or 3 pumps. Ever since then, I've watched his streams and pretty quickly he became not only my favorite streamer but also favorite player to watch.

&amp;#x200B;

As I continued to play, the months went on and several game changing nerfs to the game were implemented. Around the same time I started reading reddit and  I saw a ton of people bashing Daequan all the time about his lack of scrimming and how he ""doesn't take competitive fortnite seriously"", ""should be kicked of TSM"", blah blah blah blah, and although it is sooooo over talked about, I genuinely wonder if anyone has ever thought of Daequan through his perspective...

&amp;#x200B;

For those who don't know, Dakotaz discovered Dae after randomly being partnered with him in a squad or duo match early on in fortnite. After playing together, Dakotaz invited him into the pro scrim scene, before it was really even a known thing to the common fortnite community, and I forget the specifics, but Dae went on to win like 80% or so of the solo pro scrim matches. Absolutely dominated, and thus got him signed by TSM.

&amp;#x200B;

He was so dominant, that epic thought his strategy was flawed and not only buffed shotguns, but completed vaulted double pump and changed the landscape of fortnite completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now thinking of the game through Daequan's shoes, can you imagine literally being one of the best at a game, spending countless hours practicing and mastering a certain technique.. just to have it completely vanished and the game's meta change completely, THEN epic announces the summer skirmish to win tons of money???? How would you keep the will to train hard? Not to mention, the scrim / competitive landscape (although it has come a long way) was the most boring thing ever when it first came to be. I turned the first Summer Skirmish off after 2 games because it was absolutely awful to watch. I just don't think people realize how disheartening this would be to any competitor and the hate Daequan gets for it is unfair. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope with pumps being back to a logical state, Dae may fall back in love and try to prove himself as one of the best, but can anyone reallllllly blame him for his lack of competitive intrigue? would love to hear opinions..",FortniteCompetitive

Another change I would like is for planes to be removed and every player to spawn with some bouncers in their inventory. 

And last but not least is to lessen the Splode ammo cap. This is essential since the mat cap was lowered.

- Increase the damage dealt to player onboard to 50 if the plane is destroyed.
- Reduce the health of the plane so people will happily shoot them down without burning through all their ammo
- Remove the turret on the plane

**How to Submit:** 

Visit the link provided above or [here](https://goo.gl/forms/SJmLPbbr8MWdqE9k2), select the region you participated in, and when it comes to the in-game screenshots you will be able to link 2 screenshots/pictures of your results from the tournament. **The most important one to link and remember to take, is a screenshot of the end of your final game showing your username and amount of points.** Example: https://i.imgur.com/BPfRvhs.jpg - The other screenshot/picture you need is of the final results showed in the events tab. Example: https://i.imgur.com/iKb8elU.jpg note: it is okay for these two pictures to be taken from a phone/camera if screenshotting is not available as long as you can see the necessary information in them. 

**Incentives:** 
The top 10 players from each region (NA, EU, OCE, ASIA, BR) will have their scores displayed within the results post with links to their socials. We will also be testing out how this works in order for us to be able to grant text flairs for users to show case their pins on next to their Reddit usernames!

466,Nouphal,1545041033,a6yj02,25,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a6yj02/one_month_pc_some_questions/,1,One Month PC. Some Questions!," 

I have switched to PC exactly a month a go. I wont go into details with my experience. I will just say this, if you have any disposable money save it for a PC (saved for my PC from July till 11/20/2018). getting 30fps console to 200-300 fps is like day and night. I have few questions for my sweaty PC bros!

* Should I cap my FPS? I have 144hz monitor. usually I get 200-300 FPS
* I tired different binds, sens and dpi. I have stuck with vivd binds (Q--&gt; wall, E--&gt; stairs, floor and roof on mouse) question is: \*\*can a certain bind inhibit you from doing a certain 90? for example I'm trying to learn Mongraal/ Mrsavage/ Martoz 90s. all three have almost similar style. I feel like their 90s are more protected compared to mine which I will link. it is difficult to hold only ""W"" while building with my binds. Do I just need more practice or my 90 is good? I can do my 90 with W key only
* there are too many options and too many resources to choose from, it will take time but for the short term are there things I should focus and to improve my Core game mechanics?
* Hot dropping tilted helped improve my aim tremendously. \*\*how do I practice for end game? or improve it\*\* I can get kills in titled but once i leave i get clapped almost all the time I have (3 wins, 74 top 10 placements, 215 top 25). wins is not as important I just want to be able to hang and stay alive as long as possible and win my 1v1s.
* \*\*does dpi and sens matter or is it just comfortably?\*\* almost all pros are from 400-800. my DPI was 4500 before; its 2000 rn. I tried from 400-4500. 2000 feels good atm.
* I'm playing stretched 1444, all settings low except textures on epic, and view distance on epic. \*\*How do keep settings saved after changing it?\*\* I""d like to make view distance medium but after I restart the game it goes back to epic
* \*\*how long till every things becomes natural?\*\* I put in 3-4 hours a day. I have seen someone mention 6 months.
* will I benefit from scrims at this moment time?
* W key all opponents like MrSavage or play the position game like Nickmercs?

&amp;#x200B;

My usual tactic is to just box up and if it kamikazes through my build, I hop in and get the easy one-pump. If it doesn't, I do my best to hit the pilot before he swings back around, or just try to shoot it down.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I've seen frequently on this sub is frustration on being in a build fight and having a plane third party. The solution is simple. DON'T BUILD TOO HIGH. You need to set a limit on how high you're building and CALL IT QUITS if someone builds over you. Play low ground and reset it. You are in for a world of hurt if you keep trying to play like it's Season 3. We all know how easy it is to ruin high altitude build fights in a plane so don't build high.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, if a plane IS third partying you, TIME YOUR FIGHTS. There's always around a 5-10 second gap between firing runs from a plane, you can use that to push your enemy or take shots on the plane/pilot. Prioritize whichever you think is the greater threat.

&amp;#x200B;

That's all I have. Thoughts? 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note (don't hurt me): \*I would love to see this community put forth more positive and constructive thoughts going into the future.\* Epic is constantly going to be making changes like this that cater towards its casual base. You have every right to complain, but I haven't seen a single post that talks about counters to planes, or the sword when it was in.

PLANES: There is not enough punishment for using the planes. Something that I see as a useful non rng rotation device can be easily abused both aggressively and passively.

* The people in the plane/the plane itself should take significant damage when ramming into buildings/terrain.
*  The plane itself should have a lower health and should deal 50 damage when blown up. 
* The planes need some sort of fuel system that prevents people from camping in.   

2. ZIPLINES: these need an activation key, which could simply be the interact button. Also they tend to be very buggy so hopefully that will be ironed out a bit.

3. BUGS/GLITCHES: Honestly I'm not super knowledgable on the technical aspects of this but I do know that they could put a bit more effort into the performance aspect of the game so it runs smoothly. I feel like the past two weeks have been one of the buggier times in Fortnite.

5. POPUP CUP FORMAT: Please make this into a permanent mode!

* Increase farm rate
* 50 health for eliminations
* Mats for eliminations
* 1500-2000ish mat count

5. ROSTER BLANCE/ITEM SPAWNING

* Vault the six shooter, dynamite, the quad launcher, and the turret 
* Make it to where you can't spam the grappler (ex: a reload animation)
* Rift to go has a longer start up time 
* Bring back bouncers
* Get rid of mats being in floor loot
* Increase shield spawn rate 
* Decrease the amount of ammo for explosives to be more in line with the lower mat count. 
* Decrease the explosive blast radius a bit or have it be on a scale. You shouldn't take the full damage just because you barely clipped the hitbox
* Decrease trap damage to 125
* Decrease heavy sniper body shot damage to 142 and 149 for the purple/gold
* Also, ideally I would like the whole rarity system to be toned down a bit. I think it's BS that a fight could be heavily influenced by the rarity of a weapon but I doubt this would happen. Just putting it out there though.

SHOTGUNS: I know this could be a bit controversial, but here me out on this. Right now I think that shotguns were buffed in the wrong way. The 100+ body shot damage is too high (especially early game) and I think shotguns should reward headshots more. 

* Lower body shot damage on green/blue pump to 90/95 
* Increase the green/blue pump headshot multiplier to 2.25 

This would mean that the green/blue pump could do a maximum damage of 203/214 respectively. The difference between a green and a blue pump would less significant as they would both have one shot potential. With these changes I would vault the purple/gold pump, as I think they would be unnecessary.

Tournaments are being played in the pop up cup settings and pros/players have little means of practice with the new settings. Epic needs to allow a 24/7 playlist with the pop up cup settings or change the normal playlist to have the same features as the pop up. I havent heard one person disagree with the pop up cup kill incentives so I'm not sure why there is such hesitation to implement these changes everywhere. ",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

So here's the issue:

At completely random times when playing, I'm experiencing issues where my character keeps moving a certain direction after I stop pressing the key. It's sort of like Auto-run activating on one of the WASD keys for no reason. For example, I would press 'W' and 'D' when doing a '90 or something, and after I take my finger off 'D' my character keeps moving right as if I'm still holding it down. It's extremely frustrating and as I know of now the only way to fix it is to either press the glitched key again once, or by pressing escape. It could also be a PC only issue because I've had other friends on PC mention it but nobody on controller has said anything about it.

Is there any possible solution or explanation anyone has for this? I'd love to receive feedback as at this point I've almost given up.

&amp;#x200B;

For more info I use a Logitech G Pro TKL keyboard and Logitech G502 mouse. I also am positive nothing is wrong with my keyboard because I use it regularly and this has never happened while typing or playing another game.

Epic obviously don’t want players playing on custom resolutions at lans/tournaments as it’ll make the game look “bad”, however I didn’t see this being a issue with CSGO tournaments where every player would play on their own custom res,  whilst production could stream the gameplay in native to make the game look good. Maybe this is could be something Epic could consider for future events and maybe get in contact with Valve on how they made it possible.

So my question is, how do you practice? Do you practice both or only ads? Cause if I'm used to flicking on a sensitivity 2x times lower than my hip fire sensitivity, my shotgun shots are gonna suck.

And what about muscle memory? If I practice aiming with my ads sens for 2 hours straight, my shotguns will suck and vise-versa. Thanks a lot guys!",FortniteCompetitive

The skill gap is completely garbage. Planes need adjustments, 800 health is too much, especially if youre doing solos or duos. If you destroy a plane and the player inside it is a complete bot, then it should deal 75 damage as a punishment.",FortniteCompetitive

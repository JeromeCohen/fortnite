Also my friend has $500 laptop that can run fortnite at 75 FPS. So now that is out of the way. I would like to say that if you can get a laptop that can run the game for the price required to efficiently use mouse and keyboard 
do you all still think that is fair to the people who can’t afford a xim4 and have to use controllers?


(Disclaimer this is just my personal opinion and I am just trying to make a point not point fingers at people who defend mouse and keyboard on console)

Also this post is directed at the game fortnite BR so please don’t bring up other games",FortNiteBR

Can we PLEASE stop bitching about console vs PC when it comes to tournaments, Summer Skirmish, etc.? It’s not that complicated. As a console player it’s annoying when such a big chunk of the community makes it seem like we play blindfolded with the controller behind our back. Yes there are bad players on console, there is 0 denying it, but there are bad players on PC as well. The limitations of playing with a controller and joysticks exist, and just because guys like NickMercs have gotten really good at it does not mean everyone that isn’t him is a bot. PC, in my opinion, is much more skillful and therefore the top level players are gonna be better than top level console players. But because of that i also think that the bad players on PC are very very very bad because it’s such a steep learning curve. I don’t get why it’s so hard to just appreciate a good player, whether they’re on PC, PS4, or Xbox, instead of just being toxic under pretty much every tweet about Fortnite from any account with more than 100 followers.",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;

We wanted to drop in with information regarding Friday's Summer Skirmish and the performance of the winner iDropz_Bodies in an effort of clarify some assumptions held by the community.

&amp;nbsp;

iDroPz_BoDiEs was unable to stream the event due to a Summer Skirmish rules requirement of a 2-minute stream delay for participants who wish to broadcast.  This delay cannot be set on the console capture software and is not possible for non-Affiliates on Twitch.  Following the event, he broadcasted replays of his Summer Skirmish matches.

&amp;nbsp;

Our rules do not stipulate that a participant must stream the event, as we do not wish to exclude players who were invited based on their own merit because they cannot stream - iDroPz_BoDiEs was invited to Summer Skirmish based off his performance in prior Showdown LTMs.

&amp;nbsp;

Now to address some concerns around that performance:

&amp;nbsp;

* Our internal Summer Skirmish analytics kept track of all opponents which participants eliminated.  iDroPz_BoDiEs had 129 eliminations during the event and every single elimination was on a different opponent.  This is not indicative of him having been intentionally fed eliminations and/or collusion with other players.

* Our analytics events also noted when players left the match prior to the bus deploying, and recorded those matches.  iDroPz_BoDiEs did not join more than the specified 10 matches for the event, the narrative that he was leaving if the server wasn't full or the bus wasn't on a favorable path is false.

* Stat tracking sites are unreliable for recording historic performance, as they only update when the website requests stats for a user from the API.  This makes any 'Most Eliminations in a Single Match' records on an account unlikely to be correct, as multiple matches in a time period are combined into one update.  iDroPz_BoDiEs has achieved more than 20 eliminations in a match multiple times across his Fortnite career.

* In previous Showdown LTM's which followed a similar scoring format on public servers, there has been no discernible difference in final score between top performers on PC and Console platforms. During this event we saw 11 matches break the 20 elimination mark, with 8 of them on PC and 3 on Console.

* There is no evidence that would suggest to us that iDroPz_BoDiEs played the competition using a mouse and keyboard.  Furthermore, we do not restrict input device for players on our platforms in an effort to promote accessibility for our entire audience.

&amp;nbsp;

We appreciate the community's concern around the integrity of the competition, but questioning the results of an individual participant without evidence unfairly tears apart at what should be a crowning moment of achievement for an individual who earned their way there and performed when it counted.

&amp;nbsp;

Our primary goal is to support competition that is fun, inclusive, and in line with the overall spirit of Fortnite.  Unsportsmanlike conduct from participants is not within that spirit, and will not be tolerated in Fortnite competition.  

**EDIT: To address additional comments, none of the accounts which were eliminated by iDroPz_BoDiEs were created between the time he was informed of his participation and the event itself.**",FortNiteBR

Epic, do not be foolish. This is burglary. There must be a FULL-ON investigation on his matches played.","IDropz_bodies is a PS4 player who won yesterday’s Saturday Skirmish. I was happy to see a fellow PS4 player did well, but unfortunately after seeing the evidence, it’s almost inevitable there was collusion and corruption in his win and road to winning $130,000.

**First, his stats:** 

iDropz_bodies had a 4 KD in Season 4. Before the tournament, he had a 4.5 in Season 5. It was elevated to 7+ after securing a 45 KD in Tournament matches. That is a 1000% increase as soon as the tournament started, and a quick drop back down to his normal self once the tournament was over. He dropped two 20+ kill wins in back to back matches, along with multiple matches between the 12-19 kill range. If you look at his past matches in Season 5, he has never done anything ever close to that.

**Suspect Replays:** 

After being accused of not being the one playing his matches (having his account recovered by someone else), he quickly shut down those rumors by streaming his replays on his Twitch channel. By doing this, he didn’t know the biggest suspicion of all was about to unfold. 

During the streaming of his replays. Viewers noticed there was countless players who did not shoot at him at all. Instead, these players just ran up to him and although moved around, didn’t really attempt to shoot him at all. There were even instances where players stayed in 1x1s and didn’t shoot at one another at all. Instead, both waited for iDrop_bodies to easily build up, and without even breaking a sweat, kill the player. This apparently happened multiple times.

When some viewers backtracked some names of the “easy” kills iDrop got. They found out something very worrying. These players accounts were brand new, and their first games just so happened to be during iDropz tournament matches. 

Viewers of the stream accounted for as high as 10 of these ultra no shooting back players during both of iDropz 20+ kill games.

But what was most suspicious about these players was what was in their inventory. When iDropz killed he,, they did not have any shield he was burning through when shooting. However, in their inventory, they had minis, half pots, med kits etc. 

For those who are not aware, it’s easier than you think to hop into someone’s match. The suspicious is that iDrop has played Queue up and give him free kills so he can place higher in the tournament. This is something that has happened before in the past, and still does happen in tourneys run by CMG/GB. It has happened in the past, and for a lot less money.

**Deleted “Suspended?” Twitch Account:**

Right after viewers switched their accusations from him not playing the matches to him having guys create new accounts and give him kills, something strange happened. People started sharing his Twitch because the proof was supposedly blatant and consistent through his matches. As people became increasingly aware, all of a sudden his Twitch channel was deleted, and with that, all the VODs of the blatant cheating. 

He claims that Twitch “suspended” his channel because of a profanity he used during one of his vods from when he use to play Destiny. Could be true, of course, yet very coincidental and beneficial that nobody can see those VODs anymore.

**Invited because of LTM win:** He was invited because he won an an LTM mode sometime back in the past. I believe it was the Showdown mode. This mode has been scrutinized, because many believed at that time that people cheated, and coincidentally, had friends join their lobbies and give them free kills.

**Epic:** Cause for Suspicion is true and undeniable. There is only one thing to do. There must be a full-on investigation into this players matches. I recommend looking at the replays and seeing if there really is an influx of players who did not shoot back. 

Also, I’d look at the IP address of players he routinely has played with before the tourney, and the IP of the players who looked like free kills in his tournament matches, and see if any of those IPs match up.

Of course it can be hard to prove corruption if you hide your footsteps. But there are mistakes and precautions that not everyone takes. When this much money is on the line, and there is this much cause for concern, due diligence and investigating is necessary on Epics part. It will preserve the integrity of future matches, and if there is no doubt that this player cheated, legal action should be apart of it. 

$130,000 is nothing to joke about. 

If nothing comes of it, I’m sure many of us will have our suspicious, but we will gladly take the fact that Epic looked into something that begged itself to be looked at. 

**TLDR:** Huge red flags with yesterday’s Saturday Skirmish and $130,000 take home winner. Investigation is necessary from Epic. If proven true, this player is robbing Epic and other competitors in the Tournament. ",FortNiteBR

- Note** If you wont read this. atleast please updoot this to let more people know about this. 

- My opinion: Epic should make a rule about streaming. 


- Reason number one, he was killing his friends all the time, DONT TELL ME that there is that many bots on Ps4. I was playing on Xbox (Imo xbox is even worse than Ps4) and there are NO bots. (EU Servers). Alright, maybe 1 or 2, per 100+ normal players, but unluckily, i didnt meet them. 
- He was skipping low-kill games to avoid lower score. Epic Games should know if it is true or not FOR SURE, but still, do you think that Fortnite tracker will generate 2 random low kill game records? Cmon
- From 6 K/D to 45 K/D. Many other famous streamers (Myths, HighDistortions) absolutely failed because of the pressure. And this kid somehow is X times under this pressure? How myth couldnt handle it and this no name kid actually yes? 
- Leaving early in games because of bad bus route. Yeah i know that Nick was doing the same thing but nah, please dont do it. It shouldnt be allowed. 
- Using keyboard against Console / Controller players. Shouldnt be allowed at all, not just because of the fact youre better, but because 99% Ps4 Players are just using controllers, because its NORMAL to use controller on CONSOLE
- Not streaming, we have to believe some random screenshots? I believe that some people are that good in photoshop, that they could photoshop some wins there. Or no? im not sure about this
- Suspended Twitch account because he said “Die N***r!”. Just this should get him DQed, if you cant controll your nervs on the stream you shouldnt pick up the prize.
- Twitch clips showing his bad skill with shotgun 1v1. Unfortunately we cant see them because his twitch account is suspended
- 20 Mins breaks between matches, more than enough time to team up with his friends on discord or to start a game and then delete it because it was a low kill game. I understand that its healthy to take some breaks after these try hard matches but still, fishy

Here-   


 Can't wait to get a lot of hate for this:  
I use mouse and keyboard on PS4 for many reasons and I beg of you just to put yourself into my shoes and have a positive mindset towards it, unlike anyone else who has listened to my argument.

Reasons:  
\-It's allowed

\-I can't afford a PC

\-I was honestly tired of using a controller and I wanted to try KBM for the first time when I saw it was supported in the game since Season 1.

\-Everyone has the ability to use it, it's not special to somebody that buys an adaptor.

\-You can use a controller on PC so why does it matter if KBM is used on console? Everyone chooses how they play, and this is the way I chose, with no earlier experience with KBM EVER except for typing.

\-It's fun for me to learn new ways of playing a video game like never before

\-Because I want to

Oh and by the way, if you don't like my argument or whatever, ask popular streamer, Avxry, about the topic. Tell him I sent you, he already knows who I am and what I do, (not trying to ""flex"" or anything, just trying to get you to understand) and he agrees with me already. In addition to this, controller has insanely OP aim assist and lets players of any skill hit basically every shot.

With a quick glance this weeks ""high score"" format looks pretty decent. Very similar to friday fornite, but instead of duos you solo and get points for kills and wins. Well if you look deeper into this it gets very weird because epic doesn't have a mandatory streaming rule. So in the case of i dropz bodies he didn't stream and could of easily cheated in multiple ways. He could of had friends que up at the same time and feed him kills and many many more. The format is clearly flawed and needs to be changed.

On game 1 20 Kills game.

iDropz_Bodies only received damage from his 4th kill and through the entire rest of the game he took no damage, meaning iDropz_Bodies fought against 16 enemies without taking a single damage from his enemies. Another fact is off the 14 players You can read the Name plates off EVERY SINGLE of those accounts are NEW accounts with 0 games played on season 4 or SEASON 5 stats. Due to this Subreddit rules I cannot link the player names but you can check it yourself on the replay.


On game 2 24 kILLS game.

iDropz_Bodies again was able to run the entire game and fight against 20 Enemies without receiving a single damage, in fact, only 3 enemies actually SHOT him back but completely missed their shots, the other enemies simply tried to build against him. This time, however, there were ""Fewer accounts without stats"" Again I was only able to get 14 Nameplates because he only turned it on after the first 10 kills. And off the 14 nameplates 10 of those nameplates were completely new accounts, with 0 stats or games played on season 4.


Please remember that iDropz could have gotten lucky and fought mostly new players, this is, in fact, a very RNG game. I check all of the players he fought against stats and most of them seems like new accounts, if there is a bug or problem on check stats from PS4 accounts I am not aware and can check my stats and who I fough against without a problem.

Through the other games, he shows his replay and through all fights iDropz take little to no damage, in fact, he only got close to dying 2x, 1 of them being fall damage.",FortNiteBR

For those that are not in the known a picture saying that renegade raider (season 1 season shop skin) is going to be back in the item shop. A lot of people are gojng mad saying that this is a 'OG' skin and it shouldnt be back. I have her and the halloween skins and dont see a problem with epic bringing them back if they allow us to refund them. On the patch notes of season 1 they said that Halloween skins would only be available until 11/4 and the seasom shop skins were unique to that season. I at that time just bought this skins because they were the best atm and because they were limited time and Im kinda addicted collecting things. I really dont see why there is so much hype around this skins when they are really mediocre compared to the skins we are getting (my opinion). I just think they should allow us to refund our skins because they were kinda sold around a fake advertisment. Thx for your time.,FortNiteBR

I feel like this is a slap on the face to the players who played since Season 1 and earned the skin the legit way.

I'm not an OG or anything (started right after Season 2 release), but I do think this is unfair to the ""OG"" players (Players who started before Season 2), as much as I want the skins to play as, I think Epic should leave the items as they are so they don't lose their value.

I'm starting to think Epic Games is getting greedy with their revenue and always wanting more, and that's fine I guess, but I think they should do something else instead of bringing back the old skins, as this will be removing the ""reputation"" and rarity of the skin. Instead, they should release more new exciting skins to get the old and new players to dig out their wallets, without causing anger and the feel of ""betrayal"".

The Holiday Items (Christmas, Halloween.etc), I guess I'm fine with as they WERE holiday items, but I think if they are going to be re-releasing it, maybe they should implement changes to the new one to differentiate from the old.",FortNiteBR

1. The new SMG devastates buildings so fast that you can essentially laser people right through their walls before they can repair or replace their structure

2. The explosives literally erase any structure you have

3. The rift jumping allows people to get easy positional advantages over you no matter how well you've secured a location and built.

The idea of ""just building"" is laughable now. The way to win games now is ""just hold down W and LMB"". Every time I get positional advantage on someone it's immediately taken away by just shooting down my ramps, blowing up everything I've built, or I win a build fight, kill the person, only to have someone dive bomb me from the sky with very little time for me to react.

I really really really hate what Fortnite turned into this season. I'm not having any fun at all. I feel like skillful building isn't rewarded anymore. I feel like I basically just get into fights where I lose because I can't ever manage to get shields and my opponent always has them, so even when we hit each other the same amount of times, I come up losing every battle because they just got luckier with loot.

It's extremely frustrating and after playing this mode since its release, I have to say this is quite possibly the worst season yet. I can never get or keep high ground on people anymore because building is pointless. As soon as I get high ground I lose it. As soon as I fight anyone I'm the one stuck on the ground because I'm not just spamming nonstop at them because I don't feel like that has ever been an effective strategy. Now it's just run right at them and nonstop shoot. I feel like all the skill has been removed from this game. Why bother trying to get better positioning on the enemy when you can just obliterate any structure they are on in a matter of seconds.

Explosives need a major nerf to how much building damage they do. The new SMG needs toned way down for building damage. The rifts need to be fewer and farther apart.",FortNiteBR

It isn't an engine issue tied to Unreal because other games running on Unreal Engine have perfectly good audio that can be heard from all directions accurately.

He’s just streamed his replays and it’s pretty obvious he’s using a controller.

1) When he open and closes his map for building you can see he always puts away then brings out the same weapon. This shows the use of a controller because there is no option to select specific weapons, unlike PC, where a good player would switch to the gun they thing is most useful for their current situation.

2) If you take some time to work out what guns he’s carrying and which ones are next to each other in his inventory slots, you can tell through the replays that he’s cycling through them in order to get to the item he wants to use. Once again, on PC you are able to select specific items so there is no need to cycle, and a good player dropping 30+ kill games would not be using the scroll wheel if he was using KBM.

Now, something that we can’t tell from the replays but I’m sure he did is pick his games very carefully, looking for certain bus routes across the map that would increase the number of players in a certain area for him to fight. This is likely why his time between games was so long, as he was joining and leaving games looking for good bus routes.

It is up to you as to if you classify this as cheating, but he completed all his games in the time period given by Epic so for me, that’s just clever matchmaking.

Congrats to IDropz_Bodies for his win and his incredible earnings.",FortNiteBR

Quite frankly, it’s silly to watch nick mercs beat someone like ninja in the summer skirmish. Nick mercs is a great console player, but it’s literally impossible for him to pull off some of the plays that ninja or cloak utilize.  PC and console play should be in different prize pools.

They are also from lots of different locations.

I am not sure how a guy went from a 5kd to dropping 20s etc but remember this guy also finished top 10 in solo showdown, he is also a well known pro in the destiny community. 

I also own a XIM as i was going to learn to use KM but never bothered, what i can tell you his movement looks fluid like he does use one, however as i only play on 6 sensitivity i can not say that 9.8 that he plays on would not look like this..

Also for people saying he is changing guns so he can not be using KM that does not work like that on an XIM, you still have to cycle through guns.

I personally think this guy is clean and is a legit winner...

So heres the main parts of the story. I bought the 59.99 vbuck package on july 12th, 6:40pm according to the email from sony I got. This was right as the servers crashed. I wasnt able to login for hours after this. Sitting in the queue forever. 

I didnt I noticed receive the vbucks, I thought whatever itll show up on a reboot. It didnt. I saw on Twitter others were having an issue too so I waited until the next day and contact sony. Live chat, they made me do the restore license and deactiactivate and reactivate my ps4 as primary. Didnt work. They said that they added the license to my account and that it should work and I needed to contact the publisher. 

So I email them with all the info they need. NO ANSWER FOR 2 MORE DAYS. So before that, I was mad. Falling behind on the battlepass etc... so I do another purchase on july 14th and send epic back a response saying to cancel the original and refund my money. 

That's where it gets ********, this guy named callum immediately sends me back a email saying that epic can only refund purchases on PC and I needed to deal with sony for that. So I get back on chat with sony and they see I've already been in contact with them and tell me they would not refund my purchase and that it's a valid transaction and I needed to go ti epic to figure it out. Now I'm heated with the ring around. I tell them the easy solution is to dispute the charge on my credit card due to them not honoring the purchase and was told immediately that while that would get me the money back that I would be banned. So I ask, so you're gonna ban my account because I disputed a purchase that hasnt been honored? He confirmed yes and sent me to the policy and terms. 

I email epic back and callum responds TWO more days later saying that I'm to goto sony with all refunds. I said forget the refund. Just give me the vbucks. He says in a response 4 minutes later that I am not in the computer system and the purchase cant be verified. 

So one last time I get back on sony, they due jack **** and push me out the door. They did give me a transaction I'd. Number and I sent that back to this Callum guy whopick and chooses when to respond while offering no recourse and asking questions like what and where this purchases was made so we can solve this. 

That leaves me at thus moment waiting on a response. What is going on? What else or how else do I go about this? Epic should know by doin the math that I didnt receive them. It's been 6 days total.

It's unfortunate that Epic doesn't seem to want to address this issue. 

&gt;If you paid attention to the last solo showdown and it's results, you saw that the majority of winners were console players. This is probably in part due to there being more console players in general (although I'm not sure how to verify that), but it is actually the exact opposite of what I would have expected.

&gt;One would expect the skill gap in this game to be a lot larger on PC than it is on console. Watching top streamers on each platform makes it very clear that PC has a much higher skill ceiling (yes Nickmercs is a god I know, my point still stands). Basically what I'm saying is that the gap between top players and average players should be significantly greater on PC than it is on console, and therefore one would expect the majority of solo showdown winners to be PC players.

&gt;Yet the majority of winners were console players. I understand this is a controversial topic on this subreddit, but my 'hypothesis' is that this is the result of a separate tier of console players that extend the skill gap beyond what it is on PC. Keyboard and mouse users on console essentially gain the advantage of PC playstyles while maintaining the opponents of console. Even top PC players cannot keep up with the winrates of KBM console users.

&gt;Now normally these elite KBM users aren't that big of a deal because there aren't that many of them among the millions of console fortnite players, but in a competitive scene like solo showdown where only the top 100 players in the world on any platform are recognized, the effects are a lot more obvious.

&gt;I'm not saying KBM support should be removed since I know that's controversial here (and also xims exist), but maybe Epic should consider separating PC and console rankings in solo showdown and other competitions

&gt;Tldr: KBM use creates a massive console skill gap, results in console players dominating solo showndown. Separate rankings pls

It only makes people less happy if u cant buy a skin because its rare and it hasn't been in the shop for super long. It just would be much better if everyone could just buy the skin they want, and that ""rarity"" of skins doesn't exist.

I think that Epic games shouldn't have made skins that are seasonal and will never return to the shop. (Outside of battle pass skins) it only creates discussions and arguments whether they should re-release or not, etc.

i wanted to address a problem a lot of friends and I have while playing on console. I'm talking about ""Pc-players"", people who play with mouse and keyboard on console.

In the beginning when Fortnite came out there were a lot of bad players and almost noone knew how to really play the game.  Many didnt even know that you can play with mouse and keyboard on console.  But since the game blew up i noticed more and more people were playing with mouse and keyboard. I dont mean that there is a ""little ninja"" in every game, but like every 10th game, i encounter K&amp;M-Player who destroy everyone and have like 15-30 kills. You could think that they are good console players(controller). I also have this insane games but since i played a ton of this game i notice it if someone plays with K&amp;M or controller. So my point is:  


1. I dont even get why you can play with M&amp;K on console. If you wanna play M&amp;K go play on PC, the game is f2p.

\- I think this is pretty much self explanatory

2.It's extremely unfair for players like me who play with controller since aiming ist easy as hell with mouse and way more precise. Also you can set keybinds and building is way easier and faster with M&amp;K. You simply cant compete with a m&amp;k player when playing with controller when the m&amp;k player knows what he is doing.

\- One could argue that Im a noob and dont know how to play the game, but i have over 500 wins on console and like 80(mostly squads, since playing with friends) on Pc. I play on a sensitivity of 8 and overall i would say that Im an overaverage player. I also tried m&amp;k on console and holy shit, it's ridiculous. I dropped at least four 20+bombs in the short time i was playing and my personal best which i got with controller was 15. And Im  not even as close as good as some of the pc players. I'm not talking about pros, just in general, good players.

\-Also, dont tell me ""BUT YOU HAVE AIMASSIST"". That's an argument i cant take seriously because the aimadvantage you gain with m&amp;k is way  better.

So in conclusion:

 Epic just take m&amp;k away from console. There are no arguments for keeping it. If there are any, please tell me.

However  there is a simple solution that exists:  


Dont take it out but just queue the m&amp;k-Players with PC- Players so that console players who play with controller dont have to play against m&amp;k-players. Shouldnt be too hard to realize since crossplatform already exists.

PS.

This is my firt reddit post. Hope it's not too long and you can understand my point.",FortNiteBR

I neee tips on how to git gud/ compete with them! I play on Xbox and Switch.,"Either i cant aim or my opponents are just WAY better players than me and simply out play me. I aprieciate a good 0.5 gun fight because a drum gun or smg just decided all the shots will land and i get smelted.

""Just build lol"" okay lets build oh look at that default was carrying rocket launcher drum gun and smg wow what an optimal set, fucking genuis compostion. Okay let me fire back.

*KA KA KA KA KACHI DAZE!!* oh wow look at him just fucking dodge all my bullets even though my recitcle is  directlly on his head 10-30 meters away.  Oh, but all his LMG hits land?  Wow whata great player, i was outplayed.

I really need advice. I can use hunting rifle beacuse THEY DONT HAVE BLOOM WHEN ZOOMING IN and i land most my headshots with them. I just need help on what guns to use and how to use because i cant use guns properly, my opponents use them way better.

For example, if my opponent and i have a scar and i 
Shoot my bullets purposefully ignore his hitbox and he takes no damage and when he  fires back while jumping  all the shot land. How do they do that?

Oh, and just today i was fighting a player. I was shooting at his body with a green ar. We were both crouching, and he had the new smg (GRA).. He destroyed me even though his weapon has worse bloom than mine and i started shooting first. I think he  Use a no bloom hack.

Oh, and how do you build properly. People seem to simply Ignore my stairs or walls like they dont fucking exist even  and i dont understand. But when they build the gane is wuick to though my ass  of a mountain or build fight. I build stairs to block them off but they jump through and 1 pump me. Its very annoying.

And when i wanna build a wall in front of me it build 2 tiles away. I feel like i am missing a KEY FACTOR on building directly  in front of my so i dont get shot. 

1 last thing, Can you guys name some locations were guns are Garebteed to spawn? Sometimes i land at a location, and i need a gun fast cause orher savages want my ass. So im loot the whole building and either i find all healing or 5 revolvers. 

I hope revolver gets vaulted because its fucking garbage fam. 2 tiles away headhot does 84-96 damage? Are you kiddingnme the drop off starts after one tile? Absolutely absurd my god.

I just think i am a bad player overall. My building is ineffective and so is my aim and computation skill. Plz help me and give some advice.

TL;DR I  am gonna take a long ass break from this game and comeback when bloom is patched. Im sick of getting shredded by shitty players cause my shots just wonder off 
Where ever they fucking want.though i will do daily and weekly challenges for battle pass thats it.

My friend, who plays on Xbox always compares our K/Ds and wins and tries to roast me because he has a slightly better K/D and more wins. I try to tell him that it is harder to win on PC. Which is harder then, PC or Xbox?

I know that Xbox is harder to control and stuff but I’m talking about PC vs PC against Xbox vs Xbox. 

Two main points of my argument:

1. PC has all those twitch streamers I always get killed by (I never see any xbox twitch streamers)

2. In Xbox, everyone has the same “set-up”. No other players will have an advantage over you like in PC from having a super good computer or the top gaming equipment.",FortNiteBR

Look week 2 summer skirmish is an event focused on streamers. Notice how we arent watching the commentators behind a desk?

the format of the competition is streamer spectator style with commentary overlay.

I would really like to watch idropz games, honestly because i want to see a good player. Hes number 1 right now with over 90 points in 3 games, BUT we literally havent seen any gameplay from him.

Not a drop. Because hes not streaming.

Just seems like an another oversight by epic to me. We cant watch half the people playing and see their *epic* plays because they arent streaming... Whats the point of the casters then? IDK. Seems like every week has an issue, something friday fortnite never had ironically.

However, I do have to say their recent tournaments have been super flawed. The first summer skirmish competition had a huge amount of lag since Epic didn't anticipate all the building that would occur (even though it's kind of obvious it would happen since it's a lobby full of streamers). Now they are grouping PS4 and xbox players into a tournament system heavily based on the amount of kills? Absolutely outrageous. 

It's no secret that PC is extremely hard in comparison to consoles. And it's easy to tell just looking at the leader boards, which are littered with xbox and PS4 players garnering 20 kills a game. Meanwhile top PC players like Tfue, Ninja, ect, aren't even making top 10. Epic really needs to fix this issue and in my opinion put a lot more thought into these tournaments before they occur. It seems that every tournament Epic has fallen short in one way shape or form. I love you Epic, but there's alot of money riding on the line for such little thinking.",FortNiteBR

I've been playing the game since early January and I use to stream the game 'twitch.tv/bioarch' I'm a very competitive player and I have high hopes of getting on a good team. I have spent a lot of money on my account which included a lot of the Christmas skins. I also have maxed out Battle Passes every season since S2. I have put a lot of time and effort into this game and have grinded so much on my account. I was looking to play Fortnite for a very long time because I really enjoy the game and just working towards becoming better every day. Today was no different then any other day I logged on looking to play and grind out my Battle Pass but the first game I got in it kicked me out and I recieved a message 'You were removed from the match due to your IP,VPN, machine, or cheating'. I thought ok well I don't know what this is about maybe it's a new bug so I went in another match and got the same results so then I searched online about it and apparently a lot of people are getting this without any explanation and no response or help from support. So I reinstalled the game but that didn't work so I thought maybe it was something with my PC so I reinstalled windows and downloaded Fortnite again but ran into the same problem. After multiple attempts, I couldn't figure out why I was still getting this message so then I made a new account and I was able to get into a game just fine. Then I knew it had to be something with my account so I did more research and it said it's usually nothing just give it 24 hours and it should be cleared up. So I decided to do that but while waiting I notice my Epic games client crashed and when I tried to log back into my account I got a message saying my account was disabled and it was either disabled because I requested it or the account was banned for misconduct. I don't know why this happened but there is no one for me to contact to get it situated so I'm reaching out hoping to get Epics attention to get this resolved. I would be devastated if I couldn't get this resolved and I don't have more money to put into a new account so I would be forced to quit. Please, someone, help me to get this situated I don't want to lose my account!

About now, a large proportion of players in BR who have obtained the battle pass have completed the majority of their challenges. However, they may be struggling with a simple one: finding a supply llama. Seems easy, but this game will always hate you, so when you look for one: you will never find it. I would assume if you haven't found one yet, you've spent some time googling the spawn locations, or the density in which it is most likely to appear. Using this strategy works... sometimes. It is luck, not what some youtube video has told you. 

*My advice to those struggling with it is literally just to play the game. Grind experience., grind tiers and other challenges, do whatever you want, but play the game and keep an eye open for detail. You will never know when the llama will be just around the corner when you are playing normally. Seemingly, the more you hunt for it, the less likely you are to stumble upon one. Play games, try to play for wins and at some point you will find one.*

Remember that you have a whole season to do this challenge, and more than likely you will find plenty per season. It does not have to be completed in that week span, you can span it across multiple weeks and it can be done by playing the game naturally.

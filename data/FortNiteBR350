Apart from the endless wood supply this location is by far the worst location. The only ""structure"" is the maze and it has about 4 chests MAX. The maze is heavily contested when the bus is near and the worst mode to play on is squads as their is no loot to supply the lot of you. The best is solos but you will probably not win the game.

18:lonely lodge
This location is just a sub sector of wailing and the lodges are full of bad/no loot. The only good thing is that there is a large sniping tower for scouting. It is above wailing because of the structures and camps.

17:shifty shafts 
Shifty is one of the worst locations to land but is above the other two because of loot. The tunnels provide cover but if your not the person for shotgun battles then your screwed. The tunnels are confusing and because it is near tilted people drop here to gather loot. The only good thing is the two opposite houses that have a few chests but are not the best.

16:Dusty depot 
Dusty is again a bad location to drop as the 3 warehouses have bad loot and one or two chests MAX. This place is also heavily contested and in squads can be covered in player made forts. Normally if you land here you don't make top 50.

15:junk junction 
Junk is a location not bad for loot but for positioning. It is in the NW corner of the map and offers lots of metal. The metal takes along time to mine and usually the storm overruns it quickly.

14:greasy grove
Greasy is a location that used to be good but was nerfed. The burger bar has little to no loot but the houses are ok. It is still heavily contested and is best in solos.

13:Fatal fields 
Fatal is the opposite of Anarchy. This location is ok because of loot but I never have reason to come here because of Anarchy. The barn,Farm house and stables are looted quickly so be fast.

12:flush factory
This was the last named location I dropped at and I think it is ok but has been nerfed and made worse. The only good thing is the resources the toilets give. The chests spawns have also increased and have dropped me SCARS.

11:haunted hills
Haunted is not the worst or best location. I have had luck here and I have found scars and snipers. The church and chapel provide multiple chests but this location is to be avoided in squads.

10:tomato town
WOW REALLYR U MAD BRUV yes I like tomato because of the restaurant. Their is a very good trap spot at the kitchen to counter doorway and I have gotten many kills from this. The houses are good but not for squads or duos. Best for solos.

9:lucky landing
Yes again I like a bad location mainly because of the loot and kills. The location has a lot of resources and you can find many chests. The tree in the middle is cool aswell.

8:salty springs
This location is a good spot but is hard to see while skydiving. I wouldn't land here in squads but duos is good.

7:pleasant park
Pleasant is a very good location because it is usually in the circle. It has good loot and you can bank lots of kills here.

6:retail row
Retail is a very good location because of its location and loot. The mall and shops provide tons of loot and you can bank 5 to 10 kills here.

5:loot lake
For me loot lake is a barrier and could be better if boats could be rowed. I do like the factories and the house in the middle as you have an advantage over everyone else depending on the storm.

4:moisty mire 
Moisty is by far one of the best remote locations in fortnite. The trees give tons of wood and you get 10 chests MAX to yourself in solos or duos or even squads. It is also close to the prison.

3:Tilted Towers
Tilted is one of the few good locations I barely drop at because of overpopulation. I do get lots of kills but I also get killed too.

2:snobby shores
Snobby is a very good location as it gives you Loot,kills and resources. There are 5 houses(Nuclear bunker,Pool house,mansion,old house and South house) it is usually far from the circle though.

1:..........Anarchy Acres
Yes I know I love this location as it is full of good loot and I get lots of kills too. The loot runs out quick but if you land at it you are not far from the circle.

They say that even when they've got full shields, health, weapons etc and they're ready to roll there's always something killing them before they can even figure out what to do. Be it a shotgun or rocket launcher or just having someone throw walls in their face, they feel like they're not getting a chance to learn how to play the game properly.

I try to explain stuff while playing but as soon as they die 5 games in a row within the first few minutes they just jump onto another game. Does anyone else think this game has too much of a harsh learning curve now? 

The biggest thing they have issue with is common weapons like the sub and revolver being so hard to use and unless they grab a shotgun it's too hard for them. We're all in our late 20s so obviously we only game on the weekends so time is precious. 

I really do enjoy the game and want them to do the same, aside from getting them to watch tips videos (which aren't translating in game very well), I can't think of what else to tell them.

Winning is not always the best indicator if you are good at fortnite as the possibility of you winning is 1/100 and getting 8 kills but losing doesnt mean you sucked. 

Now, I dont think wins are that far off of a close indicator for skill level. While some variations can impact your total, if you are ""good"" youll get some wins to show. Playtime has a lot to do with it as well but try to look at it from a average usage point of view. couple hours a day 4-5 days a week? 

Alot of things depending but if you have 15 plus wins, I think youre probably solid at this game. Regardless of your main mode, i play squads and duos most, you should have at least 1 of those total wins a solo win... I have over 40 wins with 2 of them being solos. I wouldnt consider myself anything special, but I like to think I am a little above average. My buddy who plays alot more than me has almost 100 wins but he isnt by any means that much better skill wise.

Blue AR is my base to win. Without it, I struggle to win fights let alone matches. As soon as I pull the blue I am golden, regardless of my others I can grind it out. Blue tactical shotty and blue bolt are my compliments. I dig the pump, but i am just very inconsistent in the head shots. Although, them head shots are becoming more common for me ;)

A little background: I'm not new to shooters at all, been playing since Halo: CE, and while I was never amazing, I was always able to hold my own (most recently, for the last few years, I've played an (un)healthy amount of COD). However, not when it comes to this game. I must have played at least 200 matches where I've dropped in tilted, and I consistently get my ass handed to me. I know it's not the bloom, or the randomness, as there are many people who consistently get the kills. Just not me. I simply cannot get a hang of the shooting mechanics of this game. 

To top it all off, the time between engagements is way too long. Load into the lobby, get into the pregame area, wait for the bus to launch, wait to finally land, look for a weapon like a madman (not counting the 25% of times I don't even get a chance to find a gun and I get blasted in the face), get into an engagement finally, only to die instantly. Rinse repeat. I can't really tell anymore if I'm having any fun, as it's more frustrating than any game I can ever remember.

As for things I've tried, you name it, I've tried it. Every possible variation of sensitivity, bunny hopping, crouching, waiting to shoot, shooting right away etc etc. So often I'm convinced I got the headshot, but I die anyway. I'm almost at the point where I want to give up (not sure why I haven't yet, something crazy about this game where no matter how infuriated I get, I keep coming back for more punishment).

I'm not 100% sure what the point of this post is, maybe it's just to vent, but if there is one request I have is for Epic to create some kind of practice/training mode where I can get into engagements far quicker than in game. As a grown man, I simply do not have the 8 hours a day to grind this game to get the amount of practice needed to ""git gud"".

A person with a green assault rifle can out build and outaim someone with a scar

But it's pretty dumb, however, in most games the winner isn't decided by positioning or aiming or outbuilding, but by who happens to have found an explosive weapon. Someone who's able to grenade launcher a building from the safety of their walls against someone who doesn't have that is at such a huge advantage that there's really nothing the other person can do.

1)**The skins get overused in time**- I really like the Rust Lord skin when it started out but seeing it around all the time in every game got boring. After reaching tier 100, all of the skins I obtained from the S3 pass feel exactly like the default skin.

2)**It feels like a chore**: I don't want to HAVE to play the game daily, I don't want to drop in a game with a particular goal in mind (eliminations at a place, etc), or monitor my daily challenges all the time. It took the fun out of the game when I was trying to go for chests in one place, or get eliminations with a particular weapon.

3)**It become a distraction**: Not all challenges can be done at once. I find it distracting to have this pending task, and I just dont want something like that to force me to play a game.

I get that you can make your vbucks back from the battle pass, but for me the method to get to Tier 100 isn't enjoyable, at which point I'm basically doing a chore I don't enjoy for vbucks.

Upon activating it, the map would be brought up promting the user to select a location to teleport to. 

I know this sounds overpowered, being able to both completely escape the storm and battles that are about to be lost. To counter this, the teleporter would take a long time to charge up (around 5-10 seconds), it would make a very loud noise that would alert enemies to your position. Something else that would make it more balanced is a large beam shooting from the sky in the location that you've teleported to telling everyone in the viscinity that you've just teleported. 

All in all the teleporter would provide us with new opportunities to flank, out-manouver the storm and hit those supply drops whilst providing enough disadvantages to the user to make it balanced.

It is meant to be that of a nice suggestion, with the hope the Epic would take it into consideration! As my boyfriend said, I have the tone of ""a cute, smiley girl"" so he read it as such, but text posts leave a lot of room for tone interpretation. Plus, I genuinely feel that Epic as a business will profit more if some of these changes were implemented. Thanks for your feedback, everyone!


To start this off, I want to say that I'm not one to normally complain about game design nor gender inequality. Yet as an avid player of both PvE and PvP, I feel invested in Fortnite and have been recently let down with some of the gender inequality among the PvP skins and within the PvP store. With the recent release of the Brite Gunner and the Sunshine &amp; Rainbows back bling, I felt I had to say something, even if just on Reddit.


Firstly, Epic has finally released the [Sunshine &amp; Rainbows back bling](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/fortnite-back-bling-brite-bag-768x629.jpg)! But there's a catch, it is only available on the new [Brite Gunner](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-brite-gunner-full.jpg), and was not released for the [Brite Bomber](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-brite-bomber-hd.jpg) skin owners. In my opinion, the back bling is very clearly meant to match the female skin; the Bomber skin has a llama and rainbow just like the back bling, while the Gunner has a teddy bear with guns. It honestly feels like Epic stuck a back bling that was meant to be released for the Brite Bomber onto the new male version of the skin. It feels like an attempt to make more money off of those players who already own the Brite Bomber skin.


This leads me to my bigger topic of discussion (which, I believe, could actually lead to more monetary profit for Epic in the long run).


Epic, PLEASE start making the skins more equally split between male/female. You should have a male &amp; female version of each skin. (Where is the female equivalent of the [Raven](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-raven-full.jpg) skin?) I will say that I have recently seen an increase in the number of skin themes with versions of both genders available. This is a step in the right direction. But there are still some inequalities that stand out to me.


• Both male &amp; female versions of a skin should either have a back bling, or should not. This would also require that both versions of the skin are the same rarity - a problem seen with the Sunshine &amp; Rainbows set. (See above.)

• Both male &amp; female versions of a skin should be available in the store at the same time. There is no worse feeling than when only the male or female skin version that I want is unavailable for another week, while its matching counterpart stares at me from the in-game store.

• Battle Pass skin unlocks should have an equal split between genders. The Season 3 Battle Pass had four male skins, but only two female skins. This is very frustrating! One possible solution could be that when a player unlocks a skin by tiering up in the battle pass, they should simply be able to choose one of the two skins - the male or female version.

• A matching counterpart to a Battle Pass skin should not be available only via purchase. A prime example of this is the [Dark Voyager](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-dark-voyager-hd.jpg) male skin (unlocked via Battle Pass) and the [Dark Vanguard](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-dark-vanguard-full.jpg) female skin (unlocked via purchase). That feels completely unfair to one gender. 

• Some of the male/female versions of one skin set are a bit too different. For example, the [Rex](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-rex.jpg) skin and [Tricera Ops](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-tricera-ops-full.jpg) skin are likely meant to complete a male/female set. But they have a bit of a gap in their design. What if I want a cute Rex outfit on a female player model, so my green skin allows me to camp in bushes more easily? What if my male friend wants a bright red Tricera Ops male skin to catch other players' eyes and start more gunfights? I feel like a little bit of extra work to accommodate such designs on both male and female player models will make your player base much happier! Skin sets like that of [Hyperion](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fortnite-outfit-hyperion.jpg) and [Dazzle](https://progameguides.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fortnite-outfit-dazzle.jpg) are great examples of a male/female complementing set that don't differ too much!

• Both male and female versions of a skin should be released at the same time. Rex was released much in advance of Tricera Ops. Dark Vanguard came out way after the Battle Pass and, therefore, Dark Voyager. 


With the popularity of this game and the increase in the number of female gamers and streamers out there (like myself), please keep the female gamer audience in mind when designing! Thank you for the consideration, and we appreciate all the hard work Epic already puts into making Fortnite so great!

The only reasons you wouldn't would be if you get a lucky head shot or there isn't anyone else there. If you land and find only a revolver by the time someone starts shooting at you, chances are they have literally any other gun in the game and will kill you. If you happen to hit him in the body, you still have to wait 3 seconds to get another shot off and you will probably miss still because it is so inaccurate.

Imagie firing the perfect sniper shot at someone, ""It's gonna be a headshot from 600m away!"" you say to yourself. But before the bullet hits, they do the flippin' sexy emote and the bullet sails right over them and instead of them dying, they now know your location because sniper rifles are loud. And because they never died from the shot, they eventually track where you are and shotgun you from behind, now *you're* dead because of the emote. **Hey Epic, doesn't the shop say that anything bought is purely cosmetic and doesn't provide any gameplay PvP advantages?**

Calling it an advantage may be a bit of a stretch, but paying for an item that changes your hitbox is still an advantage, and slightly pay2win. And like in the example above, can make you loose the game, because you died from not killing that one guy.

The sad thing is, this happens to people. It actually happens more often than people think. There's many internet posts, both on this subreddit and other places, of this happening to both sides; people not being able to kill someone because of the hitbox change, and people using a paid emote to avoid taking damage that they would've otherwise taken if they hadn't used (or been able to use) the emote. And these posts get *thousands* of upvotes/likes, which means they get a lot of attention, so it's not a ""secret"" or ""hidden"" feature of the game. Lots of people know about this, and many people have fallen victim to and abused the hitbox change. 

My suggestion is to have your hitbox not change while using emotes (including the headshot position) so that long distance shooters aren't scammed out of a possibly fatal shot. It's a paid advantage that makes the game slightly more unfair, since some players simply cannot use the emotes to their advantage. I'm not trying to say Fortnite is a pay2win game (at least in battle royale), but this feature definitely emits a pay2win aspect, that being able to dodge bullets.",FortNiteBR

About an hour ago, I queued into Squads with fills. My team had no mics (or rather, they were in their own private party), but it was very intense. I had countless knocks and hits on other people and wiped out a squad to save my team. Then, as the rest of my squad eventually died, it was just me and a John Wick left.

He boxes himself in and puts four traps on the walls. Suddenly, I hear a voice pop into my headphones, that of a nine-year-old who sounds like he just swallowed some helium and a ridiculous amount of estrogen...

""HURRY UP! Hurry the fuck up, you Indian fuck! He's RIGHT below you! If you don't win this game, I will find out where you live and I will MURDER you!""

He proceeded to call me other things, like the N-word (I'm white, btw) and a 'bitch', and I had pressured the last guy enough that I knocked off his shield. Then, the bloom of my SMG went to the lower part of my cone and destroyed the platform I was on, causing me to fall to my death.

His friend just laughed, which I had no issues with, but the other kid kept squealing at me, saying that he would find my IP address and stab me to death. I think I should've reported the little brat for his piss-poor manners, but for some ungodly reason I decided not to.

It doesn't help that I don't have very many friends I can play with. I either need squadmates, or should just stick to solos for now. This kind of shit makes me stomach sick.",FortNiteBR

The basics would be that we would all queue up at the same exact time, on the same exact server to accomplish something similar to the Wake Ceremony. Every Thursday we’d have a different challenge/theme. For example, maybe totaling Wailing Woods, Building a Giant Skybase, Pickaxe Battles, the list goes on. We’d use the least populated server at that time and set a specific time for every Thursday (comment what times work for you so that we can all come to an agreement)

So, how can we get this movement going? First off, in order to gain some traction we’re obviously gonna need some upvotes. This is so that as much people as possible can view this original post so they know what’s going on and discuss what times work best for everyone on *Thursday*. Everything (rules, time, location, challenge/mission, etc.) will be organized via my Reddit, and will then be posted on my Twitter @xsqoof

Granted, there *will* be some trolls that will try to grief our events but that’s why the set rules will include a unique combination of outfits/backbling/glider/location so that we know who is taking part in the Queue Night event. Obviously, since we don’t have custom games as of yet, completing something like this is not possible without this idea. But once we *do* get custom games, things like this will obviously be a lot more organized.

before anyone says I’m “doing this for the views” I’d like to address that that’s not true. The reason I’m doing this is so that we all have something unique to experience just like we did with the Tilted Towers Wake Ceremony. I received a ton of amazing support from that and a bunch of people were genuinely happy that we actually accomplished what we did without anything but a Reddit post. I thought that was pretty amazing. The Tilted Towers Wake Ceremony also received a ton of positive from tons of different gaming media sights such as IGN and Polygon, etc. There were tons of posts on Twitter, Instagram, and the front page of Reddit about it and I was genuinely shocked that we actually accomplished something so grand.

So please, if you do want to see this movement go somewhere and if you think it’d be a unique and fun experience, please help it gain traction and support from this amazing community. I genuinely believe we can do this. Because in the end, this isn’t just about me, it’s about the entire community and all the things we can accomplish for content and enjoyment.

Feel free to DM me on Reddit or Twitter @xsqoof with any further questions/concerns/input, it would all be *greatly* appreciated.

make sure to stay tuned for when these events take place as I’ll be streaming them for those that can’t participate and want to watch. And this time, everything will me *much* more organized than the first time.

More and more I'm coming across ultra defensive/passive/campy players and more and more I'm losing out to them and their corny/cheap strategies. People boxing themselves in, hiding in buildings, running away, spamming rockets at the slightest hint of danger. 

Whilst I appreciate these are all valid strategies and have their place in a BR, my worry is more with the fact that playing aggressively or even semi-aggressive is now becoming more of a handicap. And again, I appreciate there should be some element of risk in running an aggressive play style, I feel that the game is slowly and subtly making this less of a viable option.

I'm coming across less and less aggressive players in the top 10 and I guess this is the proof in the pudding... Maybe. 

I used to love the fact that in this game you could choose a play style and rock it but it's starting to feel like I have less of a choice these days.

People that spend money on something tend to be more devoted to it, therefore they usually play a lot and get good at the game over time. Now, there are a few exceptions like for example a youtuber could be trash but want his videos to be of the highest quality with the newest cosmetics. I’m not saying that all the no skins are awful I’m just explaining why other people think they are. Let’s say you’re at the bowling alley and you see someone with a sweet bowling ball that obviously isn’t from the bowling alley and you see someone with a ball that the bowling alley provides for you, who do you think is going to be better? Probably the guy with the expensive bowling ball. The same concept applies here as well. Thanks for reading :)",FortNiteBR

As the end of season 3 and the space theme draws near, the upcoming season has a high chance of being a superhero theme. Now, what better transition from a space to a superhero theme than hinting at the destruction of a giant city, and then having a superhero save the day and stop the meteor?

To me, it's a casual feature which closes the skill gap between players, as building is by far the most important tool get good at.

The refund system allows you to refund something that you bought in the past 30 days. By enabling it now, people can refund their previous purchases. People knowing that it was enabled, they wait for it to be enabled again and they do not purchase new v-bucks because they know they will get more from refunding stuff.

So Epic's strategy is to keep it disabled for a total of 30 days, so when it will be enabled, people will have no way of getting v-bucks back, so they will just have to puchase more.

Shame on Epic if my theory is correct.

I lost the opportunity to buy Shadow Ops, Plunja and more because they disabled it. Now I will lose the opportunity to refund a legendary skin that I do not like because of this. :( Not fair for the community.

489,OrignalSpartan,1524896956,8fi6nw,24,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8fi6nw/long_detailed_post_on_how_a_ranked_mode_would/,0,Long Detailed Post on how a Ranked mode would work in fortnite,"Let me first say how benefical a Ranked mode would be for fortnite.
Alot of the ""Sweats"" would abandon casual play for Ranked leaving a healthy Normal mode for new players to learn without getting destroyed every game by tier 100 john wicks. 

There alot of other benefits to this but ill continue with how it works. Many people down vote ""Ranked posts"" because the author gives no suggestion on how the mode will work leaving it to epic which could end up making a bad mode.

First some clarifications 

     •Every idea below is not set in stone and can be added to or removed entirely
     •Ranked will have a SEPERATE Stats/Leaderboards. GLOBAL WINS for casual play should stay seperate for the casual and ranked gamemode however the Ranked Leaderboard will work more fairly and be based on different stats.
      •Ranked mode will be SOLOS only until enough data is gathered on how to implement it to duos and squads.


How it works
           •there will be 4 Main divisions Plus a top 100 Grand masters Division for each platform and seperate region. 
                            •Examples PC Northamerican Leaderboard.    PC Europe Leaderboard, PS4 Asian Leaderboard, Xbox NorthAmerican Leaderboard. PS4 Oceanic Leaderboard, PS4 Northamerican Leaderboard. ETC.

•Divisions

Bronze Division Everyone starts here.

Silver division you enter this division when you exceed 200 points

Gold division  you enter this division when you exceed 500 points

Diamond Division you enter this division when you exceed 1000 points

Masters division you enter this division when you exceed 2000 points 

Grandmasters division is for the top 100 players in masters


            •Ranking up and down
Playing Ranked instills a risk/reward as any ranked gamemode should. Each game your performance can lead to you gaining points or losing them.
             • Each ranked gam3 will have up to 50 players to decrease the hectic RNG you could have with 100. 50 players allows each player suffcient breathing room early game to farm up so you have a fair chance to possibly win.
             • Ranked games cost points to queue 
Bronze Queue costs 2points
Silver Queue costs 4
Gold Queue costs 6
Diamond Queue Costs 8
Masters/GM Queue costs 10
              • Each kill in a ranked game rewards you with 1 point and every person you out live in TOP 20 awards you one point. If you win the game you are also Refunded the Queue cost.
              • Examples if you are in a Gold queue and get 10 Kills but died in 25th place you are rewarded 10points subtract the 6 points it costed to play the ranked game and you earn a total of 4 points.
 if you are a Diamond player and earned two kills but died on 10th place you earned 12 points subract the Diamond queue cost of 8 and you are left with 4 points earned. 
If you are in masters and win a game with 1 kill you earn 20 points for outliving the top 20, one point for the kill you got, and a refund of the queue cost so (1+20+10) -10 = 21 points earned.

This system creates a healthy incentive to not sit in a bush all game but also to not be a crazy chad and triple ramp rush any soul you see.

     • Each new ranked player plays 5 cost free placement games and starts out with 100 points in bronze.
• if you drop down to 0 points game become cost free until you earn some points.

At the end of each season you are rewarded with a back bling sheild with your division Sigil on it and the season number.

Every new season your points are cut in half, if you some how have more than 4000 points in masters they are cut to 2000 points.



I hope i explained this well enough if you have any input on better ideas or any criticism please comment below so i can update the post or provide a rebuttel. 

Sorry again for the long post but thank you if you read the whole thing.




EDIT: let me add Matchmaking will work with a queue timer. The game will search for 50 other people in your division for up to 2minutes. If it cant find them it will search for people 1 division under you. 
Ranked Matchmaking will be slower than casual matchmaking but i see this as a sacrifice to have more quality matchmaking. A bronze player should never play against a Gold player and up.

I was super excited when I received the notification of the tweet, but at the time I was at University with no way of getting home for 3 more hours. As I was making my way back to finally get rid of the dragon glider (which I accidentally bought and have regretted it since) and to my disappointment Epic had removed the feature not 2 hours after they released it. I figured, well they want to hash out details and will come back with a fixed version of it. They have not, however delivered such fix and have not given us any information on it.
My question is, mainly, if you guys could increase the time frame from 30 days to, say, 45 or 50. This would compensate the days which we have not been able to refund, as by the time it fully comes out, more than 30 days will have passed since my purchase.

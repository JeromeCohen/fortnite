We need an option to disable crouch building.  When other game-play changes were added to the game(auto-build, auto-run, etc.) you've given us the option to disable these changes and continue to play the game the way were accustomed to.  Please, Epic, give us this same option.

To those who are inevitably going to tell me that I can jump to get out of crouch while building, I am fully aware of this option.  Unfortunately, after playing this game for so long it's almost impossible to rewire my brain at this point.  Being used to opening build and sprint while building has turned into opening build-&gt;jump-&gt;sprint-&gt;build.  Sounds easy enough on paper, but when in the heat of combat it actually turns into something like opening build-&gt;try to sprint build-&gt;stuck in crouch-&gt;begin to freak out&gt; get out of build-&gt; uncrouch-&gt;open build again-&gt;dead :/.",FortNiteBR

Skydiving: When dropping at the begging of the game, it always freezes. When gliding up to a building, it sometimes takes up to 10 - 15 seconds for the buildings to render. Also even if the building is rendered in, and you land you will rubber banded off.

Gun Battles: Majority of the time when in a gun battle, at the beginning of the game it lags, and you end of dying. Also when your character is behind a structure, and you are in a gun fight you end up getting shot even if you're behind a building. Also when in a battle missing your target and dying because your aiming reticle takes a full second to respond to your input is an entirely different level of frustration.

**There are plenty of other issues when it comes to lag in the game, but these are just the main ones. This has been talked about repeatedly, but you guys never take the time to address it. We don't need to be worrying about new game modes, or guns, when we cant even play the game it self. I am currently playing on the xbox one, but I know its happening across most platforms, besides maybe PC. This is a great game, and actually its one of best games I've played in a long time, but this needs to be taken care of.**",FortNiteBR

3,TheMrDrock,1521816787,86l8ae,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/86l8ae/high_tier_console_players_ps4/,0,High Tier Console Players (PS4),"Yeah, yeah, go ahead and make fun of me for even considering anyone not on PC “high tier”. However I really do believe that there are some very talented people on console that are constantly overshadowed by their PC brethren. Getting to my point of this post, I play with a lot of friends on this game, but the skill gap between us is sometimes very frustrating because I don’t like to fort up, but rather I’m a very aggressive player and I find myself in a lot of situations where I’m surrounded with no backup. Nothing against them at all because some of them are really good players, but I really want to experience what some of the big name players experience when they play with one another. By no means am I saying I’m God-tier, but I’d like to think I can handle my own in most situations. To give myself at least a small amount of credibility, here’s my current stats:

Squads: 102 Wins, 770 Matches played
Duos: 33 Wins, 315 Matches played
Solos: 57 Wins, 530 Matches played
 
Please don’t think I’m trying to boast, but rather I’m really just looking for some high tier players to squad up with that we could potentially grow and learn from one another. Hey who knows, maybe esports will even come to console and we can partner up? If you share a similar interest in finding other high tier players and want to squad up on console (PS4) shoot me a message on here or on PSN! Handle is the same for both :)",FortNiteBR

I just recently in the past year got into PC gaming because I finally had the money to do so. Anyways, I play Fortnite on both my PS4 and my PC. (PS4 85 wins) (PC like 6 wins lol).

But the reason for my post is the argument on mouse and keyboard vs a controller. You see, it takes a while to master the use of a mouse and keyboard, I for one, am a couple hundred years behind all of my friends on their ability to adapt. Needless to say I have ragged a few times while we all play and just ended up plugging my controller into my computer. Now please do not hate or kill me but that is where my wins have all come from, not one with a m+k. 

I guess what I’m asking is can someone just simply be better with a controller or am I not giving myself the best opportunity to learn mouse and keyboard? Sorry but this has been bugging me for the past week",FortNiteBR

There's a demand for it but not everyone will speak up in fear of downvotes.  

I for one believe that we need it more than ever and here's why: 

There are too many grenade types.  FortNite isn't your average shooter and that's what makes it one of the top games in the world.  Adding that slot would add variety and goofiness to end games that make that Victory Royale all the more sweet.

On a grand scale, end games are generally the same.  3-4 guns with 1-2 heals.  Occasionally a throwable item.

One argument is that explosions would be non stop.  But who cares? It's war.  It's not like we don't have rocket spammers or grenade launchers.  To remedy this behavior we could cut the 10 stack to 5.  

Before we throw this idea away, why not test it in the next shooting model or a ltm.  I *want* to use impulses or C4, but I would be crazy to drop my rocket launcher for grenades.",FortNiteBR

I sent an email for the support asking what happened why I got banned, The support answer you cheated and we banned your machine https://gyazo.com/9f9ae9ee4ca5b66b8d2369cb6979e005

I reply back asking about the reason or a proof that I am cheating ( wondering if they consider on of my background programs as cheating program or someone reported ) but the surprise they ignore me, YES THEY IGNORE ME, been almost 3 days and they didn't reply back, Also I sent a new email asking for the same reason how am I cheating and still no answer.

I ve been playing games for 6 years and this is this my first time to see something like this, I got banned for latterly no reason I didn't cheat at all, you don't need to believe me look at the states or watch few games and you will be 100% sure that I am not cheating, Even few players pass beside me and I don't notice them.

this is the most bad and worst experience I have ever had, I was fair till my last moment ingame and they didn't even respect me and they didn't even bother to listen to me, after I got banned I immediately changed my windows and verified the game to be safe, I don't think a cheater would care that much to solve a problem.

Shotgun: Its made me rage all night because no one missed headshots on me no matter how much i build or strafe, but i do 30 damage or less 75% of the time. 140 or so wins in and I haven't improved. I don't know what to do because I can't get my aim any better. 

AR: Bloom never gives me headshots. Theres no chance of being consistent beyond 60m with any AR. I see streamers hit Ar shot after Ar shot well beyond 100m just by having the dot on the guy but when i do it my bloom sends everything outside the dot. 

To get wins, I camp the edges, snipe and wait to clean up fights. Everytime i have to build fight I just stay on top and don't shoot because i know it will give them a chance to shoot and everyone has higher damage than me. I'm at the point where I can build with anyone, use snipes or explosives like a pro but I'm relegate to just being good because there is no shotgun or AR consistency for me. 

I've been grinding and trying to get better with them but at 200+ hours nothing is changing and everyone is catching up with the other parts of the game. I can't wait for the shooting test to happen so it finally comes down to skill when shooting ARs and not bloom. I'll just avoid shotgun fights by camping and sniping until then so the John Wick with over 100 wins hiding at the edge of the zone is probably me and now you know why.",FortNiteBR

Possible fix: I’m no game developer but something that could work is lower the render distance for the first 15 second until you land then have it go to normal (not sure if this is for the lag but in some cases I land junk and it still lagged so I’m pretty sure it’s not people lag)

I'm an Xbox Fortnite player with over 100 hours of played-time, and this game has been my favorite hobby over the past few months dating back to around November. If this post gains the attention from anyone at Epic Games, well done and thank you! 

Now, onto my topic of Loot Lake. I strongly think that this area of the map is unnecessary and facilitates a poor gameplay experience. Please take my apology in advance if I sound whiny, that is not my intention! I'm trying to open a discussion with you all regarding Loot Lake and why I think it should be replaced with land. 

In my experience, traveling across the lake is difficult and slow. I often feel pressed to use hundreds of my resources to build a pathway across the lake when pressured by the storm, which is frustrating. The only other option is going around the lake, which doesn't leave players much room for strategic positioning and they can find themselves pinched more often than in the rest of the map. The worst, however, is when the circle ends on the lake. A zone that's majority water creates a poor late-game situation that is clunky to play in. 

Epic, if you do happen to read this, would you mind sharing some thoughts on Loot Lake and comment on a few of the concerns I addressed? Very curious to read what the rest of you think as well. Thanks!

You can't build at them or run toward them so you just keep building single walls and hope they run out of ammo so you can have a real fight.

I have been an active PUBG player since the game came out and was quite confused when Fortnite overtook it in players as I didn't find it that fun. This got me thinking. If fortnite didnt exists would people play PUBG instead? Please vote on the poll and discuss in the comments!

There are many problems with it. For example:

* **Skins showing up too often or too rarely.** Brite Bomber is a classic example of this. This skin has appeared in the shop too much if you compare it to other skins of same or lower rarity. Meanwhile, there are other nice-looking skins that don't show up nearly as much as they should. **The shop's rotation needs to be reconsidered.**

* **Shop is unclear as to what skins have back blings and what skins don't.** People bought Battle Hound thinking the cape was a back bling when it wasn't and they felt cheated for their money (rightfully so). It sucks to buy a more expensive skin thinking that you're getting something extra and find out that you're wrong, especially when the shop is purposefully vague enough to confuse customers into impulse purchases. **We should always be informed if a skin includes a back bling or not.** That brings us to another problem in itself...

* **Skins' pricing is too subjective and inconsistent.** Skins that include back blings are, objectively speaking, more valuable than skins that don't. Thus, they should be priced accordingly. It makes no sense that Legendary skins are released with no back bling whatsoever, while skins of Epic rarity that do contain back blings are released costing less. It feels as if people who bought skins like Wukong and Battle Hound wasted their money, because skins like Highland Warrior (Epic rarity) or Love Ranger (Legendary rarity) not only look nice, but they also include a back bling, an extra item to be used with other skins. Again, this is too inconsistent and subjective. If a skin costs 20$, it should already come with a back bling. You could still give back blings to 15$ skins, just improve the current Legendary skins that don't have back bling. **The shop's prices need to be fair and coherent with its respective skins.**

* **Shop is unclear as to what skins are exclusive and what skins aren't.** I'm constantly seeing people in this subreddit asking if the Skull Trooper will ever be coming back (exclusive skin), while also asking if Red Knight will ever be coming back (non-exclusive skin). I don't blame them. Nothing in the game tells us anything about this. There's no way of knowing about this unless we ask other people in this subreddit for information. It feels awful to hold yourself from buying a skin while thinking it will come back eventually, just to find out that it won't be coming back again. Had we known that the skin wouldn't be coming back, we would've probably bought the skin when we could. **EDIT:** Actually, it shows on the News tab when a skin is in the store ""for a limited time"". However, that statement is unclear as well, because all featured items are technically in the store for a limited time, exclusive or not, only so they can show up again later. **This information needs to be addressed in the store itself at all times, not just on the News tab, and preferably in a less vague manner.**

* EDIT: **There's no two-step confirmation for purchases.** Someone mentioned this in the comments and I'm now adding in to the post. I know that this issue is not as significant as the other ones I pointed it out, but it's still an issue. If there's no confirmation as to what you're buying, this makes it easier for customers to accidentally purchase something they didn't want. Now, those customers will have to send a ticket or an email to your support team, ask for a refund and wait up to 1 month or more for a response. This hassle is unnecessary and easily avoidable. **Implement two-step confirmation for our purchases so we can avoid accidentally buying something.**

Epic, you guys need to be upfront about what you're selling to us. I'm not asking to change your entire business model. Just please, tell us exactly what we are buying and tell us the reason for these pricings. Improve the shop. Listen to us and we will gladly spend more money in your game.",FortNiteBR

In late December of 2017 I won a code for STW right on this subreddit, it was some random guy giving away an extra code he had (thanks btw).

Since then, I completed around half of the STW story (rest isnt finished) and done all dailies and events so far (+couple of timed missions here and there). Payed with money for Renegade Raider, Lucky pickaxe and first battle pass, everything esle was from earned V Bucks from battle passes and STW.

I've put together prices of all other items in locker I own; they are worth 11 950 V Bucks + 1435 V bucks I have now, it adds up to 13 335 V Bucks. Didnt count in : 1000-2000 V bucks I spent on STW Llamas and couple of tiers I bought for first battle pass to get Dark Knight couple of days earlier.

So, in around 3 months Ive earned 13000+ V Bucks. Is STW worth buying? Definetly yes, but you must have time and will to play a bit of STW, not only Battle Royale.

I could somehow recognize some sounds because he was playing on full volume and I asked him: “hey, what are you playing there” – he replied pretty stubborn: “oh, it's just Fortnite®, all of my schoolmates play this game – it's badass”. I didn't tell him that I also regulary play this game with my guy-friends. (but on PC) 
When I dropped all the kids off at school after that ride, I left the bus too, leaned at the door and lit a tasty American Spirit Light Green. I noticed the kids playing around at the bus stop and kind of imitating Fortnite guns and several animations etc. – I just shook my head and got back into the bus. 
When I came home that evening and finished up the tasty Falafel and Hummus that my lovely wife had prepared for me I was just wondering: “why is this necessary – do we really have to design monkey-see-monkey-do games like Fortnite with a military setting”. 
I feel like it is seriously ruining our youth – especially now that it's not just available on console, PC but also on the smartphone! The kids now always(!) have access to start a small war on 3G! It's just too much. 
So I got this Idea in my head to simplify these said monkey-see-monkey-do games to their core so they don't have to take place in a virtual warzone with guns and stuff. It's just a concept at the moment but it works something like this: A 2D space, one hundred players. Each player is represented with a tiny circle. The players move around in this said 2D space and when one circle hits another one it consumes that one and thus increases in size. This goes on and on until only one huge circle is left in the 2D space. That huge circle is the winner of the game. Congrats!",FortNiteBR

As in, one bullet broke his wall, and the next bullet hit the wall he just spammed up. Button held down, no delay between shots.

I love the building mechanics. I love defensive tactics. I *loathe* the efficacy of spamming *a single wall* again and again in point-blank range as a last-ditch desperation move. It reminds me of Armor Lock in Halo: Reach; it's nothing more than a way to buy time and waste the opponent's ammo and it's insanely irritating to fight against.

They can even deny you entry into their tile if you are bearing down against the wall with an automatic if they keep spamming that one wall every microsecond. It's a complete crapshoot whether or not you can actually breach the tile.

They should have options. They should be encouraged to expand outwards and build more, or to time a counter-attack when the wall is broken. They should be encouraged to do literally anything other than spam one wall indefinitely, but that is unfortunately what the game readily rewards the most.

Having a tiny delay on replacing surfaces to discourage this behavior and allow the aggressor to get a couple bullets in after the breach or at least *enter the tile* would solve this without harming any other aspect of the game, I think.",FortNiteBR

Put these people against controllers and it's no doubt there will be a serious performance gap.

As I understand, using a mouse on console actually feels different when compared to using it on PC. However, I don't believe this is grounds for allowing them to play against controller due to the other serious benefits such as building much faster and easily switching between weapons/materials. Put it all together and you get a borderline advantage.  

Now I know what some might say:
&gt;But anyone can use a keyboard and mouse on console Fortnite, so it's fair game.""

- I simply don't believe this is true.

Not everyone will have a keyboard and mouse laying around. But your console came with a controller and that's what sets everyone on a level playing field; you all have and use the same thing.

So in my opinion, I believe if you use a keyboard and mouse on console you should automatically be switched to PC servers.

It's almost unfair for controller users like me who want just want to have some fun with friends but keep getting instantly killed by someone with mouse and keyboard. I wish that Epic would either remove it completely or make mouse and keyboard users play together. It's just unfair for causal gamers like me.

Here are my top 5 reasons for removal:

1. Unfair aim and quick reactions
2. Faster building
3. Faster slot switching
4. More buttons that you can bind than controller

I think everyone is tired of the shotguns for one reason or another (i.e. Fatigue due to overuse, inconsistent dmg, etc.) I feel this would be a good way to make things better overall for the community. There have been people complaining about the pumps damage vs its rarity, and it is a fair complaint imo, but with the new heavy shotgun being epic and legendary, i feel that people would be a little more accepting if they were one shot by it, i know i would be. I feel if they were going to do this though, there would be no real reason to have a purple tac, and purple heavy, so my suggestion would be to lower the qualities of the tac down 1 across the border, maybe making some adjustments to damage if Epic felt the need, and that way there would be a shotgun of every quality in the game. Hell i would even be fine with them keeping the double pump with the heavy shotgun if they went about doing it this way, simply because they are rarer weapons to find (and if you didnt know, double pumping is a thing again with the heavy) I even think if double pumping was a thing again, people wouldnt care so much if the pump was vaulted, it would be a trade off, pump goes away, but you get to keep double pumping heavies to your hearts content. Tell me what you think, i kind of already see how this one is going to go, but i still wanted to throw my two cents in.  

Edit: Just thought of an alternative to vaulting the pump, Lower the tac to gray and green, raise the pump to blue rarity, and then have heavy purple and legendary.

You can spend all game looking for the best weapons in the game, get them, get full health and shield, and then get one shot because someone found a white pump. The only weapon this should be acceptable for are bolt action snipers, because they take a level of skill to use. The worst part about this gun is they're SO common. Yet Epic thinks it's a good idea to add legendary shotguns that *can't* one shot. I can't even begin to describe how cockblocked I feel when I get someone extremely low and get one pumped, because they have a pump. A tactical shotgun, I wpuld understand because it wouldn't instant kill me if I had shield, the pump would still melt me.

How I propose we fix this: Remove headshot multipliers, if not reduce them. The gun does a good amount of damage to the body, which some would argue is too much, but it still gives you a chance at winning a fight. Shields exist to protect the player, thats why they're kind of hard to find, but you completely ignore the purpose of them if you have a gun that doesn't give two f***s about them.

WTF epic?

Please stop adding stuff and start to polish what you have!  OP shotguns so they add a new one?  WTF!  If something doesn't change me and my small friend group will play something else.  A game this competitive (they are trying to set up pros) can not survive let alone thrive having glitches in every single facet of the game!  

Also while on the topic please stop trying to make it a competitive game for pros. The whole appeal is anyone can play yet they are adjusting it for the try hard streamers first and foremost.  GTFO epic why don't you read between the lines?

-The map is roughly the size of the map from December. 

-You can not pick which map you play on. However all challenges have been altered to include locations on both maps. For example, if you need to get three kills at junk junction (map A) you can also get them at Scrap Skyscraper (map B). 

Challenges based on secret locations are still map specific however. Just gotta keep playing to get that one. 



Some location ideas of mine: 


#Magma Mountain: 
A volcano. It contains lava that when stepped in can cause 10 damage per second. Wood also burns near lava. 

^^Alternate names:
Violent Volcano


#Metro Mall: 
One massive 10 story mall filled with plenty of stores, chests, and what you'd expect. Basically the tilted towers of this map. 


#Campus Crossing: 
A small college town. Has a library, science lab, classrooms, a frat house, a gym, and a few other areas. 


#Area 69: 
A small bunker with a massive interior underground. Lots of testing goes on here, but look out, it comes with preinstalled traps harmful to all players. Likewise, it has a special escape launch-pad system as well to keep players from becoming trapped underground to the storm. 

^^Alternate names: 
Lunatic Labs


#Troubled Tracks: 
A rail line arround the map. The train moves on its own from station to station and contains its own loot in each car. The train its self will kill players and destroy buildings it runs into. The train can be destroyed. If one destroys the main engine, it will stop moving. If you destroy a car, the cars behind it will stop and get smashed if/when the train comes back around. In some games the second to last car will come equipped with a launch pad or permanent cozy campfire. 


#Perilous Park: 
  An amusement park with several cool attractions: A drop tower, faris wheel, roller coaster, bumper cars, etc. 

^^Alternate names: 
Abandoned Amusement

#Foul Fortress: 
A large wall/fort connecting two mountain peaks. Plenty of loot, archer locations, and traps preinstalled. 

^^Alternate names:
Demented Dam


#Duel Dungeon: 
Effectively a hidden dungeon with no loot, you heard me. No loot. The only thing is, guaranteed in the main chamber is two pistols meant for a duel. What pistol each is will be random. Once someone is killed in this area, a door will open revealing anywhere from 1-4 chests for whomever wants them. 


#Crazy Clock: 
Inspired from the infamous super Mario 64 map, this giant clock tower will allow players to navigate it's interior. What time of day it is (in-game) will depict the position of the gears and their speed. Getting crushed will kill you obviously. 


# Rough Rapids: 
Like Loot lake, but more like a set of rivers with a lodge at either end, leading to a waterfall. 



These are just some ideas I had, I'd love to hear your own. 

#Edit: Some suggested ideas from different users: 

# u/gthatch2 :

#Crazy Cove: 
up against the edge of the island...essentially a massive under ground cave with a few holes in the ground floor of the normal level for entrance and exit (one ramp style entrance from for non building access). A large ship or two just off the island right outside the mouth of the cave. Loot found both on the ships and in the cave.

#Neglected Neighborhood.
a neighborhood similar to pleasant park, but lose the park in the middle. At least a 4x3 grid of standard houses with a road in between each row, and maybe a larger mansion at the end of the road. Max size of a standard house is 2 stories (including attic or basement) and a garage. Most are 1 story though.....imagine the rooftop fights in this place.

^^Alternate names: 
Choke Couldesac

#Basic Base:
a military base. Nothing real special just a barracks and a hanger. Few small buildings. Plenty of tanks/jets/jeeps for collecting metal.

^^Alternate names:
Bold Base

#Majestic Museum:
My (his) personal favorite. It's a smaller (tomato town sized) museum complete with kiosks and a small gift shop. ...get this...things shown in the museum= old things removed from the game/things only in stw (electric trap showcase, zombies manikins, two double pump statues, etc).

^^Alternate names:
Nostalgia Nook



# u/BGinjur

#Treacherous Tundra:

A Snowy icy section roughly 6-8 squares in size that consists of mountainous terrain that can only be crossed in many areas by building bridges or taking long routes around. There could be small caves in the larger crevices with loot but would require decent building technique to access. This area would have mostly large rocks for materials and sage brush type bushes with a few ""Beacons of the Minas Tirith"" type structures on opposite corners of the Tundra.

You don't even see streamers picking up RPG's anymore because they just aren't a fun weapon to use.  They require zero skill (unlike the grenade launcher which at-least requires some aim). This is a poorly designed weapon and needs to be reworked.

The truth is if you're ever in the situation where you got one-shotted by a pump, you got outplayed. You could have out-builded your opponent, gotten high ground and turned that situation around. You could have been the one to take out your shotgun and get your headshot, but you missed (or if you didn't have a shotgun you shouldn't have been close-range in the first place - again, build to your advantage. No mats? Farm, don't fight).

Okay sure sometimes you're caught out and not specifically looking for fights and they happen. Again, this is not a problem with the shotgun, you weren't safe enough and put yourself in a risky situation. Sometimes its entirely not your fault and you just get surprised. Although if this happens by a shotgun you definitely weren't 100% alert.

It's okay to get outplayed. It's okay to get caught. These are things you can improve on. 

Sure, they shouldn't do 70 dmg from 10 meters away. They shouldn't do 7 headshot dmg from close. These are things that can be fixed. But I wouldn't call for the removal of something so integral to the game.

Between their potential to do absurd amounts of damage, their blatant inconsistency, and their effect on the building meta, shotguns are the result of as many satisfying clips as they are individual frustrations. In this post, I hope to fully and clearly present a few points describing what I perceive to be the current issues with shotguns and offer some suggestions as to how they could start feeling healthier.  
I'm eager to have conversation on the topic and to hear what the rest of this community thinks. Thanks in advance for reading, a TL;DR will be provided below.  
  
**Absurd Damage**  
This first point is mainly aimed at the pump shotgun. Being the only weapon that can do over 200 damage in one shot aside from the bolt action sniper is a ridiculous statement on its own, and while it may make sense to down somebody that quickly when they're right in front of you, the small spread of the pump allows it to do that type of damage at ranges that can't help but feel maddening.  
*Scaling down the headshot damage ratio may help with this issue, although it leads me into my next point, which is:*  
  
**Inconsistency**  
How inconsistent shotguns can feel. While this is especially true for the Tactical shotgun, it can definitely apply to the pump as well. We've all hit an opponent for a sweet 9 damage love tap, only to be ""one shot"" at the same range right afterwards. Situations like this are simply un-fun, and I feel that this inconsistency can be attributed to the game's current general shooting system, which randomly fires bullets within the confines of your crosshairs. Larger crosshair areas like the one on the tactical shotgun result in less consistent damage output: two equally skilled players could be at the same range and fire at the same time aiming at the same body part and get different damage amounts because of it.  
*Fixing this is a bit more difficult, although I think a short term solution could be to decrease the base damage of the tactical shotgun but increase the accuracy.*  
  
**Effect on Building**  
A normal thing to see higher level players do is use aggressive building to get a height advantage in order to overwhelm their opponents. Because the quickest way to do that is using stairs, build fights naturally bring players into close quarters. Enter stage right, shotguns. There's simply no better weapon to use when you may only get one quick shot in between build battle sessions.  
*General nerfs like the ones listed above to make shotguns feel less versatile are probably the simplest answer here - imo build fights with a SMG feel much more rewarding because the difficulty of and pay off for headshots in comparison to shotties*  
  
**TL;DR**  
* 200+ damage in one shot is too much, scale down headshot ratio  
* Inconsistency due to general shooting system sucks, increase accuracy of tac shotty but lower base damage  
* Build fights result in close quarters, making shotguns shine even more. Nerf them to decrease versatility but increase consistency.  
  
All in all, I definitely believe there are simple ways to make them feel healthier than they do in their current state.  
Like I said before, I'm eager to discuss so let me know your thoughts and thanks again for reading!",FortNiteBR

The main difference between solo and duos/squads are the fact that you can play with your friends, and the capacity to be revived after you've been downed. 

Nowadays, a majority of times that I ever play, every player tends to kill off the knocked players(especially in the early game when some  players don't have weapons and mats). This of spoils the entire fun of playing with your friends when you either have to wait for your friends to finish the game, or they have to quit. 

Well if a lot of people agree with me, I think that a cap should be placed on the damage that can be done to a knocked player( around 60 I think).

This would give adequate time for a teammate to make a play to save his partner, but also shorten the lifespan of a knocked player to the extent where you can collect the resources of a knocked player within a couple of seconds if his/her teammates abondon her.

The OG fortnite players will remember that if a bug was reported that it was fixed in about a week(2 max) or they at least acknowledged the bug and their plans to fix it. Now ever since 3.0 and the introduction of all the bugs that came with it plus the ones before that never got patched, it feels like EPIC is just here for the money.

I would totally understand and even be excited if EPIC would take some time to stop focusing on pushing more content out for their game and fix the issues/bugs that are already here. They seem to be adding more bugs than they are fixing.

It says that my account has been locked due to multiple incorrect login attempts, however I was able to log into the client without any problems, therefore I believe this is a phishing email.

It however came from help@epicgames.com, the ""contact us"" sends email to accounts@unrealengine.com which I am not familiar with.

Few questions arise:

Is this phishing email?
How do they know my name?
How they got the the information?
Is this a real email, when someone tried to brute force my account, then how did they get my username?

Reading through some forums, I am not the only one experiencing this recently:

The below are trivial changes and would make a huge difference:

* Let us remove &amp; re-order the building items. This alone would make a huge difference.
* Allow us to set a different sensitivity when building

I think it would be a good idea to give community feedback here as to why something should go for a while.

Here are my suggestions:

Silenced weapons: They don't serve a good role as of now. We already have two SMG lines, and the hand cannon can already cover fr the pistol when it comes to epic/legendary sidearms. Stealth with them also isn't very viable, as they do too little damage, with the real problem being directional indicators saying where the player was hit from.

Pump: With a new shotgun being added it would be wise to at least remove the green Pump. I think it's a fair trade for a legendary shotgun, and the white Pump isn't too bad for it's rarity.

Revolver: The thing is almost never used, and ever since it started using medium bullets it really lost it's potential for sidearm action. Placing it as blue rarity in the pistol line would help, as it was have a stream from light to heavy ammo.

Scoped AR: It's a good concept, and aims well, but with it's damage you'd really have to hammer your finger to get anyone with shields down before they can build a wall. I don't remember any auto mode on it, and with around 20 damage a shot it' really niche for people without even a crossbow lategame.

Crossbow: This one doesn't see much use either, and pollutes the pool even more since it only takes up the spot of a sniper. I think the hunting rifle does a good enough job at covering snipers for lower tiers.

These are just my opinions though, other people need to post theirs so hopefully when Epic vaults something or changes an item maybe they'll have some better community feedback before instead of outlash after.",FortNiteBR

The numbers of players dwindled down until it was just us vs the final DUO.     We were each fighting our respective opponents at the north end of loot lake when my roomate goes down to a seemingly endless supply of rockets. I manage to down my man and put him out when my roomate says, ""thats Ninja by the way"".   I thought to myself ""oh ninja? No big deal""   I hadn't had butterflies in my stomach like this since my first solo win back in the day.    He proceeds to build on top of me and I lay platforms above my head as I run east. I guess he got cocky and jumped right in front of me hoping for an easy kill but I had my green pump cocked and ready, put it in his mouth the second he jumped down then pulled the trigger which released a cloud of Ninja loot and completed my personal greatest feat in the entire game of Fortnite.

No doubt Ninja is a better player than I am but holy.... I did it!!!

Thanks epic, for making a GREAT Multiplayer game this accessible and fun. You guys are the best!

Things happens, but cmon, I know people aren’t actually discussing getting rid of the pump.

3,ZhuGeLiang,1553783121,b6jfc3,80,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b6jfc3/whats_up_with_the_bus_fare_rules_in_arena/,238,What's up with the bus fare rules in Arena?,"Here's what we know:

* Open League: no bus fare (Divisions 1-3)
* In Duos, Contenders: -1 (Division 4), -2 (Division 5), -3 (Division 6), Champions: -4 (Division 7)
* In Solos, bus fare is -1 in Contenders 4 and 5, and -2 in Contenders 6.
* It also appears that points are shared between solo and duos.

During the Gauntlet test cups, we saw how -2 bus fare ensured no point inflation in the playerbase, because the amount of points given out in a game (+207 minus suicides/storm deaths although this may be smaller now due to kill credit being given 
to the last player who damaged you) is roughly equal to the amount of points being taken away (-200). This establishes an effective ranking system, although different from MMR. A player ranks up to the point where they struggle to earn 2 points, and stays at that equilibrium level, until they actually improve and float higher. You can't really game this system and by being matched with similar point players you can reliably judge how good you are.
* [The simple, yet very effective theory behind the bus fare in the new point system and why it is -2.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/axy7od/the_simple_yet_very_effective_theory_behind_the/)
* [Bus fare rewards consistency](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ay0n9j/i_have_59_points_but_only_twenty_due_to_bus_fare/)


In Arena, bus fare is not consistently applied. Open is free, which means bad players can grind their way to Contender 1 just with time, and even at Contender 1, more points are given out than taken away.


This means Open isn't a true ranked mode - it's simply a time gate! And neither is Contenders 4 (duos) and 4-5 (solos). Only when you reach Contenders 5 (duos) and 6 (solos) does the system become an effective skill ladder.

And even then, there's also other inconsistencies that make even Contenders not a ""true ranked ladder"" the way Gauntlet is:
* Inconsistency between solo and duo bus fares. Solos stays at -1 for Contender 5, while it bumps up to -2 for duos. 
* Your points carry over between solos and duos.


This means you can effectively game this system to get into Contender 6 duos by playing Contender 5 solos, where the bus fare is lower.

This also means that any kind of leaderboards won't be meaningful until Contender 6 or Champions 7, since players can get to the same score risking different amounts of points - some by their true skill, others by grinding solos for net gains over time in order to place higher for duos.



The only reason I can think of for this system is that Epic does not want people to stay at 0 because it feels bad. By inflating players to Division 4 (Contender) for free before beginning to subtract points, your starting rank is a positive number, and instead of being floored at 0, players are floored at Contender 4. This is okay in theory since we've simply raised the ""floor"". 


But once you reach Contender 4 as the ""floor"" of the ladder, bus fare should really be a flat -2 across all divisions.


The only offsetting effect to inflation here is the fact that Champions 7 has a bus fare of -4. This takes points out of the system from the highest players (every game they play they risk 400 points for +207 reward). But this can also be gamed, especially if the goal is to stay in Champions for World Cup qualifiers. Someone on the cusp of Champions 7 who's not *as amazing* as other Champions, but wants to qualify for the World Cup, would be better off playing until they barely make it into Champions 7 and then not touching Arena again!


Would love to hear everyone's thoughts on this!


tl;dr there are some inconsistencies with the Arena bus fare system that result in Divisions not being a true ranked ladder. The system is open to some ""gaming"" since bus fare is inconsistently applied between divisions, and points carry over between solos and duos.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

Before we start, a quick disclaimer, I'm by no means a PC expert, these are just some things I have done after doing some research. If you do decide to follow some of these steps, you do so at your own risk.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, here is my spec:

&amp;#x200B;

CPU - Ryzen 5 2600

GPU - RX 580 8GB

RAM - 2x8gb DDR4 3000Mhz

SSD - Samsung 860 evo 500gb

Motherboard - MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is not the most amazing setup, but with this I am getting a consistent 144fps capped (uncapped usually over 200) during the entire early/mid game, and with stacked end games (25+ moving) it's usually around 80-120. I bought the entire setup about two months ago and it cost me approx. £1000, including a 144hz monitor &amp; peripherals. (should be a similar price in USD).

&amp;#x200B;

I would recommend doing a fresh install of Windows 10 to fully optimise.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are steps I have taken to get the most out of my PC:

&amp;#x200B;

1: Debloat Windows 10. As standard, Windows 10 comes with a tonne of crap you don't need on your PC, often things that run in the background, and just generally make your PC sluggish. There is a script you can run to remove all the crap. [Here is the video guide I used.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4ziE5Am0pM) 

&amp;#x200B;

2: Optimise Windows 10 settings. This is mostly going through all of your windows settings and disabling pretty much everything. There are a lot of settings on by default (particularly in the privacy and gaming sections) which don't need to be on. Also disable any power saving options. To be honest this probably has minimal effect, but every little helps. There are plenty of youtube guides if you search ""windows 10 optimization"". Some of these guides involve regedit's which can be risky, I followed some of them without issue, but you should create backup points just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

3: Have Fortnite installed on an SSD. This won't have too much effect on in game performance, but the game will load up much quicker when loading from an SSD which is always nice.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Overclock your CPU. The 2600 is 3.4 Ghz by default, I have mine overclocked to 4 Ghz with stock cooler. I have seen some people get as high as 4.2 with better cooling systems. Overclocking is NOT hard or particularly dangerous. Again, there are plenty of overclocking guides on youtube, search for a guide on overclocking via your motherboards BIOS.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Overclock your GPU. Personally I haven't been able to do this successfully (I didn't win the silicon lottery), but you should be able to get around 10% performance increase from your GPU by overclocking, perhaps more if you're lucky. Again, go on to youtube and search for an overclocking guide for your GPU. I recommend MSI Afterburner.

&amp;#x200B;

6. Overclock your RAM. This can be done in the BIOS, similar to how you do CPU. I overclocked mine from 3000 to 3200. Only a small increase but like I said, every little helps.

&amp;#x200B;

7. Optimise your GPU settings. This can be done in AMD Radeon settings, or the Nvidia Control Panel. There are a few settings you want to ensure are turned off. [This is the guide I used for AMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz5kTs8rDfk), I'm sure there are also guides for Nvidia.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Make sure your CPU is being fully utilised. This step is thanks to u/Snufffyyy who posted [his guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b5tat1/smoother_gameplay_on_multithreaded_cpus/) a few days ago.

&amp;#x200B;

9. Stretched Res &amp; In game settings. Play on fullscreen. Use [this tool](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU) for stretched, it's much easier than other methods. I use 1279x1080. Obviously you want all in game settings low (view distance optional), vsync and motion blur off etc. View distance can be set to low if you really want as many frames as possible - it doesn't have any impact on the distance which you see players.

&amp;#x200B;

10. If you have a 144hz monitor, make sure you are using 144hz! Most 144hz monitors are set at 60 by default. To check go to display settings &gt; advanced display settings &gt; display adapter properties &gt; monitor &gt; screen refresh rate. Also make sure you have mouse acceleration disabled, Fortnite apparently does this by default, but its worth doing just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

11. Don't have anything running in the background. Things like spotify, chrome etc. Chrome in particular eats a lot of CPU power and can be taking away from Fortnites performance. Also check your startup apps, a lot of apps start when you turn your pc on and just run in the background. Disable as many of these as you can. If you must have something running, for example discord, go in your settings for that app and disable hardware acceleration (Its under Appearance in discord settings).

&amp;#x200B;

12. Use a wired connection, seriously, wifi just doesn't cut it. If you're in a different room to your router, use a powerline adaptor.

&amp;#x200B;

13. Use freesync or g-sync, if your monitor allows. Having this enabled gives you a much smoother experience.

&amp;#x200B;

14. Run [CCleaner](https://www.ccleaner.com/). The free version works fine, just a tool to remove any unnecessary files etc that could be clogging up your PC.

&amp;#x200B;

15. Install unreal engine via the epic games launcher. Supposedly having this installed helps Fortnite run a little smoother. I haven't tested this yet, but it may help.

&amp;#x200B;

16. Give Fortnite priority. While Fortnite is running, go to task manager &gt; details &gt; right click FortniteClient-Win64-Shipping.exe and set prioerity to high. You will need to be logged in as Admin to be able to change this setting.

&amp;#x200B;

That is about all I can think of for now! If I remember anything else I'll come back and add it to the list. Hopefully some of these steps may help some of you see an increase. And to all you console players, I'm sorry, I used PS4 from season 1-7 and I just couldn't handle it any longer. If you are on the fence about changing, and can afford to do so, 100% do it ASAP!",FortniteCompetitive

The game no longer feels smooth like it once did (I’m stretched and capped at 144 fps with a 1070 ti and a ryzen 5 1600x with all low settings) 

Epic needs to stop adding new things in, I don’t care if it’s just a trap that was added in, clearly more things do not need to be added if the current games state is unhealthy, what do they not understand? Why do they not get this? The more and more that’s coded in the more and more stuff that is destined for problems. It’s clear that Epic doesn’t test the items they create for the game. We waited so long for this patch for practically nothing but audio to be turned down, game performance to get “less” hitches (they’re still happening) we did get a ranked mode (blessed for, it still needs WORK) 

Shotguns dont shoot/ still have blank hit markers 
Building is awful, it’s not smooth, there is terrible delay, same goes with editing
People phase through every build as if it never existed in the first place 

At this point in the game, and I’m super reliant on shotguns (as are most people) afraid to take a shotgun battle because I know something stupid is going to happen and I’ll hit them for a 40 and get smacked for 120 or my shotgun will decide it’s not gonna shoot. I believe this is just ruining mine and other people’s confidence when it comes down to gameplay, If I always feel like something bad is going to happen, that’s what’ll happen. 

Epic please please please stop adding things to this game, it doesn’t need it. Stop lying to us with what you’re doing and fix this game, I would be fine if they didn’t add anything in for months if it meant to actually fix the current game state because it’s at an ALL TIME LOW.

**Here are some misinformed statements:**

*1) “eventually you will get placed against people with the same skill level and hardware disadvantages, it will be fair.”*

Wrong. Same points does NOT equal same skill. There are way too many variables that come into play with the point system and the way matches play out, it is not this black and white. Plus, even if it was true and i was facing off against someone with the exact same mechanical skill and game sense, he can have 144fps, custom res, and no shadows, along with significantly better performance late game. (Even if the pc player has the same fps and performance, the far superior input method, no shadows, and custom res goes a long way)

*2) “separating lobbies will just make que times awful for everyone”*

Nope. Everyone in the world could be playing ranked 24/7, and there would still eventually be a point threshold that only a small percentage of players can hit, and there will still be high que times because of it. This isnt a player base issue, its a percentage of the best players issue. Also, i assure you, there is a very, very, small percentage of console players even capable of hitting point values where que times become an issue, so no, console players being in pc lobbies does not help you. 

*3) “if facing pc players is too much for you, comp isnt for you and you should play pubs”*

Uh what? Look we are not asking for console prize pools or invitationals to the world cup. Theres a reason zero console players are in the pro scene, and the small amount of controller players who are are on high end pcs. Theres a huge pool of above average to very good console players who enjoy the syphon rules and playing competitively, but will never be able to compete against pc and their advantages when in the upper echelon of the skill ceiling. We just want to be able to enjoy comp on a level playing field. This game is not casual pub player, pro pc comp player, or nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

First of all, what is gonna happen when we get a lot of points in arena mode? Long queue times, super mega sweaty tryhards, how is that fun?

Ranked should be an option when a player wants to go against tough opponents and pubs should be for fun. I wanna do both, but pubs are not fun at all. Just played some normal solos and is terrible. There is tryhards in solos, I'm laughing that Epic thinks that all tryhards will play in arena. Of course fucking not. Its obvious. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just played a bunch of solo games, getting third partied is worse, and fighting enemies is not rewarding anymore, I kill them, and lost health and mats in the progress just got a third partier to come and kill me easily because there is no reward in killing players anymore?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't understand how people can defend this change. I have friends that want to do squads, we played, we all got off after a couple of games because farming for long times is just dogshit. Now if we wanna do squads we gotta play on the old terrible mechanics, seriously Epic?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm disappointed and really want to uninstall the game. Yea, we asked for ranked, we wanted it because sometimes we want to play against tough players, but other times we want to have fun and play pubs.

This is a bit long winded but if you want hot takes with no nuance go to Twitter not Reddit 😊 - you can also follow most of the logic by just reading the bold sections. Here we go:

&amp;#x200B;

This decision by Epic all revolves around INCENTIVES (like most of life!), both incentives for Epic Games and incentives for the various types of Fortnite players.

&amp;#x200B;

First to Epic. Epic’s goal is to make oodles of money through Fortnite – this is the bread and butter of free market capitalism – it can bring negatives when it comes to actual monetization, but overall this makes a large part of Fortnite’s end goal to **MAKE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE AS ADDICTED AS POSSIBLE TO FORTNITE**. That is always their incentive. This aligns their incentive pretty with your personal Fornite enjoyment EXCEPT if your enjoyment is harming the enjoyment of another more important or larger player base (more on that later).

So if you are Epic, **how do you make Fortnite INCREDIBLY ADDICTING** so that everyone who wants to boot up a game chooses Fortnite? There are tons of answers that fall into three categories – two of which everyone on Fortnite reddit wants to hear, one they don’t! You can almost think of these as drugs (they function like them in our brain).

**Category 1: unique gameplay experience, optimized performance, no bugs, perfectly balanced loot pool, perfect mix of new items and vaults, high quality of life, low frustration, social interaction w/ friends**

**Category 2: Provide the “drug” of IMPROVEMENT to the player (increased skill) when they play**

**Category 3: Provide the “drug” of SUCCESS to the player (kills and wins) when they play**

&amp;#x200B;

Category 1 answers are universal across the player base – individuals may have their unique opinions on how you make it happen based on their skill and preferences, but on the whole they will be generally similar across the board. The siphon, mats per kill, and harvesting rate all fall in this bucket. On the surface without looking at the larger ramifications most players, casual and competitive, would say they would like to farm less, always have health, be rewarded for a kill, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to Category 2 and Category 3. What most people on Reddit / Youtube / Twitch don’t fully appreciate is that 95%+ of gamers want Category 3 &gt; Category 2. They may not even acknowledge it consciously themselves, but no one keeps playing a game without success (the level of acceptable success differs by player). Casuals first and foremost, but even you (YES YOU!) reading this post. Think about it – isn’t there a bare minimum level of success below which you wouldn’t play Fortnite? If you had a 0.25KD and 0 wins this season after playing significant hours (no offense to anyone out there!) would you keep playing? I would not.

&amp;#x200B;

I am about to get real radical here… but I’d argue Category 3 is also as important or even more important than even Category 1! As proof… how many of us are still playing Fortnite around the clock even though almost every single post on reddit is complaining about serious Category 1 issues? Yes there are other reasons (Fornite is a unique genre, even though we complain there is still a lot of good, etc.) – but a big reason is that you are GOOD at the game and love the SUCCESS when you play (again, we all have different levels of expected / acceptable success).

&amp;#x200B;

After being out 1.5 years Fortnite has a growing player SUCCESS problem ”Category 3”. As the player base gets better there is a larger and larger skill gap. This has increased continually the last 1.5 years and will happen until Fortnite dies. Epic can’t stop it even if they tinker with trying to slow it down from time to time. As the skill gap gets larger the SUCCESS moments of “casuals” occurs less often and is of lesser degree. Also as the skill gap increases, more and more people fall into this “casual” bucket and ultimately meet their tipping point where they no longer get enough SUCCESS so they lose desire to play. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How does Epic fix this? – by providing easier SUCCESS to players so they have higher moments of success and are successful more often. In a game with only 1 winner and only 100 kills to go around this is tough to accomplish. What is the best way to give less skilled players success without ruining the game experience for skilled players? GET THE SKILLED PLAYERS AWAY FROM THE NON SKILLED PLAYERS. FAR AWAY.**

&amp;#x200B;

**How do you do this? – by either (1) forcing mandatory skill based matchmaking on all players or (2) setting up the incentives so that skilled players willfully choose to play against other skilled players.** \#1 has proven to be a failing strategy in the gaming industry (this post is already too long so we won’t go there). To accomplish #2 Epic first has tried only using positive incentives by introducing Pop Up / Gauntlet. They have now taken that a step further by setting up permanent ranked and providing massive incentives to do well through the payouts, etc. So, they have attempted to give skilled players what they want so they willingly choose it over stomping away the SUCCESS of casuals. However, Epic has determined that this isn’t enough and that they believe there are still too many skilled players in the regular modes ruining the SUCCESS of non skilled players (thus losing Epic money). So now **Epic is taking the manipulation of incentives a step further and have decided that EVEN if it costs some “Category 1” enjoyment for everyone (even casuals!) they must provide negative incentives to keep skilled players away from casuals. Reverted siphon / mats will increase SUCCESS of non skilled players by making it less appealing for skilled players to play pubs** and to a lesser extent by reverting a feature that tended to benefit the more skilled player in game.

&amp;#x200B;

**Final statement: While 95% of reddit will make you think otherwise, Epic Games is not full of idiots. They have the most successful game ever. They also aren't deaf. They know the vast majority of those on Reddit / Youtube / Twitch liked siphon and the mat buffs. They have weighed the pros and cons and believe making you angry about pubs (Reddit / Youtube / Twitch) is worth the trade off of pushing more and more skilled players to Arena. Saying ""This Sucks! Everyone likes siphon / mats"" is fine if you just want to voice your displeasure, but it is completely missing the rationale of the change.** ",FortniteCompetitive

**Beginner/Ultimate Casual**
This is like your younger brother who plays mainly plays big team LTMs with like a KD of 0.2, basically a beginner which there's obviously nothing wrong with that. Possibly the average player considering the playerbase as a whole. This update is good for them as it pushes better players away from the core gamemodes.

**Above Average but not ""Competitive""**
As the title says, above average player who can drop a decent amount of kills per match, with a KD of maybe like 2-3. Someone who plays a lot with their friends and possibly pubstomp. But not a competitive player who is into scrimming etc. This type of player probably dislikes the new patch as they're left with no in-between.

**True Competitive Player/Pro/Wannabe Pro**
This update is great for them since they have a permanent ranked mode and probably don't care about pubs. e.g. Mongraal 

This is just my take on what's going on. I'd probably be in the 2nd category since I don't have time to invest into playing scrims etc and mainly play squads with friends who are also in the same situation as me. What do you guys think?

I don't know the numbers of how many ""casual"" players vs people who actually play the game is, however, why direct a game towards the players that inconsistently play? I've seen posts arguing that the game had too much of a competitive aspect and ""sweats"" (which in my mind is absolutely ridiculous, who plays a game to lose?) but isn't taking away health on kills going to make it more difficult for the players who are bad? I couldn't name the amount of times I have been killed by a bad player through a bug, glitch or lag let alone a lucky one pump. If we have 10 people land Salty, most likely the players who are good are going to outplay the bad players whether they have the health on kill or not. However, if a bad player lands and gets a good pump for the health wouldn't that enable them to have more of an advantage? I understand you could argue vice versa, however, if you give less of an opportunity for health to someone who is good, it would essentially be easier for them to kill the bot especially with good macro/micro play? Pots are commonly found so you couldn't even argue that the health puts a bad player at a greater disadvantage. Third, fourth and fifth partying is going to be an issue even more than it was before this update. My friends and I W key people more knowing that they most likely don't have shield or because they most likely won't hit shots and build the way we do. This game has been extremely inconsistent when it came to helping players understand how to play the game. For a long time the game gave the ideology that you could sit in a 1x1 and camp till the end of the game. That is the main reason ""casuals"" stay casual. The interpretation of casual gameplay is someone who isn't good nor wants to get good so therefore they consider themselves a casual. If a ""casual"" player play every day for a couple hours, they aren't casual, they're bad. Who plays a game, sport or anything in between to not get better? It's the same concept of going to school and not studying, failing everything and then having the ability to go to the next grade. Nowadays a kid could play a sport, be absolutely horrendous and be rewarded a participation trophy? False gratification. The casuals who are going to camp and farm all game until last circle are going to think the game is ""better"" because they made it to top 10 or top 5 or top 3 but get brutally destroyed by the last 2 teams because those teams took the time to get decent at the game. Then what? They're going to be proud of getting top 3? They'll continue to not improve and eventually quit because they can't win anyways. I'm going to continue to W key people early game the same way anyone else is that has a brain. Every game i had this morning had 30 people left in first circle; nothing has changed besides the fact that the game took 2 steps backwards. Yes, we finally got ranked; long overdue. However, what happens in a week or so when the points are high and the above average players have to wait in a queue time of 10 minutes lol? There isn't even a squad mode so you can't even play a ranked with your squad you've been playing with religiously for months. Ranked is great and all and it's completely understanding that once good players are in a lobby it becomes a turtle session, however, that gets boring. Day in and day out you'll be playing ranked because pubs is ruined to sit there and be miserable 99% of the game time; you won't get a break from the dreariness. The previous patch promoted too much aggressive gameplay? It's a PvP based game, it's meant for killing. Eventually all content creators are going to move on because the ability to have good content is going to be too difficult. People aren't going to want to watch slow gameplay let alone a queue time long enough for me to go take a shower and come back. If Epic wanted to make a game mode for a ""Casual"" player who doesn't want to excel or become better they should have made a quickplay version for squads only. With this mode ""casual"" players will have the ability to play the way they want to and it'll have less aggressiveness because all the people that put an hour in a day who can manage to have the below average hand-coordination to build a 14 minute 90 can still play pubs. If they are a casual player they shouldn't deserve a dedicated solos/duo version. You can't sit there and put an update in that saved a game (the health and mats) and call it a test. That blows my mind, make a PBE if you want to test something. With a community this engaging and involved, epic should release community polls so they don't completely crap on the game and could at least see what's coming before they let an update out and everyone starts complaining about it. There are so many bugs that still sit within this game that could help out the casual player; blank hitmarkers, shots through turbo building, turbo building delay, phasing, swapping a gun when you have open slots, PUMPS NOT SHOOTING? The noobs that complain how they don't have the ability to get better because of ""pub stompers"" are simple-minded because they're going to be farming all game and camping until last circle when they get killed anyways lol. How does that give the ability to get better? An expert isn't an expert until they achieve 10k hours of said field. So with the lack of fighting in a game that is based solely on fighting, how does one become better if you diminish the main objective of the game?",FortniteCompetitive

During the end-games of stacked endgames, players on console where frame rate is already capped at 60 FPS can drop to as low as 10 FPS during fights, with also losing the ability to shoot and build.

This significantly reduces the possibility of console players (not controller, talking about controller on console and mouse/keyboard in console) getting high places and being in the running for winning prize money. IT sometimes feels unfair that you sometimes have to pay in excess of $1000 to be able to run decent endgames.

I don't care if casual Joe disagrees with me, there are many casuals out there who almost quit this game because of health on kill.  I know this because my brothers are two of the casuals that almost quit due to health on kill.  Yes the material nerf was dumb, but the health on kill nerf was necessary for the regular game modes.

Pub stompers were able to carry extra guns/equipment in their loadout because they knew they could stomp through people and recoup the &lt;50 health they lose per battle when they kill someone.  The average casual player who gets 1-3 kills per game loses over 100 HP per battle and still has to use two loadout slots to carry shields/health.  Huge disadvantage for the player already at a disadvantage skill wise.  Also, the player who doesn't get a ton of kills is relying solely on RNG to get the shield early game to get them to 200 HP when a pub stomper is cruising through the lobby constantly running 200 HP.  

They have arena mode for the people that want all of the things they reverted.  Go play that.  Do you think its a coincidence they took out the health per kill in regulars when they release arena?? No.  They want as many people as possible to be filtering into the arena game mode.  

To the people who don't want to ""sweat"" to get the health per kill.  If they revert this change back where does that leave the casuals??  The ignorance of some of the pros/streamers that cannot see this is mind blowing.  I get that you want this game to cater to your every need and want, but take off your competitive glasses off and think about the less skilled players who want to enjoy this game the same way you do.  There are thousands out there that feel this way that just don't post their opinions to social media.

Clearly, when you get health per kill, the good players get better and the bad players get worse.  That was an obvious observation I noticed right from the start.  Now, to keep that implemented for months and to get players used to that play style, then just revert it?  Sounds like piss poor foreshadowing... but that's the motto for the Fortnite Dev Team.  They've always had piss poor future vision of this game.  So now it's back to the old fortnite. Farm for 20 minutes, die to random RNG.  A bad player with a purple pump can ruin your game.

I imagine for the casuals, the health on kill reverting is probably a good idea. I can't really understand the harvesting and mat cap going back and how that will impact them positively, but the health on kill nerf possibly isn't the worst idea (for casuals). So yes, the upside of the update is that more of the skilled players will move to the arena mode, and the competitive games will be more competitive (I hope). I have 2 main issues with this however.

&amp;#x200B;

**Forced into Arena**

I love the popup cups, gauntlets etc, but I don't want to play them 24/7. After many hours of competitive playing my brain is fried, and just want to relax and play some pubs. Now, that option is basically gone as these public matches will be so dull. I play a lot of creative at the moment (Turtle wars and moving zones mainly) and I see my time in these increasing. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Console Players**

I play PC, but I feel really bad for console players now. Their only option to play with essentially fun settings, is to play the arena mode, which is obviously mixed platform. With the current state of console performance, being forced to play against PC players is a wack. I would again say this would be fine if they could at least figure out a way to fix console performance, but that isn't looking likely at this stage.",FortniteCompetitive

Removing pop up rules in pubs is fine since we now have a form of SBMM (obviously it’s not the best SBMM but it’ll generally put you with other top players that are q’ing). The new trap is the only thing I’d like to see more about and make an educated decision on. 

Just a side note, I do agree with removing pop up rules in pubs regardless because it was really unfair and skewed towards comp players. Not saying I didn’t personally enjoy it, but it’s actually a bad business move from EPIC to keep the mechanic in the game. Most players, according to us, are bad players who we shit on. If we shit on casuals more and more, exacerbated by hp on kill, they are less likely to come back and buy skins.

I’d suggest to quit latching on to the minority of questionable components of the update, with World’s coming soon I think worrying about smaller things isn’t worth it.",FortniteCompetitive

I said that I just didn't have fun playing anymore and I was thinking about just quitting the game entirely, even as a player who has played the game for over a year and played competitively for a while now. I've finally made my decision that I will be quitting the game entirely. I just don't feel that the game is in a good spot anymore and there is just nothing fun about the game. I've lost all of my motivation not just because of the state of the game, but because of me. I felt like fortnite wasn't the game for me to grind anymore and I just kept getting frustrated over a lot of things that are in the game rn. 

So I will thank reddit for giving a bit of motivation to keep moving forward and improving but I don't feel like this game is for me anymore so I am fully and permanently quitting the game. Fortnite is that one game that is holding me back from going pro in gaming one day, I will still be playing games like csgo and quake champions, but I just can't stand the game anymore. I am going to wait for another competitive game to take gaming by storm but until then, I'm gonna' play other games that I like and stream here and there. I am currently 14 right now and I have been playing fps and other shooter/competitive games since I was 5  games like counter strike, unreal tournament 2004 (only cool kids played that btw :), and battlefield. I felt like fortnite could become an opportunity for me to prove myself as a competitive player, possibly even pro, but why would I ever move forward when i'm trying to improve at something that I don't even enjoy doing one bit. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently right now I'm going to start a CS:GO team for me and a few other players to improve together and play competitively, If you have a friend that is currently interested to find a csgo team or wan't to join my discord server just to chat please message me for an invite at Throizon #5439

In conclusion, fortnite is not the game for me anymore and I am fully going to quit, this is the end :(

My problem is early game, no joke it will take me 8 to 10 games to make it out of spawn. My initial solution was to start landing on pumps rather than to go for chests, this did not help because in my case these pumps spawn in horrible positions and will have me lasered to death before I even get within shotgun range or get to farm, if I do not land on a pump I will kill people in spawn until I run into someone who has guess what? Thats right, a pump. If I have mats shield and any pump I will have the time of my life playing this game, it just frustrates me that it takes so long to get to that point because I have to die 10 times in a row first. The very only place I can make it out of spawn consistently is tilted towers because there is so much chaos going on which makes up for my shitty rng and all the buildings make up for the lack of mats, any other place that is contested by more than 2 people I will die in spawn over and over.

All this goes for pubs, since I land uncontested in scrims and am much quicker to completely disengage than in pubs.
U dont have to tell me to start landing uncontested in pubs since Id like to learn how to improve in these situations, not avoid them. Except for that playing really safe in tournaments and scrims all the time Id love to just mindlessly  w-key every now and then dont you agree?😄

We can do better by understanding the history of creative 1v1s, why they're played like they're played, and removing the stigma on knocking builds down.

Back in season 3, scrims were just starting to be a thing, and players weren't really using cones yet. Only a very small amount of people had build-fight experience, and a smaller amount of people were doing dedicated practice with each other. Jaomock and Tennp0 were setting up 1v1s in 20v20v20v20v20 maps, getting a loadout, going to moisty mire, fighting, and the leaving the game and doing it again. It was, unfortunately, the best way to practice.

At the time, we were trying to figure out the best way to practice. How far away should we start? How do we make sure we both start at the same time? At the time, the meta was to start ~5 blocks away from each other with 1 offset, that way the ramps would build past each other. Fully built, it looked like [this](https://i.imgur.com/JKeR6yR.jpg).

Then, when the players crossed, anything went. Some people tried to jump over and get a cheeky pump off. Some players expected that, and would wall between the ramps and go for height. Some players would bait that wall and knock both builds down. Some players didn't build the last ramp, and instead shot the other player out. There were a lot of different openers, and all of them were fair. We used a third friend in discord to count us off so that we both started at the same time.

Build fights progressed much like how they did in season 3. No one was good at retakes or 90s, so it was mostly a race to get initial high ground, followed by shooting someone else out if they tried to ramp tunnel up. In turn, you'd have to bait the shoot out, and then ramp tunnel the other way to get high ground. Or, you could threaten a knock down and then try to take height, or do an actual knockdown, and then take height.

Later, playground mode was released. The day that happened, the liquid boys got a *ton* of clout because they were *way* better than everyone else at build fighting, especially Tom and Chap.

They also started their fights differently. Rather than doing the 3 ramps away thing, they started right next to each other like [this](https://imgur.com/72p3A73). They'd make sure their backs were against the small back wall (so that they'd start at equal positions), and then they'd have a friend count them down in discord.

At the time, the meta was fresh, so some people were doing 180s almost immediately, some people would go out 1 ramp, some would go out 2 ramps, etc. You could go out as far as you wanted, and turn however you wanted, but if you went out too far, that meant your build wasn't connected, and you could get shot out and lose height.

The different openers all had different advantages over each other. I remember poach almost never got initial height (vs tom), so rather than contesting it at all, he'd carry a tac SMG, pull it out right as he built the connecting ramp, and then spray out immediately when he got ramped over, allowing him to go through the ramp without really losing momentum. Tom gave poach endless shit, saying ""you're not going to find an smg every game"". This is right at the end of season 4, when double pump was still meta, and poach was an early smg adopter. Foot in mouth XD.

At any rate, tom adapted to poach's play, and poach had to figure other stuff out. The fights evolved like a fighting game does. Guesses, mindgames, counters, etc.

The broader community played with the liquid boys, and adopted their style of creative 1v1. The idea was that you *could* start further away, but the meta play was to just ramp push each other anyway, so why waste all that time/mats when you could just skip all of that.

Fast forward some time, and people are finally using cones in build fights, editing down on people, and understanding 90s. Around this time we also discovered the arch-edit-start, and that finally removed the need for people to either have a friend in discord count them down, or to communicate a in-game-clock time to start on, since neither of those was particularly reliable.

Once the arch-edit-start was meta, 90s were also meta, and so there were a couple of main opening strategies. You could ramp out 2 ramps away from the arch (initial ramp + 1), double 90, and then meet or you could ramp out 3 ramps away from the arch, (initial ramp + 2), double 90, and then meet.

Some people also started doing 3 ramps away, triple 90, extend it, triple 90 again, and then meet. As far as we could tell, this 6 90 strat got you height over 2 90s, and so a lot of people adopted that. The idea there is simple. 90s are faster height than ramping, so you want to do as many 90s as possible before you meet.

If you see your opponent getting height with his 6 90s vs your 2 90s, you can just crank 10 90s, to get height. If someone is betting you with 10 90s, you should do 14, and so on.

I'm certain that if someone tried to crank 6 90s against poach on day 1 playground release, he would have just shot down the initial ramp after his 180 start.

So, some things to keep in mind: going 3 ramps out and then cranking 90s without understanding what your opponent is doing is *very brittle* and *very weak to getting shot out*. People only get away with it because other people let them, or they have some weird house rule that disallows shoot-outs.

Getting height on someone, and then cranking 3-4 more 90s to guarantee height is brittle in the same way. It's a fine play if you predict that someone will mindlessly try to contest (but contesting height shouldn't be their only allowed play).

Knocking down builds is *part of build fighting* and disallowing it *makes you worse.*

For creative 1v1s, I suggest the [following start pattern](https://i.imgur.com/MNWgjPu.jpg):

You build an arch at ground level with 2 reinforced metal ramps extending each way. You connect the builds with metal, and put respawn pads at the connection. You start normally by editing the arch.

There are only 2 rules total. Don't shoot until you've built above the metal, and don't shoot the metal. Everything else is fair game. I also suggest turning fall damage on (it's on in the real game, and making people take fall damage is a legitimate strategy), and if you don't want to take fall damage, then spawn glider redeploy items.

For some legitimacy, see how tom and vivid were doing 1v1 practice [last night](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/401282232?t=02h33m00s). Note the *large* amount of build breaking.

Furthermore, most PCs can run the game at much higher fps (especially in moving zones) they can stretch their res and from my experience get better ping.

As you can see when placing or editing a build item it starts at a percentage of its full health and gains health over time until it reaches its maximum available health.

I have no issue with this mechanic, but I believe this is the main reason for all the lag and server strain in late game circles.

Any time you place an initial build item the server needs to do 8 calculations (one per second) to calculate the current health of the item until it reaches max health.

A simple 1x1 with a roof cone requires the server to do 48 calculations (6 per second for 8 seconds)

As soon as you place 40 players in a final circle that’s 1,920 server side calculations (240 per second for 8 seconds) if everyone built a single 1x1 .

This is obviously nowhere near the amount of building that happens end game so you can see how this mechanic can put a huge strain in the servers and create issues.

This also does not account for the additional calculations added by editing which strains the server even more.

TLDR: in my opinion server issues are due to build health regeneration. ",FortniteCompetitive

I'm playing in a Ps4 slim since April/May 2018, and lately ( not talking about all the other bugs ) I'm having a huge FPS drop in EVERY buildfight. I know that if I want better performances i should buy a PC, and also that the Ps4 pro could be a possible upgrade, but that's not the point here.

Console players can't even see their FPS, but I scored 100+ in multiple gauntlet cups and 35+ in pop-ups, so I know what it feels like to play in low fps ( endgame issues, even fir Pc plays ).  I've never had this problem in the last year, maybe in creative sometimes / hotdropping tilted when there are a lot of people in the same building

I just want to know if it's a common issue or if I should change my console, I play with replays off, and a 1080p, 75Hz 1ms benQ monitor. Also playing in 40-60 ping on EU servers.

I barely post on this sub ( always reading ), but that's a serious issue and my friends don't seem to understand what I'm talking about.

What if vehicles needed gas, fuel or battery charge to run...which can be recharged or refueled, BUT with every circle the energy usage doubles - or in other words its fuel depletes faster and faster - very much how you lose health faster and faster (in the storm) later in the game.

Example. (Made up/hypothetical numbers)

Let's say in the beginning you can use any vehicle for about 120 seconds (in form of a fuel/Energy/bluglo ""bar""). 

Maybe you can even stop somewhere to refuel or recharge.

In the next circle the fuel or battery depleted twice as fast, giving you approx 60 seconds of use. (For a full charge) 3rd circle about 30 seconds of use. (Full charge) 4th would be 15 seconds band 5th like 7.5 seconds...

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, if a console only pop-up cup was available, it would have absolutely no affect on the PC community or their pop-up cups.  PC players may struggle in the pop-up cups because they would no longer be killing console players with 60fps capped, however they cant really complain about that, because they would then be on a level playing field.

&amp;#x200B;

Why should a console player have to heavily invest in a PC in order to enjoy the competitive nature of fortnite. It would be amazing to play in a pop-up cup and know that i am on a level playing field with my competitors. I am not chasing a dream of being a pro fortnite player, however i do really enjoy playing scrims and watching the tournaments. Why not make it fair?

&amp;#x200B;

I am in no way talking about winning money via these tournaments, (in fact, why cant we just have normal pop-up cups with no prize money or tournament qualification) i am purely just asking that console players have the opportunity to compete on a level playing field (with no prize money).

I watched some of the Blackheart cup live, it was the first time I have ever just stopped and given up watching, it was so boring to watch. straight into midgame turtles and following the storm.

I think one of the best events I watched was when Ayden went off on a rampage, Good fights are fun to watch, lots of action.

• Enemy phasing will be a non-issue.

The bad:

• Audio.. okay this is where it’s tricky. I’m convinced the sound team over there has way too much pride to simply revert the audio. They’ll add a half-assed “raised enemy pickaxe volume by 0.00001 dB” and “cannonball now sounds more like a fart”

Is there a better solution?,"Competitively speaking I don't think the player with better ping should win the wall replacement. I don't really have a solution but with the way it currently works higher ping players are at a pretty significant disadvantage in these particular situations. Let me be clear though, I am in no shape, way, or form promoting that the turtling player should be able to hide in their 1x1 with no counter play. 

I play on NAE with anywhere from 45-55 ping so I am always adjusting my game play with that in mind. But it can still be frustrating at times when I lose my wall instantly and yes, I know I need to make a play on the player fighting for my wall but sometimes it's not always possible. The reason I find it frustrating though is because I find myself a lot of times trying to get in a 1x1 but when I realize I'm not going to beat their turbo build I have to resort to one of the various techniques for forcing my way into their 1x1. Any decent player though will recognize what I'm doing and make the edit play on me, when this happens I have to be ready to take a shot or make a quick counter play myself. 

With all that being said I sorta wish we could figure out a better way to balance these situations. Hopefully someone can offer some of their ideas or opinions on the topic.

When you’re boxed up in the 3rd 4th or 5th circle you are fine with editing a window to spray a build or take a couple shots at someone who has to rotate early. But you won’t edit a window to put a couple shots into a baller. If just a few people put a couple bullets into one it will be gone. It really doesn’t seem like a lot. 

True, you’re not going to spray the entire ball and then spray the guy inside for a kill. But if everyone puts a couple shots into the balls they see just rolling by, there would be far fewer of them in late circles. ",FortniteCompetitive

Many of the top names will not qualify for the World Cup, rather some guy who happened to get a 15 kill game off the bat will take a spot. 

This system also judges a skill that is different from what the finals will be. The qualifier judges a players ability to “race” to as many points as possible, all while not playing in the same lobbies as their top opponents. The World Cup final will be with custom lobbies which is a far different skill from an open system. Some players are naturally better at one rather than the other and this will result in having a less competitive World Cup. 

What the qualifiers should be is a mix between open qualifiers and custom lobbies. The system I came up with is very similar to the winter royal qualifiers.
- First, for each region there will be an open qualifier spread across multiple weekends like it is now. The top 400 players from the series will move on to the next round.
- Next the players will be seeded based on number of points in the first round and placed into 4 custom tournaments of 6 games. Top 50 from each will move on to the next round
- reseeded based on placement from the last round and placed into 2 custom tournaments of 6 games and the top 50 move on.
- the last round before the World Cup will be a custom tournament of 10-12 games and the you will have to be in the top 30(NAE) players to move on to the World Cup.(# of players that go to the WC from each region stays the same as it is now).
- finally, numbers will be adjusted for each region, so a smaller region may only have the top 200 from the open qualifiers.

This style will reward consistency rather than a player having an amazing and lucky day. And will overall reward the best players making for the best possible World Cup. 




Of course, this system is not perfect and no qualification system for a multi million dollar tournament should be made in one afternoon(I’m looking at you epic games), so please don’t nitpick and talk about it as a whole. ",FortniteCompetitive

(90’s and shotguns fights are exponentially harder against a pc player because of this) having your build button as a paddle also allows for instant builds without stopping your movement or direction your aiming. 

Second, the controllers allows you to adjust the way the sticks respond to your movements, affects of “deadzones” and allow for shorter trigger pulls to shoot.

Its a rough transitional period, sure. But after a few weeks you will drastically improve. High skill players will absolutely melt you if you are exposed, and being able to jump flick and build behind you instantaneously with paddles can be the difference between taking a chip shot and geting absolutely smoked. 

Lastly, adding a higher stick for your RS( the one you aim with) will give you much more control over your accuracy. Kb+m will always be the superior input method, but i promise you will see a huge jump in your performance with these changes, and it is well worth the investment. you’ll be godly in console only pub matches with these advantages, most players dont expect you to have these perks.

Make.the.change.

Argument 1: the points on kills is fine, if there was no points on kill there would be no incentive to do anything ever. Even if you hit someone for 150 what’s the point in going for the finish other than loot. Points on kill is necessary for entertaining games as well as increasing the skill gap for better players to prosper. That doesn’t mean i agree with W keying first storm outside circle, that’s dumb, but i think it’s necessary points on kill. 

Argument 2: Not enough people qualifying for finals, long story short, yes there is you just have to play well and consistent to make it through. Top 3000 is not hard and if you can’t make that I’m sorry. I understand only 10 games is hard to be consistent but you have to be consistent as possible and they have to have some measurement on qualifying, just be happy it’s open qualifiers. 

Argument 3: The game needs to be optimized more and fixed before World Cup, and i totally agree. The game needs to be polished a bit but again, I’m happy we’re allowed an attempt at qualifying in general. None of us “should” qualify, everyone has to earn it and some people will get lucky while others don’t.  

I understand it’s frustrating if the time frames don’t work out for you or you get greiffed in a game, it sucks, but it is a Battle Royale and we can all always get better. I understand other things like hamsterballs are annoying and the game needs to be optimized and those are also different arguments, in talking strictly qualifying

- finding shields
- finding a shotgun

So the first thing I'd like to see is that everyone starts with 200hp instead of 100. Positive effects: obviously you don't have to pray to find shields faster than your opponent, no stupid 50/50 pickaxing off spawn, not getting one pumped by blue/legendary pump body shots, everyone has 100hp worth of shield more in his inventory for mid/late game

Secondly, I'd like to see the pistol being vaulted but everyone starts with a grey pistol in his inventory. Combined with the 200hp change, you would have a theoretical chance against somebody who gets a pump off spawn and rushes you immediately. We all know the situation where six floor loot spots in a row you find ammo/mat stacks/bandages etc and this would counter this to an extent. ( You could even go as far as vaulting the grey tac shotgun and let everyone start with it)

Let’s try to explain why snipers aren’t a good choice to have in a battle royale like Fortnite.

1. No counter-play.

You could be farming a tree and then get sniped in the head from 120m out. There was nothing you could have done to have avoided that apart from not being there. 

You could also be based up and pressuring a player below you with AR shots and then someone happens to have an angle on you and manages to snipe you with a easy headshot while you didn’t even know they were there. In a game like battle royale with 100 players landing, it’s impractical to keep a track of every player and the fact that someone could end your game within a split second because they happened to find an angle on you seems too OP.

Even if the shots aren’t headshots, the damage is still too strong (especially for the heavy sniper)

2. 200+ damage

People have been comparing snipers to shotguns saying that pumps can also hit for 200+. Let’s clear up this false equivalency. For a shotgun to do any amount of effective damage, you have to be in a close range, especially if you are gonna hit a 220 headshot. You can avoid this by navigating through the engagement based on footsteps, you can build and you can also disengage the fight if you feel like you don’t have an advantage anymore. The only time you may not be able to avoid this is if someone was camping and you didn’t know which is pretty rare let’s be honest because most of the times you position yourself in your own builds after early game so it’s pretty hard for you to not know someone’s close to you.

With snipers, you can get dinked for 200+ damage from 200 m out. Would that require skill? Absolutely. Could the person getting shot have avoided it at all? Not unless he knew that person had an angle with a sniper.


As fun as snipers are, I just don’t think they work well in Fortnite battle royale where people can quickly edit windows and take quick peeks at you and if you aren’t covering absolutely every angle possible, you could pay a very hefty price. I also think it discourages people to peek more (no wonder people don’t shoot hamster balls) due to the risk it carries.

This isn’t meant to be a complaining post, I’m just tryna clear up why pros have been talking about vaulting snipers. I don’t think they are game breaking and there’s definitely stuff that needs more urgent attention, but wanted to clear up some misconceptions about snipers. Like I said, if the snipers stay in the game, I wouldn’t be too upset (heavy sniper has to go though).",FortniteCompetitive

**Give lesser used weapons some type of special feature.** 

**Example:** 

1. **The Infantry rifle could ALWAYS have first shot accuracy**
2. **The pistol can do 3 times head shot damage with a .5 second reload**
3. **The purple/gold rarities of SMG can do double damage to buildings with a ramping fire rate.**
4. **The tatical shotgun could get a range boost (call it high powered shells or something) so that it covers more mid range play and a draw speed like the other shotguns**

The heavy sniper already has a feature like this (being able to one shot a structure or tree) and has been an amazing addition to the game. It is time to add a little ""pizzazz"" to and love to a few items so we get more viable options to play with.

&amp;#x200B;

The theme of battle royale games is to survive and be the last person or team alive.  People called for kill incentives to make the games less boring to watch, and Epic has even given prize money for most kills (Thanks for the 10k epic).  What I am suggesting is that there only be kill incentives in game and then points should only come from placement.  The goal of getting kills should be to help you win or place better not be an objective in a tourny.  They could go several routes with this.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Rather than simply 50 hp on kill I'd propose 25% damage done to an opponent (50 hp on a 200hp kill).  I've seen people in this subreddit talk about getting shield for an assist so this would double for that.  This also works as an incentive to shoot people and accrue as much damage as you can late game.

&amp;#x200B;

2) damage buff/damage reduction.  What comes to mind is kill streaks in Modern Warfare. For example, 3 kills get you a 10% damage incoming reduction. 5 kills gets you a 10% increase damage to all guns.  7 kills gets you a maximum health of 225hp.  It really can be anything or any number, but the idea remains the same.  Kills are a tool used for winning.  

&amp;#x200B;

3) Mats on kill.  Already in game, but a variation on this would be to perhaps increase mat cap for every kill?  Say  50 wood for 1 kill, 50 brick for 2 kills, 50 steel for 3 kills, another 50 wood for 4 kills, etc.   So by kill 5, for example, you can carry 600 wood, 600 brick, and 550 steel.

&amp;#x200B;

As I write these out I feel like they're too complicated.  People and the fortnite community (casuals in particular) prefer simplicity, but the concept is right in my opinion.  Someone who decides to play a bit more risky and are all buffed going into late game should have a serious advantage, but the player who is more risk adverse and avoids as many engagements as possible still has a good shot at placing well.  I just think the goal should be to win or place well and kills should have no influence how a tournament is scored outside the game.

451,Horbie,1553490646,b56iup,23,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b56iup/on_the_competitiveness_of_snipers/,45,On the Competitiveness of Snipers,"There's been a lot of talk about the place of snipers in competitive recently, but unfortunately most of the talk I've seen has been over twitter and through short messages where I don't think people are really getting their points across.

So I wanted to take a swing at a hopefully clearer and more in-depth discussion on this. And fingers crossed peeps can actually talk about it meaningfully in the comments.

I'm prefacing this with two statements, so you know my biases off the bat:

1. It obviously takes skill to hit sniper shots. These guns are not skill-less.

2. I do not believe snipers are healthy for the competitive meta

-----

I want to start by comparing the cost of playing around enemies that have ARs and enemies that have snipers (the two longest range weapons in the game).

The AR:

Playing around an AR doesn't cost much. You can essentially run out in the open and react to getting hit with an AR only taking ~60ish damage even when the enemy is pretty close range. That’ll cost you  like 60 mats if you box up and whatever heals you may use to heal up.

Obviously you can get hit for much more than that even if you’re fast to react, so the better play is to play around natural cover, choose your rotations to avoid positions where enemies could have strong angles on you, and move unpredictably to make yourself a harder target to hit. This costs you time - it takes more time to make these safer rotations, but luckily ARs are mid-range guns, there are not too many angles you need to be careful of, and the cost in time is not so much.

You can react to AR shots, and ARs are midrange, so combining both counterplays, you do not spend too much of your economy (in terms of mats/heals/time) to counter potential enemies having ARs.

The Sniper:

On the other hand playing around the sniper is expensive. You can't react to getting hit by a sniper - reacting after the shot means you either you are already dead or you are just blocking follow up AR shots. And getting hit is at least half your health, and potentially your whole game.

Because you can't react, playing around a sniper is entirely pre-emptive: natural cover, safe rotations, moving unpredictably. Unlike the AR, the sniper has a much longer range, so there are many more angles to consider when making these safer rotations. That means these safer rotations cost more in terms of time. And because you cannot react to a sniper, that also means these rotations cost more in terms of mats, since you should be building preemptively.

You can’t react to sniper shots, and snipers are midrange, so the counterplay against a sniper is very costly on your economy (in terms of mats/heals/time).

-----

Now that we've talked about how playing around ARs and snipers differs, let's talk about how this plays out in a competitive game.

If you are trying to be competitive in a cup, you can't expend your resources playing around snipers that may or may not be there (sure you can play around snipers that you know are there, but this is much less costly). If you did, you would be so late on rotations that you would never gain a strong position in the circle, and you would be so low on mats that if you managed to make it to end game you would not be competitive. It’s an irresponsible use of your economy, and frankly a bad decision if you are trying to score points. (Feel free to debate me on this, but I stand by it)

Once a player has decided that they shouldn't expend an unreasonable amount of resources to play around potential snipers all they will be doing to counter unknown snipers is moving unpredictably - if you decide to play around potential snipers, you are throwing your game by ruining your economy. 

This means that there is not meaningful counterplay around snipers, because the effective counterplay would wreck your economy and is not a decision a competitive player should make. At this point your interaction with the enemy who has the sniper is minimal. From their end it’s a PvE game for whether or not they can land the shot. From your end it’s a slot machine on whether or not there is a player around you with a sniper who will hit their shot. This lack of interaction, and the lack of meaningful counterplay in my eyes makes the sniper unhealthy for the competitive meta.

-----

Yes RNG is part of a battle royale, and that is something that has really drawn me to Fortnite. The best players are players that are able to mitigate this RNG well. But I don’t feel the RNG should create too much variance over the span of the 10 potential games in a cup. And the potential for your game to be ended without any misplay or interaction on your end is too much. If someone w-keys you or storm pushes you, it’s frustrating that it could end your game even though you haven’t misplayed, but at least you have the opportunity to fight back, there’s meaningful player interaction there.

-----

I also want to address why snipers can work in other games.

Snipers work well in other games with modes like team death match because they are typically power weapons that spawn at set locations on the map. Throughout the entire game every player is aware of where the sniper is and which team controls it - they will know when they have to play around it and can then appropriately spend resources to counter it. But that information is never available in a BR where snipers can drop out of any chest (unless we can get every player carrying a sniper to fire some shots in the air every so often to let the other players nearby know there is a sniper in play, and even then the audio cue won’t be heard by everyone within the sniper’s range), so players are never able to knowledgeably spend the appropriate resources to counter them.

-----

I wouldn't be opposed to having snipers in only supply drops. It would force all players to be more aware of where supply drops spawned, so that they can be more cautious around those areas. By the later parts of the game when rotations will have jumbled the potential sniper locations, every player should be effectively playing around snipers anyway.

But how many people would even take a sniper out of a supply drop? Prolly not a lot, so that honestly feels like a silly solution to this problem.",FortniteCompetitive

I know these players in the finals are better than others I face (Like Ghost Sean twice), but I don't feel I'm losing due to mechanical skill, but strategy.

Battle royale can be so tilting sometimes where one thing doesn’t go your way and the game is over (especially in solos). There are so many rng factors to fornite that it is nearly impossible to perform consistently and get results no matter how hard you practice and train. Also, from a spectator standpoint it can be incredibly boring as most players play super passive and sit in a box the whole game. Hmm sitting in a box the whole game in a game where the combat is super in depth and entertaining to see doesn’t make sense. Those people who practice their mechanics day in and day out should be rewarded. We want to see nutty plays, we want to see crazy close finishes, most importantly I want to grind fortnite every day and actually see results. I have over 3000 hours in the game and I’ve performed above average but never good enough and it makes me begin to wonder what if I put the same hours into an actually competitive game such as COD, CS Go, Rocket league, or even league of legends. I guarantee you I would be playing on the main stage right now living my dreams.

It gets pretty annoying and I try to avoid double editing as much as possible because of it. I’m a controller player on pc and I think this issue is exclusive to controller players and I don’t see it happening to kb/m players. It would be really nice for epic to include this in their next update.,FortniteCompetitive

I started competitive gaming on csgo and then after a break moved to fortnite. I the last few weeks I thought that the main reason why im not a pro yet was the 60hz monitor and 50fps lategame untill todays blackheart cup. I realised that the real problem was not the potato setup or my skill but my nerves. For example in the semi finals I had 4 points after 6 games and got really mad so I landed tilted not caring about the games I had left and then finished with 43 points. Same happened on the finals where I managed to win a 7kill endgame game after dying 7 times to the first person I fought finishing with only 19 points. The reason why these tournaments are so important to me is because I want to prove a point to my parents, friends and my country that Esports is an actual thing and I can someday live off it and I really need a better setup. I played against one of the best players in my country (he got 39 points on the finals after streaming for 24 hours). I destroyed him first time we did 1v1's and had similar scores on creative moving zones that he hosted for viewers. I really need some advise but dont want to message actual pro and waste their time with this paragraph I wrote in the middle of the night. Thanks.",FortniteCompetitive

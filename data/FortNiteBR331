Not having a skin doesn't mean you're bad at the game or somehow a less respectable player, it just means you didn't spend your real, hard-earned money on a digital cosmetic item for a video game. 

And yet people all throughout this community talk about ""no skins"" like it's supposed to be degrading or insulting. Have you ever been broke? Because a lot of the time you're shit talking people for being broke and it's probably not even their fault.

So since season 4 I haven’t played much because personally I was disappointed with the new season update. I’m level 40. So I still put a decent amount of time into the game. Problem is I always die to a shotgun battle. It’s never anything else! I rather die by rocket launchers... 

So I was playing my first solo showdown which was campers paradise because I couldn’t find anyone! I finally manage to get top 2, and some guy decided to have a build battle with me.  Now I’m pretty decent at build battles and so was he/she. I hit him 3 times with a shotgun during the fight. I literally hit a 6, 20, 6... with a blue tactical shotgun while we was build fighting...

Finally got him corner as he runs down the building and the circle is extremely small... and I die... with one shot. I have 100 shield and 100 health... worst part was he jump n hip fire and that’s it... it was over. 

Shotguns are so inconsistent and if they enable to a weapon you die by, 100% and I’ll put my life on it that shotguns are the highest way I die.

Last night we decided we were going to land loot lake pier's over and over, grab whatever loot was there, keep a gun, drop everything else in the road and wait for some unsuspecting victim to come grab it, then jump out and jebait the shit out of them. It was great. It started out hiding behind walls, then we started hiding in pyramids, then it became building full blown ""battle scenes"" with a marriot of loot, jebaiting multiple teams through the course of a game. We actually found moving over to what we call death valley (the area just next to the waterfall, outside of loot lake and next to where people exit tilted to be the best place to do this. A few times we were able to get 4 or 5 teams and come out absolutely looted for the rest of the game.

Does anybody else have anything similar that they like to do to break up the monotony of the game?

As you may know, the season 4 tier 100 reward is Omega. And it looks 1 billion times cooler with the whole set of armor.

However, I am worried that I will not be able to make it to Level 80 by the end of the season. I was wondering if anyone who is a high tier, and consider themself to be good at the game, play some games with me for an XP Boost which will really help me out a lot.

I play on PC, my Gamertag is Zacmeister06.

Thank you all, and I hope to be playing with sone of you soon. Please do speak to me in the comments.

One you click purchase on an item you want you get a small refund time added at the top right of your screen. You will be allowed 10 minutes to use the item to see if you want to keep it or not. If you refund before the 10 min. then your vbucks return to your account and if its exceeds the 10 min. timer then it permanently becomes yours (No refunds available after this point) If you try and purchase the item again it will be permanent.  The reason i suggest this is because many only buy the new skins for the backbling.  I personally only use the Gingerbread man skin and would like to see how the backbling looked on him before i bought the new skin.  It would give us a chance to see how it looked in game as well to see if we truly want the item.    ",FortNiteBR

Rewards for revives and teamplay such as saving players like in CSGO can be implemented into the game, there could be a point based system. These points would course give some sort of rank of maybe the pleasure of getting into lobbies with players that have the same amount of points.

I wanna say i love this game, but there's a number of things that Irritate me.

1. The Dominance of the shotgun, too many times i have died because they had a shotgun and I didn't
2. Concentration of players in a single area, I came into this game under the impression that most people would go to separate parts of the map, instead I find that most people just drop in the same 2\-3 places that being tilted towers, dusty divot and occasionally pleasant park. Which ultimately results in most games there being a mad dash to find the first weapon and kill as many people as possible.
3. Building:This is probably just my lack of skill, but late game building is like bloody wizardry to me. I try by the best i can do is just get a basic fort built up in like 3\-4 seconds. Meanwhile i see people look like they are just spinning around and they got towers up in seconds, how do you even do that?

I'm just really confused, cause there seems to be no middle ground. I could go to the very populated areas and thus get the good loot, but i likely wont make it out alive. I could go to some of the more isolated areas on the map, but not only is there a good chance i wont get the gear i need, and even if i make it to the top 10 it wont matter if i can't actually duke it out with the people that made it to the end. I need to get better but i can't do that if i don't go to the more chaotic areas, in short I really don't know what to do.",FortNiteBR

However, it is obviously overpowered. The game is thrown totally off balance as a result, and it honestly makes the game unenjoyable to have a cornered opponent throw a wall right in front of you.

If you add bullet penetration, it would balance the game in a fair way. Having different damage reduction levels for wood, brick, metal, and constructing vs constructed pieces would reduce camping and the reliance on wall spamming.

Consider, half damage for some weapons through wood, one third damage through brick, and one quarter damage through metal. Through two built pieces, half the damage reduction through one wall. Through two pieces of wood, one quarter damage. Through two pieces of brick, one ninth damage. Through two pieces of metal, one sixteenth damage.

Of course, if you were going to weaken walls in this way, doubling their hit points would also be fair.

https://i.redd.it/tuphfvlfy7z01.png

**Why this is needed?**

1\) For me ""Editing Mode"" is not opening like always i wanted, probably its glitching and sometimes when i see that it didn't open i press the G \-I'll use G in this article since it is default input\- again, it opens and closes that time and i need to press again. This is so frustrating and we/i need to press 3 times for just opening. Also i saw some streamers struggling with that.

2\) Sometimes when i try to edit my platform it opens the wall editing. I'm not sure but i think i'm pressing 2 times and first that i pressed opening lately so i need to exit wall editing mode and again try to look and press the G button and edit the platform and then again press G for confirm it then exit. This looses me a lot of time and effects my play.

3\) As a player i'll gain a lot of time, even all of the new players will gain time cause i think it is easier to adapt with muscle memory and the time that we are wasting is actually big. For example, you are in a box and someone is trying to shot down the wall in front you to hit and if you could immediately edit your right or left wall to exit and kaboom. People already do that i know but remember the reason 1.

4\) I think this will solve the glitching problem from its root. Also this will look more professional to see from third person and will only need pressing a button just ONCE.

5\)  Again as a player, the OPENING and CLOSING shouldn't be the struggle for editing mode and the game's diffuculty/experience. This editing mode should be providing convenience for all players and aim for that. I think ""Editing Mode"" is  good enough for the ""Save the World"" mode but not enough for the ""Battle Royale"" mode.

**So what is it?**

Editing mode will open while we HOLD the G button. We won't need to look for a building piece to enter editing mode. If the building piece is ours and we are in the range of it, game will immediately show the squares that we know. When our crosshair out of the building piece that we already edited, it will be reset\(\*\*\*\) and will enter the editing of the building piece that crosshair on it. After the editing the building piece letting the G button will confirm the edit that you did. With this turbo edit, players will only need to press a button ONCE. So say goodbye to hitting our heads to wall while trying exit. 

\*\*\*: If Epic wants a new mechanic in their game, with this turbo edit looking to another building piece WON'T RESET the editing that we did so we can do multiple edits at the same time and we can fake and confuse the player that shooting to us while we are in a box.  With this feature there will be new plays.

**End of the suggestion**

This provides a lot to player. Thanks if you read my suggestion. Comment what you think of that. Sorry if i did any grammer and writing mistake. I apologies for that. If i remember a thing i'll edit this.",FortNiteBR

I'm suggesting you make it so we can toggle this feature on and off just like auto-run or something.  The feature would allow players using builder-pro the option to build on the first click of the hotkey.  

For example, you are running and want to build a ramp.  You go builder mode, and press your hotkey.  In my case, it's L2 on the ps4.  When I click L2, a ramp doesnt appear in front of me but instead a hologram of where the ramp would be appears, then I have to click L2 again.   My proposal is that EPIC should give us the option to just click that hotkey once and let the ramp appear.  

""But we would have ramps spawning in the wrong places without having a way of knowing first where it would be placed."" 

Well my response to you, concerned citizen, is that ramps STILL spawn in the wrong place even with the current features in place.  Fear not, though, I have your answer.  A way to fix this would be to make it so that if you HOLD the key down, it appears as a hologram until you release the key.  It still makes it 1 click instead of two, and for the more cautious members of our community they would still have the option to see where they are placing their structures before committing that 10 wood.

Been playing fortnite on the Xbox for a while now. I'm an average player but I'd really like to step it up a notch.

I have been converted to the PC master race for a few years now for most of my gaming but I haven't played ANY shooters at all on PC ever. 

I have played literally thousands of games of league of legends though and made it as high as plat 2 and played a fair amount of MMO/RPG games as well as Dota 2. So I'm not totally retarded when it comes to gaming on the PC. 

That said I'm literally so bad at fortnite on the PC i actually just connected my controller to the PC. But I want to begin the process of learning to use mouse and keyboard for obvious reasons.

Does anyone have any keybindings they would recommend or settings?

Also would it help to try and play some other shooters like Counterstrike or something too? 

Any and all advice is more than welcome!

Tl;Dr: experienced fortnite player on console wants keybinding/setting advice and general advice for switching to PC. ",FortNiteBR

Snipers are the only guns the bullet's affected by gravity.

Snipers seem to be the worst if you can't headshot the enemy from across the map.

Dusty Divot is too often too empty. Maybe 2 to 4 players in a standard match go there.

50v50 is always one-sided.

The daily challenges are sometimes too hard for very bad players.

Building Battles. Just building battles.

Bushes.

Laggy Bus Jump and flights. Nowhere else in BR it lags that much.

Most of the problems that are being posted on here now aren't bugs, they're inconsistencies, by this I mean things that sometimes work as they should/we would like them to and then the next time round there's a different outcome. A few of my biggest problems and from the general consensus of this sub most people will agree are... 
1. Wall placements - the fact that this hasn't been addressed is crazy, the amount of times I've died because I've tried to put a wall in front of me whilst being shot at but it places the wall behind my opponent (2 grids away) which allows them a clean shot on me just isn't right, I should have to look directly at then floor to place it in front of me, I don't think I've ever actually wanted to place it 2 grids away but it's just the way we've had to play all this time...
FIX - Place on closest grid.
2. Building baby sized walls/ramps - When in the river between salty and tilted/shifty any building you place always places a half piece, this then means you have to place two pieces to make a reasonable sized wall to cover yourself etc, the other day I had a guy with RPGs shooting at me and I quickly built a wall to either side of me (small panel and then one on top to actually cover myself) but then as I built a third wall it connect to the normal sized pieces which left a tiny gap underneath and an RPG got through, it's hard to explain this unless you've built in the water yourself but it's annoying and I feel not needs addressing. A friend of mine said it's to do with the actually grids underneath the map and how the building connects to them but I asked can it not be highered so that the pieces placed are just normal sized, this happens throughout the map on certain hills etc and either causes you to not run onto your ramp because it's placed slightly off the ground or it builds a tiny ramp in which case you get shot over it for the split before you place another ramp on top.
FIX - I'm not sure how the grids work as I don't nor have I ever done programming but i felt i wanted to mention it.
Turbo Building - This is kind of a bug but also an inconsistency, this also got addressed in the last patch but nothing seems to have changed, very simple, it doesn't build when holding down the button, yes I know you're meant to tap it once then hold it but even when doing this sometimes it just doesn't build and it can cause you fall to your death if in a build fight or can cause you to take extra damage if your trying to spam walls whilst being AR'd across the map etc. 
FIX - just build lol. 
Finally... Shotguns - don't tell me shots are missing etc when there's hundreds of clips of people standing still, shooting someone in the back of the head and doing 40 damage etc, I'm not expecting a one shot everytime, I'm just asking for consistency, people can claim a shotgun has spread but in a video game and one like fortnite that has so many close range engagements The shotguns need to be consistent. Yes spread can exist but the spread should be the same with every shot, this means that if the shotgun has 5 pellets (just an example) then 1 pellet should be in either corner and the last pellet in the centre, in this case if you had your full crosshair on the opponent all 5 pellets would hit, dealing max damage, if the left hand side of your crosshair was off but the centre and right side were on target, you'd hit the 3 pellets and dealing 60% damage... and so on. Currently the spread is so random that one shot all the pellets could be bunch in the top left with 1 in the centre, you feel like you've aimed perfectly and the centre of your crosshair is on your opponents head but if the top left corner is slightly off then only 1 pellet will hit and that's how we get a lovely number 9 pop up but then the next shot the spread could bunch in the bottom right, you could technically drag your shit too far across but because the bottom right hits the opponent you deal 200+ damage, this isn't me suddenly hitting my shot, if anything my aim is worse but due to the spread being 'inconsistent' I 1 pump some poor dude. 
Yes this is long but I'm scared that inconsistencies will ruin this game or spoil it in the competitive scene, AR bloom is another big one that has been tweaked here and there but can and will cause huge controversy in a tournament I can guarantee, someone will be aiming directly on some, every bullet will miss and the opponent will turn around and laser them, I'm still confused as to why bloom actually exists, anyway if anyone's still reading at this point then thank you but I just love this game and feel that if things don't get tweaked it could start losing some of its players due to it being frustrating and even slightly unenjoyable to play.

Biggest issue of course is consistency. An idea I've had to balance it would be rather than a random spray out pellets, simply have the shotgun fire slugs with a severe damage drop off. That way you've got consistency via one aimed projectile instead of a bunch of random smaller ones. At X range you do Y damage every single time you fire and hit at that range.

As for accuracy, either keep a first shot accuracy no matter what to promote the practice of running and jumping all over with shotguns, or add bloom so moving and jumping and stuff makes the gun less accurate. Combined with the slugs idea, it's like you're firing a hunting rifle super close (but with the bigger magazine and fire rate and such).

Just a thought I have that'd make it easier to make shotguns far more consistent. If Epic is trying to have this game taken seriously as a competitive title, the mainstay weapon of the game can't be complete RNG.

The accuracy combined with shitty damage AND damage drop off is horrendous, takes nearly a clip to kill someone unless you're tapping (which will fuck you over at game start), and then when their teammates inevitably come around, you have half a clip of light ammo. What the fuck.

Been like this for months, do devs even play this fucking game? if they do, they must drop places like fucking race track every round and never encounter more than one enemy with a shitty silenced smg at game start

That's the key here - no weapons. Keep farming stuff until you find someone, let them start playing aggressive on you, then build your way to safety. Since you don't have the option to shoot them on the ground, you're forced to outbuild them - make your goal to waste their materials, as well as their time. If they die in the storm with you, even better (or maybe i'm just a bad person). 

This is surprisingly fun, and really effective at building up your skills. It only took me about 10 games of doing this to noticeably increase my building speed and efficiency, and I still even now throw in a game like this every once in a while - it's genuinely fun, and you can get some funny kills from editing people out so they drop, and sometimes people will just fall on their own which is pretty hilarious as well. 

This really helped because while I was a mid-level player, I found that i'd either kill people on the ground using hardly any building, or i'd get immediately outbuilt and killed within 10 seconds. There weren't many opportunities to practise build battles against evenly skilled players. By having no offensive options or guns, your only focus is on getting that high ground. Since other players are looking for shots on you while that's happening, their pure build speed is hampered, and your pure build speed is quicker than if you were trying to shoot at the same time, if that makes sense. It evens up skill differences in building a fair bit. 

Hope this can help at least someone out there, it really did work for me!",FortNiteBR

The only way I would be willing to take the gamble and complete a transaction is if they were willing to show up in a game lobby and verify they actually own the account/skins. I knew there was a high chance of being scammed, but to me it was worth the risk. The player with the mic is actually the owner of both accounts. I'd actually be very happy if all 3 of our accounts were banned for this. I've spent thousands on this game, and I don't care if I go down with him, as long as he can't scam any more people. I gave him multiple chances to issue a refund and he thought he would just meme me instead.

I’m not a good Fortnite player. It bothers me so much because no matter what I do, I always lose. I spam build. I hide in a bush and hold nothing. I do double pump.

All get me killed. And then the replay shows my killer takes about 3 shots to kill me, despite me shooting at least a clip at them.

Why does this happen? I do everything pros do, I play smart and don’t overextend/reveal myself.

It pisses me off because there’s 10 year olds with more victories than me.

Because it is more team based, i have been able to focus on aspects of my game that were lacking without worrying about dealing with short, dry games. I feel that my gaming has improved tremendously and i would reccomend this mode to anyone who is trying to improve as a begginer. 

I loved this mode so much it convinced me to finally get the battlepass. Its awesome. 

Of course you have teammates who will snatch your loot, shoot you out of the sky when building, etc... But bad teammates arent limited to fortnite and that's just how gaming goes.

Though I'm still a big fan of PUBG, I can see the appeal of Fortnite and it's drawn me in the past few weeks. What I'm about to share is probably already widely known, but I made a little chart for people to follow if they wish to tweak their game as I have. See, in Titanfall 2 I used color correction to change the colors of the HUD, I found that with deuteranope filter, the enemy color changed from red to yellow, which popped out more and I found it to be more noticeable. I recently tried that with Fortnite too, just as a test, and surprisingly it didn't just change the HUD colors, it changed the entire games color palette. I thought this was pretty cool, as it can be used to help tweak the coloration of the game to your liking, even if you're not colorblind. And to top it off, HUD elements are pretty much unchanged. Anyways, as I said here's a chart to help other players decide if they want to try some of these color correction options, or if they're fine with the Vanilla look. I personally don't like the base game colors, and now use Tritanope 24/7. Also note that the strength of the color correction was 10 for all of the images taken.

298,SaunsTehSkeletun,1526866517,8kx885,19,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8kx885/fortnite_needs_some_form_of_skillbased_matchmaking/,0,Fortnite needs some form of skill-based matchmaking.,"Before you say ""oh you're retarded it'll kill the game"", I don't want Epic to add a *pure* mmr\-based matchmaking system. Read the entire post, please.

I know I've made a few... more ranty posts about this topic in the past, but after taking a break from Fortnite, cooling off and thinking it over, I think I have a solution to the growing skill gap, it's just too large now with the size of the playerbase.

MMR would be calculated with this system: Average Kills per Match / Win&amp;#37;. A higher MMR in this case would mean you're playing against worse players, while a lower mmr would mean you're playing against higher skilled players. As you win more games, your MMR is going to lower significantly, but if you lose a bunch in a row, you'll have a better chance of coming out on top.

But! I hear you asking, aren't there 100 players per game? Isn't it not fun to have a 50/50 chance to win every single time? Wouldn't that promote a hide\-and\-seek attitude? Well... yes. You're right. If there was a *pure* MMR\-based matchmaking system in place, the game wouldn't be very fun. There needs to be some sort of variation in the skill levels of other players.  There need to be... Skill Ranges.

A skill range is set up once the first player joins a server. Let's say JoeSchmoe gets into a game with a 3.5 MMR. Now, that server is set to only accept people within a range of 1.5\-5 MMR; 1.5 MMR above and 2 below JoeSchmoe's skill. This greatly reduces the skill gap by limiting the amount of noobs that can match with pros, while keeping the intensity and fun of the original game by allowing you to still match with higher\-skilled players.

So, what do you guys think of my non\-angry, non\-ranty idea?",FortNiteBR

After reviewing the possible reasons for such a disable to occur, I can only conclude that this account disable was due to a glitch on my account that had occurred weeks ago. I went away for the weekend to attend a Kendo tournament at Harvard University; unfortunately, I was unable to bring my desktop, so I was without Fortnite for the duration of that weekend. After coming back home, I noticed my Epic Games launcher was repeatedly kicking me saying that someone else was logging on from another location--I swiftly changed the account information and was able to get back into my account, but the first thing I immediately noticed was the ridiculous amount of payments/refunds that had been made on the account. I opened up the full purchase history and saw tons of payments/refunds that were from cards I had never used before. Luckily, I remove my card after every purchase I make just in case something like this happens. I did not think to report this at the time, but it seems like that has come back to haunt me. I have several payments on the account that are legitimate from my own card: I have bought the PvE founders edition, vbucks, and even the Starter Pack for Battle Royale. That is now 160$ lost because my account was most likely used for suspicious activities while it was not in my hands. If possible, I would even offer to repay the difference of these suspicious payments on my account if it means I can play it once again. I have been playing this game since January 2018 and have forged so many great memories with the friends I have made in not only Battle Royale, but also Save the World. I am just heartbroken that all my progress and hard earned skins are gone just like that. I hope to get my account re-enabled, so I can once again come home from work to lay back and spam some Orange Justice with the squad :(

Honestly, its getting frustrating going into the endgame against someone who hit you for 100+ instantly with a pump only pull out another one and repeat the process. It leaves little chance to fight back, and all you’re left to do is fight fire with fire, which justifies just how bland, stale and difficult it is to go against this meta. 

Rushing is such a big factor in this game, but its so cliche and uninteresting when all you have is 1 shotgun, against someone with 2. Why is it that “if we cant beat ‘em, join ‘em”?

So, talking to all BR exclusive players, could you please say that you are Playing fortnite BR, because it isn't the true Fortnite.

The true Fortnite is what people commonly called StW or Save the World.

Yes, in case you didn't know it isn't the DLC of FortniteBR, Fortnite is te real Fortnite (Mindblown)

FortniteBR is the DLC, 

Else could you please tell me where all the heroes come from (Ramirez), Weapons (Siegebreaker (Not OHHHH DAAAMMNN A GOLDEN AR), Enforcer, Backbreaker, Scoped Wasp)

And then, If they'll add some energy weapons, you know where it comes from.

Plus, the rocket that it supposed to launch in Season 5, it's gonna introduce players to the original game, understand the origins.

Thank you,

[TITLE] 3 months ago i made a post about coaching players in Fortnite, my goal back then was to help anyone who wanted (But with a restriction of 10 people for the start, to gain personal experience first, so i could offer a better coaching format) In those 3 months a lot happened in my life and I decided to not accept new players into my sessions. But a lot of players have reached out and I just can't let them down, I'm a fan of improvement and love it when others want it as well! This means I will be accepting players again and coach them to a brighter future *pogchamp*


*My first restriction, was to coach only 10 people at a time. This restriction is gone. Also I won't be doing any free sessions anymore (Have some understanding, that coaching players takes a lot of time outside of the actual sessions)

- I reccomend to take 2 sessions of 45 Minutes each (will be scheduled for your comfort) (you don't have to go for 2 sessions if you don't want to, I just think it makes sense to discuss after a week how you improved/changed with my suggestions)

- Every session will cost 5€ for now! So feel free to add me, contact me and we will set some meetings :) (first meetings won't cost you anything and you can still decide if you want to be coached)

- You need to have a microphone and headset and be able to hop on discord

- Feedback. Please let me know if I could help you. Let me now what I could do better! Don't be shy; be mean if necessary, I can take it!

- Speak english, german or italian!

Not a requirement but preferred:

- Stream! If you can stream to twitch and I could watch your games, that would be perfect and even easier for me to analyze your Pros/Cons

Here is an example of a player I coached (I forgot to put in his name in the first picture, but it's him - you can check him out on twitch and ask him about it as well ;) https://www.twitch.tv/tobyinhr )

One thing I've noticed about the transition over is that I get really nervous and my aim is everywhere when I'm battling for first place. On xbox, I had enough wins to where It wasn't a big deal to win or lose. But on PC, I have such a small number of wins that when I'm put into the perfect position to take the dub, I get nervous and shaky, and end up throwing the game.

I've tried sitting back and playing in a more relaxed position, I've tried breathing exercises while under the pressure of a 1v1, but I still end up choking.

Anyone have any advice that might help me?

-Put a floor on the ground, and stand on it before to prepare for the start of the challenge.
- Build a three level high 1x1
- Every level contains a floor, 4 walls and a ramp.
- In total there are 12 walls, 3 floors and 3 ramps (one floor you build before the challenge starts).
- After building, edit your way down to the first floor to complete the challenge. 


I suggest the hashtag #1x1buildingchallenge. 

Imagine the youtube videos of ninja, myth, tfue, sypher etc :) 

PS: I know this doesn't prove a player to be ""the best builder"", because building contains a lot of strategical choices and timing. But it would be fun to see. ",FortNiteBR

I haven't been playing for a crazy long time so I don't know all of the mechanics. For the battle pass, I am very stuck on the 2 sniper eliminations. I have been playing 50v50 and I have knocked about 6 people and eliminated 2 but for some reason they have not been counted as sniper eliminations. My question is what is the mechanic that counts it as an elimination or not?

Or better yet? Is there a better way of going about this? 50v50 has seen like the easiest way to get a sniper rifle. By the time I can find one in solo, it's only the best players left and there's no way I can snipe them. At least in 50v50 it's a little easier to find people to pick. ",FortNiteBR

Seriously, take a few deep breaths. Adrenaline is counteracted by increased oxygen, which stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system (the ""rest and digest"" response, which is the opposite of ""flight or fight"").

As soon as you start to notice your shortness of breath, shaky hands, sweatiness, etc., all the symptoms of the adrenaline kicking in, STOP. Build up a little 1x1 around yourself, and take some deep breaths. Shake your hands out a little, this will give your body an outlet to expel some of the adrenaline as well. 

Doing this little thing has done wonders for my success rate and I've been steadily increasing my solo wins at a much higher winrate than S3 (currently at 12.5% vs. just over 2% in S3, which was my first season of Fortnite). I've actually been getting adrenaline rushes much less frequently the more I win as well, which is another nice bonus. Keeping the breathing in check really helps during the moments when it still creeps up on me though. 

Thought I'd share this with you guys because I found it to be a pretty big advantage once I got it under control. The majority of players have the same nerves you do when they're in that Top X situation! Learn to control them and you'll have a sizable advantage against a large portion of the player base!

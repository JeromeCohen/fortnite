Y’all are acting like babies. Seriously. Who cares if a skin is rare? Just buy skins you think look cool. It’s a cosmetic, not a trophy to show off or brag about. If you like it, buy it, if you buy it because it’s rare, uninstall the game. If you care about rarity, uninstall the game. It doesn’t. Matter. God damn. Honestly, I’ve had all the battle passes and the renegade raider and I wouldn’t give two shits if they rereleased them. It gives people chances  to get skins they want and like. Why should someone not be able to get the knights skins if they like how they look. Now, I understand Epic wouldn’t do this and that’s fine too, but seriously. Ignore rarity. Be happy if a rare skin comes back because then other people have a chance to get it, if they really like it. Buy what you think is cool, not what is rare. Rant over.",FortNiteBR

The only skins we knew for sure were going to be rare

But they are probably not rare anymore.
I has a conversation with Tyler Buck on facebook.
First i just wanted to interview him on how working for epicgames was in the past and if he ever thought fortnite was going to be blowup like this.

But later in the interview he said this.
In the next couple of weeks before season 6 begins a couple cosmetics from season 2 and 3 will be available in the itemstore.
I ask him which items will there be in the item store and he responded with.
Rogue agent,the floss and the wave emote from season 2.
From season 3 the best mates, take the l and the dark voyager with the dark vanguard in the same store.

I didn't believe him until the rogue agent came in the store today.

Full interview will be available next monday on nu.nl

I don’t get why the hype is around it, friends I know that are not very good at fortnite are saying it’s better than it so I have this question really...

Do people who like Blackout just not like Fortnite cause they dislike they building learning curve or..? Like I’ve played Blackout for a bit now and it almost always plays out the same way PUBG did and it’s so boring. I hated PUBG for multiple reasons besides just it’s bugginess and blackout being just another battle Royale has the same things I hated. Mainly that being 1. Getting shot in the open mainly means you’re fucked since after they’ve shot you they’ll continue shooting while you’ll either have to find cover and continue getting shot running to cover, or if you’re in the flat out open just trying to get somewhere fast, you’re most likely just about to get fucking laid out
2. End game is always boring and usually about who gets luckier with end zone, someone got their tree they’ve been hiding behind for 5 mins and you didn’t? Good luck
3. Boring fights, the fights are too much like a normal call of duty tdm fight which isn’t exactly a con, but just not something fun to do again in battle Royale style. Whoever shoots and lands a shot first usually has a huge advantage

I can’t tell if I’m being a picky bitch cause I’ve adapted to fortnite br and gotten pretty good at it or maybe other people feel the same way. Blackout just isn’t fun and feels like a optimized pubg with a cod skin on it",FortNiteBR

I don’t know where else to turn for help.,"This may be a bit confusing but I’ll try explaining the best I can. 
When I created my Epic Games account I tried linking my Xbox account but it said that it was already linked to another account. When I searched for a solution for this it said my Xbox account was linked to a “nameless” account that was created when I had previously signed in using the “Sign in with Xbox” option, and that I needed to add a different email to promote it to a full-fledged Epic account. This is where the issue happens. I accidentally wrote the wrong email ( I wrote gmail instead of yahoo. Everything else is correct.) I still have full access to the account, it has my address, name, and phone number. The problem is that I cannot make any changes to the account or add 2FA because it requires me to verify my email address first which I cannot do because I typed the wrong email. And no I can’t just create a gmail with the email I used because gmail won’t let you use underscores.


When I contacted Epic Games customer support they asked me questions that I do not have the answers to and other questions that don’t apply to my account. They responded with generic responses. I felt like I was talking to a bot and not a person.


This is the info they wanted:



• Your public IP address(es) (IPv4), which you can find by searching ""What is my IP address"" in your internet browser; if you use multiple devices, please include all IP addresses.
- I followed their instructions and gave them the ip number that appears when I search “what’s my IP address”


• Date when you created your Epic Games account 
- I don't know the exact date when I created my Epic Games account. I searched if there was a way to find out. I saw other people having the same problem. I saw a message in an Epic Games forum from a mod saying that there was  currently no way of finding out when your account was created. I looked through my email  and found an “email confirmation” email and tried using that date but the Epic Games customer service employee didn’t deny or confirm if it was correct.


• An invoice ID for any Epic Games purchase you made on the account (the Invoice ID begins with an ""A,"" followed by 8 digits; example: A12345678)
• Locations (city, state/province) where you made purchases on the account
• Last 4 digits of the first payment card used on the accountI don't believe I've made any Epic Games purchases on the account. 
- I have purchased V-Bucks via the Microsoft Store but the order number does not begin with the ""A"" they are asking for. If they had reviewed my Payment History tab it says ""No charges have been made to your account yet"". So I don’t know what they want me to answer here.


• Original display name for the account
- I don’t know what they mean by that because I’ve only every typed in one display name and it’s the one I currently have on it.


• Date of your last login
- Like I mentioned before, I have full access to the account so I can log in whenever I want. I made sure to log in before responding and gave them the current date to make sure it was correct.


• Names of any PlayStation, Switch, Twitch, or Xbox accounts connected to your Epic Games account and the dates when they were connected 
- I gave them the name of my Xbox account that is linked to the Epic Games account in question, which I have full access to as well. But as I mentioned before, I don't know the exact date when I created my Epic account and connected my Xbox.


The Epic Games customer support employee was not helpful at all and said they won’t help me make the changes I requested.
I read that this sub is dev supported, so is there anybody that can help? Or will I just be stuck with this account and not be able to make changes to it and add a 2FA?",FortNiteBR

YOU NEED TO FIX  THIS

Please fix this. It would take minimal effort and we are all working way too hard to get to stage 6 Ragnarok to not be able to use him. For what it’s worth I think he’s one of the coolest skins you guys have put out which is all the more reason he should be perfectly playable.",FortNiteBR

I’m having an awesome time playing lately and I think Epic has come a long way this season from when the P90 was introduced. 

However, with new additions to the game all the time, certain weapon combos are bound to arise that are slightly stronger than they should be.

The current problem that I have noticed a lot of complaining about is the shotgun-grappler combo. 

In a game that rewards over building your opponent, this combo makes it too easy to take high ground by just aiming for it, and then instantly pulling out a shotgun for a huge burst of damage.

This problem gets even bigger when you add the double barrel into the mix, due to the fact that the grappler makes it so easy to get directly on top of your opponent.

I think both the double barrel and grappler have a place in this game, and reward players differently. The grappler is an awesome mobility item and the double barrel is great because you have to get within 1 square of an opponent to do massive damage, which isn’t easy against a good player. 

My suggestion would to be to treat the grappler as a shotgun when considering weapon swaps. The same change that buried the double pump could kill this combo, while still keeping both items viable individually. You could still use the grappler as a great mobility item, and still use the double barrel to kill someone who is too eager to get up close, but now you can’t just point, click, and barrel stuff.

Thoughts?? I really hope to see both items stay and this idea struck me while I was having a discussion in a different thread.",FortNiteBR

  No, simply not true, if you have a hard time accepting the truth I’m sorry and push your downvote; wether this is a story, rumor, or leak, if it proves to be correct it will get buried under all the “we did it” posts, but I can sit and breathe well knowing this post exists.

Rex should get an upgradable style to CHOOSE to hide his face 

Chomp SR could get upgradable style challenged where you can CHOOSE between different shark head types. 

Epic did it with tomato head, so what's stopping them from doing it with more skins? They re-release many skins on the regular, so it would incentivize more purchases on old skins, that people may have overlooked prior. 

They update emotes with facial gestures all the time (for free).

They've added back bling to characters weeks after it's launch (for free).

We got save the world skins (for free) 

What my point is, is that epic isn't only interesting in making money off you, so before you defend epic (for no reason) and say ""they will never do that it doesn't make them money"" keep in mind that they've already proven time and time again they DO stuff for the community, just because.

*""Theres a semi auto sniper on me, if anyone wants it.""*

I will write the pros of both the AR &amp; Burst. I will omit a cons list because one of the weapons pros may be the others cons and/or a pro may be better at a given action. Let's have a serious, unbiased discussion.

**AR;**

\+Automatic

\+Build dps/pressure

\+Sniper followup

\+Reliable &amp; accurate at long range

**Burst;**

\+Player dps 90+/- damage per burst to body

\+Shotgun followup

\+Burst damage

The pump shotgun is favored over a tactical because of its ability to reward good aim with high damage. This allows a player to maintain their shield with deliberate actions thanks to the **nature of burst damage**. This gun could be classified as a **game changer** because it can turn a fight thats almost lost into a victory. The tactical leaves you vulnerable while dealing damage. It has a higher rate of fire &amp; a larger ammo count. At first, this may seem like a better choice for a 1v2+. Evidentally, **a weapon that deals high burst damage is a better choice in any outnumbered situation.** Dealing damage while maintaining health, *building*, is important.

What is not important in a outnumbered situation? Build dps. *Why?* Vulnerability. *Obligatory* Spraying builds leaves you vulnerable in a 1v1, too

Choosing player dps over build dps for a primary weapon is a obvious choice when there are many readily available weapons better at build dps at close/medium range.

*The primary function for some weapons* **is** *build dps*

The burst is a high skill weapon that is very powerful and underestimated by so many here. I hope you may see why I am puzzled so many favor the AR over the burst. I have not reached a final conclusion however I have an idea...

*It's easier*",FortNiteBR

This is my opinion and you're more than welcome to disagree. Just explain why you disagree and maybe we can have an interesting conversation. 

I'll start with things I think should be added:

Chicken trooper skin, obviously. 

Ranked/MMR system. Yes I know people can make smurf accounts, but not everyone will, and the current state of the game is essentially like having everyone being a smurf. Every game has smurfs, but MMR gives you a significantly higher chance of being matched equally. Especially after lots of games played. 

In game text for squads/duos. Too often does someone not have a mic and end up talking to me through nodding of their head. If they could chat, or even quick chat (not throw up shield emotes that I can't see unless I'm right next to them), then it'd be a major help. 

*What needs to be removed*:

Bloom.. this should go without saying. Bloom is ridiculous. I understand it ""helps"" new players, but this argument is invalid. There are tons, and I mean TONS of games without bloom that still allow new players to make their way in. How could players get better with no bloom? For starters.. MMR/ranking systems. On top of that, just practice. Think of nearly every popular shooter. They use recoil instead of bloom, and people still play their games. I mean look at this video. Bloom is insane. https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vwzz2/bloom_doesnt_belong_in_this_game/

Skin prices. Skins are insanely highly priced. May just be my opinion, but paying $20 for a skin that'll be outdone in 2 days tops is crazy to me. If people are buying, then obviously they won't stop but with how often new skins come out I'm so shocked people still buy them all for $10-$20 a piece. Same with emotes. 

Shitty challenges. Challenges are the entire reason I got battle pass. I like having something to shoot for in the game. I am always excited to see cool challenges like ""find jigsaw pieces"" or ""find treasure through the maps"". But ""loot 7 chests at salty"" is dumb and easy. Just a filler challenge.

Next we have the puzzle pieces forming a loot llama upside down  
And the cube has an evil reflection effect on the characters.  
All of these things must be Epic hinting at the ""Worlds Collide"" Theme  
But one step deeper, it is  going to continue, but not necessarily into worlds collide, but maybe into  
""The Flip Dimension"" or ""Upsidedown"" or ""Reflections""  
Theme is most likely something to do with reflections or opposites!  
Not to mention the runes ""flipping"" gravity.  
and the cube ""flipping"" over and over in order to move.  
Keep an eye on loot lake, it is the largest source for reflections!

When a trap is used it's almost always offensively, on the same tile as the enemy already is.

This is unbalanced, when confronted with a trap in this manner you have to pray you're near a friendly wall or floor, or that you were holding an smg when it got placed. Otherwise you lose 75%  of your health.

I propose trap arming time is increased to 2 seconds and its health decreased to 250. The result is a trap that is impossible to use directly against an enemy but instead is used as area denial, distractions, and alerting you to an enemy.",FortNiteBR

https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9djwzw/seeing_this_makes_me_feel_weird/

And it was a wonderful feeling to see it on the front page. But then I noticed that 80% of the comments were about my weird keybinds.

A few days later i find my post on Instagram
https://www.instagram.com/p/BnbfhcSlo_D/?hl=en
https://www.instagram.com/p/BnZhP_ki8sQ/?hl=en
https://www.instagram.com/p/BnZTHvmgIAl/?hl=en
and also saw it on Snapchat

At first what triggered me was that they stole my post. But what really got to me is that 80% of the comments on all of them are along the lines of: ""keybinds are trash""
Looking even deeper in the comments i noticed the people forget YOU CAN BIND BUTTONS TO YOUR MOUSE and THERE IS AN OPTION CALLED ""Sprint by Default"" which is why i use L-Shift

What boosted my (insert all negative emotions here) was that people can't stand seeing people not using what is most commonly used. For example: R to reload, Shift to Sprint. And some comments even said that using Mouse Wheel for anything is stupid. 2 guys even said: ""fuck off and use Numbers""

Now if YOU have weird keybinds, I want you to know that as long as you feel comfortable with them and they don't limit you. Then they are beautiful keybinds.

Please for the love of the world we live in. Respect others' preferences, and please do not be ignorant of the things you can modify with your binds.

TIPS: You can turn on ""Sprint by Default"" which means you can hold forward and run without having to hold any other button.

You can bind Scroll Wheel to different things for example: Reload, Pickaxe, Trap, a Weapon, etc.

You can use Auto-Run to organize your Inventory on the Run

You can bind Locker Emotes. So if you want to quickly dance without pulling up your Emote Wheel you can just press a button and you start Dancin'

I'm sure alot of people are anxiously awaiting to see if the fan favourite skins will make a return.  It's a really hard decision for Epic because of course they want to make a huge payout but also don't want to anger alot of the more original players. It's a big decision on their part.
My idea (probably others ideas aswell) is to have Epic release an equally highquality male ghoul trooper and a female skull trooper. This would solve the want for those Halloween skins but still satisfy original players. Aswell, Epic could also give two skins with the same quality as ghoul and skull to those respective owners and never release them so they still have the elitism of having a skin no one else has. Let me know what you think.

I've tried my absolute best refraining from making any type of post or complaint about balancing that needs to happen in this game. The drum gun being vaulted was absolutely necessary, and from what I've seen, the new complaint is the DB + grappler combo but I'm not here to whine about that although I can understand why that's a problematic combo. 

No, I'm here to complain about the heavy sniper. I'm not saying it necessarily needs to be removed but it definitely needs some sort of rework. 

Here's my life.  I decide to land Tilted because I'm feeling myself a little bit tonight ya know. Everything is going well. Bada-bing, bada-boom Tilted is cleared or there's at most only one other person chilling somewhere there. I'm feeling pretty chill, rolling with 6 eliminations. Got some minis, two medkits, a legendary scar, pump, and a P90 plus I'm near max wood 300ish stone and 200ish steel with full health and half shield. I'm thinking I'm sitting pretty. I rotate on out of Tilted on my merry way. I'm out there doing a little zig-zagging, jumping as I'm moving and not doing it in any rhythm or pattern and BAM. Wouldn't ya know it? Some player body shots me with a heavy sniper. Mind you, it wasn't just any old body shot either. This bullet hits me in my MFing toe. Does it matter? Nope. I'm dead. Was it even a skillful headshot while I'm moving unpredictably? Nope. Just a good ole ""meh I'll let one rip and pray to the Fortnite gods and Kevin"". Hit me in my toe. I know it was that low because I had jumped and saw the bullet continue to impact the hill right beside me that was on level with my character models feet. 

It's just ridiculous. There's no reason that a snipe should be able to one shot someone unless it's a head dinger. I haven't done any tracking but I'm fairly certain a majority of players in the top 25 are running around with a total 125-150 health. It doesn't make sense that you just have to land a body shot on most people to eliminate them.

Is the double barrel-grappler combo ridiculous too? Absolutely, but only because of the grappler. The DB was added as a counter measure for the spray meta that meant people were going to get in your face and proceed to melt you with, at the time, OP SMGs in the blink of an eye. 

The issue at hand is time to kill. It's just too low (for specific weapons). Yes it is necessary to finish a fight quickly to avoid getting third partied but being able to get insta-killed other than getting domed with a sniper is unreasonable. The reason why the shotgun era is so heralded is because the TTK actually felt balanced. It wasn't really high meaning fights drag on and on, but it wasn't extremely low either unless you were very skilled with a shotgun and could hit a headshot or multiple headshots. 

I'm sorry for such a long post and bitchfest but I'm just salty af that someone hit me in the foot and killed me in one shot even though I was at 150 health. Unreasonable.

TL;DR - I'm salty that I got hit in the toe by a heavy sniper and died. EPIC needs to focus on balancing TTK. ",FortNiteBR

The grappel is just as bad, if not worse. It can do the same as the jump pad in terms of getting high ground in a build fight, but now you can rush people with it and fly straight above them without even building.

Also a side note, on console, when players place down jump or launch pads, your game can freeze and or your framerate can drop to like twenty. I was just in top ten with nine kills, and a player was using jump pads to get high ground on me, my framerate dropped so low it was difficult to tell what I was even seeing, it's even worse when they swing around with the grappel and spam it so they are just all over the place.",FortNiteBR

Epic made a great change to splodes by having ammo capped at a certain threshold (18 and 13 Depending on the Weapon). This was great because it meant that a player couldn’t just continuously send splodes down my way. Great. 

Unfortunately, they increased the effective Splash Radius of splodes so that ONE SPLODE will destroy a whole god damn 1x1. ONE SPLODE from an RPG can negate a double wall double ramp push.

Before they tweaked splodes, they were easily countered by building... even if the player had 70+ rockets at their disposal. Now, splodes simply destroy too much build and in some cases is literally impossible to counter since the Splash Radius destroys so many builds in quick succession.

I’m not complaining because I always die to splodes, but because I think they are objectively not balanced at the moment. This has been a problem since the beginning of Season 5 and I still see no sign of Epic adjusting the splodes to be more balanced.

My simple solution: Revert back to Pre-Season 5 Splash Radius Levels and keep the Ammo Cap where it already is right now.

What are your thoughts on the state of splodes and how do you think they should be adjusted if at all?

TL;DR: Nerf the effective Splash Radius of Splodes. ",FortNiteBR

You can test it yourself in any game by going to 10 sensitivity for your X or Y axis and flicking really fast to one side (either straight up or straight down depending on which axis is on 10 sensitivity). Now you will notice that there is not that much happening. Even if you go on a lower sensitivity you'll see for flicking, it doesn't change that much. This is because of the acceleration mechanic. It needs some time to warm up to give you the speed you want so when you're really fast (when flicking), it's gonna hold you back big time. 

Now for the real critics, you could say that the acceleration is due to your thumb going so fast. Saying it's the acceleration of your thumb and not of the games mechanics. You can disprove this by filming both your thumb and the screen. You'll see that when you go in slowmotion, your thumbs acceleration is much faster than that of the games; thefore it's the games acceleration holding you back and not your self. 

Now some people might like this but personally I would like to have the option to turn it off because I use flicking a lot for my shotgun battles and this makes it a lot more difficult to do. Also I think it gives a disadvantage against mouse and keyboard players since they can flick freely with their mouse (Deaquan is a great example).

If you're having trouble aiming and particularly in close shotgun battles recently, it's because of aim acceleration being back in the game. Epic has done this before recently but they said they overdid it and reverted it because it was such a big change for most people. I personally think that if you make major changes to the aiming mechanics you should let people have a choice. So let us have the option to turn this off please. ",FortNiteBR

It’s full of madmen who don’t even need to practice, just building like they’re KB+M, and I get humiliated whenever I die to them.

I’m very much a lurker on this community and 100% what any good player would call a noob, I don’t build and I enjoy just completing the battle pass tasks because I accept it’s unlikely if ever actually win a match!

So I started a solo game dropping at Lazy Links, I had tasks to open chests and get eliminations there so felt a good plan. No one dropped with me so no eliminations but I had freedom of all the chests.

I was in the circle and with no one around decided to mess about in a buggy (ATV?) To see how they worked and tried to rack up points for another challenge I had.  I didn’t get many before I had to move because the next circle had been picked and I had some ground to cover.

When I got to the edge of the next circle I dropped right in the middle of a gunfight between two experienced players, they were both shooting at each other from towers and I was between them.

Fortunately I had a rift to go which I hadn’t ever used before. I tried and found myself flying away to dusty divot while they crippled each other.

Amazingly there were only 8 left and no one had been in dusty at all, lots of loot to keep me entertained and despite the circle being quite small now I was left alone until I got to the buildings at the top where I was going to hang out until endgame, besides, be best I could hope for at this stage was to survive.

When I checked there was only 3 players left and being able to hear a chest I went to see what was in it in the hope the other two would take each other out, I could hear them shooting so I didn’t want any part of it.

In that chest was another rift to go, I was on the completely wrong side of the circle, and peering out the now only remaining player was building a massive fortress in the middle of the map.

I had my plan, I was going to wait until the last moment and rift to the new circle, just survive.

As I flew across the map I was spotted by the final player who launched a barrage of rockets at me, the best I could do was run from tree to tree occasionally popping bullets from my assault rifle. I’d see the odd ‘33’ appear above my opponents head, but fully expected to get a rocket to the face at any moment.

However then it happened. The storm caught him, he panicked and left his massive tower while I think I just closed my eyes and fired, it all happened so quick, then those magic words popped up.

Victory Royale.

I know this forum probably won’t care, but for me it’s a huge deal. I know I play it wrong, I don’t really play to win, but I love the game, love the people who play it, and love reading the posts on this community.

Thanks so much Epic and the people who made this such a huge hit, Fortnite isn’t a game made for me, but t certainly is enjoyed by me.",FortNiteBR

As I seen before here on reddit there is a lot of very smart and generous people that are willing to help.

Basically what I am looking for is someone to completly run me through on how to set up all the good stuff while streaming and that is: 

1. Overlay design with the last donator, last sub, last follower and webcam 
2. Create those donation to appear on stream with a text and follower and sub
3. Create some graphic designs for the descreption under twitch to look neat
4. Set up donate button and all that good stuff with it
5. Help with obs cause most of the tutorials are either very basic or outdated or very advanced
6. I play streched and would like my viewers to see it non streched
7. If you suggest anything else to add please advice or help thank you

I am willing to pay if you show me your worth and I dont expect one person to help me with anything just hoping one by one I can get it all set up good and neat to watch. I got pretty beefy computer and insane internet and live in EU also only stream in English.

Sorry if any mistakes in here using phone as I am not home right now.

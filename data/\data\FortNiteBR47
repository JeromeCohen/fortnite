For example CS:GO doesn’t get much content update or the way game changes but they update game to improve the gameplay and approach to perfection by eliminating bugs etc

Fortnite has a lot of bugs. Shouldn’t fortnite focus on removing those bugs rather than frequently adding more content, vehicles, map changes and whatnot.

What do you think?",FortNiteBR

  I have been playing the game since March 20 ONLY. Participated loads of games at any game mode except Arena mode so far and can not advance to higher levels of skills yet.

  The day before, i requested for help here and added a pal someone i do not know who definitely helped me finish the toughest Buccaneer's challenge. He turned out to be console player btw. When i saw him playing and in particular constructing numerous stuff at a time but knowingly(not randomly), my eyes almost exploded cos despite having practiced quite remarkable number of times, forget about not getting stuck inside what i build, i can not even build them swifter.

&amp;#x200B;

 On the other hand, I have been utilizing the default keys from the debut hence i literally could not specify some keys i could feel comfortable with. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I also watched many tutorial videos, read a few guides related to building and still no fucking improvement happens.

&amp;#x200B;

What shall i need to progress in this aspect of the game?  (Especially asking it to PC gamers like me due to the complication of the keys)

&amp;#x200B;

Please shoot some opinions.

Luxe and Blackheart Cup I qualified for both -- Champions League etc...wasn't able to play solos this weekend because I work some weekends. My usual partner just hasn't had the time to commit -- personal friend but I've kind of moved on. Would really like to find someone more on my level (which isn't even anything to really write home about!). 1,000+ wins, 25,000+ kills type player like myself would be awesome -- but again -- anybody that's just qualified and finds themselves in need of someone let me know. Scrim experience obviously preferred, tournament experience doubly preferred, 21+ triply preferred, but all are negotiable if you're as competitive as me and like winning. Just want to give this one legitimate go. Finished just outside the top 5% way too many times to not try over the next few weeks.

Well at least for all the pros. Epic hasn’t really been in touch with the community lately, not even a bit. They’ve sorta just been making executive decisions for the game, shutting down sensible suggestions, even from some of the most popular figures in the Fortnite community. Here’s a few examples:

1. Removal of siphon: everyone loved the system. It was balanced, rewarded players for their hard earned kills, and generally resulted in less camping. When it was removed everyone was outraged because there were no negative comments about siphon. Not from pros or casuals. But epic decided themselves that because of “unhealthy aggression”, it didn’t belong. No matter how much we complained and begged, we got no sign of it coming back, or even a response on the topic.

2. State of Ballers: Now these things aren’t even that bad, but it’s how they impact endgame situations and even mid game. In the last few circles, you’ve got about 20 kids camping in ballers to avoid having to fight and interact with other players. There aren’t any skilled fights, just players rolling around ready to jump out and one-pump anyone who approaches them. They can get around easily and shield themselves from gunfire. As unbalanced as they are, Epic has refused every suggestion to make them less overpowered, and are in fact keeping them for the the biggest competitive tournament coming up this year.

Now this isn’t a complaint post, it’s an actual question. And I’m looking to discuss it with anyone that agrees or has an idea why it’s been this way with Epic lately.",FortNiteBR

Hitting for 100 when you don't hit the person and hitting for 15 when you hit midair is kinda lame. 

 Just needs a slight rework to the damage. 
85 to the body and 15 splash if it is near the ground. That way it splashes for 15 and not 100. But if you hit somebody and they aren't in the air it would do 100 like it normally does. 

This would mean if you hit a skydiving person it wouldn't do a measly 15, it would do 85. 
And if you splashed somebody in the ground but didn't hit them, it would do only 15.

Can we have at least a reply to the community and/or a discussion telling us what was specifically bad about the pop up cup rules?

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everybody! Hello Microsoft! Hello Epic Games!

My name is Johny, I play Fortnite on Xbox One.

I very love this game and play it almost everyday since Season 2.

When they'd announced World Cup, I also wanted to take part in it, even if I clearly understand that I have so less chances against PRO players and other tough guys. But this event is highly significant and challenging for me. And I don't want to give up.

However, as I got close to champs division and amount of remain players in close range became 10-20, I just CANT PLAY!

It is simply Impossible. I got huge drops of FPS, game starts to freeze, twitch, gets stuck, etc.

So the questions is, HOW to compete in Fortnite on Console? Or you don't expect console players taking participation in big events? So, then just say to all, that events are only for PC, that would be fair.

I also want to notice that things became worse after 8.0 update and not even in mass fights but actually in any one.

I don't even talk about the old bugs you still cant fix like ""self- rotating stairs"", ""not shooting pump"", "" not rendered houses"", ""buildings not placing"" etc.

Why the game is so broken on console? Why do you have so much disrespect for us, guys?

I know lot people will say, include pro gamers like Chap, Nickmercs etc - that If you want to compete, buy a PC..But its not a cheap candy you can easily buy in a shop. Not everybody got this amount of spare money to buy if even not the decent but at least not worst pc for gaming. Especially if you got other duties and costs with ur family, pets and lifestyle..

Why can't you just optimize a game for those who just have their consoles and want if not have the best graphics or sth but simply not glitching game with stable fps! Do we ask much? Does it need much time to figure out? More than inventing new modes, planes and balls? .. :-/",FortNiteBR

I’m an admin &amp; Reddit dev. I work on a team here at Reddit that is building special features for [r/FortniteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBR). There’s something I’ve been working on that I wanted to share.

One  thing people have been telling us is that they want a way to add a personality to their presence on the subreddit. Something like a skin,  but for Reddit.

We started thinking about this, and we came up with an idea: **Badges**.

When you have a badge, it will be displayed before your username, and **your username will be distinguished** with a matching color.

[This is what badges look like on web](https://i.redd.it/2483f7umqgs21.png)

&amp;#x200B;

[And this is what they look like on mobile](https://i.redd.it/t5qeb2cuqgs21.png)

Notice the badge comes before the username, so you can still have flair on the other side.

The badges are custom designed just for this subreddit, with images, memes, and jokes that have become popular here.

https://i.redd.it/vpg1vij8rgs21.png

Some of the badges may be limited edition,  so they will only be available to the first few people who get them. In  the future, we also want to get more ideas from the community for new  badges that we can keep making.

If you are interested in badges and willing to give feedback, I’d really like to talk to you. Add me on Discord at jarins#4775, or send [/u/jarins](https://www.reddit.com/u/jarins) a PM.",FortNiteBR

Effectively you'd have arena, where you can play the game aggressively and focus on ranking up kills (pros are happy) and the normal game is a much more survival based environment where you have other strategies to win (skybases, camping, ballers,ect.)


And lets be honest, SBMM doesn't do anything to separate skill level like it's original intention was. And no one likes forced cross-platform.

So I had an idea I call it Worlds Collide LTM. This could come out a month before save the world goes free. So basically it is 96 vs 4, solid gold weapons only, respawns allowed for the 96 team. So you may think this sounds crazy ,but hear me out. So the team of 4 is as follows the mythic hero Master Grenadier Ramirez, mythic hero Mega Base Kyle, mythic hero Swordmaster Ken, and mythic hero Phase scour Jess. All 4 mythic heroes will have between 1,000-3,000 health and between 1,000-3,000 shield and could upgrade buildings which would be nerfed. 1st build phase would be the same as standard Battle Royale, 2nd building phase would double the Battle Royale building health, and phase 3 would triple the Battle Royale building health. They cannot pick up weapons ,but they spawn in with 3 weapons from save the world and have their 3 abilities as well. Each would have a ranged weapon, a close range weapon, and a melee weapon. There would be no storm ,but there will be a 45-60 minute time limit to eliminate the save the world characters and if they don’t the team of 4 would win. During this both sides would hear unique dialogue from Ray and Lars from save the world this would give Battle Royale players the chance to get introduced to these characters before they hop into save the world. Please leave feedback on how this could be improved and I know it maybe a bit overpowered ,but I wanna see what you all think and please leave feedback.",FortNiteBR

What about if when in a baller your max health went down 1 tick per second down to 50 instead of 200, and after 30 seconds outside a ball it would begin to go back up to 200 one tick per second.

This would give players mobility, but at a risk. 

Also, too all the people saying ballers are in the game for better performance, I don't know about console, but that doesn't make any sense, Epic is probably running hundreds of games on each server so they could just run less if there are performance issues, which I have never run into, even on a potato laptop.",FortNiteBR

I'm also going to include items from challenges such as Ruin and stuff from the Blackheart/Hybrid/Luxe challenges as well. Back Blings will not be included unless they are not part of a skin's set in the Battle Pass. For example, the Cobra back bling will not add any additional V-Bucks due to it being part of Sidewinder's set and if she was in the shop, she would come with this back bling but the pets, Dodger and Woodsy will be counted as 1000 V-Bucks each because Empress was also 1000 V-Bucks. Sprays and sticker emoticons will not be counted because they are filler and no one likes them. I'm going to put the calculations in a list below: 

First page: 2 legendary skins, 100 V-Bucks and a rare wrap - 4700 V-Bucks (4700 V-Bucks total)

Second page:  200 V-Bucks, a music pack, an uncommon emote and a rare glider - 1400 V-Bucks (6100 V-Bucks total)

Third page: 100 V-Bucks, a pet, and an epic skin - 2600 V-Bucks (8700 V-Bucks total) 

Fourth page: 100 V-Bucks, a rare wrap, an uncommon glider, and a rare emote - 1700 V-Bucks (10400 V-Bucks total)

Fifth page: 200 V-Bucks, a rare pickaxe, and a rare glider - 1800 V-Bucks (12200 V-Bucks total) 

Sixth page: 100 V-Bucks, a rare wrap, a rare emote and an epic skin - 2700 V-Bucks (14900 V-Bucks total)

Seventh page: 100 V-Bucks, a rare pickaxe, a music pack, and a pet - 2100 V-Bucks (17000 V-Bucks total)

Eighth page: 100 V-Bucks, a rare wrap, and a rare emote - 1200 V-Bucks (18200 V-Bucks total)

Ninth page: 100 V-Bucks and an epic skin - 1600 V-Bucks (19800 V-Bucks total)

Tenth page: 100 V-Bucks, a rare wrap, and an epic glider - 1900 V-Bucks (21700 V-Bucks total)

Eleventh page: 100 V-Bucks and an epic skin - 1600 V-Bucks (23300 V-Bucks total)

Twelfth page: 100 V-Bucks, a music pack, and an epic emote - 1100 V-Bucks (24400 V-Bucks total) 

Thirteenth page: 100 V-Bucks, a rare wrap, and a legendary skin - 2700 V-Bucks (27100 V-Bucks total)

Challenge items: Swag Smasher, Flawless, Dragon's Claw, Dragon Stance, Fierce and Ruin - An additional 6600 V-Bucks (33700 V-Bucks total)

In conclusion, the Season 8 Battle Pass is worth 33,700 V-Bucks for the low low price of 950 V-Bucks, which most of us got for free by doing 13 Overtime Challenges! Go to bed tonight knowing that you got 33,700 V-Bucks for free. Thanks, Epic! &lt;3",FortNiteBR

From my point of view of looking at things, this is not a competitive game. This is why the game isn't competitive. Fortnite can't be competitive.

This is more of a complaint rather than a discussion but anyways

I’m honestly tired of the community complaining about the removal of syphon settings. If you’re good enough at the game you’ll get used to it. That’s what being a pro is. It shouldn’t matter what the dev’s throw at you. Adapt and over come. If you want syphon settings, go to arena mode like the sweat you probably are. The normal modes have now casual and I’m honestly enjoying for it more than ever.

“YoU oNly lIKe iT bEcaUse iT fiTs yOuR gaRbAge plAyiNg stYle” 

Guess what, out of the 200 million registered users, the majority don’t have time to site there and grind out game that when it comes down to is really about chance and luck. The circles, the weapons spawns, the skill gap, even a players decisions are completely random. So sorry I don’t wear a stupid soccer skin. That’s a whole other topic I don’t want to get into. 

Anyways, I’m having a lot of fun with the game rn and my gameplay hasn’t really changed. My wins haven’t changed, my kills haven’t changed. Nothing has been different. I still carried health items during the syphon stages. 

Sometimes I want to play fortnite without not being able to see clearly because I’m none stop building with a sensitivity at max settings.",FortNiteBR

Shortly after I saw comments that ranged from mild unhappiness to people calling me a pathetic piece of shit. And why? Just because I called someone a sweat and used a stereotype. To all the people that currently want to kick my ass, if I were making fun of someone for being bad and calling them a “bot” and that they walk around the map hiding in bushes, would you hate me? I doubt it so much that unless someone can convince me otherwise my automatic response is a resounding no. You proved your toxicity for bashing me. I said that you were sweaty and didn’t have a life, and you responded with calling me a piece of shit and a pathetic waste of life.

Posted this a while back, but now I have enough karma to post it here

&amp;#x200B;

As you know, Thanos' Infinity gauntlet appeared in Fortnite. But only for a few days and only one person could become Thanos  
There should be a new limited time mode where you can BECOME the heroes and defeat Thanos (the person who has the infinity gauntlet), but he would have to have much more health than what he originally had. I think that the main Avengers should be added and you pick up one object to turn into them.

For Iron Man / Tony Stark - The Iron Man suit (cooldown for repulsor \~ 2.5 seconds) You can fly for however long you want as long as the suit doesn't 'die' (suit has a battery starting at 100% gradually goes down as you use it. Repulsors and flying make it die)

For Captain America / Steve Rogers - Captain America's Sheild before infinity war, (can be thrown up to \~ 30 meters) returns once thrown and does damage OR Captain America's Sheild after infinity war (replaces the pickaxe) mines trees much faster and does a lot of damage once hit.

For Thor - Stormbreaker, Summons lightning and does damage, if thrown, can be brought back to you without running to get it

For Hulk / Bruce Banner - Maybe somewhere where you can give yourself gamma radiation and turn into the hulk, I don't know maybe it should be like the port-a-fort where you can just summon it. Hulk breaks buildings very easily and, obviously, does a lot of damage **\[Note here: They are making a place next to Loot Lake that looks like the place where you can give yourself gamma radiation\]**

For Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff - Special dual pistols or a gun holster to avoid confusion, the same thing as dual pistols, but does more damage than the gold and faster reload

For Hawkeye / Clint Barton - A bow and some arrows **\[Another note here: they have recently added bow and arrows, so I would assume they would add more damage to them as well\]**, the arrows should be similar to the clinger, but do much more damage and further ranged (you should get 10-30 arrows, \~1.5 seconds reload)

Once everyone gets the items, they should be able to voice chat and talk to each other. Civilians (or other players) can not hurt or get hurt by the Avengers (just a suggestion)  
Maybe more characters, such as Spider-Man, Black Panther, Winter Soldier, Doctor Strange, Hawkeye, Wanda, The Guardians of the Galaxy, Loki, Vision, Captain Marvel should be added, but that would be a bit too much.

I don't think that Thanos should fight alone, so maybe they should add in the Black Order (again, just a suggestion). If adding in the Black Order is much (because they are dead in Endgame) here are some extra powers Thanos should ***definitely*** have with the infinity gauntlet

Time Stone - Reverse the time on the clock and reverse time \~2-5 usage limit up to 1 minute back in time (maybe less time or fewer usages or possibly a cooldown)

Soul Stone - Allows Thanos to see other people's POV, including the Avengers

Mind Stone - Allows Thanos to make people go on his side, but they must be on your screen, this is the only exception that civilians (normal players) can hurt the Avengers.

Space Stone - Allows Thanos to make people go someplace else, including himself, although they have to stay on your screen, and you cannot make them go into the storm or the edge

Reality Stone - Gives you any weapon you want (to give to people after they join Thanos), turn into a specific skin (making you off the radar, maybe for a specific amount of time), possibly edit how far / close the storm is or maybe choose where it would go. Maybe turn bullets into bubbles or turn people into string, like in Infinity War (for a certain amount of time, obviously)

Power Stone - Makes you similar to the purple cube (it would make sense considering the power stone and the cube were both purple), shooting you would just deflect all damage (maybe for a specific amount of time \~30 seconds?) or maybe it would be immune to all bullets except the Avengers damage?

I feel like when the first Avengers game mode was released, it seemed a bit unfair that you were forced to face off against Thanos with literally no help. This mode protects players from Thanos and, although he does have more power, the Avengers can save people and Thanos can make you join him, instead of killing you crudely.  
Who would get Victory Royale? Either Thanos' and his 'helpers' or The Avengers and everyone else who helped out. People can still kill other people, though.

This would be a really fun game mode, and a great way to wrap up Season 8. People working together to defeat Thanos, joining Thanos or becoming an Avenger, would all be a really cool experience to both fans, and non-fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

I feel like they are taking this idea into consideration (read notes), I did post it on Epic's forums back in July.",FortNiteBR

I’d say the most fun/balanced  season for me was season 4. I hop on fortnite everyday still but unlike before where I could simply play solos for hours and not get bored or frustrated, I get bored, frustrated, or both in like a half hour now regardless of the mode I play.

I really want to enjoy the game. I really want to have fun with the game. After all the time and money I’ve spent on the game, all the fun times it’s created, I really do. But I can’t. I just hate so much about current fortnite; the map, the weapons/items, the YouTubers, a big portion of the community, the skins, etc.

I really do hope season 9 is great. I’ve just never felt as disappointed and done with the game as I am with season 8. I mean, I’m not even hyped for a single update any more. (This is coming from somebody that would wake up/stay up to play the newest update every single week.)",FortNiteBR

If I get squads daily missions I just go afk or land somewhere deserted. 

But I think that locking items like the new emote on the Buccaneers Bounty event is not good. I think pretty much every player has at least 1 friend and could do it, but there's a part of the community called ""solo only players"" and we don't really play much with our friends.

I think Epic should realize they've completely flipped their game into squads only. Last time we got a solos ltm was Floor is Lava and before that was the CHRISTMAS EVENT, yes, in December.

And back to the challenges with friends when a reward requires their completion. That's just enough. I think Epic should stop doing that. I lost my chances of getting the emote, which is really cool and I'd love it as a Blackheart main, but due to this friend requirement I can't get it.",FortNiteBR

It seems like the last 30 games I have been in are scrim lobbies, yet I saw none, good players. Then I go to watch Ninja, tfue, Nick eh 30 or anyone else, and they are getting players not even close to what I get. Playing on EU is impossible since season 6 began. Also with the season 6, most people seem to be very and I mean VERY Passive, its got to the point where I will get let's say 4 kills early game, look for ppl in about 15-20 mins, finally find someone and start fighting, half of the lobby is there. Like what happened to the game, is it the removal of the bounce pad? I have no idea what the situation is on the NA servers is. Add that to my insanely bad luck in this game: i literally could land tilted alone and only find 3 minis, then get into an ar fight only hit 2 of my shots from ar becouse Bloom and get sniped by third party on a hill playing like he was in the most importand scrim of his life. Am i doing something wrong here?
To end this off i would like to share my stats for those that are wondering and those who are about to call me trash at the game:

One of my biggest pet peeves are generalizations and assumptions. Both tend to mark a weak consciousness as the person tends to blindly associate one thing with another, assuming that what they're saying has to be the case. Around here, this often manifests itself in claiming that a player someone has previously fought is a tryhard.

I'm not denying that some players do try to maintain a certain image (tfue fans only playing no skins for example) but it does annoy me when people refuse to accept that they got outplayed by someone they claim is a tryhard.

If you just got wrecked by someone who pulled off an impression swanton, why run to reddit and claim they're a tryhard? Better yet, why associate a particular skin with tryhards? I will admit that I have to stop myself from doing this sometimes, especially with soccer skins, but I think at the end of the day it comes down to seeing that generalizing is actually pretty stupid. Unless you know the person, you're just assuming things because you're butthurt.",FortNiteBR

Epic support aren't   the best at helping out and they make removing 2FA from your account a   pain by asking things that are simply just effort or you might not  even  know the answer for, such as:

\- Your public IP address (IPv4)

\- Date you created your Epic Games account

\- An invoice ID for any Epic Games purchase

\- Locations where you made purchases on the account

\- First ever display name for the account

\- Last 4 digits of the first payment card used on the account

\- Date of your last login- Names of any linked accounts to EG

They also ask for a picture of at least one of these to prove its you:

\- Passport

\- Personal identification

It would be cool if we could flip though previous battle passes on fortnite and buy teirs to get the skin but you can only flip through the season passes that  you played in and only buy the teirs. 

E.g I played in season 1 and bought every single battle pass except season 2 for some reason.

But for some one who started in season 4 they can only buy season 4, 5 not 3 or 2 

It a win win players who played in a certain season can finally buy it and you get more money.

Being invisible in a shooting game is just pathetic, you’re a billion dollar company but can’t afford to use some test servers and have a dedicated team to testing new content before release.

I remember the days when I was awful at the game. I couldn’t get a kill, building was an unknown thing, but by god I loved the game. Season 3 rolls around and I start getting better and begin to enjoy the game even more. Season 4 I had a blast playing and was the peak of how much I enjoyed the game. Season 5 and I started to lose some interest in the game because of how the meta had changed, the terrible theme/story, and the annoyance of how BR games work. Now season six, I have lost all interest in playing the game. Building is out of control, shooting is basically 2nd hand, the amount of 3rd partying is insane, the amount of stuff they are adding in the game is ridiculous, and I just can’t seem to really get into the “themes” anymore. The game today doesn’t feel anything like it used to  when I truly enjoyed playing it. It’s turned into something I dread playing when my friends invite me. I can’t exactly put my finger on it but I think it’s the constant change/adaptations to completely new things that completely change game play (builder pro, hop rocks, map changes, adding/removing guns, shadow stones, etc). I really had wished Epic Games would’ve made smaller changes to improve quality of gameplay and fix the bugs in the game rather than change the game completely to keep it “fresh”.  This is more of a vent but I needed to post it somewhere. Anyways, have a nice night. ",FortNiteBR

And as a result of this, volcanoes will form along the cracks once the pieces of land merge back together. Maybe Kevin will head back to Loot Lake and fall back into its place and ignite this “earthquake” shift.

I’m not sure if that makes sense but that’s as best as I can explain it.

240,Surperian03,1538701567,9lhsnm,90,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9lhsnm/the_bomber_and_greed/,1,The Bomber and Greed,"We’ve known for quite a while that the Dark Bomber was coming. She was teased in Season 5 for gods sake, she is basically the mascot of Season 6. Something we also saw in Season 5 was the addition of the Tomato Skins’ unlockable styles. A lot of us believed that the Dark Bomber would be the same: an unlockable style

_So why isn’t she?_

Epic is smart. Let’s get that out of the way. After all, they were the brainchild of the Battle Pass system(I know they didn’t create it, but they both popularized it and improved on it). So why wouldn’t they?

It’s obvious; greed. Now, let me make something very clear: I don’t hate Epic Games. From what I’ve seen, their employees are amazing and interact with the community regularly. They repay you V-bucks if wrongly banned or have trouble getting into your account due to them. That is something most companies wouldn’t do.
However, it’s obvious that they know Fortnite is stagnant. It’s not dying, but the fan base is growing less and less, and we will hit the fall around the beginning of 2019. To me at least, it seems like they are desperately trying to milk as much money as possible.

Now, I know a lot of you are asking why this matters. Of course they’ll try to, it’s good business strategy. That’s true. However, what this is is selling the same product but tweaked for the same price. The Thunder Crash and Dark Bomber are replicas of Brite Bomber and Rainbow Smash. This is something I’d expect from EA, not Epic Games.

Like I said, I don’t hate Epic. But these practices are beginning to degrade my opinion of the company. I know that at this point it’s irreversible, but it’s still a warning sign to me that they will keep rehashing skins for max profit and lowest effort.

FINAL REMINDER: I don’t hate any specific Epic employee. They’ve been nothing but kind and respectable to the community. It’s the company and it’s recent practices I don’t like.",FortNiteBR

Within just the first week of Season 6, we’ve had a floating island fly across the map towards a glowing rune in the ground, it then proceeded to pull the rune out of ground meanwhile activating purple craters in the ground that launches players. This won’t be the first time though, we have five more of these events to happen.

Not only that, but there are now purple cubes growing inside the Loot Lake house at a rapid pace everyday. Who knows what they mean, but it’s something to be excited about.

One of my favorite parts is that Halloween decorations have been popping everywhere across the map. It really changes the ambiance of the game and makes things fun and interesting.

We have already gotten a new trap in the game (rip bouncers tho) + some awesome playground options people have been asking for a while. 

Don’t forget about an amazing battlepass with some of the best skins the game has seen.

And of course we are about to receive Dark Bomber later today, and who knows what interesting things we will learn about that new character.

It's cross platform, it's free, and it's suitable for essentially all ages (doesn't mean it's fun for all ages, just suitable). I am a PUBG guy, now, if you haven't played PUBG: \*Positioning is key\*. You have to have a good position at all times, you have to thoroughly plan where you go, before you go there. You have to stay a certain distance from your teammates at all times, so as to not blow both of your cover, should you be shot at. Upon trying to apply skill, logic, and genuine military tactics to Fortnite: I was met with people that (from where i'm standing) Just spam down walls, and ramps. Now, this doesn't completely take away from the positioning aspect of Battle Royale games (That should always be present, in my opinion) but it does damn-near enough damage to tactical play, that positioning means very little, apart from where you land (which because of the insane distance you can glide, is essentially anywhere across the map). I don't want building removed, because then, I believe that Epic could be in real trouble with people like PUBG Corp. as their games would be too similar. Most of the time I play solos, I come at least top 5 (which is alright, but it's not 1st) and about 60% of the time, I come second. The reason for this is because during the final few minutes when there are a few players left, I can use my knowledge of high ground \*don't try it Anakin\* and other genuine tactics, to kill off many of the remaining players. However, when it comes to the last player, I always, always lose. Firstly, they can see round corners (not just Fortnite, this is an issue with most Battle Royales, although PUBG does have a FPP mode) So positioning yourself in an advantageous way can prove very difficult, as your enemy always knows where you are for the most part. When it comes to the shooting, I am good at that, since there is very little recoil or changes in bullet velocity; but as soon as I get close to the final man \*wall\* \*wall-ramp-ramp-ceiling-wall-wall\* and then I am trapped. All that work, for nothing. Yes, I could've done that first, and I am sure that the only advice I will be given is to ""Try and further your building skills"". Which Is all when and good, but I don't really know how. I would love some genuine help, but also, feel free to comment ""git gud"" and the like, if you are a small child who can't bring them-self to write a praiseworthy insult.",FortNiteBR

Why don't we just increase the damage of the pump slightly to make it better for general use while not having the ability shot people, just enough to get them to really low health.

Change the green pump from 80 to 85 and the blue one from 85 to 90 and tweak the critical head shot damage to under 200 still. (let's say 185-190 max critical damage where all pellets hit the head for example)

This could help the pump have a small buff again without any borderline game breaking mechanics.

Sure it is not a ""double pump"", but it is a better solution that will be welcomed by all parties at least.

We mentioned in the August [State of Development](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-august-2018) blog that we’ve been working towards adding sub-region matchmaking. We enabled this feature for the Asian region in September and have just recently also added it to both Europe and NA-East. Follow the link above for all the technical details and read more below for additional information.

 

**What’s sub-region matchmaking?**

This is a new feature we’ve implemented that will find the data-centers that are available in your region, determine which one provides you the healthiest connection, then place you in a queue that is pinged to that location to give you the best available connection. Depending on your location, players will experience varying improvements to their ping and other network related performance.

 

When will this feature be implemented?

As of September 10, we launched the Singapore data-center and implemented the logic that allows for Sub-Region Matchmaking. More recently we also added both Europe and NA-East to regions that use this functionality.

 

**Will I always connect to the closest sub-region?**

No. Not in cases where the player population for any given platform/playlist combination is not sufficient to guarantee a reasonable matchmaking queue time. In cases like this players will be defaulted back to the “primary” data-center for the region for that match. So you may notice a difference in your in-match network conditions if you ping better to ""Location A"" than ""Location B"" depending on the time of day you’re playing, the platform you play on, and the playlist you select. We will be monitoring this feature closely and make adjustments as we find the right balance between network performance and match wait times.

**What if I'm in a party?**

When in a party, if you are in a region where Sub-Region Matchmaking is supported, it will prioritize the location of whoever the party leader is.

**What are our goals?**

Our final vision and goal for sub-region matchmaking is to allow players for each region to automatically connect to the data-center which offer them the best possible network experience.

 

As we expand this functionality to other regions, we will be able to both provide significantly better service to underserved areas as well as optimize the experience for players in regions which already operate out of multiple geographically distributed data-centers. We’ll continue to determine which regions would best benefit from additional data-centers and keep you updated on these new locations as we add them.

 

Please continue giving us your feedback on this feature and let us know what you think!",FortNiteBR

1st Battle Pass for me, and I was thinking how much gameplay does it need to reach **Tier 100**. So here it goes...

to reach **Tier 100** we need **1000 Battle Stars**.

every **Weekly challenge** gives 50 Battle Stars  x  10 weeks  = **500 Battle Stars (50 Tiers)**

every **Daily challenge** gives 5 Battle Stars  x  7 days = 35 Battle Stars per week  x 10 weeks = **350 Battle Stars (35 Tiers)**

So far we have 85 Tiers out of the 100 Tiers but just doing all weekly and daily challenges. Not so bad :)

We just need to ""grind"" 150 Battle Stars (15 Tiers) ... but it is not all from the XP that you get from playing.

I believe that we get **500XP per Daily Challenge** and **5000XP from completing 4 out of 7** weekly challenges and also by leveling up.

From every level 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 you get 2 Battle Stars; level 5 gives 5 Battle Stars and level 10 gives 10 Battle Stars, so every **10 levels we get 31 Battle Stars** which translate to 3 Tiers. If we need 15 tiers , this means that by reaching **level 50 we get the remaining 15 Tiers to get to Tier 100.**

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said before, this is my 1st time in a battle pass, and I'm not sure if this Math is correct. please le t me know if I missed something.

Thanks to all.",FortNiteBR

I'm just gonna hop straight to the reasons i feel this way. 
1. I feel the core gameplay has been toyed with too much. The introduction of grapplers and bouncers and shadow stones radically changed meta and introduced new bugs. Personally I think epic already has enough to fix, (invisible character models, issues with rendering,  seemingly random damage output) and changing the core mechanics of the game only adds new bugs that they have to fix. An example of this is the shadow stones, which have been out of the game for most of the season due to it breaking the game. I feel they should focus on fixing what they already have and work towards a full release of the game.

2. I believe the concept for the new season is a joke. I like the idea of the map being alive, but loot lake island just flying around the map willy nilly? It seems sort of pointless and stupid to me. 

3. The community. Mostly the children. Clickbait, scams, and cancerous cringey YouTube personalities thrive off the naive nature of the kids that play this game. Squad filling is pointless now, since 90% of the time you get placed with someone who's toxic or deaf and mute. 50 v 50 is full of team killing and griefing, this alongside poor performance on consoles makes 50 v 50 basically unplayable for ps4 and xbox players.

I really want to love this game again but it's really hard in its current state. I doubt epic will abandon its money making corporate ways to focus on making a quality video game, but god damnit I'm not gonna lose hope.

&amp;#x200B;

RNG. Bloom. Whatever you want to call it. Not looting, that's customary for battle royale and it is what makes it thrilling.

&amp;#x200B;

Build, build, build... yup. Enough of that. Why this game is slowly declining? Because at some level all this game really is... is chance. No balance. I can build up, outplay my opponent, edit peek him, etc... only to have none of my shots hit. Let alone barrel stuff him with DB and not get any consistent numbers. The fact that the most random weapon spread and shooting system was introduced into such a wonderful game will always be the downfall of it sadly. To be honest, I wish Epic did not choose to lengthen the FSA. It was helpful to at least be rewarded with tap firing quickly in succession and hitting your shots. Yet still, enemies get away simply because you cannot trust your shot. (The amount of times I have given up on tap firing because it is to slow, and straight unloaded from a crouch and landed complete random headshots, or on the other side of the coin, no shots at all...) Instead, the Fortnite game will always be known as a push and build towards your opponent to see whose shotgun spread lands best. The only thing that feels anything smooth is SMG at close range. More of than not I choose that these days because I can steadily aim it. Let's put it this way... when you hit a noscope back in the day, holy cow, that meant so much more than watching someone hit one in a game like this. Someone hits one and all you can conclude is that it was complete randomness. Every time I land a musket shot like that I am left with a feeling of, ""welp, that worked out..."" instead of pride in accurately aiming and eliminating your opponent.

&amp;#x200B;

I will keep playing, winning, outplaying, or honestly, even getting outplayed myself, yet their shot does low damage and I get bailed out by a sub-par shooting mechanic. Why does Fortnite seem to make people rage more than any other game ever? My guess, because you can do everything RIGHT only to get screwed by the game playing against you. It is simply why competitive Fortnite isn't really competitive. Mastery of building is barely a skill, that's like saying super-jumping in halo 2 was a skill. 2 good players go against one another, 9/10 the player who initially had the high ground is keeping it. It's not hard to memorize where your keys are and hold down left click and point your mouse around ""with control."" Go into playground for an hour, you'll come out on the other side of it with the ability to build pretty well.

&amp;#x200B;

I will definitely still be enjoying this game on occassion, because man it runs smooth, but after a year of Fortnite and with some new shooters emerging in the battle royale genre, it will be far less. Maybe that's because I grew up on a different set of games, but I know the people working on the game are relatively my age and should know better than to *build* a game around ""bloom."" For now, I will still enjoying building, because it truly is fun. But come end of the year, I don't know where this game will sit in my list.

&amp;#x200B;

I have spent a lot on the game in both time and money, I have played every season and enjoyed it a lot, until season 5. Epic I am perplexed and confused by what direction you choose to drive the game and the influence making these decisions. Season 5 has introduced heavily hated things such as a nerf in material, nerf to the pump shotgun, removal of double shotguns and the introduction of the most infamous drum gun and  smg ( especially the P90). I love this game however I feel it is inevitable the game will die if crucial parts of are not changed. I pray you value my opinion and hear what I have to say, buff material and bring back double shotguns. Although the hated smg and lmg will still be there the introduction of a strong counter like double shotguns will even this power gap in weapons. The pump shotgun also needs a vital buff as I and many others feel the weapon has been spoilt by the various reworks. Epic hear my cry and even for a second consider what I’m proposing and I guarantee the game will continue to move forward in an upward direction. Thank you.

For a company with such a successful game, the support response from Epic is incredibly slow, as with many big gaming companies a change is desperately needed.

An example of this is my boyfriends account. His account was disabled after he traveled from Canada to Switzerland to visit me during my studies, one of our favorite pastimes is playing Fortnite together. Only 1 week into his visit and his account gets this mysterious disable. No cheating. No fraud. No intentional request to disable his account. Only reason I can think of is either his account was hacked (but he had 2-step authentication?) and it should notify him and so I doubt this was the case. It seems more of a random ban due to his travel. He has sent in a ticket but had no trace of fixing his issue, just placement of his request and the back of a very long line, with the response mentioning it being disabled due to suspicious activity and that's all. This issue seems like it should be easily fixable (flip of a switch maybe)? During this time he lost 2 weeks of the previous battle pass (which I see as a loss of the V-Bucks he spent on the pass) and a week and a half of the new season and can't purchase this seasons battle pass, completely killing his hype.

If people are able to bypass that authentication and someone did hijack his account, then at least the response time should be faster to fix issues like this is the security of the accounts are not up to par. I've read similar cases from people not getting responses in weeks to more than a month, epic closing a support ticket and stating the reason as no response received even when a response was given, and other demoralizing stories. The speed and overall performance of the support staff is abysmal.

I suggest adding a queued chat, or a phone number or at least more people on there team to make this more of an efficient process it's just so painful to go through currently. This turned into more of a rant post, when I was aiming for more of a critical angle but it's incredibly frustrating to get such little care from the support team, especially when the game is doing so well.

- Buff Pump shotguns by reverting it to the original base damage while keeping the 2x head shot multiplier.
- Double Barrel Shotguns should get a 2.5x head shot multiplier so it can one shot easily while increasing fire rate and decreasing reload speed and accuracy slightly
- Tactical Shotguns should get 5+ more damage and a slight increase of accuracy for a slightly slower reload speed
- Heavy shotguns should have 6+ more damage so it can one shot players.

RIFLES

- Change scoped AR head shot multiplier to 2.5x
- Increase thermal scoped AR damage by 3
- Decrease SCAR damage fall off range slightly
- Increase Suppressed SCAR damage fall off range slightly.

SMGs

- Replace SMG with Tactical SMG (because SMG looks lame in my opinion)
- Tactical SMG should stay at its late season 4 state
- Compact SMG should have a slightly higher fire rate than Tactical SMG by one or two

SNIPERS

- Regular Snipers should be hit scan which won't be a big problem.
- Heavy Snipers should get +10 more damage but and should have the same bullet drop off as the Regular Sniper Rifles now
- Hunting rifles should have less bullet drop off like the heavy sniper
- Semi auto is cool

PISTOLS

- Desert Eagles just need an increased range for damage fall off like maybe 75m or 100m
- Please bring back revolvers an have an increased range for damage fall off (same as Desert Eagle)

Explosives are in an good state right now.

Grapplers aren't hard to counter. Just be better lol

2. %Chance of a temporary damage increase OR damage reduction buff consumable.
3. %Chance of a revive stone (bring back a player who is dead or consume to give yourself a second life(buff last x seconds) and second life if buff is consumed or second life of revived player lasts X seconds.

Players with 5 or more kills:

1. %Chance of items above except slightly buffed.

Players with 10 or more kills:

1. %Chance of items above except majorly buffed.
2. %Chance Buffed versions of existing guns which eventually 'expire' to their normal form.

I believe the core of the problem of the 'kill incentive' directly conflicts with a BR game. Epic tried out-of-game incentives like money and points. I'm arguing here that Epic could add in-game incentives to spice up the game and stick to the spirit of BR while proving real advantages to aggressive players thus making the viewing experience more exciting. Also would have an added benefit of reducing the number of players in end game circles alleviating some of the technical challenges epic hasn't been able to solve yet.

 I purposely tried to leave lots of room for balancing in these suggestions ( X Shield, X Dmg buff/debuff, X time alive from revive stone, X or more kills -&gt; stronger buffs for X time. ) etc etc",FortNiteBR

in now days..if you run this gun...and you got into 1 or 2 tile range with your enemy...you better hope he does not have a god dam double barrel...yes even the purple one will stomp on this gun.

and you might ask..what about combo..well...do you have 150 hp or 200? if so..then you maybe have A chance..but..you cant miss..cause the MOMENT you miss..you are back to the lobby.....what if you dont have 150 hp or 200? better pray he is trash at aiming...and suck with luck...cause you gonna die....very fast... even hitting all shot

2.close to medium range.

....seriouslly just go get a pump and smg or dual pistol or what ever ..you will be 1000% more effective with the combo then this tickle gun...

Add gifting but only for friends and only 1 gift per day. 

Make the weapon damage for all weapons lower so that people have better chances to win against pros. 

Make different kinds of pistols like glocks, and other guns.

It was released alongside a whole slew of other Halloween themed cosmetic items during October of last year. Unfortunately for newer players, the Skull Trooper skin has not been available for purchase since then, which has in turn made the Skull Trooper one of the rarest skins in the popular battle royale game.

With Season 6 of Fortnite taking place right through Halloween of 2018, players have begun to speculate that Epic Games could possibly be bringing the rare outfit back to the daily item shop around Halloween, as the title is gearing up for a Halloween theme with decorations and other spooky items making an appearance on the map lately.

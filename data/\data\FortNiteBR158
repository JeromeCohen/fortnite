Reason A) the battlepass. I don’t get to play daily and haven’t even gotten into the 80s with weeks 1-7 complete. It stresses me out to know I won’t max my BP. Reason B) I suck. I practice a lot in playground and real matches but never seem to improve. I’ve played since December and I hardly ever win. My stats are as follows: Solo-15 wins Duo-15 and Squads-24. Reason C) challenges seem to be a chore. So in conclusion I feel like quitting but don’t want to because I’ve spent hundreds of hours and dollars on this game. This is no way a rant against Fortnite. I love the game and encourage people to play it but I’m not improving and I feel like quitting. What should I do? ,FortNiteBR

Don’t get me wrong. I understand their choices in removing it. I’ve accepted that. What’s below is my thoughts on why I believe it still deserves to stay in the game.

1: The Bouncer was a tool used for getting higher ground, faster movement, and for a unique edge when it came to fights. It brought a new effect of having to face opponents moving differently, bouncing up rather than simply (what we currently have) generic “you build up, i stop you, i build up, you stop me” non stop. Obviously they were a Rare item and it wasn’t too common to affect fights in a way where it’s what you’re expecting. The bouncer was an extremely unique item and when it was released, players loved it! Even up to the date of its vaulting in the 6.0 update, people were still having fun and doing new things.

2: Brings me to my next point. The Bouncer was a favourite item. Who wasn’t happy walking into a room and finding 3 bouncers? The game was in a decent state, mind SMGs and the current meta being not exactly fan favourites. This item was always something I was happy to see in my inventory and have the option to work with! Bouncers had so much potential from what they already were! Players were continuing to find new uses and keep having fun with them, for multiple purposes. 

3: The bouncers fit with the game’s state right now. As of recently, things have been getting added, all contributing to faster travel. Balloons, Rifts/Rift-To-Go’s, Quadcrashers, etc. Originally, Chillers, what were to be the replacement to bouncers, we found made it possible for us to travel faster using them. This was insanely convenient for our community, but with all these new items, are Chillers relevant? Who needs to waste materials to set up chillers and move a certain distance when within sight distance is almost always a rift, or an area full of shadow stones? When almost always, there’s a method of getting place to place that is easily accessible. Chillers don’t fit in anymore and they aren’t anything that can compare to what the bouncer was. 

4: The vast majority of the player base would take Bouncers over Chillers, easily. This isn’t a guess based on my opinion. It’s fact. I’ve talked to so many players, and they can all agree that the Chiller does not have a place in the game. Bouncers added unique new fighting and movement options, while Chillers brought a now obsolete method of transport. 

Other items that were vaulted

LMG: Players loved it while others hated it. It only contributed to an already insanely high powered spray meta. 
Silenced SMG: Again, players hated, players loved. A personal favourite of mine, yet some people thought it was an eyesore just being in their inventory. With the state of items and what the game was, it really didn’t fit in anymore, and that was understood. 
C4: Remote Explosives for a short time we’re the most powerful item in the game. After a series of debuffs and changes, these became shadowed by better items moving in.

The Bouncer doesn’t possess the quality of opinions and causing a fuss these others did. Nobody, if few, people complained about them and at this point, their “replacement” in Chillers doesn’t seem to provide a helpful, unique, fun item that the Bouncers did. 

Obviously people will have opinions. I’m positive there will be comments stating me otherwise. Give some proof. Prove me wrong. I am absolutely open to discussion if you think otherwise, but these are my thoughts and you can interpret them as you please. 

TL;DR The bouncers belong back in the game and chillers just do not live up to what the bouncers were.",FortNiteBR

""I'm sick of all the building in the game"".

To play a game all the time for six to twelve months, and then all of a sudden stop because of all the building seems to be a real issue here.

Does Epic realize that a lot of players are leaving because of all this over building now?

With the amount of revenue this game has generated (especially considering there's not much overhead or cost for what they're returning), why is it we are still so limited on our game modes?

It seriously baffles me that Halo 5, which probably has less than 10% of the amount of active players as Fortnite, has both competitive and casual sets of playlists with 7-10 game modes in each playlist but Fortnite is somehow completely limited to 6 overall?

Maybe there's something I don't know and I'm just being ignorant but I feel like with how successful this game is that we should be able to have a competitive and casual playlist with even just solo, duo, squad and 2 LTM's in each. I don't think it's much to ask but then again what do I know. 

TLDR; Fortnite has made over $1b, we should have more than 6 game modes. ",FortNiteBR

* Does the turret damage need to be adjusted in any way?
* Is the weapon balanced in comparison to other weapons and defensive building?
* Does this weapon deserve to stay or should it be removed completely?
* Is there anything about the turret that should remain un-adjusted?

The point of every battle royale is for the competitors to survive, not to rack up kills. The way it is now only the crazy suicidal maniac types of players get rewarded/noticed and not the low-key calculating players. I think it should be about the victory royale and top placement, and high kill counts left to being optional, like how Fortnite used to be when it first became popular. ",FortNiteBR

When the bus started, the three immediately decided to mark Tilted as the landing spot. I, not wanting a death wish because of my sub par skills, suggested landing somewhere further from the bus, only to be chastised by the other three calling me a “noob” because I didn’t want to land at Tilted.

I didn’t bother jumping with them and I made the right call because the three immediately went down and died before I even landed. The three simply threw a few insults at me before leaving.

This whole thing led me to wonder why this community primarily frowns upon non-aggression when it comes to playing this game. It’s a BATTLE ROYALE, last man/team wins, why must I greatly decrease my chances of winning by getting into fights I don’t have to? The amount sweaty players and tryhards have only gotten worse with time because they care more about getting high kill counts and flex their building skills rather than actually winning. 

So what if I stealthily observe two other players build battling instead of joining in? I’m only making it harder on myself by running the risk of getting double teamed by two players when I can just finish off the last player while he’s damaged and trying to loot.

I hope I’m not the only one who has this mindset of preferring to surviving rather than trying to actively hunt other players down.",FortNiteBR

I hopped into a squad fill game, went Salty, landed on a house with one. She got the gun, and I had to escape. I could only place a wall. She knocked me out anyways. If she had just finished me off, I would have forgotten it and moved on. But she did the Disco Fever for a couple of seconds before finishing me off. Just because you got the gun first doesn’t mean you’re better.

Later on, I ran into one on PG fill. Was a complete sweat, although I did kill her a couple of times.

In conclusion, I despise her, and killing her in a match makes me very happy. They’re all a bunch of sweats.

I’ve had better experiences with goddamn Rust Lords than with Bunny Brawlers. I’ve only ever seen one do the Take The L, and that was in the lobby. All the other ones I ran into seemed to prefer the Best Mates. One even gave me shields.

My brother.


I looked at my fellow merman about to kill my teammate, and thats where I faced the most important decision in my life.

Spare my brother or betray my team.

I pulled the trigger and his moisty body hit the floor, he crawled for his team but I knew their help would come to late. His teammates killed my team, so i did what I had to do.


It broke my heart to put that bullet in his head.

Since auto aim slows down my reticle even without aiming I can’t hit quick shots to the head because it locks on the body. I’d like an option to turn off auto aim while not actively aiming down sights. Also I’d like to turn off auto aim on snipers and the hunting rifle for precise and quick aiming. Lastly those of us with sprint by default on and jump binded to the left stick should be able to auto run and glide with a new bind.

For the most part, I always get it done day one, but I haven't had a chance to get past stage two on the challenge, meanwhile I finished all the rest.",FortNiteBR

\-Add Zombie (Cube Fiend) Spawners too haunted hills, first off I know zombies are kind-of a sore spot for many players but I think the concept truly brought some new much needed spice too FNBR yes they shouldn't be everywhere and sure as hell shouldn't be anywhere near the end game matches... however I choose too look at it from the perspective of when everyone landed looted up a bit and finished the early game skirmish we would take the time too farm zombies, eliminate the spawners and continue with rotations. Taking a page out of BLACKOUTS book adding a specific area (in this situation haunted being the perfect choice) would not only change up rotations and strategies in a positive and healthy way while once again continuing with the theme, cutting away RNG factors from the game in a natural way. The North-West corner of the map has been pretty lackluster as of late and adding zombies too that area would give it the unique life it so desperately needs.

IN SUMMARY

My Current feelings and opinions on the needed changes too the game too significantly crush RNG and One-Track-Mind play-styles and options in the game... with some, or all of these changes both the skill ceiling would be raised as well as the skill floor being lowered the barrier of entry being cut in half

while allowing truly exceptional players both mechanically and mentally too dominate their foes with variety and endlessly dynamically supported strategy. I don't claim too be a super intelligent player who knows the code of this game in and out who can explain too you how the inner-workings of every available mechanic

in the game works. HOWEVER I am someone who has been playing this game for a VERY, very long time, humble beginnings playing save the world.. transitioning too battle royale when it was released from the early rough and rugged Pre-season Era (Season 1).. To the infamous season two map change and overall refinement

of the base game, fast forward too presemt day with season 6 the game has changed so much in many ways positive and equally as many negative, so using even a few of these ideas as a baseline for more intelligent people too push Fortnite in the right direction I truly believe Fortnite has much more time being

the top game ahead of itself.",FortNiteBR

No interesting update of the map.
Still no Playground update.
No particular event.
Food Fight and Far West LTM are quickly annoying.

The turret is still in a shitty state.
The dynamite is way too OP for its rarity.

What the hell were they thinking for this week ? Seriously. I usually don't complain but this week is legitimately annoying.

I will only play in order to get Tier 100 and for the Weeklies. Otherwise I probably won't play until next update hoping it will get better.",FortNiteBR

Especially when I've got more than enough normal games. Last season, that's all I spammed on the side while having 1.5k total matches of normal games. 

Disco Domination the respawn kind of ruin the fun.. barely anyone plays the objective. Food Fight, is too small it was fun first few time and it got absolutely stale after. Wild West? Lmao, who actually even plays that? Props to you whoever enjoys it..

I really enjoyed Team Terror because it felt like 50s again, but with Zombies. I liked the teamwork in that game mode and when you had 5-6 kills, you made a huge difference for your team. I never seen so many people grouping together too.

I miss dancing with ally team mates, ressing people, crawling to the no skins for resses in 50s. And especially being the last few alive neck to neck in numbers of people. That was definitely really fun.

I'm just amazed how people actually enjoy Disco. It teaches you legit almost nothing. And when you do challenges, you HAVE to play the full duration and can't go jump off a cliff because you'll repsawn. Just seeing people do challenges together in 50s was so nice.

I just wish Soaring 50s would come back soon. It's the only game mode that makes me actually have fun in during when its time was around :/ I don't wanna jump into a solo, it's BORING as hell. And I don't wanna fill for Duo/Squad because you know the outcomes of it mostly..

I think that if you weren’t able to complete the Omega or Carbide skin in season 4, you should be able to complete it now either in terms of experience (like the new BP skins) or in terms of challenges (like skulltrooper and tomatohead variants). I really like the way Omega looks but since I didn’t hit level 80, I have no lights and it makes it look ugly. I hope epic can make this change because I know I’m not in the same boat and I know some people might disagree with this because they grinded to actually get the variant. Either way, thanks for reading.

TLDR: Epic should add a way to get the Omega and Carbide skin upgrades for those who didn’t get to complete the skin.",FortNiteBR

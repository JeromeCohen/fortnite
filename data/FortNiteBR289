Now i know im late because i REBOUGHT the battle pass on switch 7  days ago after the ps4/sony stupidity and i planned on buying the last few tiers to unlock everything and i grinded my ass off ever since to get to level 80. Turms out ot damn near impossible for people with anytype of life.

I am a kid (14) on summer break so youd think id have the time to no life fortnite and get them levels quick right? Not only do i have a whole big family to spend time with during summer, Well it turns out its litterally impossible at this point because level 65 is barely even halfway to level 80.  And im level 58. Im buy the last 13 tiers for omega so the new weekly turn to exp so i can max carvide but this is absurd. I wanted to be able to switch between omega and carbide armour and colors because i love them both but no. Omega fully upgraded is out of my reach.

Epic has to add something to help us Dedicated fans out. Like a triple exp boost or lowering omegas levels to 70 (probrally wont happen), let use buy exp boost that can stack  or  something. but i cant be the only one tilted at this, For at least 93% of the total fortnite players wont have max omega.  Epic plz do something.  I really want green omega.

Personally, building is important in battle royale but suspect shooting is more important :). Playing a solo last night and down to last 2. One of these was a great builder and the other one was me.

Had 200 health which went to 50....I was constantly firing and made sure I was on top of them so they had to be in the box with me :)…. suffice to say I won but would love to know how they build those boxes and set traps so fast on console.

Have been trying to think of some fun things to do in Playground beside building and came up with The Great Llama Hunt.

Pretty simple really, whoever kills most of the 100 Llamas on the map wins, you're allowed to do whatever it takes to secure the Llama, be it bullet or Pickaxe, if you need to kill other players to slow them down then do so. It's not the fatest pace of games, but once you get a few launchpads up around the map you move around pretty quickly. Helping you secure more Llamas.

My take on this though is that I want my channel to grow and become big so I can show case smaller streamers, but instead of just posting their clip or multiple clips of random people who just send stuff in, I want to have a legit (time-stamped in description section) showcase where amongst popular streamers like Ninja etc. I want to have one clip from a smaller streamer and make a big deal about it other than it being just some random clip. 

(The channel is only here to promote youtubers and twitch streamers, none of the content is in no way owned by me, I just take the time out of my day to go through clips, compile them and make a montage for people who don't have time to sit and watch streams for hours to enjoy, but I want to add us smaller people into the mix too in hopes of gaining people exposure into this game.)

That's the bigger picture though, I'm here to drive traffic to my youtube channel, I looked at what bigger channels that showcase fortnite streamers and emulated their title style and stuff. I don't know if their giveaways are real or not though, Mine are. and it will stay that way each 1k subs I will do a 1,000 v-buck giveaway. I just ask for a like a sub and comment. ESPECIALLY if you are from here let me know in the comments you came from here that would be the best.  I want to give proof that my giveaways are legit so when I send the money will you please screenshot and post!  Either way though I'm going to have a section in my description showing all winners who ever won my giveaways as proof.

If you took the time to read this and you don't care, thank you for taking the time to atleast read this. If you do sub, like, and comment I hope to see you in the giveaway.

So watching the Playground trailer ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk3QVVARBgU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk3QVVARBgU)) I found some interesting things to screenshot.

[An area that seems to be based off Egyptian pyramids and a Sphinx.](https://i.redd.it/s32vui0m0t711.png)

[A Castle \(possibly part of a kingdom\).](https://i.redd.it/hu3pasfx0t711.png)

[A western town and people about to do a gun showdown.](https://i.redd.it/v62bodb31t711.png)

Now I guess if people are skeptical of the theme being history then here is some more evidence to change your minds.

There were already some news about map changes including pyramids and a western town. Maybe this is epic dropping hints? All and all I just want to talk about the season 5 stuff before I leave. There have been so many posts about tomato head being gone with the portal rift being near it. I feel like if something new and exciting happens during season 4 which is linked to season 5 then yeah, people should have their fun for a couple of hours then if it gets out of hand with lots of posts then it should be taken care of by mods. It's only really been like this tomato head and I feel like this'll happen more during the next weeks. So if you check new posts by any chance, don't get repeated posts to the top.

Another idea. Look at the 50v50 trailer. Build 2 castles/forts and at the 30 minute mark (or whatever your time choice is) you fight.

Turns out, he killed me 6x before I even got him down 2 health. And he was being nice and letting me get equivalent weapons before we fought again.

He killed me with a pump, 3 Snipes, an SMG and a drum. I had purple SMG, blue tac shotty, orange dual pistols, blue assault and full shields every time. So it's not like Bloom was messing with me.

I know that controller versus keyboard have long been seen as uneven but damn I had no idea it was this bad. It made me feel better about always seeming to get one shotted in the head while I seem to rarely do better than body/neck shots.

I don't think there's really a solution here except to either switch to PC playing or somehow setup a kb&amp;m for PS4.

Anyone else discovering this in Playground as well?",FortNiteBR

Even 13 rockets results in 13 bases completely vanished. When fighting someone with an RPG, what you used to do is take the high ground by building, but now there is just no way. I just got out of a 1v2 where one of them had an RPG. He just spammed his 13 rockets, and I had literally no way to turn to offense from defense. After spending 1000+ mats I still had low ground and no chance of winning the fight, thus the game. I'd rather have a guy spam 60 rockets at me than 13 with this power.

This dude spams me with grenade launcher, so naturally I run towards him because I have no mats, and of course one nade 15 feet away kills me. I check his health. 2 hp. I immediately durned off the pc and stormed off. I swear the range on rockets is just a little much. Like I have no mats because the last 5 people I killed didn’t have any.

I'm a very good builder and it's frustrating.,"So I have been playing Fortnite battle royale for a long while now since the end of season 2. I have 799 games of solos and only sometimes play other gamemodes. , I use every tip in the book, I get headshots all the time with shotguns, and never get the type of damage I see elsewhere. 80 damage, 40 damage. I know in a build fight when to back off, I know every push technique possible (ramp wall, ramp, side wall turn etc.) , and I can 1x1 tower about half as fast as Myth (not a joke). It annoys the shit out of me because I can get one shot by a pump, when mine does 80 damage to the face. I use rotation techniques at times, go to the narrowest part of the circle, if I can get my hands on launchers I use them, and most likely get sniped by a Fortnite **god** whilst I jump out of my three story tower in mid air!!!! Please help me in getting better at this game. If you can help me improve, and move on to getting my very first solo win, I would love you forever. **My in game name is C0ld\_FN with a zero and if you add me I would love some 1v1/2v1 practice in playground mode** (with a much more experienced player ofc.)",FortNiteBR

the cracked sky is a time portal, season 5 will start with a desert map, which represents the ancient egypt, and this map is going to change like the season 1-4 map (It won't be useable anymore) The map will get every 4 weeks a huge update, first it's the acient egypt desing, then it's a roman desing and in the last 2 weeks it will have a Middle Ages design.

The are some ""new"" 3D models inside the data, which represents desert theme items, they aren't included inside the new map, they will appear in the last 4 days of season 4 inside retail row.

The battlepass will get a huge rework as well, 200 instead of 100 items, every item doubled except spray emotes, due to a new kind of reward (Hats for skins).

You won't be able to buy all stages at the first day, the first 65 stages are desert themed (You can buy them in the first 4 weeks)

as soon as the roman map is active you are able to buy the next 65 stages (roman themed)

And in the last 2 1/2 weeks of the season you can buy the last 70 stages (middle ages + Renaissance themed)

(You won't be able to unlock the stages as well as long as it's not updated)

They last 2 1/2 weeks of the season includes new kind of missions so it's easier to earn battle stars.

0. Customizable Settings -
This is the ground work for playground v2, players being able to have settings for playground will make the game all the better. 

1. Llama Loot -
Llamas should be giving max of all resources since it is already so easy to do so. 

2. Edit Storm Times -
Have a setting where we can choose how much time before the storm closes in. Also the addition of a normal match with 4 people would be awesome also. Max time should be 2 hours although because of server stress. 

3. Respawn Loot -
A group vote setting where we should be able to choose if we respawn with we our original loot we died with. 

4. Increased Ammo and Special Build Drops -
Have ammunition and special building items drop more often.

5. (BIG) Increase Playground Party Size -
As we know at the moment the playground capacity is 4 people, our friend groups however, are larger than 4 people. Increasing party size would make the game more fun! 

6. An Invincibility Mode -
For building, having an invincibility mode would be incredibly useful. I say the group should vote on if invincibly can be used and turned off DURING the game. 

7. Choice of Editing Others Builds -
A problem we have is that we can edit our friends builds when battling each other, we should be able to turn this on or off in settings. 

8. Player Join and Leave -
In playground, if a player leaves the game ends, which can be annoying if someone’s internet goes out or their game crashes. Also, since playground isn’t a normal game, we should be able to join the game when others are in already. 

9. Loot Spawn Settings -
Settings to change the percentage of a certain rarity of weapon or item dropping from ground loot or chests. ",FortNiteBR

[Concept video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO7cgaDiB84&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I'm gonna start out by saying I already love playground. This is a great mode that is loads of fun with friends, however, it has some issues most people will agree can ruin the fun. For example, being able to edit you friends building in build battles, desperately searching for items you need, running out of mats when doing a large scale build are all common complains I have seen and experienced. Many people have complained and just asked for the option, but very few have suggested how to implement the options menu.

I, however, have created a concept that will perfectly add the option menu to the game and smoothly transition from game play to settings. [I even created a concept video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO7cgaDiB84&amp;feature=youtu.be)

My idea is fairly simple. All players will spawn with a trap in the shape of a handheld phone. When placed, a menu will pop up allowing you to select multiple options such as get max mats, unlimited ammo, gravity sliders, setting  your spawn location, and many more.

People play playground for a variety of reasons and I feel that this menu will help out every type of player. If you want to have a build battle with your friends, set your health and shields to max, spawn the guns you want, max mats, and disable editing friends structures. If you would like to build to your hearts content set unlimited mats and disable falling damage. Setting your spawn point will automatically spawn you at that location without having to drop in, saving about 2-10 minutes of just dropping in from the sky depending on how you play the mode. An option to keep your inventory after you die would be perfect for build battling as well.

Possibilities for movie making is limitless as well, and with EPIC's recent interest in movie making with replayroyale and the new blockbuster contest, I feel playground should be the goto place to create films with friends. I included a time of day changer in my concept to make sure the mood and lighting is always right in films, however much more could be done. For example, EPIC could add exclusive animations such as throwing, flying, dying, slow walking, peeking around corners. 

I would like to remind you playground is amazing, however, I would love to see this added as I honestly believe it would improve reputability immensely. Thank you for reading my thoughts and I hope if anyone at EPIC reads this you take my ideas into consideration. ",FortNiteBR

Now that playground is here new players can practice building, explore the map, and skrim with friends. Making Playground mode a permanent mode would ensure that people new to the game could get better at building more efficiently than just practicing building in Wailing during a solo game or other LTM.
     New players can learn the layouts of different named locations. They can figure out chest locations and parts of the map they might favor most. They can plan out their own map rotations and gain knowledge of the whole map. 
     One of the best ways to get better in any 1v1 situation is to put yourself in one. Skriming with a friend would better your building, gun play, and ability to out play others. Learning those skills could help you get that victory royale or just better your own playing.
     The best way to help new players and even current players is to give them a way to practice. Many other games have their own practice modes were you can play with friends and have fun or practice sertain rudiments in that game.

We all knew it wasn’t going to be up when they said it would however I think they surprised everyone when it released last night. I’ve already spent many hours in the mode playing 1v1s with friends. The mode has certainly opened up a new dynamic of Fortnite that will keep the game fresh and interesting. 

With all that said I would like to share a few of my ideas that if implemented, would truly heighten the experience of the playground mode. 

1. A spawn in menu
Currently 1v1 is all rng right now. If a menu was created to spawn in say two bolt action snipers, people would easily be able to have a sniper 1v1 instead of spending 5-10 minutes going through hella chests to find two snipers. It would also greatly expand the creative capacity as players wouldn’t spend the good part of their hour searching for items to build in their creation (bouncers, launch pads, etc.) Overall, the creative menu will induce more creativity and ideas than already is floating around this subreddit. It will certainly help 1v1 in later stages as there is no loot to be found in some POIs after a couple of fights. 

2. 100% Chest Spawns
Kinda of going off the previous point, loot gets stale after a couple of fights and with every possible chest spawning in the map, this will certainly delay that point in the fight from happening. Also, this would help in an educational way helping new players learn all the chest spawn locations and introducing more statistics about the game such as say the chances of getting a certain weapon out of a chest, how many legendary drops on average come out a chest in a match, most efficient loot routes backed by data, and much much more. This will lead into a new understanding of the game’s loot system and increase the number of fights in an area. 

3. An Option Menu
There should be a menu that has a bunch of settings able to be turned on and off or adjusted. One could be how much shield you spawn with. Another could be “keep inventory” to allow for more standardized fights. There could be an option for how long respawns take. As of right now you can edit everyone’s structures which is not the case in an actual fight in BR so maybe there could be a setting where you can’t edit other players builds. There are many more options I’m sure EPIC and the community could come up with that would enhance this game mode. This settings menu would allow for a much greater customization of everyone’s game and greatly change how the mode and fights are played out.

Once again, thank you EPIC for creating an amazing game millions enjoy and come back to each and every day. The playground mode was an awesome addition to an already amazing game that will keep players coming back. 

These were just a few suggestions I believe would help the game mode turn tap into its full potential. 

Sorry for formatting and autocorrect. I typed this up on mobile lol. 

Tl:dr- Suggestions for playground: creative menu for spawning in items, 100% chance for all chest spawns, and a settings menu that greatly affects gameplay. ",FortNiteBR

We were trying to do the 500m shot, but its not possible because the bullets hit you but they dont do any damage even if they hit your head. So I think 485 may be the max because I tried to move like 2m further and the bullets from my friend stoppe doing damage to me.  I leave a screenshot so you can see its true :D

I know I could wait for it to be free because it's supposed to be free in 2018 but I can't wait, mostly because I have my son for half the summer vacations, we love to play fortniteBR together and it would be the greatest gift of all for him, and I would enjoy it a lot too of course. We spend so much time together on BR when we're appart. If I could afford it I wouldn't ask you and I would pay for it but I'm really really short on money and it's too expensive for me.

So if someone has a code a feels generous and comprehensive I would appreciate it a LOT ! It would make my son so happy and me by the same time. It would be such a great gift !  

Thanks for reading and I really hope someone is generous enough to give us access to THE game we love the most and enjoy our vacation together even more.",FortNiteBR

It is demonstrated in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC39ZPsdS88&amp;feature=youtu.be) where I show and explain how to do it in detail.

You always end up in the same spot, no matter from where you do the glitch. I even tried building up to the sky limit, but still the same result. This could be very useful for looting until the last possible moment and then instantly teleporting to the zone (Salty Springs is near the center of the map and will therefor often be in the circle)",FortNiteBR

- Consoles get an additional disadvantage at not being able to change resolutions.

- There's a major quality downgrade that scales proportionally with the aspect ratio the resolution you set has, leaving players to a dilemma, whether they want visual fidelity or a competitive advantage.

- There is no limitation as long as you don't mind weird aspect ratios, giving a questionable advantage to those with bigger monitors.

It was a great way to quickly disengage / jump down from a too high buildfight. In scrims if i had bouncers, i would actually build fight, since if we got shotgun i would survive.

* asterisk With the change to maze it now contains fences for metal, floor for brick and bushes for wood. You are able to get 2000+ materials just from the maze alone.

* asterisk Within the bunker contains several rifts ideal for a long distance circle or to disengage.

* asterisk  Shadow Stones spawn along with three chests just outside of Maze ideal to sneak up onto opponents in Maze or houses.

* asterisk Last of all, you still have the rock farm to rotate to after walling woods, allowing you to get maximum materials without a issue.

Combat Controls:

Left d-pad—Jump (bound to left paddle)
Right d-pad—Switch Mode (bound to right paddle)
L3–Interact
Circle—Edit
X—Sprint

Build Controls:

Left d-pad—Jump (bound to left paddle)
Right d-pad—Switch Mode (bound to right paddle)
L3—Trap Picker/Place/Interact
Circle—Edit
Square—Rotate/Repair
X—Change Material
R3–Crouch

Benefits:

-Instant edit is separate from switch mode
-Ability to crouch while in build mode
-Pick up items without letting go of either stick
-Place traps without letting go of either stick
-Change materials without touching the d-pad
-Rotate ramps on accident no more
-Still able to auto-run by double tapping X

I feel like that the majority of the famous competitive players are very toxic when they talk about other players in their games. Everyone who manages to kill guys like Ninja, Tfue, Nick Eh 30, TG etc. is either a stream sniper, trash, sweaty, a bot or even a noob. They never admit that they engaged a squad which played better than them. Also Nick Eh just said one guy is a weiney because he finished his squad mate instantly. It's not like those guys are finishing everybody instantly as well... The thing is that this behavior does not concern me on a personal level. I rarely play the game and mostly watch competitive games, but I think they should be a lot nicer to the people they are playing against instead of calling them out on stream and downplaying other player's abilities. I also think this toxic behavior by the ""big guys"" is not a good example for younger kids who are watching them. What are your thoughts about this?",FortniteCompetitive

I feel like it was snuck into the game without any prior warning and it's currently allowing players who maybe don't have a solid grasp on build mechanics to just grapple double barrel (the double barrel is it's own problem, but one step at a time) their way to kills they wouldn't have ever gotten before it's introduction.

The context here - I've played a lot of team sports, and I've read a lot about team dynamics in the workplace. There are a lot of similarities. One seminal piece of research on this is the Google research on team dynamics - ([link](https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/google-spent-years-studying-effective-teams-this-single-quality-contributed-most-to-their-success.html)). This piece, to summarize, says that the common thing among high-performing teams is psychological safety - that is, in their words, ""great teams thrive on trust"". People need to feel comfortable to be successful, to feel able to take risks, and to feel happy. In playing team sports, as well, in my experience there is nothing more debilitating to a team than a high performer that acts negatively towards their teammates. Think of a player rolling their eyes when someone drops a pass, or throwing their hands up in their air. There is no easier way to erode confidence.

In short, I've noticed this with Ninja consistently when he's teamed with players other than Tfue and Cloak. I think it's something he needs to work on, and it's frustrating to watch.",FortniteCompetitive

Imo it is incredibly frustrating to play against, especially when you know that 1 shot will kill you if you are just within a 1x1 range.

It‘s not a viable playstyle to just carry RPG for close quarters engagement, I get that, yet if I don‘t have shields and the other guy just blasts me with his 13 rockets that destroy all my cover each time it is just not fun, especially when he manages to hit me with the edge of a blast radius and kill me. You don‘t even have to aim with an RPG, it is 100% accurate while jumping and has a huge blast radius that doesn‘t fall off in damage.

In my opinion, it needs a change. Either a blastradius adjustment so center explosion does more damage, less AOE structure nuking, or (my favorite) a significant accuracy punishment while jumping/moving.

I agree wholeheartedly that it is a fantastic idea, and one I would love to see implemented. But there is no way the servers will be able to handle that kind of sever load in the late game of a competitive match.

&amp;#x200B;

I think even if there was only 20 people left in the final circle (which lately its been 60), that would still be too much of a load for the servers to handle. Imagine if a player gets a double kill with an RPG and now 100-300 mats have to instantly convert over from one player to another; the sever strain would be so intense I would not be surprised if it actually disconnected some players altogether. Now imagine if 5 players all die within 1 second of each other to 3 or 4 different people (which is surprisingly common), we could be talking about literally hundreds of mats converting instantly.

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to see that change too! I really would! But I think as a community we need to take into account the practicality of an idea, and I truly do not believe adding even more strain onto the servers is the right direction for this game. If Epic can ever get the severs perfected (which realistically might take another 1-3 years, though I'm sure they'll improve drastically during that time) then yes, this would be a great change. But for now, please, please, please Epic, don't make the servers have to endure more strain than they already do!",FortniteCompetitive

Come to think of it, I can't think of a good reason why you *shouldn't* own the structures of those you kill.  

\- If they have a large base or tarp or something, it incentivizes killing them in order to inherit those important structures and use them to your own benefit.  

\- It ameliorates the issue of third parties having way too big of an advantage in fights, because if you are able to edit out of your recently killed opponent's structures you have a better fighting chance. In addition, if your build fight is getting knocked down, you have a higher chance of being able to place a bounce pad on one of the structures if you can place traps on every build within the build fight.  

I am genuinely curious to see if anyone has grievances with this change - I believe it would be a step in the right direction for competitive Fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

This mode is like walk in the park, 10k+ games are very common, my yesterday's record is 22k.. However no matter how many kills I get every match i just can't win a damn game.. i think I only won one 

I can live with epic forcing squad on me, i just pick no fill.. however playing against squads where everyone has this cancerous jetpack and grappling hook is just fucking impossible.. i don't care how fucking good you are you can't win against 4 jetpacks and grappling hooks and DB.. and combine that with trashy audio (which thank god is getting fixed finally)


I just don't know how to react with full half decent squad rushing at me from every damn direction, my response is to build ""fuck off"" high, because being on the low ground end exposing head hitbox against jetpack is a bad idea in my book

 and when on the high ground, pick them one by one, however it's impossible against grappling hook, even if i'm above them, they can just just use grapple..

Remove the headshot multiplier and reduce max damage to 125.

With how wide the DB spread is the only way to get a max damage 125 thunk will be to basically ram the barrel down your opponents throat. I believe this will make it so skilled players are doing around 60-100 damage per shot, so still allowing that 2 shot kill potential if you're a talented player, and less talented players will only be getting around 60 damage per shot.

• Many people are suggesting way too large of a kill incentive. Camping happens, in higher level games, but the only place where it’s really bad is extremely high level games, where people take advantage of almost every mistake a player makes. The Victory Royale should always be the most important. I’ve seen the same argument presented over and over again that if Player A gets 2 kills per match and wins 5/5 matches and Player B gets 5 kills per match but loses all of them, then why should Player A do better in the ranked system ( a bit extreme, but this exact scenario was laid out earlier by someone else suggesting a ranked mode). In this scenario, Player A is the better player. If player A can win and be the last man standing 5 solo games in a row, he is by far better than someone who can have a decent match at Pleasant or Retail and choke the rest of the match. I’m not saying that the person who wins is always the best player in the lobby but if you can consistently place first, than you deserve to be higher in the ranked system. Which leads me in to my second point.

 • A lot of players in this subreddit complain about being forced to play a certain way. If Epic adds a huge kill incentive, it would force players to play a certain way, when being aggressive isn’t the best option for your game. It’s up to YOU to decide if taking a fight is worth the damage you take, and the ammo and mats you use are worth the loot the guy drops. (Again, I’m not talking about professional play, I’m talking about a hypothetical ranked mode.) The biggest tell of how good of a player you are is consistency. A ton of RNG affects high kill games, and a ranked system that rewards an RNG play style is worse than one that can 
Consistently see someone placing high and winning games, taking the necessary fights they need to win the game.

I have other issues with some people’s ranked ideas, but some of them are issues I don’t know how to fix ( high queue times) or complicated enough that even though I have an opinion on it, I’m not informed enough to pitch in on it. 

Anyways, that’s where I’m at in this whole Ranked Mode discussion, let me know (respectfully) if you disagree or if I was unclear on something.

165,DChenEX1,1537842844,9iocji,22,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9iocji/the_analogy_of_fortnite_fights_and_poker/,52,The analogy of Fortnite fights and Poker,"If you compare Fortnite battles with Poker rounds, it's dramatically clear why kill rewards should be introduced in Fortnite. 

There is obviously a problem in competitive Fortnite at the moment where players are not incentivized enough for taking fights in the mid game. Even with considerable out of game bonuses such as kills counting for points and money, players would rather save their mats and wait till the final circles to play aggressively and third party for kills. One could argue that the last Fall Skirmish didn't reward enough points for kills, but there was still a 50,000 dollar bonus for the team with the most kills in every game. Plenty of incentive for players to hunt for kills. However, engaging fights mid game decreases your chances for surviving till late game and that deters fighting.

Now take the analogy of a poker game. Poker is a game or RNG much like Fortnite. Where a player is given the hands they are dealt and have to use their money/resources effectively to maximize their profit. 

Let's say 2 players are having a build battle in Fortnite. They were given starting loot/shields and materials largely due to their landing location and storm circle. One player could have been given better RNG with their loot and mats than the other player. In the case of the analogy, one player was dealt a full house and the other was dealt a single pair.

If either of the players engages in the fight, they are effectively raising the bet by using ammo and materials that they are given at the start. The Challenger can either choose to call the play by engaging themselves, raise the bid by investing more ammo and resources, fold and disengage, or even all in with everything they have.

The analogy works well because neither player knows what the other player's situation is much like in poker. They might be challenging a fight that they can't actually win. The first player might actually be bluffing about their strengths. Or they can both be on even playing grounds starting the fight. But the point is, that each player is betting some of their resources to in order to possibly gain an advantage.

However this is where the analogy breaks down, and where Fortnite is having trouble encouraging players to fight in the mid game. At the end of a fight, there is a Victor and a loser. One player elminates the other. They gather the remaining bounty that the player left behind, but where did his initial investment go?

All the ammo, mats, and hp that both players used within the fight basically disappear from the game. Every resource you put into the fight is not replaced and it turns out, the house wins everytime. That is the inherent problem with mid game fights in Fortnite, players are not rewarded for using their hands correctly and out playing an opponent. It doesn't make you more likely to win the game if you win a fight, it makes it less likely.

An in game system that rewards players with something they've invested into the fight will make fighting worth it. Wether it be home/shields, mats, ammo, that is rewarded the instant you kill a player or team. What do you guys think?",FortniteCompetitive

If the downed player from ""Team B"" gets killed from ""Team C"" **while he is still down**, then ""Team C"" will get the kill. But, if ""Team A"" still spectated, they would get the kill.  


So who should take the kill? Since every kill counts, especially in formats like ""Hold the Throne"" or for points, Epic should come up with a solution.

So Vivid makes a very good point. ALSO while writing this I was watching Nates strim and apparently https://clips.twitch.tv/SparklyLightAppleTakeNRG 

The point in case is that Epic is punishing Funk over a mistake of their own. It's like a bad dream. 

That entire tournament was comprimsed due to Epics mistake. Anyone could of done what Funk was doing.

Literally ANYONE. 

This was not malicious. Funk made a mistake that is borderline organic thought in nature for pro like him in that situation. Let's be real Funk had got to be top 3 Humble streamers in the game. This dude wouldnt harm a Llama. To punish him for 2 months and also punish Nate for 2 weeks. Is Mind boggling.

Epic needs to come forward and make a statement. In the meantime literally everyone should boycott Epics stream, and watch Nate or Dae's viewing party instead.

But how could we improve it?

As Parallax mentioned a few days ago, more of a kill incentive is obviously needed to stop campy camping, or at least limit it to a sensible amount. As he said, kills should be the main way to score points and win tournaments, with a victory royale or second place just adding on to this. People might say that this is against what a BR should be, but as we can see that would just end up with a 129864 player heal-off. FUN!

Another idea, that I guess a few people might agree with but has about a 0.0001% chance of happening: An arena/squad vs squad mode (yes its been mentioned before, thanks I guess).

This would work as follows:

The Map: There could be multiple maps, for example Tilted Towers, Lucky Landing but bigger, Paradise Palms, etc. They would be small, but not too small, so the round is more open. It could also have a storm round it as a barrier to keep everyone in.

Scoring: Fairly intuitive, whoever gets the most kills wins the round. It could be first to 10 rounds, or something like that. You win by either killing more members of the other team, or if it comes to it, high-ground wins (open to ideas on that lol).

Guns/Eliminating RNG: A money system would work well in this scenario. You could start with say, £100, enough to buy a trap/bouncer, grey AR and Tac shotgun or something similar. You would start with 500/500/500 mats, and gain extra mats (200/200/200) for the next game if you get a kill. Ammo would be cheap, but not too cheap, to stop spam meta which we all love ofc :) . There would also be a small amount of money per round to buy ammo for weapons. You would gain money in the next round for kills, but there would be a twist: Killing someone on a 10 kill streak would give you more money to spend than someone who is 0-10. This would mean comebacks are always possible.

Epic could (if they actually do this) add playlists for it into the main game, and it would be easier to maintain: the same updates as BR, but maybe less frequent, every month for example.

What does everyone think??????

tl;dr - Instead of a BR as competitive, have a deathmatch format, which would be MUCH more interesting than heal-offs. Or just make wins and placement less important in br.",FortniteCompetitive

Aim assist is a crucial part of almost all console FPS games (the Close quarters - ultra competitive R6 Seige being the only exception I know) for a long time, because aiming with a thumbstick is near impossible otherwise.

Recently, however, there has been somewhat of a movement against console players being able to use aim assist in competitive Fortnite tournament due to the strength of aim assist. This issue really seemed to blow up when Obey Upshall released [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyNqt2lk588) of a high kill solo vs squad win vs PC players and a [follow up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPvlWnmdcMM) explaining how he was able to aim so well with an AR. With console players shining in tournaments recently many PC players feel that console players shouldn't be allowed the advantage of aim assist if they want to play competitively.

I've been asking a lot of competitive players this on stream and the response has been pretty varied, but there have been 4 main answers answers:

Yes

No

Console and PC should have separate tournaments

Remove Auto rotation (the mechanic which drags the crosshair to the player when ADSing creating this ADS spam method of aiming)

Currently, this game has no progression.  The game will die when the novelty wears off unless they add meaningful progression which it appears they are doing with showdown royale.

Ranked systems work based on MMR (matchmaking rating) that goes up or down when you lose, and the volatility of the rating decreases over time as the system becomes more certain of a player's positioning.  I know a ton of people's heads seem to explode at any discussion of ranked so let's clear some things up.

1.  How will MMR possibly work with 100 people?

This is the same argument that happened years ago when League/MOBAs were deciding how to do ranked systems and esports were transitioning away from RTS (aka sc2 aka a 1v1 game).  People thought ""how will any system possibly measure individual skill when a player is only 20% of a team?"" and created fantasies like ELO hell, etc.  Turns out, whether you win a 5v5 game is still largely dependent on player skill, so pretty much the only adjustment needed was a more lenient MMR volatility.  The same thing is going to happen with BR, whether you ""win"" or lose (over a suitable amount of games) will largely be determined by skill; the extra volatility in BR comes from the elements of luck FN includes because of some wonky game design.

2.  Wins/Kills should give x points/multiplier/anything talking about points in relation to ranked playlist

This section only applies if Epic is smart and releases a full on ranked playlist, not some bullshit play 90 games in 2 days or not have ranked for another 5 months mode.

There are no random ""points"" or raw additions/subtractions in good ranked systems that aren't based on wins or losses.  You gain or lose MMR purely based on wins and losses, full stop.  If it makes people feel better, kills could slightly affect MMR like PUBG, but the effect would have to be tiny to avoid inflation or encouraging gameplay against the spirit of BR (just smorcing anyone you see).

MMR systems generally work the best when win conditions are linked closely to performance.  This is the natural challenge of BR.  In a lobby, the winrate is 1%.  How can we get to a system where 50% of the lobby wins/loses?  This is where Epic needs to make some tough decisions.  The simplest (and most likely, most closely representing the goal of BR) is to use placements.


With placements, there is an obvious issue if you just give everyone who is top 50 a win and everyone below top 50 a loss: no one will care about anything after the first 5 minutes.  A potential solution is to change the measurement used to determine gain/loss margins.  Normally, the average MMR of your opponents is used to determine if you gain a lot of mmr or barely any.  In Fortnite, a potential solution is to use the margin of your victory/loss (how high or low you placed) instead of the MMR of your opponents.  This assumes the game's playerbase is healthy enough to create games where matchmaking is fair which should be possible for the foreseeable future.

3.  People will just camp and games will be very boring

Not much ranked design can do to change this.  Fundamentally, BR is about survival and being the last man standing.  If you find slow games of positioning/building boring, then Fortnite (at least at a competitive level) is not for you.  You can already see in competitive (tournaments, snipes, etc.) that the higher the number of skilled players, the more ""campy"" the games get.  This is only going to become more and more common when the average skill of the playerbase improves and an ELO system is introduced.  If you prefer a BR where you can just focus on gunplay, PUBG or Blackout will probably be more up your alley.

This is potentially damaging for the future of the game if the casual core playerbase of the game finds games to be boring.  However, the solution to this problem is to focus game design on encouraging more fast paced playstyles (if this is the direction Epic wants to go in), not create arbitrary win conditions that will not work with an ELO system (a far more important hurdle for creating a sustainable game).  You could write another annoying wall of text all about how to tweak Fortnite to encourage more fights rather than turtling, but ultimately I think Fortnite is an ok state right now with regards to balance between aggro and defensive strats.

4.  Matchmaking times will be long, how will there possibly be enough skilled players online at any given time?

Even in a game with much a more more developed, meritocratic esports system, League still makes challenger matchmaking work.  Pretty much this just shows that people underestimate how many people play this game and how few players you need to have a functioning matchmaking system.  SC2 has less than half a million players, yet GM level players can consistently get decent matches even at off peak hours.  Obviously, at the extreme top, the system will start to not work as well, but that is going to happen with any ranked system.  

This is already way too long, I'll add more if I see anything else worth talking about.  If you actually read this far, I'm surprised and thanks for reading.

As competitive Fortnite is still in its infancy, the path to pro is still pretty unclear and new opportunities come out incredibly often.

I would like to gather players together in order to make the West scene feel more like a community for those who haven’t made it into the procord (hell I don’t even know if the procord is like a community because I haven’t made it yet). Would love to spread the news about any opportunities (stuff like Junior Rogue) and any important news that may not be that accessible or that you might have missed. Since NA West has a much less clear path to procord, east having FNPL tournaments and the sort, I think that this would be an especially good thing for our region.

Also with the TwitchCon LAN coming up I figure more West players may go then East out of convenience so maybe we could help each other out in the lead up to that. Not really sure how, maybe have active snipes since FNPL is mainly dead on West and people don’t really play seriously? A hub for scrim starts and how to play smarter in a competitive environment? Just throwing out ideas.

This idea could easily apply to other regions but I’m NA West myself so I’m sticking to what I know best I suppose.

I've lurked a lot of videos, guides, etc ever since I returned to Fortnite a few weeks ago. Just this week I've been spending at least an hour in playground a day practicing building, and I've gone from not being able to build 180's/90's to somewhat being able to!

(PLACEMENT)
100-21 = no points
20-10 = 2 points 
9-5 = 3 points
4-2 = 4 points
Victory = 5 points

(KILLS)
Kill = 1 point
After 6 kills = each kill is doubled

You get into a lobby with 100 people and play a set of three matches. When the three matches are over it will average your points from the three games. Whatever your average is is your actually final score for that ranked match.


Example Match: 
1st Game: 2 kills-15th place
(4 POINTS TOTAL)
2nd Game: 4 kills-80th place (4 POINTS TOTAL)
3rd Game: 1 kill-11th place
(3 POINTS TOTAL)

FINAL AVERAGE SCORE:
3.6

You have to get more than 2  points to increase your rank. 
So if you average 1.4 points then you rank goes down by  0.6. If you average 4.1 your rank goes up by 2.1.

I haven’t thought of a way to do ranks, but maybe something like Overwatch.
BRONZE
SILVER
GOLD
PLATINUM
DIAMOND
MASTERS
GRANDMASTERS
AND SHOW THE TOP 500 PLAYERS

Maybe you have to play a certain amount of games to qualify to rank. I’m not sure about that last part though.

I tried to put more value in kills than placement, because in my opinion kills take more skill and more risk than surviving and hiding from others. The summer skirmish PAX was a good example of people just going for placement. There were 30+ people in final circles and I think it was because kills didn’t give you enough points to risk your whole game by dying.

Let my know what you think of this system or changes you would make to it.

Don't forget to comment on possible solutions but also other problems.

1.- An accurate point system: If you want a truly competitive experience you need a balanced point system, since this a BR is hard to develop an accurate algorithm, because if you only gain point for wins it would be extremely annoying to play since everyone is camping, if the algorithm instead give you points just for kills it is not going to be accurate since BR is a wheel of fortune in early game and people that play most at the end can have a lot of kills just by playing. Fortnite tracker algorithm is pretty interesting but it's not an accurate gauge of a player's skill.

2.- Multi-account: In Fortnite at the moment is legal to have multi accounts. Smurf is going to be one of the most annoying things out there since most of the people care about wins they will start smurfing a lot because winning will be so easy in ranks such as bronze/silver (as for example). 

3.- Matchmaking : Just remember that this is a 100 player game in low ranks maybe would be easy to find a game, but in high ranks it would be almost impossible to have a 100 player game, just see high player base games like LoL, people on the highest rank have to wait for between 10 - 15 mins to find a game and the game just need to match 10 players.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, there are more points that due to the nature of the Battle Royale make it very difficult to have a ranked system. I will love a competitive experience like you guys but remember that we need to look deep into the nature of the game before pressing Epic.

Mainly because I’ve always been obsessed with technique and tactics. I use to marvel at how Alexander used his phalanx in battle. Obsess over old war documentaries. Then that translated to gaming and I’ve always be my teams “leader”, making comms, etc. so it was pretty well established that Cloak’s comms are either the best, or tied for the best, in the game when I first got into “comp Fortnite” back during week 2 of Friday Fortnites.

Now, sure, this post is to praise Dennis a little, but I want the compliments to go beyond that as well. 

Many might remember when Ninja agreed to [finally] do scrims, and he played alongside Cloak, Tfue and KingRichard. Super fun night. Well, many might recall that at the beginning of their run, Ninja asked basically “who are some of the best teams, who do we need to watch out for”. Without much hesitation, Cloak responds the Liquid boys and the Ghost boys.

I just saw that great post someone had on here that had the list of people with the most comp wins so far and the other post about the top 20 from SS. Both lists are littered with Liquid and Ghost. 

So I think it further validates Cloak’s Fortnite IQ, AND praises the Liquid and Ghost boys.

Anyways just thought I share that thought since I just had that memory “light bulb” go off in my head.

Some of us have had the practice from other shooters and are genuinely used to high sense aiming. I've personally being using max since end of season 1, the other day I turned it down to 8 and it felt clunky and restrictive. 

Use what you thinks best for your game but dont tell other people they suck for using a higher sensitivity then you. ",FortniteCompetitive

Fortnite NA players based on their Summer Skirmish performances starting from Week 2 up to Week 8.

So for the rankings it will be based on a point system, which doubles points for solo weeks such as week 2 and week 8.  
POINT SYSTEM:  
BEING IN TOP 20 AWARDS 1 EXTRA POINT  
BEING IN TOP 10 AWARDS 1 EXTRA POINT FOR EACH RANK  
BEING IN TOP 5 AWARDS 1 EXTRA POINT FOR EACH RANK  
NOTE: POINTS DO STACK, SO GETTING 10TH PLACE AWARDS 2 POINTS TOTAL, AND GETTING FIFTH AWARDS 8 POINTS WHILE THE WINNERS GETS 12 POINTS.  
NOTE THIS IS FOR NORTH AMERICA ONLY JUST TO TEST HOW RANKINGS COME OUT AND HOW ACCURATE THEY ARE. IN A DUO EACH MEMBER RECEIVES ALL THE POINTS  


FOR LENGTH PURPOSES ONLY TOP 10 ARE LISTED, EVEN THOUGH TOP 20 DO RECEIVE POINTS WHEN FINAL RANKINGS ARE CALCULATED

Conclusion: While this ranking system and final rankings are intriguing and interesting, **I am in no way saying these are the official and only rankings of players, and players who aren't on this list aren't the best.** Fortnite is such a subjective game ranking wise. **These rankings are only to recap the Summer Skirmish and aren't even perfect for that.** The rankings are only to an overall view of the Summer Skirmish, nothing else.

For context, I'm sitting at around 45 solo wins, with an overall of 200 wins in 6000 games. 

I'm not very good but I am getting better. My building is quite good, and I can outbuild or match the building speed of various players in pubs.

The one thing I struggle with is AR aim, better shotgun shots and peeking. Oh god, peeking kills me.

So I can take high ground on a not very good player. Obviously not 10 stories high - just enough to get a good angle. However, people just drop down and hide, which us quite annoying. Spray, break walls, replace, edit, pump, repeat.

Now some guy might just hide behind cover (a good distance away where a pump does 3), peek and shoot. I don't know how to shoot him, because either I am spamming walls to stop him from breaking through my cover, or I get dinked trying to peek his ridiculous spray.

Should I crouch on my ramp, then peek while crouching, or peek by uncrouching, or uncrouch  while fully under cover and peek, or what?

Also the bots that just wait for you to peek and try and jumping headshot you from low ground are also really difficult to counter. How do I peek someone like that? They just headshot you every time you try and peek. I don't know how to kill such people efficiently.

(Note: My sniper peeking sucks as well, and I need more practice. Any tips would be appreciated. I usually play on 150 ping as well due to the region I live in.)",FortniteCompetitive

For example,  I used to play at 1440x1080, but now I've changed it 2560x1920. This removed the blur you typically see from lower resolutions while maintaining the 4:3 aspect ratio. This works, even if your monitor is technically incapable of displaying the res. This might cause slightly decreased frames because of the higher resolution, but it will not make a significant difference and helps you get the benefits of stretched (FOV) without the cons (blur). This might also allow you to play the more stretched resolutions, like 1154x1080 without the blur that seriously affects longer-range fights.",FortniteCompetitive

In the start of the stream of the NA Fall Skirmish stream there's was a part of the rule explanation that  annoyed me. When talking about how theres an extra chance for points for the people that get the most kills the casters mention both Aydan and NickMercs.

https://clips.twitch.tv/ColdbloodedConfidentWeaselPermaSmug

With Aydan it makes a lot of sense, he fragged out in every game expect the last one and had the second most kills in the whole event.
But there was 18 players with more eliminations than NickMercs and 8 of them were below him in the leader board, there was also 7 with the same amount of eliminations but because he is a popular streamer he is immediately the one who benefits from it the most. Morgausse who WON the last event had more than DOUBLE Nicks eliminations and he wasn't even mentioned. C9 Blind got the same amount of kills in 1 game, which he also won, as Nick did in 7. It's so disgusting that after a tournament the players that get hyped up and don't perform still outshine the players that absolutely killed it in the tournament.

This post isn't meant to take away from Nicks level of play, he played well, but you cant argue that he played better than enough people to be name drop worthy in the context that he was.

Also it's likely that the intro was scripted so not going after Falloutt unless it actually was just off the top of his head.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm either fighting a try hard and then suddenly someone decides to third party and of the 2 of us start shooting at me, and well I end up dying.

I either place a floor above someone and quick edit trying to shoot them first and they pull a double barrel and shoot me in my pinky toe for 150. 

&amp;#x200B;

I either try to have a fair fight but the guy seems to have unlimited C4s and pretty much spam them till I die.

&amp;#x200B;

I either die because I keep building my way up trying to heal but this guy keeps grappling up with a 2x barrel and luckily hits a shot on me.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this situations, do I just take the L? I'm a good player and in this situations I look at the best option I could of used but is situations where there is absolutely nothing I can do.

&amp;#x200B;

Or placing 2nd place because I have not materials even after getting over 15 kills, and the last guy seems to never gotten into a fight spamming materials endlessly?

We have 5 weeks of the Fall Skirmish remaining, and then we can only hope there would be more Skirmish type events until we get to the Fortnite World Cup, which may have even more than 2 casters.

Some people I would love to see cast one of the skirmishes are:

**SypherPK:** He does the educational commentaries on his channel, and has tremendous knowledge of the game and does a solid job articulating it. He's also been a competitor in several skirmishes and has been doing scrims fairly regularly, so he knows the competitive side of the game, as well as some of the other players and their drop spots, stories, strengths &amp; weaknesses. While most of the casters have paired with Zeke, it would also be awesome to see Sypher pair up with NickMercs.

**Dakotaz:** Dakotaz doesn't have the competitive knowledge, in that he hasn't competed or done scrims. But he's one of the most soothing voices out of the Fortnite streamers, and has a massive fanbase. He would definitely be able to provide solid analysis and keep things entertaining, without being a hype-up caster. He also may have more knowledge of the EU scene, since he's living in France. The only problem is that he's never been one to use a facecam, but it would be awesome to see him.

**72Hrs:** This one is highly unlikely that we ever see, because Tom should be a lock to compete in every skirmish event. If him or Chap is chosen as one of the captains in the Fall Skirmish, they'll choose the other as their partner. If neither of them are named a captain, you can assume that someone, either a pro or a content creator, will choose one of the highest earning pros as their duo partner. But 72Hrs would be the ideal caster, as he has advanced knowledge of the game and the competitive scene, but he is also an entertaining personality, constantly cracking jokes and providing excitement.

Some others that I'd love to see but don't think would ever happen are Myth and Ninja. Myth has shown the desire to be a pro player first, despite being one of the most successful streamers. Choosing to take a week off from competing doesn't seem something that is aligned with that drive. He would be more of a last minute replacement type guy, since he lives in LA, if he weren't in the Skirmish, he could be brought in to cast, but unlikely that happens. Ninja would be another one who could do very well as a caster, since he is engaging but can be serious and informative, and has knowledge of the competitive scene, as well as the competitive side of the game. But casting would require him to miss some amount of time from streaming, as well as this means that he wouldn't be able to compete, which being a competitive guy, he wants to do. The only way this may work is that with the Skirmish only being Friday now, there's a chance that he could get in and out without missing more than a day of streaming. He has said that events like that have to have a benefit for him, either in exposure or pay, but Epic could make it happen.

**TL,DR:** **I think Sypher, Dakotaz &amp; 72Hrs would be great casters. Let me know what others you would want to see as casters.**",FortniteCompetitive

They only do a good amount of damage if you land a good shot. That being said, is the current shotgun spread good?

If you didn’t know shotguns have a spread of pellets that they shoot. Each pellet does a certain amount of damage. So the more pellets you land, the more damage dealt. 

Is there a good way to improve this? 

You could let the shotgun spray more pellets and each pellet does less damage. 

You could also let the shotgun spray less pellets and each pellet does more damage. 

My last idea is you could have shotguns only shoot one bullet for a set 80 body shot and 150 headshot. Personally I don’t think this would work for all shotguns, but maybe a new shot gun in particular.

There has been alot of dicussion about how KB&amp;M players compare to controller players and i've seen that many people have no idea what their talking about, probably because they've played only on one platform. 

Ghost Aydan, KamoLRF and obiviusly NickMercs performing well in Summer Skrimishes has really started alot of dicussion.

***I'm going to list the differences and how big they are between thise two platforms***

1. __Building__ 

Building is very important aspect of Fortnite and you need to be good at it in order to succeed in both competitive play and even in public matches. People usually tend to think that building speed between PC players and console players is big, but it is actually really small. 

On Both KB&amp;M and controller you can use 4 fingers for building (one structure per one finger) wich is why the difference in building speed between top level pc and console is small. The reason why PC players might be a slightly quicker is due to turning bit faster and having higher fps.

2. __Editing__

You may have seen those Youtube video titles from console players like: *I edit like a pc player*. Those are misleading. The difference in editing between controller users and KB&amp;M users used to be HUGE, but Epic made editing delay on console smaller in last patch. The editing delay for controller users is 0.15 and it's still very noticiable when compared to zero delay when playing on KB&amp;M. 

Controller users will get instant edit in future with custom button binds wich will make controller players able to edit as fast as KB&amp;M players. But for now, KB&amp;M is clearly better when it comes to quick edits.

3.__Aiming__

KB&amp;M is and has always been superior when it comes to aiming. While in this game aiming on KB&amp;M is still superior, the difference between controller is not nearly as big as it is in most games due to bloom. But still the biggest difference between controller and kb&amp;m in this game is aiming, especially tracking with smgs.

There is one expection wich i wanted to mention, Ghost Aydan. While his aim is not on par with best kb&amp;m aimers in Fortnite, he doesn't leave far behind. His shotgun flicks and smg tracking are so insane that it's hard to belive he is using controller. He is gifted for sure.

4.__Positioning__ 

While there is no difference in positioning between kb&amp;m and controller, there is reason why top controller players might have slightly better positioning than top kb&amp;m players.

Good example is NickMercs, he is not as cabable of fast editing and building as top PC players so he need to focus on getting advantage by positioning himself well. In Summer Skirmish he got 8 kills in a match due to his good positioning.

5.__Hardware__ ^Fps, ^shadows ^etc

This is where PC players have advantage over Console players. PC players can adjust ingame settings how they want, example turn motion blur and shadows off for better visibility when console players are stuck with certain settings.

Top PC players are playing on 144/240fps while console players are stuck with 60fps wich makes basically everything from building to aiming harder.

*There it is, this came out longer than i tought*

Server issues aside I know I didnt play perfect and I am sure there is a shit ton of work I need to make on my game however we cannot ignore the fact that there is a serious need to provide a kill incentive in game that is actually worth going for...  

And I am not talking about tournament points for kills I mean that this is actually a gameplay problem where if you get to spend 15 minutes afk farming and not interacting you are probably going to have a way better shot over someone who gets zone boned all game and had no chance to take a fight that gains mats and gear. This was the problem late game. 60 to 70 people in a tiny space who really had no reason to do anything else.  

We need real benefits from taking a fight. Ideas like: being awarded mats, control over peoples traps and buildings, health regen temporarily, discounted material costs, temporary gas invulnerability,  dog tags over dead bodies the killer can pick up for benefits, temporary move speed boost (adrenaline).  Or any ideas you guys can come up with.  

Now I know what are you are thinking, ""NEACE, IDIOT, NOOB, MORON. Fake ass pro player these gameplay changes would make no sense! STUPID ASS!!"". Yeah but we literally can all build an 10 story tower on like 6 seconds so wtf does making sense have to do with anything at this point. Thankfully Fortnite is one goofy ass game and we should be trying any and everything to fix this issue. Imo this is a gameplay issue. Yes the servers blow sometimes, yes there is a value of being a smart player but goodness we need gameplay shifts for more exciting matches and opportunities for more skill expression when faced versus other studs. In my mind when I go into match I think to myself if I am build battling a pro in a pro game, by default I am automatically going to lose the game now either during or right after the fight. Like its all luck if I get anywhere after that point because I am going to use all resources because well.. they are good to. Lol.

This is a serious issue that we cannot ignore. Players hate the late game slot machine but I mean Ill take the gamble every night of AFK and hope the zone loves me if it gives me a shot at cash. I am a terrible lategame player but I am sure eventually it goes my way plus its the only thing that makes sense at the moment.   

Id love to hear your thoughts guys. Maybe a couple Fall Skirmish competitors can tell me that I am stupid and its completely fine but I am not sure I am that far off base here. I think there are changes that could shake up gameplay that could really make these matches awesome. I got some other ideas for the future broadcasts that I would want to share but my wife going to kill me because all I do is think about Fortnite. Anyways you guys would love to hear feedback.

TL:DR I asked what he thought about tactical suicide to deny points, and he responded saying ""its just part of the game"".

And while i disagree, and dont want it to be true, i certainly understand where Kentih was coming from here. 

This was brought up regarding another similar situation, this time [regarding CoL Hogman and Faze Tennpo](https://clips.twitch.tv/DependableInterestingCucumberOhMyDog), in the first game of (iirc?) week 6 of Summer Skirmish. They did not log out quite as blatantly as Kenith - but Hogman did choose to suicide to the environment - running into storm on 2 hp -  to deny his kill going over to any other player instead of playing out his life as best he could.

I brought this up because it seemed to me at the time as if this was a huge, abusable problem in the way Fortnite as a game and kill-based formats in particular are set up. There are many situations in this game where it is not worth playing your life, if it is far more likely that you will die and give a point to someone you are competing against. The fact that there is NO penalty for dying to environment, but there is in effect one for dying to a player (as you never know if the person who is shooting at you needs one more kill to leapfrog you in the standings) - and this is a crucial and exploitable flaw in the system.

If this isnt addressed, in my opinion its not out of the realms of possibility that we'll see pros use logout macros - in a similar way to how hardcore ARPG players use them to avoid their character dying to a monster in game and them losing all their progress and points. 

 While Kentih did choose a somewhat questionable way to highlight this mechanic, it does raise a very important issue with the game as a whole, one that i feel should not be swept under the rug by opinions of the person highlighting it. ",FortniteCompetitive

Yes, this weeks skirmish had A LOT of problems and there have already been several threads detailing that and I don’t wish to repeat the points of other users.

But still, my question still stands: how can a game that is so incredibly popular attract so little viewers?

Are Epic failing to market it?

The main Fortnite stream was not showing video cam footage of the playing they were showing, this caused the viewers to feel really disconnected from the gameplay.
2. The Fortnite stream was not delayed, and the streamers who were broadcasting from their point of view had a two minute delay. This made it impossible to watch the main stream and a players perspective, because they were two minutes behind.
3. The real gameplay and action is not being shown. Instead, we are viewing players who are camping in one by one’s or players farming mats, while I can see in the kill feed people getting killed. Why are they not spectating the fights?
4. The casters have no clue what they are doing. Zeke, who has been the made caster (other than the last week of summer skirmish) for the past 8 weeks (or so) still does not know how to commentate professionally. I do not want to hear cringe jokes about players, while they are fighting. I want to here in depth commentary about the fights. The other commentator also had no clue what he was talking about. He just said what was going on, and did not give in depth analysis.
5. Make. Eliminations. Matter. This is the reason the game was lagging. You Need four eliminations to get a point. Why would you fight someone, lose all your mats, ammo, and health, to not receive any points. That is why there was fifty people left in the fifth circle.
6. Lag. I saw multiple players lagging and complaint about lag throughout the entirety of a match, including the very beginning. How does this happen? Epic is using a private server, and yet they still can not get rid of lag; at least at the beginning.
7. Teams. Why are the players split into five teams. Nobody cares what team players are on, and they will not gravitate towards a team, because if they follow a specific org, that org is split up between the five teams, and therefore you can not root for that org, because they are not on one team. This makes teams useless, and drains the fun out of the skirmish, especially with the casters mentioning the teams every five minutes.

When you have 100 people with 50 teams and let's say the skilllevel of every player is equal. Every team has a chance of 2% winning the game in the beginning. Of course there are factors with certain variety but compared to other esports where you have only 2 teams so both teams have a chance of 50% to win. 

Huge difference isn't it?

Yes, realistically the math isn't correct but I just wanted to make a point. It's a game of chance which you can increase by playing smart, but not really a lot since of high RNG, like loot,bloom, storm and even more.

This is a the first Fall skirmish, so there is definitely time for Epic to improve. So what was wrong with today's skirmish?

1. Casters suck. Why is Zeke still casting? I think most fans watching any competitive gaming event want to hear enthusiastic and serious commentary along with intellectual and excited analysis. Not a bunch of off-topic discussions, bad jokes, and circle jerking between the casters and players. Omg I really can't stand to hear Zeke's cringy fake laughing for another week.
2. Viewing experience is terrible. While the addition of spectator mode is a plus there is still much need for improvement on their spectating system in terms of performance (choppiness/lag). Gameplay seems much more boring than previous skirmishes. You can't see the damage done and it is very difficult to keep track of where and how much health a player's teammate was. So much action being missed and poor replay clipping added to the poor viewing experience. Finally, they have not improved at all in terms of keeping track of standings. Viewers need to be able to see and follow which players are in competitive positions and how many eliminations players have. We need a live leaderboard system to supplement the gameplay, even if it's not added to the livestream.
3. This format is not good. Eliminations are still not valued highly or consistently enough. It makes for boring gameplay, campiness, and RNG late game circles with healoffs. Eliminations need to be valued more fairly to take away some of the RNG elements of the game (obviously not all RNG can be removed from Fortnite). In my opinion, all eliminations should be reward 0.5 points, points for placement 1-5 should remain the same.
4. Who thought the 5 assigned clubs format would be a good idea? Nobody cares about these random clubs; are we just suppose to suddenly become fanboys are a random club? The clubs are so large and the nature of random assignment makes it seems like the players are competing for nothing.
5. Goes with the previous point, but FORTNITE NEEDS A COMPETITVE MODE. At the moment, there is no objective system for valuing players and deciding who deserves to compete in these competitive events. Organizations scouting have no good way to find new good players except for following pro scrims/PL discord, watching streams, and word of mouth. PL discord is a good system in theory, but as we have seen, it is not objective in deciding who gets into pro league since it is run by players themselves. We really need a competitive game mode to foster the competitive scene in Fortnite.",FortniteCompetitive

tl;dr The average player that you're going to run into in the morning is worse than the average player you're going to run into late at night. Also, the average player you're going to run into in 50v50 is significantly worse than the average player you're going to run into in duos or squads.

I won't go into all of the technical details, but I built an application which records every match I play, the names of every player in my match (even if they have streamer mode enabled), and each player's stats.

I wanted to answer a few questions that I've always wondered about, namely:
1. Does the playlist I'm in impact the average KDR and win rate of players in my game?
2. Does the time of day impact the average KDR and win rate of players in my game?

Before I start throwing data at you, here's a couple of things worth calling out.
* All of these matches are from the current season
* KDR and win rate in this post are the seasonal values and not all time aggregates
* Players with fewer than 100 matches on a season are not included in these numbers
* My stats and the stats of my mates are not included in these results. At the very least, I'm present in every one of these games and this would just skew the data. After all, I'm interested in the players I'm being matched against, and not my own stats or those of my party members
* All of these matches are from US East servers
* ""hour_of_day"" is the hour of day in the US Eastern timezone (since that's where the servers are located)
* I'm playing on PC which means that all of the stats from solo matches are from PC players. Other playlists are cross-platform.

Observations:
* Duos and squads seem to have the highest average player KDR and win rate. However, part of this is likely the result of the time of day that I'm playing these game modes. Also, it's worth pointing out that the average squad player win rate is going to be higher than the average solo player win rate. Squads and solos have the same number of players, but with squads, you can have as many as four players coming away with a win. To control for some of this, I created the final two tables which showcase average player KDR by playlist AND time of day.
* The average player in a match in the morning has a lower KDR and season win rate than the average player in a match late at night. There's a decent amount of variance for matches in the middle of the day and some of this is likely due to the fact that I'm usually only playing ""middle of the day"" matches on weekends as is true for many other players.

Further research:
* Do these observations change if we just look at a player's solo stats? This would allow us to control for players who just get carried all of the time, and also adjust stats by platform since solo matches are never cross-platform.
* Will these observations change for next season?

Overall there’s too many luck factors for this to even become an “eSport” . This makes a good entertainment event but it’s nowhere near close to competitive.

If you do not know how to play with the members of your squad, you will not play well with your squad. Most of the time bad chemistry comes from thinking you are the best player and therefore you must look like the best player at the end of the game (usually meaning getting the most kills).

My evidence?

It's anecdotal, but I have a lot of experience with it.

One of my buddies who I play with is an amazing solo player. 15% win rate, 3-4KD, multiple 20 bombs. He can beat just about any player in a fight. Yet when I play in a squad with him, we do not perform like we have that type of player in our squad. Why? Because he plays the fortnite equivalent of ""hero ball"" (for those of you who don't know, hero ball is a basketball term, meaning that one player is trying to win the entire game by scoring every point and making every stop on defense. Usually it results in a lot of turnovers and bad shots.). When we land Tilted, he consistently pushes 1v4 fights on low health, ignores requests to help teammates who are pinned down, instead continuing to loot/do whatever he wants. Out in the open he insists on pushing everything he sees, often leading to our team getting stomped by players on high ground or better weapons.


Now compare this to another one of my buddies. He is a 1.5 kd player with a 3% win rate in solos, yet when I play squads with him we win out tilted more consistently, win more consistently, and get more kills. Why? Because he plays with the team, knows when to push, and listens to call outs.


tl;dr Don't be a dipshit when playing squads, you will win more often if you think of yourself as the worst player in the squad and listen to what your teammates say rather than feel the need to prove how good you are.

An optimal loadout for me right now is heavy shotgun/famas/hunting rifle/shockwave grenades/shields. I like using the famas as a swap weapon for both heavy shotgun and hunting rifle, I basically never have it out to use first so my bread and butter is bursting with a hunting rifle or heavy shotgun depending on range, quick swapping to burst, build rinse and repeat. If you cycle heavy famas 1 burst after the other your left with like a .5 second delay on the circle swapping back to heavy and can’t shoot right away which is why I like to build or just go for a 2nd famas burst of the situation doesn’t require building. If you swap without hesitation against a good player I find myself getting off a full hunting rifle shot/burst before they build to defend it(hunting rifle being a projectile means your first famas shot is hitting at the same time at not even too distant ranges as the hunting rifle shot). The grappler is more fun than shockwave grenades, but realistically since you can’t swap to a weapon very quickly against a good opponent it leaves me feeling vulnerable. Played a game recently where I grappled to high ground against the last opponent planning to use double barrel but they already had their double barrel out, since they got the first shot on me the 2nd shot won them the game leaving me only time for 1 double barrel shot by the time grapplers let me swap. I feel the grappler being strong is a bit overrated, just opinion. With shockwaves I box myself up against an enemy but instead of weaving in popping a mini during the enemy reload I’ll take that second to shockwave myself out of the 1 by 1 as far as I can. Build between us when I land just in case and use the 2nd grenade to completely disengage heal loot etc. I’ve also found a new love for the grenade launcher ever since I’ve treated it as a “1 fight win”. It felt ineffective to use a slot before because I’d take it at any point in the game and use ammo sparingly. If you pick it up with the intention of winning 1fight by blowing all your ammo, you normally do win that fight and can replace the GL with something your target was carrying after instead of half-assing 1 shot at a time and playing it at a slower pace. How do you guys use the new items, do y’all have any combos that you don’t see many people using working well and which load outs perform best for you in solos?",FortniteCompetitive

The more build around you that you control the better your position.  It also helps with heal offs letting a more aggressive player with many kills edit through layers of build that normally wouldn't belong to them (or anyone) to more effectively interrupt healers.

Some people have brought up traps and it's fine just let the traps remain hostile even if the wall it's stuck to is technically owned by you.


I really don't see the downside.

If the video isn't JUST the clip, please rename the file like ""AR laser 2 guys at 2m30s to 2m45s"" so I know what kind of play to look for and roughly the timestamp. Renaming the file makes it way easier for me when working with multiple files at once.  Preference for high quality files.  Not really sure if, for instance, twitch clips, are good enough that when edited/compressed again it'd be worth watching.

I’m trying to overall improve in everything in terms of building, IQ and winning.

[Stats](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Osukis)

My stats are not as good as I wanted them to be this season, I am struggling with finishing off games, i start getting worried when their are 10 people left and the game and kinda play scared.


I usually drop at the building beside junk junction then take the rifts either to the circle or cut through pleasant park to Titled. When it’s the final 10 I play on the edge on the circle usually third partying then engaging who ever is near.


Overall I’m just looking for more players to grind with and links to better my skills as a console player, I want to progress onto scrims but I don’t believe that I’m ready

Thanks! ",FortniteCompetitive

I don't think this will come back anytime soon, so I made a [FBR Time Played Calculator](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oMguEVfirGlbMC5iwzNZfymInIPF0T4D/view?usp=sharing). (Be prepared to be depressed)

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially, enter your stats for solos, duos, and squads, then select during which Storm Shrink or Safe Zone period you typically place  respectively using the drop-down. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shrink: Storm is actively shrinking

Safe Zone: Storm is not actively shrinking

&amp;#x200B;

The calculator then takes the average time to that safe zone or storm shrink zone and calculates the time played. ( I use [https://fortnitetracker.com/](https://fortnitetracker.com/) for stat tracking.)

&amp;#x200B;

So for example, for Solos I typically Win during Storm Shrink 7, Place Top 10 during Safe Zone 6, Place Top 25 in Safe Zone 4, and Place in Top 50 or worse in the first Storm Shrink. Over the 1799 solos matches I have played, this amounts to 385hrs or 16 days of play.  

&amp;#x200B;

For those who may ask, I do not include wins in top 10, Top 10 in Top 25, etc. Additionally, feel free to change the average times if you want to be more specific. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, this does not include LTMs or Playground sessions as this is not tracked on the websites.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy!

Some specific things I'd like feedback on:

* My movement. Often times I'd run into things or fall off builds or harry potter myself, and it makes my gameplay feel a bit clumsy and uncoordinated. Any tips?
* Crosshair placement. Coming from playing CSGO casually for a couple years, I know that crosshair placement is important, but I'm not sure of the best way to go about it. Often times, I feel blind because my crosshair placement isn't in the right spot or I'm looking at the ground.
* General tips on feeling nervous ig. When I got to mid/late game, I definitely felt a bit nervous (you can tell by the horrible chokes I had lol). It's a problem I've had in other games when playing solo, and I feel like it's really putting a damper on my gameplay. I've played 886 solo matches total, 639 of which are from this season, and I feel like it hasn't gotten much better. Not sure what to do about it.
* Game sense. I've always had horrible game sense, and if you could point out certain situations I could've played better with some reasoning, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
* Any other feedback is gladly appreciated.

I changed my mind.,"[https://streamable.com/8go11](https://streamable.com/8go11) See an example. Btw I know I could've avoided dying to fall damges here but that's not the point, the point is several times I just get the high-ground denied again just because the 2nd guy has an RPG. 1st it's incredibly quick at destroying stuff, and second this RPG guy could very well have litterally 30 minutes of play time and still be able to do this. And that's not just this that made me change my mind, it's just when you think about it overall.  
Seriously I think the idea of ANY explosive destroying several layers of structures shouldn't ever exist in this game.  
RPG was already very strong when it didn't for the simple fact that when at close range of just from above, it gave little time to react for the opponent and the radius was huge. AND it was really safe. And really easy to use, and also many people didn't know how to react to it.  


But it was dangerous only in the right conditions and it could be neutralized by building. Now, it can't because it just shreds building. It's one of those ""I lost high-ground so instead of trying to retake it I'll just instantly make the opponent lose it again with no difficulty whatsoever"" like C4. NOT like the bouncers and grapplin who can be countered AND actually needs the user to know what they're doing. And NOT like just shooting at structures because that takes a lot more time and bullets to actually destroy all of the foundations, and leave the shooter vulnerable.  


There's pretty much nothing you can do to stop an opponent shooting at your structure to prevent the shot from destroying your foundations and making you fall. AND it's incredibly easy.  


Honestly I don't understand why they stick with these OP explosives so damn much. Ever since they introduced this stupid idea of explosives blowing up everything in its radius everyone who knew about game balance would tell that was the worst idea ever and yes they finally decided to take it back but only partially. Like ""Allright, we'll accept to nerf it just a little bit since you guys insist so much, geez"" like they absolutely want to stick with this idea of explosives being this strong and cheap...",FortniteCompetitive

Of course, it will differ depending on playstyle but I think that's a positive as the discussion will generate loadouts for different playstyles that others that see this thread could try out. 

Please post your loadout and why you think that is the best for your playstyle and reply to people to challenge them on their decision. My playstyle is very well-rounded as I like being very strong at both close and long range which is why you see me take sniper over DB + grappler. This is my loadout:

1. Supressed SCAR - Prefer the better accuracy over the regular scar as i hit more shots which I think actually increase my DPS even though the SCAR outputs more damage. Prefer over burst since I have an extra spray weapon as I don't run explosive items but snipers instead. Bonus points for being suppressed.
2. 2. Double Barrel - Strongest close quarters weapon in the game, guaranteed kill at barrel-stuffing range unless the other guy also has a double barrel.
3. 3. P90 - Close-medium range finisher if I am out of range for my double barrel or miss my shots, also breaking walls obviously. I've seen many people hear say that they prefer the suppressed SMG due to extra accuracy. I don't think that it makes up for the loss of DPS at close range and I'm not really hitting that many more shots with a supressed SMG and the suppression doesn't matter that much at the ranges I use it anyway. I agree, the supressed SMG is a bit better than the P90 at medium range but the P90 is more noticeably better at close range so the P90 edges out.
4. 4. Heavy Sniper - There is simply no better weapon at long range. As I said, my playstyle is being well rounded so the grappler had to be left out along with explosive items. I pick those up if I don't find any sniper/hunting rifle though.
5. 5. Minis - If you don't run at least one slot for healing items, you're a psycho lol. I'm not a perfect player and will get hit. I prefer minis for consistency - they're very common and you can carry a lot of them so I'm almost always have at least 50 shield. Plus you drink one in 2 seconds so I can maintain that 50 shield in the middle of a fight!

Nothing compares to the feeling of winning your team the game whether it be scoring a TD or clutching a 1v4 to win the game whilst your 3 mates are barely daring to breathe in the discord, the feeling when victory royale flashes across the screen and everybody erupts.

Epic has essentially taken away the ability to clutch in the current meta. Pulling off a 1v4 is 10x more diffucult than it was in previous seasons. In past seasons, most players with skill could consistently solo vs squad. Now, any team with a slight bit of co-ordination, and very little skill, can easily take out a PRO PLAYER simply by holding left click. This is in no way a healthy state for the game. In this meta Quantity &gt; Quality, and whoever has the most splodes/smgs wins. Its time Epic fixed this and made it possible to be able to consistetly solo vs squad again, and take us back to the days where the better player won the fight 95% of the time.

This is the most pathetic argument on this sub but here goes..

* Firstly Console = Xbox AND Playstation. The playerbase on this game consists mostly of Console players than it does of PC Players. Idk the exact % but this not for debate.. this is a fact. 
* Console has Aim assist which automatically gives a noob a higher chance to get a kill / hits on you than if you came against a PC noob.
* The skill ceiling on PC is WAY higher than it is for a console player, a top tier console player will be no match for a top tier PC player.
* Watching a few games on a certain platform doesn't provide enough data to make claims such as ""Console players have the most bots!"" I also see a lot of people throwing %'s around as if they have access to the data to know that 50% of players on console are bots who can't build a wall.
* Solo showdown gave people the chance to enter summer skirmish which has $500k on the line. How do we know that some PC players didn't get a keyboard and mouse with the XIM adapter and played their matches on a console so they have an advantage? This seems very likely actually especially with the XIM adapter going out of stock days after EPIC said they allow KBM on console. 
* Who gives a shit which platform has the better average player? Seriously guys.. read over your comments and see how pathetic it sounds from a third party perspective. Just play the game and stop fueling pointless arguments because without the data, you are all just speaking from your PERSONAL experience. There is no study done on this nor any data to back anything you guys are saying apart from the fact that a top tier PC player will demolish a top tier Console player and that's based on the fact that theres no cap on FPS and you can set keybinds.",FortniteCompetitive

Double pump was only strong because every encounter was super close because of building. Turtling in pro game will always be a problem because of building except if taken extreme measures to stop it. If you raise material gain you get problems. Fights can take forever when both players have 2k mats for example. If you lower material gain you get problems. People can't defend themselves making you an extremly easy target since mobility is limited and time to kill is very low. Initial positioning is more important so you have to rely more on RNG. They never would have made smgs or explosives that strong  if building wasn't such a huge problemchild.

-Those who die and click restart
-Those who die and analyze what they did wrong
-Those who succeed and think about what they could've done better. 

You see streamers like tfue talk about it all the time.  ""I can't believe I let that guy hit me"".  Once you incorporate this mentality, the wins will just start pouring in.  

Now about aim assist on console.  It's basically auto-aim, use it!

Crosshair placement is more than 50% of aiming.  In Counter strike, everyone moves while keeping crosshair at enemy head level, so they have to make micro adjustments to get headshots. The same principle applies in fortnite. It's all about the travel distance, it's the difference between trading shots with your enemy or shooting them and dropping a wall before they even have a chance to react.  I play on PS4, and luckily we have aim assist.  Most people don't utilize it the way, nickmercs for example, does.  Watch his gameplay and you will see the way he strafes.  He does not use the right stick to aim whilst in the air, he times his shots. He waits until his crosshair is aligned with his enemy and then lets it rip!  However, while this is good practice, you want to avoid getting caught in these 50/50 shotgun scenarios.  Shoot and build, its as simple as that.  To truly maximize your chances of winning, you need to hold yourself to a higher standard.  

I encourage you to go into playground with a buddy and place your crosshair to the side of his body.  Click L2/LT to ADS and BAM! Your crosshair will lock on to your enemy similar to GTA5, but not to that extreme.  You can literally walk in circles around and enemy while spamming L2/LT and it while do the tracking for you.

Now what happens if we keep focus on keeping our crosshairs at head-level and click L2/LT while in the general area of the enemy head? Headshots baby.  There is a significant distance between aiming console and PC.  Not only the input devices, but the actual methods/tactics. You will see dozens of streamers just flick and shoot.  This is very possible on console, you just have to flick, tap L2/LT and then shoot.  Let aim assist do the work for you. I see this many times, people ADS and then pan to the left or to right with no control while trying to track an enemy.  Instead, move your crosshair near your enemy and then click L2/LT.  Even if you are already aiming down your sights, let go of L2/LT and click it again to reset your position.  

Now go make us proud! 

I hope this helped someone, I was writing to a friend and started rambling, so I figured I'd just post it on reddit because it might help someone! Haha ",FortniteCompetitive

Also, considering that in this current meta SMGs are so dominant and they deplete mats so quickly, I think that this change is more necessary than ever.

Having more than 150 health isn't super common (in my opinion) in solos and I feel like players should have a chance when trapped in a build fight. The average player should have a chance to react to getting boxed in. I feel a little different about this in squads because I like being able to box a player, trap him, and move on to the rest of the squad.

My suggestion for a change could be to lower the damage back to 125, or increase the deploy time by half a second. When trapping a player we definitely deserve to get a hit, but we should be required to take a second step when getting the elimination.

And drum guns didn’t exist.

But what if Epic implemented a nerf to where players  can’t turbo build on the same piece over and over agaiin. Meaning when someone is spamming AR shots (and now drum guns) you can’t just hold left click and wait for them to reload/get bored/disengage momentarily. I just played a game where I had 3  people shooting ARs and one Drum gun against some Omega  that was just jumping around in a corner of a building in tilted holding left click and survived much longer than he should have. He didn’t fire a single shot at us, and with the phasing fix, you can’t hold forward while shooting and enter their build and then kill them that way.

I do think all the smg buffs are to prevent situations like this clearly skillful Omega  found himself in. But we wouldn’t need the smg buffs if turbo building wasn’t so prevalent. The build could turn red if you try turbo building on a spot you just built on to make it less obnoxious.",FortniteCompetitive

You can edit out on top, or wait for them to reload and spam back, or wait til they break your wall and shoot them in the face, which only works with a tac and heavy.

Is there anything I’m missing?

I believe there is an unfair bias in the sub because most of us have been playing the game for a long time. I know I have mastered some difficult building techniques only to have them become irrelevant because of the nerfs.  I think a lot of us have superiority complexes about complex builds being the highest skill part of this game. Frankly, the build battle meta was stale, and, ultimately, it didn’t actually take that much skill once you learned the builds.

I don’t agree with the sentiment that it is easier to die to noobs.  If you play patiently, noobs are still noobs, and it is incredibly easy to out maneuver them.

I know that tunnel building still exists in the tournament scene, but I think these newer updates are actually bringing the game in the RIGHT direction for entertaining high level play. We just need a few more tweaks and maybe a new bouncepad-like item.

Performance issues and bugs will not be addressed. That being said, here is an ideal update based on the Numerous posts in reddit as well as Streamers suggestions.

***SHOTGUNS***

 **Pump shotgun**
   - Base damage increased from 80-85 (green-blue rarities) to 86-91
   - Headshot Multiplier changed from 2 to 2.35
   - Damage fall off slightly increased
Pump shotgun headshots at PB range should be able to 1 shot anybody. The Max headshot damage for the green pump with this formula equals 202.1. This rewards skilled players who are able to close the distance between opponents and be able to land every pellet on the opponents head. With spread being the way it is, it is impossible to land a 200+ hit from any farther than point blank.

 **Heavy Shotgun**
   - Base damage increased from 74-77 (epic-legendary rarities) to 77-81)
*Overall, the Heavy shotgun sits in a pretty nice place, but with a change to the pump in discussion, many people worry about the pump over taking the Heavy. This helps mitigate that effect. The epic Heavy can not 1 tap, but the Legendary can. The heavy has a faster fire rate, accuracy, magazine capacity, and slightly less fall off damage than the pump, making it, in general, more viable than a pump.

 **Tactical Shotgun**
   - Base damage increased from 67-70-74 (common-uncommon-rare rarities) to 71-75-80
*The Tac shotguns also sits in a pretty nice spot, but dealing so little damage can be horribly detrimental to it's viability, especially in this ideal update where shotguns get buffed.

-Double pump remains disabled
-Pull out delay disabled for all shotguns when editing

***Pistols***
   - Accuracy increased by 15% (universal)
   - Spread reduced from .25 to .2 (universal)

 **Suppressed Pistol**
   - Damage increased from 26-28 (epic-legendary) to 28-30

 **Pistol**
   - Headshot multiplier increased from 2 to 2.5

 **Hand Cannon**
   - Fall off damage heavily decreased

 **Revolver**
   - Fall off damage heavily decreased

***Building***
 **Wood**
   - wall starting health increased from 80 to 90
   - ramp/ roof/ floor starting health increased from 75 to 80

**Brick**
   - wall starting health increased from 80 to 85
   - ramp/ roof/ floor starting health increased from 75 to 80
 
 **Turbo building**
   - Turbo building delayed to .3 seconds after first building placement
   - Building structures can be manually placed in after a .25 second cooldown

***Assault Rifles***

 **AR's**
   - Automatic Assault Rifles (M4 and Scar) Accuracy increased 10%

  **Burst AR's**
   - Burst Assault Rifles (Burst and Famas) Accuracy increased 30%

 **LMG**
   - damage to structures decreased by 10%

***SMG's***
   - All SMG's damage to structures decreased by 20%
   - All SMG's Accuracy decreased by 10%
   - All SMG's Fall off damage increased slightly

As mentioned in the title, this is a collective list of changes based on the generous commenters of Reddit and Twitch streamers summed into a single ideal update. I personally think that, should this update be made reality, that the game would be far more balanced, incentivizing more aggressive and fun play. Let me know what you guys think, as I'd genuinely like to see open discussion on this, preferably civil.

TL;DR: Shotguns get damage buff, AR's get accuracy buff, SMG's get nerfed almost all around except for damage, Turbo building nerf, and newly built structures buff.",FortniteCompetitive

Last night's squad scrims is the first time I've seen them all in a squad group together which seems kinda crazy.

On top of that since they're streaming scrims the various chats go crazy whenever two teammates have a disagreement (which is totally natural). The thing is I don't watch a ton of other Fortnite teams but is this a regular thing? Maybe I'm overthinking it but in the Overwatch League everything is behind closed doors. Scrims at least.

(Personal note) I dont have anywhere near enough money to get another computer this year, as I just got a new mac book (which Fortnite is optimized terribly on). Yet, as someone trying to improve my stats/game, Im being killed on controller by both an unbalanced/imperfect layout that EPIC has yet to fix and by people using M+KB. 

I think Im going to make the jump and get a M+KB to start using on console. As of right now, there are too many other people doing the same and I need to improve before I get tired of being run over. 

Personally, I believe M+KB players should be on PC servers and wouldn’t mind if EPIC made this change or just outright banned M+KB on console, but in the meantime, I dont want to be outplayed by people who have a higher ceiling of potential than I do. So I think its time that I bite the bullet and join the dark side. I kind of feel a bit scummy making a decision like this but if you can’t beat em, join em.

I know this is a strong topic in both the console and competitive communities and I’d love to hear your thoughts and feelings on the whole thing.

So what changed? I don't know about you guys but I've noticed only two big changes:

1. I'm doing a whole lot more shooting at walls than I used to. Meta right now seems to be simply preventing other people from re-positioning by shooting at their walls and ramps rather than re-positioning yourself. 

2. I'm killing a lot of really good players, and dying to a lot of really bad players. This is obviously not always the case, but it is definitely a lot easier for a ""worse"" player to kill a ""better"" player simply by sneaking up on them and being in a better position to start the fight.

Imo it just not good for any sort of competitive play, everyone should either be playing against the same opponents or be put on separate leaderboards.

It was also by far the most exciting and interesting format we've seen in Fortnite so far - at least since Friday Fortnite. They finally gave the community what they wanted in providing incentive to kill other teams - while also striking a decent balance in rewarding playing towards the objective.

However in rewarding kills like this there is always one major concern - the quality of players you came across. Just like in regular pub matches: sometimes everyone you face is a bot, sometimes the three best people in the server all drop in the same place. However unlike pub matches, Epic has direct control over the quality of player they invite to the tournament. So, if we are rewarding kills over a period of multiple games, it just makes tactical sense to find the weakest players in the lobby and target them. Especially when the weakest players in the lobby are nowhere near the average skill level. When the kill target is so low, finding these sorts of players turns what is normally a fairly difficult task, into a much more manageable one. All you need to do is get one victory in a legitimate 2v2, and then sneak a kill on a straggler, third party, or gang up on a solo.

The duo of Pokimane and Kitty Plays are by no means new players. Both are competent, far better than the average player, and this post is not intending to shit on them. However i dont think anybody will take it as an insult to suggest that neither of them are remotely on the same level as most of the lobby was on Friday.

I have chosen to focus on them because they finished dead last of all the teams, with two elims between them in eight games. I think its fair to say neither of them found the experience enjoyable, and you could tell that Kitty especially became incredibly frustrated towards the end. They did not end up finishing the tournament, and its probably just as well given the statistics im about to go into, and just how much they affected the standings. Kitty it seems did not leave enough time and had to leave for a prior engagement, but was also very tilted by the end. Poki while less visibly irritated, seemed to be much happier going back into her usual stream after Kitty left, and did not bother keeping up with the rest of the tournament once she left.

I went back through both their streams to watch their deaths, who's points they influenced, how their materials and gear helped the players who killed them, and just to what extent this impacted the tournament. *I will summarize this below, if you want to read my full notes - including increasingly salty quotes from Poki and Kitty - [i have pasted them here for the sake of brevity in this post.](https://pastebin.com/PBHbh9d2)*

* **Over the course of eight games, six times the duo who killed Kitty and Poki went on to get five kills in that game.** In the majority of cases these kills gave the duo much needed materials and loot, and in some cases let them push for kills they would not have been able to otherwise.

* The only cases this did not happen were in games 4 and 5 - only as results of third parties interrupting the cleanup. In game 4 we saw HD's perspective on stream, he early third parties the engagement between Tempo Payne/Vapejesus, otherwise this would have been easy two kills for the Tempo boys. Hilariously, Kitty mis-clicking her rifle while attempting to hide baits HD into focusing on her, and not the low HP and turtling Payne - who then gets the drop on HD with a good boogie bomb. Game 5 Poki gets confused about player locations (a common theme from the VODs) and falls easily to OneshotGurl... Nick Eh 30 meanwhile massively over-builds allowing Kitty to escape in the confusion. 

* In three cases these kills were the difference between 4 and 6 points overall, arguably representing a $4k + difference in prize money. 

* The reward was often more than just elims. In game 2 Kitty handed over over 1000 combined mats and a jump pad that was essential in securing the 5th kill on a low hp Hamlinz. The next game she and Poki give PainfulPvP and Yoyokeepitup a Golden P90 she forgot she had, 2 big pots, a rocket launcher, mats and c4. Killing this duo in mid-late game was often the most lucrative play you could make.

* By the end of the tournament duos were excited to find out it was them they were facing, and showed little respect in their play as a result recognising just how free the kills were, some going as far as celebrating and laughing at their good fortune. 

* One of the lucky duos was **eventual winners, NRG Zayt and SKT Saf.** It was the first game, so its a stretch to suggest that this significantly affected who won - however it very easily could have had any title contending team had better luck and stumbled upon them.

* Yoyokeepitup and PainfulPvp especially owe the duo a big thanks, as out of the three 5+ kill games they managed to score, arguably two of them were thanks to feeding from this duo. Its also possible that the L-dancing from Yoyo was the straw that broke Kitty's proverbial camel's back. 

* They even handed C9 Blind and ItsDiggyTV - afaik the only console player in the tournament - the only points they would receive from the tournament.

* And lastly, a moment of silence for Dr Lupo and EU Dimes who were the only casualties of the meme duo. Lupo especially gets extremely unlucky - managing to land a direct rocket on both of them at once while they third partied his fight.

TL:DR:

**It massively cheapens the tournament and format as a whole, when certain duos represented in the tournament are viewed as ""free kills"" to the top tier pros competing.** In almost every game not only did Poki and Kitty die easily, handing over not insignificant loot, but directly contributed to the killer's score increasing unfairly as a result. It turns an otherwise exiting format into ""who can stream-snipe the meme duo first?"". In addition it simply is not enjoyable for them either, and neither is it fun to watch for their viewership. Both Poki and Kitty's streams essentially became Fortnite main channel re-hosts, with added salt. Its one thing for a duo to under-perform, its quite another to have duos who never stood a chance in hell competing. I hope Epic will learn from this, and avoid inviting these sorts of duos in the future - or at the very least partner them up with someone competent enough to have a decent go at carrying. There's lots of pros not invited who im sure would have loved the opportunity, and it would have been better for the tournament overall.

Its good to work towards being average both in your stats, but more importantly in how you play.

I suggest a good standard for average be set around a 3 kd and 10% win rate give or a take (a little)

The player who has a 30% win rate over 100 games is much more impressive than someone with 60% over 10 games because the 30% player has shown they can consistently perform well at a larger sample size.

Everyone has bad games. Sometimes internet cuts out, sometimes cats jump on keyboards, etc.. It's not fair for that player who landed and something like this happened in their first 25 games - that's one game completely lost, however if we were allowed a larger sample size, little deviations like this would matter less and the better players would be on the top of the leaderboard. Changing it to best of x number of games rather than first whatever number of games eliminates some of the variability and luck involved.

I think a much better format for these would be best 15 of 40 games. If you win 15 games in a row with 20 kills each, you probably don't have to do 40 games, but the guy whose internet went out because their dog chewed a wire might be able to redeem himself and prove himself to be a better player if he had the chance at more games/a larger sample size.

TLDR; I think the Solo Showdown system needs to be changed to best of ""X"" games; such as best 15 of 40 games to reduce variability/eliminate some of the luck involved/give better representation of skill over a bigger sample size, rather than reward those who might've won 8 games in a row in Solo Showdown, when their overall win% normally is 4% (I've seen players like this on the leaderboards).",FortniteCompetitive

“We are working on changes to matchmaking that are aimed at creating matches with a more balanced distribution of skill.” 

This sentence right here, found in State of Development v4 sent the fortnite community into an uproar. People read this and said “NOOO EPIC DONT IMPLEMENT SBMM.” And then epic was like “okay we hear you loud and clear”

However what most people failed to realize the wording of the heading and that sentence in the state of development indicate that it has already been implemented in some way. *MORE* balanced. Matchmaking *IMPROVEMENTS*. If they were planning on implementing it it would have just said: “we plan on creating matches with balanced distribution of skill”

Their original plan was to have SBMM matched players more prevalent and more narrow in skill gap assuredly, howver after the backlash I’m sure they kept it as is or barely changed it. Something like 25-50% of the lobby is matched according to skill but the rest are completely random. I’m sure based on the wording of the original post, they wanted a majority of the players matched based on skill but the uproar caused them to change their mind.


Tl;dr: SBMM is definitely implemented in some regard based of the wording of the original post by epic talking about it and based off of several pieces of anecdotal evidence from players all over the fortnite community.

I’m an avid fortnite player who’s been playing since season one. I used to play it casually till very recently where I have now took it upon myself to become the best player I can be. I wouldn’t consider myself to be great or bad at the game, just good to average if I can even say that. I have over 195 wins, 79 of those being in solos and 85 in duos. I wouldn’t consider myself a slayer nor a camper, but mix of both where I like to choose my battles carefully and pretty much carry on myself on momentum if I go on a killing spree. I can build pretty well and I rarely lost a build fight. Even got a few pyramid trap kills. The new LTM provided me with a chance to really test myself and set a baseline how I will do in future showdowns. I took it upon myself to play Solo Showdown with the goal to at least reach 2000 points and thankfully I did. I  got exactly 2188 points with an average of 87 points per game. I landed mostly where the viking mountain is to side of it where you will find a small grotto full of items and 3 chests. It’s honestly my sleeper spot and I always come out with 1k+ mats. There’s even a rift for bad circles. I sometimes landed at motel too to less success. All in all, I am somewhat satisfied with my results and honestly could have done MUCH better.

These are my placement points

1.) 142 (1st - 7 kills) (this is the format in which I will list my stats)
2.) 115 (3-4)
3.) 46 (31-1)
4.) 94 (4-1)
5.) 103 (3-2)
6.) 112 (2-3)
7.) 106 (4-3)
8.) 61 (11-1)
9.) 124 (2-5)
10.)136 (1-6)
11.) 55 (11th place)
12.) 72 (10-2)
13.) 87 (7-2)
14.) 45 (22nd place
15.) 103 (5-3)
16.) 109 (3-3)
17.) 118 (2-4)
18.) 93 (7-3)
19.)106 (2-2)
20.) 45 (22nd place)
21.) 40
22.) 130 (4-7)
23.) 40 (36th Place)
24.) 45 (23rd Place)
25.) 61 (14-1)

I have a lot of room for improvement and I checked out my replays after every single win or loss to see what I did wrong and what I could have done better and this what I came up with:

1.) *Bad Landings*: Really one of the worst culprits for deaths for any player. Where I landed can either be feast or famine. Most of time it had stuff for me to last me the whole game, but sometimes I’d leave with very little and didn’t leave much room for error. I alleviated this by also rotating to the houses behind the mountain and next to snobby where I’d pick up items and move on. While this sleeper spot didn’t really get me killed too much, it did sometimes put in bad spots in terms of itemization. Where I did die the most was when I landed at motel which has become somewhat of a more popular spot over the seasons and I’d have to contest items and sometimes I’d lose out. It can be a weird fighting spot as it has a lot of rooms and angles to die from.

2.) *Bad Positioning*: A lot of the times I’d position myself at a disadvantage where I’d really be on the lowground on a lot places where the enemy could have natural highground. It didn’t even need to be a giant mountain but a small hill where I should have been but now the enemy would have a head start in the build fight and build over me. In the later circles I would also have the tendency to hide a little and find a shot to kill a pair of enemies fighting. Often what would happen would be me is that I’d get caught by the circle while having to build cover b/c the enemy would be shooting at me. Even if I made it near the enemy, I’d still be below them and retaking high ground this meta is next to impossible with the spam. I feel like I should be more aggressive in these fights and start to third party more rather than waiting for a weakened enemy that has enough time to recover in their towers. While I didn’t die to this, I’d get cocky and give up high ground while chasing a wounded enemy in a build battle where they could easily regain it to only recover and kill me. It’s surprisingly easy to be slippery in structures. 

3.) *Not Finishing Fights in Time*: Sometimes I would take way too long in a fight that it either resulted in a third party coming in to kill me or that while I’m recovering, the whole map has been alerted of our presence that someone finally came to finish me off. The zone would also be on it’s way and I’d have to hurry in a rush and this was very harmful when it came to late game as the circle would tick for too much and the enemy would be pressuring me while running to zone. While not exactly related to this sub point, maintaining high ground after fights to scout my area would have been a lifesaver as I could have seen threats before they even came and be more prepared even after a fight. 

4.) *Bad Aim*: This killed me the most times. I need to hit my shots more. So many fights came down to one bullet or one shotgun shot. While I did hit most of my shots, I tend to panic when I’m below 50 health and spray everywhere sometimes. I really need to work on that. And of course, sometimes bloom would fuck me over but what can ya do. Also I need to be picking up the silenced SMG less often, the nerf hit it hard and it really isn’t worth shooting even in the close range at all. ARs have more purpose now.

5.) *Panic Building*: Sometimes I’d get surprised and build pretty badly. Sometimes I would carelessly harry potter myself in where the enemy would get the upper hand and kill me. Sometimes I’d panic if I got overbuilt and would box myself in while making a plan to calm myself down. Sometimes the enemy would pressure me too much and I’d die in there. Boxing yourself in is basically suicide now this meta with the p90 and drum gun. I need to think more quickly and on the move more often. 

6.) *Bad Attitude*: Never play when your tilted, one of the reasons I did so bad is that I had to slog out my last few matches and it showed. I normally play 2-3 matches before taking a small break but I couldn’t this time. Being tilted made me make horrible decisions and resulted in my deaths so many times. It would exacerbate  all the reasons I mentioned before. It was just bad. Sometimes you just need a break. 

7.) *Miscellaneous* : These are some smaller reasons on to which I died or did poorly. 

-Enemy is simply better than me and read every move
-Enemy would get very lucky with zone 
-SPAM and more SPAM
-RPG and Explosives spam
-Sticking my head out for too long
-Inconsistent Shotgun Damage
-Pinching
-Being *too* cocky
-Not paying attention to my health
-Not paying attention to the game in general. Burnout

*Final Thoughts*: This is a very long post and I honestly congratulate you for making it this far. I am really happy with how I did in build fights, I really did feel challenged and when I got the high ground and killed someone, it felt earned. I’m just glad I could stand up with my peers. It was a good start to surely would be a lot more to come. Fortnite is game that really is a gem and there really isn’t any other game like it. While I don’t agree with every decision EPIC has made, I feel that the game at its core is still the same and that the best players win out. Of course there’s always luck in the process, but with the this format of showdown, it really showed us how consistency is key to being the best.

If you have fellow sweats that will 1v1 you in playground to help speed up the learning process,I recommend doing so.

■Go to accessibility in ps4 settings go to custom assignments and change X to R3 and O to L3.

■Turn on the new sprint by default toggle in fortnite settings 

And voila you NO LONGER NEED O which means you can finally play without taking your thumbs off the analog (with the exception of changing traps and mats / picking up items/opening doors). 

Hopefully in the future they could make O or L3 the dedicated edit since sprint by default finally frees up a button so console could be that much closer to pc-like gameplay.

Crouching with X does take awhile to get used to as does pressing R3 without tossing your reticle wide which shouldn't be much of a problem as long as you play around 8/8 or below sens (I play on 9/9 and this took way too long until I dialed down and worked my way back up I would suggest doing the same if you struggle maintaining your aim)

As much as I'd like to buy a scuf and have my down dpad, square, circle and x mapped on the back this is the closest optimization I can think of for us standard controller players.

ALSO for those of you that are ok with making your controller a little ugly and not using reverse on the ATKs you can YouTube diy triggerstops which is basically screws in the back of the R2 and L2, the activation for R2 and L2 is so low on DS4s (For fortnite) that you can basically turboboost your rapid fire on pistols(useless) and the like.

I hope this proves useful for any players that like adapting and optimizing their gameplay via new muscle memory :)",FortniteCompetitive

206,Forceablebean6,1532924463,930zwg,34,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/930zwg/ranked_fortnite/,46,Ranked Fortnite,"What are your thoughts on having a separate mode for ranked Fortnite each season? 

I think it would have many benefits but some possible downsides. 

One benefit is that it could be a better alternative to solo showdowns in terms of getting players for tournaments because of a much larger sample size.  It makes it harder to cheat by getting players to be free kills as being a free kill would negatively affect your rank, and therefore I think the pro scene would benefit. Another benefit is helping out newcomers to the game by reducing the amount of top tier players sweating it out in pub lobbies, perhaps increasing the amount of new players that remain with the game. To incentivize experienced players to actually play ranked, there could be vbucks rewards for reaching certain tiers.

However, there could be downsides in splitting the player base. I think that Fortnite is too big right now to feel this, but later as people leave the game this could be felt more. Additionally, as with all ranked games there will be people reverse boosting and trying to clap newer players, but I think a counter to this is tracking ranked stats separately from normal stats and having them reset each season.

I think adding ranked could benefit Fortnjte’s eSports scene by creating a larger pool of players to choose from, help new players gain a better foothold in the game by easing the difficulty of pub lobbies, but it could also bring some issues with it.

At this moment, the [""unique""subreddit style](https://i.imgur.com/BgoFHWl.png) has purple titles. As many of you know, a default color for a link (i.e title, in our case) is blue, which turns purple after having been clicked.

In this subreddit, having chosen purple as the default ""new,"" unclicked link color, the color never changes after you've clicked a thread, making it harder to browse through the subreddit and differentiate newer threads from the others (i.g, those you've already clicked on).

Example:

1: A ""new"" thread, using the subreddit's style:  
https://i.imgur.com/xrQmw1i.png  
2: A thread that has been visited (clicked on), using the subreddit's style:  
https://i.imgur.com/zuwwZMg.png  
3: A ""new"" thread using reddit's default style:  
https://i.imgur.com/yj2AEvk.png  
4: A thread that has been visited (clicked on), using reddit's default style:  
https://i.imgur.com/GE967Rv.png  

Notice how #2, #3 &amp; #4 are literally the same color.

In the meanwhile I feel like I'm forced to use reddit's default style over the subreddit's style (not that it's so much different, but still). So tl;dr: mods, please either change the ""new"" color or the ""used"" color (because atm, they're both purple).

\-Would you say it's worth learning to snipe ? I can use deagle well (somehow) but never pickup scoped weapons because I can't do shit with any of them. 

\-Is wrist pivoting bad in your opinion ? I've noticed there are some patterns to tracking with the AR where I'm forced to move my wrist off it's pivot to hit my shots. Do I need to learn to pickup and swipe my mouse to play a shooter on pc or can I just wrist pivot only with high enough sensitivity ?

226,bconnorwhite,1532899762,92y7ou,156,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/92y7ou/perfecting_the_meta/,232,Perfecting the Meta,"With the latest SMG nerf and the last Summer Skirmish I think we’re starting to get closer to a more balanced meta. Still there are a few minor tweaks I’ve seen streamers/YouTubers/and posters on Reddit asking for so I’ve compiled them together and given my thoughts:


————

PISTOLS

——

Revolvers/Handcannons are another group of weapons I almost never see players use. They have a place - a midrange, high risk high reward weapon, but they just aren’t accurate enough/high enough damage at range to be worth using over an AR.


Solutions:

* Remove revolver/handcannon bloom - [make it a projectile](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90i8wq/remove_bloom_and_make_the_bullets_projectile_for/)

* Decrease damage fall off so it still has high damage at medium range

——

Dual Pistols are cool and all, but just as with crossbows and smoke bombs I can’t see where these fit or why we need them.


Solution:

* Vault the Dual Pistols


————

AR + BURST AR + SMG + DRUM GUN

——

Accuracy:

With the SMG buffs and the introduction of the Drum Gun ARs are much less valuable than they used to be. The Drum Gun especially begins to creep up into AR mid range territory. The Burst is even less useful due to lack of first shot accuracy for the second and third bullets.


Solutions:

* Slightly decrease AR bloom. This will allow ARs to shine a little better at mid range over SMGs/Drum Guns.

* Decrease Burst AR bloom even further to compensate for lack of first shot accuracy for second and third shots.

——

Structure Damage:

A big use for these guns is knocking down opponents’ structures. However, SMG/Drum Guns do far more DPS to structures:


Blue Drum Gun DPS to structures: 207

Blue SMG DPS to structures: 228

Blue AR DPS to structures: 181.5

Blue Burst DPS to structures: 157.5


This makes the ARs less viable, while the high structure damage from SMG/Drum Guns moves things a little too far towards “Just spam SMG, Lol” instead of “Just build, Lol”


Solutions:

* Decrease SMG/Drum Gun damage to structures

* Increase AR damage to structures

* Really increase Burst damage to structures. [Burst is just not worth picking up otherwise.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/922it7/burst_assault_rifles_need_to_be_buffed/)


————

EDITING

——

One directional fully transparent editing was probably unfair, but now its actually harder to see while editing than while not editing. This means its both risky to edit down through your build to find a player you have high ground over, and risky to try to retake high ground. This results in less interesting build fights - players rely more on SMG spam/explosives, or turtling in a box at the bottom of a build.


Solutions:

* Make edits 50% opaque instead of fully opaque

* Allow both players to see through structures being edited


————

PUMP

——

Now that we have shotgun switching delays, the pump pull out delay to combat double pumping is not necessary and makes pumps less valuable than they probably should be.


Solution:

* Decrease pump pullout time. This combined with bidirectional transparent editing and decrease to SMG structure damage mentioned above will bring back quick interesting shotgun plays in build fights rather than SMG spam always being the best choice.

* *Maybe* increase damage so that headshots are 200 with blue pumps and heavy shotguns


————

EXPLOSIVES

——

Right now one explosion can take out an entire 1x1. Explosions should take out more than one wall, but probably not four walls and a ramp.


Solution:

* Slightly decrease blast radius so at least one wall is still standing after an explosion to a tower’s base, or limit to piercing two layers (i.e. first wall and ramp but not wall behind ramp).


————

STINK BOMBS

——

Stink Bombs are one of the best additions to the game to stop players from camping/turtling because they do damage through walls. However, it also has to be worth it to give up a slot to carry these.


Solutions:

* Increase stack size to 6. Since these spawn in 3s, having to drop the 6th is always sad :(

* Increase DPS slightly


————

STORM

——

Having the circle move into the storm for the final circles is probably a good mechanic, but it probably moves a little bit too fast. I keep getting wins where the last player dies to the storm or panics and falls to their death (we also saw this a lot in Week 2 of Summer Skirmish), which just isn’t an exciting way for the game to end.


Solution:

* For circles 7,8,9 move wait time back to 45s/30s/30s and increase shrink time instead.


————

HEAVY SNIPER

——

In matches where players don’t panic, most games still end with 3 players in 1x1s crouch peaking, and then the player closest to the circle wins.


Solution:

* Add that wall-piercing sniper that has rumored to be coming to the game which will make it riskier to just sit in your 1x1 and crouch peak, forcing more interesting finishes (should not be able to one shot though if the bullet has already broken through a wall).


————

GUIDED MISSILE

——

Going back to the problem of 1x1s, the guided missile adds another threat from above, and provides another way for players to attack from the low ground. However, after the upcoming readdition and nerf I think it will end up like the bush - only used by noobs and for memes. Its just too risky to use since it gives away your position and makes you unable to move.

Solution:

* Allow switching back and forth between missile view and player view. I want to fire a out a window, switch back and edit that window/build cover/protect myself/look for enemies, then switch back to controlling the missile, etc.


————

GAME MODES

——

A lot of people have assumed Epic has made some of these changes (SMG/explosive buffs, building/editing nerfs) for a reason - to decrease the skill gap so the game is more fun for new players. If this is the case I think this is a vailid concern, but I don’t think a lower skill gap is the right answer.


Solutions:

* Permanent Playground and 50v50 will help with this somewhat

* We probably need a permanent ranked solo mode accessible to players with X number of wins, with a ranking system that will actually attract the most competitive players to compete in, giving newer and intermediate players a little more space to improve.

Trying to be as neutral as possible, the only realistic reason I can come up with is that Epic doesn’t want to discourage players from playing that may not be capable of buying a PC. For accessibility reasons, I get why they’ve made the decision of allowing KBM in public lobbies on console. Maybe we should consider putting KBM users in PC lobbies. I can already hear the amount of complaints we would hear from that. Why though? Don’t like level playing fields?

Moving forward, there is no realistic reason you should allow KBM players to play in a competitive format on console. In order for a game to be competitive, you need to attempt to create an equal playing field for everyone. Say two of the best console players are facing off, (one using KBM, one controller) can we actually say the KBM player is the better console player if he bests the controller player?

An equivalent scenario would be allowing a pitcher in the MLB to use a metal bat because a wood bat is too heavy for him.

What about receivers using Stickum in the NFL because gloves limit your dexterity in your hands?

A lot of pros are discouraged from speaking out against Epic right now because they historically haven’t gotten invites if they’re highly critical of Epic. Epic is charged with balancing around a casual audience, while trying to appeal to a competitive one as well. When we look at an organization such as MLG or UMG (not talking about FF), they don’t select players for their tournaments based on clout, or how vocal they are. These players are selected based off of performance. This is how we get he highly competitive scenes where we see the best face off continuously. Additionally, these orgs can ban specific items that the community agree is/are too strong. Epic realistically can’t ban items without being hypocritical of their product. 

With Epic running these tournaments, we are seeing a blend of political correctness, amateurism, and a dose of empathy. We often feel like these tournaments leave us lacking something. That feeling we get stems from missing out on seeing all the competitors actually be pros, the consistently changing format and lack of appropriate balance, the awful spectator system, and amateur production. Personally, I believe Epic is testing these Summer Skirmishes to figure out the best format for the upcoming Worlds Tournaments. It’s a smart move, but there are very obvious changes that should have been done prior to running these tournaments. I’m specifically referencing the unstable custom lobbies (fixed), spectator mode, balances, etc.

A fix for most of the issues we see here? Outsourcing your tournaments to proven professionals. It takes time off Epic so that they can develop where they’re lacking and commit resources to the appropriate places, while it also offers the best possible production quality the industry can offer.



Note to Epic: I get that the casuals make your game, and I get that’s where the money comes from. I’m not knocking you for making money, you do you boo boo. Over the past few weeks you’ve improved vastly with your tournaments, so take that W as well. But you’re getting to a point where you’re stuck. 

You’re stuck between casual and competitive. You can’t ban items (would be hypocritical, right?) You cant balance a competitive mode differently than the casual experience because the viewing experience would be lost on casuals, it would be too different. You can’t say “no” to KBM on console because it would look indecent from a PC standpoint. 

Let a third party run these for you, they can determine the appropriate balance by banning specific items. Let them have ultimate customization of custom lobbies, I promise they will figure out the most competitive format with competitive players helping. It’s a win/win for you. If they ban items, XIM, etc then they take the flak. Not you.

Granted it looks fast and twitchy, similiar to how Jaomock builds and some others build....I don't know that it's actually much faster than how we see most good pros do 1 by 1s (if you were to actually time it). And these guys frequently trap themselves (or dont build a wall or floor in an area) because they dont seem able to track or keep in-sync with the rapid movement.

In which case Ive seen them die because of trapping themselves under a ramp. Dare I say that their building style is good eye-candy for a moment, but a tad inefficient in high pressure combat. 

Would it be beneficial to slow it down just a tad? Also, isn't there a limit to how fast anyone can build due to the vertical movement in-game characters are capable of?

273,xDonny,1532827046,92r5yf,110,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/92r5yf/summer_skirmish_faze/,139,Summer Skirmish - FaZe,"Let me start of by saying I have a lot of respect for both Tfue and cLoak, I think they are one of the best players fortnite has to offer at the moment.

However, I do have some notes I took from their recent performance in the Summer Skirmish.

Here are some clips I will be referencing in my post:

* 1 https://clips.twitch.tv/PowerfulSleepyTurnipItsBoshyTime

* 2 https://clips.twitch.tv/FurryAgitatedOrcaDxAbomb

* 3 https://clips.twitch.tv/InexpensiveLuckyGrasshopperPupper

* 4 https://clips.twitch.tv/NurturingInspiringPigBrainSlug

* 5 https://clips.twitch.tv/GrotesqueElatedMouseOneHand

I feel like the Tfue and cLoak, as good as they are, completely underestimated the non-pub tournament. They pretty much started the tournament with what seemed like a ""we are the best""-mindset and it backfired quite heavily.

In clip 1 you see them lose a fight to two people who invested resources in getting two kills. Tfue wasn't impressed; ""They lose the game 1000% after that, they just cost themselves the whole game""

These players did actually end up winning the round. 

Shortly after cLoak is heard saying ""Actually, we are better than everyone in here"" as you can hear in clip 2. I'm not sure if Tfue felt the same way about that statement, maybe he did, but it shows quite the arrogance. Especially in a tournament in which they achieved close to nothing compared to what was perhaps expected of them.



Sadly, Tfue and cLoak, two of arguably the best pubstompers this game has to offer, chose to play it safe until the lategame hoping to pick up 5 kills and the win at the end of the round.

This led to them constantly avoiding any people or fights, but also left them with very little loot outside of their initial scavenging after the drop. Although most player are relatively low on ammo in the endgame in this tournament I feel like Tfue and cLoak were underlooted almost every single time they made it into the endgame.

Naturally, the people that actually racked up a couple kills (Something they constantly talked about doing but never actually did) actually had solid gear to work with in the endgame.



If felt like Tfue and cLoak weren't on the same page for most of the tournament, several times you'd hear them contemplating where to go without any solid planning.

They were also too split apart during several fights like in clip 3. 

Tfue is seen going for the mini's inside the gasstation, however there is an enemy on screen 4 seconds into the clip when Tfue and cLoak are still next to eachother.

Tfue calls them out and throws sticky bombs in their direction after which he makes a move for the mini's.

As he does that, cLoak moves up the mountain and seemingly loses vision, can't cover Tfue anymore and Tfue goes down shortly after.

For a team that played so careful up until that moment, this move was incredibly reckless and was incredibly unecessary.



Clip 4 is where we see a flaw in decision making by Tfue, instead of just dropping down he places down a bouncer, hits a wall and is launched into the storm which at this point in the game was ticking for 10hp/s.

To add insult to injury, LiquidChap threw a perfect sticky bomb that ended right next to Tfue for the kill, leaving cLoak alone with little health and soon with no health at all.



If you check out clip 5 slowly, you'll see that when cLoak notices the enemy will have a pump before them, both Tfue and cLoak still have some air to work with.

They could've made the decision to fly to the nearest rifts close to the south but made the decision to land anyway. This decision was sadly very short lived as both were eliminated without even picking up ammo, let alone a gun.



TLDR; I feel like Tfue and cLoak could've performed a lot better if they had clear decision making, a better gameplan, more scrim practice, and perhaps a little less arrogance.",FortniteCompetitive

However, I would argue that it could workout, giving poker as an example. In poker, there's a great amount of luck involved, but we consistently see the same players winning tournaments. That is because, desptie the bad beats, skill matters more in the end, similar to the BR format. 

I think that players are rushing too fast to conclusions because we have never seen this type of game in a competitive format before. When there's some luck involved, games become more thrilling which brings more people in to watch, just like poker, while remaining viable for tourmanets as long as a good ratio between skill and luck is maintained (70% skill and 30% luck).",FortniteCompetitive

Even though Fortnite doesn't always award you for good aim, those FSA shots need to hit. So to practice your aim, you could do it on another game, cause Fortnite doesn't give us a good option to do so.

This can help too with your muscle memory if you play more than one shooter game.

Mesure the distance which your mouse needs to go through for you to do a 360º or if your sens is really low, a 180º. Go into any game that you can practice your aim and adjust your sens in there with the mesures you took.

Me for example: I used to play Rainbow Six, and I got so used to my sens, so comfortable that I wanted to have it in every game.
My hipfire sens is 32,5cm to do a 360º and I had my ads sens to be the half of the hipfire, so 32,5cm to do a 180º. 
But CS:GO is better for aim practicing since you have some workshop gamemodes to do so. So I mesured my sens and got it perfectly matched in it. And then, on all games I may play.

My friends say I have a problem and that I'm nuts, but the consistency you can get by doing this is awesome.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm not currently content with the path Epic has taken in terms of balancing the game and also guided missiles coming back ! Are they really listening? 

I play on console btw (ps4). Here my stats if you care to look. https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Phornado

I started season 1 and enjoyed the game a lot. Season 2 I played my heart out basically and I loved working on getting better first when combat pro came out and then when builder pro came out. Learning new building techniques and editing as well was so much fun.

Undoubtedly though right now it feels there isn't much to work on in terms of getting better, the meta is basic and is more reliant on bloom with smg and ARs. Shotguns are basically garbage. I never liked having to take rockets or GLS but now I have to. Building feels so nerfed and the problems with builder pro on console haven't been fixed yet.

Some of them are :

▪Changing traps when pressing the place trap button twice. (Really annoying)
▪Looking down and placing a flat platform above you.
▪Not being able to edit unless you have the same blueprint of the piece you want to edit. (If I have a stair blueprint out it won't let me edit a floor)
▪Holding to edit instead of a tap among other problems.

As a competitive player I strive to get better but with out a mnkb or a scuff it seems you're limited and it shouldn't really be that way. It seems Epic has forgotten about console improvements and now their #1 priority is trying to get the newer player base to stay by lowering the skill gap. Now it's all spray and pray and bloom rng that taking someone down no matter how good the player may be takes forever if they have shield. 

So many negative changes in terms of keeping older players interested has caused me to not feel excited about playing like before. Does anyone share that sentiment ? Solos feel like a drag and duos and squads are fun for a bit. Not many high kill games lately and I usually play agro but everyone is dying so fast. I feel like I'm farming all the time and there is almost no variety in the weapon load outs. I want fortnite to succeed as it has been my main source of entertainment for a year but I'm finding it hard to enjoy as of late.

What motivates you to keep playing this game ?

Or if Al Michaels and Cris Colinsworth didn't know the score when Tom Brady was on the 2 yard line? Because that's what Courage and his partner keep having to do in this Summer Skirmish tournament. 

Every tournament and event I have watched this year, whether it was the ProAM, Friday Fortnite, or Summer Skirmish, has people constantly asking ""What's the score?! What's the score!?"" The tournament appears to have just been one on the FINAL kill of the entire tournament. And the announcers were questioning and making sure.

At first I had a lot of categories but after a while I noticed my deaths could really be classified into just a couple of important categories. At first HEADLESS CHICKEN was in the lead, i.e. running into fights with no mats and not knowing where your opponent is while simultaneously making a ton of noise. 

But as soon as I noticed THAT was happening a lot, for some strange reason it started happening less and less. I guess I'd become more aware and took conscious steps to correct? Then came the days of POSITIONING, i.e. not putting yourself in a favorable position (left-hand peak, highground, wherever) before engaging. 

And guess what started to happen? Yep.

I am by no means a pub stomper, but I hold my own. I started in late season 2. I have about 175 wins now, spread semi-evenly between all the game modes. (Plus another 50 on the Switch)
I am honestly seriously having trouble with this current meta. I think confidence is such a huge part of this game. When I am feeling it, I can really just move and play naturally and do well. When I get stomped, the confidence waiver and I second guess all of my moves.

Every season my stats rise a bit. I am at around 12% win rate this season and 2.4 KD. However, this week has been brutal. I feel my game slipping away and it's obnoxious and frustrating.
Here is my question:
How are you guys doing? Are you winning less? Have you adjusted yet to the current SMG and weak builds meta and still kicking butt? Have you walked away from the game for a bit due to the frustration and waiting for the next set of updates?
I know many of you are legit amazing at this game so I come to you genuinely interested in your answers and looking for advice during the current state of the game.

For UK gamblers, SkyBet has odds for the duos playing in tonight's Summer Skirmish.
Since it is very new it seems like a good way to earn a bit of money as the traders don't really seem to be offering the odds based on any kind of knowledge.

For instance, Hamz and Myth are at 7/1 while Liquid72hrs and LiquidChap are 34/1.

Liquid are my tip. Liquid finished 3rd in week 1, the only duo Summer Skirmish so far, with the 1st and 2nd place teams not even competing today. 

In week 2, Chap came in 7th place, with only 2 people performing today that finished higher than him. 

34/1 seems like a very good deal to me.

Personally I have put £20 on it Liquid taking this one at a return of £680
This week's format to me seems like 13 points gives enough time to remove complete RNG bullshit, with 4 points for a win and 2 points for 5+ eliminations, that's at least 3 games played even if a team wins the first 2 games with 5+ kills. 

Any other teams on this list that seem to have really good odds?

With the scoring being the way it is, 6 points per kill allows those like myself to be able to play like the bloodthirsty animals we are and not feel pressured to ""camp"" or ""hide"" until the final circle. Let's just say you average 7 kills a game, you probably will be at least in the top 10 for placements, netting you at worst 112 points if you place 10th. This means if someone who camped the entire game and gets 1 or 2 kills wins, you will at least tie for points. THATS IS NOT A LOT TO ASK FOR. 7 kills in a competitive format does seem daunting at first but if you are an aggressive player, you will be able to do it.

One month in I started to know the importance of building and I changed my keybinds to something more comfortable but I didnt  care so much about dpi/sens

I mainly play squads/duos because there is always someone who wants to play with me and it's rough to say no so I dont really play much solo.

I know solo is the way to improve so I am starting to play more.

I took a lot advices from this sub like:

\-Changed res to 1440x1080

\-Bougth a new mouse where you can set dpi's (My previous one had one button to change it but you cant really see the number of the current dpi's assigned) Also I changed dpis (1000) and sens (0.10)

My struggle is with build battles:

\-When I place a ramp above me and not under me and consecuentially I loose highground I start to panick and I drop down to the bottom

\-When I have the highground and I cant see my opponent I also start to panick and I drop down too much ending in  getting killed

\-I feel like I know every technique in my mind but I always end up failing while performing it. Its like my fingers are to slow to transform what its in my mind

About switching weapons: I tried to unbind the mouse wheel but in that time I died to totally bots and I was loosing my mind so I had to revert it back.

What I think I improved since January is: Rotations , Movements , Aim (Close range is meh but long range is good)

I've seen the new Pro Keybinds and I think I migth give it a go

Brief: I played lots of hours since January and I think my level of skill is very bad compared to the majority of the playbase

One of the biggest things that was displayed in the last weeks summer skirmish is how we have 3 separate platforms that competed but they were compared on the same leaderboard. 

In my opinion Epic needs to dedicate their controller competitions to one platform and have all their console competition on there. It makes more sense from a competition aspect. Then we need to have seperate leaderboards for similar layouts to last weeks S.S. 

Another idea I had is instead of making it a complete pubstomp similar rules (prioritizing kills) would be to have a way to make a seperate playlist that is shows your interest to compete and basically says ""EPIC! I would like to play and I'm ready to go!."" Epic can then look at where you placed if you competed in prior Showdown events, your K/D, Wins, etc. 

* Ideally I would like to see the lobby of 80-90 players of different skill levels something divided up like 25-30 that qualified to compete, 30-40 good pubstompers, and fill the rest with slightly above average players. Make the prize pool available to those that competed in games, if someone who didn't qualify to compete gets puts into a game and does well let them fill more games and make the competitive aspect of Fortnite actually display some of the better talent competing against each other. 

For PC for you could even pull some of the top console players as they are at a natural disadvantage.

What do you think? Who do you think was snubbed? Who do you think is overrated/underrated? Is this list accurate at all? Should we do this again in a month?

I think it's pretty clear that this list is dominated by popular streamers, but I think that's to be expected. Obviously we can't all know about the lesser known players that have much less exposure. If we don't know about you, we obviously can't vote for you to be in the top ten. However, among the guys that have gained that exposure, I think this is a pretty good list.

Discuss.

434,Zimzams123,1532640544,926eis,23,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/926eis/neat_tricks_with_preedited_roofs/,184,Neat tricks with pre-edited roofs,"As im sure you are all aware, roofs in Fortnite have always been neglected as the least useful of the four building options. While high level players have found niche uses for them here and there, generally speaking they are nowhere near as relevant to everyday gameplay as  walls, ramps or even floors. The point of this post is not to say any of these techniques are useful or even worth learning, but to simply provide points of experimentation for players better than me to try out themselves.

We are already accustomed to Tfue hiding under them to heal, players placing them on top of floors for extra protection, and pros occasionally using them in buildfights to mess up the opponents building. However afaik they saw little use beyond these scenarios. So i tried experimenting a little in the playground with what can be done through pre-editing roofs to a more useful shape, and what this can allow you to do in common building scenarios.

If you are unsure how to do this: all you need to do is press whatever button your roof is bound to (by default it is f4). Then, before clicking to place one, press your edit button. Edit the roof into your preferred shape, then press the edit button again to confirm. Now whenever you build a roof, it will instead build the edited shape.

So, what can we do with this?

**1. Roofs are ramps!**

Roofs can simply be used to be ramps of a different direction to the ramps you normally place. This lets you accomplish the same result as placing a ramp normally, then using the edit function to rotate it, by simply pressing a single button.

Here's one potential use for this i was able to get down very quickly: the (""Zayt bouncepad""){https://clips.twitch.tv/CuriousGracefulGerbilYee}. As you cna see in the clip, Zayt manages to cleanly edit a normal ramp to face the opposite direction, and place a bouncepad on it, all while running forwards so it didnt mess up his momentum. The sneaky eyed of you will also notice that he placed a floor beneath the ramp, so that he did not have to jump while doing so.

Here's a clip (me doing it with a pre-edited roof instead of on-the-fly fluid editing.){https://plays.tv/s/LpcqRVFGoAUi} I hope you can agree, this seems much easier.

In addition, ramping downwards off high-ground is a common scenario, and i frequently see streamers having to wait and take a second to edit and re-edit ramps to do so. Perhaps having a dedicated button for this scenario is worth it?

**2. Roofs have editing advantages!""**

A few patches ago we got hit with some pretty significant nerfs to the power of editing. This hit the power of 1-by-1 camping hard, and made edit advantage through Walls and Floors much less game-breaking. However, the changes did not hit ramps that hard at all... and the same goes for roofs!

As a matter of fact, roofs carry a small editing advantage even over ramps, which could lead to them being used of even normal ramps in certain situations. Here's a (clip of me showing what i mean.){https://plays.tv/video/5b5a37a1dc60f5af1d/ramps-vs-roofs-editing-advantages}. The big difference, as i hope the clip makes clear, is that there is no mouse movement required to edit away roof - ramps. You can simply cancel the edit by pressing mouse-2, returning the roof -ramp into its normal roof form, allowing for an easy shot, as opposed to having to drag the mouse and edit the ramp into another, viable, ramp formation. 

**3. Wedge Shapes 1-by-1s**

The formation i am calling the wedge can be accomplished by editing a roof, by ""activating"" opposite squares in the edit profile. Which way round you do it doesnt matter whole lot, it will simply change which side of the screen you have to lean your mouse towards. Its a little tricky to place consistently and understand the logic of, but it does have p[potential uses beyond making neat minecraft - style art, and being the annoying ass roof of the custom house outside Wailing Woods.

This shape has the most potential use imo at the top of a 1-by-1. What this does is allow for 180 degree vision, with all the usual perks of a 1-by-1 for the dirty camper within you. Provided of course you are at a diagonal angle to the people you face. It also has the noticeable benefits of having more layers of protection from more angles, and making it easier to shoot players that are beneath you, while also making you less exposed in the process. It is however, much jankier and time-consuming to set up, moderately defeating the purpose of a quick and dirty 1-by. 

Once again, (here is a clip of me demonstrating how it could be build.){https://plays.tv/video/5b5a37b43c081f8b7e/roof-edit-1-by-1} It seems like it would be most relevant in later-game scenarios, where you often have your back to the circle and therefore do not need 360 degree vision. If you get shot at from a side, and have managed to pull off the side-wall edit i show at the end, you have both a wall and an edited roof in between you and bullets - instead of just a wall. This is true for more angles of the 1-by than a normal configuration.

And finally, the one i am most hyped for people trying out:

**4. Quarter Pyramids in ramp rushes**

This one is really weird to describe the shape of. It is accomplished by activating 3 squares and leaving one square blank. Unfortunately, this is the biggest case of direction being a big concern. However some really nice potential:

When ramp rushing - be it single or double, with however many layers you've learnt to build it with - there is always one key flaw with it. You can only face one direction, and its janky as shit to turn. What this shape does is let you do a quarter rotation of your ramp rush fluidly, and keep going! This can also be used as an out to being ramped over, in case you couldnt pull off the examples shown on the front page consistently, with the benefit of being at a 90 degree angle, so not needing to follow it up with a turn build.

(Here's an example.){https://plays.tv/s/LpcwXGLeBypb} I thought i managed to pull it off well enough to show just how fluid you can achieve what would normally be a fairly un-fluid manoeuvre with normal build patters. The big disadvantage is it makes all subsequent building incredibly unstable, relying on that one roof piece for integrity - however it just might be powerful enough to warrant usage anyway. Of all of these patterns this is the most important one i feel, and could really lead to some sick outplays! 



 Let me know what you guys think, feel free to try these out yourselves, and keep experimenting!

a while ago I've participated in ""the usual"" Discord snipes and was annoyed by how it went - So I built something that IMO is the perfect system for snipes. Its been around for a while but I'm just now posting it here.

Key-differences to having a Discord with a snipe bot:

- Automatic game ID detection (No need to type your last 3)
- Automatic duo / squad detection (Players who play together are shown in a grouped manner, obviously useful for squads / duos)
- Synchronized countdown, no matter your latency to my server, the countdown is synced for everyone.
- Clean interface showing all games that resulted from the current round, their players, how many people are still actually alive in that game etc.
- Actually showing players by their IGN. If you play on an alt-account because of stats you are still listed with your main account (And alt)

To clear things up: I am not hosting snipes myself, this is merely a service for hosting them, so if you're a streamer or community owner, this would take the place of a discord snipe bot.

* Q, E, and Mouse 4 for your 3 main building pieces
   * Q and E are usually the 2 best keyboard binds for WASD users due to proximity to strafe keys
   * Q and E and Mouse 4 are all pressed with separate fingers (increases speed and accuracy for combos)
   * Q (ring)            = Floor
   * E (index)          = Ramp
   * MB4 (thumb)  = Wall
   * F (index)          = Pyramid
   * C (index)         = Trap
   * Shift (pinkie)  = Edit - pinkie for shift is better than ring b/c you can’t strafe left easily using ring on shift
   * Mwheel          = Use Key ([https://clips.twitch.tv/DepressedColdKoalaMingLee](https://clips.twitch.tv/DepressedColdKoalaMingLee))

* **Advantages of this set up**:
   * Takes most advantage of MB4 (mouse 4, thumb button towards back) by placing wall on MB4 to always be ready to wall if you get shot at without taking time to move from a strafe key to the wall key.
   * Ramp and Wall combo pressed with separate fingers
   * Floor Ramp combo pressed with separate fingers
   * Ramp Floor Wall combo pressed with separate fingers
   * Pyramid wall combo pressed with separate fingers (pyramid box trap combo)
   * Floor pyramid combo (to stop spam from above) pressed with separate fingers
   * Floor Trap combo pressed with separate fingers
   * Wall Trap combo pressed with separate fingers
   * Can still Ramp + Trap + left click spam with separate fingers while falling to try to avoid fall death with a ramp bounce trap save by using middle finger on E and index on C or index on E and thumb on C (thumb is too sluggish feeling to spam for me).
   * Shift for edit because it doesn’t interfere with movements. No building piece on shift because pressing Q then shift quickly feels awkward, the reverse feels a lot better but still not ideal (preference)
   * No build piece on MB5 so thumb can focus on MB4 (preference)

**If using MB4 does not work for you because it either feels awkward and/or interferes with your aim/mouse grip too much (get a better mouse for you or see below):**

* shift is a possibility now with the always sprint option, but pressing Q then shift quickly is a little awkward feeling, the reverse is not great either but much better. Capslock instead of shift improves the feel of this combo, but capslock competes with shift for attention (you shouldn’t use ring for capslock primarily b/c then you can’t strafe left)
* If you press C or V with your thumb comfortably and feel your thumb has good coordination for build pattern sequences, this could be a good option to keep it on 3 separate fingers
* Or you may have to have 2 of the 3 main ones on the same finger
   * Index finger recommendation, E and as close to E as possible (F or R) (I used Q = Ramp E = Wall F = Floor previously and it was still great, but I wanted to try optimizing further while I was already changing other binds)
   * When 2 out of 3 of the main building pieces are on the index finger, it is better that the 2 are wall and floor because ramp is combod with both of those heavily so it is advantages to have ramp on the separate finger from ramp and wall

I was disheartened by this news, as Friday Fortnite was a consistently well-run competition that generated a high number of viewers. 

I'm not one to bash Epic, or any game developer for that matter (especially one that isn't promoting/establishing Pay-To-Win). However, this seems to be largely Epic's doing with their absurdly low cap on third party tournaments and their lack of communication to UMG/Keemstar about their plans to hold their tournament last Friday as well as inviting every single Friday Fortnite player. As a player base, I feel like we should at least attempt to hold Epic accountable for this. Disregarding the fact that their tournaments up to this point have not been well run, they squashed out a third party tournament that did wonders in promoting the game and bringing its player base enjoyment. 

This was a power move by Epic that only served to benefit themselves, and the extent to which they benefitted is debatable. In fact, I think they only hurt themselves by using this ploy. While we may never see Friday Fortnite again, we should make it known that we won't take this behavior lying down. Epic has done a great job with listening to the player base and making changes accordingly, as well as creating a fantastic game that is constantly engaging. I think with enough outcry from us, we can ensure they don't pull a stunt like this again. 

With that being said, I haven't seen much discussion about the way Epic handled last Friday. I figured this could be a place to discuss what we can do as community to prevent it again or even defend Epic's decision and talk about why you felt how they acted was justified. ",FortniteCompetitive

I hate having to spam click and the fastest, most interesting builds right now require it. I'm talking about bounce pad 1x1, safe 180 turns, 4 layer single ramps, 6 layer double ramps, ramp catching to get to low ground.

Epic can keep these mechanics in the game and nerf turtling if they increase the time to turbo build consequetively in one identical spot. As in if you're turbo building a wall that is getting sprayed down over an over, increase the delay of turbo building by .02s every time the same wall is placed. On your fifth wall, the delay would go from .05s to .15s and people would be able to get shot between wall placement. It could even have a cap at .15s since that's the initial wait time for the initial build.

What do you guys think? Reasonable?",FortniteCompetitive

Stats: https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/tv.Bobakanoosh1

Starting this season I go into most games with a different mindset: winning instead of killing. I won't go for every single fight possible. I'll camp in my 1x1 since I'm on high ground and wait until I have a good opportunity to jump on someone, or I get pushed by zone.

Obviously this isn't the most revolutionary concept, but it's something that brought me from a ~6 KD to a ~9-11KD. There's no point rushing and hoping to get kills if you're just putting yourself in a worse position to die.

The second thing I've done is completely avoid Tilted and other super busy areas. Instead, land somewhere with a rift nearby, loot up, get a good amount of mats, THEN push to those popular areas and clean up. I've found when I go tilted I just get pushed person after person, and hardly have time to heal up or loot. Obviously going to places like this is important for getting better at the game, but if you want to improve your k/d, I wouldn't recommend it.

Hopefully this helps!",FortniteCompetitive

However, what I can’t understand is how a mechanic freely allowed for all players could be considered overpowered. 
The P90 only a few players will find.
A gold RPG only a few players will find.
How can building a mechanic where every player has the ability to perform be over powered.
The simple answer should be that a majority of the player base simply hasn’t practiced it. The response shouldn’t be to nerf it. It should just be a fact of the matter. That to get in build fights you’re going to have to practice.
The nature of any game or sport is that it’s difficult to master. You wouldn’t remove headers from soccer because some players are better at it and can score reliably off of them would you? No you would expect the players to learn how to perform headers.",FortniteCompetitive

This is my current set up with keybinds, I use a Logitech G502 so I got 3 side buttons on my mouse.

Mouse:

- Wall = Mouse 1
- Ramp = Mouse 2 
- Floor = Third mouse button on the side
- Trap = Middle mouse button (testing if I like this currently)

Keyboard:

- Pyramid = Z
- Use = E
- Edit = F
- Harvesting = Q
- Slots are numbers 1-5
- C = Flipping sexy emote to low peak around corners
- CTRL = Crouch

So my question is would it be worth it to remove 2 or maybe even all 3 main builds off my mouse and put them on my keyboard and then seperate those 3 builds over my left thumb, left index and left pinky.

If anybody here made these changes recently, please let me know if it helped you. I’m currently hanging around a 8-9KD and I will make the change if this increases my skill even more in the long run :)",FortniteCompetitive

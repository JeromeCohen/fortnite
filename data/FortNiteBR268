By the time the circle closed in, there were 12 people left.. the FIRST circle that is. The pace of the game is terrible as right now most people drop off at the desert part, lazy links or tilted so I had a thought, why not have an LTM mode or something where it's normal solo's or squads or w.e but instead of 1 bus, have like 4 buses coming from different directions to encourage people to spread out more because if the bus is coming from say Junk junction, chances are i wont go to the desert side as i know others would be down there already and looted up. Thoughts on this?

**Edit - LTM to see how it works and see what the majority think of the idea and if the feedback is great, maybe implement it in the normal modes.**",FortNiteBR

I won't buy any skins or battle passes until they do the right thing and stop suing 14 year old kids. Even really cool ones. If that skin money is going to lawyers to sue kids, i'm out. I don't support this.

Also now one aims for the head at 100m. It’s nearly impossible to hit and a waste of time. Also this should apply to deagles and revolvers. Also if epic wants to change the game this should be step 1 cause right now it’s “get close, build battle and tac headshot and finish off with a smg” which is fun but when you have no resources to build fight this should be seen as a option, to laser someone down/surprise attack Gunplay is important but building is at another level.

*Long Post, be warned.*

I've played this game for quite some time and spent hundreds of hours in improving from all aspects, especially building and decision making. I've seen a lot of tuning changes, balancing, mechanics overhauls and been there for and a part of all the whining that goes on regarding them. However, I've never seen anybody talk about the current state of Turbo Building.

Prior to it's introduction, players built at a relatively slow speed. Even for those who were quite decent, a ramp wall push wasn't a cakewalk and required good mechanical coordination. Turbo building came out and it was a quality of life improvement to those who couldn't click at a rapid pace, but individual clicking was still faster and offered better instant swaps to different building pieces. However, the most recent change to turbo building placed it at 20 clicks per second and it has completely upended the rest of the game by almost completely removing the need to individually click for each building piece and only needing to press different keys instead. The reason why Myth and Jaomock were such amazing players was because they could build at or near a current turbo build pace before it was even introduced. These players would completely outpace their opponents with rapid clicking/building swapping and good decision making which allowed them to get high ground rapidly. It was great to watch players that could break and replace an enemy wall to edit kill them because it was a counter to turtling that didn't involve C4,GL or RPGs and involved a lot of skill instead.

Now that players can build with a computer doing one of the core components of building for them it's no wonder why EPIC has to keep buffing explosives and anti-building measures like SMG/minigun buffs and the durm gun in order to compensate. You think EPIC wants every scrub that can look in a general direction and click left/right mouse button to trump skilled players nonstop? It's because they've gotten on the Turbo Build ride and can't get off for fear of pissing off the players who think they're good because they can spam builds without realizing that the hardest part of the job is actually being done by a computer for them.

Outside of the initial 1-2 minutes of carnage in a game, the other parts of it have significantly slowed down because player engages during mid game will last a lot longer than before due to spam building. Since building is such an effective counter against shooting, even players who lack good aim, decision making and general mechanics can stall a good player for much longer than before because swapping to different keys while holding down the left mouse button is a brainless effort. This is why turtling became such a dominant meta, because it became nearly impossible to contest a wall against someone who'd just hold down left mouse button while pressing down the wall keybind. That's 20 clicks per second. Who aside from CS:GO, LoL and StarCraft pros do you know that can do that?

I get baffled seeing people talk about the explosives buff and the mat nerf without ever addressing the issue of computer assisted spam building. Worse is that they have the gall to call it a lowering of skill when turbo building was the greatest lowering of the skill gap ever introduced in the game and barely anyone bats an eye because it's beneficial and helps them skip one of the more fundamental aspects of PC gaming, which is improving their Clicks Per Second.

I've benefited from Turbo Building a lot myself, so it'd be hypocritical of me to call out others using it without mentioning myself, but I genuinely think it's one of, if not the biggest factor in the lowering of the skillgap to date. It's what allows players with no sense for other parts of the game to force you to waste a significant amount of mats during fights. It's what causes unnecessarily extended encounters because a player can keep spamming builds to try to get your high ground or just turtle there and sit almost completely unscathed (especially if they put a roof piece up as well). It's extra dangerous in solos because the longer time it takes you to try to kill them, the greater chances of a 3rd party player coming in and cashing in on both of you falling to your death from 50 meters, or you being out of resources since you spent it all fighting one guy. It's why EPIC has to introduce disgustingly broken explosives in order to try to counter the insanely spammy nature of turbo building.

**tl;dr** - turbo building is an insane lowering of the skillgap which greatly disadvantages actually skilled players that have a good balance of building, aiming and decision making. The super strong explosives meta exists because each player with 999 wood and 3 keybinds can endlessly spam their builds without requiring any real mental or mechanical prowess to use.",FortNiteBR

Shotgun damage: In my opinion, it's fine. It's called bad aim and if you can't handle that then don't play. Ontop of that if they made every shot consistent on damage then you would be shouting at your screen about how the guy killed you because he got a shot first.



Explosives: Explosives do need a bit of a nerf. Epic knows that, they don't need told for the 779,945th time.

Now I'm not like yelling at him or anything like that but since I'm so competitive (probably too much for my own good), I want to win every game and since he's 4 and always in ""play mode"" it's hard to keep him focused on the task at hand. I love his imagination and his happiness but hes more happy with finding a cool gun but gets upset when he gets knocked or eliminated. I also tend to get a little more frustrated than I should when I'm in a gun fight and I need his help and he's off playing with a stack of pallets or something lol. Playground would be perfect for him but Epic had to take it out for some reason..

So my question is, how can I make this experience better for him and help my sanity out as well? What are some tips to help keep his focus even though he's only 4?

There are 5 different types of explosives. Grenades, Clingers, C4, rockets, and my favorite Grenade Launchers. I'll start with the easiest one.

Grenades- These are the easiest to counter because no one carries them past the first 10 minutes of the game so stay on the battle bus until it forces you off then stay parachuted as long as possible. Once on the ground, farm and don't go anywhere until the 10 minutes are up and you won't incounter anyone with grenafes.

Clingers- ok so this one is tricky because they are sticky. The grenade trick won't work on these because they are useful and people actually carry them. Clingers will do 100dmg to you, so if you have any type of shield you might make it out alive. If you get stuck with 2 just quit and restart, but no one has that good of aim so here is the real trick. Build a wall. Have the clinger hit the wall and run into a rift. If you do t have a rift run because building doesn't work. 

C4- My favorite because it just turns Fortnite into pubg because it removes the whole building aspect from the game. I recommend you shoot non stop to apply pressure. If they are building and applying pressure and using C4 just quit because your dead. 

Rocket Launchers- You used to just be able to build a wall, buy that really doesn't work anymore so I spam build walls, stars, roofs, and floors, because screw it why not I'm already going to die and I don't want them to have my mats. 

Grenade launchers- Here is why they are my favorite. You can spam them like crazy, you won't be allowed to build up if they can use it correctly, and if the first name doesn't destroy it, the other 6 will. Now for the counter... Either pull out your grenade launcher and apply the exact same pressure or quit. There is literally nothing you can do. ",FortNiteBR

I've been playing the game for about two weeks now on the Switch, and at first I was terrible. Fortnite is much different than other traditional type shooting games that I'm more used to. But, the game's a bunch of fun, and I've been working at it. Now I can consistently place top 10 in solos, with about 2-4 kills a game. Seeing as how I play the game [my playstyle], I thought those were decent numbers, but I'll get to that later. 

I didn't realize how much some in the community obsess over kills in this game until I started lurking the community. People who don't get at least 8 kills a game are trash. People what cosmetic items that show their K/D ratio. People want an in game scoreboard to flaunt their kills. The ""right"" way to play seems to mean playing really aggressive, building 300 mat towers for each firefight, and getting as many kills as possible. I don't have a problem with that play style, if that's what you like. I think it's kinda fun to drop at tilted from time to time and just get into chaos, but I don't agree with the push to make the game more kill-centric. The true name of the game is Survival, not Deathmatch. Some people prefer to drop at low traffic places, to pick their battles, to sneak and lurk around when possible, and to fight only when nessesary. I'll gladly take a 2nd place finish with only two kills any day over a 12th place finish with 8 kills. But that seems to make me trash. 

**TL;DR**: I'm a new player that plays conservative, and I don't understand the push to make the game more and more focused on kills.",FortNiteBR

I have been a gamer since Wolfenstein (the original), and seen more innovation to games over time than I can quantify, but the way that Fortnite is constantly changing marks a truly unique moment in gaming history.  I spent the last year bitching about Fortnite microtransaction.  I spent a couple hours trying to learn to build and then complained how building was hard and that this game is for kids.    


I am sorry.  I was bitter because my old hands and old brain took me a little longer to get this game than most.  The hype over the season 4 end and the new season sparked my interest enough to purchase a battle pass and start grinding my way through the tiers.  I spent most of the weekend playing the game, and today while I am at work all I can think about it getting back on.  

Be proud of the community you have here.  Be excited by how active it is and how creative some Fortnite players are.  This game is breaking new ground, and I am happy to be here with you all to see it!

Also them taking away the quantity of mats due to many new players who don’t know how to build. Which makes it unfair to them to die by a better player. Epic knows there day one fans don’t like this but they will continue to do this. They will keep doing this because the Fortnite market relies on the kids.

Okay, so I’ve been playing since September 30th, back when there wasn’t even a season 1 yet. Let’s get one thing straight, being an OG player means nothing. I’ve had people who started in season 3 outplay me in playground mode, and I’ve seen some really bad season 1 players. Just because you found a game before someone else does not make you superior, and does not made your opinion any more valid. 

Personally, I don’t see the fuss about epic bringing back skins *that were never confirmed to be exclusive* 

We have already seen them bring back battle hound after saying “last chance” to get him. Then they brought back red knight, and now Merry Marauder is said to be coming back along with Christmas skins.

Right now, tons of people are being scammed because they want to buy an account with a skull trooper, renegade raider, etc. Epic could solve this problem by bringing back all the skins into the item shop rotation, and not only that, but they would make a TON of money. 

The only skins confirmed to be exclusive were battle pass skins. So skins like Black Knight, Sparkle Specialist, The Reaper, Omega, etc. will never come back. However, no item shop skin has ever been 100% confirmed to be exclusive to a limited time.

Epic is a business at the end of the day, and they will do what is right in order to make the most money without harming the game. 

I believe that anyone who supports the game should have access to all the item shop skins. This would give more value to battle pass items and encourage people to buy the battle pass, since those skins will never come back.

TLDR: Epic would be wise to bring back old skins in order to prevent account scamming and make a ton of money. Doing so would still keep battle pass items rare and encourage more people to invest in the battle pass, yielding even more money for Epic.",FortNiteBR

The building, the RNG loot, the ""last man standing"" scenario... They're all gimmicks. Granted, very well executed and fun gimmicks, but they are not the most essential element.

Why, then, does firing the Assault/Burst Rifle feel so bad? In most shooting games it seems like the AR is the bread-and-butter, everything else is balanced around that weapon type from there.

Yet I constantly find myself opting for SMGs and Machine Guns over ARs. When you've already accepted the fact that your bullets are not going to go where you place your crosshair then you might as well just go for the larger mag size / fire rate to destroy buildings quicker.

What I'm getting at is that for a weapon that is supposedly ""short to mid-range"" the difference in accuracy between the AR and something like a SMG is negligible. The answer isn't to nerf the other weapon types, it's to make firing the AR feel good.

Playing on NA or EU there is a *constant* 15-70% packet loss for many of us. I'd be in gunfights where my bullets would 'connect' but do no damage. I compared my 'live' recording to replay mode of the same game, and the first shots that didn't connect wouldn't even 'shoot' in-game in Replay mode.

This is a **Serious** issue that needs to be addressed, **SO** Many people are having this issue, it's not a problem with our internet, it's a problem on their end. Only happens on NA and EU. Before Season 5, NA and EU were playable 0% packet loss. But now the servers are actually unplayable.

Buy a 2000vbucks skin-Possibly raven,Leviathan or any others that come out and buy battle pass next season

While I understand not everything can take you on a trip to flavor town, there has to be something there then skins that are basically just clones of other skins.

Everything just kind of feels, underwhelming for the colossal map changes and the addition of the ATK. Even The Gems feel weaker to me then Carbide and Omega. Where there was seemingly a conflict going on in universe (even if it was just a movie).

1. Sniper Rifles are effective at a long range

2. Shotguns, SMGs and Pistols are effective at a close range

3. As the eye of the storm shrinks, storm damage increases

4. Players hiding in a building? Knock it down.

5. You can change which slot items your are assigned to in the inventory screen.

6. Use crouch to reduce your profile, or hide behind smaller objects.

If an item has hitscan mechanics that means it's 'projectile' travels in a linear path at infinite speed. This means you *do not* need to account for projectile drop or travel time when firing a hitscan weapon.

Excluding throwable explosives or utility items, here is a list of all non-hitscan-based weapons currently in the game (aka, you must account for projectile drop, if applicable, and projectile travel time):
RPG (no drop) 
Grenade Launcher
Hunting rifle
Semi auto sniper
Bolt action sniper

*ALL OTHER WEAPONS ARE NOT BASED ON HITSCAN MECHANICS!* This means, you literally put your crosshairs on the target and fire no matter how far away the target is from your location. To quote DrLupo, you literally can just:
&gt;click on their heads

Yes, this means the scoped assault rifle and thermal scoped rifle are point and click 'snipers' and should be treated as such! Their actually quite strong when you keep this in mind!",FortNiteBR

In Norse mythology, before Ragnarok happens, snowfalls. This is called fimbulwinter (Great Winter). My guess is that with each coming update more and more snow will fall until the whole map will start snowing, then who knows what could happen. My guess is that this has to do with the ""Road Trip"" skin maybe?

Edit: Also another sign of Ragnarok is the Sun and Moon disappearing, so if that does happen in Fortnite, we know why.

Second Edit: I believe the Ragnarok skin is the Aesir God Baldr, it says he (the Ragnarok skin) is part of the harbinger set. Baldr is the harbinger of the Ragnarok event. (Harbinger means foreshadowing something basically.) The full description of the skin is ""The cold harbinger of fate"".

Third Edit:

&gt;Baldr had a ship called Hringhorni which was said to be the largest ship ever made (according to Norse mythology). That might be why there is a ship on top of the hill and a new ship glider.

Epic was known for listening to the community and we all loved that because it was the complete opposite of what other BR games offered, but I didn't see any of that ever since they nerfed mats, from there it all went downhill.

Currently the Cruiser Glider is the only item in the Cobra Crew Set. And with my research, I was able to fine that this is the only Set in the game that doesn’t have a skin. So already we’re 100% sure there is going to be a skin that will be released sometime during S5 for the Cobra Crew Set. But wait, there’s more. I searched up Cobras on google and found that cobras originate from India and Southeast Asia. Hmm. I then looked on google for “Countries in Southeast Asia” and found nothing really that important. So I searched up “Indian Mythology” and found MANY possible creature and heroes from that search. So, now I’m going to make a short summary of all the theories I have in mind:

1. A skin about Indian Mythology might be coming to Fortnite in the Cobra Crew Set.

2. Most likely either a Back Bling and/or a Pickaxe is coming with it, which will most likely to into the story. (It’ll most likely be a Legendary/ Epic Skin).

3. This could tie in to what is emerging in Loot Lake. ( It MIGHT be an Indian Temple).

Well that’s my theory leave a comment down below if you have any edits or changes to it

So  i really want trading added to the game (please read the full post before commenting)

The reason i want it is because i want some skins that isn't available anymore. Like red knight Skull tropper crackshot and so on. i dont wnat this to be CS:GO 2.0

Trading.

Like in the picture you can send a offer to someone and they can choose to accept. You need to have created the account in the time where the skin came out. Like before nov. 29 for halloween skins. and before christmas skins to get christmas skins. That way  people can only OG's can get like halloween skins for example. And no trading of free skins or battle pass skins.

Scammers.

I think there's a lot of easy ways to solve this. For example make it so you can enable or disable it on your account and in the start its disabled and you need to make your parnets enable it. Or the trading could take 3 days before it was done. Like both have to accept the trade (maybe with email confirmation) and then there will be 3 days where both can cancel at any time and if not canceled the items will be traded. And only legendarys for legendarys and epic for epic.

Harassing.

If people will add you to trade i think that's fine but not everyone thinks that and thats fair so maybe when you see their account you can see if its enabled or not or make the account private so they cant add you.

Gambling.

Like i said earlier only legendarys for legendarys and epic for epic and so on. Other than that your account need to be a real account like with a win and is playing the game or email confirmation.

Epic games.

so yes i see Epic games could lose money but they could add taxes or what i think is best a max of 3 trades on your account. Epic its not because we dont want to give you our money we just want some skins.

I'm not from an english speaking country :)

I want you guys opinions on this come with questions or ideas .

I am aware this is a battle royale survival game but these changes that can be implemented have no bearing on who gets a victory royale! There are so many easy and harmless changes EPIC has refused to implement that reward/display the amount of kills you have. 

- no kills leaderboard during/after the game. 

This has been suggested forever. I understand that EPIC wants the objective to be to get the victory, but at least having a kills leaderboard at the end of the match would be pretty cool.

- cannot see the # of kills the person you killed has

Just another harmless change. It would be nice to see if the guy you killed had 10 kills or 0 kills etc. or they can at least indicate in the post game leaderboard the # of kills the person you eliminated had. 

- lack of XP gained for kills

This has been touched on in this sub enough. 

Not to mention the amount of streamers/pros that suggested kills should be rewarded more than they are currently in tournament play. These are just some of my thoughts.

I'm looking for websites or channels to follow that can help me improve in the following areas 
- weapon swaps/weapon location 
- Aim consistency/pathing
- Player movement
- Fast farm/loot
- Loot routes
- Rotations 
- Aggression
- Calm and calculated decision making
Also anyone who cares to add me and would want to play that would be awesome! Any advice would be much appreciated!

It seems like the game has turned into a meme game catered to console players, who can’t build as well. SMG’s destroy structures and all I see on this reddit page is people shooting basketballs and building stuff in playground.

It seems like the game has lost all competitiveness. If you still like the game great, but I personally feel like the things that made me love the game are gone. It’s less about skill and tact and more about spraying smg’s. Still fun to some, but not to me. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

I really like the shotgun nerfs, it gives the game variety when it comes to the loadout.

SMG‘s got a buff and are now viable weapons that almost everyone uses, great!

But is it really good to encourage someone to just hold down the trigger with an LMG or and SMG to kill you in a build battle?

I mean, I guess you could say that I could do the same and that everyone can do it. But that makes it a really stale Meta again.

In my opinion double pump (while broken) was at least fun to use. I do not find myself enjoying the game when all I do is hold down the trigger to kill someone while he builds and builds and builds.

Also, the shotguns are in a good place right now, EXCEPT the pump. It needs a little buff.

Either take away the switch delay or make it able to one pump again. With the shotgun to shotgun delay it can’t be abused anymore. But running it right now is puts you at a disadvantage.

So all in all what I wanted to say is that I‘m all for changes that bring variety but buffing one thing and making another OP is not the solution...",FortNiteBR

Solo match XP cap for kills is 50+80= 130.
Solo win = 300.

You get over a third of the xp you get for a win. A win only “technically” requires 1 kill. 

Say let’s bump it to no cap 10 xp per kill. 10 kills would be 50+100=150. Wow 20 xp? Okay okay not enough. 20 xp/kill reddit demands it! 

50+10(20) = 250

250 xp for kills? Now you’re just playing CoD since getting kills give equal xp as a win.

People don’t want to grind so you complain about kill xp? Just play the game.

The answer is a win shop. It’s been posted on here so many times in different ways it’s the only answer that adds something to the game without having to revamp the entire xp system.",FortNiteBR

Every so often, you may luck out and get something most players don’t have or may never get, such as the Skull Trooper. Other times you have a Red Knight and not everyone and your grandmother has it. Well it’s a game and some people can get whatever they want with enough time and money.

If we are allowed to gift skins, this game will decline to scams like StW. Let’s say some body will give Sky Stalker for Cuddle Team Leader. The Cuddle   Team Leader guy gets the Sky Stalker. The Sky Stalker guy will likely receive nothing back.
**#Reason 2**
People will end up getting skins that are considered OG or show skill. It would ruin the OG factor. I call it the “Red Knight Effect”. It would be inevitable for the skull trooper to end up in some noobs hands.

Explosives feel so OP and specifically c4, people say ""adapt"", well I can't when I can't build because when I try to build everything just ends up blown to bits and trying to kill him is not and option since the guy will just build. But why don't you just do the same, he's probably got more fucking c4 and just blow me up, die to fall damage from falling 1m in the air. The recent buff to launchers &amp; rpg's is fine because more people use them rather then wishing they didn't get one from a supply drop. Miniguns are annoying as fuck because some wanker will just stand their holding m1 while I'm just frantically trying to defend myself while sweatting in places I shouldn't sweat, ""why don't you rush him?"", because that thing is a fucking laser. Shotguns in general really feel useless, the double pump nerf was expected and is good because this game requires more skill but I feel like lately I'm shit(which probs is the case) or shotguns pellets are replaced with beanbags and hitting people for 16,15 and 13 on headshots which are good numbers when I'm trying to win a lottery, not play a broken video game. The Meta is probably the worst thing with smgs being pretty OP and actually laser the shit out of people. Just don't see a diverse meta and smg's seem a little to op tbh imo. Llamas seem useless and everything else in the game seems fine apart from stating that the top of carts are bouncepads but you still take fall dmg, either remove it or make it so you take no fall dmg. Makes 0 sense.

Solutions:

\- Limit the amount of C4 a person can carry, maybe 6 idk

\- Minguns should have a cooldown, like if you use it for a certain amount of time give it a heat up effect and then wait for it to cooldown again before using it, idk what the duration should be and how long the cooldown should be

\- I honestly have no idea about shotguns, just don't use one? or buff them a tiny bit? Idk

\- Supressed needs to be less accurate, not huge but a tiny bit, tac smgs should have a smaller clip or longer reload time? idk

\- Llamas should have 300 of each material, good middle point

* Game freezes : This one is really big, it actually has made me die more than once. When you land and pick up your first gun, the game freezes for like a second or two almost every game. It also happens randomly sometimes in fights depending on the location. This had never happened to me before Season 5 and it's quite frustrating

* Texture loading issues : Also a bug that wasn't there before S5, some textures take quite some time to load. Like a REALLY long time. I play duo with my best friend he had like 30s of texture not loading in Paradise at some point

* No stats : Well this one isn't new, but we don't have any kind of stats tab on the Switch version

* FPS drops in crowded areas : Not sure this one can be fixed, but we get some nasty FPS drops if the area we land in is somewhat crowded. Knowing that is happened on Xbox One and PS4 when landing tilted, not sure Epic can do much on the less powerful Switch. But it still happens in places not as famous as tilted such as Salty and I know Epic are amazing when it comes to optimizing their game so maybe they can figure something out.

* Console crashing when not leaving a game : I don't know if Epic can do much on this one, but if you die/win a game and you shut your switch down without leaving the server before and going back to the main menu, your Switch is pretty much crashed and you have to fully reboot it. 

If my fellow Switch players have some more suggestions, feel free!",FortNiteBR

As of the new season patch (season 5), every time you launch the game for the first time (after booting up pc) a blue screen occurs.

My (and others) computers bluescreen on launch of fortnite.","Here is a forum post describing the issue and how many people have it:    https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/technical-support/hardware-support/498781-blue-screen-system-thread-exception-not-handled

It is really bad that epic will not even comment on this widespread issue. It has occured repeatedly since season 5's release.

Here is, in order starting from me booting my PC, what happens:

1. PC boots, I log in, windows starts up normally.   
2. I browse the internet for a bit, maybe play another game.   
3. I open Fortnite.  
4. Instantly, blue screen with the error in the forum post.   

To avoid the glitch/blue screen:

1. PC boots, I log in, windows starts up normally.   
2. I open Fortnite immediately after startup

A blue screen is much more than just an inconvenience. This is a major issue that needs to be fixed. Also, the fact that it has been on the forums for a while without a response shows that we really have to find other ways (such as Reddit) to bring issues to Epic's attention.",FortNiteBR

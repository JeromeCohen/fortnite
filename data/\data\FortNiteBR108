**This should be opt-in, to make everyone happy.  Even those who are against it.**

There should be various options added into the user's settings menu for matchmaking.

*(I refer to ""lobby"" as the ACTUAL lobby, where you choose your game mode)*   
*(When I say ""lobby"", I* ***do not*** *mean an active match)*

Some such as ...

**Balanced**

* Strictly enforced SBMM.
* You ONLY get matched with players of similar skill.
* You ONLY get matched with players of similar play-style.

**Competitive / Ranked**

* You get matched against the sweatiest of players.
* You earn some kind of reward or perk for wins  ( 5 VBucks / win? )
* If you got a win, you get a permanent lobby badge.  Similar to how it shows if you have Battle Pass.

**Scrim**

* Perfect for streamers who run scrims/snipes.
* This is to separate scrim matches against normal matches.
* No enforced SBMM, so everyone can get in the same game.
* Keeps the normal modes fun and non-sweaty.

**Royale**

* For people who prefer it the way it is now.  
* *CURRENT* matchmaking.
* Get matched with anyone, regardless of skill rating.
* No enforced SBMM.
* Get matched against new/casual/average/sweaty/pro players

\*\*\_\_Contrary to popular and misguided belief, SBMM does not actually slow matchmaking down, if done right.\_\_\*\*  
Considering there are millions of people who play Fortnite, with \*\*\_\_so much\_\_\*\* difference in skill, no, it will not take ""10 million years"" to find a match.  And, if you're still sketchy, the ""Royale"" option mentioned above would be ""0 delay"".  


So, how can we determine a person's skill rating?

Several ways!!

**Research and calculate the following (""Skill rating"" / Matchmaking ""score""):**

* Average eliminations per- game/week/month/overall  (and how they get their kills)
* Average headshots per- game/week/month/overall  (and with what weapon used)
* Average hit accuracy per- game/week/month/overall
* Average survival-time overall  (staying alive through several storm phases)
* Kills, Deaths, Wins  ( Season AND overall )
* Average Build speed  (Rapidly switching between: floors and walls and ramps)
* Average game placement per- game/week/month/overall

&amp;#x200B;

**Weapon &amp; Aim Accuracy Tracking**

*I feel like this should be a factor in determining skill.* *Based on how you use weapons, and how good you are with them.*

So, if you're great with a sniper?  Cool!  (And distance of successful shots) Always land shotgun headshots?  Nice! Primarily SMG spam?  Ew, but to each their own. Prefer explosives even ...?  Neat.

**And, in terms of long-range, non-sniper ...** *(This applies to the AR, Scar, AK, etc)*

* Do you selectively shoot shots slowly and smart?
* Do you just outright waste your whole clip lasering?
* Do you consistently shoot out builds?
* Do you prefer to use your AR as opposed to an SMG for close-range?
* How consistently do you actually land your shots?  Even from VERY far away?

All of these factors can go in-tie with determining a skill-ratio.  
So, even if you're not a good builder and don't have the best stats ... 

Having great aim alone can add some degree of factor in skill-ratio.

You could be rewarded for better, more sportsman-like, smarter gameplay... Such as carefully taking your time with shots.  As opposed to cheap tactics say, lasering / SMG spam.  


But having good aim alone **should not** ""boost"" you in the skill-tree much!!As some players (myself) hate building, we don't want to get matched with over-builders.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Please EPIC put more thought into your new additions to the game! Stop forcing such radical changes! I don't have a problem with adapting to change, it's  that this game is becoming less and less enjoyable with each new ""addition""!

From the [nomination thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ahgtay/rfortnitebr_1_million_subscriber_celebration/eeeg65z/):

&gt; Pencils of Promise has built over 500 schools around the world for 250 million children who lack basic reading, writing and math skills. When it comes to being an elite builder Pencils of Promise has serious building skills, and schools kids everyday like we all wish we could. Seriously, this charity builds schools in places like Ghana, Guatemala and Laos and allows kids to get education.

### [Here is the link to our CrowdRise donation page!](https://www.crowdrise.com/o/en/campaign/fortnitebr1million)

### Mods vs. Community Event

Using community-created maps from our sister sub /r/FortniteCreative, we will pit the /r/FortniteBR subscribers against the moderators on January 26th and 27th in Creative Mode. Starting at noon EST on both days, we’ll use the [/r/FortniteBR discord](https://discord.gg/FortniteBR) to coordinate matches. Users will compete against the mods on team deathmatch or free-for-all maps, and we’ll rotate users in and out along with participating mods. 

###Dates

January 26th and 27th

### Times

Starting at noon EST, with end time around 3 or 4 PM EST each day.

### Servers

We will have two lobby VCs: NA and EU

### How it Works

We’ll ping in the discord server when we are starting a lobby, announcing the map and game type. Spots for each match will be first come, first serve in the VCs. Anywhere from 2-5 mods should be in each match to ensure plenty of community members can play. 

### Prizes

We have Epic-themed prizes and Reddit Coins for the games. SteelSeries has also returned to donate prizes for charity donations!

Epic-themed prizes and Reddit Coins will be awarded on a map-by-map basis. We’ll announce how to win in discord before each map. Both winners and random participants are eligible to win these prizes, so be sure to play!

### Prize Breakdown

Epic-themed prizes: 15 swag packs, each containing a hat, shirt, and a pin
Reddit Coins: Silver, Gold, and Platinum
SteelSeries: 3 packs containing [Arctis 5](https://steelseries.com/gaming-headsets/arctis-5), [Rival 310](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mice/rival-310), [QcK+](https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-plus-limited), [M750 TKL](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-m750-tkl)
[Delivery restrictions for SteelSeries](https://imgur.com/a/8vdwkSP)

### How to Win

The Epic-themed prizes and Reddit Coins will be selected from a pool of users who participate in Mods vs. Community matches over the weekend, as well as the winners of those matches. 

For **every $1 USD** donated to our Pencils of Promise charity drive between now and 2/1, 12:00am EST, you will receive 1 entry into the drawing. The drawing will be recorded and posted with the winners approximately 1 week after the charity drive ends. We will be reaching out to the winners no later than February 15th, and they must confirm response within 48 hours of being contacted or the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Contact will be made through the email provided when donating to the charity drive. All 3 SteelSeries prize packs will be in this drawing.

*You may only win a donated prize one time. In the event a winner is chosen and they do not meet the delivery requirements of a prize they won, we will first work with them to attempt to have the prize shipped to a valid delivery address. We will make every attempt to work with them to get them their prize. If no conclusion can be reached, the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Unfortunately, with the nature of this drawing and complexity involved, this is the best option. Additionally, all winners must be comfortable sharing their shipping address with a moderator.*

All items were donated by their respective companies, for the community, to enjoy, in support of our 1 million subscribers event.

I’ve had about 4 solo wins and 3 of em are mind, like 4 duos and 30 squads, I come on this game everyday in hopes my ability will suddenly pickup but i just disappoint myself time after time again!

1) Less pet back blings (I just think they’re stupid and bulky) and replace them with weapon wraps or just regular back blings.

2) A tier 100 skin that isn’t lame.

3) Do away with multi stage challenges or at least allow us to complete multiple stages in one match. Unlike some people, I work and go to school so I don’t have all damn day to do challenges. 

4) Place the BP skin upgrade challenges at the bottom or make them a separate screen (where you toggle left/right on the challenge screen). Petty, I know, but as a controller player it is super annoying to have to toggle pass them or collapse them in order to get to the weekly challenges.

It still remains a mystery to this day, but after the most recent live event, we finally have enough pieces to place together, and lets just say, I honestly did not expect this, but this theory makes much sense when you look at it. This is the final theory that I have on this (maybe). So lets get into it.

&amp;#x200B;

The story really began back at the start of Season 5. The day when the Rift's came when the rocket launched took an unexpected turn...or did it? You see the rocket launch was created my Omen and Faith, in hopes to destroy Tilted Towers and cause more mayhem. But around that time...the visitor crashed from space in a meteorite. The visitor wanted to get home, so he made his way over Omen's evil lair. He then modified the rockets to intentionally create the Rift's. The Visitor's plan was to use the rift created from the rocket to make his way home, which we assume is what actually happened since we no longer see the visitor again. With the Visitor home, the rifts continued the sabotage things in the world, including a lot of stuff on the battle royal island. But here is where things start to get really spicy. As you all know, the ""cube"" was summoned by a rift, landing is paradise. Nobody knows where exactly the cube came from, but now we do know. In season 7, during the live event, the ice king was seen holding a fragment of Kevin. So my theory is that Kevin the cube was from the place where The Ice King has come from, and Kevin was a valuable resource in the Ice King's home land. When Kevin was taken away with a Rift, this caused the Ice King to set sail for the place that Kevin has landed. The Battle Royal Island. Maybe even the one who decided to go after Kevin was Lynx, or maybe Sgt. Winter, because as we know, the Ice King was in his deep slumber. We dont know who was trying to find Kevin, but we know that someone was. As Kevin traveled the Battle Royal island, it did its cube things like you saw in the game, eventually, its evil essence began to leak out (which you saw in the live event). Kevin started to loose its evil color (shortly after Fortnitemares because of it spawning so many evil things). As the essence of evil started to run out, Kevin was filled with regret, and then decided to repay everyone by creating the new loot lake. The reason the snow storm is here is because they are in search of Kevin. the cube that is no longer here. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you combine this with my previous theory, it honestly does make sense together. This is my last theory on this subject maybe, so see you all later.",FortNiteBR

\- You can activate this item at any time, provided that the ally hasn't left the match - It will make more sense for your party members continue to watch, because they can comeback;

Season 3 is when I played a bit more but not too much, enough to get wins but not enough to be really invovled in the community.

&amp;#x200B;

Then comes season 4, I played a decent bit more, i was involved in the community and was watching alot of streamers, but I was still an average skilled player then,

Late season 4 I started taking the game seriously, i was constantly looking for ways to improve and once season 5 started i'd like to think i was better than the average player. i played almost 24/7. Then in late august (i'm guessing late season 5) I quit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hated the p90 meta and i was getting bored of the game. I never really cared to watch anything related to fortnite and i lost all interest. I new about the events because of my siblings talking about it but never cared.

Now i'm playing consistently, probably how I was playing mid season 4.

I can't seem to get any wins or games with 5 or more kills. I'm pretty sure I have most of my skill back but i'm struggling alot.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you guys could tell me the new meta or give me some practice tips or something like that. I'm having more fun with the game now and wanna be as good as I was before.",FortNiteBR

Ran into back to back aimbots wearing battlepass skins from season 3. 

I’d like to start with a disclaimer: I play a lot... probably way too much. So my experience with this issue may be more pronounced than the average player. Also title is a bit clickbaity sorry. 

I’m convinced that easy anti cheat and Battleye aren’t really protecting against anything past the first page of results for “fortnute aimbot” on google. 

Almost every other day I play solo pubs now I run into some sort of blatant cheat. All sorts of cheats, from the “dink dink dink dead” kind to the flying quadglitcher. But there are obvious patterns of similar cheats that stick around for weeks on end. 

And I know, I know, complaining about it here won’t do any good but my experience tonight was enough to make me at least have to vent it here. 

Back to back games – Killed by 2 different aimbots – blatant aimbots too, didn’t even need to check replay, just knew to spectate them after dying in 0.2 seconds from 200 health. 

I guess the worst part is just that it’s not even clever, no switching it off or trying to hide it in any way. Just gallivanting around in their season 3 and 4 skins not missing a single shot and trying to look like they know how to build. 

And I realize that preventing these cheats is no small feat; and it’s likely not epic games’ MO to announce exactly what they are doing to stop them. But whatever they are doing is no longer working. I mean... Tfue can barely play a pop up cup without getting stream sniped by a cheater. There will always be the occasional clever cheater in any competitive video game, that’s unavoidable. And that’s how it was in earlier seasons, but currently they are just so prolific and so painfully obvious that it’s actually starting to deter me from playing as much. 

So I guess the only real question left to ask is: can the guys at EAC, battleye, and epic stay ahead of cheating or do I need to start shopping around for a better gaming chair?

So i quitted two weeks ago because Epic pretty much ruined the game in my opinion. Planes, skins that dont match the fortnite astetic, broken gameplay etc. But my no. 1 reason was because of Epic not listening to the real daily players.. but instead focusing on the player who are new/bad by giving them acces to OP guns/items and just trying to “make it work” for everyone. This game is evolving and so is the playerbase. The guy with 2.1kd in season 2 has either quit playing or has a 4.6kd right now. It is what it is, i think its because this epic’s first reallly big game.. but they should just link with the community and test things out. (SHOOTING TEST 3 WE STILL WAITING).

Anyway, since i quit. All of epics “propaganda” dissapeared after 10 days. Its really noticeable.. no ads no suggestions. Has anyone else had this? It’s like youre back to 2017 where there was no fortnite xd pretty scary imo",FortNiteBR

Aim is not needed, considering the radius of the explosion, you just have to hit the rocket near the opponent.

Good building is not needed, just hold down the trigger while facing the enemies general direction.


A weapon this skill less does not belong in a game like Fortnite.

The way people just spray rockets at you just ruins the game. The game should leave you on edge, excited and thrilled. Not frustrated that a bad player is abusing a terrible weapon against and actually winning.


 I understand people will tell me to adapt, but here me out. The game is about having fun, and no matter what side of the story I’m on with the rocket launcher, it’s not fun.

If I am the one barraging the enemy with rockets, I don’t enjoy myself because I know I don’t deserve the kill.
If I am being barraged I don’t enjoy myself because it’s stressful and frustrating.

Therefore if nobody enjoys themselves using it, it shouldn’t exist.

I  bought the battle pass a week ago but have completed all challenges and am only on tier 60. Maybe the stars from level up and weekly challenges play a big part in this.

If you also leave a comment on what you think the avg tier would be if someone had played since the start of the season and had not bought tiers.

Because I know I am.,"I know I am. And just to clarify, I do love epic and this game and how they release updates weekly. But, I've been playing since season 3 and honestly need a break. This game does not feel fun to me anymore, it feels more of a chore. When I buy the battle pass, I'm in reality buying work I have to commit to or else I won't get my money's worth.

Despite being a legendary John Wick when memes surrounding the skin were huge 8 months ago, I've never found myself really improving in this game. Sure, I went from ""Noob"" to ""Average"" but never went beyond average. I still can't build well or build battle at all, I've gotten better at aiming but my max kills in a single game ever has been 10 in high explosives a few months ago. In a normal solos game, my max kills is 8. People who have been playing since season 4 or even season 5 are now so good that they can easily get 15+ kills a game and have an over 10% chance of a victory royale in any given game. And me, my max kills ever is 10, and I've only gotten 20 wins total, most of which were not solo wins. They still feel super special to me whenever I get one.

And then there's Epic Game's history here. Fortnite was hugely popular in season 2 and 3 because of the game's growing population, and it was growing because of epic and how good they were with their game and community. Then they started to get worse and slip every few times. Season five was a fucking nightmare and a half that lasted 2 months. People were taking their break from the game back then, and I definitely should've. If I just knew what that season was and how this communuity devolved into the saltiest, sweatiest toxic whiny brats I've ever witnessed, possibly the most extreme case in the history of the Earth, I would've left and never looked back until the Halloween season came. Not to mention the ""other mode"" where you protect the planet from zombies was also a fucking mess during that time, r/FORTnITE was worse than the battle royale ever could've been since I play both game modes. But the planet protecting gamemode will always be inferior to the money hungry Epic Games, so I doubt they'll ever fix the big issues with it. I could complain further but this isn't r/FORTnITE, and they've already done that for me at least 100 times.

It seems like season 7 is a repeat of season 5, if not on a little smaller scale. The community is starting to lose their shit at Epic again, and for good reason. Epic hasn't been very well at listening to the community lately, and on the times that they have, they weren't as fast or as good about it back in the good old days of season 2 and 3 when epic was much better at things. There's metas again, epic is nerfing and buffing the wrong things, and people are starting to get upset again. I really think I need to take a break from this game, I've been playing every season since season 3 and bought the battle pass for every one. When I get the ice king, I'm out.

By the way, **I will still play during season 8**, but not nearly as much, and I certainly won't be buying the battle pass. Not paying for extra work for a 3rd time since BPs were only fun for the first 2 I played through, the rest were just work for cosmetic emoticons and junk I'll never use. This could be another rant about how BP items have gotten worse since the iconic season 2-4 ones but I'm not making this thread that. Bottom line is, I'm taking a break and going to play this a lot less and focus on having fun rather than forcing myself to play a game I don't like because I'm not having fun.

**Tl;dr** - Played constantly and bought every battle pass from seasons 3-7 without ever taking a break, even through the clusterfuck that was season 5. I'm taking a break and will still play, but a lot less and wont buy the battle pass. I decided this at the start of season 7 that this will be my last one. Who is with me here and also taking a break?",FortNiteBR

I hate the fact that most are based off luck, like explosive kills or other item-based challenges. I hate the challenges involving damage with oddly specific items. I hate the fact that I have to complete multiple stages that I can't complete in the same match. It's stupid and wasteful of my precious time. I have exams, and schoolwork, and I find it stupid that if I want tier 100, rather than playing and getting them with skill, I have to resort to spending a day that I could spend trying to play and get good at the game. Overall, challenges detract from the gameplay, as you have to pause what you are doing to complete a tedious task.

What I propose is the following...

\-Have all challenges available from the first week, but makes the free tiers and loading screens available with each week still.

\-remove all specific item-based challenges, instead replace them with weapon type based kills, however boost the amount needed, as they will all be available from the start

These would be examples of challenges:

Get wins (Not stupid deathmatch-type modes): 5 (40 Battle-stars), 10 (60 Battle-stars), 15 (100 Battle-stars), 20 (200 Battle-stars)

Get kills with {weapon type}: \_\_\_/25-150 kills | 50 Battle-stars per categorie (example: Pistols, Shotguns ex.)

Get kills with Traps: 5 (15 Battle-stars) 10 (20 Battle-stars) 25 (50 Battle-stars)

Travel Meters in vehicles: 50,000 (60 Battle-Stars)

Kills: \_\_\_/500 (100 Battle-stars)

Harvest Materials: \_\_\_\_\_\_/50,000 (100 Battle-stars)

&amp;#x200B;

You get the point, challenges that are ***ACTUAL CHALLENGES***, stuff that takes time and skill to complete, while still having a couple that don't require it, but still are obtained from playing the actual game, not ignoring it. This would make the game more enjoyable for players who are interested in being rewarded for playing, and would make people actually try and play. I have friends who log in to do the challenges and log off as soon as their done, and don't care to keep playing as they get bored after having to slog through the challenges. This form of challenge would also give a reward to dedicated and good players, encouraging others to keep trying to improve. Overall this would create a more fun to play game, as the focus would be on the gameplay, rather than tedious quests that detract from the intended game.

&amp;#x200B;

Please leave your thoughts below, and what you would do. I would like to create a discussion around this to maybe improve the game.

I suggest a small buff to anyone near an Ice Shard. It can be extra shield, hit points, maybe even a slight weapon buff, anything that might make another player hesitate to shoot someone who is just farming kills.

1. The Ice Shard doesn't last forever and nobody can build a base around one since the Legion will destroy anything that's placed near them once a player is in the vicinity. 
2. Nobody can say it's unfair as your enemy also has to deal with the Legion on their backs.

Adding friendly fire would make the game so much more fun in my opinion.

Ex: in squads you wouldn't be able to have one/two players spam rockets/grenades while the others rush with no repercussions. It would make the battles require way more skill than currently when explosives are involved.  Along with that it would increase the awareness needed of where your teammates are (I remember many times pumping my teammates/getting pumped by teammates when we both come around a corner unexpectedly.  Actually hilarious when it happens lmao.)

&amp;#x200B;

I believe it was taken out because of people killing their teammates in random duos/squads.  An easy fix someone suggested before would be that friendly fire is only on when enemies are within X amount of meters.  Obviously you could still get killed on purpose by toxic teammates, but I think it would greatly reduce it.",FortNiteBR

2) Ice Storm Challenges

3) Battle Pass Challenges

Im feeling almost burned out having to balance this with my reallife job also, challenges take too long to finish, and if you want to play other game modes (eg. sniper ltm etc.) it becomes a chore rather than fun. At first they were fun to do, but after a couple of seasons you see this more as ""work"" instead of just ""fun"", and you only do it for the reward which you obviously don't want to miss out on. In order to get the rank 100 Battle Pass Reward you also have to do the dailies, and you will be chasing these challenges rather than actually playing the game and having fun the way you want. I find it so tedious and Im surprised not more people are complaining how time-consuming and tedious these challenges have become. Am I the only one ? I can't be. Even a friend of mine started paying another guy, just to finish the challenges for him, so he can just play the game as he normally would when he comes home from work. I understand it's mostly teens/ and younger people playing the game, probably having enough time on their hands, but when you come home from work and want to just have a little fun and relax, you dont want to open the game having the guilty feeling of being forced to do ""work"" again and  boring tasks to get a certain limited reward. My solution would be that the time-amount would be one third 1/3 of what it was before, so it isn't as time consuming as now. Especially talking about the recent 2 event challenges.",FortNiteBR

I m a tryhard and I prefer a short and aggressive game over a long and boring game. Since the arrival of Zombies and Fog , spotting enemies has become a much harder thing. I usually land at Tilted or Salty. Tilted is no more a fun place because of that fog and zombies. Surroundings of Tilted (Loot Lake , Stadium/Vikings) are now abandoned.

I dropped at Salty , killed 9 and a total of 77 people were still left. I thought I would be able to break my record (23) in that game. I quickly rotated out , ran here and there but fog didn't allow me to see anyone. I killed about 100 zombies. Eventually , I reached top 15. And guess what ? I didn't find anyone ! Believe me , I m very sharp at spotting enemies. Slightest of glimpse and I spot them. But ran through whole map , found no one.

15 ppl were left , finally came across a Default. We had a good fight. I was left on 26hp with storm just behind my back. Started putting on a medkit. 4-5 secs were remaining and a horde of god damn zombies came , compelling me to stop healing , as I finished them , started healing , storm got me.

Fortnite was so much fun without fog. We had to care a lot about 3rd parties , about at every corner , we encountered ppl. Players were landing almost in every paett of map. Despite be it Lucky , Vikings , Lazy , Block or Paradise. People just land and disappear now. 

P.S , I went into replay mode to see where everybody went in that game and believe me ... I went past like 10-12 people around Salty , neither they nor I were able to spot. Fog is so much annoying !

And what do you do in winter? You add them back, for a holiday that arguably has nowhere near anything to do with zombies. The game is terrible, you can't have a normal 1v1. Because zombies are breaking down your builds, as if rocket launchers weren't already op. And on top of that, it's foggy, meaning that you can't see past 2 metres in front of you! Seriously! All it would take to fix this is if they had a normal playlist, regular solos duos and squads. And another ice storm playlist. It's so simple yet you still make terrible choices.",FortNiteBR

Suggestion nr. 1

1st: remove planes ability to shoot
2nd; make plane crash to players harmles
3rd make planes just a vehicle to move faster around the map

Suggestion nr. 2

If epic want planes to shoot then make the damage 10/shot.
Make the overheat every 2-3 seconds so they cant spray
And lastly reduce the health of airplanes from 800 to 500

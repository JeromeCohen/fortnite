But now it's kinda the same thing over and over again. All that happens is a new corner of the map changes, a new battle pass with skins I will barely ever use, needing to grind weekly challenges just for another skin I will hardly ever use (Besides Ruin that thing is good) and waiting for when the one major event of the season will happen.

TL;DR every season has brought the same kinds of changes and I'm not very hyped for Season 9",FortNiteBR

Also, will make a separate post with video included of the absurdity that solo-no crossplay is at the moment. +50 games and I have yet to find a solo.

See an enemy pushing a cannon? Stand in front. Let them do 100 damage.

See an enemy get in a cannon? Build something for them to break through.

Does your circle include zip-lines? Ride the zip-lines back and forth letting enemies tag you.

Give OG stage 5’s a bonus, too.","1.	I haven’t seen an Omega in-game in months. I’m not sure if this means less “OG’s” or that people don’t care about it anymore.
2.	Not having stage 5 and unlocking the colors makes the skin feel “incomplete” and a lot of people would rather just not wear it at all than just wear red stage 4.
3.	Getting to XP level 80 in a single season was incredibly time consuming, and if you took two or three weeks off from the game (such as prepping for finals), you were doomed.
4.	Every unlockable skin since has challenges that last past the season, probably because of how many people complained (even during season 3)
5.	Changing colors was a community suggestion, and it ended up being implemented for only a portion of the active players during that season.  
6.	This upcoming season, based on the teasers, looks like Omega will be right at home.

These are the main reasons that I think Epic should re-introduce Omega challenges for anyone who didn’t cap them out in S3. Anyone who did should receive a new Omega color...blue.  

I don’t expect this suggestion to gain a ton of traction, but as someone who only has Omega level 4 themselves, it’s been a sore point for a while.",FortNiteBR

So we are now at the end of season 8 and just as at the end of any season , we have gotten two of the three teasers for the next season . So by looking at the two teasers we have gotten till now , we can be sure with one thing , the theme for season 9 is gonna be futuristic themed , at least thats what the captions with those photos indicate . So assuming that there are gonna be only 3 teasers , the last one which will drop today will have the final word . Till now by combining the two teasers we get ‘NE’ . And i have been hearing a lot of speculation about what the third word will be and i think that it will be the alphabet ‘O’ . Combine these together and we get the sentence ‘NEO’ . Now what does ‘NEO’ mean ? Well ‘NEO’ means anything that is revised , modernised , or , ‘rebuilt’ . So my theory is that Tilted towers is going to be rebuilt and modernised and so is retail row . Bit hold up , i also stated ‘rebuilt’ . And by second theory is based on this word . Remember how a couple of weeks ago dusty divot started getting filled up with some lava ? So i think that it will keep on progressing with getting filled up . And hopefully in season 9 the entire divot will get filled up with lava and as time progresses, the lava will cool down and form rocks , and and maybe DUSTY DEPOT might be rebuilt on that layer of rocks along with the OG factories .

The reason I don’t personally want it is because there is so much potential with this. Think of what you could do. You could make a floating city, you could have the middle building with tons of portals, you could add like code blocks (I’ll work on the name) that give players speed and high jump. So having a modern tilted seems like an absolute waist. By no means would it be bad, it could be good if pulled off correctly, but it would be much better if epic started a new concept.

But the Blade was balanced, well after you couldn't farm mats. But you should be able to and carry about 250 to at least have a fighting chance (while all this you're supposed to be a mythic being while holding it. But I only feel like I die to someone with an SMG.) I don't want to go into much but I made a huge Reddit post a little while ago explaining how things should be with the Blade. I'll leave that below but my main point is ***why does the Blade get show much hate?***

If we really want to hate on something, can we hate on the Drum Gun please?

Double shotguns went OP only the people who didn't know how to use them (the noobs) were complaining all the way back in season 2,3 and 4 fortnite has changed so it since then and people have gotten a lot better and we also have a second option you can run if you don't want to use double shotguns we have another viable option shotgun smg/drum gun

2. Fortnite really needs something that the better people of fortnite can use because I think one of the main reasons why fortnite is dying is because of the constant addition to please the casual players with easy to use op items. Planes,drum gun, the sword and I'm sure there is more adding back double shotguns would be very good for the community and I can guarantee that everyone would like it.

3. How to make it not to good. I think the best version of double shotguns were at the start of season 4, in my opinion the best season of fortnite. I think epic should also get rid of the one pump capability if double shotguns do make a return. 

4. Adding double shotguns will defently balance out the drum gun and will please the not so good players by keeping te drum gun in and the pros by bringing in double shotguns.

5. This has nothing to do with double shotguns but I think epic should definitely take some advice from season 4 and look at all the great things that happened in the season like bouncers an have aloof at what made that battle pass absolutely amazing. Epic should also get rid of dusty divot no one likes it no one lands there it's just been the same old trees for 4 seasons now. It was cool when it first came out with hop rocks and everything. Also I think that they should make the snow area of the map a bit smaller I don't really like how much o te map is just snow. Keep It in just make it smaller. I think ballers are perfectly fine in normal fortnite as really enjoy then just not in arena and competitive in general it just to easy to hide in trees and houses with them and whenever the storm moves just bring them to the ring take no damage and hide again and get easy placements. I've also been playing since season 2 so I kind if know what's been good for the game at what isn't if epic reads this and implements it into season 9 not necessarily straight away he game would be really great like it used to be.

I started to get pretty good at the game by season 5. I was getting around 3 to 5 wins a day playing with random squads and averaging around 6 to 10 and sometimes up to 15 kills a game. I . stopped playing season 6 because they did not update the map and I was tired of the old layout I started back up season 7 and was not as good as I was season 5 but still was decent. Then I stopped playing season 7 around 4 weeks into the season because the game was getting stale and I was not feeling the snow biome. I started back up season 8 and everyone was extremely good. In season 8 Im lucky to get 3 kills. Everyone is just so good now and I do not have the time to play the game all the time to try to get better. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is I am building better than I was in season 5 when I was racking in tons of kills, the player base just drastically got better at the game. To the point that I am not even enjoying the game that much anymore because I am garbage now. I played a game of team rumble today and people were sweating their balls off in it. Like team rumble should be the most laid back game mode. Does anyone else feel the same, that the game is too competitive now and just is not as fun as it was back in the good old days?

I forgot how this even started, but apparently everyone likes headhunter so much that it turned into a fetish? It's literally a character in a fucking kids game. Stop fantising over Headhunter and get a girlfriend or something. Almost every new female skin that came out this season has been Headhunter.



Epic, please for the love of God, just stop listening to these 9 year olds who have a crush on a girl in your video game. Give us some variety in cosmetics. I want to spend money in your game, but I'm just so sick of headhunter. 



Remember Banshee? Mari? Ramirez? Hell, just even make new female models then. I remember when every other new female skin was Ramirez. Now it's Headhunter. Please just stop with Headhunter skins.

I wanna keep it as short as Possible. This should be a friendly discussion Post and not a hate post. Upvote or Downvote it, idc, but lets talk about it like real adults. So i've questioned myself when did Fortnite start to get worse and worse? It all started with Playground. Turbo Build on it's on wasn't the big problem, but from Time to Time, people went more to Playground (Myself included) to practice every Build and Edit you need to learn to become a Pro. But that was the moment where it all started to go down. I mean, imagine beeing a noob and you're just playing for Fun, and all of a Sudden you encounter Ttv_SocCeRsKin731 that makes a 6-layer Ramp rush? Don't get me wrong, i'm that Soccerskin who can even do the Thanos Ramprush from Beaks 😂 but just imagine beeing that noob. After the same sh*t happens over and over again, you would just be annoyed by it, no wonder that there are only us Sweats left. Turbo Build was the Ruin of Fortnite with a Good intetion behind it. But the Combination with Playground and Creative ruined the fun of the Game. Turbo build is also the reason why our FPS are f*cked up. Our Fps isn't that bad just because they changed some little things to the Graphics. Don't get me wrong guys, as i already mentioned, i'm a very skilled Player like a lot of you guys are to, but i mean don't you miss those times where a Build fight was fun like the one summit and myth had? I'm just annoyed having to double cone with floor, edit, then side jump with a cone just to get 90 on again and again. I can do all of this, i can do Infinite 90's to the sky but am i having fun doing this? No, definitley not, and i guess a lot of you guys think the same. Or those Turbobuild holder, those are the worst. I mean if it's a scrim, well, do so, why not, but bro, in a Pub? Really? I still have a footage of me breaking down the walls of an opponent for roughly 5 min and 27 sec.  Doesn't sound that long? Test it out in playground, you'll see how long i had to break down the walls to get him out the box. All those people are just playing Passiv AF, waiting for you to swing just to edit and one pump you or to just make the smallest mistake, but during that they never leave their box. Of course i'm doing this too sometimes, but why? I am literally forced to, because as soon as i start to play aggressive, i run in to people that do exactly what i described and i get punished for playing the game like it should be played. Back then we had at least our exploits where you could counter this, but now every exploit is gone beside the one on top of the cone with the wall, but if you do this one, you just get trapped. 

So now, to cut a long story short, should Turbo Build be removed, nerfed or should it stay as it is? What's your opinion on that. And please, let's discuss this like adults and not like some angry 5 year olds",FortNiteBR

So let's act on this assumption, they are spelling NEO. This, for me. Means some drastic across the map changes. Examples.


Tilted towers or whatever is built on its location will be a post futuristic structure, imagine neon lights, light coloured buildings and lots of flat angular shapes. Same with Retail row, modern shopping center ""Or mall for Americans"" with loads of buildings in the interior presuming both stay the same thing as they were, just changed aesthetically. 

Going a step further we could presume the side of the iceberg collapses into greasy causing the ice to smash and the castle to begin falling in on itself. We can presume if this happens an entire section of the map would be flooded, near the Viking village, who we already know are expanding across the map using the coast to the West. 

If this happens I can genuinely see the boat crashing down into greasy and making a new POI which is Viking ship, which is floating on the water trying to spread their influence and eventually converting the entire South West of the map to the ""Viking"" stylings we've got this far 

This would make the story for next season, In my opinion. Old world VS new world. Vikings on one side with Neo stylings on the other and the season ending with the vault opening with 2 possible outcomes.

Progress with NEO story - Entire map becomes futuristic and the story continues with it heading further from reality, hoverboards, laser guns, and jetpacks with robots and AI.

OR change it back to how it was before the visitor. Older style story with more castles or even not as drastic with modern styling similar to season 5 or 6. Allowing the community to progress forward into the future, or back to the past.


Some things that may corrolate with this includes.

Developer in season 3 mentioning the story was completed until season 9.

Mentions of allowing the community to have more input over changes in the future including entire storylines.



This is pretty in-depth and honestly large conclusions for me to jump to, but imagining atleast some of this is true. But I'm interested to know other people's opinions on the theory I've concocted and if they think it'd be cool.",FortNiteBR

But this next season is different. It's premium. Epic expects us to actually pay money for it again. So hopefully we'll get some bang for our buck. 

Maybe it's just a personal preference too but the future sounds like a much more interesting theme for a season than pirates and buried treasure. From what I can tell so far the first two skins in the teasers look cool as well. 

Obviously I'm just speculating. And we really won't know much until thursday when we get to see what's in the battle pass and everything else the season offers (I love the opening cinematics for new seasons)

Guns like the deagle, silent sniper and hunting rifle become loot trash that you only pick up if you can't find a heavy. The heavy doing 150/157 body shot is just too powerful when a majority of the game you are at 150 total health. My proposal would be to limit the damage of the heavy sniper to 110/125, still making it the most powerful sniper but also not one shotting any random person that gets shot by it.

This would also cause people to start contemplating picking up a silent sniper (because it's silent), a deagle (hits harder but requires accuracy to use), a heavy sniper (one shots build), and a hunting rifle (faster reload). I think this would be a good balance to the game and makes the other snipers more relevant to different play styles.",FortNiteBR

Epic Games owes you nothing. 

This sub used to be such a great place to come to see funny clips, memes, and wholesome discussions about the game and events going on in game. But ever since Epic started engaging more with this subreddit, players started to become more demanding, knowing that Epic was now within earshot. Fast forward to today, players are demanding changes to the game on a daily basis. Valid criticism definitely exists, but it’s outweighed by the incessant cries for balance changes in a game that was never designed to be competitive in the first place. We need to realize that, assuming all subscribers to this sub are active, this sub accounts for approximately 2% of the continuous player base. Fortnite has around 50 million active players, and to have the audacity to think that we, a small fraction of the community for a free to play game, deserve anything from its developers is ridiculous.",FortNiteBR

I wanted to share you about a situation that I was able to attend via a ""friend ». Being 23 years old, I have a job I play fortnite when coming back from work or during my free-time.

I met a young 16 year old who certainly has a good level but has never pierced ... He is now out of school, no more contact with his friends. He lives only for fortnite and dream of becoming Pro / Streamer or see even earn money through the WC.

I find it so unhealthy that young people ruin their schooling to make money on a game.

I find that Fornite has its share of responsibility because they opened the competition even for those who are 13 years old!

If you are a parents or a minor, try to make them feel that everything is just a game and that there are only 0.001% of the players who make enough money to live on it.

I think that after WC Fortnite should close the competition for minors.

What do you think ? I am not looking for upvote but I hope that some young people can read me and see that it is not only people who succeed but that there are young people who sacrifice their lives for this game ... I think I know what I'm talking about I also played a lot being younger (CoD, GTA, WoW ...) but I always put my studies before video games and now I have a job, I do not miss anything.

It pains me so much to see all these young people fail and be lost in their lives because of a game ...

&amp;#x200B;

For clarity - I like Ballers. They make rotating around the map easier with little risk of taking damage and, if someone did shoot at you and destroys it, they are usually enough distance away so you can make a judgement call on whether to push or flee. No, I don't want them to be vaulted. Yes, I want them removed from competitive game modes. Watching the world cup over the past few weeks, by the 6th circle, it's just a mass hysteria of players in Ballers (reminds me of a malfunctioning pinball machine). If the first evidence of vaulting Drum Guns is that they take no skill to use, how can that even be comparable to a vehicle which provides 100% protection to shots, has 200 HP and is easily maneuverable?

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself to be the definition of an average Fortnite player. I do my weekly challenges with friends, get a couple of wins a season (got my first ever double digit kill win the other day, DUBS!) and I enjoy watching the competitive tournaments on Twitch. I don't want to see 15 people in Ballers by the end of the game waiting for other players to run out of mats/ammo then picking on them like vultures. To me, **that** takes no skill (which is why I do it in Arena *\*sniggers to myself\**).

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the Drum Gun. Yes, it rips into builds more than any other weapon in the game (closest being Minigun excluding explosives). It has the second least single bullet damage of all the ARs and is by far the least accurate. I rarely see a pro player with &lt;200 bullets in any class past the 6th circle. Would a pro player consider taking a drum gun into the final few circles with, lets say, 50 spare medium bullets? Less bullets to use for a silenced SCAR (which is one of the most accurate guns) to pick people out the sky. If a pros answer is yes, then what is your reason and what stops you using a Minigun (genuine question)?

&amp;#x200B;

I actually missed the event because I was on holiday (Fs in the comments plz) but if I did attend, I would have voted Drum Gun. Takes me back to season 4/5 of getting cheap wins of spraying and praying baby. Any pro that would have faced me 1v1 would wipe me out before I even register a shot on target, so I don't know why they're so against it.

&amp;#x200B;

What Epic done with the sword must be remembered. They released a weapon they'd clearly spent a lot of time thinking about, creating, programming, testing, etc. but when they saw the beast they created in a tournament and the destruction it was causing, they duly vaulted it. I've seen loads of posts about having a separate pool pot in competitive and I'd be inclined to agree. I do also agree with what Epic do when they initially release a weapon though and throw it straight into competitive as, in all honesty, that is one of the main reasons Epic has a competitive pot, to advertise new things to get more people to play (and more importantly, pay!). Thoughts welcome on all the above, as usual!

&amp;#x200B;

Off topic - an item i'd like to see introduced is an amendment to the port-a-fort whereby it's basically a metal 1x1 with a roof on top. Imagine carrying them round in max stack of 3 and throwing them at either yourself, a loot crate or another player! Perfect for end-game strategies where a player is trying to escape the storm, you can throw one of these bad boys at them and they'd have to bash or shoot their way out of it as it won't be editable! ***CLIP IT!!!***",FortNiteBR

(or any other platform players that are interested) Do you think it’s kinda cheaty to use motion controls, especially when doing cross platform play with other console players on Xbox or PS4?

I’ve been using them since they were released because switch had no form of deadzone settings available, and it’s insanely hard to aim on the joysticks since they’re so small. So my question is: are motion controls justified if we have 30fps, no deadzone and tiny thumb sticks? Or do we have an aim advantage that other console players don’t and is it unfair in your opinion? 

I’d love to know your thoughts on this! This isn’t really a serious topic, but one I thought would be interesting considering that motion controls are the closest thing on a console to a PC mouse in terms of movement.",FortNiteBR

This post is going to be a general discussion, so anyone feel free to replay to this post, comment, or reply to other comments!

Hi there! I have recently been having anger issues more frequently from this game since about 2 weeks ago. Players are beating me because they’re better than I am, but despite me reeling myself they’re better and I won’t remember it on 5 mins, I get really frustrated.

I don’t send hate messages or anything because I know that’s immature (coming from the one who yells at Fortnite, i know lol), but I just let a better player who killed me get the best of me.

My game sense is horrible and I can’t keep consistency with my aim, builds, or anything else really. As a result, I get angry at myself for not doing good, and I get even more angry after dying in a game.

Any help or tips that you guys might use to stay calm?

Thanks",FortNiteBR

The cut scene will show one final rock being launched form the volcano, hitting the vault in lootlake causing the nexus to become unstable, and explode. The events of this will cause us to be  teleported to the future. Tilted will be repaired but the always destroyed building will be once again destroyed, with this retail will also be repaired, the volcano will be a mountain and will no longer hold lava, dusty divot will be full of hard magma rock and all of the snow biome will melt causing that side of the map to be full of water that players can go in. I think it will be set relatively far into the future, so these events can catch up. 
My reasoning for this:
The volcano is still smoking meaning it is still active. Fortnite tweeted ""the future is unknow(n)""
Donald mustard also quoted this tweet with the letter n my theory is that, the next tweet will end with and (o) then (w) and on patch day it will say the future is now, this supports my theory of this season being a future setting.
Donald mustard tweeted back in season 7 posting a video of a rock and man jumping off into some water, he then replied saying this ""this gives me an idea for season 9 (not about the guy jumping) people have shown that the rock kind of resembles polar peak, with polar getting hit and starting to crack, and the lava being so close to the snow biome. It, in theory. should melt and if were going to the future this will speed up the process. Its also important to point out that the whole rock is surrounded by water, this means that greasy witch was currently flooded before it froze over will be once flooded again and maybe inaccessible. 
The volcano becoming a mountain is very common in the real world and travelling to the future again could speed up that process. Dusty divot filling up should likely happen as the lava started to ride once dug up form the dig site, in my theory it will continue to rise and with it being future themed, in the future it will harden. And turn to solid rock.
Other places will most likely be gone or damaged. I expect this to be the last season for the villain and hero base as they are already, very destroyed. Places like tomatoe temple will fall to rubble and haunted hills doing the same.
With the ice biome melting happy hamlet will be floating in parts (like the cube island) in the water.

That's all I can think of, I kinda just wrote and didn't look back so if theres anything mistakes then just reply. Thanks for reading",FortNiteBR

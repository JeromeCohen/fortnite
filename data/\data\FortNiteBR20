Tfue is creating his own brand/org and he has recruited other streamers to join. Cloak will move in and they will start the brand, Tfue definitely has enough money and clout to pay for this org and find endorsements/sponsorships.

74,Yultzy,1558505267,brl4ps,33,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/brl4ps/i_think_we_can_all_agree/,0,I think we can all agree,"There are a handful of things in this game that need to either be nerfed or vaulted. And these certain items include:
#Boom Bow
#Flintknock Pistol
#Ballers
#Tactical Shotgun

Boom bow takes 0 skill. Its long range, across map, 100 damage for not even hitting a person takes absolutely no skill whatsoever. A casual player can silently shoot me with an explosive tip arrow from across the map for nearly my entire health (if i'm 200 hp). The bow needs to do 100 damage IF YOU HIT THE PERSON, not shoot the floor next to them. The bow either needs to be vaulted or nerfed severely. This weapon takes 0 to no skill to use whatsoever. In my opinion, this weapon needs to hit the vault and never come back. Its the most OP, broken weapon in this game.

The flint knock pistol. I say this weapon needs to be vaulted or nerfed because I literally just got flint knocked to the face for 180 damage. There is in no way in hell a pistol should do that damage considering the kid got a ""lucky RNG"" shot. I'm sorry. But no. The pistol should NOT do more damage then a shotgun.

Ballers. We can all agree that the game felt and was WAY more fun when we didn't have to worry about these balls swinging around the entire map and third partying our fights. Competitive Fortnite became that much more competitive and it actually showed who had skill and good rotations to zones rather then sitting in balls until they were forced out by boogie bombs or a player shooting them. Not to mention, there's a glitch that happened to my buddy where he simply can not get out of the baller no matter what (that is unless someone blows it up). Ballers are buggy, no good for the game, and simply need to be vaulted.

I put the tactical shotgun in this list because my god, ever since they made the combat shotgun more consistent with it's damage, it's sniping range, and the fire rate of the shotgun, the tactical shotgun just simply does not compete anymore. It feels so freaking slow now, it does potato damage, and it has NO range on it whatsoever. So if you don't have a combat shotgun, you will more times then not, lose that fight. Tactical shotguns literally serve NO purpose in this game anymore since the combat is by far superior. This gun either needs to be BUFFED or vaulted as well. There has to be a downside to one gun (combat shotgun) where the other (tactical shotgun) succeeds and at this point, NOTHING makes the tactical a better shotgun.",FortNiteBR

I kept playing regardless. Obtaining the rewards were good. Nothing better than reaching tier 73 for a burger emoticon. Or the ember spray, I mean what more would I want?

Well. The fortbytes were the last straw. You need to go all around the map collecting those fortbytes for a secret skin that you don‚Äôt even know would look good. From Junk Junction to Fatal Fields.

They are both in on it. Massive viral apology videos with click bait thumbnails.. This is so obvious. 100% guarantee this works out in a positive light for both parties.¬† Leave the hate now but remember this post when the smoke clears and use your brain. Pretty easy to see when you take a step back. Easy money. Faze Banks claims he was totally blind sided by these actions yet it states right in the ""legal document"" that Tfue first pushed for this and officially notified them in 2018. Link below to that screenshot also. This was removed from the fortnitecompetitive sub which is ridic. If 800 people can make posts about about who's side their on and why, this should be allowed.

10 days after some James Charles apology video gets 54 million views on YouTube...after Banks did a makeup video with James Charles in March..super obvious. It will work too which is nuts. There will be a happy ending and they will make an insane amount of money from this.

 Lmao it gets better. Literally the day before this Tfue drama happens Banks dropped a YouTube video titled ""Tati made $19.6 MILLION DOLLARS off James Charles beef"" in which he discusses pretty much exactly how doing what I'm claiming would work out and how profitable online beef can be.¬† You can't make this shit up. Link below.

Here's another fun fact. If you try to comment anything regarding a publicity stunt or both of them being in on this on the actual Dear Tfue video, it will successfully post and you will be able to see it while logged in on your account but it will be flagged and hidden when logged in on anyone else's account or not logged in at all. Someone went out of their way to set keywords to be marked as spam if they try to call it a stunt or say they are both in on it. You are free to leave as many ""keep your head up Banks"" comments or spam ""click my profile picture for a big surprise"" 100 times though even if it's from a brand new Google account with no history or content. Feel free to try it.

Use your heads and don't feed in so easily.  I can tell you that I'm suing my brother, upload a picture of some unconfirmed document, and then have my brother make some heartbroken sad video shortly after. Does that mean its a real situation or law suit? You don't know these people. Follow the money.

Fortnite is a free to play game, but it heavily markets the cosmetics as a buisness model.
Fortbytes lock certain cosmetics behind a very grind heavy wall.

Now (this is not a certain thing) but many people who have the time to grind it out do not have a job, while people who wont be able to grind it out might have a job.

Which means people who have the money to invest in the game are not going to be happy being locked behind a grind wall.

And making paying customers unhappy is kinda not good for a business model which relies on those paying customers since it is a free to play game.

If at the end of the season they put 1 fortbyte unlock for lets say 200 V-bucks (similar to battle pass levels). I think that will be much more profitable for them.",FortNiteBR

Just a few games ago, I ran into 6 people (3 separately, 2 instances of third partying) and I bailed out instead of fighting. Honestly? It makes WAY more sense to run and jump into cannons/slip streams than it does to fight at this point. 

No siphon coupled with the higher rate of third partying this season and tbh, I think 95% of the community would benefit from playing passively and running away instead of engaging into battles that you can‚Äôt win. I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I shoot somebody and they instantly build a 10x10 base and I immediately think ‚Äúnope, not going to die to that‚Äù and run like hell. Good thing about this season is, you can actually get away with it at this point, too. 

I‚Äôve played a good 50% of my games this season where I die to somebody and leave them hanging with 10hp or less and I‚Äôm sick of raging because somebody got lucky and hit one more shot due to bloom so now I‚Äôm going to hang back and relax, and let y‚Äôall kill each other, you don‚Äôt get any type of reward for kills so why even bother? Lol. 

Even if you do 199 damage to somebody, operate under the assumption that they will one shot you, you will miss all of your shots, or that they‚Äôre an elite level streamer. Trust me, EVERYONE is going to be better than you, no matter how good you are lol. 

My suggestion is, land at the corner of the map and camp until end game, the first 30 seconds of any match consists of soccer sweats chasing you around the map with gray pistols so sneak your way into the top, get max mats, carry some gliders and just get high ground. Somebody pushes? You run. It‚Äôs a strategy that works WAY better than going for kills, trust me.",FortNiteBR

Like now it seems if you deal early damage, it is way easier to hold W on that person knowing that if you have 200 HP it is impossible for them to one tap you (short of a sniper headshot)

So doesn't it not only encourage W keying on new players who have low hp, it also takes away literally the only chance that player has to get ""lucky"" and hit a 200 damage pump?

Doesn't this conflict with Epic's attempts to make the game easier for newer and less skilled players? Also wouldn't that account for the high % kills with pump? Like I know for a fact you got one tapped once or twice by a significantly less skilled player and were shocked about it.

Just a thought, what do yall think?",FortNiteBR

In creative I would average about 40 fps, but in normal pubs and arena I would average 20-30 frames, on 50% graphics. It gets worse in close range combat and arena too, where frames will drop into the low tens. As unfortunate as it is, im getting used to it and mostly playing creative.

&amp;#x200B;

I am in need to solve a problem, and who else to ask better than you.

So, my teen son plays Fortnite and really loves the game.

So do also all his classmates and friends and they play online.

&amp;#x200B;

He recently asked to have a gaming headset so he can chat with them, and I (really not so well financially) got him an ADX Firestorm A01 gaming-headset for his Nintendo Switch.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem is that his mic doesn't seem to work with Nintendo (it works with anything else), so I Googled it and it appears that there's an issue with Switch-Fortnite-Mic compatibility.

So far none of the YouTube videos have helped (his Audio settings are set on ""on"").

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know how to solve this? It is not a real world problem, but I do wanna see my kid happy and have no more money to buy another set.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

just some thoughts on the current weapon set I found interesting. From what it looks like to me, the weapon set is getting pretty close to a balanced loadout with multiple ways to achieve the desired playstyle (close **vs** medium **vs** ranged). I found the fact I could grab multiple types of weapons from each group and end up with my desired type of load out to be very interesting. I agree they still need some way of helping to combat the ""spray meta"", but something simple such as a buff to farming rate may do just that. My point in all this, is aside from other issues this may be one of the most balanced weapon sets we have seen.

I think it would be nice if it sort of tied in all the previous seasons as well, because IIRC, season 10 is apparently the last season they have the story line written up to. I was thinking players could have two options, there will be a season 10 battle pass available to all players and there will be an option for players to earn any battle pass for seasons they may have missed. Players that bought every battle pass get the season 10 battle pass for free, players who want to get the season 10 or a previous season's battle pass will pay the normal $10 price. They can only choose one previous battle pass, though.",FortNiteBR

* Wick's Bounty makes you feel like you need to take up many precious inventory slots with healing items
   * After getting attacked by the same squad 3 times they will drain your health and healing items this allows squads that come in after the fighting can steamroll you
      * Siphon could fix this
* Wick's bounty rewards an unfun play style and punishes aggression and eliminations
   * When every new encounter forces you to kill 12 people in quick succession Your materials are bound to take a beating
   * There is no time to farm for materials in a game mode that ends in the 3rd or 4th circle
   * Players that wait until the end of the game to engage with enemies come in with full materials
      * The 150 materials on kill and 40% increase to materials would get rid of the material problem while a 500 material cap would keep people from wasting 5 minutes in a build battle for 4 coins
* Being in first placed anywhere other than at the victory royale screen is heavily punished
   * When you're in first you location shows up on the map and compass, heavily incentivising players to attack you, and when a full squad can attack you 3 times and several squads bum rush your health and shields are decimated for the nice reward of being 1/10 of the way closer to victory
* I think arena settings would've greatly improved the overall enjoyment from this LTM

In a game mode where you spawn with guns and the main objective is to get as many kills as possible I would assume settings that causes ""to much aggression"" would've been implemented",FortNiteBR

It might be possible that the Old School emote is referencing a change in the future for Season 9 or 10. It could be referring to to the return of the classic Fortnite we all know and love, possibly in the coming seasons. This is easily recognized because of... well... the name ""Old School"". 

If you look at other games such as Call of Duty, you'll realize that once the game goes to the future, there is no where to go except the past. ( Infinite Warfare \[2016\] - WW2 \[2017\])  This means that the only place Fortnite is able to move on to is the former version of the game, and this is because we don't know whats in the far future, and the whole 'future' thing might negatively affect the game as it did with some of the Call of Duty games. 

Anyway, my point is is that Fortnite has hit a dead end story-line wise, and the only place to go is where it all started.

To make the gun more balanced, they could make the drum mag tommy gun epic and legendary whereas the blue and green is a short mag with a capacity of 20 or 25 depending on the decision. This could balance the gun yet it still being a good gun. Drum guns may have the same damage and not changing to higher standards.I would appreciate this and have a great time!ü§óü§ó",FortNiteBR

Tfue is sueing because FaZe won't let him make his own brand deals. The entire lawsuit is based on the potential money he could have made. When he first joined FaZe he was a tiny streamer and having an org that gets brand deals for you would be great. but as he grew he ""outgrew"" FaZe and wanted to find his own deals, ex. Ninja with Redbull. I think the way Banks is dealing with the whole situation is making this way worse than it should be. the highsky thing is the only thing they should be worried about. all the smaller streamers in FaZe still have really good contracts and have been vocal about this. For example, Dubbs and Megga who tweeted abt this. This is like a child moving out of the house when they turn 18. Tfue was raised by FaZe but now wants to move on and do bigger things.

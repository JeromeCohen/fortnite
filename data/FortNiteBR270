I think Epic has catered to noobs a little too much. Obviously you want your game to bring in and retain new players, but not at a massive cost to veteran players. Something that was iconic to me about Fortnite that differentiated it from every other game, was the ability to build. I love building battles. But now, I feel like the game is getting away from that. I loved getting in a battle where both players are building everywhere and trying to land that fatal shot with the shotguns. But now, those battles are few and far, and often ruined. All it takes is one player with a drum gun, lmg, or minigun and my building is all gone in a split second. Epic keeps nerfing the shotguns for doing too much damage too quick, yet they add in the drum gun, which annihilates you in close quarters. So now, Epic has made it so double shotgun combos are completely broken.  To combat this, everyone and their mom is running around with guns with high DPS and high ROF, and every time I build, my building just gets destroyed. I haven't even mentioned explosives. I built a base that consisted of 3 1x1 built 3 blocks high that were all connected. That thing got obliterated by rocket spam in a split sec. Adding a limit on how many rockets you can carry is great, but for an actually effective nerf, its time to increase the reload time. Their damage radius is just insane. ARs do sooo much damage to building as well. It is now also much harder to push on people bc all it takes is one C4, or someone whipping out one of 5 high ROF guns with op damage and your building is all gone. Buildings are getting destroyed way too quickly. I feel like the game has turned into people running around spamming high ROF guns and less of people getting into good building battles. It just feels like Fortnite is turning into something else. I understand Epic wants to stray away from the ""just build lol"" meta, but this isn't the answer. If I wanted to play a game where i get melted by high ROF guns in .08 secs 24/7, I'd play COD lol. So my question is, what do you guys think about the rate at which building is destroyed and the abundance of people just spamming high ROF guns now and just the overall gameplay/mechanics of the game?

TL;DR

I think the game is broken bc:
-Over abundance of high ROF/DPS guns that plow through building and health 
-Shotguns are BROKEN, pumps are not even worth picking up anymore, and that was before they made it so double shotgun combos are unusable (Epic logic: hey to make our game better lets lower the damage so that our primary  close quarter weapons don't kill as quickly! hmm so we should add the drumgun that just melts kids closequarters)
-Guns/Explosives are doing too much damage too quickly to building
-People not even attempting to engage in building battles anymore and merely shooting down all building forcing players to spam build to protect themselves, not a major issue except when you have MINIGUN-unlimited ammo LMG-100 rnds DRUMGUN-50 rnds, there is little you can do when someone has one of these weapons combined with a good position in the circle

I'll be accused of merely being a hater for this post, but that isn't my goal. There are things that Epic is doing that i like, but the overall changes they've made have made Fortnite much less enjoyable for me. It is extremely frustrating to play now, as it feels like every game ends with me just getting spammed with the drumgun or another gun to the point where every build I place is destroyed almost instantly and I can barely survive. 

Do you guys agree? Give me your thoughts and lets try to keep this positive. ",FortNiteBR

Everyone is acting like Epic telling us to use different guns in an insult. They’re trying to keep the game from becoming too monotonous, as well as making sure not to exclude the casual player, as well as new players. If these types of players don’t stand a chance against someone with more experience than them, and get obliterated in the first 5 seconds of every gunfight, then how are they meant to improve?
        I’ve never, in all my time playing Fortnite since October 2017, killed someone by using the double shotgun method. I got upset when I got killed by it, so I chose not to use it out of respect for my opponents. And looking back, I’m glad I never hopped on the bandwagon in the first place, because if I did, I would be upset about the recent nerf as well. I will even go as far as to deliberately throw games over double shotgunning my opponent, just because I know how it feels to die from it. When did people stop caring about how they acted to other people online?
         Double shotgunning has little to no counters, and to properly counter someone using 2 shotguns, you either have to be extremely skilled at the game, sneak up on them, or use 2 shotguns yourself to kill them. This is why double shotgunning is overpowered, as it’s only counters are skill and fighting fire with fire.
           It’s actually kind of disgusting to see people looking for new exploits as soon as old ones get patched. So far in season 5, I’ve seen countless YouTube videos on new exploits to replace double shotguns, such as shotgun-smg and shotgun-lmg. Can’t you just play the game how it’s meant to be played without giving yourself some sort of unfair advantage?
            So that’s my opinion. I have a bit more to say but I’ll stop for now. I’m preparing to lose all of my karma from all the downvotes I’ll be getting, but I just had to share this, and hopefully there is at least one other person who shares the same opinion as me. Feel free to continue the discussion the the comments.

Not my kid, but my brother. he's 10 years old and never had a console or PC. About a month ago I let him play on my PC with a controller. he loved it. I let him play the LTMs because he was on my account, gotta keep my grind. After seeing him play he kept talking about it. Now he lives with our mother, so I only see him 2 days a week. But I thought that deserved much more. Me and my dad talked and we split the cost of an Xbox one, so he can play on a console while I play with my PC. He loves to have my dad watch him play, even if he isn't the greatest.

About 2 weeks ago he got his first solo win. Before me. He was so hyped and I was super excited to see him win a game. especially because he beat me to a solo win. He won by camping the game away, and he saw the last 2 people having a build battle on a mountain, so he saw the one die and he took out his scoped AR and hit the last guy with one headshot. Luckiest shot I have ever seen. he was and still is talking non stop about it all. We have 3 duo wins together, and he played with random squads, coming across a squad all wearing black knight skins. He thought they were so cool.

Well he made it pretty far but got cornered by 2 enemies, and the black knights couldn't save him fast enough. They carried him to a win. Thanks Black Knights, he's even more estatic that he won with people who have skins that are ""cool and rare."" It really makes my day seeing him get excited over the simple things too. Season 5 was just icing on the cake for him, and he is so hyped to play with me this week with the new golf carts.

I'm thinking about buying him the battle pass before he gets here, to make it a grand suprise. Thanks everyone for being a great community when you play with randoms, it really means the world to my brother.",FortNiteBR

"" Hello,

Thanks for contacting Epic Games Player Support. 

You have been observed using Cheats to gain an advantage against other players in Fortnite. One of our primary goals here at Epic is to foster a healthy and cooperative community for Fortnite. For this reason, this type of behavior is not tolerated.

Due to the nature of your infraction, A permanent ban has been placed on your Epic Account.

Any External Accounts connected to the now banned Epic Account will not be removed. This means you will not be able to connect your External Account with any other Epic Accounts.""  


at this point, that injector is the first thing that came to my mind, I tried to explain what happened and they just quoted their previous reply, I  asked for the time and and more info on the ""cheats"" thingy, hoping I can prove that fortnite never ran after downloading the injector, and that this auto ban is false, they replied: 

"" Bans for any reason are not issued unless they are rightfully warranted. For this reason your ban will not be overturned.

Due to internal security policy (and the protection of our software) we cannot disclose the methods that are used to identify any infraction.""

***I)  Explosives ?*** Its ***explosives,*** not a fucking fillip onto your build lmao.   


\- Former **C4** for example was freaking useless, destroys** 1 or **2 walls and sometime its** didn't even destro**y a wall properly, while the enemy instant rebuilds what you destroyed like you did nothing.   
   

\- To destroy a fucking 1x1 tower you had to put **3-4** C4s to destroy it in one go, to backstab a team in a base you had to carry** 1**0 C4s at least, it was freaking annoying and felt useless. It was the same for the** Rp**g and any other, you destroy 1 or 2 walls, the enemy instant rebuild, you rocket someone, he put a wall,** one god damn wal**l, and he doesn't get damages. That wasn't logical at all.   


  \-  Some people says ""yea but thats not fair, how do we counter it anymore its a one side fight"", well, **adapt** ?  I mean, at the beginning of the game people didn't know how to build properly, then when good people started to emerge with builds fight, at least everybody started to feel the power of the building, even new player now build even if they don't really understand the game yet. People started to learn double ramp rush etc.** They adapted themselves**.  Now in order to adapt to the new meta just learn how to counter it, figure it out, like people who figured how to double ramp to counter 1x1 campers, like how people figured how to put wall behind these ramps in order to avoid people to make them fall.   


**&gt;&gt;&gt;** Just start ***thinking*** instead of just complaining and expecting Epic to remove the changes just because you don't try to understand the changes and find a way to counter it. **&lt;&lt;&lt;**

You know thats pretty dumb because when people started to figure how to build kinda properly, like in nov/dec/jan, a lot of the player base unable to build as good as the other were complaining and asking Epic to remove the building mechanic in the game. And now what ? All these people are crying because now they can't counter explosives.   


***II) Double shotguns nerf ?***  


So there's the double shotguns nerf now, eh.  When i **saw** many posts with OPs saying ***""i can't play anymore****""* and stuff i can't contain myself from laughing at them. Seriously ? You only play with one weapon in this game ?   
  
They finaly fixed shotguns pelets, after 3 season of Reddit posts, streamers complains. And i don't see anyone mention that, i only see crybaby unable to shotgun anymore.   


\&gt; ***""Explosives are op uinnnn""***  but when your double pump switch was faster than your Tac, there was no problem for you at all right ?  
\&gt; ***""Explosives are one side battle uinnn""*** but when you used your double pump on people you didn't train,  didn't know or just couldn't do it there were no problem, uh ?  
\&gt; ***""There were no problem because it increase skillcap""*** Sorry but, how is it skilled to switch a weapon to another, i just had to play few games to do it, how is it skilled ? 

   How is it even fair when you got killed in 1s by a double pump, while your opponent could only shot once and had their 0.5s reload? (How was it fair to get one tap at 200hp)  


What do you guys want seriously,  you want every players to get better until they can't and end of the game ? They reach their limit and then, nothing ? Every changes increase the longevity of the game, increase possibility and doesn't limit only to their limit, because it increase the ways to fight and to react. It avoid players who really like the game and plays since a long time to get bored.  Its attract new players too.  


\&gt; Just one personnal example, i used to play a lot of CS:GO, and i still love this game, however, when you play as much as you play fortnite now, the game feel repetitive and sometime you're like ""ohh i wanna play a game"" and once you finished you're like ""oh yea that was good but i'm gonna play something else now"". Its this way for me because i played so much that now i make an indigestion after a game. I give a personnal example because there's probably other people the same as me. &lt;  


The game get so much fun, i remember that every update where they add thing such as weapon, shopping cart, map changes, city, weekly update, the comet, the rocket lauch, now gold cart and now those temporal fault, i feel amazed that this is the very first game online that is really that fun. They keep amazing me, and you guys should too, instead of taking things like double pump as granted because it was included in the game thought a glitch, or because the c4 destroy you 1x1 tower.  


  
This is maybe a personal idea, but i feel like these changes help your more than you might think. -&gt;   
Why ? Because in a way or another, you have to quick think when you're in trouble in game, you must think to solution, you have to look your surrounding and use it. You have to be ***smarter*** not jut good because you can double pump***.*** It increases your capacity to adapt, your capacity to think, in game or in real life.   
Did you ever play LoL, or CS:Go, and think about a team mate as ""Why can't he thinks ?"" like ""He doesn't have to be good, he just had to ***think***"".    So i let you think about my statement.  


***III) New comestic changes.***  


Lol those thinking about that are just selfish retard, nothing more to say. Imagine you had to unlock the full BlackKnight armor, then the shield and stuff ? The John Wick suit ? You freaking paid for the Battle pass, you should be able to unlock everything as long as you play, if you got Tier 100, you played a long time already, so why should you be limited in season to get the full cosmetic ? You already got the skin.  


This wasn't even a problem before season 4 because for example John Wick challenge were good and fair, you plays, you're rewarded. You don't just grind level with an horrible xp system. Its more like they were lazy to make real chall in s4 ahaha.  


\&gt;&gt; ***""Its not fair for those who put more time than the other""*** lol, look, you got the skin earlier than other, such as s2 ou s3 when you saw black knight or john wick in lobby and got scared IG, what do you want more ? Do you think your skin will upgrade your personal life ? lmaoo  


\&gt;&gt; ***""It decrease skin rarity blablabla""***   ????? Wth you talking about, you own the skin already, why should the upgrade be locked to season ?   


Like i said, if you really want a """"""""""""***""prestige***"""""""""""""""" for the grinder, put a level 100 unique skin and thats all. Battle pass is Battle pass.  


I can't stand how people are selfish and they want to be special because of cosmetic, in game. Stop thinking about your own ass and be more civilised god damn.  


  
Just to be clear, i'm not mad at guys complaining or angry or anything, idgaf about them srsly. But i'm fed up going to Reddit and see 10 post a day about pump, c4, cosmetic . Can't you enjoy the new stuff ? Stop getting stuck to the past and grow up.

I know Rook is an Asian character model, but I figured with a season involving so many Viking skins, Epic could have diversified their non-Nordic skins, including that USSOCOM looking dude, as Season 4 already had a pair of white character models sporting the military/tactical appearance.

I was watching Fortnite clips with my little sister because she likes to watch them and a clip of Avxry was playing. He was trying so hard to beat someone in a 1v1 and lost. Fair enough, right? Nope. He was ANGRY. He just started trying to roast the person who killed him out of anger saying “look at you with your 1 kill” (it was right at the start of the game and Avxry himself only had 1 kill). The person then died and you can guess his reaction already.

It was when he got back to the lobby that I cringed. He started roasting his viewers at this point. But it was his level. This was 1 DAY after the start of the season and he was LEVEL 46. You know how it is when it comes to levelling and the time it takes. He was level 46 after a day. Trying to roast players and now his viewers. It was at this point I thought. No. I don’t want this. Sitting doing literally nothing but playing and turning into the prick that Avxry is.

I propose a golf-style “cut” that occurs after the 2nd and 5th circle. For example, if there are more than 50 people left after the 2nd circle (in solos) then the people in the lobby with the fewest amount of kills would be at risk of being “cut” from the game and sent back to the lobby. This would incentivize kills early on in the game. This “cut” would only occur if there were 50 or more people left in the lobby. A similar cut could occur after the 5th circle if there are more than 25 people left in the lobby. As long as there is a healthy amount of killing taking place, no players will need to worry about being “cut”.   


Imagine a Thanos voice 60 seconds before the 2nd circle closes, “ I AM DISPLEASED WITH YOUR BLOOD LUST, I REQUIRE MORE SACRIFICE” the voice booms out. Once enough players have been killed the voice says “I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR EFFORT... FOR NOW”. If enough killing does not take place, Thanos (or a character like him)  would SNAP his fingers and the stragglers in the game would be sent back to the lobby.   


I think this change for a competitive version of Fortnite would not only reduce server stress, but would also make the game move at a better pace by incentivizing kills. The logistics of when the cut would occur, and how it would be decided can all be up for debate ( I do not know what the exact sweet spot would be).   


Let me know what you all think of this solution!  


TLDR: Introduce a golf style “cut” into competitive Fortnite.

At least buff the tactical shotgun again since you cannot use it with a pump anymore without it taking a second to get out. The tac shotgun is my only option now and I can hardly use that since close range fights I'm getting 32 headshots and 40 headshots again and again.

You seem to be nerfing things that don’t need to be nerfed and buffing things that don’t need to be buffed. The current fortnite’s combat, while improved, doesn’t have the joys that once used to be there. 

You nerfed the llama materials which was uncalled for. Everyone loved llamas as there were only 3 in a game and they filled up your materials but the nerf to 200 materials was horrible almost as if you wanted to destroy the game

You buffed the smg which was uncalled for. The rare (blue) silenced smg is now the most overpowered gun in the game with people preferring it to scars. The smg now lasers from distances, given that you have a good aim, and it almost seems unstoppable if shot from behind a few metres away if your sensitivity isn’t high enough on PS4 or XBOX. 

You removed the ability to use two shotguns from your loadout with the new delay. Sure, the original idea of a pump and a tactical shotgun was not to be used together but people done so and people loved it. The double pump had already been nerfed with the pump delay and all you needed to do was nerf the double heavy a bit. Now I only carry a pump smg or a tac. 

The explosives in the game are horrible and overpowered. It was a great move to reduce the rocket ammo cap but that doesn’t mean you need to buff the aoe to structures destroying the majority of a one by one with one rocket compared with the old one rocket destroys one wall if hit directly at it.

The amount of bugs in the game is overwhelming. It seems while we wish for you to fix bugs you interpret it as add a new item. The amount of weapons already make so many variations of the ideal arsenal but you need to stop from the updates and fix a lot of bugs, maybe in minor updates to stop huge maintenances.

This game has no skill gap anymore, since the only features added in Season 4 and that continue into season 5 are things for the kids that have no skill and just sit and spam.

There are so many ""spam"" weapons now for people to use instead of actually doing something skillful. Can't build? Why don't I just sit there and spray a thompson or minigun or smg or LMG or C4.

**C4**: No place for it in this game in my opinion. Should just be vaulted or removed completely. I get it's use, but it's just stupid that it creates a big smoke screen and people get 4 immediately and it isn't even rare so it's not hard to get 10 of them. 70 damage is perfect, but with the radius on structures and the fact that you get so much of it, it's just overpowered. You can't counter it with building because they just keep throwing it and it breaks 5x as many walls as you can place before they throw another. Everything in this game except C4 can be countered with building. Tell me I'm wrong.

**SMG**: Or mainly the thompson. Yes this is a great weapon, but this and all the other SMG's now do too much damage. I love that they were buffed so there's more gameplay than just shotguns, but I feel like the damage could be dropped a tiny bit. It's very difficult to beat someone that has a thompson if you have a shotgun. Without repeatedly building (while it just shreds through that for an unknown reason) you are screwed. It's a laser. I love the Tac SMG and Supressed (and the thompson too either way) but I highly believe they need to be nerfed. I'd say fire rate is fine, but if anything the damage needs to be lowered.",FortNiteBR

I propose a golf-style “cut” that occurs after the 2nd and 5th circle. For example, if there are more than 50 people left after the 2nd circle (in solos) then the people in the lobby with the fewest amount of kills would be at risk of being “cut” from the game and sent back to the lobby. This would incentivize kills early on in the game. This “cut” would only occur if there were 50 or more people left in the lobby. A similar cut could occur after the 5th circle if there are more than 25 people left in the lobby. As long as there is a healthy amount of killing taking place, no players will need to worry about being “cut”. 

Imagine a Thanos voice 60 seconds before the 2nd circle closes, “ I AM DISPLEASED WITH YOUR BLOOD LUST, I REQUIRE MORE SACRIFICE” the voice booms out. Once enough players have been killed the voice says “I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR EFFORT... FOR NOW”. If enough killing does not take place, Thanos (or a character like him)  would SNAP his fingers and the stragglers in the game would be sent back to the lobby. 

I think this change for a competitive version of Fortnite would not only reduce server stress, but would also make the game move at a better pace by incentivizing kills. The logistics of when the cut would occur, and how it would be decided can all be up for debate ( I do not know what the exact sweet spot would be). 

Let me know what you all think of this solution!

TLDR: Introduce a golf style “cut” into competitive Fortnite.

Of course  they will stay the same price as they would with v bucks. What makes me think this will happen is that when buying the season 2 battle pass, there is a text saying that “future season will be real money store purchases.” But this never happened since it still costs 950 v bucks. If people are just able to farm v bucks from save the world to purchase items in battle royale, epic will lose a lot of money. But I play save the world myself and farming v bucks can be very hard since you can only do a certain amount of missions a day that give v bucks. But maybe epic has a business plan to profit from this. I just don’t know. So this is my theory and please don’t take this as an official thing.",FortNiteBR

It showed... kills need to be incentivized. Anyone that's looked into or read the logistics of what you guys are doing in the back end (especially with the extremely intricate moves you made to 50v50 to get precisely the effect that you desired out of 'regular' players with the storm changes you've made). We get it -- 70+ people are not suppose to make it to the 2nd circle and third storms, and there shouldn't be 30+ people in the last few storms. It's no good for servers, it's no good for entertainment to have rubber bands. So here's what you do:

Battle Royale Competitive tourney's should be 100% kill-based. I'm saying -- reward early game kills, gunning it, landing on top of someone and shotgunning them in the face and having to scrounge for health pots or have viewers on the edge of their seats wondering if Myth is one hit away from being down for the round. It makes for brilliant entertainment, it's why we watch streamers like Ninja and Myth and Nick and others, because of these come from behind victories.

Hear me out though, here's what I mean by 100% kill based. I call it a Kill Count round. You can call it something else if you want. Here's what I mean: if we're doing a duos tournament, and let's say Myth and Hamlinz are gunning it and get 15 kills in a round and get downed, and let's say it gets to the point that 15 kills in the round is no longer possible, the storm closes in on everyone, and the round is awarded to Myth and Hamlinz based on their Kill Count for the round.

You can do this for any amount of rounds, 3, 5, 7, cumulatively, whatever you want, however you want to do it. The format works for any amount of rounds of Kill Count.

Tie-breaker are no problem.
Oh, you have a question about what if there is a tie after a Kill Count round or after all Kill Count rounds? Well, that's when you have the remaining/or top fighters fighters duke it out in a winner-takes-round or winner-takes-round you legitimate Blitz Battle Royale.

Yes, Blitz is back. Why? Because it works for this intimate setting. With less players, your server issues are practically a non-issue. Even with a squads competitive setting, if you had a 5 round tournament and 1 team each won one round of Kill Count, you'd have 20 people total. Even at 10 rounds, it'd be 40… and they'd all be dropping close to or where the storm will start, leaving them just enough time for resource hunting or scoping out a team on the edge trying to get into a camping position. Again, this makes for BRILLIANT entertainment value, as can have your spectator mode following the intimate action of the final rounds, or even in the intimate action of a tie-breaker round of Blitz. 

Think of it like this:

Let's say I get 13 kills and get headshotted by Ninja noscoping me from 300m. I still have a chance to ride out that round and win it, and the leaderboard could be updating in real-time and spectator mode could be following that action as it plays out. Even if you had a solos competitive round end in a tie between three players, this Blitz tie-breaker would be fun to watch, even if it was a 1v1v1. You could follow all three players at the same time.

There's another competitive sport like that -- baseball. I've watch games where the Braves can destroy a team, 12-1. But then again, I've seen teams come back and tie or surpass that lead and those are exciting games.

Oh, and there's another competitive sport like that -- golf. I've watched tournaments where Tiger or someone else was ahead 6 strokes and done with his 18 holes. And I've also seen total nobodies come from behind and take the cup from him on the VERY last hole. (Imagine a Victory Royale with your last kill to take the lead in round is also the victory Royale in a match!)

And there are even more sports that do things that I have discussed, as well as the above two sports -- tennis, hockey, football, soccer, and more all have tie breaker scenarios that are RIVETING to watch. Edge. of. your. Seat. excitement!

So basically, this would result in the exact opposite of what you saw today. You'd have duals that you could follow immediately with the top players duking it off. You'd have so much killing you'd have trouble following all the action, but the best part is that you would having gripping action no matter where you looked. You could start following the early leaders and see if they could keep up their Kill Count.

If there's something wrong with thus format -- tell me. I honestly think this is the future of this esport, for solos AND teams. We already see things like it in Friday Fortnite, although not handled so gracefully through the official UI, and also, it's a completely random group of people, so you could end up in a lobby of potato's. I think my solution ends all those problems.

You'd have pros playing pros. You'd have build off digts for kills. You'd have pros killing pros. You'd have intimate rounds. You'd have tiebreakers. You'd have a sport.

I'm fine if they decide to go with a derby style of scoring like a NASCAR style thing, but that honestly still at the end of the day rewards camping and staying alive as long as possible, and that doesn't fix the server capacity problem. This does.

Would love to hear feedback on this system from others. Today was painful to watch. Let's make this something all of us can watch. 

P.S. And also, Epic, if you could -- please just pay Lupo the big bucks to be a permanent fixture of Fortnite MC'ing. The dude is a pro and his voice is like butter. I don't like hearing people that don't know the game and aren't enthusiastic the way Lupo is. These guys tonight knew nothing about the players, the metagame, the weapons, and just kept laughing off all the problems uncomfortably.

Sorry for the long read. I just wanted to make sure my idea was clear. From a logistics standpoint, I don't see it being much different to manipulate in the architecture of a regular Battle Royale. I hope Epic and you guys agree.",FortNiteBR

My reasoning...

I understand epic wanted to avoid camping in the final circle, but I personally enjoyed the intensity of seeing who would make move first.  I thought it was fun to wait and see where the final circles would be (since they were so important if you were established.  Before the ending was tactical, now its just a mess.  Did anyone see how many died to the storm in the Saturday Skirmish?  All those players lost the chance to win by outplaying others because the storm forced movements that are difficult when you have that many skilled players in one area.  

My suggestion...

Even if they don't scrap the idea and reset it (which I doubt will happen), I think it would be a MASSIVE improvement to simply slow the speed down of the circle.  If you want to keep the central closing circle, in my opinion, it should be slow enough for people to not be pressed for a mad dash to the center.

Yeah so this new season has came up and I was really excited and hyped about it. I wasn't able to play early day 1, as I was working all day, but at the end of the day I hopped on, and was playing and started to have fun, even got a nice squad win and duo win. Then, just past 10 pm, when I was playing, I would get into fights with people that seemed to be like pro level good. First of all literally everyone is using this new ""Drift"" skin, which I guess doesn't bother me that much. But what really bothered me was the skill of these players. I got off in a rage that night because of how crazy way too good these players were and then decided to try again the next day, hoping maybe it was a fluke. So, next day rolls around, I get to play some bit, and it was back to basically how it was before, with a few insane players here and there. However, 10 pm rolls around again, and, as you can tell as it is 11:10 pm right now, the insane sweats hop on ready to build gallons. My team would barely be able to kill everyone in an engagement with these crazy people, then two more squads would come around the corner out of no where, and annihilate us. So my question to the community is, WHERE the heck did all these players come from? Did this new season hype revive the dead of every single ninja clone with battle pass starter skins? What happened to my games being difficult fights but not too chaotic? I'd like you guys to also share similar experiences if you have any. Personally, I think of myself as a pretty decent player, enough skill to build pretty good, and pretty good aim most of the time. So I'm just bewildered by these lunatic builders who are literally blasting hundreds of mats in instants and get on high ground instantaneously sometimes. I'd like an explanation too!

I never used or even attached the engine to fortnite. I have shadowplay proof of me not cheating.

Make sure you both have big team replays on in the settings. One person will be the ""seeker"" and the other will be the one claiming the llama.

The seeker will jump from the bus as soon as he can. As soon as he jumps, he will leave the match. He then can go into replay mode and pause the replay once his character jumps from the bus. Then go into free drone cam and turn the drone speed all the way up. Quickly scan the map for the llama.

Meanwhile, the person claiming the llama will still be in the live game spending as much time in the air as possible while waiting for the llamas location from his teammate.

I know it's a bit cheaty, but I didn't want to spend tons of time looking for a llama. A friend and I both completed our llama challenges in 3 games. My friend found the llama too late in one of the games. I hope this helps out some people.

After wearing them for a while, I found that gunshot sounds seemed incredibly loud, and actually hurt my ears. I had to turn the volume in Fortnite down to 60. After a few weeks of playing like that, I found that player sounds were very quiet, to a point where I could not hear people's movements effectively at all, and gunshot sounds were still at the brink of being painful. I decided to do a test using my headphones. I tested the decibels coming out of them using various guns, and found that at max volume the guns were shooting at around 100 db. For those of you who don't know what this means, 100 decibels can cause permanent hearing damage after just 15 minutes.

I understand that this is where epic makes their money... but does anyone else agree that epic needs to step up their game on the WOW factor of legendary skins? 

Most other items labeled “legendary” in the game have some sort of “awe”. There hasn’t ever been a legendary pick axe or emote, only 1 glider has ever been released, and weapons are always something to get excited about. 

Skins that are labeled legendary (in my opinion) should offer a loading screen, always have a back bling, and have some sort of “unlock-able” to create depth and return in a game that only offers such in the battle pass.

I'm an average player with a decent amount of wins thanks to being an old dude who recognized my own strengths and weaknesses. I have a blast playing this game but sometimes it's easy to get drawn into the complaints about the game or find myself overanalyzing shit instead of having a good time. 

Today I let my six year old son play the game on my PS4 for his first time ever. He's played other games on Xbox at his friends but he's only played a game or two of Fortnite at a birthday party. Despite that he knows a ton about it from talking with his buddies. Anyway, I set him up with his own account today and let him go at it and he had so much fun. It really brought the game back into perspective for me.  

Here are some highlights: 

* He refuses to do anything before he gets into the circle. He would barely pick up any weapons and when I told him to use his shields he said, ""but daddy I'm not even in the circle yet!"" He wouldn't even harvest materials. 

* Finding chests is *awesome*. He was able to build a ramp and get a chest out of the roof of a barn and he said, ""hey, I'm getting pretty good at this."" 

* Everyone who has a skin must be a Youtuber. 

* Teammates who steal his chests aren't jerks, ""it's OK, he can have it, he's probably nice."" 

* When he's in the circle he starts looking for people to give his stuff to. The first time he saw a full Omega he said ""oooooh, I bet he's really good, I'll give him this shotgun."" He gave the Omega a purple heavy and was OVER THE MOON excited when the Omega waved to him. 

* He got one kill on someone equally as bad as him. He used Clingers to kill a guy in a house in Pleasant Park. I think the other guy was struggling to try and pick up a shotgun. Getting that kill is all he talked about tonight before bed.

* His very first game he managed to stay alive and get a win in 50v50. He spent most of that game hiding in the trees in  and hunting mushrooms in Dusty Divot and he got super lucky that the circle closed in on him.

* Once in the final circle he was in a port-a-fort and got ramped rushed, built in, destroyed, and then danced on. His response, ""That. Was. Savage!""

Watching him play really gave me a new perspective on the game. It made me smile to see him having so much fun doing mundane stuff and not caring at all if he didn't get X amount of kills or into the top 10 or whatever.  

Just something to keep in mind the next time you embarrass some poor no-skin and call them trash. It might be someone like my son who is certainly having just as much fun as you. ",FortNiteBR
280,TheMrMattie,1531620008,8yydbt,33,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8yydbt/season_5_killed_fortnitebr/,0,Season 5 Killed FortniteBR,"I don't care how many people are gonna tell me wrong, or ""just build lol"" but I'm telling you Season 5 mechanics are horrible. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the new map. I think it is one of the best changes ever, but, I hate the new meta. Shotguns just  don't work anymore, everytime you use them they do less than 30 damage per shot. Even with a direct headshot with a pump. Shotguns just don't work, and even when they do they have the cooldown. I can't tell you how many fights I've lost because of this mechanic and the fact that shotguns do no damage. The new meta is all smgs and drum guns which are horrible because they rip through structures. With the little amount of materials you get and the amount of damage all of these weapons do, building is just not an option. Which sucks because building is the only reason I got into the game. I love the competition of the building but when building isn't an option it becomes luck and no skill. You might just say, ""hey, just get better aim,"" but the problem with that is even with a direct heavy shotgun shot to the chest you might do 13 damage and they might hit you in the foot with a shotgun and do 93 damage. Another big problem I have is the amount of people camping in a 1 by 1 on top of a mountain. With the new meta, people can camp on a mountain with snipers and miniguns. When you try to get close to them, they just rip down the building. It's horrible and that's why I recently suggested that the storm moves downwards toward the end. It would make the campers move to the bottom on a fair playing field. I think this season might be the downfall of Fortnite because they're changing their game based on the unskilled. They should focus more on skill aspects of the game. Now I'm not talking about pros, like Ninja or Myth, I'm talking about average builders who have fun skillful fights. I think that Epic should repeal the shotgun mechanics and revert it back to a better time. ",FortNiteBR

I got all the other Weekly challenges done pretty quickly. Only one remained: Search a Supply Llama. So I've spent *MANY HOURS* searching and driving around the map, looking for a llama. Then one game in solo, I decided to land at the racetrack in the desert. I landed on top of a building, and got a launchpad. I was about to get a car, but then saw someone driving on the track towards me, and I got in the car (he even stopped for me. Remember, this is Solo) and then as we were driving around on the track, I saw it. A llama. Just sitting there. On the side of the racetrack. It was on just sitting on the side of one of the outer walls. I immediately jumped out of cart, and ran towards it. It was to far up on the wall for me to reach, and I had no materials. I went and broke enough of the tires to build to stairs, but when I built them I realized I was still not high enough. I went back to break more tires, but when I turned around I saw the second stair was gone. I don't know what happened to it, maybe someone shot it or something. Then I remembered my launchpad. So I placed a floor, then the launchpad, and landed on top of the wall. I went over, and started opening the llama. I got hit by a shotgun blast, I think from down from the track, but it wasn't to bad. At this point, I was REALLY freaking out, hoping no one kills me *""I don't care if I die as long as I open the llama!! Just wait 6 seconds!!""*. I hear the sound of someone going through a rift, and gliding down towards me. *""Almost done, come onnn 2 seconds""* I hear the sound of him landing. I am 95% done opening it. But IMMEDIATELY after landing, he shot me with a shotgun, and I died. I cannot even put into words how mad I ~~was~~ am.

The Roadtrip mystery item skin is Thor. On the teaser it looks like it is a skin with a cap on, thats just his long hair.

Also hints on suitcase with spraypainted the name: Thor.

Reason for my theory: Thor Vs Ragnarok.

Thor is imprisoned on the planet Sakaar, and must race against time to return to Asgard and stop Ragnarok, the destruction of his world, at the hands of the powerful and ruthless villain Hela.

Hela also is: goddess of death is based on the Norsegoddess,Hel. Explains why Viking themed skins gets involved.

So just like season 4 we had two superheroes against eachother, Now it is Thor Vs Ragnarok.

Recently, like hundreds of thousands of Fortnite players, I watched the new Summer Skirmish event hosted by Epic Games.  The tournament was advertised to be an epic mashup between some of the top personalities of Fortnite but unfortunately, it was a mess.  While many would attribute the failure of Week 1's Summer Skirmish to the unbearable lag, I believe that the entire tournament was doomed from the start.  I could complain about the flawed scoring system that purely incentives winning and speak about how it should encourage aggressive play and getting kills, but that's not the only problem with this layout.  When putting this many high skilled players in the same lobby, it becomes very difficult for gamers to actually play their style.  Even the best players are forced to tunnel and hide their way to a top placing.  This got me thinking, what if an additional mechanic was added to encourage movement to prevent these types of games from becoming a stallfest.  

**In order to offer a more varied and entertaining competitive match, a new mechanic know as Deterioration should be introduced.  Built structures (wood, brick, steel) will begin to take damage after a certain amount of time has passed until it is fully destroyed.  The time it takes for bases fall apart depends on the material.**

**Wood (200 health):**  Deterioration for wood starts after 30 seconds and takes 10 damage a second until it is destroyed after 20 seconds.  (So a wood structure would be completely destroyed 50 seconds after placing it).
**Stone (300 health):**  Deterioration for stone starts after 60 seconds and takes 10 damage a second for 30 seconds.  (A stone structure would be completely destroyed 90 seconds after placing it).
**Steel (400 health):**  Deterioration for steel starts after 90 seconds and takes 10 damage a second for 40 seconds.  (A steel structure would be completely destroyed 130 seconds after placing it).

**Now, how exactly would this mechanic benefit the competive scene?**  
-At the very least, it will eliminate excess builds over time to decrease the amount of frame drops and lag.  
-It will promote fast pace, skilled gameplay and make it more difficult to continously turtle in your own base.
-It will incentivize farming stone and steel and using more than just wood in fights.
-It will introduce a new element of awareness by making players pay attention to the amount of time they stay elevated in a build fight.  Players would still have plenty of time to get in massive build fights (especially if they utilize materials other than wood), but if the battles prolongues, players would have to drop down and reset the fight in an attempt to avoid taking fall damage as a result of the bases being deteriorated. 
-If players choose to take a more passive route and camp inside bases, they would have utilize the repair feature to fix their bases and reset the deterioration timer. 

**In short, building deterioration will allow for Fortnite to maintain the most appealing elements of its core gameplay while also increasing the spectators' viewing experience.**   

**P.S: While I think this mechanic would be great for competitive, one of the attracting points of Fortnite for casual players is the entire base building appeal. This leads me to think that this new mechanic could tested in an LTM mode and then be implemented into these high skill tournament but maybe not into the core battle royal.**

3 days ago I logged into Fortnite and noticed my skins and keybindings had been changed. This immediately raised red flags, so I changed my password, returned my settings to normal, and went on with my day. 

Later that day, My friend sent me the attached screenshot. You can see the Cyrillic letters below my name (MiH Ryan.) I was obviously perturbed, as I thought I had done my best at further-invasion proofing. I enabled 2-factor authentication, changed back my skins and keybindings, and again went on with my day. 

Now, when I logged on yesterday, I noticed that the **Rainbow Smash** pickaxe and **Zany** emote were in my locker. i didn't purchase them. I checked my bank account, and *my* card hadn't been charged. I'm guessing my Russian friend paid for them himself. (Should Epic see this, I didn't pay for those items, feel free to take them back.)

So far, I have not been blocked from playing, and I have not suffered financially. This does not mean, however, that I don't care about this guy. **Does anyone have any tips on keeping him out of my account?**

**I** ***have not*** **given my password out to any third-party sights except for logging into Storm Shield One and Fortnite Tracker to check out my stats. Not accusing them of this privacy invasion, but just throwing it out there.**

**I** ***have*** **contacted Epic Customer Support.** With all due respect to Epic, their automated ""tips and tricks"" responses have not been of much aid.

It is not diverse at all and only has different weapons in your slot but everyone’s loadout is around the same slot 1 Ar,slot 2 shotgun,slot 3 smg tommy gun or rocket launcher , slot 4 sniper , slot 5 healing or shield of you don’t run that then you are not playing to try and win. Double shot guns I do agree was op in the aspect of the heavy and the original double pump when you could nearly shoot rapid fire, but now you don’t have a chance to regain control when you have that horrible luck and get that 15 headshot from 5 meters you have no chance to when it simply comes down to rng. It’s as if they took away your choice and basically set the loadout. Now build fights last much longer to where I have see remnants of fights that go up about 40 mats high then they get tired and jump pad out or bounce pad out and just give up on it. It makes the game come down to more of positioning then skill cause everyone has at least 2 weapons that can spray down your builds while they have the high ground so you are simply just stuck below running through mats. Those who think double pump was super op obviously either died to it or couldn’t do it simple facts. Cause for you to say it’s op when the shotguns hit for 17 or so more often than not and swapping to another one is more op than shooting them for that good hit with the shotgun and then spraying them down with a gun that does around 200 damage per second and there is now swap delay is less op then you are an imbecile. This is just forcing us to use something to make it known it is an option it’s always been an option but now it’s the only option. Bring back double shotguns and restore the balance. Shotguns in every other game are the best up close simply cause how it works and is designed in real life so to make it logistical in games it’s meant to mimic that but now it’s down to rng and more times than not is worse.

I don't think so. IMHO this item is extremely situative and can't fit in any situation, it's not even worth a slot unlike all the other healing items. So what Epic should really do about this? Well, there were a lot of suggested changes and mine is kinda similar to one of them. Before that, i want give credits to the one whose name i forgot. He suggested that slurp will work as universal regenerative item: you have 60 hp, and after drinking this potion, you'll have full hp and +10 armor. Also I want epic to make this as permanent buff. What do i mean? Well for example you found one of these slurps while having a full hp and shields and some minies in your slot, what is the usefulness of that? Right, nothing. What i'd want to do is make slurp juice regenerate hp and armor after infinite amount of time since drinking it. Like, you drunk it while being full and it will slowly regenerate 13 hp after you took some fall damage. After that you'll still have 37 points of regeneration, so after taking a shot from scar, you will slowly spend 35 points. Also, it should be stackable up to 2 slurp buffs, so that you can slowly regenerate 100 hitpoints after taking any kind of damage without filling a slot. So many of you might think this is quite OP, but i want to remind you that the slurp is regenerating 1/1 armor and hp per second, so with these two reworks i stated before, to recover your full shields, you will spend 100 seconds and that is decent amount of time. Also, it'll save some unlucky players who've landed on the opposite place from storm-circle if they found one or two of these.

Feel free to criticize and upvote if you like that change, i hope my thoughts will reach Epic and they'll do something with slurp or its rarity.

I love this game and enjoy spending my money and time playing it on my PS4. What I don't love however, is the fact that players on console who stay true to the origins of a console and play with a controller are now being invaded by those who are playing with mouse and keyboard. Time and time again it has been shown what people playing on mouse and keyboard can do instead of those on a console, and now that many have realized that you can play with keyboard and mouse on a console, many are switching and ruining the game for those that either don't have the option, or don't want to switch to try and even stand a chance. I know that many people would just tell those like me who complain to ""just switch"" but I feel like I shouldn't have to change my entire play style and controls just to try and stand a chance in the game. No matter how hard I try, I find that around 2:10 times I can win a fight against a keyboard player instead. I know that the option was added to allow cross play with players on PC, and I fully support that option, when playing with a friend on PC. Then I could care less if I get eliminated by a player who could build and aim better because of their hardware. But when playing by myself or with others on a console, I find it highly overpowered when I run into someone who is such a try-hard that they play with mouse and keyboard on console just to try and win at this game.",FortNiteBR

They tried to set incentive for kills with the reward for being the duo with the highest kill count each game, but this is obviously not enough.

What if they would shift away from rewarding the placement and reward the kills instead? Duo with the most kills wins. Maybe give the team that gets the victory royale a few bonus points to their kill score. People want to see action and by seeing how every streamer usually plays they would probably enjoy that, too.

Please help...,"Firstly, I know exactly how this sounds, and I know how many people are going to respond/react to this post. I am going to be accused of being banned for cheating in the game and nothing I say or do will change that because cheaters lie. However, I am asking for you to hear me out, please.

Going way back, I used to not play the game that much, then all of my friends started playing and I gave it another chance and I started to have a lot of fun playing with them, and even playing completely alone, I am sure everyone here gets that. Anyways, yesterday (7/13), I was playing GTA with a mod menu. The way mod menus work on GTA is you have to have the game running then you inject a DLL into the game using a program and you're good to go, obviously I am not going to disclose any application names or files. Then, my friends got on and we all decided to play a few games of Fortnite together, so I closed GTA and started Fortnite, we all got into the pre-game lobby and I realized I forgot to close the DLL injector for GTA, so I closed it and didn't think much of it. So the game starts and as we are dropping I get kicked from the game saying I was kicked for using a VPN, Proxy service, Internet Lag, or for cheating. I assumed it was random internet lag and restarted my game and was able to jump right back into a game and was able to play for the rest of the day just fine. That brings us to today (7/14), I got on this morning and started playing with some friends, we were able to play two games just fine, and near the end of the third game I was kicked from the game saying that my account was logged in from somewhere else. So I immediately went to change my password to make sure my account wasn't compromised, but I couldn't login and it said my account was inactive.

After researching for hours to see if my account was hijacked or what, I came to the conclusion that I was banned and the GTA mods were the only thing that makes any sense to cause a ban. I know cheating is wrong, I really do, and if I was banned on GTA I would be perfectly understanding, hell I even understand how I could be banned on a completely separate game, because it would look like I was cheating, but the fact is, I wasn't. I just want to be able to play Fortnite with my friends and grind for Battle Pass rewards just like everyone else.

So that leads to why I made this post, why should any of you care? Well, I am all out of ideas. I have emailed Epic Games, but a lot of people are claiming that they are getting no response from Epic after being banned. I have emailed Easy Cheat, and I am currently waiting for a response, hopefully. I was hoping someone else could point me in the right direction. I guess the only thing left for me to do is to drive to Epic Games HQ since I live less than 30 minutes from them. (/s) Also, if there is any Epic Members that can even try to help, that would be absolutely amazing.

When the season 5 update came along, Epic added an ""auto fire"" option to the three shooting options you can choose from on mobile. The issue is that they basically added in an aimbot to their own game. This is extremely frustrating for the players that have been grinding for months to become skilled, and now players can stand still and laser others with no effort. We already have a heavy aim assist so why add an aimbot? On top of this, Epic even recommends the auto-fire option upon starting up the game.

I expect a lot of downvotes but I hope enough of you that see this will understand and help our community gain recognition from Epic.

Shotgun + SMG was already on par with double shotguns (heavy + heavy aside for obvious reasons) after the headshot multiplier and player damage nerf. Then, the subsequent structure damage nerf arguably made shotgun + smg the stronger choice. 

All Epic did was remove a preference choice. I feel no difference in the skill required to use either combo. Still getting the kills with pump + smg by landing those follow up damage at 40 damage per head shot. The only difference was that SMG is a lot more lenient in missing and it shred through buildings.

It would have a 4 rocket capacity. It can shoot all 4 rockets fairly quickly back to back.

How to keep it balanced? 

-Lower damage, maybe only 70 per rocket for the purple version and 75 per rocket for the gold version.

-smaller blast radius, similar to pre buff c4

-long reload time (7.5 seconds to reload)

-cannot move while reloading

I think it’d be a cool weapon to use, it give a strong option to knock down large forts and would have its uses in combat as well.

Thoughts? Ideas on how to improve it?

This made sense because the pump could deal 200+ damage and one-shot a player at this point. After the shotgun nerf, it was probably kept in the game to prevent double pump from being faster. Now, you can't double pump and the pump no longer has the damage to justify its equip delay. The heavy may be a higher rarity, but on top of having almost no delay, it also does way more damage and has a much further effective range than the pump. 

The pump delay simply isn't necessary anymore. It slows down gameplay, feels terrible, and is no longer needed from a balance perspective. It should be brought in line with the shorter delay of the other shotguns two.",FortNiteBR

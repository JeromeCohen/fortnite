I believe so because his mechanics outstanding. Scrims is a big factor of fortnite and I believe he could play and practice more scrims. He has a lot of talent as a comp player also as a entertainer. I feel like he out plays and out smart top names in the fortnite community. I believe Tsm needs to focus more on scrims at some point in there play style or else they will fall behind. Hamlinz mechanics are amazing to watch and I believe he will be one of the best scrim players in the fortnite community. I know there are many factors to consider for the best play on TSM and that’s why I believe Hamlinz is the best overall player on Tsm. Myth has been practicing a lot on scrims but I do not believe he is one of the top scrim players in fortnite. Daequan he is a super good entertainer but he does not play enough scrims as he should be playing. I think the Tsm needs to get more in game synergy up or else they will be slacking behind the other teams next year. Peace",FortniteCompetitive

Pop-up Cups are infrequent at best and half the time they're not even solos, so they play out a lot differently. The custom games being hosted by Epic are regular solos, which have an entirely different ruleset than the tournament. These are not good methods of practice. 

Once again, the tournament is scheduled within a week of a major, meta-defining change, and the players are giving horribly insufficient time to practice. This is terrible for the competitive integrity of the tournament *and* for an entertaining viewing experience. Epic has not given themselves enough time to determine how their update affects the dynamics of competitive. As a result, they've created a meta they've been working hard to destroy for months. I can't wait to watch 15 planes fly in circles in the sky for 10 minutes every game tomorrow.

I love Fortnite, and I think it has some of the most interesting competitive gameplay both strategically and mechanically. That's what people find interesting in professional matches. Epic should be working hard to provide their players with the best competitive experience possible. If they placed more value in making these tournaments as competitive as possible, the viewers would get to see much more engaging gameplay as a result.

I hope Epic starts to make some improvements in this regard. It's unfortunate to see them make the same mistakes they've made in previous tournaments.",FortniteCompetitive

34,2spells2,1544457333,a4wtwn,133,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a4wtwn/planes_are_officially_the_meta/,1,Planes are Officially the Meta.,"After playing the duo cup yesterday, getting to the 30 points threshold and playing sweaty late games against good players, it has become very apparent that planes are just a huge part of the game right now.

Planes are not a quirky gimmick you pop out sometimes like turrets or chillers. No, they are legitimately a way to win competitive games. Let’s set aside their offensive functions for a second and just focus on their rotational advantages:

1. Planes are literally a rift that is slower to trigger but gives you more rotation options, because you’re perpetually in the air until you decide the time is right to glide.

2. Your punishment for flying around too long is that you get shot down, deploy your glider and get to make at least a half decent rotation.

3. Because you’re in a state of perpetual high altitude rotation, you don’t need to build at all while you’re flying. All those suckers rotating down on the ground, getting storm held and wasting mats, ha! Let’s just fly around and shoot them from the sky!

4. You’re not any more vulnerable flying around in a plane than you are rotating on foot. If someone gets the jump on you in game, they can hit a deagle shot, an AK headshot, any number of devastating opening blows. These things can happen while you’re on a plane yes, but on a plane you at least have the option to just fly/glide away, rather than just build and commit to a fight with dented health.

When playing these cups, it already kind of feels like your best odds of winning are when you have a grappler or rift. Well, if you don’t have those things, I’m here to tell you a plane is your next best bet.

As a result of this, it kills me to see that the game is not nearly as captivating and entertaining as it can be. That being said, comment any suggestions I may have missed or what you think about them.

Custom Matchmaking- many games provide the option to let you create your own private game with your friends. It is about time we can get our own matchmaking keys, or at the VERY LEAST, an update from Epic on why it is not in the game yet. 

Graphics Settings on Console- Many games in the past have pulled this off. Console played are out a severe disadvantage compared to PC because of these graphics settings, input lag, etc. Regardless of if it’s a Sony/Microsoft problem, Epic needs to go to them to work things out (remember the cross-platform problem with Sony). Like custom matchmaking, Epic at least owes the community an explanation as to why this is not in the game.  

Remove turrets, airplanes, ziplines (or at least fix them so it doesn’t take you and drop you when you’re high on a build), six shooter. The try of the weapons are mostly balanced imo. If there are some unbalanced weapons, the answer is not to decrease spawn rate like suggested by some people because it just increases RNG in the game. 

Again suggest anything I may have missed. ",FortniteCompetitive

I have been playing a lot of FNPL league recently and as all of you know League tends to have a lot of people in endgame which affects frames and can get pretty hectic for a console.

Explosives are annoying enough to deal with and it's never clear if you're fully out of the damage radius or not.

Turrents, are still a scape-goat. You have “4” health get on a Turrent and spam the opposer with no consequences since it’s nearly impossible to hit someone on a Turrent.

86,Dictating,1544380911,a4nejx,34,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a4nejx/graphical_settings_on_console/,1,Graphical Settings On Console,"TLDR At The Bottom.

This topic has been talked about and discussed ever since Epic Games announced the E-Sports side of Fortnite, graphical settings on console. We can all agree that performance on the Xbox One and PS4 aren’t the greatest and never will compare to that of a PC’s performance. However, if we are going to combine all platforms together during a competitive tournament, I believe that consoles should have the ability to change the graphic settings to have a more stable performance. Allowing consoles to have this option would only give them a more stable FPS and a more stable performance. If Epic does decide to add these settings, there should only be an option to decrease the graphical settings since the settings that are being used on consoles right now is what Fortnite thinks the PS4 and Xbox One can handle. Now, you may respond by saying “it is not Epic’s choice, it is Sony/MS choice”. This seems to be the main response to when this topic is brung up. From what I’ve read, nobody has ever given actual proof to comply with the response, it is just “known” to be true. So unless someone actually provides written proof saying that is up to Microsoft or Sony to decide the graphical settings, I will always believe that it is Epic’s choice. 

TLDR: Graphical settings for consoles are needed. They will only give them a more stable performance. Unless someone has written proof that Sony/MS control graphical settings for games, I will believe that it is Epic’s choice.",FortniteCompetitive

Runescape died slowly over the course of 6 months. It had amassed one of the largest followings of any game ever. Much like Fortnite. But it started to make changes to the game. Small changes that catered to new players, and alienated older player groups; one by one. 

It seems rather apparent after these last 3 months of watching Epics decision making in both patches and new content, that it STILL would rather cater to an easier to play style. I understand why they’re doing this. Every child on the planet went as a fortnite character for Halloween, I watch south park, so I understand who they’re targeting. Problem however. Those kids did that because that’s what older brother and sister were doing. Kids will ALWAYS look ahead of them socially to find out what’s “cool” and partake in it. If big brother and little sister are laughing and saying fortnite is for kids, well you can probably guess what happens next; Bye bye kids. More and more of my friends have stopped playing fortnite, and many of them have over 5KDA (I ran a competitive site very similar to Summer Skirmish; based on Epics initial statement of supporting creators and other things and a more hands off approach, we thought this would be a great idea, only to be ROYALLY screwed over when epic decided to start it themselves, but that’s a post for another time.) 

Point is that many great players are leaving this game in droves. Nerfing nearly all things that made slaughtering noobs both fun, and *REPEATABLE*. I think the big key being repeatable. Things like having to shoot from your dick, adding monster amounts of explosives, added vehicles that basically no one used but the little children due to there noise level, till they added this plane nonsense. (Which was certainly the camel that broke nearly all my friends backs.) and let’s not even get started on double pump nerds, which made the game feel mechanically fun, or those god damn turrets. 


I’d love to know what you think. I could genuinely hope Epic reverts to an old patch from 2018. Just like how runescape did. Funny enough people play the re-released old version of RS more than the newer ones. Which hopefully seals my point. ",FortniteCompetitive

In its current state their is no penalty for using it to charge people in build battles or the open. 

A lot of the nerfs I’ve seen would render it almost useless, so my ideas would be 

- 50 damage to anybody in the plane when it explodes 

- Make it not be able to crash through builds without boosting, if you try to you and the plane takes a small amount of damage. The plane would now be stuck

- Damage if you fly or boost into the ground. This can’t be to strong as landing shouldn’t be to hard 

- When boosting it should only be able to go through 2 tiles worth of structures. If you time the boost correctly

- Make the glider pull at a level more similar to dropping off the bus then a porta rift


These would still make the plane strong and good for rotating, but would make it far from the indestructible middle it is now

[https://imgur.com/a/u48ONcM](https://imgur.com/a/u48ONcM)

&amp;#x200B;

A few friends and myself ""play-tested"" it for 4-5 hours last night making improvements to it as we went (multiple ways to get up to height, or different positions mostly, sort of like halo). My thoughts are, and I've seen a few pros doing this, FFA Deathmatch Discord allowing for training inside of Fortnite as opposed to a Kovaaks, or an Aim Hero. While those are still going to be helpful, you cannot mimic the exact movement in Fortnite, in any other game. 

After those 4-5 hours last night of playing, I felt significantly more confident in my shot. There's absolutely no building in this, so it is sort of hard to adjust initially, but we didn't have a problem switching back to the real game... that was one of our main concerns. Not only did I improve, but I had a blast. We ran 20 minute games over those 4-5 hours, and time flew by. I honestly didn't think I could have that much fun in an ""arena shooter fortnite"". I don't see this ever replacing the BR aspect in competitive fortnite, but I could certainly see a place for it as a training/warm-up tool.

There's a few aspects to this that don't really work too well right now and it is simply because of how new Creative actually is. Buildings are destructible as the true admin of the map. I was toying around with the idea of multi-boxing last night as the true admin, so that I didn't destroy the course as we played. However, I rarely destroyed buildings throughout each 20 minute session. I'd imagine they will fix that ASAP. Secondly, getting loot in the beginning is a pain in the ass because other plays cannot open chests unless they're an admin, and I don't really want people messing with my map. So, in each game, we'd have to drop chests before the game with someone's requested load out. What we tested last night was, AR, Shotty, SMG, Sniper, and Minis... all of blue rarity. I personally like the AK, but my friend likes the regular AR so we can choose whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

The other big issue with this, is that I cannot save my map right now. So, to be able to play on my map, or someone else's map, that person would have to be online. So, I guess to start, to be able to run consistent FFA's, we'd need to find a few hosts with decent maps.

&amp;#x200B;

These are just my initial thoughts, i'd like to see feedback before I decide to dive into this because as we've seen in the past, some of these discords become REAL MESSY.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think, and if you'd like to test out the map (i need some more thoughts, and advice/improvements on it, you can add me on EPIC at Vikolakis).

It's become my new favorite way of playing BR, and it's obvious with the planes being the center of this season that Epic has a lot of stock in them as well. 

But, they have some kinks to be worked out. I won't say they're the most OP thing ever released, but there is some pretty crucial oversights and balances that need to be done to make these things not hated by everyone who takes the game remotely seriously. Here are my top 3 ways to balance the Stormwing. 

**1: Durability.**

*The problem:*

Current, these things are impervious to Newton's third law. Which I find to be a little ridiculous, as biplanes have always been notable in history as being as durable as paper. Instead these are virtually flying quadcrashers, taking 0 damage when interacting with anything that isn't player caused like bullets or explosions. This allows skilled pilots to ruin build battles and be a gigantic pain in the ass to anyone not flying. 

*The solution:*

Simply put, these *need* to take damage when ramming into anything that isn't air. It shouldn't be a flying tank, it's a biplane. Now if you don't want to be drastic and make it an instant kill if you fly into a cliff or scrape your wing on a tree, I get it. But I think a substantial amount of plane damage needs to occur, my two cents is ~300  damage upon any impact when not boosting. Which leads to the next point. 

**2: Boosting**

*The problem:*

The boosting needs to be tweaked, but in a meaningful way. Right now I find the X-4 going though most buildings even when not boosting (albeit in a glitchy, wtf is going on kinda way) and when boosting allows you to go through anything like butter. I shouldn't be able to ruin entire fights by doing nothing, and that's where the problem lies. 

*The solution:*

Give boosting a significantly longer cooldown but allow the players to boost through buildings like the current system when active. When not active, the X-4 should only do damage to structures if itself is taking significant damage, EA, crashing a plane into a building. Now before anyone says anything, I mean a *significant* cooldown. I'm talking upwards of 45 seconds for 3.5-5 seconds of boost. Pilots would have to carefully time their boost to have any meaningful impact on fights, and players on the ground have plenty of opportunities to escape or find cover while the boost is active. The boost should do around ~50 player damage ONLY if the plane hits a player directly. 

**3: Player damage when plane is destroyed.**

*The problem:*

You know what the issue with this is? There isn't any. When being blown up a plane does no damage to players that are currently inside of it. This makes dogfights meaningless, as the only real thing it accomplishes is eliminating an enemy aircraft, which in and of itself isn't a big deal. Pilots should take damage when being blown up in their aircraft. Pilots in dogfights should be rewarded more impactfully when blowing up an entire enemy aircraft with a squad on board. 

*The solution:* 

Players, including pilot, should take 100 damage when their aircraft is blown up while they're on board. Ejecting from the X-4 when airborne should take ~3 seconds and should be given slow redeploy (like an actual parachute) when ejecting. This is a no brainier. Putting in an exit timer forces pilots to eject before their aircraft is 5 damage away from blowing up and allowing slow redeploy makes pilots easier targets for players on the ground. This creates a balanced system in where a team that was forcibly ejected is wounded and an easier target in the air for ground players. This creates a risk/reward system with the plane where teams losing a dogfight should be encouraged to get closer to the ground in wake of ejecting, and players who don't are punished with a slow decent and easy shooting. 

So that's my balances. As for the actual damage and health numbers themselves, I wouldn't touch them. The X-4 should be a threat in the right hands, and I like where all the numbers sit. This took quite some time to type so please give some feedback and let me know your thoughts on my proposed changes.

&amp;#x200B;

I  think people are taking ""Ranked Mode"" too literally in regards to what us  competitive players want and I'll explain what I mean and why.

​

There shouldn't be any doubt in anyones mind that Fortnite at it's  core is a ""casual"" game. I'm not going to get into the reasons why as I  feel they are super obvious, but I have absolutely no issues with that  as it's what made the game what it is today. I will never complain about  something being added/taken away just because it affects the  competitive side of the game for this reason. It's obvious we are the  minority.

​

Fortnite as an esport wasn't just invented by this Reddit sub one  day. Epic has actively marketed Fortnite esports in countless ways. The  two that have always meant the most to me are the Fortnite Esports  official page on Epic Games ([https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/esports/en-US/home](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/esports/en-US/home))  and their long list of employees specifically Esports oriented who have  fantastic backgrounds in various Esport titles. The ones that come to  mind are arCtyC (Esports Operations Manager) and Sky (Esports Designer)  who both come from the world of Professional Gears of War when it was on  the MLG circuit, but I know there are many others including Loomin  (Esports ???) and Sundown (Esports Coordinator) whose backgrounds I  don't know.

​

Arctyc and Sky were on a Gears team called AmazYn and were extremely  successful largely because they were widely known for putting insane  hours into the game whether that be through Gamebattles matches, Gears  of Wars Ranked play, or scrimming like minding players of similar skill  in custom matches. While this example is specific for them and Gears of  War it is the model that every Esports or Sports player uses when you  talk about competing. If you want to compete you have to be able to put  in the work to get better with the most obvious way to do this being  practice. For some people they might be able to practice 5 hours a week  and be the best, while others might need to practice 20+ hours a week  and that grind is what allows them to be the best.

​

Fortnite as it stands has not supported any  ways for the competitive  community to practice despite actively marketing a Fortnite Esport and  promoting the fact that anyone can compete at the highest level in this  game. Regular matchmaking that isn't skill based just doesn't provide  the practice environment that competitors need to improve. You don't see  Call of Duty players scrimming teams who can't win a map. You don't see  the Lakers playing pick up games with casual basketball players who  just play for the love of basketball. The caliber of players just isn't  the same and even the rule set now doesn't mimic what is used in  competition. The Pop-Up cups have been amazing, but they are throttling  how often you can practice by limiting these practice sessions to  specific days and times that don't work for many people. There was only 1  Practice event scheduled before the Winter Royale where you could  practice the rule set and if you couldn't make those events it was tough  luck for you. It's demoralizing for people who want to put in the work  to be the best they can be. That might be Fortnites goal with Esports  where players with more time can't practice more than everyone else, but  they should go ahead and tell us that so we can adjust accordingly.

​

Whether it be a ranked mode with true rankings,  hidden skill based  matchmaking that mimics the competitive rule set with no rankings,  regular matchmaking that mimics the competitive ruleset, or opening up  custom matches publicly so we can take matters into our own hands like  was done with Gamebattles the competitive community would have the tools  necessary to prepare to play the game to the best of their ability. The  RNG is irrelevant, Battle Royale is irrelevant, Mobile players are  irrelevant. Being able to practice 24/7 has been historically a vital  part of the competitive experience and if Fortnite plans on changing  that to this throttled method they really should go ahead and tell us  that so we can either take it for what it is and adapt, or move on to  another Esports title that follows a more traditional method. Fortnite  is my favorite game, but I would gladly move on to something else if I  know a true practice environment will never exist and continue to play  Fortnite as a casual gamer.

​

Personally I truly believe they are working on something innovative  that will provide the Esports players what they need, but the fact it's  unknown is more and more frustrating every single day with the World Cup  being one day closer every day. They could simply tell us there will be  or won't be a competitive practice environment someday in the future  and it would answer so many questions for players, but for some reason  they refuse to do that.",FortniteCompetitive
206,PapiStalin,1544214631,a43rhd,16,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a43rhd/tips_and_tricks_for_any_want_to_be_ace/,1,Tips and tricks for any want to be ace!,"So chap, you’ve decided to hop in that fighter you’ve found and take to the heavens. Good on you sport! But before you do so here are a few tips and ticks on everything from winning every dog fight to knocking out those peevish baddies on the ground.

*They’re standing right behind me, aren’t they?*
Every pilot has at least once found themselves in the cross sites of some other fighter looking to turn there precious bird to shreds! Fear not sport, for I’ve got just the tonic for your troubles. It’s important to remember that our screens are more horizontal then vertical. Your goal should be to get off the enemies screen and get behind them, to do this  try going straight up for a few seconds then hold down the roll button and head left or right. You’ll get off the screen of the fighter behind you and he will be forced to head up as well. Before he does so you’re already on the far right or left, ready to get behind the sausage!

*Gotta go fast!*
It’s notable to note down that your forward cannons are quite pathetic. Dealing a measly 30 damage they are really only good for turning a enemy fighter to fine Swiss cheese or for dive runs. More on that later though. That being said what does considerably more damage is smashing into the bugger! Not only will this do quite a helping of damage but will also knock back any target of your air borne nudge.  While I wouldn’t recommend this tactic for anyone on the surface (as you’ll most likely miss or bounce off and get in a bizarre position unable to move, giving time for the target to quickly obliterate your paper thin head with a shot gun blast) this tactic is extensively useful on chaps in buildings.

*I am not running away! I am making a tactical retreat*
Despite her looking more beautiful than any women you’ve seen, your plane is fairly weak. With only 800 health, a couple seconds of fire from any automatic weapon will eat away at your health faster then the Kaiser and his strudel! If you find yourself subject to such a terarian onslaught, try and move behind a mountain or dive into a valley. There is nothing cowardly about saving your wings! Additionally don’t forget to fly over to an airbase when health is low. There are several of them throughout the map (picture above) where a fresh plane can usually be found. 

*I fear no man. But a well armed team on a plane, it scares me*
The damage a team can do in the late game on a plane is astronomical. You can rain hellfire upon any one you can spot out. That and if you spot any other winged enemies you can focus fire and knock them out of the sky. You also can bail out of any plane that is destroyed, making it completely hogwash not to be in the sky when only a few enemies remain.

*Every man a hijacker*
It is quite unfathomable why so many lads choose to try and hop onto your plane. I suppose they want the rush of taking down a hostile in a three dimensional plane of combat but still, they usually fail. Be on the lookout for these buggers. A quick roll in any direction usually stops their landing.  If you do find yourself being boarded, don’t fret! Simply swap to a different seat and blast there head off before they can react.

*ENEMY AC-130 ABOVE!!*
Do not forget that your airborne annihilator is quite audible. Players will hear you before they see you so be prepared to make a move to cover at all times, regardless if YOU can see the enemy.

*General dive attack! You are a bold one!*
As I said earlier your guns are fairly pitiful. That being said they are good for one purpose when engaging buggers on the ground. Dive attacks.  To execute one of these effectively you must have the speed of an Italiano when the dinner bell is rung. Get High into the sky and try and pick out a single player with there back turned to you. This also can work on groups but you will receive more fire from them. Quickly roll down towards them and fire away. Once you reach the height your glider would deploy at if you were sky diving, swing back on and roll to a side and out of the way quickly! The trick with this attacking is to hit and run, remember, they do more damage to you then you to them on a one on one fight. Remember you are not a Stuka, your payload  doesn’t explode so line up your shots as much as you can.


And that about covers it! If you have any questions or criticisms please voice them in the comments! I will see all of you future aces in the skies!

I’ve forced myself to build more but I’m still so far behind in terms of building skill, and I certainly can’t make up for it in gun skill. I keep trying, I consciously make myself practice building and shooting in a live environment (meaning I just play solos and consciously remind myself to work on my mechanics as I’m fighting.)

This is extemely obvious at this point, and we don't even need to look at their past behavior to come to this conclusion as every other week they're pulling some wacky and zany stunt to the dismay of comp players.


We aren't going to get a ranked mode because Fortnite core audience is not hardcore players, it's casuals and children. And I genuinely believe that people in this day and age are not looking for a competitive experience, we in this subreddit are an extreme minority representing maybe 5% of Fortnite or less.


Over 66% of Fortnite revenue is generated on MOBILE. Do you think these people care AT ALL about a ranked mode? And, can you imagine the 'toxicity' that would come about from a ranked mode? A lot of people suck at this game and they don't have any intention of trying to get better. It can be fun to play with your group of friends regardless of skill and matchmaking. Ranked would put a lot of mental pressure on these casual/bad players (the core audience) and this would create an unenjoyable experience for them. If people are bad they don't want it shoved in their face with something like a public rank. Even the existence of a ranked mode would make them feel pressure to play it. What if you start getting harassed because you're a ""bronze"" player, or someone who doesn't want to play ranked? Even in a 'hardcore' e-sport like League of Legends, only 30% of the community plays ranked mode.


I want this game to be treated like other esports because the potential it has is insane and the skill cap is high despite it being a battle royale. On top of that it's a fantastic spectator experience if done right, but we need to be realistic. Esports in Fortnite only exist to promote the game, competitive players are a spectacle and the only reason they all don't quit is because the money in this game is ludicrous. Epic has demonstrated time and time again that they do not know how to run competitive events or have the desire to provide competitive players with content they can engage with.",FortniteCompetitive

I don't rush much.  Basically, I try to strategically make it to the end with limited engagement and usually end up with \~3-4 kills by that point. /background

So, here's something I cannot figure out.  Put me in cqb with a shotgun and I will miss over and over and lose to the bunny hop battle.  Give me that very same battle with a silenced pistol and I'll kill more shotgunners than are able to kill me.  My accuracy is incredible and my old-school trigger finger is still pretty damn fast.  I've been ""challenged"" on this statement on a number of occasions and I come out the winner more often than not.

So.....WHY????   It's ridiculous that I can fight with a pistol and can't aim to save my life with a shotgun!  What the hell am I missing or doing wrong?  Or, what's your thoughts on why i can perform so well with a pistol?

And it has everything to do with complete lack of logic tied to the loot system which controls the early game for a huge portion of the playerbase.

1. There's too big difference in value from the items you can get. 
-&gt; Too many bad items for early game interaction.
-&gt; A few items are basically unbeatable.

2. Loot is completely random.
-&gt; You never know if loot spawns/chests appear or not, and most of the time you give up your position before you know if you'll even get anything.

The game should be about the 100 players fighting each other and the best player winning, I'll explain why further down, but early game is too often decided by who has more luck through getting better loot. Unless you're literally one of the best players in the game or making extremely in-depth decisions as to where to land for a ""safe"" start. This is a problem because players don't have to do anything to ""achieve"" strong enough loot to beat someone better. To an extent, even though I dislike it a lot, I do understand why some would prefer a more random loot situation as that in itself means that even though they'll be unlucky most of the time, now and then they'll get something good and can do good because of that.  

The reason why this is a bad thing is because it gives people that are not good at the game a reason to feel that they don't need to get better. It also lowers the results of a player that actually is better because of the numerous situations you can get in where you couldn't really do much. Because you can either get something bad, like a pistol, six shooter, burst, sniper, scoped/thermal, no shield, bandages, ammo, etc., which happens most of the time, or the player(s) you're vs. can get something so obviously broken that you had no chance, like a RPG, QL, blue to gold shotgun, 100 shield and so on.

This is a horrible situation to be in and is bound to fail in the long run because it only takes care of the newer players, who are obviously blown away by all the new stuff they have to get used to and learn before they're even considering to get better at the game. Before they notice that the game actually doesn't support their wish to become better in the primary (normal) mode of play. You could argue that POP-UP Cup fixes this issue, and I'd agree that some important steps has been taken in terms of kill incentives to reward both players that wish to become better and players that already are very good at the game. But POP-UP Cup still doesn't do anything to solve the broken loot system.

A solution I've suggested for a while now is to keep early game about the gray, the green and the blue items and then introducing purple and gold (""power"" items) later on in the game through airdrops(!) and vending machines. This would effectively make the early game decided more so by actual skill then the current situation and later in the game it would make airdrops into a fantastic objective that players actually compete for as it can give them something super valuable like a rocket launcher, GL, QL, grappler, rift-to-go, heavy sniper, SPAS-12, slurp, chug etc. Make sure they're shown on the map and watch magic happen!

This coupled with vaulting certain items that only gives you a disadvantage like the burst and the six shooter would be a huge step towards a much better balanced game overall for both new and experienced players. ",FortniteCompetitive

**What does it take to be the best player?**

That's a question a lot of different people will have different answers to, maybe its how fast you build, how fast you edit, how godly your aim is. But for me the true answer is simple, its your mindset. The mind plays very important roles in every aspect of life, if you're not in the right positive mindset then how will you progress? If you're not thinking you have what it takes to take it to the next level, will you ever get to the next level?  
The simple answer is no. Mind over matter, in EVERY situation is key. You have to believe in yourself, call yourself a god, believe you can do this. This isn't a joke, you're in your current position for a reason. What can you do to change that? Is getting frustrated and letting a game get to you the right way to approach this? Is raging and hitting things your outlet to make you feel better after things don't go the way you thought? If so, your mindset needs a big change.  
It goes deeper than mechanics and skill sets, without your mind in the right place your skills are useless.

**So you're wondering, how do i fix my mindset?**

It will take a lot of time and patience, you can't let things get to you that normally would. You have to change how you react to certain situations, see things out differently than you normally would. Change is good, very good. Realize your mistakes and capitalize on them by realizing they are YOUR mistakes. By all means do not be too hard on yourself, but learn from the experiences you encounter. This  right here, realizing your problems and accepting that and willing to improve is the first step towards the right direction. Good job.

**Whats the next step to the right mindset?**

What has worked for me personally, is the meaning of mindfulness. The mindful way of life is the way to be, this will not only help you feel better as a whole, but it will also greatly improve your performance on and off the game. There are many exercises you can do when you're feeling down or completely raging out of hope of the game. Honestly all it takes is stepping back from your computer for 30mins to an hour to do some exercises. This is perfectly fine to do ( realizing you have a problem and solving it). See above.

**What exercises can help me achieve a greater mindset?**

*Meditation:*  
i know it sounds crazy and kind of cliche, but it helps!! Seriously! You'd be amazed at the results, the hard part is actually sitting down and going through with it, but once you've done it for the first time it gets easier and easier and the results will blow your mind.

*Breathing exercises:*  
 If you're losing control or feeling tilted, step back from your computer and relax. Take a few deep breaths, close your eyes and reset. Its perfectly fine, we are only human after all.

I will post a link of many different exercises i find key and helpful.

**Conclusion:**  
Once you've realized your problem, took the steps in the right direction to solve your problem. Now is the time to work on other aspects of the game, progressing with a clear mind. Your grind will feel much more rewarding, your progression will come at a much faster pace. You will have more patience, you WILL become a better player faster than you usually would. This is your time, this is what you've been working for. You will make it!

My name is **Matt Hwu** and I’m a Doctorate of Physical Therapy (OCS), Strength &amp; Conditioning Specialist working with the Immortals to keep their players healthy and prevent any gaming injuries from occurring **(wrist pain primarily).** I’ve previously worked for CLG and have worked with a couple of their FN players. I also grind alot of FN and scrims ;) ;) 

I wanted to write this in the light of season 7 beginning and likely….  A lot of people grinding for the next season - if we all want to get better and compete in these cups we have to stay healthy. Injuries a bitch to deal with especially if you are a pro and is one of the major reasons why professionals in traditional sports do not reach their full potential (Derrick Rose is a big one). Here is a big overview of how I help the teams here at Immortals and many other pros keep their WRISTS healthy through long grinding sessions (scrim blocks, twitch streams, etc. etc.)

**ADDRESSING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM (CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME)**

I want to start off first my making sure our community truly understands wrist pain. There are truly an abundance of misconceptions when it comes to understanding wrist pain in the community so I want to set it all straight here. 

One of the most common misconceptions about gaming and injuries is that those who have wrist pain are experiencing carpal tunnel syndrome. I want to clarify once and for all that most wrist pain in gaming is muscle and tendon overuse and is EASY to manage - and the treatment should NEVER just be - wear a brace, stop playing as much and take medication. 

There are several reasons why this happens but I think the most important two are..

1. The way search engine optimization works on the internet - wrist pain almost always leads to an article about carpal tunnel syndrome so most people associate it with the condition
2. Misunderstanding from treating physicians - I think the misconception is not only limited to the gaming community - I feel that many doctors who encounter a patient presenting with this type of pain almost automatically assume they are dealing with carpal tunnel syndrome and often do not realize the impact of labeling it in such a way. (Most of the time it leads to the patient or gamer going online to research which will often offer them limited information about how to treat the injury)

And unfortunately i’ve treated several gamers/patients who have been told to just wear a brace, take medication and stop playing as much as treatment. Okay so how should we deal with muscle and tendon injuries then?

Because we are dealing with muscle/tendons, it is all about improving the tissues tolerance to load. I’ve written about this several of times but basically our bodies behave as if they have an overheating meter. The more we repeatedly use our muscles, the more they begin to overheat with overheating representing tissue strain or irritation. Things like posture, proper scheduling, ergonomics, conditioning affect how quickly our tissues overheat. Things like rest, stretching, icing, etc. allow it to cool down more quickly - Here’s the article explaining this concept (http://www.1-hp.org/2017/10/02/what-gamers-need-to-know-about-health-avoid-injuries-by-preventing-overheating/

**HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH WRIST HEALTH**

Now that we have cleared that up - how should we approach wrist health? The most common cause of overuse is one of three things

1. Poor Wrist Position/Posture (starting off neutral) 
2. Poor Wrist Conditioning
3. Playing too much (poor scheduling)

So if we work backwards it means we should…

1. **WRIST POSITION IS KING:** Pay attention to our wrist position for both your mouse and keyboard hand. I worked recently with a pro CSGO player whose starting mouse position was tilted to the right which was the major cause of his pain.  After we corrected this position (expecting time to retrain using his mouse in neutral) his pain reduced significantly. SO PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR POSITION! I have a full guide on my website for those interested (http://www.1-hp.org/2016/10/28/esports-health-it-starts-with-ergonomics-and-posture/)
2. **CONDITIONING YOUR WRISTS**: Ensuring we can tolerate the repeated stress of playing for extended periods of time (scrim blocks, new patch releases, bootcamps, etc. etc.). We have to **EXERCISE** and build up the endurance of our wrist and hand muscles. This means following some of the routines you guys have already posted in this subreddit in addition to some that you guys can find online. Here are some routines I’ve come up with for both prevention and warming up
   1. 9 Minute Prevention routine (to build up tissue tolerance) https://youtu.be/lzjOCYkn8mY
   2. 6 Minute stretching routine (mostly for after games to undo stress of repeated use) [https://youtu.be/PXkSDfgAHGw](https://youtu.be/PXkSDfgAHGw)
   3. Specific Exercise Routine I gave to a pro CS:GO player to address his pain [https://youtu.be/nTc1S0jT\_7I](https://youtu.be/nTc1S0jT_7I) (i also go over some of what I talk about here)
3. **PAY ATTENTION TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN PLAY**:  Like I said before our muscles and tendons have overheating mechanics which means if you play too much or do not pay attention to how many hours you have played consecutively it can lead to tissue breakdown and irritation. The bottom line is.. TAKE BREAKS AND PERFORM THE STRETCHING ROUTINE I listed above!

So what about things like, stretching, bracing, kinesiotaping, icing, heating, massage? These are all really common suggestions from the internet as well. These are all helpful for PAIN MANAGEMENT and address the SOURCE of the pain (tendon/muscle) but it does not change the fact we: 

1. Play with poor wrist position causing muscles to fatigue more easily and lead to breakdown/overuse
2. Do not have the endurance to handle the 6-8 hours of repeated mouse and keyboard use.
3. Play for 10-14 hours every day (an exaggeration, but you can get it)

These again are the MAJOR CAUSES.  And that is what we should address.

**Last thought - ADDRESSING WRIST PAIN  TAKES TIME**

This is the hardest truth for most players to swallow. Many pros and casual gamers may stick with a program for 2-3 weeks, notice only a slight improvement, and then give up. This is one of the largest initial barriers to success. Tissues take time to adapt and develop in strength/endurance. Research shows that it takes roughly 6 weeks for tissues to make a change in strength. This means for the full resolution of a chronic or moderately chronic injury, you need to be consistent with exercises and lifestyle changes for at least six weeks.

That’s not to say that it will take six weeks for you to feel any change. Usually, you’ll notice a difference in 1-2 weeks as you have more efficient activation of your muscles and develop more awareness of your body’s limits. The bottom line is you have to remember to be consistent with your exercises and stay on track with your injury treatment program to stay on the road of recovery.

**Thanks and Bye!**

In some formats, a double aggro play-style would work better than any other. This is just a guide to explain what a supportive role does and if you like it then try it. 


# What is a supportive player?
A supportive player is a player who plays with the mindset “I am here to make X’s job easier”. The X is usually an aggro or a flex, in rare occasions and formats, dual supports can work. The supportive player is typically someone who is very mechanically skilled and understands tempo and target focus extremely well. 


# Why do they need to be skilled if they’re playing support and usually in the back?
Typically the support player needs to be highly skilled mechanically as they’d be going off to find angles either far or close. Even if the angle is for a second, capitalizing on that 1-second window of error by the enemy player could mean the difference in a point or not. The alpha would have to be even more so mechanically skilled than the support in terms of builds.

# What does tempo have to do with this?

Tempo is very crucial in 2v2’s or 2v1’s. The support player needs to be able to understand damage calls, and turn those into actions. For example. If the support player hits someone for 22 white at an angle. That’s a huge advantage. If the aggro player is healing and has someone pressuring him making it impossible to get the heals off. It’s the support players job to then create that opportunity for the aggro. Having constant pressure on 1 enemy is critical for this playstyle to work.

##Creating, preparing, and executing 2v1 plans is the sole goal.

#How can you create these plans?

Some of these plans can entail build battling someone, but not having the goal of killing them, having the goal of helping your teammate who is currently struggling in his fight. 

For example, If I’ve lost height on someone, and my duo is currently winning his fight for height, he can apply pressure onto the guy that I’m on, or completely come over to me and we can 2v1 while his guy is still trying to regain / heal / is split. 

**Capitalizing on splits is insanely valuable** and identifying these things is critical to being successful in this playstyle.

This actually happens quite often in scrims. 1 person gets split due to losing height or taking too much damage, and then before they know it they get 2v1’d or their teammate gets 2v1’d. 

Another example of a support oriented plan is finding angles. Finding angles before you take a fight allows you to transition into a pinch play on someone if they survive the shots. It also allows you to easily get a kill as they won’t be able to block both sides at once and keep track of multiple people. This allows you to start off a fight with a huge health advantage and capitalize on the enemy being low HP. 

## Team shooting is quite a useful tool that doesn’t get used a lot. 

Another example would be using misdirection. 

Misdirection would entail firing from one side as another takes a position. This is quite risky as the person holding ground can get sieged quite easily. There’s also another way to take advantage of misdirection and that’s by capitalizing on third parties. A supportive player will absolutely jump on a third party opportunity depending on how long ago it’s been finished and the point set that they're playing. If you just see a fight end next to you, go now and rush them 2v1 each of them and teamfire. 

A supportive player will mainly focus on identifying potential 2v1 plays, executing them with a variety of plans. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on discord. 2v1’s are exceptionally underrated in this game.



If you have any questions feel free to **leave them below or ask me on Discord**. I will try to get back to as many as I can. Thank you for taking the time to read my guide.

283,Chillibby,1544126757,a3rp3m,36,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a3rp3m/ive_been_having_a_blast_this_morning_with_season/,1,"I've been having a blast this morning with season 7, but I'm pretty sure the new ice biome is awful for competitive play..","I know it's still early and we haven't seen any high level play yet, but man oh man this new biome already seems like it'll be terrible for competitive play. I'll break down my initial thoughts in pros and cons, starting with the good stuff.

1. Happy Hamlet is the dopest spot on the map. Just had to get that out of the way.
2. The individual cabin/lodge like buildings that litter the biome have pretty decent loot/chest concentration. This may provide options for players in solo lobbies looking for lower risk drops. 

So for the pros, that's about it.. Now on to the Cons!

1. One of the biggest issues I'm seeing with the game currently is how void the biome is of any real sources of mats.. Maxing out anything as a duo in that whole area is nearly impossible unless you're left untouched and can freely farm a huge portion of it. Pretty much everywhere else on the map gives players the ability to either max wood, or get a large sum of stone/steel  + a decent wood stack without altering their rotation whatsoever.
2. The actual terrain is awful. Yes that half of the map has always been a mountainous valley but now it all just seems wide open with cliff faces. You either have to take the ziplines which leave you super exposed or run through wide open expanses. I could go on about how this creates bad gameplay in both pubs and scrims, but there's just too much to go over.
3. Pretty much any end-game circles that end up moving through Polar peak will realistically mean death to anyone without some form of movement item.. Not only is it the highest point on the map, but the whole damn thing has the overhung cliff design. You can't fall/floor/fall down it, and building up from under it if the moving circles take you their is not realistic at all (especially in game modes with lower mat caps).
4. The frozen lake turns every end-game that goes on it into a complete shitshow. I gotta say it's kinda fun, but it's going to ruin anyone on the lowground once the circles start moving.
5. This is more of a personal gripe, but the whole place is just.. too white lol. After dropping there a bunch of times my eyes were kinda hurting from being blinded by my monitor.

I'm not really ready to form an opinion on the ziplines yet. I think they're kind of necessary for the ice area considering that whole section of the map is basically loot quick, get whatever mats you can, then rotate ASAP and try to avoid death valleys. On the rest of the map though it could go either way. I guess it's nice for the times that you have a huuuuge first circle rotation, but I worry that they're going to skrew with rotational timings and the strategy which goes into that decision making. Time will tell with those.

tl;dr: Happy hamlet is cool but the whole new biome has terrible mats and terrain so poorly designed that it could literally mean the death of 2/3 of the players alive in the endgame should moving circles go near those spots. Also the plane is aids.",FortniteCompetitive

- maybe even a special camo that you unlock once you've unlocked X amount of individual weapon camos ( like diamond camo in cod)

305,STAY_ROYAL,1544107248,a3oh5e,21,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a3oh5e/ranked_mode_after_the_world_cup/,1,Ranked Mode after the World Cup,"Unfortunately, imo I don’t think there’s going to be a ranked mode until after the World Cup. I believe that though Epic is running tests, they would lose out tremendously by implementing a ranked mode now, instead of after the World Cup. 

Having a ranked mode now, a lot of people will realize they aren’t as good they think they are and Epic would lose that glamour that they have of being in the same lobby with your favorite pros/streamers and having the crazed idea that you can compete with them. I know must of us just want to grind and improve, but the second day of the Winter Royale qualifiers saw competition rise as many casuals knew they didn’t have a chance. 

Epic wants to make it seem as if anyone has a chance at winning, and they keep providing players with less skill that opportunity with weapons that give them a chance. Having a ranked mode after the World Cup will be much better in Epics eyes because they can market the dream of being able to one day win it yourself or be like “” who just won it all against the best of the best. 

The skirmishes are going to lead into the World Cup then after that I believe is when they’ll have a legit focus on pure competitive Fortnite because right now they’re still trying to gather an audience as big as possible. They can use a similar setup to the skirmishes to run pro leagues and tournaments. Now that I think of it, the skirmishes are probably just a test for pro leagues/seasons. Who knows?

Epic still has plenty of bugs from earlier seasons to iron out. There’s no set format or idea of how players will lose points(if they will). There’s just a bigger opportunity for them to release it after the World Cup to really capitalize from a marketing stand point. 

I really hope I’m wrong, but with the Pop up cups now altering days, I think that’ll be our main form of competitive practice for now. 


TL;DR Epic will capitalize much more by having a ranked mode after the World Cup. ",FortniteCompetitive

**Creative mode**: Not much to say here yet other then the fact that I think it's a cool idea but that it should also be possibly to play in the 100 player format. As a more fun experience then the normal mode. My hope is that this would make space for a more serious normal mode because I'm boring af and like the game at a more competitive/tactical level then what we've seen from recent development. This does seem so far not to be the case though.

*""Added some optimizations for when players build structures.""* ??

**X-4 Stormwing**: Initially a big fan of more vehicles so it seems ok. Gotta test this first before there's much to say. There's no numbers on how the machine gun works.

**Balloons**: Should've been vaulted, or atleast made as rare as the bush. My guess is that these are still going to be a solid noob trap.

**Updated crosshair on scoped and thermal**: Should've vaulted one and/or made them not a part of the early game.

**Vaulted items**: Says they don't want to keep certain items to avoid duplicates but decides to keep the Rocket Launcher and the Quad Launcher. Doesn't seem very thought out. I do appreciate the fact that they vaulted the Port-A-Fort, chillers, clingers and DB though. Shockwave grenades should've stayed and grappler should've been vaulted with the turret. Still no bouncers..?

**Pop-up cup**: ANOTHER KILL INCENTIVE!!!!!!! That's awesome.

**Audio**: Well, not much new here (for pc players at least). Unfortunately. Fixed some bad bugs though which is good. There's still several issues not being addressed.

HOWEVER they do compete in basketball games nationwide with things like mcdonalds all american or AAU camps. I feel like Epic could set something like this up pretty easily.

**The Claim** 

In this post he argued that the game has become saturated with subpar item choices and this makes it much less likely to have a fighting chance early game against another player who might have gotten luckier and found much more useful early items (such as a good shotgun or shields).

**The Evidence**

This claim makes a lot of sense. Say four people land in Dusty Divot and see relatively the same number of items as each other before they come in contact and fight. I'm going to make up some numbers, but lets say each person chances of finding good early game loot is 25% in these circumstances. There's a 75% chance you don't have good loot, but since you essentially have 3 opponents the odds of at least one of them finding good early game items are pretty solid. If I'm not mistaken, there's a 57.8% chance one of them will have a good loadout.

&gt; The chance of each opponent failing individually is 75%. But to know the chances of person failing you multiply .75 by 3 and get the odds that all three of them will fail (42.2%). Which means that there's a 57.8% chance one of them didn't fail

Those odds aren't great. There is only a 25% chance of you getting good loot but your opponents have over double the chance at 57.8%. As the number of enemies increase, the chance of one of your opponents getting good loot will increase, but your odds will stay at 25%. 

Assuming all players are on an even playing field (same amount of mats, same general skill level, same amount of natural coverage, ect.) and having good early game loot greatly increases a player's likely hood to win against a player who doesn't (which I personally agree it does), then lose around 50% of your games early automatically just because you got a gray burst and one of your 3 opponents got shields and shotgun. (more specifically, you lose closer to 43.76% early encounters simply because one of your 3 opponents has a good loadout and you don't (you also win 10.5% of your early encounters simply because you have a better loadout))

If you guys had similar loot and all the other factors involved are pretty much even, then you could've had the opportunity to whip out some cool strategy you saw a youtuber pull out or even made up a new strategy on the fly. Thus, giving you the edge and also allowing you to grow as a player.

*Let me quickly tell you what the odds of if there was a 75% chance to find good early game loot.* There's a 75% chance you get good early game loot and a 98.4% chance that one of 4 your opponents will get a good early game loadout. About the same difference in percentage (around 25%), but the amount of games you lose simply because at least one of your opponents has better early game gear is only 25.16%

That seems much more reasonable.

**Conclusion**

Not taking into any other variables and assuming that chances for each player to find good early game gear is 25%, a player is likely to lose nearly 50% of their early interactions due to RNG of items you find. If the chances to find a good early game loadout was closer to 75% for each player, then a player is likely to lose 25.16% of their early interactions due to RNG of items you find. Seems better and more appropriate.

However, none of this data is actually collected and it all is based off of hypotheticals.

**Application**

In order to know how to make it so that a player is 75% likely to get a good loadout, it would need to be measured how many chests and floor spawns a person goes to before engaging in their first fight, then modifying the chances of a good early game weapon and shields so that a person is 75% likely to get one of those things.

**Example**

Say an average person encounters 2 chests and 5 floor spawns before encountering someone else. In order to have a 75% chance to walk away from that with at least one shield item, they must have a 40% chance to find one in a chest and 18% chance to find it on the floor. That means a person would have 64% chance to find a shield in a chest and a 64% chance to find a shield on the floor. It also means that they would have an 86.6% chance to find find a shield on the floor OR in a chest. 

If the same chances are applied to an early game weapon, then the chance of finding both will be 75%.

&gt;My work. You want to find a 75% chance of getting both shields and gun
&gt;
&gt;The chance of finding both a shield and a gun = .75 = (the chance of find a shield)(chance of finding a gun)
&gt;
&gt;.75 = (X)(X)
&gt;
&gt;.75 = X^2
&gt;
&gt;Find the square root of both sides and .866=X
&gt;***
&gt;.866 = the chance of finding a shield
&gt;
&gt;.134 = the chance of not finding a shield
&gt;***
&gt;Now since I only need one shield, it doesn't matter if I get it from a chest or floor. But I made sure that it was equally likely to get one from each chest (I'm not sure how I would do it if they were uneven
&gt;
&gt;.134 = (the chance of not finding a shield in a chest)(the chance of not finding a shield on the floor)
&gt;
&gt;.134 = (Y)(Y)
&gt;
&gt;Find the square root of both sides and .366 = Y = the chance of not finding a shield in a chest
&gt;***
&gt;.366 = (the chance of not finding a shield in chest 1)(the chance of not finding a shield in chest 2)
&gt;
&gt;.366 = (Z)(Z)
&gt;
&gt;Find the square root of both sides and .6 = Z = the chance of not finding a shield in chest 1
&gt;
&gt; .4 = the chance of find a shield in chest 1
&gt;***
&gt;
&gt;.366 also = the chance of not finding a shield on the floor
&gt;
&gt;.366 = (the chance of not finding a shield in floor spot 1)(the chance of not finding a shield in floor spot 2)(the chance of not finding a shield in floor spot 3)(the chance of not finding a shield in floor spot 4)(the chance of not finding a shield in floor spot 5)
&gt;
&gt;.366 = (W)(W)(W)(W)(W)
&gt;
&gt;.366 = W^5
&gt;
&gt;Find the 5^th of each side and W = .82 = the chance of not finding a shield on floor spot 1
&gt;
&gt;Chance of finding a shield on floor spot 1 = .18

For example who has died early game because some one found a rocket launcher off spawn and you didn’t have enough mats. I know I have. Adding rocket launchers to supply drops would also lessen RNG and make the game take more skill because you would most likely have to fight a team for a supply drop allowing the more skilled team to get a chance at getting a rocket launcher.

2) Buff chests and chest spawn rates

I don't see why chests can't just spawn 100% of the time? If it's a performance issue, can we at least just get a 25% boost to chest spawns? 

And while we're at it, can chest spawns have higher drop rates of decent stuff? I'd rather have more chances to use purple/gold weapons and shields tbh.

3) Restore the build health 

Back in the beginning of Season 5, Epic nerfed the starting health of walls. This was a mistake on their part and is what led to spam being the meta. I think that we need to restore build health to pre-season 5 levels in order to finally undo all of the damage Epic has done to their game.

So I watched a bunch of key moments (early game landings, late game rotations, mid-game 2v2s), and tried to learn as much as I could. Below I'm going to list some things I learned that they did a lot. (sorry for how long this post is!)

&amp;#x200B;

**Communication**

* They are an excellent example of great communication, I suggest you watch them first hand to pick up on dozens of good comms they use
* Punisher is always calling out exactly where both enemy players are. If he loses height to one, he ALWAYS says ""he got height"", or on the contrary, if he gets height, he tells Lanjok
* If Punisher is on low ground, he tells Lanjok if Lanjok has height on both players (something that gets me from time to time is I think I have high ground on both, but I really only have high ground on one).
* Precise locations of BOTH players when they first engage, and if they don't see both, they're actively searching and calling out if the other sees them before pushing
* Lots of comms on how secure builds are so if they are weak they can both focus it at the same time
* Almost every time they upgrade their loadout, a call out is made
* Always talking about enemy status, ie: teams fighting, fight is finished, they see me, I'm about to take shots, 3, 2, 1 shoot,  etc.
* If one of them goes down, they're trying to notice things their partner doesn't see. Lanjok literally saves the game while on the sideline one game. Punisher is in the storm, getting ticked for 10 with a 1v1 at the end, and Lanjok reminds him to grapple back in. Punisher immediately grapples in and his opponent dies to storm damage a few seconds later. 
* ""Play zone"" was one of my favorite comms they used. Whenever one was being over aggressive or got too focused, the other would call ""Play Zone"". To me, this is better than ""follow me"" or ""on me"" or even ""rotate"" because it focuses their attention to the zone. They may have been so focused on their opponent that they never looked at the next zone, so I think it's a really good way of refocusing your partner.

**2v2s**

* You inevitably have to win a lot of 2v2s if you want to score high, and they employ a lot of interesting tactics to win almost every 2v2 they take by outsmarting their opponents (or if you're Punisher, by outsniping them like...all the time...)
* Breaking down builds when on the low ground. Lanjok seemed to be the more aggressive fighter of the two, and was very good at getting high ground, but Punisher was ALWAYS looking to break fights down if he was on low ground while Lanjok is fighting up top. This doesn't necessarily mean he's taking down the whole structure, more so, it means he's locating who Lanjok is fighting and shooting his opponent's builds out to make it hard for him to gain height. By doing this, Lanjok almost always secures height and lands easy shots while the opponent is trying to rebuild his floors and ramps. If Punisher is knocking down the whole build, he specifically calls it out, and Lanjok disengages with a double wall ramp.
* They are REALLY good at finding 2v1 opportunities within build fights. This is usually a product of their good communication. If an enemy team is split in different 1x1s while turtling, they'll locate one, and both SMG spam from the top. Usually they'll get a pyramid on top, edit it, and then SMG spam the floor above them.
* When they get 3rd partied, they disengage well, and almost immediately every time. One game they have a team low, and Punisher calls out another team is here. They both edit all the way down to the bottom of their builds, then relocate under the bridge by Tomato and wait it out for a solid 3-4 minutes.

**Early Game**

* They prioritize landing cold and looting up over hot drops. They land Tomato Temple basically every game, where they would split houses/temple or bridge/temple if nobody landed. Surprisingly, it was uncontested Every. Single. Game. (sorry for giving your spot away boys). Honestly, I can't believe it was uncontested every game, there's a ton of loot there, and this was probably a huge reason for their success.
* They obviously scope out as they are landing, but I feel they go a step further than a lot of teams. They don't just look for teams landing with them, but look for all surrounding areas and try to guess where they are landing, and already start discussing possible rotations. If they land Tomato and only see 1 team going towards Risky, they recognize the houses North of them will be unlooted. If multiple teams are going towards Risky, they aren't as likely to rotate North since one team is likely to bail on Risky and go houses late. 
* Utilizing vending machines was a hugely important for them, and they're much more powerful in this game mode with the faster farm rate. I personally will look at vending machines when I spot them nearby, but it is clear they have memorized where every vending machine is on the map, and often go completely out of their way to check if they have potions/grapplers/camp fires in them. For example, I saw a game where they bought two slurps from bridge when they landed Tomato. This came up super clutch late game when they had to make multiple mountain rotations and got lasered while jump padding/rifting. 

**Mid Game**

* Still seeking out vending machines
* If they still need to rotate to zone, they try to avoid fights. One game I saw they were going to loot the south houses at Risky, but Lanjok noticed a team was rotating in from the North, and they immediately disengaged and went South to zone.

**Late Game (General)**

* For early rotations, they locate all players, and try to get tags/snipes in. After some teams have rotated, they shut off sniping angles to teams that have already rotated, and then focus teams rotating late
* They are really good at conserving mats for late game. Something I noticed they did a few times was in the 4th/5th circles, if they were far away from people, they would both literally sit in the same 1x1, and that's all they built. If people were near, then they would build a much larger base. They also generally do not build floors in their 1x1s when they build up, which should be scrim 101.
* When launch-padding/rifting late game, sometimes they'll both land right on top of a player who is split from his teammate and just mouse one them.
* Lots of times they shoot at builds just to weaken them so they can see if players are inside when there's like 10 1x1s end game. Definitely something I don't do enough. 

**Late Game (Rotations)**

* When rotating in late circles, if they are near the next zone, they almost always rotate immediately and build 2-3 stories high in the new zone. They then locate all players rotating, and generally focus one team rotating late, while using walls to shut off sniping angles from the other teams. They very rarely directly engage in a 2v2 in late game circle, and almost always 3rd party already existing fights. 
* Grapple, immediately box up, and relocate all teams for long, congested rotations.
* They really like edge of zone on the 4th zone. Just something I noticed, they're almost always at the very edge here, rather than the center.
* For the really late circles, 6th and higher, they make a strong emphasis on grappling to high ground and keeping it. REALLY STRONG EMPHASIS. They were high ground kings. When they start to get broken down, they're really good about reinforcing builds together, or will grapple to the next 1x1 and continue to maintain high ground.
* For long rotations they stay calm and locate all players, usually rotating late. One game this came up clutch in particular. They had high ground in current zone, but had a super long rotation to next zone. I assumed they would keep high ground and rotate along the side of a cliff. Lanjok really wants to rotate early, but Punisher says hold on, let me see where everyone is at and let's make a plan. Punisher notices only 1 team is low ground to their West, and a bunch of teams are already high ground on the path they were going to take. They end up getting a completely free rotations on what would have been insanely difficult if they chose the more obvious path.
* For long rotations, they often times will try to remain completely unseen. Punisher will tell Lanjok to take no shots and stop building so that they draw absolutely no attention and can make free rotations for large parts of it. They also can use people's launch pads who are nearby and didn't notice them.

**Misc Strats**

* When focusing players late-game, sometimes they will make a double window edit on a wall so they can both shoot from the same 1x1. Something I never really thought about!
* They just about never split after very early game. They're almost always within a 10 second run to the other during mid game

**Deaths/Mistakes**

* One game they see a supply drop west of Diner. They both agree it's too risky to go for because people are going to rotate out of Divot/Diner to that location. Then they see the zone is super far, and they want mobility, so they go backwards for the supply drop. While getting the supply drop, Punisher leaves Lanjok to see if people are pushing from Diner. People come at the most inopportune time, when Punisher has low ground going up a hill, and he is split super far from Lanjok. Punisher gets 2v1ed and thirsted. In this case, they probably should not have gone for supply drop, but also, Punisher shouldn't have split as far as he did while Lanjok got the supply drop. They go on to only get 1 point with a 7th place finish that game.
* Lanjok's  mouse died one game...keep that hardware in check. I'm serious, people lose out on chances for big money due to hardware failure all the time. Punisher went on to clutch this game though, and they scored 7 points.
* One game they have high ground and Lanjok drops down to make an edit play and gets 1 pumped because it was a 1v2 on him. Pretty funny moment, because Punisher says ""do you have push to talk on?"" clearly insinuating Lanjok didn't communicate enough. Lanjok later says he communicated poorly and shouldn't have dropped on them alone. They go on to get 2nd with 4 points that game.
* At some point they box up mid-rotation, and try to pass off some bandages at the same time Punisher hear's a rocket go off. He tries to turn around last minute to turbo build it off, but a duo pulls of a well-execute deagle+rocket combo on them and kill them both.

You have someone 150m out and it’s a hitscan weapon that seems to have the snap to target turned way too high. Also up close with aim assist it seems disproportionately “accurate” compared to any other weapon I can think of.

I’m not asking for it to be useless like it was before, just a middle ground where it seems not as easy to use. I’m wondering what other people’s thoughts are on it in terms of balance. Does it seem *too* good?

Do you feel that you’re gameplay improved drastically and do you recommend this to someone using two paddles?

Secondly I want to make the switch to PC, not because I’m trying to enter the competitive scene but after seeing so many posts and stories of people enjoying the game more and detailing how the game is completely different and better on a PC I am genuinely interested in switching over (still using my controller because I can’t even type without looking at a KB and don’t mind still using one) I don’t know anything about PC building and cost but being as FN is the only game I would be playing on PC is it recommended that I make the switch?

I've made a few posts here and there, and I'd like to expand my thoughts into a full-fledged post. Earlier today, I commented my thoughts on a tier list, which I'll include below. I'm not the best player, maxing out my pub stats sometime in season 5 and recently getting into scrimming with the pop-up cups and discords.

However, I am very into is the pro scene, constantly watching skirmishes, customs and nightly scrims. I also work in analytics and tech, so my mind likes to break everything down and organize it in a thoughtful and concise manner. Started playing the game in October, so I've seen it all and I'd like to think I have a firm grasp of the meta and how it shifts/changes on a biweekly basis.

Let's get into it.

**Personal Tier List:**

So basically here's a tier list if you're trying to sweat every game and only take the best items.

Top-tier, absolutely game-shifting items:

* Heavy AR
* Purple/Gold SCAR
* Deagle
* Blue/Purple/Gold Pump
* Quad Launcher
* RPG
* Rift-to-Go
* Grappler
* Double-barrel shotgun with grappler
* Launch pad

Mid-tier, upgrades your loadout and outplay potential:

* Suppressed Scar
* Heavy shotgun
* Green pump
* SMG
* Heavy Sniper
* Stinks
* Clingers
* Grenades
* Grenade launcher
* Port-a-fortress
* Spike trap
* Turret

Lower-tier, not great loot that can hinder your play in late game or endgame:

* Regular AR
* Tac shotgun
* Double-barrel without grappler
* Thermal scoped AR
* Scoped AR
* Bolt-action sniper
* Hunting rifle
* Dynamite
* Port-a-fort
* Balloons

Bottom-tier, the worst of the worst items for trying to get the dub:

* Burst AR
* Six shooter
* Suppressed Pistol
* Pistol
* Chillers

Healing items are all pretty good and situational. 

A couple notes:

Medkits aren't that good anymore for heal-offs. Top tier for healoffs is 2 campfires + 15 bandages.

Minis  are the overall king in the current meta, but if the game shifts to 50  health on kill- slurps and big pots will be meta. Think about this: a  top tier player will kill most players before losing 100 health (out of  the 200 max), so minis won't help him top off. Also using a big/slurp  the middle of a fight will be much more beneficial, as the 50 health on  kill will top off whatever is missing.

Chug jug will always be useful for a full heal out of a supply drop or god-tier chest.

&amp;#x200B;

**How Loadouts Affect Playstyle**

If you guys watch lots of streams you'll notice that pros will admit needing certain items because of certain restraints i.e. in the WR qualifiers, Zexrow on EU prioritized an SMG because he knew that he needed tracking aim over burst damage due to higher ping. 

This way of thinking extrapolates into the way certain loadouts are better for certain players over others. Of course, every pro or serious player tries to get comfortable with the best weapons available, but certain weapons will always be the favorites of certain players. In one scrim game, Sypher said to Nick that he just loved the feel of the bolt over the heavy, and he enjoyed the way it let him go for picks faster and played to his more calculated style of play. This statement is just one example of how varied the loot pool can be and how certain players play better with certain guns, even if the effect is mostly placebo.

Of course, the loot pool is in a bad state, but it's not mandatory to have any weapon other than a shotgun + mobility in my opinion. 

That said, let's run through some examples of the varying loot pool and how different loadouts cater to different players.

&amp;#x200B;

**Loadout Variation**

&amp;#x200B;

The Classic: 

AR

Pump

SMG

Heals

Bolt

&amp;#x200B;

This is a loadout that has been meta since mid season 4, at least meta in the sense of being extremely viable and full of strengths for engagement against almost any other player. A player that runs a loadout like this has no specific playstyle other than being prepared for almost anything. Long to mid-range is covered with an AR/Sniper. Build shredding is quite easy with AR/SMG. The main difference in playstyle is that with a sniper, you need to go for picks on rotations. It's not extremely strong in competitive because the bolt's body damage is easily bandaged/shielded, and there's very little unique counterplay.

The primary strength of this loadout is a balanced attack. With mats, a player can engage at any length or distance and fight both low, mid, and high ground.

The unique play of this kit centers around the rebalanced pump. The max effective range seems to be just over a tile (someone correct me if I'm wrong), so getting the edits or quick peeks are a must for 200+ damage with a blue+ pump. Should the pump whiff - unlike the double barrel - you have enough distance between you and the other player to either close your edit or go for safe tracking with the follow up SMG (blue is recommended for the quick reload time between kills).

Another strength is that dual close range threat with both pump and SMG. Every close range engagement has some sort of shotgun play involved, but elite tracking aim can turn the tide of a 50/50 into a 75/25, so for players who are more in favor of their tracking aim, this kit especially favors them. In fact, with the upgrade of a blue AR into a SCAR, the OG rifle becomes a viable followup to a shotty.

Most of the guns classic loadout is going nowhere, and it's a solid starter loadout when it comes to competitive. Nothing fancy, just basic yet useful guns to get you into the swing of your competitive playstyle.

&amp;#x200B;

The Pop-up Cup

Heavy AR

Pump/Heavy shotty

Grappler

Heals

Heals/Splode

&amp;#x200B;

This loadout has become more and more popular as the season has gone on, with players accounting for the 1500 mat cap and preparing via mobility and healing. This playstyle will stomp anywhere in the right hands, but it's most effective in a scrim style ending. The more chaotic the late game rotations are, the better this loadout is. 96 AK headshots and insane burst damage from either of the two best shotties are crucial in the chaos, and grappler conserves mats majorly. 

Two heals are also a huge benefit because of the RNG involved with the newest moving zones -- slurps are absolutely the move here. Still, the 50 health on kill in these kind of tourneys is huge for rotating in the gigantic moving zones, so the second heal may not be needed. Splode here instead is an absolutely vital part of lategame, with RPGs drastically altering the height discrepancy and allowing for low ground to dominate over high ground.

Unique counterplays with this loadout are grappling into a heavy shotty flick followed with a couple hipfire AK taps. Splode high ground + grapple up for an easy retake. Splode height from low ground for easy kills. Go into storm and grapple to gain height without having mats. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Adapting each loadout**

These two kits are essentially the barebones for any variation and changes. One thing I will say is that the deagle's buff have indeed made it a top tier weapon. Used properly, it can take the place of splode in that popup cup kit. It's instant one-shot ability on wood walls and recently build structures is extremely crucial for any wall replacing or barrel stuffing. Gold deagle + gold pump is an elite combo that is almost always a kill if you can hit your shots (assuming they don't have traps). 

Now to playstyles, here are a few weapons that you can throw into your loadout based on how comfortable you feel with each. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heavy sniper

Quick one shotting of a new wall or wood wall is a major outplay ability especially when mats are at a premium. High ground at the end of games should fear the heavy sniper, not to mention that its one-shot to the body at 150 gives it priority as a top tier sniper. On rotations, aiming for the body is rewarded at the trade off of an extremely long reload. In end game, your outplay potential is highly limited by the 4s reload time of the heavy -- naturally this feels even longer in tense situations. Being able to pick players off at range and also destroy builds in a tight spot, the HS is a good pick for passive players who play gatekeeper and can get a 150 tag or headshot kill on an unsuspecting team/player. 

&amp;#x200B;

Double-barrel shotty

My prediction is that they vault this bad boy, but who knows. In end games with fewer mats, the player base is much more spreadout (fewer box to box fights) and double barrels aren't as effective outside of the traditional end game scramble from season 5/early season 6. Still, if you're grinding out regular scrims, this thing still absolutely wrecks. Without a grappler it's not that useful unless you're a lowground god/can splode or heavy sniper down high ground. Take this if you have excellent aim in tight situations and aren't afraid to risk it for the biscuit with your two shots and infinite reload time.

&amp;#x200B;

Suppressed scar

Another gun that rewards a passive gatekeeping style, this bad boy has great FSA reset and can easily chip down the guys you need to build over in a tight spot. One on one, this gun definitely lacks, thanks to its enormous full auto spread. But if you're the type of play who is confident in rotations - so much so that you play edge for picks - then this version of the scar can be a major advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

Quad launcher

This item is just broken in competitive. Forget the RPG, this thing has so many issues with rockets phasing through builds, a nutty spread in terms of structure damage, and unreal ""outplay"" potential with clips of 4. Nothing is more annoying these days than quad launcher spam, and it burns through the mat cap real quick. Find one of these and press M1 to win. Real talk, the only counter to the quad is mobility and waiting out the 4 rockets with smart builds and the illusions of where you are. Its strength is pretty much everywhere; just don't rely on it too much for player damage and you'll shred your endgame down to 50/50s -- if you use it from height, force everyone to fight below you by blowing up their builds and then cleaning up the remnants.

&amp;#x200B;

Rift-to-Go

Best item in the game, enough said. Take this in your loadout if you have space, drop your AR if you have to. Grappler + this is almost a free top 3 as long as you don't choke massively.

&amp;#x200B;

Stinkers

Not much needs to be said about these other than the fact that you can stack 6 now, and it's often times that mid game fights are decided by proper stink placement. Getting people to reposition (especially with the moving zones that mean most players end up taking some storm damage) at the risk of losing health is an amazing advantage. One of the biggest points for these is that if you throw them in a different area, the overlapping area (think about it like a ven diagram) does double damage. 

&amp;#x200B;

In golf players can play in professional tournaments with cash prizes as Amateurs which means they just can’t accept prize money. They still get sponsorships recognition and eventually turn pro if and when they are ready. That isn’t an age or legal related thing but it seems like a solution for all these great sub-16 year old Fortnite players who qualified for the Winter Royale and will qualify for future tournaments but can’t play at the moment due to their age. 

If it really is a legal issue with accepting prize money under 16, why not let them play as “Amateurs” who can’t accept prize money? The exposure is worth a ton for them especially if they place high in the tournaments and I think these kids(mongraal, mrsavage and several more) will definitely place high if they play even a handful of these events. They will be flooded with sponsorship deals and all sorts of other stuff to help bolster their careers. 

These kids are arguably just as good or better in terms of raw skill than any of the big name pros. They at least deserve a chance to promote themselves by competing in these things. Fortnite isn’t going to be around forever and to deny them the chance to gain recognition through these tournaments is a damn shame.

As someone who has been playing since a week after the game itself launched, there have been ups and downs, and mistakes and repairs made by Epic (imo). I'm not saying that the game is anywhere near perfect right now, but a part of growing the most popular game is experimenting and inputting trials and errors. Had Epic not ran some awful and laggy tournaments in the beginning, we would not have a community-wide loved Pop-up cup where every player can play on a more competitive level.

Epic still hasn’t taken the means to create central servers, or even split the games on east and west.

1. Don't take ""flick"" shots. I get it's fancy and looks cool when you pull it off. But it won't make you any better. I know so many of my friends that make this mistake too. Don't do it.



2. Limit jump shots. This is another crucial one. With the small range an analog stick has it's hard to be precise when jumping on a sens 6&gt; try to limit these.




3. Go for snapshots on the ground. I can't stress this enough the aim assist in this game is ridiculous. Just hover your crosshair close to his head. Snap in with your left trigger and shoot right away. This helps you hit your shota way more consistent and is the biggest tool in shotgun fights.




4. Snapshotting. This technique is pretty well known but a lot of people using it wrong. Instead of bonehead spamming ads with an ar try to use it on a weapon like the deagle. It works just like the shotgun. Hover over the enemy quickly snap in and shoot. This also works with hunting rifles which is really effective on midrange when there's little bullet drop.



That was basically it. As for consistent AR aim and Snipers that's all up to practice and having a good sens (usually low works better) personally i never pick up snipers because i'm way more effective with splodes or other utility since sniping on console is really hard.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm writing this post to inform everyone of something myself + many other Twitch users have noticed. I have a good chunk of the story and I feel other parts will come in later. One thing that makes any sport interesting, basketball, football, e-sports are the storylines. They add depth to the people we're watching and at times can add additional stakes to the events. With that being said, a huge storyline is brewing and no, I'm not talking about Kittyplays. 

&amp;#x200B;

So today I logged on to Twitch and flipped between the usual channels, 72hrs, Chap, Zexrow, and Cloak. I noticed that for the now 2nd day in a row Cloak and Vivid were doing the popup cup together. As many of Poach's Twitter followers are aware, he's taking a break for a couple of days to ""clear his head."" Perfectly respectful choice and this explains why Vivid is not duoing with Poach at the moment. What had me a little confused was why Cloak was not duoing with Tfue for 2 days in a row. Many of Tfue's fans are well aware he was traveling back to Florida yesterday and only streamed for an hour to check-in with his userbase. This explains why Cloak was running double with Vivid yesterday. However, I noticed that Tfue was like with 60k people today and still couldn't figure it out. Apparently, I wasn't the only one as other users were spamming this question along with other rumors in both Tfue and Cloaks chat. I honestly brushed this off for the longest time, but you could tell it was starting to bother Cloak and he would never answer the users. (He may have already, but I wasn't there to see it) 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Tfue decided that he was going to duo with free-agent Symfuhnny. A guy who Tfue basically created (in terms of content creation + numbers) and a guy who has been rumored to be going FaZe, but a pro who is still unsigned. Nothing about this seemed to weird, Tfue + Symfuhnny are friends and have done streams with each other before. The only thing I couldn't understand was why Tfue + Cloak were not playing together. A couple of users in Cloak's rumored that Tfue was 30 minutes late for the cup and Cloak decided to play with Vivid instead. That I cannot confirm. But here is where it gets juicy. After all the silence from Cloak he randomly sends a toxic gift to Tfue mid game. You can watch the clip here... 

&amp;#x200B;

\[Cloak\] [https://clips.twitch.tv/AmorphousBoldPlumagePraiseIt](https://clips.twitch.tv/AmorphousBoldPlumagePraiseIt)

\[Tfue\]    [https://clips.twitch.tv/MotionlessThirstyUdonFrankerZ](https://clips.twitch.tv/MotionlessThirstyUdonFrankerZ)

&amp;#x200B;

Just in case you can't read the message Cloak gifts Tfue a skin with a giant nose and writes ""This skin's nose still wasn't as big as Symfuhnny's"" I'll admit it was a pretty sick burn and Tfue just said, ""Damn, that's toxic"". This one action pretty much confirms there's at least a slight beef going on between Cloak + Symfuhnny and possibly even a little animosity. So what's really going on here? Will Cloak + Tfue play tomorrow? Will Symfuhnny ever be able to go FaZe? Is Liquid still braking up? Are you still wasting your time with silly Fortnite drama? Let me hear your thoughts!

I haven't seen more than a few posts about this but I figure it's gotta be as frustrating to you all as much as it is to me. I just think that for every +1 you get to the kill count, you should get 50 hp. How do you guys feel about this?",FortniteCompetitive

The 6 shooter can drop up to epic rariety and is by far the most useless weapon in the game.

Other items include baloons which have some use but ultimately they are pretty useless.

Chillers: do I really need to say anything more?

Turrets: pretty terrible but use by bad players

Due to all these items spawning as floor loot and chest loot it just means we get less of a chance to get items we really need.

I struggle to find traps and shields in most games now. ",FortniteCompetitive

My name is Cody/Fulmer and I am a professional fortnite player under Trouble Bois. This is my first time doing a Reddit AMA and I look forward to answering any and all questions. 

I am 23 years old and been playing video games ever since the nintendo 64 days. I have a wide ranged gaming history, having played numerous games at a competitive level from achieving high ranks in World of Warcraft, League of Legends, H1Z1, CS:GO and PUBG. The last solo showdown I was the rank #2 PC player to qualify for the summer skirmish and just recently got rank #1 in NA for the winter qualifier at 41 points.

AMA!

What if strong items like these acted on cooldowns instead of charges?,"I find that in a given game I can almost never afford to take shockwave grenades, despite them being one of my favorite items in the game. Same for stinks. 

Almost every other item in the game will be usable across multiple fights, grappeler included. But stinks and shockwaves rarely last a single fight. I get that these items are very strong, but it usually means that I can't afford to devote an item slot to something that will only be usable in one encounter. 

What if these items had infinite uses, but cooldowns instead? So you could use 1 stink/shockwave every 30-40 seconds. Meaning you could get 2-3 uses out of them in a single fight, while also maintaining the item? ",FortniteCompetitive

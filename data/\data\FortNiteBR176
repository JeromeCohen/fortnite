I wasn't the best, but I found it so much fun. And it continued to be fun for me for quite awhile. I got my brother-in-law to play it and he and I spent so many nights playing Duos together. We'd order pizza or Chinese food and we'd play drinking games and such. It was an absolute blast. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I just don't find it fun anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I have never been able to be 'good' at the game. I can't do the building strategies, I can't react quickly enough, I can't accurately hit anyone. I have only won a single game on Duos with my brother-in-law, and it was complete luck (we didn't get a single kill that entire game). I've watched all the strategy videos and practiced and practiced and practiced. But I don't feel that satisfaction of playing anymore because I cannot match the skill of the other players. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, it's not Fortnite's fault at all. It's just the natural order of things. Some people are going to be amazing at this game while others like me aren't. But there was a time when I felt like I had a fighting chance, like I could win a game. Unfortunately, that time has passed, and I cannot play a game and feel like I stand any sort of chance. I join a game and I just feel disheartened. What used to feel like a game of PvP now feels like a literal game of chance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, I enjoyed the absolute absurdity of it all at one time. The influx of new (and crazy) content rocked. Also, it was the best feeling to find someone in the game who you could share a moment with, but now it feels like those moments are so difficult to find. It's not worth the time playing and playing and playing a game I don't enjoy for those tiny moments of bonding. The updates kept the game feeling fresh and I'd find myself excited, but not anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know many of you will think I'm being stupid and I need to get over myself and stop complaining about never winning. I'm expecting it. But I made this post in the hope that maybe there were others out there like me who feel burnt out or something, and that it's not just me being stupid. I never really cared about winning, but I liked feeling that sense of having a fighting chance, like I could hold my own to some degree. Now that that feeling is gone, I'm ready to be done.

&amp;#x200B;

For now, I'm taking a break from Fortnite; I hope you all continue enjoying the game, though!",FortNiteBR

Firstly, glider re-deploy is just not a good addition to the game in general, with this in the game there's basically no fall damage and purpose for jumpads etc. This also allows players to run away from fights a lot easier to run and hide. Secondly, rocket launchers and splodes were already stupidly overpowered in my opinion, and what do you know a buff to splodes making it so you can get shot through damn walls! My hopes are that this will eventually be reverted but I definitely have no say in this, this was definitely one of my favorite games of all time and I wish I could enjoy it again.

Explosive damage is better? Build better. Anticipate, become beter. The way the better players build I can't see how they can't put down some extra wall before going into the sky.

&gt; Hey there,

&gt; So we didn't do a good job of communicating why we are exploring this change. Building as a defensive measure is hugely important, and the safety net it provides is something we don‚Äôt take lightly.

&gt; However, in general, we feel like there‚Äôs a bit of an imbalance between aggressive play and defensive tactics. We‚Äôve seen the feedback you‚Äôve been providing and encourage the ongoing discussion. We‚Äôre evaluating what you‚Äôve been saying as well as what keeping an eye on the effect explosives are having on eliminations.

&gt; In general, we highly value experimenting (as with Glider Re-deploy) and iterating based on your input. We‚Äôre curious to hear your feedback on things like:

&gt; * Is 25% the right amount? What if it were lower?

&gt; * Should all material types have the same damage reduction? That is, should metal have a higher mitigation than wood?

&gt; * Is the aggressive/defensive balance right currently? What other methods might make sense for countering overly defensive play?",FortNiteBR

We need to build upon the base game. The changes made have not sufficed, but luckily the community has been very vocal and Epic are listening- let‚Äôs not take that for granted.

I‚Äôve been doing some critical thinking on what Epic could do to improve the experience for casual and competitive players and viewers alike; I‚Äôve thought about making another buff to the Pickaxe, further weakening structures, etc. but one thing stands out to me as a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù to the game- traditional class-based gameplay. 

Here is my idea: 

Make three classes in Fortnite. Each class will have its perks for farming, building, movement, and destruction. This adds an element of strategy that has been absent from the game. 

Taking some ideas from Fortnite: Save the World‚Äôs monsters, players can be one of three classes- Fire, Water, and Nature. Each class will have a unique ‚Äúweapon‚Äù and a unique movement ability - both of which can not be used against other players, but can be used on builds and will have a cool down. For example: 

*Fire* - The Fire class comes with a Fire Bomb. The Fire Bomb can quickly take down Wooden Structures and can propel players through them- think of a Shockwave Grenade. This class can more quickly farm Wooden materials. 

Pro‚Äôs - Quick farming of Wood. Quick destruction of Wooden builds. Vertical movement through Wooden structures. 

Con‚Äôs - Not very effective against Brick and Metal builds. This means while you can farm and thus build more (mats) quickly, you will have more trouble taking down Brick and Metal than the other two classes.

*Water* - The Water class comes with a Water Hose. The Water Hose can quickly take down Brick structures and when sprayed at the feet, will launch players in the opposite direction for a quick getaway.

Pro‚Äôs - Quick farming of Brick. Quick destruction of brick builds. Horizontal movement on all surfaces. 

Con‚Äôs - Not very effective against Wooden and Metal builds. This is the middle ground. You give up more quick builds (Wood) and more sturdy builds (Metal) in favor of the sweet spot in the middle.

*Nature* - The Nature class comes with a Lightning Strike ability. The Lightning Strike can quickly take down Metal structures, and when pointed at the feet, can launch players directly up in the air (but not through structures).

Pro‚Äôs - Quick farming of Metal. Quick destruction against Metal builds. Vertical movement. 

Con‚Äôs - Not very effective against Wooden and Brick builds. This means that while you will be able to farm and thus build more, sturdier walls, your walls will build slower than the other two classes leaving you at a disadvantage in vertical build fights. 

The idea is that with each class, you favor one material over the others. Players who like to engage in build fights might lean towards the Fire class. Players who would rather avoid build fights lean towards the Nature class. Players who find themselves in the middle will lean towards the Water class. This evens out the playing field and introduces strategy to a game where the better players dominate. This will create an interesting dynamic in competitive play as well. This will also solve the time management issue when farming mats, and will eliminate the need for the several movement changes we‚Äôve seen implemented in the past. Everything in the game will stay the same apart from these new abilities.

Don‚Äôt take my idea for what it literally is, take it for what it represents. While the abilities I put forth might not be the right ones, I‚Äôm sure the entire Fortnite community including the devs at Epic could truly make this work. 

What do you guys think?

I've been getting terrible game performance, including several stutters and hitches and go on to explain them. If anyone else has problems of their own that relates to this topic, leave a comment.*]


I'm a PC player, and I've been getting great fps and smooth performance from this game in season 6. Season 5 had a few ups and downs on the performance, but it was playable at the very least. This all changed right after the V6.21 Update. It looked alright from the patch notes, and I decided to get on in the evening to play and complete the daily challenges with a friend. This was both of our first times playing on this new update; we usually play a lot together and although he has a better PC than me, we still experience the same issues in the game. I'd invite him to my lobby and then we both ready up to get into a game. 

**Joining the game**

It first takes a while to load into the game, and I thought it wasn't going to be that bad as long as we get into the game when the bus starts, and accordingly, we did. However, we were at REALLY low FPS. Less than 10, usually freezing up every other second. When we'd think its good, it immediately goes back down. It's hard to estimate where to drop, and so we get kicked off the bus at the end, just using the auto-run feature to get down. Once we land, the fps stabilizes a bit. Settles around 60-80 for me, but at the most random times it'll randomly spike down to around 5, and back to 60. This constant game stutters or hitches makes the game a bit unplayable. I hope they fix something like this, and I'm also wondering if anyone else is experiencing any problems themselves that have to do with game lag.",FortNiteBR

Why, though, is there no prompt coming up after you click purchase that asks if you are sure you want to purchase it. 
Do you know how many purchases I've made purely by accidentally pressing the wrong button.
It's terrible with Llamas too on STW. It's so simple to accidentally click and waste upwards of 100vbucks.
The curious thing is when claiming a free Llama in STW it will ask if you are sure you want to purchase that Llama for 0 Vbucks. 

Some of us aren't streamers and can't afford to waste Vbucks on accidental purchases. 
So losing 200 vbucks to a crappy Llama or to a stupid emote or skin is so bad especially when it could easily be avoided with the prompt they ALREADY HAVE for free purchases.

My suggestion is have that for everything. 
Whenever you click to buy something it asks if you are sure and you can click yes or no.

Here is my reasoning....

I have a wireless Logitech G903 mouse which works great with the PS4 Pro(which is my console). I also own a Corsair K63 keyboard which does not work at all with the PS4.

The only three options I have are....

1.) Wait for Corsair to care about their products and update them accordingly. It's tragic that they market a keyboard + lapboard combo that doesn't support the systems usually installed in a living room. --- I highly doubt this would ever be an option, because getting an autmoted response is hard enough.

2.) Run a 50ft USB extension cable, put my wireless keyboard in BIOS mode, and play double dutch with every fool that passes by.

3.) (Unfortunately) Connect my keyboard and mouse to a XIM device to emulate a DS4, then plug in a second cheapo keyboard that has supported firmware. Once I am ready to play, I press ""P"" on the second keyboard to get queued with PC/KBM users. I can't touch the gaming keyboard until the game starts, because it will swap my lobby type before I join.

I don't want to buy a PC just for FortniteBR, cause I have a PS4+VR. I simply want to game in my living room on KBM with KBM users. A combination of Sony's garbage Bluetooth support and Corsair's inability to resolve firmware issues brings me to beckon......

Please Epic and friends, add a manual option to allow console/controller players to always play in KBM lobbies. I don't want to be ""that guy"" with a XIM in a DS4 lobby.......I refuse to be. I will continue to press ""P"" on the KB for eternity if I have to, but I'd prefer not to. :'(

Personally, I took to the 'ultra-agro' playstyle because I loved using the building system as a movement mechanic rather than a defense mechanic. Over the past couple seasons, Epic has slowly destroyed what made this game special. No other game allowed you to use any building mechanic in a combat scenario and supported CQB as much as Fortnite did. This is why I'm really sad to say that I'm quitting Fortnite until they go back to how things were. Some people might say ""just adapt to the new mechanics stupid idiot"" but the new mechanics suck. The Grappler is unbalanced because they just took the skill required to approach an enemy in a 1x1 out of the players' minds. If you have a grappler, all you have to do is click on the top of the build and start building. Even the old trick of placing a trap in your 1x1 doesn't work anymore because people found out you can still build after using the grappler, which made it even worse because now people get INSTANT high ground and you can't do anything except hopefully use your own grappler that you found randomly, and if you don't then get fukt kid! SMGs are another pain in my back, although they have died down significantly. You basically can't use a pump shotgun without it, because it doesn't make sense to require the player to re-aim to get another chance to kill the enemy but it does make sense to allow players to point in the general direction of the enemy for a second to get another chance to kill the enemy. No one asked for the quad launcher. Or the rocket launcher. Or the explosive buff. Or anything having to do with rare insta-kill weapons (i dont like snipers either, fite me). It's not fair to force me to fight against a player that randomly found a weapon that shoots 4 rockets in rapid succession. If I run out of mats, then I might as well drop all my items. Speaking of which, what the hell are they doing with mats right now? They made it so you have to farm for at least 3 minutes to get an acceptable amount of wood to fight with, any less will cause you to die early. Building is trash anyway, ever since they added Turbo Build. It's the only game mechanic that ruined someone's career (jk) and one of many that ruined a game. It used to take a semblance of skill to use building offensively and even more skill to compete for high ground but after they made it so half the job is automatic, any kid with a mouse and keyboard can play the game. And this wouldn't be a bad thing if everyone wanted what they were doing, but we don't. Almost none of the things they've introduced have been approved by the community. A lot of it is hated by us, and a lot of it is tolerated by us. I can go on and on about what I miss about the game and hopefully what many others miss about the game. This all culminates to why I've taken the hard decision to stop playing Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr: Fortnite did a lot of things I don't like and won't listen to it's players so I'm trying to convince people to stop playing Fortnite with me

**as much as I love this game, listen closely real quick...**

Let me explain, people don't only want to see new stuff, coming daily, week by week to keep em' entertained, people also want game to fit it's purpose, the original idea, the idea that makes the game unique. TLDR; Fortnite is a battle-royale game, in which you can simply build stuff to help you progress the game, win player versus player situations by building yourself to a advantage and more...

As much as people don't want to get bored, you need to think about that people actually want to have fun, want to get better and they want to feel some progress. Changing core mechanics of the game; for example 'building', 'gliding' won't make people happy, since they were used to some different style since beginning.

**Let me explain how to fix this:**

1) Leave core mechanics of the game as it was first mentioned to be; build to win; fall and die when you're overbuilding. (We all have been going through this, building random stuff, then learning how to build, then double ramp wall flooring etc...)

2) Don't add meta changing mechanics/weapons (C4, Double Barrel, Quad Launcher - completely useless, people will just get angry at something being more of a advantage than other weapons)

3) Why would we nerf building in first place? It was our first core mechanic and unique idea of the game. (I would say, boost material gather by 10/20%)

4) Let people learn, get better. (Making Shotgun/SMGs better than Shotgun/Shotgun just by adding delay is kinda way to welcome new players, but you don't have to lower skill gap, people should get better at game as they progress through countless hours of playing it. I also got killed multiple times until I killed someone when I first started playing, but that is OK, you are always going toward some progress/learning - same goes with soccer, hockey etc.)

As much as I love this game since Season 3/4, I'm currently getting really bored and pissed of over stuff that keeps killing me. (I'm not talking about better players.)

Honestly, I haven't been gaming as much as I'm through all my life until I found Fortnite.

**I DO LOVE THIS GAME, BUT PLEASE KEEP PEOPLE ENTERTAINED AND HAPPY, DON'T MAKE UNNECESSARY CHANGES**

Best of luck to all of you guys &amp; feel free to hire me as a community manager, I'm unemployed currently.

To no shock the little kid was ecstatic, to me it's a few pixels on the screen but to him it meant a lot more. He has ADHD and with that he doesn't have the best social understandings so I try and look after him as much as I can.

My brother isn't a fantastic player, probably best described as a 'bot' as some of you would say. He mostly enjoys farming down tree's and bouncing around on those purple lava things in the infected like area. His combat level is non existent, so he often dies a lot without putting up a fight. 

The issue is recently he's been getting a lot of hate messages, for the skins he uses and his lack of ability with them. He gets threats of how his account will my deleted for 'account buying' as well as various words I really want him to learn.

So we didn't do a good job of communicating why we are exploring this change. Building as a defensive measure is hugely important, and the safety net it provides is something we don‚Äôt take lightly.

We‚Äôve seen the feedback you‚Äôve been providing and encourage the ongoing discussion. We‚Äôre evaluating what you‚Äôve been saying as well as what keeping an eye on the effect explosives are having on eliminations.

In general, we highly value experimenting (as with Glider Re-deploy) and iterating based on your input. We‚Äôre curious to hear your feedback on things like:

*Is 25% the right amount? What if it were lower?
*Should all material types have the same damage reduction? That is, should metal have a higher mitigation than wood?
*Is the aggressive/defensive balance right currently? What other methods might make sense for countering overly defensive play?

Now I know that the game isn't supposed to be super sweaty 24/7 and we're meant to have fun while playing. But I'm not having fun playing solo and engaging my opponent in a build battle and dropping most of his health just to have him jump off when we're 15 stories high and chase him around the map to a location where I'll run into more people and have them kill me while the person that I was originally gonna kill is hiding somewhere healing. 

The game is fun when it requires thinking strategically. Getting a win has become a lot easier especially for people that are good at the game. Now you can easily land at Wailing and farm a bunch of mats and build a sky base. Sky bases were always one of those high-risk, high-reward situations especially at the games release. Now, you're not really losing anything from being shot down anymore and it makes winning extremely less satisfying knowing that I won't die from fall damage anymore. 

The game has essentially almost become a game of cat and mouse. As I previously stated, If I engage with a person in a build fight when I'm playing solo, if I easily outmatch him he can easily run away. Prime example of this was a game I played last night in solo. Got into a build battle with a decent builder but I still has an edge over him and dropped most of his health when we got 15 stories high. He jumped off of our builds and flew away and I followed him because I needed to kill him for his mats and his ammo because I'm running low on both. But he glided to another enemy and managed to not get spotted by him, but instead I was spotted and now I'm fighting someone completely new with a low amount of material and ammo, while the guy that I could've killed is off healing somewhere in a safe location and I ended up dying because I didn't have much to defend myself.

This is honestly not the change that i want and I'm sure a good amount of the community doesn't want either based off of previous posts. Usually when EPIC adds something to the game I keep and open mind and most of the time I like the change and if I don't like the change I'll find a way to adapt. But as far as this change goes...

This ain't it chief.",FortNiteBR

Glider redeployment encourages more and higher build fights which exhausts materials, making it harder to make it to the final circle with as many materials as in the past. Also promotes mobility and more action.

Buff for Splodes: going to counter the more excessive building as mentioned earlier, which is good for epic as too many structures being built really slows the servers down. This is a good way of helping to balance that out. It makes splodes even more attractive in late game and will help the stagnant turtle game we see in the pro games with 65 people in the fourth circle all in the little gazebos. 

I really think these changes are going to really affect the play style a ton of people have become used to and we might get to see a different face of late game play styles. I really think these changes are going to make the game a little more exciting, fast paced and aggressive. Epic very well could revert everything to how it was but I think there‚Äôs a bigger idea at work here.

I can only think of ONE way that Epic Games can save Fortnite (If they REALLY even care to), and that would be to implement a ""Classic Fortnite"" game mode.

Classic Fortnite? What is classic Fortnite? Season 2-3? Exactly.

When I started playing Fortnite, there wasn't even turbo-build...I had to literally click every action I wanted to make..couldn't build around ANYTHING...I'm not necessarily saying that's what I want.  The building mechanics of Fortnite are A++++...I'm referring to more of the gun play.  

Let's be real, the gun play on Fortnite sucks.  We don't need a P90, Double Barrel Shotguns, (Could even live without the heavy shotgun...I barely use it anyways) Suppressed AR, Heavy Snipers, etc...

ALL WE REALLY NEED as far as weapons are a shotgun, an AR, an SMG, a sniper, and MAYBE an RPG/grenade launcher.

WHY has Epic Games made this SO DIFFICULT? Trying to implement new items, and game mechanics that are TOTAL FAILS!

In my opinion, if we don't get a say at least in what they update..then this game will die off but will still go down as one of the best games in the history of gaming..let's be real it's an AMAZING game..\*WAS..

Glider redeploy is almost universally hated and ruins gameplay by making every fight either a build battle or shotty/SMG duel. YOU ARE GASLIGHTING THE COMMUNITY BY SO SMUGLY STATING YOU'VE HAD POSITIVE FEEDBACK ON THE REDEPLOY MECHANIC. That level of dishonesty is absurd. 

Keeping glider redeploy is a HUGE mistake, and it appears to be here *permanently* from the roadmap of updates to it laid out in the patch notes.  

Allow me to list things glider redeploy makes pointless or near-so: Shockwave Nade, Grappler, Launch Pad, every vehicle in the game, map spawn rifts, the storm breaking structures, the entire act of shooting an enemies builds down, rift to go, every non-CQC gun that can't one shot from full health (as they'll just fly into your asshole the instant you hit them from range if you don't get the kill), and stink bombs on enemies built more than 3-high (which TBH was the only use for them anyway). I can't think of more, but there's even 3 or 4 loading screen tips that are now irrelevant that reference fall damage and building cover. 

NOT TO MENTION explosives were already overpowered at close range with the quad launcher. Adding splash through everything now makes them impossible to counter at almost every range. You can't block rocket spam with builds any more, and that was the *only* option to counter before this patch. 

So this patch even managed to make BUILDING pointless if it's anything but a ramp for gliding; neutering the only unique aspect of the game compared to other BR competitors. 

I'm honestly so dissapointed, as are large portions of the community. And the fact that Epic is straight out ignoring the majority is beyond unsettling. How a game could go from fantastic to utterly trash within a period of 3 months WOULD be shocking if it weren't for Epic previous track record of butchering their own titles by going against community wishes... Im looking at you, Paragon.

My advice would be to keep in mind that history repeats itself. I personally will be refunding all possible purchases and uninstalling the game, as this is *very clearly* the beginning of the slow, painful end for Fortnite. Any Paragon players will echo this sentiment and advice. 

TLDR; Read the post you lazies

Vaulting, Zombies, Re-Deploy, Splodes buff??","I know I ain't the only one, cause everything i read about is how stupid these updates are.. I literally play once a week now because of all this stupidness -- i went from playing hundreds of games to maybe 10 games.  


Re-Deployment  


Redeploy is awful - it makes the storm absolutely useless.. no matter what now, i just build up and fly... last circles that force people out.. BUILD UP 3 RAMPS AND FLY!!  
Get in a build battle? no worries - the guy flew away anyways.. just wasted 400 mats, now he flies away, i chase him, and re-waste another 400mats in a 2nd build battle for him to FLY AWAY AGAIN with 5hp!!  
Materials are being ran through quicker than ever before with re-deploy and it is a disaster to the game...  


Building smartly is now useless... People can just build straight up without triple reinforcing because if you get knocked down, you just fly when you fall anyways....  
A better builder outbuilds you and you edit a hole underneath a backwards ramp to knock him down.. no need, he will fly right ontop of you now!! You can never re-take highground ever again.. so you better just fly away and let him chase you.. and rinse and repeat... so stupid epic.. so stupid!  


\----------------------------------------  


Zombies - Cube monsters - whatever these things are  


Don't even get me started on how awful these things are - take them out of Battle Royale before you lose your entire playerbase  
Can't hear a god \*\*\*\* footstep within 50feet because of these stupid monsters  
Trying to get a clutch heal off during the fight of your life??? Don't worry - these idiot monsters will not only ruin the audio around you, theyll knock down your walls, follow you, attack yoru square, and give away your position to the exact square, and even help the enemy break you wall for you...  


You just broke a guys shield? dont worry, he'll edit a hole through his builds and just shoot a couple monsters from afar to get his shield back - no need to loot.  


\----------------------------------------  


Vaulting Guns  


Why are you vaulting guns that work good? Dual pistol vault ?? UM WHAT? why? how? \*\*\*\* epic..  
Guided missile i can understand - that gun is absolute trash.. but dual pistol? its perfectly balanced.. its literally like the six shooter.. with way less bullets and a little damage.. i dont get it.  
The semi- auto sniper?? I dont get either.. way less damage - more shots at a time.. perfect for if a guy is on the move but less damage because you don't have to reload -- a good balance.. I personally never liked them, only start to mid game weapon - but i use to rock the purple ones.  


\---------------------------------------  


Splodes  


So now some noob that gets an RPG at the start of a game and can shoot it at me, I CAN BLOCK IT, and still lose my health???? At the start with no shield?? Are you guys even thinking about your game??  


SO no in squads, 4 of us can shoot at a guy in a 1x1, and kill him with 100HP through walls??  
YOU MEAN I CAN SHOOT A QUAD LAUNCHER - ALL 4 BULLETS AT HIS WALL AND KILL HIM WITH 100HP?? SO HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO SHOT AT LIVING ???  


You guys don't even care about your game anymore...  
give up.. i was praying and hoping for some new weapons - a splodes buff - a shotty fix... anything to help us play the game..  


Not the complete opposite..  
Sorry Epic.. You've lost one of those players that plays a lot and spends lots of money  


Good luck with your stupid updates.

I just think more time is needed to properly assess this mechanic. Maybe it‚Äôs too much and something needs to change. Personally I think they could use a longer reload time. Point is that Epic is pretty one top of changes and balancing and if they feel it‚Äôs too strong they will reel it in.

Also I think people forget that this game is a shooter. They primary core of this game is shooting. Building is a support mechanic and should be treated as such.

The texture would change the way the material looks, and its symbol on the hotbar.

I thought of 2 textures that could be added, for stone a grey flat concrete wall. And for metal possibly a bunch of purple cubes stuck together or possibly a flat cube texture, mabye different styles for that one (flat and cluster of cubes style). These would not change the durability of the materials though, it would only change the way they look.

We aren't the demographic Epic want.","In the past month Epic have made it abundantly clear, they're aiming Fortnite at small children. Now I know you could argue that has been the case from the start, but skill has always set the little kids from the grown ups. 

Children all around the world are obsessed with fortnite, only problem is that most of them suck at the game, I imagine that is pretty off putting for them, less kids play less v-bucks are bought.  Adults are more likely to be tempted to stray by other older franchises e.g Red Dead. So what do epic do? They dumb down the gameplay so even a toddler has a chance, hell stick a rocket launcher in their hands now and even a literal baby has a good chance of killing the best of fortnite players.

This goes for new players too, noobs are put off by the huge skill gap, they'd rather just not play than put in time like the dedicated fans have, so easiset solution to keep them is again dumb the game down. 

The gliders, balloons, zombies have all served one purpose, make building less effective; building being the biggest advantage in a fight, a skill that takes time to learn properly. 

We need to accept Epic don't care about our opinions, the game is now being catered to new players and small children. It's greed plain and simple, I guess making billions of dollars just isn't enough.",FortNiteBR

I just can‚Äôt enjoy this game anymore.

Epics been making shady moves and been as transparent as a rock since the end of season 4, and it‚Äôs just escalated beyond control. We‚Äôve yet to receive official statements on most of the general state of the game and directions moving forward. We as a player base have no choice but to adapt to the constant bombardment of new content or quit.

Zombies should‚Äôve been an LTM mode. I can‚Äôt think of one item epic released or new mechanic that epics deployed that shouldn‚Äôt have been put through the ropes in a play test server, and speaking of new things, what exactly are the positive results we keep hearing about? What are you testing internally? What feedback besides ‚ÄúI like it‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù is being used? There are several individuals who have analyzed very specific points of the game and brought it up for discussion on various platforms, and they all go overlooked, like they aren‚Äôt doing actual quality data analysis, which it seems Epic needs more of.

Think about it, were taking to social media right now to scream about how bad this explosives buff is for the game. That means that this got through rounds of play test and quality assurance, and epic still gave the green light. Remember the P90 post release? Or the silenced SMG post buff? Why wasn‚Äôt the glider redeploy mechanic thoroughly tested in solo/ duo/ squads LTM‚Äôs? It seems like information is simply being compiled between all playlist regardless of inherent differences. How long did we deal with the guided middle shooting due north no matter where we aimed just to have it vaulted two weeks later?

And now we have content being brought in that we have no idea of it‚Äôs viability until it‚Äôs in game. New content has been either *meta changing* (grapplers, redeploy) or an absolute waste of talent in the design and programming departments (six shooter)

I stayed hopeful during season 5 that the downward slope I was seeing was just having fun ideas and concepts being thrown in so everyone could relax and have fun playing fortnite during summer, but now I just can‚Äôt find the motivation to load up a match at all, not knowing if the core mechanics I practiced today will be fundamentally shattered the next, or if the weapon load out I adopted will be worthless in a week.

Epic, if you want to help this game, you have to bring back public test servers, be more transparent in the reasoning and analytics used for the updates and (horrible) balance updates, and stop trying to release shit every 2 weeks.",FortNiteBR

Y‚Äôalls attitudes are some of the most disrespectful, spiteful, and downright hateful (not to mention childish) that I have ever seen. Instead of screaming hysterically about what‚Äôs been done, figure out a way to change/alter it to make it more balanced. 

The elitist attitude in this sub regarding skill gap and building is actually appalling. And tbh, I‚Äôm surprised that there aren‚Äôt more people who are sick and tired of their enemies using building to run away and hide instead of facing them. 

That being said, the way to fix the rocket splash damage through walls can be done in a few ways. 

1. Increase the delay between shots

2. Full health walls block 100%, half health 50%, etc

3. Damage blocked is adjusted to which material is being used. I.e. a half health metal wall will block more than a half health wood wall

4. This will apply to ALL splash damage for rockets/explosives

This way you‚Äôre increasing the skill gap because you have to consciously choose which material you are using to building instead of just spamming whatever‚Äôs handy AND requires you to be more precise and prevents rocket spamming.

Remember when epic went from nerfing the hell out of spike traps to a huge buff, then finding the middle ground? Some people are so unbelievably ignorant about how collecting game data works. Obviously the rocket buff is some horse shit, but relax, epic isnt incompetent. They currently havent established a separate ‚Äúcompetitive mode‚Äù and use pub matches a data gold mine to make tweaks. 

We are just guinea pigs for their patches in all honesty. If you are so bent out of shape by a temporary change (i assure you it wont be permanent) then quit the game. This subreddit has gone from sharing fun experiences, explaining great tips, to a whiney, snobby, threatening community who isnt ok with any change. Trust the developers, and if you are going to raise concerns, at least use reasonable points and have a purpose to it, not just screaming and ranting. 

Epic is aware people are unhappy with the change, and obviously knew thatd be the case. They are compiling data and exploring ways to better combat turtling and how to better refine splodes. So fucking relax for a bit and either quit the game or wait it out, newsflash: you quitting wont do shit, player base is still enormous. 

Last thought: if glider redeploy is here to stay, they are clearly trying to see if theres a way splodes can punish a player skybasing or hiding amongst massive builds. You just watch, in the coming days/weeks we will see a game change that balances redeploy in some fashion.

It seems very difficult to counter. But it also seems like everyone is forgetting some things.

1. Everyone has been wrong about their initial impressions before. Prime example: most people thought the double-barrel was useless, and then it became the most powerful shotgun in the game.  We need to give things time to work out before we reach definitive conclusions.
2. This is a beta game. No, that isn't an excuse for shitty updates and changes. But it IS a thing to remember as we all collectively complain. There have been plenty of problems and bugs that have hurt this game in the past, but Epic swoops in and fixes them. Shotgun consistency, double pump, guided missile, and plenty more. 

I understand the frustration, because I really do think this change sucks lol. But I'm not gonna ""quit the game"", as some radicals have claimed they will do.

Is not the perfect state the one we have now, BUT they can make adjustments. YOU ALL ACT LIKE IS THE END OF THE WORLD. This happens after EVERY SINGLE UPDATE that add something new.

First of all, the majority of players who play the game are casuals, and not even here on reddit. I'm a casual player, and i love the new idea. Not in the state we have now, but as i said they can do something about it like:

You take 20% dmg behind wood, 10% behind brick, 5% dmg behind metal. 

Or make the drop rate of rockets / rocket launchers lower.

Increase reload time. And so on. There are things that CAN BE DONE. 

Also, a rocket travel SLOW, you have time to build a wall - stairs and run behind and put another wall or something. You can just freaking MOVE out of the way. I agree that they need to adjust it, and not let it exactly like it is now, but is a neat idea. ",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôve got some not so popular opinions on it and will probably get downvoted to infinity, but here is my suggestion.

If you think about it, explosives should deal damage through walls. After all, its a freaking explosion, some sticks arent just gonna stop that. Explosions are powerful and should deal damage through a wall. It just logically makes sense. 

The community obviously hates that. Players can‚Äôt just turtle and counter explosives with a simple wall or ramp and they don‚Äôt like it. Players have not found a way to work around this yet and they‚Äôre frustrated. So here is my solution.

1) make explosives much more rare. If they‚Äôre going to be strong like this, they need to be rare, only a couple being dropped a game. This way, explosives can still do what they logically should, but they are not being used in every single gun fight. Making them a rare drop would make them very special, people would be excited to get one. The map is filled with rocket fights right now. Limiting explosive drops would get rid of this toxic environment

2) explosive damage through building should deal different amount based on the material. Metal should protect you better than wood. It just logically makes sense. Change the damage amounts based on the material used for protection

3) lower the number of explosives held. They should be more of a situational item. You should not be able to spam explosives given their current state. For example, if you get into a crazy build fight or something, you should be able to shoot a rocket or two to try and get some tactical advantage. Lowering the number of held rocket ammo would force players to be more tactical in their use of rockets. 

Obviously i havent worked everything out here, but just some ideas that came to my mind. Any constructive criticism?",FortNiteBR

Now i understand that i am only one voice and maybe no one else agrees with my opinion on the state of the game but i feel like the majority of players still playing the game would agree with me on the following points. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before i get into listing them out i would like to say up until zombies were introduced i was easily a 20 -30 hours a week player.  Everyday i would look forward to getting off work, going home and firing this game up.  I would look forward to saturdays because i knew i would be able to stream this game for 6 to 10 hours.  Once zombies were introduce my play time dropped to maybe 10 hours.  I have no longer had the drive to play the game.  I would still get the itch to play but once i fired it up and was subjected to the onslaught of zombies and the ridiculous noise blaring into my headphones they caused my desire to play went away instantly. I would still play but my sessions became a lot shorter and i would find excuses to stop playing altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Removal of bounce pads** \- This was out of no where.  No one was talking about them being OP.  Neither the casual player base or the competitive players were talking about these at all.  Once day Epic removes them only to replace them with arguably the worst trap introduced to this game.  Freeze traps are basically usable.  I literally drop them in game so they dont get in the way of cycling.
* **Glider Redeploy** \- This change is honestly not horrible but its not good.  Fall damage has a place in this game since there is building.  Mobility items are no longer a necessity because players can now build up and glide.   You should be forced to think about how high you are building and carry something that can save you if someone shoots you down (launch pad, bouncers, new impulses).  
* **Zombies** \- This update was mind blowing.  Why did they think this was a good idea?  I honestly felt like it was forced and a last min rush to throw something in the game for Halloween.  The sound they cause is unbearable.  You cant hear anything when they are around you except for the noise they cause.  As far as i can tell very few people in the community actually like them in the game.  The game is not PVE its PVP.  Also, Epic seems to realize their mistake since they took them out of the Fall Skirmish.  If they honestly thought they were a great idea wouldnt they have left them in the game for one of if not the biggest fortnite tournament to date?
* **Grappler** \- Another weapon put in the game so people do not have to build.  This seems to be a trend with Epic.  They seem to think the casual player base will be around forever.  Whoever at Epic believes this nonsense should be fired ASAP because he will be the reason this game becomes irrelevant.  Epic continues to introduce this type of update for the casual player base who does not care or want to learn how to build.  What Epic does not realize is that these weapons are far more powerful when used by good players and increase the skill gap even more.  I dont know how Epic does not see this.  It was very apparent with bounce pads even though no one was complaining about them.
* **Explosive update** \- the 25% damage through structures is INSANE!  Not only do people have to deal with splode spam now they also have to deal with getting damaged by it.  What exactly is the counter to someone with high ground spamming you with rockets?  You used to be safe by boxing yourself in until they ran out but now if you choose that you are dead.  If you try to move you are dead.  Literally the only thing you can do is hope you have impulse or grappler or launch pad bc its the only thing getting you away fast enough to reset.  I am pretty sure this was another change Epic added for the casual player base.  The casual player base would not box up when getting hit by a rocket so they wont care about damage coming through structures.  The RPG was already the most OP weapon late game and now it just got even stronger.  I really would like to hear Epics reasoning on this one.
* **Removal of dual pistols** \- Why?  Honestly just why?  I did not hear many complaints about these.  I used them early game in place of a shotgun if i couldnt find a shot gun.  A lot of people liked them.  These were honestly the one of the best early game drop weapons behind the shotgun and i am really dumbfounded why these were even removed.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a ton of other things i could include but they were introduced a while ago, further back than the grappler.  This is just a small example of things introduced recently to the game that have caused a lot of uproar by the majority of the player base.  I understand that there are some people that like these updates but understand you are in the minority.  

&amp;#x200B;

Epic continues to try and win back/ keep the casual player base and for some reason Epic does not understand that these players WILL move on no matter what.  They are just playing because other people are playing, their friends are playing etc.  Once a new game comes out they will move to it.  This is what the MAJORITY of people who play games do.  In order to keep your game relevant you need to not alienate the core player base.  The people who like the game and will continue to play the game even though new games are being released.  There is a reason CSGO is still as popular as it is today.  Is it extremely popular? NO! But it still has a large player base and its extremely impressive for a game that old to still have such a large player base.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of things Epic has done right with this game, its why its currently the most popular game ATM.  However a lot of the updates they are introducing are counter productive and are geared towards a player base that will eventually leave whether or not that update was put in the game.  They continue to add items to the game that are meant to support the casual player base that does not care to learn how to build not realizing that they are actually far more powerful in good players hands and therefore **increasing the skill gap that already exists even more**.  Epic needs to slow down with the changes they are introducing into the game.  Too many things are changing way too fast and i personally feel like they are not thinking long and hard enough about what they are doing to their game.  It is their game and they can do what they want with it but if they want the game to survive in the long term they need understand the casual players will end up leaving no matter what. ",FortNiteBR

I think this is due to us not really have much in common, its hard for us to bond. He is a huge fortnight fan, and his mother made him a John Wick costume for Halloween (His favorite skin). He was beyond happy. He really loves Fortnight. I took Halloween as an opportunity to bond with him more, so without him knowing I had his mother make me a fortnight costume to surprise him. I scrolled through google looking at different skins and eventually decided to go as what they call ""Rust Lord"". The outfit seemed easy to put together and it had a bad ass feel to it. I even researched some of the more popular dances (The Floss, Best Mates, and Orange Justice) I spent hours learning these 3 dances, I don't consider myself all that coordinated but after some time I felt I had them down perfectly. Halloween night came and my son went out trick or treating with his friends. As they were out I put on my costume before handing out candy to the kids. I was surprised with the amount of kids that recognized my costume, I was a hit. Until this group of kids, dressed up as skeletons, I guess they are called skull troopers nowadays? I dont know, looked like skeletons to me. Anyway, what seemed to be the leader of the group didn't seem impressed with my costume, he actually seemed bothered. In a demeaning tone before even getting any candy he asked if I could floss. That smirk on his face turned into full blown surprise as I dropped the bowl of candy, and put every bit of energy into the best floss I could muster up. I nailed it. Surprised but still unimpressed the leader said not bad, but lets see your orange justice. I don't know what came over me but I completely blanked, he caught me off guard despite my hours of preparation. I couldn't let this 10 year old alpha me so I closed my eyes, gritted my teeth, and started flailing around like an inflatable tube man caught in a hurricane. I finished my dance, and silence followed for what seemed to be an eternity. Next thing I know it the group of skeletons erupted into laughter and started jumping left to right while holding their hand in an L shape formation. I was embarrassed, I slammed the door and I kid you not, thought about crying at that very moment. My man hood compromised by a group of young children, but that wasn't even the worst of it. 20 minutes later my doorbell rings, which is strange considering I turned off the porch lights after that embarrassing incident. I turn the light back on, opened the door, and my jaw dropped. a Group of what seemed to be 50+ characters gathered across my lawn all jumping left and right with simultaneously while forming the L shape with their hands. I yelled at the kids, slammed the door and ripped off my costume. What have I done. 30 minutes later my son comes home and I guess word travels quickly in a small community, he already knew what happened. He didn't even make eye contact with me, I tried asking how trick or treating went and he ignored me, went up to his room and slammed the door. He hasn't talked to me since last night and I really don't know what to do.. I don't think he respects me anymore.",FortNiteBR

For the first time ever, I feel like I need to try another less chaotic and slower paced BR game, which sucks bc Fortnite was once the greatest, most enjoyable shit to do with my friends. RIP it's been a good year. Thanks for the fun Epic.    ",FortNiteBR

Or maybe the bush? Or even shockwave grenades? (practically useless after the glider update) It seems like epic is constantly making this game easier for children who don‚Äôt know how build to play. 25% of explosive damage now goes through walls which means there is no possible counter-play in squads if a full team has RPGs.

386,Kaividian,1541074192,9t8u1d,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9t8u1d/who_named_kevin_a_thank_you/,1,Who Named Kevin? - A Thank You," At 10:34pm(AEST) on the 27th of August, a comment was made on the Tracking the Cube Megathread where the user referred to the Cube as Kevin. Other users were confused by this and inquired into why they had decided to call the cube Kevin. This was their response:

&gt;""*... I think we should come up with a name for it other than The Cube. Sounds boring. Lets call it something fun, like Kevin!* ""

The users that read this were in agreement that the cube should be named and most agreed that Kevin was an appropriate name for it.

At 2:03am(AEST) on the 28th of August, the user, [u/6acee](https://www.reddit.com/u/6acee) created a post with the title [Kevin climbing the hill, he's growing up so fast](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9aq6yz/kevin_climbing_the_hill_hes_growing_up_so_fast/)**.** This post grew very popular very quickly as people were lured in by what was at the time, an unusual decision to name the cube and personify it. As of writing, that post now has 2.8k up votes. This was the moment that kick started the name of Kevin.

Overnight, people uploaded videos and other content where they called the cube Kevin, further boosting the popularity of this name. In time, popular youtubers and streamers began using the name Kevin with even the commentators at the Fortnite Fall Skirmish referring to our purple, six-sided, friend as Kevin.

Two questions I commonly see floating around the forums is ""why was it named?"" and ""who named it?"". The common answer to the first question is to avoid the post being taken down automatically by the bots as posting about the cube had been outlawed. This answer is not correct. 6acee and the first user both believed it seemed like a Kevin to them and so that's just what they decided to refer to it as and clearly, others agreed. To answer the second question is much more complicated. 6acee is commonly credited as being the one who named Kevin, however, he wasn't the first as evident by the comment posted 3 and a half hours earlier. So, by that logic, the original namer would be the first user, however 6acee did not see the original comment.

&gt;""i genuinely did not see anyone else call it kevin. just outta pure luck lmao""

Therefore, the cube was named by two people. However, this answer will not satisfy everyone. To break it down to a single user who named the cube, you have to consider what you base your understanding of origins on. Chronology or popularity? Chronologically, the one to name the cube Kevin is that first user, however, if you consider popularity to be the basis of who named it, then you would consider 6acee as the one who named it.

However, attributing the naming to either the first commenter or 6acee isn't completely accurate. Although they both can be credited for the origins of the name, if it wasn't for the Fortnite community, Kevin would not have taken off the way it did. From user to user it spread, making its way out of Reddit and into other forms of media. We, the community are the ones who named the cube.

The Lil' Kevin challenges and Lil' Kev back bling discovered in the v6.21 patch is a testament to the power that this community has. We named a giant purple cube Kevin just cause we felt like it fit! Just think about how crazy that is and how Epic has decided that they'll go along with it too.

As the first person to publicly refer to the cube as Kevin, I want to give a big thank you to Epic, 6acee and the community for everyone's respective roll in creating the Kevin we all know and love today. As Fortnitemares comes to an end and the cracks upon Kevin worsen, we may be seeing the end of our purple, six-sided, friend. It was a lot of fun while it lasted and I look forward to seeing the next big thing that Epic has in-store for us and how the community will respond to it.",FortNiteBR

He spammed my ramps and I took over 90 damage even before I was close to him.

For some context, this is the change that is now live: 

 **25% of explosive damage will now penetrate through structures and the environment**

In another game immediately after, I was trying to heal in a 1x1 at around 70 health. A player threw a grenade at my turtle. I let the grenade explode because I wanted to see the damage taken (would have just gone straight in to the Playground to test this if my friend was online) and I took 25 damage.

This is not healthy for the game. I understand that Epic wants to counter turtling, but to cater to casuals to this extent is ridiculous. Explosives already cause huge amounts of damage as it is. I've never been overly critical of Epic Games, but I cannot support this change. 

""The Battle is Building"" - how can that be the case now when even building can't protect us from Explosive damage?

Well now that‚Äôs in every game mode ‚Äú why don‚Äôt they just keep it to soaring 50‚Äôs as limited time‚Äù and then I tell him about how it gets better, the weak zombies from STW are now in the game too while you‚Äôre fighting other players online,interrupting your expirence as a whole due to horrible audio. Now with this new update, balloons? Damage through structures? Too much cheesy nonsense and not enough mechanical updates fixing core gameplay. Catering to players who can‚Äôt even tie their own shoe will only get you so far.

Goodbye Fortnite. You were the most fun game i‚Äôve ever played in my 16 years of gaming. I‚Äôll never forget playing squad fill and getting a 7 year old his first win and he freaked so hard. So many memories i‚Äôll never forget. ",FortNiteBR

For example, Hot Ride is my all time favorite glider, but if I even attempt to drop on someone or escape, that person can hear me from a mile away because the music is just so damn loud.

Now, I understand turning off the music would be kinda cheese in a way, because it‚Äôs a strategic advantage to other players. However, a simple counter measure is to just keep the effect noises (such as the boosters on the back) instead.

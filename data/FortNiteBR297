Victory points are earned by playing games, completing challenges, and playing with clanmates. 

Clans can see the leaderboard (measured in Vpoints) within the clan, for Vpoints earned per day, week and month. You could also see the clan leaderboard, with the top 50 clans out of groups of 150 receiving vbucks by tiers, such as 1st gets 1000 to distribute and so on. 

Clans will be able to grant permissions, like in CoC. Clan Leaders can organize fun tournaments, team games, and have clan battles.

Clan Battles would be something like 50v50 but in 25v25.  Winning a clan battle will grant a lot of battle points.

I'm curious to see what you think of my idea, and what you like/dislike about it",FortNiteBR

First off read it all, prior to just reading the first and last sentences. 

-------

The current changes made to editing are poor and make for a bad change to the game's flow and mechanics. 

Why? For one, a player who has built, or secured a wall on another players building by breaking it and replacing it with theirs. SHOULD by all means have an advantage. There are many ways to get away from a player who has done this. Although most players seem to get headstrong and want to fight someone who has the edit on them. If a player has the edit on me, I willingly take the fact I'm at a disadvantage. It happens rarely. Although there are a few things you can do to stop this from ending your game. Fortnite isn't just a loot and shoot and tunnel vision game. It's a physical game of chess with building and out smarting your opponent when they have the upper hand is the upmost important thing to do. 

For example. A player gets an edit on your box while you're 1x1'd. He edits the roof, jumps in. What do you do? Panic and jump around shooting shotties hoping to hit? No. Drop a trap. Edit a wall and leave / build up. Take a fight. There is so much you can do that doesn't have to revolve around taking a L due to someone having an edit on you. 

Now will this combat turtling? No. There was already many things that combat turtling :

• C4
• Grenades
• Clingers
• Rocket Launcher
• Grenade Launcher
• Stink Bombs
• Minigun
• LMG
• Shooting their walls, and leaving to bait them out. 

Just because a player turtles DOES NOT mean you must tunnel vision and try to kill them or get to them. Try disengaging, baiting them out. You'll have more ammo then they will materials, typically. 

Now as for how this changes the game for a player editing a wall to look out. I'm not for this change. Editing to see through was a good mechanic as it allowed good players to foresee their play prior to making it. We can still do it sort of, without editing. You can see through brick, wood, and metal if you damage it. So what's the difference? 

I personally feel that this was an unnecessary change and it has slightly put a dampener on good players in the community. For a final proposal : Possibly Epic should revert the changes BUT make the squares sort of Opaque. This way it's like looking into / out of the storm. You can see, but not as well. Like 85% opacity.

Along with the changes to the explosives, which are more effective now against builds than before, it appears that this is what epic meant when they said they wanted to promote more playing styles and I, for one, welcome these changes. Sure, some fine tuning is still required but the general direction doesn't seem too bad. 

So the first change I'm gonna talk about is the smgs. They've been buffed quite significantly, and many of the top players have said that a shotgun + smg is more viable now than the double shotty. Yes, the accuracy has been buffed, but smgs aren't too hard to counter due to the need to reload often. I see many people confusing 'viable' and 'OP'. Imo, they were viably usable before the buffs too but can you rock just smgs and hope to win every close range engagement? Don't think so. 

The explosives. Now they can break stuff other than the single wall that you put in front of em, serving their intended purpose. Love it. Plus the blast radius of the other explosives isn't as big as the C4's, and you can only carry 18 max. So they can be countered if you know what you're doing. 

Coming to the c4, I don't actually know how I feel about them. Blast radius is huge, but max damage per c4 is 70. They do act as hard counters to building and are quite evidently being made as they are to counter the turtling meta. But I still don't see them being used much even after the buffs in my games so I don't know if they need to be nerfed back to oblivion. 

ARs have enough options for everyone. Now you can do burst AR+smg to break the builds the burst can't. Or go the old way with normal ARs + shotties. Also excited to see how the upcoming Tommy gun solidifies it's place in this. 

Talking about the shotguns, they're still more than viable. The rarities mean something now and if you were using them to break builds, you were doing something wrong. Plus i saw a post today (can't find it rn, tried, if anyone else saw it, please post in the comments and I'll add it here) where someone from epic was discussing upcoming changes in the discord server and they mentioned improving consistency, which is the only problem with shotguns rn imo, other than shots not registering but that's an overall problem that needs to be fixed. 

Miniguns and LMGs, again, are another option now. Just because something can be used doesn't mean it's OP. Double pistols seem fun, haven't had enough time to use but the damage seems great. Maybe needs a slight nerf, but tbh I'd take it in its current form too. 

Overall, very satisfied with the last few patches. You have more options to play now than to get double pumps and double ramp rush everyone. 

TLDR: Most guns are viable promoting multiple ways of playing now. Shotguns consistency still a problem but epic said that it will be worked on in the near future.

Although, instead of nerfing the game so that the ability to make ""high level plays"" is reduced for high skill players you instead simply introduce a ranked system? In 6 months, if Epic continues with the nerf they will have player retention problems (because beyond 1300 hours the incentive will be begin to be lost to improve since these players will come against terrible players all the time).

A high skill gap is not a problem for anyone as long as players are competing against people at the same level as they are. That's the important point. 

Another system would be to have an ""introduction"" period for new players. In which newbies just get matched up against other new players. Then Epic can also do tutorials for certain aspects of the games, and give rewards to get out of this ""introduction"" period when players perform higher level skills (start using editing, for example). Then after the 50 game period (or achieving challenges such as editing), then they get released into the normal games (or begin a ranked ladder).

Epic probably are already planning on a ranked mode. But meanwhile, reducing the skillgap is not good for anyone, especially long term. ",FortNiteBR

Now I know some of you are going to say ""It's bad play to use shotguns on structures"", but if you say that you obviously haven't watched any streamers. The ability to 1 pump any wall within that 300ms of it first being placed is useful, and takes skills. You can suddenly switch up the pace from AR spamming to shotgun against a turtle, which allows you to place your own wall. You can make someone fall in a build fight if they are trying to ramp up on top of you.


I think what Epic did, was saw from the data they collected that not enough people were using SMG even after the previous buff, so they decided to do something drastic just to get the numbers up regardless of how it changes the game.


Shotguns were in a good state after the last nerf. Should've just buffed the SMG and let people eventually realise that it is also a viable rather than nerfing shotguns in a rush to get people to use SMGs.

I'm very happy to hear this, but you'll excuse my skepticism because I've been waiting for this skin for 130 days almost. I know no one knows for sure except for Epic, but what do you think is most likely?

A) The pickaxe and the Red Knight will be in the shop on one of the days they rotate old items in (Monday Tuesday and Wednesday US time) 

B) The Red Knight will return to the item shop sometime during the next 2 weeks but the pickaxe is only for the people who owned her before this release to mitigate backlash of Epic rereleasing a skin that many people say is OG and should never return to the item shop.

C) The Red Knight is not returning to the item shop and the pickaxe simply a reward for people who have owned the skin for so long, a ""goodie"" for supporting the game a while back.

Personally I hope its scenario A because I've always wanted Red Knight, and the leaked pickaxe looks awesome too. Opinions? ",FortNiteBR

People are saying this new editing system is to stop players from edit peeking and getting the advantage. Okay, I can get that if someone’s 50m away it seems unfair, but I don’t think it should be a solid grey wall...
I used to place down floors inside of Trump or Apartments and drop down on enemies when I saw them, or in build battles edit someone down into a trap when they’re above me, but this now somewhat ruins it and makes it more difficult. I’m sure this has been suggested somewhere but I truly and really think that after about 5m, it should start getting blurry or just be blurry in general if the 5m is too hard on the fps somehow. This doesn’t let people see 50m and have protection and peek all around, but doesn’t stop someone from getting a edit kill in a build battle or trying to determine when the perfect time to edit out is.

I see all your complaints about turtling and how it’s bad, but I’ve only seen that when people are trying to heal up during a battle when I got them low, or trying to get me to fall into a trap. Never have I ever encountered someone in a game that edits a wall 100m a way to snipe me. 

And for those who think it should be nerfed because of turtling in build battles I want you to know you must not have a lot of common sense to know you don’t just endlessly spray your gun until you have to reload and then the player hears you do that and knows your distracted then comes out to shoot you... there’s tons of easy counters, you place a stair on their ceiling to trap them in from the top, shoot open a wall, quickly place your own and edit that wall and shoot them, or get close to the ceiling and shoot open the ceiling and place your own and edit it. Or stink bombs, or c4, or lmgs, those are all things that’ll shoot faster than they can build or make them come out.


Too many times have I encountered someone who just chills there spraying until I hear them reload then I come out to one pump them or they stand outside with a shotgun just waiting. This edit nerf is worse than the mats one",FortNiteBR

Like seriously, do people not know how to think outside the box? They just follow where the majority goes because they have some sort of need to fit in and be part of a group instead of try and do things their own way?

The only reason I would say 95% of players go to Tilted is so they can be part of the majority because they can't handle doing things without resorting to doing what everyone else does.

Dear Duo 'Partners' who leave us, the mic-less, to fend for ourselves.

First off, how the am I supposed to tell you I don't have a mic. It's an inherently dumb question to spam repeat. Give it a break. If we have a mic, most likely, we'll talk to you.

If you're smart enough to communicate with my thumbs up and down emotes and quick chat, you're smart enough to not leave every match where your duo partner doesn't have a mic. Give them a chance. They might be as good as you. Some people just play without a mic, it doesn't need to be a requirement for you. Some might have social anxiety and can't deal with your bumbly Twitch self. Sometimes we need a break. You don't need to ruin our games by leaving over it.

8/10 games, you'll spam the mic asking if they have one and then leave (half the time before they've even had the chance to load in, the patch didn't fix everything), and then 1/10 times you'll flame because you think there's no one on the receiving end, since we can't tell you to *fucking stop* with the toxicity. 

The other 1/10 that I left out, you are good guys/gals. You stick around and either are nice over mic / reasonable in your silence. Thank you to those few duo players. ~~I've gone~~ *~~literally~~* ~~17 matches in a row without a decent duo partner.~~

The initial rest of you 9/10 can suck straight from my Moisty Mire.

(Before the hate, I know it's easy to get a mic. There are situations where they just. Can't. Use/Get them. I'm raising kittens right now and I can't use a mic with a cord, which every one sold around me has, and I'm not about to dosh out way too much money just to talk to some hateful teammates.)",FortNiteBR

Thanks EPIC GAMES for making your game more casual thank you very much.

I am eager to hide in a bush next time with rocket + C4, an AR and an smg, then make my way to the zone while avoiding every build fight when I can and exploding bases at a distance.

It is so much fun if the next time the circle ends up on my high-ground, I will finally use the wood and metal I didn't farm but collected from the others stupid players who were farming all the game to build a 1x1 and stay there during the time left! 

Thanks for making this game's skill gaps smaller so I don't have to learn how to build without looking at my mouse and keyboard! 

Thanks for giving Rocket launcher a huge buff, I am so skilled with this weapon, my aim is so perfect with it! 

I understand why you made the cap to 12 rockets so I don't lose to good players who knows how to use grenade launcher! 

But I really would like if you could just, like maybe nerf the snipers headshots and make the headshot do only 149 damage because I think +200 is too much! 
149 damage would be perfect! 
And the semi-auto sniper should do the same damage everywhere which is 99! Because I don't want to die if I don't have shields! 

Haha I would have asked for 74 but it's too much close to AR damage!

My Opinion:

tl;dr - Most of my shotgun shots hit for 8 and it's ruining the game for me

Almost about every game for me now is hitting about 10 - 15 shotgun shots that do 8 damage even though on my screen I am hitting every bullet. This has caused many of my game to lead to a terrible death by a no-skin who doesn't even build. There was a point earlier in season 4 where I was hitting around 1 - 2 shots of 8 damage but now it is far more consistent. I can't keep playing this game until they either fix this or make playground not an ltm.

You cannot see through your panels anymore. Personally, I highly dislike this change. I used edit peeking so much and didn't even realize it until they nerfed it. However, I do see where they were coming from and I agree with the fact that people hiding in 1x1's edit peeking was a bit of a problem. I do think there was a better way to do this though.  


So here is my solution. Instead of making the panels opaque, you could add some sort of effect when someone was editing a building piece. For example, if someone had the edit panel open for a wall, the wall would sort of glow or pulsate. This would leave edit peeking for high-skilled players in build fights, but get rid of people camping in 1x1's, since someone walking by could simply see that the wall was being edited.  


I think this would be a much better solution to the problem, and I hope you take this into consideration.

First off, in the most recent patch, they made shells drop in 4 instead of 5. Completely unnecessary. Second, the obvious building nerfs lately have made the games I play 75 percent farming. Third, the damage debuffs on shotguns have been pretty detrimental. Pumps are arguably the worst shotguns now due to their speed and inconsistent damage. Hell, I played with dual pistols earlier today and they wrecked from close range, consistently. Shotguns should be able to do the same.
The damage nerf when shooting buildings with shotguns was also unnecessary. I don’t see why Epic is destroying the things that we love about Fortnite. Epic, I still love your game, but please don’t ruin this unique masterpiece of a game by removing what makes it so unique.",FortNiteBR

Hand cannons were designed for close-medium range, i guess. It's useless at long range due to it's extreme damage fall off, and even medium-long range because it hits for around 50 damage (an assault rifle can shred and do much more damage much faster). Dual pistols were designed for close-medium range, except it's much faster, and does more damage (if you land both shots, which doesnt matter since you'll shred your enemies much faster than with a handcannon)

2. Dual Pistols literally do more damage at long range than a hand cannon (Not really much to be concerned about since it's only 1 more damage, but a hand cannon should still definitely be much stronger)

3. Dual pistols are really accurate while jumping and running, and the hand cannon is pointless

4. Sounds cool and is literally akimbo guns so you're badass. A hand cannon is badass too but the akimbo guns is badass and useful, so it wins

5. The hand cannon basically turns useless at any range farther than close-medium range due to it's shoddy damage fall-off, at least give it another role as a heavy hitter if you're gonna make the dual pistols much better


Some of my suggestions to improve the hand cannon:
1. Make at least golden hand cannons one-shot headshot

2. Make the hand cannon faster (in exchange for inaccuracy)

3. Make the damage fall-off much less than it currently is

4. Maybe make hand cannons be able to one-shot wooden structures

yeah thats about it",FortNiteBR

People should be buying skins based on how they *look,* not on how rare they are.

People need to understand that for developers that change the map weekly, constantly look for ways to make the game balanced in terms of damage and building, add new items into the game every week, and make new cosmetics every month ( also currently working on the season 5 battle pass ) are probably going to miss a few bugs and glitches but will eventually fix them. Epic has created an amazing game and I think that the ideas they possess are ingenious. All I ask of the fan base of Fortnite is to be more respectful towards the Epic developers and play the game. If Epic has taught us anything, it is to be patient, but that doesn’t mean curse out a dev because your shotgun did 9 damage, it means creating a game is hard and you can’t just snap your fingers to get a new update.

I feel as if Epic is just treating there game as a popular game instead of the biggest game in the world. There should be more preparations for things like this and I don’t understand how they keep happening over and over again. Every single big patch on the game feels like the COD WWII launch but instead of a one time thing with a downwards slope it’s like the slope goes down flies back up and starts to go down even quicker than the last time. Things like this shouldn’t be happening as often as they are. Maybe a bigger team, better servers, anything to prevent things like this. This is another argument for a test server. Sure the updates won’t be every week but I’d rather have an update every 2 to 3 weeks instead of weekly updates with the entire update being broken and having to wait another week for it to be fixed with much more bugs coming along. Don’t get me wrong I expect the bugs and they happen in every game but the server issues are getting a little ridiculous. I really hope Epic steps it up so things like this could happen a lot less.

* Building a wall or floor of your own to replace an enemey, hold button to edit (console), find player immediately, edit an opening and (place trap possibly and close him  in) ,and switch back to your weapon and potentially then only kill him. That takes skill and practice. 

THAT BEING SAID...I understand that was not the primary reason this happened since....that takes skill and practice and is mainly seen only at higher levels of gameplay....the main issue was very obvious....edit peeking and coming out last second to pop them with a perfectly lined shot, while you had vision, he had none, meanwhile you're theoretically behind a wall...

So i get it...

But when you're turtled as hell in a big fight in squads or something, sometimes you NEED to peek! You just have to....because you need to know where to escape and make a run for it and what side to sneak away. Or else you'll just make a door and eat a shotgun to the face.

Up until the v4.4 update, the game had never been more fun. With the addition of various map changes from the start of Season 4, to the awesome LTMs being added, it's safe to say that this game is one of the best ones of this day and age. (for the most part). 

I started playing a week or two after the Fortnitemares event began, right around the first of November. I immediately fell in love with the game, its basic concept, and most importantly its optimization. Around then I had a GTX 960 and a random intel chip and I was surprised that the game ran so well especially since it was Battle Royale, and because I had previously heard of the horrors surrounding PUBG and its optimization. Fast forward to the beginning of Season 2 and the game was starting to become the one we know of now. There was the first ever Battle Pass, awesome new skins/emotes, and new weapons/items. But towards the end of Season 2 and the start of Season 3, a never-ending pattern had begun that would still to this day affect Fortnite. Poor Optimization.

We get it that there's new lore that started with the meteor and now the rockets, and so it's understood that to maintain that hype that just keeps on growing, you have to release weekly updates. But man, my FPS and others' has been literally killing itself. I now have an i7-6600k, a GTX 1060, and 16gb of ram, and as every update finally comes out, I notice a loss of FPS of around 5-10. I don't know how console players feel about this topic, but I know that most PC players will agree with me when I say Quality over Quantity. The new items and weapons are cool, yeah, but myself and others would much prefer better optimization instead. I'm sure that much of the playerbase would be okay with you guys releasing updates a day ot two late, if it meant that the updates would be properly playtested and any performance issues resolved, and you could even extend the Battle Pass' end date to compensate for this. Just please, focus on performance rather than new items/weapons/features.

Problems such as the Memory Leaks from the V4.5 update which I know you guys are addressing, after the fact, could've been avoided if you guys had playtested the update first.

TL:DR The game's performance and optimization has slowly been worsening since the end of season 2 so, Epic, please focus on the quality of gameplay in terms of performance rather than adding new items, weapons, and features to the game.

p.s. I love this game and their developers and I mean nothing rude. Not trying to hate on anything or anyone, I just wanted to share my thoughts that I have been meaning to share since the middle of S3.

Well, I think for those who have leveled up their Battle-pass all the way, they should be able to do the same thing but for levels. 

I understand that those who have spent a lot of time grinding out the levels might not like that but hear me out. Imagine this, you have a job or school and get only about three hours each day and you manage to reach level 66, and you don't have enough time to fully upgrade Omega. That's a pretty bad feeling that you're only off by 14 levels.

Here's where buying levels comes into play. Now, I understand that some might also think this scummy because you could pay to level up when others have taken much more time than you have to grind it out but hear me out yet again. You can already buy battle pass tiers, and in doing so at the beginning of the season you get a few benefits. 

*Firstly*, if you buy all of the tiers then you get the XP bonus which would allow you to obtain a higher level.

*Secondly*, if you buy all of the tiers your weekly challenges will give you XP instead of stars, and a good bit of XP as well. If you do all of the weekly challenges you will get 50,000 XP, and in addition to this you will have the ability to gain an additional 70,000 XP from daily challenges. And if we go to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CkGH4AoireMrVs_x9MZp2p8NTXjZqV8oZqD5mnYUGnM/edit#gid=0) we can see that this amount of XP would get you to level 46, and that's just in challenges, not even including the XP you would get from the kills and wins.

I honestly think its way to much to reach level 80, I mostly play solos, and if im lucky I can play with friends that give xp boost, but even that is a joke, I average between 2-5 wins a day which give 300Xp per win, but thats really pss all in the grand scheme of things.. I missed around 3 weeks of fortnite due to work and holidays this season, and thats a big dent of reaching level 80.

I honestly  think I could reach level 80 in 14 days  (currently  level 68) but honestly I would have to play around 6-8 hours a day constantly (Its like Epic wants us to not have a life outside of the game) 
the 5K xp you get from completing Weekly challenges isnt much either...

I get how its meant to be a challenge and I like that only a few can be ''selected'' to unlock everything, but its honestly wayyy too much to my liking, it Promotes a UNHEALTHY Lifestyle when your sitting in a really bad posture staring at a bright light.. (And dont kid yourself, like 99% of gamers have bad sitting posture)

its easy as hell to spot hardcore gamers IRL with their neck and back problems lol...

IDK
whats your thought about high amount XP grinding? do you think they should lower the cap for next season. 
because now I have to put in hours upon hours each day for the last 14 days... I average a level a day..",FortNiteBR

That being said, I have growing concerns about this game. One of them is the Playground mode. It says [here](https://status.epicgames.com) that the mode is fixed, but they’re keeping it removed with no reason as to why. I’d be willing to bet that if there was an issue with the item shop or anything similar, it’d be fixed immediately. I am afraid of the devs only caring about money in the future. My main concern is that this game will become so casual friendly that it pushes experienced players out. Look at building. Building sets this game apart from other shooters, and is by far the biggest skill cap in this game. They’re nerfing it undoubtedly to push more camping styles and to help beginners join. That’s great, causuals should have fun also! It just should not come at the expense of others. I’m afraid if this game dying, and honestly I don’t know how much more is left in this game.

If i am being completely honest its mostly hate. But can I be blamed? 

Lets start with the aim system in this game. BLOOM which is an aim system that makes the weapon have random recoil patterns, which means you cannot learn the recoil patterns. Therefor, making the game a luck based game. This system is based around new players, making them like the game because they can essentially outgun a ""pro"" player all based on luck of the weapon pattern that is BLOOM. For all shooter games, this system is fundamentally flawed, and is normally not used for the games weapons mechanics, it is the worst system to use in a game.

Another reason, I dislike what the creators are doing, they are essentially  ignoring the main based core mechanics of a game, and just adding ""skins"" and ""emotes"" to try to shift the focus of the issues of the game mechanics. But they are not the main people to be blamed, the community is another key component for the issue of this game. The community is soaking up the new skins and emotes the developers drop, and are ignoring the real issues of the game. Which can lead the game to its own grave.

**SOLUTION:** Put up a new weapons mechanic for aiming, this will make new players have to learn the new system and will benefit people that put the time into learning the aim system. Making the aim system pretty easy to learn will still attract new players, and will make older players still happy because they have to use strategy to defeat their opponents.   ",FortNiteBR

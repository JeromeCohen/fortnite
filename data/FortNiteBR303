I'm an OG Fortnite player.  Downloaded the game the day it came out, fell in love, and never went back to my old games.  

Fact 1:. Back in the early days of Fortnite BR (July, August, September etc...) this subreddit was in love with the game and Epic.  There wasn't a complaint on this board.  In fact, it was often too gushy over the game and Epic.

Fact 2:. Back in the early days of Fortnite build offs and the building meta wasn't a thing...and players were in love with the game.

Fact 3:. Fortnite saw the most growth and love from fans BEFORE THE BUILDING META DEVELOPED.

So please, enough of this doom and gloom saying Fortnite will die if Epic messes with building.  Anyone who says that doesn't seem too bright in my opinion.",FortNiteBR

I just wanted to throw my hat into the ring and give my thoughts on some things about the hop-rocks and meteors and how they possibly link to relatively new skins.

So recently we have seen trucks carrying hop-rocks being escorted by black cars with a mysterious logo on them.

Well that logo is not so mysterious. I can give the origin of the logo and the name of the company. 

So people may or may not have noticed that the logo looks like a vbuck with the circular shape and 3 gaps on it. Well thats because its the company logo for vindertech. Vindertech is the name of the people who made the venturion skins, the jetpack and the vbuck itself. 

In save the world vindertech plays a much more important part in the story. Vindertech also makes,get this, ROCKETS.

In the opening level to save the world you have to launch a rocket. It looks almost identical to the fortnite battle royale one. You may think the rocket is some kind of nuke but it is actually a radar.

After completion of every zone in save the world you have to launch a new radar rocket to uncover the next zone. Maybe this rocket is used to uncover a new map.

All of this fits together really well and vindertech have had a bit more of an influence on the br side of the game recently. 

Hope this helps

I haven't played any other game since it released nearly a year ago.  I'm also pretty good at it with a 2.5 KD ratio and 20% win rate in solos.

However, I don't think the game is perfect and I personally enjoy hearing Epic attempt to address what I feel the games biggest shortcomings are.  I currently feel there are two major problems with Fortnite.

1.  The end game and running into quality players has gotten incredibly stale.  Build offs were fun for a few months but they've gotten less fun as times worn on.  I would prefer if we saw variety in taking out good players.  The current meta is indeed stale.

2.  I've tried to get a few of my friends into Fortnite to no avail.  Why?  In the few playsessions we've had they get steamrolled non stop.  They've probably put in over 5 hours into the game and a few of them have yet to record a single kill.  That's terrible IMO.

So I'd like to hear from a few people who have opinions that aren't just ""They're making it for noobs!"".  Please leave your downvoting elsewhere.  Come here to discuss the future of Fortnite in a positive way.

Hello I want to make a post with a few ideas on how to balance Fortnite at the current state that it is in. Most of my ideas revolve around gun play so not much will be said about building.

# Shotguns:

The first topic will be the shotguns. The shotgun nerf introduced right before 4.4 came out was a good start to the balancing of the Pump/Tactical shotguns. This nerf did cause a massive problem to arise in the use of the ""double pump"" strategy or the ""Pump Tac"" strategy. Even the ""Double heavy"" has arisen as a problematic meta. All of the strategies are things that fortnite should have removed not nerfed around. With the recent updates to the Suppressed SMG and the Minigun we have seen Fortnite attempt to push the use of other weapons into the meta of  the game. The goal is to make every weapon viable in any slot of the players inventory, but with this they have made 2/5 slots reserved for shotguns. Which leaves only 3 slots to use for Snipers, Assault Rifles, Sub Machine Guns, Machine Guns, Pistols, Grenades, Heals, Shields, and Utilities. The two shotgun strategy is killing weapon variety within the game because everyone feels the need to run two shotguns. With that being said the shotguns pull out time has to be significantly increased or you cannot carry two shotguns. 

# Tactical SMG:

The second topic is just a weapon balance for one of the guns, it will be short and sweet. The tactical Sub Machine Gun is one of the most broken weapons of all time. It is creeping into the meta slowly as everyone realizes that it is exceptionally good. The weapon does 16 damage in it's lowest variant (Uncommon) and 18 damage in it's highest variant (Epic). While doing that amount of damage it has one of the highest fire rates in the game of 13.0. Now after hearing this you would assume the weapon has a small magazine to compensate for the shredding the weapon is capable of, but it has the exact opposite. the magazine size is 35. If you were to hit every shot with an epic variant of this weapon you could kill 3 fully shielded opponents, this includes no head shots. You are only requires to hit 12 of your shots to the body, once again including zero head shots to kill somebody with 100 health and 100 shield.. The weapons magazine size or fire rate needs a nerf in some way.

# Pistols:

The third topic is the Pistol bloom(This excludes the hand cannon). The pistol bloom is too large to compensate for. The weapon is balanced damage and fire rate wise, but after the first shot even within a room it struggles to hit the wide side of a barn. This goes for Pistols from the lowest variant (Pistol - Common) to the highest variant (Suppressed pistol - Legendary). Nothing more has to be touched except the bloom. Reducing it by a third or a fourth of what it is now would sufficient in my opinion.

# Rocket Launcher + Supply Drops:

The last topic that comes to mind is making the Rocket Launcher a crate only weapon and possibly nerfing the splash damage done to players off of the explosion.. This is a good idea for a few reasons.

1. Removes being rocketed in the beginning of the game when materials are scarce.
2. Brings players towards Supply Drops making more quality gun fights.
3. Makes Supply Drops worth going for.
4. Reduces the Rocket Spam problem that fortnite currently has.

Also with supply drops the Hand Cannon should be removed from them.

# Conclusion:

Comment with any ideas you have or if you have anything to say about what i think would be good balancing. I'd love to hear and discuss some opinions on this.",FortNiteBR

Yes building is a core element and yes you should get to build. But you shouldn't always have to rely on your 1x1 and your shotgun. You should be able to run a loadout without a shotgun. You should be able to take a silenced smg instead of a shotgun and still be able to win a fight. Some battles should be gun battles not build battles. Remember back in the day when no one built? Epic didn't need to nerf mats because everyone didn't know how to build. But now that people are leaning towards the building side of the scale Epic might need to put some more weight on the shooting side of the scale. It should be ""Perfectly Balanced"". So try running different combos of guns. I mean I don't think anyone has ever run a burst assault with a suppressed smg, grenades, a RPG, and bandages. Switch it up.

I think it's safe to say that a lot of players are upset by Epic's recent changes to the meta of the game. Shotguns and building - two core components of the game's current meta - have been nerfed quite a bit. However, these changes may be more positive to the game's growth than you'd expect.

First off, shotguns. Of the six weapon types, they are easily the most prominent and necessary in this game. No weapon outclasses shotguns in CQC because they deal lots of damage in bursts, allowing for quick and easy kills as long as your elevation and aim are both decent. (Mostly the latter, but regardlessly)

In my opinion, the shotgun nerf is a great thing. The FortniteBR subreddit loves to overexaggerate; when this nerf happened, plenty of people were content, but MANY were extremely upset as well. Epic still has plans to change shotguns to decrease their prominence in the game, and to me, that's fine.

Of the six weapon types, two are extremely dominant in-game (Shotguns and Assault Rifles), one is relatively skill-based (Snipers), two are severely underused (Machine Guns and Pistols, although the former has become more popular recently), and one is a low-skill weapon to use (Explosives). Epic's desire is clearly to create a common usefulness amongst these six weapon types, so that all of them are viable in battle. When's the last time you chose an SMG over a shotgun? Or a Deagle over an AR? Some people may do this for fun or to practice different weapon types, but very few do it seriously. Shotguns' utility makes them rampant amongst our meta and as a result makes other guns sit in its shadow.

As for the building nerf, we can all complain and overexaggerate (it happens with every change Epic makes on this sub), but it's a beneficial change. Epic obviously wants building to remain important for the game, but they want building to reflect people's skill level as well. Rushing opponents does not make you good; it makes you aggressive, which some people correlate with skill, but it is not always a good thing. Rushing requires good medical stats and a plan, and some players choose to rush opponents spamming stairs and walls until they get their necessary shotgun shot off to kill them. A smart player in this future changed meta would use their reduced materials cautiously, knowing which fights require a push and which fights can be a bit more mid/long-range. This is likely why Epic is introducing this future LTM; they want to see if players choose to be smart in how they manage their materials, or continue to be recklessly aggressive with them.

Many of you will disagree (Oh, but this will just encourage turtling! / This makes the game boring!), but if Fortnite really becomes stale because you don't like a more passive meta, then just farm as much as you can and continue to rush anyway. Notice that players usually resort to turtling when they get shot at; maybe try to get closer to your opponent to shoot them so you have a higher chance of hitting your shots and preventing a passive fight. It's all up to you guys on how to play, and the meta is going to show who can really adapt and play smart and who can't.

If you made it here, thanks for your attention. I hope you can respond maturely in the comments and we can discuss.

TL;DR: Shotguns are too prominent and this desired change by Epic allows other guns to have more relevance and viability. Building nerfs exist to teach players that rushing recklessly and constantly is not the only way to play, and that materials must be managed cautiously. This may become the birth of another skill gap between players as well.",FortNiteBR

--- This seems like an unpopular opinion. (It definitely used to be - search ""skill based match msking"" in this sub...approx 4 months ago...) ----

I am not sure if this is an option, but instead of nerfing core building mechanics to appease to new players, please instead consider bringing out a Ranked and Casual game option. Each iteration has all the same game modes. (Solos, squads, LTMs, etc).

In *Ranked* you play opponents of similar skill; meaning noobs go mostly against other noobs whereas pros mostly go up against pros. 

If you don't like that, fine - that's what the *casual* option is for which changes nothing compared to how it is now. Everybody - of all skill level - plays together.

This way New comers have a better chance and pros get better practice. And if one wishes, just play casual just like it is now.

\-In order to get outta the shotgun meta, others guns need to reward skills besides luck.

I'm absolutely loving tuning in to the tournament each week even with me residing in Europe so it runs into the early hours of the morning. The most interesting and tense games are the ones where the kills are ridiculously close coming to the end of the game, it would only add to this if the kill count was implemented as below. With it showing this way we can all keep track of the kills for each team ourselves rather than every 10 minutes or so the streamer adding the kills up as quickly as possible which sometimes results in incorrect calculations.

I know this has been suggested before and probably multiple times, however I think there is no more fitting time to bring it back to Epics attention. Fortnite doesn't necessarily lend itself easily to being an esport or spectator sport, it's easy to miss action with it taking place sparsely across the map and multiple members of the team fighting at the same time, I think any easy implementations to heighten the viewer experience is a huge win for all involved.

Specifically they wanted the botlane duo roles to consist of more than just the classic duo of AD Carry and Support.

In fact, Riot decided that they wanted players to be able to essentially play any champion in any role. The community did not ask for this. This changes the core aspect of the metagame defined by certain roles being played in certain lanes. 

This led to a huge falloff both in fun, and eventually the player base, and as described by a pro player is due to a huge falloff in fun. As is explained by TL doublelift, sometimes a company may have a good idea, but the execution leads to the game being far less fun overall. There is no need to make drastic changes that are not necessary.

Look at the comments. Sounds eerily similar to what we are seeing here. Just a month or two after the fact is all.

I personally don‚Äôt like the mat nerfs. C4s are the most overpowered counterplay in this game. I do indeed peek shot my ass off. Crossbow me to a tree in Wailing Woods for saying this, but I use turbo farming as well. After I get a shotgun (or two) and an AR, I farm max wood before leaving any drop location because the chances of running into people with low materials post-death is increasing every game. Absolutely, early game is more FUN dropping Tilted every time, but I play to focus on improving building and editing while also trying to win. Most games, by the time of first circle beginning to close in (on NA East, can‚Äôt speak for anyone else) have 40 or less players left, and there‚Äôs tons of downtime in between fights. 


I play primarily squads for the increased pace and to play with friends to help them improve, my duo partner has went MIA recently, and my girlfriend has been trying to improve both accuracy and building habits while playing PS4 with us on PC, and it‚Äôs considerably more tedious trying to learn that in duos with me than it is by herself on console.

The new fortnite update is good for the game (shotgun and building nerf). Here's why:

I'm sure everyone agrees that there is an inherent problem with gun balance in a game, if roughly 70&amp;#37; or even more of total kills are made with one weapon type (shotguns). The meta is all about getting up close, building, and shotgun fights. That is fine in itself, but the reasons for this meta are questionable: 1. mid range and long range combat often ends in two or more players being stuck at distance without being able to kill each other due to building. The only solution to proceed is to close the gap, and engage in a building shotgun fight. So little viability is not good for a game. 2. The game doesn't punish bad positioning enough, due to instant building. One can stupidly run in an open field, asking to be killed, but in fortnite, that is not a concern. Positioning is mostly only a concern in close quarter and building fights. Once again, the meta is forced to this. 3. The meta is all about shotguns shotguns shotguns, but the weapon hitreg is broken, which they said they aim to fix soon. I could go on, but in summary, THERE IS ONLY 1 VIABLE RANGE, AND ONE VIABLE GUN TYPE. That needs to be changed (without ruining that completely, I agree).

The update should shift the meta (1) slightly away from only one gun type to dominate, and give room to mid range combat, and (2)countering building (minigun buff and fewer mats etc.). is now a more effective strategy, meaning clever positioning is more rewarded. Overall, both tracking aim, and other valuable skill fields such as positioning, are more rewarded now, rising the skill ceiling, rather than lowering it, even if the gap between excellent builders and decent ones is lowered (learning building took us enthusiasts about 3 months, good aim with other strategical qualities of shooters take a lifetime).

All this does not mean the game doesn't have shotguns and building anymore. It's just more balanced with other viable options and strategies now. This is an excellent and really thought through balance update for the game. For the first time the devs are not just simply seeing where the game is going, they are balancing it, which is what the balance team is for.

If they manage to introduce more strategies that are as viable as close quarter combat strats, this game is heading in the right direction, especially bc. they aim to go competitive. One never changing meta, close quarter building, itself isn't enough to separate the best from the insanely good after a year of competitive play.

If you disagree, please explain why. One pumping was fun  is not a good reason to argue against this balance update since this game aims to go competitive.

Today, I logged in for the first time to play with a friend and my account was level 54. A guy from Russia has been playing on it for god knows how long, even changed my password ( I didn't noticed because I log in with facebook everytime and my facebook e-mail/account are different from my main e-mail so I never really check it).

I am very careful when it comes to the internet and since, like I said, I had to study, I haven't really had the chance to use anything else besides youtube and facebook.

None of my friends has any of my passwords, I never give any personal info to anyone.

I'm trying to figure out how did that happen. I changed my account info back to english and resetted my password. The account e-mail was fine and my facebook is fine too so the guy only had access to the epic games account.

Besides turning on the two steps log in, what can I do to prevent this from ever happening again?

Has this ever happened to anyone in here?",FortNiteBR

In the video I can remember the kid talking about how he tried hard to get good grades in school and just having this awesome chat with the streamer, so the streamer added the kid and played 2 games with him to get him a win. Really been trying to find this video again since it's so entertaining and funny.

Obviously the community got mad and had an outburst.

This is an reasonable response as we had no idea why Epic would do this! We thought they were trying to get rid of building, a key element of this game.

But earlier yesterday, a redditor had an popular post explaining why Epic would add an resource cap.    ((It explained that it would reduce farming due to differences players could have in material numbers. Previous it was 0 - 1500 while resource cap could put it to 0 - 750 or whatever))

Suddenly, the community calmed down, all because they had an reasonable reason. 

See Epic, this is why we need you to start explaining your changes, at first it may seem like the worst idea in the world but after some answers it could seem actually smart. For the love of God, please start doing developer comments as the community will calm down and there will no longer be an relationship with the community in which they hate the developer.

(You may disagree will resource caps but the point still stands)

TL;DR
 Resource caps seems stupid at first due to no explanation. After some explaining from an redditor, the community calmed down and the idea of resource caps seems like an good idea.

The negative first: I don't think it should be a legendary skin, it should be a rare to epic one.

A little story:

We played a few days ago and [came to the topic of the swastika if you build 4 metal floors with the 1/4 edit in a circle](https://i.imgur.com/uCy3nWj.png). We tried that and it still worked. One of us said that there is a skin coming which looks like a WWI/WWII soldier.

The others and me didn't really remember what he looked like so we took a look at the leaked pics and agreed with him.

When the skin was released we bought it and mostly spoke this typical ww2 german we all know from the movies. This over the top pronouncing.

Since this season is about super heros we gave him the name 'Gestapo Man'.

Sorry epic, but releasing a skin a few days after the 'Swastika Incident' it's just a way to good template for thoughts like this.

We still had so much fun! There were so many funny moments like [this](https://youtu.be/dbV189oGMVU).

Don't get this wrong. Don't be to sensitive. It's not about celebrating any kind of ideology or racism. We didn't cross the line to bad taste. I did the same with Rust Lord, who is clearly Star Lord from Guardian of the Galaxy. There were a lot of quotes and lines used from the movie ingame.

Pretty decent, imo. This AFK method helps because I hated having to play the game way more than I wanted to which was quite stressful.

My Method: 

1. Go in to solos.

2. Jump out of the bus once it reaches the middle of the map, immediately pull your glider. 

3. Wait the ~1:20 until the bus leaves and the first circle appears. 

4. Go to the first circle then hide in a bush. You will be able to make it to top 10 without moving and receive that 744 XP for doing absolutely nothing. *Make sure you make it to top 10* 

I‚Äôve been doing this over and over from R-Play (paid, third party remote-play app for iPhone) on my phone. I could probably do this more often if I had mobile but unfortunately my phone isn‚Äôt compatible.

Note: 

- If you care about your KDR this AFK method isn‚Äôt for you.

- Kills only give you minimum 6 XP but 50 for getting one period.

- If you are level 63, with 17 days left in the season, this should be a breeze with only one level to do every day.",FortNiteBR

Give us a feature where the analog deadzones implent sprinting at maximum range. There's already a huge gap on the outer edge . So it will be sneak, walk, jog, then Sprint. 


On a side note walking in this game is practically irrelevant. You can hear footsteps across the map also I haven't seen any tightropes in the game where I need precision.


Also a bonus suggestion. Getting caught in the storm. It happens to the best of us . Running in the storm with no meds and you can't make it due to not paying attention, being ambushed whatever the reason.

Last night I came up with the idea (sorry in advance if this has been suggested already) where there would be four different busses, and each squad member is on a different bus. The busses wouldn‚Äôt intersect, and they would be short paths across the corners of the map. Your squad would all have to land in different locations (unless they chose to glide to each other). 
The circle wouldn‚Äôt be centered to the middle of the map, it would appear in random locations as it does in normal game modes. The squad would have to deal with other one on ones without the stress of facing a whole squad alone at the beginning of the game. 
I understand that some may be opposed to this idea, but I feel like there could be many different strategies used, and create intense fights towards the end of the game, since at the beginning, players can‚Äôt rely on squad mates to carry them through the game.

in the S4 cinematic, we see the rustlord watching a movie 
(‚ÄúFrom the darkest depths of deep space! Mystery is on a collision course with danger!‚Äù)
In the movie, a ship flies out from earth and onto somewhere else‚Äî Found to be mars, after the full movie was datamined (can‚Äôt find it but remember seeing it). 

Now, as you all know, The Visitor (Blockbuster) is *not* an actor. He came from inside the meteor that hit dusty, Which was not a prop, according to the W6 loading screen directors notes. We know he came from the meteor from the W7 loading screen, showing him dazed after initially leaving his capsule.

There‚Äôs a hole in the ‚ÄúMeteor room‚Äù at dusty,  On the side facing the missle base- Foreshadowing him in it, in the 8th blockbuster award loading screen.

In this reward screen, Visitor is programming something, the missle, inferibly, since well *i don‚Äôt even have to elaborate since what the fuck else*

Anyways, He‚Äôs programming the missle to go back home. Back to mars- The location of the new map.

This map will likely be added tuesday, the day patch 4.5 releases. the .5 updates tend to be the big ones: 2.5 with the Tilted / Shifty etc. update, 3.5 with replays and balances, 4.5 with... A new map?

More considerable evidence is that in the leaked 4.5 Athena (normal current) map, the missle is not in the silo- But, There is not apparent impact site anywhere on the map. So where did it go?

also all patches have been on a tuesday so badabingbadaboom

This seems a bit far fetched, but Epic has hinted at working on a new map, and they can‚Äôt keep destroying this map and over saturating it with locations.

But I also believe that it's broken and can't be countered.
Sure you can ""just build lol"" but you're eventually gonna run out of mats (especially early game since its easy to find pumps and you have little to no mats). It also ruins the weapon balance, the tactical shotgun is supposed to be a fast shotgun with slightly less damage while the pump is a slower more deadly one, by eliminating the cool down thanks to double pump, it makes the tactical completely irrelevant. The pump is supposed to be a shotgun for skilled players that can aim, not an easily exploited weapon. Unless you double pump or just really skilled or lucky, don't expect to hold compete with people who double pump.

This is only my opinion tough, I'm still having fun with the game.

I do agree that building is the best way to win a 1v1 and other strats should be capable of competing with it but nerfing building would just be a huge slap in the face to skilled players who spent countless hours on this game trying to get better. I don‚Äôt like anything that lowers the skill gap because I believe that the extremely skilled players should be able to dominate. You can‚Äôt come into something without practice and expect to beat a skilled player. On the other hand though, I believe that other strats should compete with building. A variation of strategies would be healthy for a game‚Äôs longevity, so I have a couple of suggestions:
- Removing bloom and adding recoil would widen the skill gap in gunplay. Players skilled in aim would dominate in gunfights. This would also make the SMG more appealing in close range gunfights.
- Allowing bullet penetration would be a small counter to building. Different building materials would allow for more/less penetration damage. Different weapons would be more/less effective at shooting through structures.
- Adding a ranked playlist would give newcomers a chance to learn and enjoy the game without getting absolutely demolished by a skull trooper. Newcomers would uninstall if they get destroyed every game.


I really love Fortnite and this building nerf would really be a game changer for me. Building is what makes this game unique and quite frankly one of the only things in this game that is skill-based. So my solution is to make more aspects of the game skill-based instead of luck-based. 
Don‚Äôt nerf building but just make everything else better

So as the title says, I‚Äôve had an idea on how to balance the overwhelming shotgun meta Epic has been trying to rework these last couple of weeks. After Epic implemented the explosive ammo nerf by capping how many you can carry, I had the idea of why not doing the same thing for shotguns? No I‚Äôm not talking about shotgun ammo, but rather, only allowing players to pick up one shotgun at a time. This seems like a better fix than a weapon swap delay. I remember when double pump first came out, and most of the big streamers refused to use it at first because many considered it broken. And as time went on and it became more popular, they began using it to show Epic how broken it was in order to fix it. And ever since then we have been in this double shotgun meta of the game. With a little bit of play testing, perhaps they could bring back one pumping. Hard to say, we would have to see how the game shifts with the change before tweaking damage numbers I think. But I think it would be a better direction for Epic to take than just the building nerf they have been doing. Either way we all love this game and we will adapt to whatever changes Epic makes.

It will just force the building beasts to keep their materials longer as they can only keep 1500 at once (Metal and brick are so rare most wouldn't even crack 900 total). The result of this: People rushing you third party style would have less mats to completely overpower you while your health and materials are low. Also, it could fix the ''20 players left before the first circle closed'' problem, as people would go more to Wailing/Haunted/Fatal/Moisty to gather mats and would be slightly less aggressive without the ridiculous amount of mats. In addition to this, buffing utility grenades like C4s and getting clingers in the game help to create a strat to counter over building if you're low on mats after a fight. I have 5000 games played and a KD around 2 so I'm not the best player nor the worst, but the game right now is very depressing for new players (Some of my friends hopped off because they were new and getting crushed). Also, people saying building is the only skill part of the game lol you're so wrong. Being smart on your positionning (Taking mountains in end game), making headshots (Bloom yeah, but I have friends that are way better at hitting headshots than I am. Sometimes you're gonna get screwed, but if you're really good, you should win 90% of your AR fights because you know how to handle the sensitivity), knowing where to land to maximize your skill, etc. I think the building got a little bit out of hand for what the game was supposed to be, and Epic will make the changes according to it. Building is still the biggest skillgap in the game and people who are gods at building will still be the best, but not only because of that aspect. To finish, the thing that made this game so popular was it's diversity in items, in strategies and the environment that made the game just fun and less stressful (I used to play Fifa and NHL and I would always rage whereas Fortnite I very rarely get pissed). The game was already very popular before the true building Meta started (I'd say it was around January/February Ninja/Myth really mastered it and people started wanting to imitate them).",FortNiteBR

Shotguns - I don't actually think they're a problem. Double pumping is an awful lot of fun if you just spend a little bit of time learning it. Build fights inherently mean shotguns will be essential, as you're in close quarters. Do people really want more sniper/AR spam battles? 

I honestly don't see a biased in the meta right now. Shotguns play their part - close quaters, AR medium range and snipers long range. I literally use all of them for their purpose and have no problem with it. Sure, in a 1v1 towards the end I use the shotgun the most but that's because its an effin shotgun!!? Why shouldn't a shotgun be used for close quarters.

Other strategies - People are also arguing there should be other strats. Sure, but there already is. If you want to, camp, if you want to be aggresive. C4 is OP rn, if you want to use it use it. Turtling is now even easier to punish than ever before. 

Building - FAST PACE BUILDING IS FUN! If there has to be a cap, then a material gain increase will definitely be needed in my opinion. But building is central to the game, and that thrill of having a build fight for higher ground and finally achieving it and then getting an edge on your opponent is great. It'd feel kind of bland to get a high grind and just wait around for a while scared to use anymore resources.

Just my opinion, not looking to argue! Just thought I'd put it out there :)",FortNiteBR

Since Overwolf just disabled the one I was using, I needed to find another way. Now I'll share that method with you guys.

Disclaimers: -Static crosshair only

\-PC only

\- Must run Fortnite in windowed mode

Step 1:    [Download Custom Desktop Logo.](http://customdesktoplogo.wikidot.com/download)

Step 2:    Find yourself a picture of a crosshair you like that is centered and has a transparent background. Mine is the image for this post, or you can download it [here](https://pasteboard.co/Hr0rvkT.png). Save this image in a location you can remember.

Step 3:    Unzip Custom Desktop Logo to a place you can remember. You can make a shortcut for the ""CustomDesktopLogo.exe"" to desktop, taskbar, etc. to make it easier to launch.

Step 4:    Launch Custom Desktop Logo by double clicking the ""CustomDesktopLogo.exe"" application file in the folder from the previous step. You will probably see a logo appear in the bottom right of your screen.

Step 5:    In the system tray (bottom right of your screen) you should see an icon for Custom Desktop Logo. Right click the Icon and select ""Settings""

Step 6:    Click the ""Change Image Folder"". Navigate and select the folder from Step 2. You should see your crosshair appear on-screen at this point.

Step 7:    Select the ""Location"" tab at the top of the settings window. Under ""Display Location"" select ""Centre"". For my crosshair I had to set ""Location Offset"" Y value to -1 to center it on my Fortnite crosshair. Then Select the ""Size"" tab at the top and adjust the size of the crosshair to your liking. The size for my crosshair is 1.

Step 8:    Launch Fortnite and start a game. Get to the ground so you can see your in-game crosshair. Adjust the X and Y values for ""Location Offset"" in the ""Location"" tab of the Custom Desktop Logo settings window until your new crosshair lines up with the default Fortnite crosshair.

Step 9:    Once your new crosshair is centered, minimize (closing it will also make the crosshair disappear) the Custom Desktop Logo settings window.

\*This step must be done in a match for some reason.\*

Step 10:    Go to your settings menu in Fortnite and go to the tab with the gear icon. Select the HUD tab within this menu. turn off the crosshair from here.

Step 11: Enjoy. :)

Seems like too many steps, but I'm not experienced in making guides. Sorry if it's hard to read.

P.S. Really not sure if Creative is the correct flair, but it seemed like the least incorrect.

The end game is arguably the most exciting and fun part of a match in fortnite. But, as shown by every match ever, rockets (Grenade + Rocket Launcher) and shotguns dominate the end game. And personally, I hate this.

Epic is constantly adding new items such as the stink bomb, which recently was added. Personally, I love the stink bomb, but I have a huge issue with it.  When it comes to the choice of stink bombs or rockets/shotguns, I will almost always choose rockets because of the stronger power of them. And that's what's wrong with this game right now. Even though Epic constantly adds new trinkets, they are never used however much we want to because of dominating weapons that already exist. 

I just want rockets and shotguns to become less useful so the game can have more variety involved and rather than rocket spamming, we can show more skill with different weapons and traps.

As I‚Äôm sure many people will agree, building is the core aspect of Fortnite and it‚Äôs this very unique feature that thrives the game. It‚Äôs obvious in which direction you guys are going with the recent changes to material gain.

I can assure you that the majority of the player base isn‚Äôt here for a 3rd person battle royale with bloom and a cartoony feel to it. 

I‚Äôm afraid that further nerfing materials, or worse, introducing a lower resource cap will only hurt your game in the long run.

You‚Äôve mentioned that not every encounter should result in a build-off, is this such a bad thing? I personally thoroughly enjoy build-offs and it‚Äôs this very apsect that makes me want to jump into games and enjoy the quick paced strategic action in which they result. As I‚Äôm sure many will agree.

As a graduate in business marketing I get why set changes are being made, a large portion of your target group are children. I can see how 12 year old kids aren‚Äôt capable of participating in build-offs, as the hectic environment calls for quick and effective decision making, a skill which might be lacking at that age.
This could indeed cause them to get eliminated more often resulting in a less enjoyable gaming experience. Whereupon an obvious reduction in play time occurs, some might even quit, which ultimately leads to less money in your pockets. We get it.

**Suggestion**
If you really wish to present viewer difficulties in the overall gaming experience, to attract the discused target group consider the following:

- Keep updating the main version of the game to satisfy the needs of this section of your playerbase.
(Guides missiles, jetpacks, hoprocks, whatever)

- Have a seperate version of the game, maybe in the form of a permanent mode. That pays particular attention to maintaining the aspects we all love: The fast paced, smooth and strategic gameplay. With a lot of resources available so that building as we know and love continues to thrive. 

In this case you‚Äôll have best of two worlds by continuing to satisfy your entire fan base.

I‚Äôm sorry (not sorry) for the long post, I felt like some constructive criticism was in place to prevent the game we all learned to love from hurting itself by making the wrong changes.

TL;DR, please read the entire post.

It's gotten pretty ridiculous how quick people are to finish downed players. I've heard people argue that they do it to prevent the downed player communicating their position to their team or that they need the downed players weapons/ammo/materials but I suspect most people do it just because it's been done to them. 

I've seen people finish downed players while they themselves are currently being shot at, downed players who have absolutely nothing(enemy player beat them to the starting weapons), and downed players just because they want to drag some players down with them. It's all pretty toxic.

Player behavior isn't going to be changed at this point so something has to be changed with how the downed state is handled. Even a brief 10-15 second period of invincibility for the downed player would go a long way. At the end of the day when one of your friends, or yourself,  are knocked out of the rest of the match it's not fun for them/you. Epic removed friendly fire because it was ruining people's enjoyment of the game and the similar changes need to be made in regard to downed players.

TL;DR: Change something about the downed player state to make the game less toxic.

While these things are good, everybody has access to shotguns and by mid to late game, which is where epic says the problem is, everybody could carry rockets if they wanted. IMO they are in great shape right now.

The thing is epic still thinks they should be changed. What they don‚Äôt seem to understand is that as long as building is in the game shooting from a distance is not very effective. Players will just build to defend themselves so the only way to really kill someone is with a shotgun. If epic nerfs building we will just be in a spot where fights come down to who runs out of mats first and then just sprays down the enemy. 

So what should they do? As the title says I believe that epic should make ars less rng based or increase the range before damage fall off. The reason that building jut beats ars is that even if you get a shot through, rng might be mean to you or the shot does to little damage to matter. 

TL;DR: epic thinks that‚Äôs shotguns and rockets are op and nerfing building would stop that but buffing ars would give incentive for longer range fights. ",FortNiteBR

Sick idea, and it‚Äôs already a weapon in Save The World (trust me I own it).

If EPIC did add this to the game I feel like they would have to make its rarity rare or higher to not have everyone early game running around with one. To stop someone double pumping with the weapon epic could add a weapon delay when switching between SHOTGUNS only.

Remove the current delay on shotguns but implement a delay when switching between shotguns, this would mean that you‚Äôd be able to build and get a clean shot off quickly but would stop you from having the original double pump speed in favour of the current slow methodical double pump meta.

This would cater to a lot of different play styles 
People can run around with double pump and double heavy as normal (as long as their accuracy is on point) and others who favour the single shotgun meta can use a shotgun that can deal damage and be used quickly mid build battle. 

This then goes with Epics recent statement of catering to different playstyles by giving everyone a chance to use a shotgun how they feel most comfortable and enjoyable and also not ruin end game.

But if Epic tries to get away from aggressive play styles and building, the game will become extremely boring for a lot of people. If you're a passive player who likes to sit in a base and have a camping play style, you do you. But it's your job to know how to play and counter an aggressive player, the same way aggressive players have to counter other aggressive players. If you're dying in a game like Fortnite or any Battle Royal in general for that matter, 90% of the time you could have done something better (given that the other 10% of the time you died because of a glitch/exploit)

The building ""meta"" of Fortnite is what sets it to one side when compared to other BR's like PUBG as it's something extra to the game. The building doesn't take away from your shooting skill, it adds to it. It's something extra to learn. (Arguments about bloom are irrelevant if you want recoil added to the game, play 3rd person PUBG and you'll soon realize that it's the same as bloom, you just have to pull the reticle down on top of that)

Epic, on the other hand, is trying its best to reduce these build-offs by reducing the amount of materials we get (floor drops and llamas), so I am under the impression that they will be reducing the max material cap to 500 per mat. This will definitely change the game and move towards traditional fort building with mid-to-long-range fights and the occasional close range shotgun fight.

I think they should do this to appeal to more casual gamers, however, I don't think they should eliminate the 1000 mat cap altogether. I think the 500 mat cap should be applied to a casual mode where stats don't count and could appeal to those who don't play as much as others making the build-offs an inevitable loss for them. A ranked mode with 1000 mat cap would appeal to those who play Fortnite more competitively and enjoy rushing and are actually good at it. 

What this does is separates the noobs / casual players from those who spend more time with the game and love the idea of ranked gameplay. Any thoughts?",FortNiteBR

However overall the vast majority of the supporters to the material cap are people that don't build at an elite level. They don't want the changes because they actually think they will be good for the game, they want the changes so that they will be better at the game. People need to stop lying and masquerading behind false reasoning. 

Simply put:

If you are an elite builder you most likely don't want materials to get capped and the skill gap to be closed.

If you are average or below average at building then you want the materials to be capped and the skill gap to be closed.

So in conclusion the one thing that we can take from this is that.... we all are selfish.",FortNiteBR

Epic is trying to make things even.  They want to expand the player base.  Every encounter should not end in a build off, and the final circle shouldn't either.  There are going to be multiple strategies. 

Getting reaallll sick and tired of people talking like being a pro builder is the only way to have a legitimate win, it's not.  Get over it. 

They are making these changes for the better of the game, whether you like it or not.  They want to expand the player base, and the only way they do that is to scale things back a bit, let the novice players get into the game.  It's busines 101.

And I get it.  You all want your voice, you want to be heard.  And Epic has done a great job at listening but this is one thing I don't see coming back. 

Can we all just SHUT UP about materials.....It's not changing!",FortNiteBR

When you start to add story into a game that doesn‚Äôt need any, it just becomes weird. It‚Äôs like adding a story mode Into CoD: WWII. It‚Äôs pointless. I know they needed a way to ‚Äúget rid of tilted‚Äù if thats what they‚Äôre doing. A little off topic again but why do people think a ‚Äúcomet‚Äù (use that term loosely) would hit? A comet has never even actually come close to hitting us, so why do they think a comet would hit the BR world?

I've encountered instances of solo teaming 3 times the past 2 days and it is abundantly clear that reporting them in game does nothing.

These players absolutely ruin the solo experience and the worst part is they get away with it. When is EPIC going to do something about this instead of twiddling their fucking thumbs and making more cosmetics?

I suggest a temporary IP ban, because banning their PSN/Xbox accounts is pointless as they will just create another account. 90% of the solo teamers I come across have brand new accounts, you can tell because they have no PS trophies.

EPIC, please do something about this.

I also purchased Save the World for the vbucks and stuff but he makes fun of me for not spending them, because I've been waiting to buy the battle pass for s4 tomorrow so I don't have to spend more money on vbucks. I don't really want to spend much money on FortNite...

Look at the item shop, for the next 24 hours you can purchase 100 Stars for your battle pass, i'm guessing this means that we won't be seeing the update for another 24 hours. 

I find it really odd though that the in game counter for daily items has normally been the rotation for the battle pass to go down by a day, and last night it went down from 2 to 1 day left, but tonight it did not move anything.

I figure it might be because of the major server outage that happened a few weeks ago, but I still find it odd that we don't get any information regarding when Season 4 will hit.",FortNiteBR

I played this game when they were released but I wasn't sure if I wanted to invest money into the game because I was testing the waters.

Now, you still have a little more than one day to reach max tier. However, when it's getting close to being over, I advise you not to be cheap and potentially miss out on the John Wick skin. I know a lot of people would have gladly invested the 150 vbucks last season to get the Black Knight but thought they could make it without doing so.

I'm not trying to make Epic some money here, I just remember how it was last season. Also remember on tier 100 you unlock a few bonus challenges to unlock John Wicks glider which will also take you a few hours.",FortNiteBR

I was thrown in a game with a 12 year old who's playing since 3 weeks and hasn't gotten any wins so far. (At least in solo and duo, he said he had like 2 in squads)

I've always been someone who dislikes playing with 12 year olds, since they usually scream a lot for no real reason.

But he was a lot different, he didn't play well and didn't even know how to edit structures but overall he played well and made some nice calls. 
We ended up winning this game, I had to revive him like at least 5 times to the same sniper who kept shooting him down whenever he tried to heal (since he didn't box himself in whenever he was healing).

I've never carried someone in my whole life, usually it's me to be carried. I don't think I'm a good player, maybe slightly above average if all but it was nice to be the ""big brother"" at least once.

He was so thankful for the win and we ended up adding eachother. So to all the players out there who are like me and don't like playing with little kids: give them a chance. Sometimes they turn out to be half decent and there is nothing more heartwarming than a kid who doesn't stop thanking you for a win. 

It almost made me cry to see how happy he was.. 

This is not a post trying to brag or anything. I just wanted to share this story with you.

Peace",FortNiteBR

[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjYI6McxHZo)

His youtube channel is flooded with R.I.P messages, and his friend/relative has made a video confirming his passing, and as of right now it's looking like it might be true.


He might not be the type of youtuber this subreddit looks up to, but he's kind of a big name in the fortnite community, and if this is true, it's probably the first time something like this has happened in the community.


Sending prayers/respects to his family/friends.

I believe these phrases to be an indication of what to expect to arrive with season 4. That said, this is all opinion and I could very well be wrong, but bear with me.

**""Battle. Adapt. Win.""**
This, I believe, points to a changing battle ground which you need to adapt to. It could be related to the comet/meteor in some respect, perhaps areas on the map become under fire from meteorites not unlike the 'red zone' seen in other battle royale games.

**""Check every corner, box, and bush.""**
Those who have also enjoyed the flip side to BR that is Save the World know that you can search almost every container and plant in the game. I think it's obvious that we're going to be allowed to do so in Season 4 - a good source of materials or ammo. Maybe a lucky gun if you're lucky.

**""Leave your mark.""**
I believe this points to tagging coming in Season 4, tagging is a pretty common thing in most online shooters so it wouldn't surprise me to see it come to Fortnite BR.

**""Fight with Honor.""**
I left this for last because it is the least simple to draw a conclusion of. My gut tells me it could be related to some form of melee combat, often seen as honourable.

What do you think of these conclusions, are Epic teasing us of what is to come or am I just seeing what I want?

I played a game today where I came in second. The person who won shot over 63 grenades at me. That means that they had at least 63 rockets in their inventory. I guess there isn't a cap on ammo for it like with other weapons.

So what is the best way to play around this? In this scenario, the opponent had high ground on me because I took out the players and then they knocked my 1X1 down. I was trying to turtle until they ran out of ammo, but it just kept coming. I've lost due to a rocket flying (glitching) through my wall before, so I didn't want to try to box myself in and keep rebuilding when they destroy my walls. How do you successfully deal with this kind of situation?

Just pushing would have been really difficult, and I was trying to heal since I took some damage from the previous fights and had full heals. I know that some high level players have said that this is a good way to deal with the grenade launcher and I feel like it was probably my best bet, but I just wasn't expecting them to have so many rockets.

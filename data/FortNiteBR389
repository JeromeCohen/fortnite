First of all, I strongly disagree with the idea of there being keyboard/mouse support for this game (or any competitive game) on console, but I wanted to try it anyway to see if I could play as well as I can on PC. As it happens, I could not, due to shoddy implementation. Quick rundown:

- The mouse cursor was invisible and nothing I did could restore it. This made navigating menus and organizing my inventory in-game a pain. I am hoping this is not a universal problem because that means I would be the only one who has ever tested it.

- Mouse wheel up and down were not rebindable to anything but the default (inventory slot next/previous); this was problematic for me since I like to have walls on wheelup and floors on wheeldown.

- The keyboard worked fine and was perfectly bindable at least for my purposes, but I had an issue with my movement getting intermittently stuck while mining things.

- The PS4 only having a paltry 2 USB ports meant that to play with keyboard/mouse I had to do without my Sony wireless headset, which irked me. I used unpowered headphones and the PS4 camera mic instead. I'm aware that there are unofficial ""USB multi-taps"" to expand the PS4's available USB ports, but I hope nobody would feel compelled to buy one for this game.

- The real dealbreaker: **the mousefeel and sensitivity is terrible**. There is no way on PS4 to even approximate the feel of a mouse on PC, no matter how I tweaked my DPI and in-game sensitivity. It seems to have inherent acceleration that cannot be disabled, and is just inconsistent. It also exacerbates the unlocked sub-60 framerate and hitching issues the game has on PS4 Pro, and is a far cry from the smoothness I expect from playing it at 144FPS+ on PC. Shaky performance feels far worse on a mouse than it does on controller, and if you want to see a truly locked 60FPS experience on console, I recommend trying Black Ops III multiplayer on a PS4 Pro. This doesn't quite cut it, no matter what Eurogamer says, and especially not at Tilted Towers.

On the positive side, on PS4 Pro the game closely matches the visual makeup of PC's High/Epic settings, and it's nice how everyone is looking at the same thing unlike the lamers and streamers who play with shadows off on PC for a competitive advantage.

I would suggest Epic either removes KBM support on PS4 outright, or improves it to a usable level so everyone else will get destroyed and complain for it to be removed. In its current state, there's no reason for it to exist.",FortNiteBR

10,RoofDaddyCOD,1520390696,82kxte,24,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/82kxte/this_isnt_the_game_i_invested_money_into/,0,This isn't the game I invested money into..,"I loved Fortnite. I have 1750 matches played, have purchased both battle passes, and probably around 4-5 2000 V-Buck skins. 

I spent this money on a game I had fun playing and when issues would arise I would stay positive and patiently wait for them to fix. As many people have stated, the game is virtually unplayable on Xbox right now. There's a ton of threads anyone can go look at right now. I used to be so pumped to get on, now I barely have the urge to play and when I do decide to get on, I play 3 or so games and get offline. 

This is the reason I left Call of Duty. I know the game is free to play and early access, but if you're going to have purchasable items, the game should at least run properly. I realize that their are weekly patches, but they can't be waiting weeks to fix things like this (especially when people like me have bought the battle pass).  I also haven't seen Epic address the problem either. 

I'm not going to be spending anymore money until I know the game is at least somewhat stable. Honestly.. I kind of feel like I deserve a refund, but I doubt that's even possible and I know I wouldn't go through the process of trying. All I know is that if the game keeps playing the same way it is now, I'm out. It sucks because I loved the game, but if you're not enjoying it, it's time to shut er down.

* 90% ""Lemme drink this real fast so no one else can.""

* 9% ""I guess I'll use this until I can find a big shield potion.""

* 1% Actually useful as a quick health/shield boost in a tight situation.

Here is my proposal on how to fix it while keeping the Slurp balanced: **allow Slurp's benefits to be queue'd up until needed if you have max health and shields** (non-stackable).  That would actually allow the Slurp to function as intended.  If you take fall damage, your Slurp covers it.  Get into a fight, the Slurp will give you the slight advantage of some extra health and shields.  As a side note, I would think that once the effect is activated, the Slurp lasts its normal duration and then stops regardless of when your health and shields top off.",FortNiteBR

The site is a scam, it's owned by a Russian guy named Trifonov Sn. (definitely Epic Games giving away free shit).
The site recreated the Epic Games Fortnite website 1:1 and added a tab called ""Special Event"" which provided you with a unique link. If you would've shared hat link with your friends, you would get 1 Pass. 4 Passes equals 1000 V-Bucks. If you had 4 passes and wanted to redeem your code, you were asked to provide your phone number. And then you would've gotten your V-Bucks. So my friend did that exact thing and now he pays €7.50 a month. 

I thought I'd share this to save you guys from paying 7.50 a month.

-Big pine trees gave 45+ wood

-Small pine trees gave 25+ wood

Recently, farming materials from trees have been changed every patch. Oak trees now often give 30 wood, big pine trees only give 25-30, and small pine trees give 9-11.

I don't really understand the need to nerf material farming. Now that I get less, I just spend more time farming and less time exploring/fighting. I usually want to farm to at least 400-500 wood during the early game and it didn't feel like such a hassle before.

Spending that extra time every game just to farm the same amount as before makes the gameplay boring and feel like a chore. As stated above, I don't understand the need to nerf materials. With the old material gain, players who used a lot of materials wouldn't have to farm as long and could move around the map faster. Players who didn't farm a lot still got a decent amount of material to work with. Now that it's nerfed, everyone just has to spend more time farming and it's more punishing on players who build a lot.

What are the benefits of nerfing material gain? I feel like it just drags out the farming phase of the game and doesn't add improvement to the gameplay of BR.",FortNiteBR

Then you choose from a set of “loadout” options:

Assault: Pistol, Suppressed SMG, M16
Duelist: Tac Shotgun, Burst Rifle, Tac SMG.
Demolitions: Grenade Launcher, Grenades, Boogie Bomb
Sniper: Pistol, Hunting Rifle, Crossbow, 
Medic: 15 Bandages, 10 Minis, Campfires, Hand Cannon.
Builder: 999x Wood, Traps, and Pistol.

Now when you land you have a radar location (think critical hit on materials indicator) within a certain amount of meters. And when you reach the spot there’s a loot chest with your chosen load out. No one can grab these items but you, and once you pick them up you cannot drop them. You can only loot from dead enemies with your same load out to acquire more ammo.

Every time you kill someone with a weapon; that weapon upgrades into the next rarity or upgrade. IE: Hunting Rifle turns into bolt action blue, m16 turns into scar, etc.

For medic: when you use a shield pot or bandage it automatically gives that shield/hp to the lowest shield teammate around you and yourself. After so many heals or shields given to teammates, your minis upgrade to big pots, bandages to medkits, to chug jugs etc. Then maybe unlock the ability to throw your medkits at teammates to heal them like grenades.

For builder: After using 500 wood, you unlock 999x brick, then metal, etc. After laying so many traps, you unlock jump-pads, then jet-packs (when released), faster building etc. A lot of the elements are the same. Would require some coding for the upgrades. 

Could be a fun way to encourage working together, especially with randoms and finding different comps. Maybe a medic, two snipers, and a builder to play the sniper tower game. Maybe you go all 4 assault or duelist like a fire team in a deployment and play out and test strategies. 

Maybe your not so good with aim but can build like a champ, build around your team and help them succeed. Maybe there’s actually upgrade kits on the ground that you find instead of requiring kills. That in itself could create different strats. Like maybe the team agrees the builder gets all the upgrade kits first for fast metal and eventually unlocks the ability to give mats to teammates, or maybe the assault man gets priority for a fast scar.

Just a thought I had, any recommendations?

It would have to take up an inventory slot, but as long as it’s equipped, let’s say it’ll regenerate 1 shield point every 2-3 seconds up to a maximum number that bases off of what rarity you have. Let’s say Epic is 25 max and Legendary is 50 max.  Would you think this would be a cool addition? Something you would use? Or maybe too OP? Thoughts and changes to the idea are welcome!

An idea for it could be like a small side island next to the main island (or just by itself, i dont care). It would have just a hill or 2 and have some trees around.

So when editing your way down from a tower, things get funky. When editing a floor beneath you, drag the tile you stand on and one other for them to disappear and you drop down automatically.

Backstory: I am playing with my normal squad, fraternity bros from college who are all now past our prime and dealing with raising kids. We normally can win a game here and there. Tragedy struck us last night as one bro (RacofBusch69) was forced to go out with his wife instead of play fortnite with the boys.    

We played some squad fill matches cause we like to carry some no-skinners sometimes. You know, practice our backpacking skills. Anyways we got matched up with TheParkingSpot2 one game and it was truly magical. When we picked Anarchy Acres, our boy ParkingSpot went with us instead of heading to Wailing woods or Tilted. That was our first hint that he might be more than a random. ParkingSpot and I headed to granny's house and my other bros went to the barns. Of course, a whole squad landed on top of granny's and the battle started. I had only an uncommon Tactical SMG and a Revolver, while TheParkingSpot found a Pump. It seemed all at once, they were on us. ""HELP!!"" I shouted to my friends who were too far to help. Just as one of the enemies went to shoot ParkingSpot, I mowed him down with the SMG. I immediately finished him off hoping he had a pump. No luck there, only a pistol. *BOOM* I was hit by a hand cannon. As fast as I could turn around and spray the SMG *BOOM* That one missed, but my spray had stopped. I knew I was dead. I tried to switch to the revolver I had. Just as I expected the last shot to come in a hero came soaring in from somewhere I did not see. TheParkingSpot used on blast from his pump to end the oppressor. Two enemies remained. I spotted one running toward my brothers at the barns. A abstract shot from my revolver managed to find the enemies head, instantly downing him. (Sidenote: Still Amazed by this) One left, but where was he. And then it hit me, a bullet that is. I went down. Completely horrified, I looked up at the monster as he showered bullets in my direction. My hero returned once again, and again only one shot was fired to kill the last enemy. I was in dismay as TheParkingSpot revived me.   
  
In the aftermath, I realized that I was the only person who took any damage and horror struck as none of us found a single bandage. We ran over toward Tomato Town hoping to find something before the second circle. My bud Trent found Bandages! Before I could get there, TheParkingSpot committed a true betrayal. He scooped up the bandages and continued to run. My friends and I Tried to trap him in a building, doing everything we could to tell him ""hey man, I need those"" After what seemed like an eternity He figured it out! He dropped a Med Kit! My savior once again.   

Now the first circle had almost enclosed when TheParkingSpot took off. I was indebted to him. I had to follow. I soon found that he was running toward an all out war between three squads. My two other friends had realized that the next safe zone was all the way at the Umbrella near the Motel, meanwhile I was headed toward wailling with TheParkingSpot because mama didn't raise no bitch. Instead of waiting to fight the victor, We immediately joined the action. 2v4v4v4 It was crazy! When the chaos had ended, ParkingSpot had taken out 4 opponents and I had taken 3. The rest other 5 had been taken out by the others. We looted as fast as week could, Gold Scars, Shields, a med Kit each and some bandages.   

Just as we finished looting we heard the terrifying sound that the storm was not encroaching. For the next minute and a half we ran. I used all of the bandages and med kit in order to reach the safe zone with ten health. My friends were there waiting for us but unbeknownst to them, a challenger was about to grenade them into oblivion. I killed this no-skinner with the ease of a hot knife through butter. In his loot, he had a chug jug! It couldn't have worked out better.  

I looked to see how much health TheParkingSpot had because I did owe him my life. In the dismay, I did not notice that ParkingSpot had gone down to the storm and was crawling toward the safe zone. Myself only having ten health, I couldn't go get him. I watched as his red bar ticketed down. Parking spot had to be less than 10 meters away! You can make it! I got as close to the edge as I could without taking damage. I stretched my arm but he was not within healing distance. 3 more steps... 2 more steps... poof, He erupted into a pile of guns, bullets, materials and broken dreams.   

My team and I went on to win the game. Any man left behind is a tragedy. You will never be forgotten. May you rest in piece with golden scars and chug jugs surrounding you.

I've come in 2nd or 3rd at least 15 times if I had to guess. The problem always comes down to the end when people are constructing these awesome bases. I never played Fortnite before Battle Royale and without somewhere to practice the best I can muster is a well. Am I screwed? Is there a possibility of a mode without building? I also only get to play solo because I don't know anyone else who plays, so it's not like I have a teacher. I'm not really frustrated because this game is really fun even without winning, but I feel like that is an impossibility without mastering building.

if someone builds better than me ok, if he got lucky sometimes and getting me with pants down ok. but if i aim, shoot and nothing hits, doesnt matter if 1 shot fired or bursts, thats not ok! one thing i cant forget is, i sneaked behind someone and he didnt notice me, even after i fired shot at him. i was around 15-20 meters behind him and shot with the deagle perfectly aimed at his head. 5 times. NOT A SINGLE BULLET HIT. i had to rush him with shotgun to get the kill, while he shouldve been dead for ages.

Since the recent patch fixing the double pump shotguns, close quarters fights have changed dramatically, and for the better. However, I believe that the pumps were changed too drastically, and they are now very unreliable, and a liability to use. Due to the slow fire rate, many top players will fire their pump, switch to a building material, put down their stairs, to block the incoming shot, and switch back to pump to fire again. However, due to the changes, the pump will sometimes have to be pumped before firing. The patch notes are fairly vague when covering this. It says when switching from a weapon to the pump, it will have to be pumped, but this feature is enabled for pump shotguns only. If it is the case that it is from every weapon, I believe it should be changed. I have watched streamers, and myself die countless times when we pull out our pumps, scream in terror ""ITS NOT SHOOTING"", and get blasted in the face. Also what I personally notice, is that we are expecting the gun to fire right away, and the delay caused makes it so that your cursor isn't on the player you're fighting, and you will miss the shot when you finally can take it. I feel it throws the whole rhythm of a fight off, and I have opted to other weapons. I personally would like the pump to only be forced to pump when switching between pumps, to negate double pumps, and nothing else, besides possibly tactical shotguns. Thank you so much for reading!


Edit: In my tired state I have forgot my biggest problem with pumps. It is when you have fired the pump, switch to another weapon (example an AR), shoot at somebody for a while, over 10 seconds usually, and forget your pump isn't racked. With you AR you get them on the defensive, you rush them, jump down on them, and bam, your pump doesn't fire, and then you're dead.",FortNiteBR

2. ""Brawn Broth"" (Epic) - A potion that when drunk after 8 seconds, enables a player to regenerate up to 25 health and 25 shields for the rest of the game when not damaged for 20 seconds. Can only be used be each player once. Comes in stacks of one, and can hold a max of two. Found in chests, as floor items, and airdrops.

3. ""Adrenaline"" (uncommon) - A syringe, that when injected, increases a players move speed by a function of half lost health divided by two, (10 health left would mean half of the lost 90, or 45, for a 45% speed boost). lasts for 15 seconds, found in stacks of one, and can hold up to 4. Found in chests and as floor items.

4. ""Railgun"" (rare) / ""Heavy Railgun"" (Epic) - Both new weapons that have a charge up time of 4 seconds. The railgun consumed 5 medium ammo upon firing, has a max clip of 15 (3 shots), and deals 135 damage (no critical damage, and rail can pierce a maximum of 3 players or wooden structures, dealing 100 damage to structures). The Heavy railgun would consume 3 heavy bullets, with a clip size of 6 (2 shots) and a charge up time of 4 seconds.  deals 200 damage upon impact with players (no critical, but is an instant kill regardless). The rail will pierce up to 4 wooden structures and players, and would deal 180 damage to structures. both are found in chests and as floor items, but heavy railgun can also be found in airdrops.

5. ""Air Flare"" (Legendary) - A flare that can be thrown at any point in the game, which will summon an airdrop on the target location. The airdrop will function as normal, making a sound and slowly descending onto the blue smoke. the Flare can only be found singularly, cannot stack, and can only be found in chests (found as often RPGs)

But I just hate when it’s the end of the match and the opponent somehow has 596 rocket ammo and the entire final 60 seconds is just a game of endless building in hopes to deflect the millions of explosives flying down from above.
 I think rocket launchers are more fair because they take a while to fly thru the air and they are easily visible and there’s enough time to maneuver and shoot back between each rocket. With grenade launchers they are almost invisible you just hear that AWFUL thwump sound over and over and watch eveything blow up all around you. 
And even if the opponent shoots all 6 shots the reload starts before the 3rd or 4th grenade even blows up and it’s ready to continue shooting JUST as the last grenade blows again so it’s pretty much endless if they’ve got the ammo. My thought is have a max amount of rocket ammo allowed to be picked up? 10-12 maybe? Just an idea. 

Also I’m salty from 3 second place finishes in a roll with 2 of them involving grenade launchers so I’m admittedly unhappy in general at the moment lol",FortNiteBR

Well, it's a cartoonic shooter after all, so realism shouldn't be a thing, but the bullet drop is too much for my taste.

So many times, my crosshair was at the target when shooting. The target was just 100m away (at max) and I still didn't hit because the projectile travelled too slowly. Not only it was awkward, it was quite depressing, too.

I hope they change something about that. Maybe give us another ""Shooting Range"" mode to adjust and sort things out... What do you think?",FortNiteBR

My internet was bad before and I was pretty casual and just messed about with mates, but now I’m trying to ‘git gud’, it’s kinda dulled my experience.

———-

Before I would just attribute losing firefights I had the upper hand in to bad internet, but now that isn’t a problem, I’m getting pissed off at my deaths. I’ve started recorded firefights that I’ve lost and it’s so infuriating to think ‘wow that hasn’t outplayed me, I’ve literally been victim to random shooting’. And that is happening so often now.


————

I get *why* they’ve implemented this sort of system to prevent extremely skilled players from getting easy long range kills, but I’m convinced it doesn’t work as intended. Surely a damage falloff system would work better than literally randomised bullet spread? I’m in situations where I’m 10m away from someone, strafing while semi-auto’ing a pistol or AR, and shots are just missing, missing, missing despite my aim being fine when I watch the clips back, and then I end up dying so someone I had the massive advantage over.

————-

Does anyone else feel this way? Now that Fortnite has moved beyond the ultra-casual quickly indie game, surely they’ve got to reduce random bullet spread?

the shotgun is the most controversial weapon in the game. There have been several reworks already but there is one thing that has not been discussed as far as I know.    

The shotgun is the only weapon in the game that you truly need in your setup. There are many weapons that support different playstyles or suit different situations but none of them is a requirement in your setup. Many situations can be handled with other weapons as well.    

Dont have a sniper? Try the hunting rifle or even an AR.
Dont have an AR? Try the MP. I guess you get the point.    

The problem is, the shotgun supports a very agile and fast playstyle. The mobility you have with this weapon is unique. No other weapon is as accurate as the shotgun while running and jumping.    

So why is this a problem? It is a problem because high mobility fights are the most common in fortnite. Because of building and the fast paced combat a movement intensive fight is the key in almost any situation.    

So... the problem is, that we dont have an alternative. You need a shotgun to have a chance. Every player will agree that this weapon is a perfect fit for many situations.    

That's why I made this post. The problem with the shotgun is not only the inconsistent damage but also the fact we have no alternative.

What are your opinions?",FortNiteBR

- the minimum possible level you would have to be to get to Tier 100 (without spending V-Bucks)

- the last possible date from which you can start progressing and reach Tier 100 (without spending V-Bucks)

- remaining stars earnable from daily challenges

- how much XP you have left until Level 100

In under half a second, the falling player places a floor and jump-pad below himself to prevent a fall-death. I see little way this is possible without macros.

Myself and other users asked devs to comment on the use of macros in Fortnite. And tbh, I started wondering how prevalent macros are in this game now. I do everything manually in this game, and would be pretty peeved if macros ever started gaining a foothold in our playerbase. 

I personally enjoy the challenge in learning to become a skillful builder with all manual controls. And tbh, I'd likely stop playing if macros became widespread in use. Myself and some others feel its cheap, lacks skill, and further decreases the building skill-gap in this game.

Could any of the devs chime in? I will tag /u/Chris_Attalus since he is a Community Coordinator for EPIC.

Before the first circle has even closed in there are only 25-30 people left in the game alot of the time. Games are often becoming a running simulator looking for fights with games ending with only 2-3 fights happening.


**What is causing this?**

The simple answer that most people will probably agree with is the introduction of Tilted Towers. Players want to drop in on the most intense spot on the map have some action packed fights. If they die? It doesn't matter just hop into another game and do it all over again. One reason people are doing this is because..


**There is no difference between winning and losing in Fortnite**

Currently there are no rewards for winning. And no this isn't going to be one of those silly points begging for 100 vcoins a win. If games had something at stake people wouldn't suicide in one spot and would spread out around the map and try to actually stay alive. Here is what I suggest..


###**Ranked Mode!**

If games had some kind of ""ranked points"" at stake, more people would actually try to win the game by trying to stay alive rather than going for a high kill score in Tilted Towers. Some people have a problem with ranked mode and I have the answers to those complaints already!

**""But Fortnite isn't meant to be competitive, it's a casual game!""**

If you feel that way, then nobody is stopping you from never playing ranked! You can stay in the casual game mode and be perfectly happy there while people who have multiple wins and want games to be more competitive can push themselves in ranked mode. Everybody is happy!

**""But it will split the player base and make queue times super long!""**

It was reported that we have over 3.4 million concurrent players, we will be fine the game is only getting bigger currently.

**""But it will turn into a camp-fest! People will camp and play safe and my quad pump strat won't work anymore!!!""**

Ranked mode will encourage players to play safer yes. Is that a bad thing? I don't think so. Better players will still rush structures with good building skills and shotguns. At the end of the day, the game is about winning and not who has the highest kill count. If it ends up you don't like peoples playstyles when they're trying to win, maybe sticking to the casual mode is for you.


If you made it this far into my post then thank you for reading! Even if you don't think that you would enjoy a ranked mode, I think its important to understand that making more players happy is a good thing for the game and will benefit you in the end.

Please give me any feedback or thoughts you have I would love to hear it.

Well people seemed to forget eventually, and February rolled around...i waited all month just hoping, knowing ide gets my wins eventually...then march came and the wins never appeared... now im worried. Worried we, or i, have neen forgotten, left with empty promises, told time and time again i had nothing to fear.

So let me ask...What happened to my untracked wins? Why was i promised time and time again that I and many others would recieve them? Did people end up getting their wins, and i somehow got skipped? Whats going on! A little update or maybe even a reply with the truth or with a solution would be enough to settle this situation.
I have close to 500 hours in this game, and several purchases, as well as the co-op campaign... Im not saying i deserve to know what happened but i do think i deserve to know if ill get my wins or not. I mean heck it maybe amounts to about 7 total wins so whats the big deal? Well i wouldnt be worried if i had some communication. 

-Thanks guys over at epic for providing me with such a great game, but a little clearing up with this would be awesome.

My wins that i can remember are 
-2 solos wins
-1 duos win
- and 2 or 3 squad wins ( its been so long youve given me too much time to remember now)

I just want a separate game mode, like solid gold or explosives only... building is part of Fortnite but sometimes I hate it.



I want to hear opinions on a mode that had building disabled, destruction would still be in the game but there would be no building at all. I think it could offer a better experience in certain parts of the game. 

Comparing it to PUBG, in fortnite, you can run through an open field and get shot three times, go down to one health by a player with good positioning and high ground, but you can take away your disadvantage just by building a fortress and healing. The player that has the better positioning is now punished for not building a fortress because the worse player now has the high ground. 

In PUBG, if a player with very good positioning sees you running through an open field and they have any skill at all, you are 100% dead. Sometimes I just wish there was a mode where I could take time to get in a good position and actually be rewarded instead of punished for it.

Some spots on the map would be unreachable, but that could be changed a little if chests would only spawn in places you can get to without building.

Knocking someone out is almost pointless unless their teammates are no where near them, because they can just build walls around them, resulting in long, drawn out fire fights that aren’t very intense.

In battlegrounds, if you get knocked out in the middle of a field, unless your teammates can kill the enemies near you, you will die indefinitely, and I just wish that kind of punishment would make its way into fortnite.

JUST TO BE CLEAR: I do not hate the building in this game. I just think that certain gameplay mechanics give advantages to players who wack off a tree for 15 minutes instead of playing fortnite like the game that it is: a shooter.

I'm sure PC players have their own suggestions for what should be added to the game. Also I'm sure these have been posted before individually but thought they should be in the same place for visibility 

1. The building system has a lot of room for improvement which could be done in more than one way. Give us a toggle setting to remove the pyramid piece so that each piece is within one toggle from each other - no one uses this piece and if they do it is converted to a ramp! *turns out people do actually like to use the pyramid for its versatility - how about letting us reorder our building pieces to have the wall and ramp next to each other?* Or a new controller scheme that has been suggested where each trigger/bumper is an assigned piece. This would allow us to build faster with a controller and bring the gameplay somewhere closer to where it is on PC 

2. Toggle option to make build mode cancel crouch. I think this was an addition for PC players but with a controller we use the same input for crouch/rotate so this resulted in panic rotating pieces while crouching and ultimately being back in the lobby before you know what's happened 

3. Toggle setting to allow sprint to cancel crouch (self explanatory). It's in most other shooters. *okay so I didn't realise there was a crouch sprint so this point can be disregarded*

4. Separate sensitivity for aiming and building. At the moment it's a trade-off between accuracy and building speed which shouldn't be the case

5. Reset building choice should also apply to trap/campfire/pad 

6. Reduce aim assist while editing. It's really quite excessive 

These aren't bugs in the game but rather unoptomised gameplay settings for controllers. With these changes the game would feel infinately better and allow us to play with the creativity that I'm sure the devs at epic want us to play with. You're doing a great job with everything else but PLEASE get a team working on these epic and show us console players some love! Oh, and thanks for 60fps!

There are videos on how to do it, guides on Facebook and Discord. I see the Twitch Prime Skins all over the lobby and game now.

Besides beeing morally wrong (as far as I'm concerned), I see two major problems here:

1 - it takes away the rarity of the skins that those who pay for Prime should enjoy, and discourages uses from keeping the Prime account. Simple as that. Those who pay should enjoy the skins, and if they are super common and people are getting it for free nobody's going to get the Prime account for it;

2 - It makes the partnership useless for Twitch/Amazon if they don't see revenue against the investment. It is going to keep them and other companies from partnering with Epic in the future.

I don't know if there is anything Epic can do about it. Maybe they should only enable the skins after the grace period, so that users will be paying at least for a month? This should keep scammers from doing it.

What do you think? Those scamming the system to get skins should be penalized?

The healing, the shields, are very scarce the chugs aren’t running rampant like crazy. We’ve totally eliminated one pump shotguns that drop you at 100/100 and tacticals. This game mode is pure skill but give the game more of a realistic feel! Feels like a hardcore COD or battlefield. As some gun games should be or have a mode just like that. What we’re avoiding with this game mode is the cheese of the pump shotgun and focusing more on player SKILL not a load of explosives going around as well because they’re very RARE in this game mode. Just straight skill shots. No more someone building up and raining down to onebang you with a white pump shotgun. The range on that thing is RIDICULOUS this game mode also gives first times a better stab at the game and not jumping into the fray to be humbled by a one shot. Keep this game mode epic and you will be well off and wouldn’t really have to nerf the shotguns. Just imagine this.

Can we get a rifle, maybe similar to the hunting rifle, where if we hit our target it does 0 damage but it makes his/her inventory fly out everywhere.  The spread and distance should be random but it should be somewhat of a hastle to pick everything back up.

How far does the stuff fly out?  I don't know.

Imagine being caught in the storm, low on health, and hitting an enemy up ahead who drops bandages for you.

Or nailing a guy up on a mountain and watching half his stuff drop off the side of that mountain.

Get to it Epic.  You have our permission!",FortNiteBR

Takes 5 seconds to consume.

You're invisible for 15 seconds but you can still get hit.

Once the 15 seconds is finished, you must watch a 10 second character animation that leaves you vulnerable to enemy fire.

Good for flanking and escaping.  But not OP at all.  What do you think?",FortNiteBR

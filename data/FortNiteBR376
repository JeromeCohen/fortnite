Two players can be fighting and another one can just sit behind cover and spam guided rockets directly at them for easy damage/kills. Yes, you can shoot it down or build around yourself, but it can be very hard to keep track of it when you're not out in the open. Also, bloom can screw you over if you try shooting it down (not to mention that it's often possible to wrap around and prevent them from seeing the rocket till it's near them), so the latter option is far more reliable. However, having to stop and box yourself in completely doesn't create fun for you or your opponent; it simply halts gameplay. The duration of it is also far too long; you can easily circle the rocket completely around yourself to see the exact location of everyone even remotely near you (and then hit someone with the rocket too). 

No, I'm not salty, and no I didn't lose to a guided missile. I just think it's a horrible idea for a Battle Royale game and seeing it used has not changed my mind.",FortNiteBR

Please don’t get triggered by this...

Mission Specialist:
These players tend to be very new to Fortnite, and are all in all no better and skilled than your average stock-skinner. There are some exceptions, such as tier 47 Mission Specs, but the majority of people who just started and got the battle pass will use this skin.

Rust Lord:
Rust Lords are often mediocre players who seem to hate the thought of a downed player, preferring to drop everything to kill a downed player. These players are often seen wearing the precision back bling, and have an unhealthy addiction to Take the L.

Moonwalker:
These players are very much the Sparkle Specialists of season three. They pop out of nowhere to finish off wounded players during or after a gunfight, and won’t hesitate to kill you if you get into a shotgun battle with them. 

Dark Voyager: 
These players are tryhards who desperately want the W. They are good in almost any situation, but they have a tendency to rage if things go badly. They also love building. 

Elite Agent:
Elite Agents are very good players who specialise in  any situation. They are good at fighting, building and strategy, and often times make it to the lategame by pure skill, dropping multiple players on their way there. They make great team players.

The Reaper (John Wick):
There two kinds of Reapers:
The good kind, who are pro players who will batter less experienced players and put up a HUGE fight before going down, and there’s the P2Wick kind, who probably busted out their mum’s credit card and bought their way to tier 100, and are often only as good as your average Moonwalker. They give the good Wicks a bad name.

And that’s it. You probably didn’t read the entire post. ",FortNiteBR

Now I noticed this today, a bright blue meteorite in the sky, going towards TT and Telescopes with a blue reflection in their lenses. Also, the Battle Pass is space themed and towards the end of the Battle Pass tiers, an explosion is being hinted at. A nuke emoticon, flame stripes and a dinosaur banner symbol at the second last tier. My theory: Tilted Towers will be blown up at the last day of this season and the next thing to come up will be something space-related, maybe aliens or some fucked up shit. Also, the Fortnite map resembles Poland and Tilted Towers lies at approximately the same position on the map where Polands Poznań is located - the place where the Morasko meteorite struck. Coincidence? I don't fucking think so!

I play on the PS4 and land at Tilted and its so frustrating to land and fall of a building and take 70 damage or die because of the HUGE lags in the beginning of EVERY match. Or land right in front of a gun but get killed because i am all of a sudden 5 feet away from that gun and an enemy got that gun. Same frustration for most of the gunfights. If you stand behind a wall and the enemy also and he peeks and you do also and you start shooting with a pump for example and you go immediately behind cover you get shot while you stand for 0.2s behind the wall.
For a shooter is the current state of the game a disaster.

First off, we have the guided missile... yeah, it’s good when the enemy doesn’t know it’s coming, but when they do, they can just shoot it down easily. I use the guided missile to shoot into large bases, but the people in the base can easily shoot the rocket without any trouble... also, it’s not as good as the regular RPG close range. I use the RPG all the time close range because it can to high damage, even if direct hit or splash damage. If you can get one good hit with the RPG you have technically won the gunfight (if no other factors come into hand). However, with the guided missile I find it’s definitely not a close range weapon, handicapping an otherwise easy gunfight to a difficult one. Having the guided missile feels like a waste of a spot for something more important in my mind. However, there is some good. I feel it will be nerfed soon anyway, disregarding it’s high damage and long travel time. But the way you can use it for rocket riding is innovative and will be a large factor in some fun gameplay. 

Secondly the shotgun changes... I loved the way the shotguns used to be and hate the way they are now. Aesthetically the grey tactical shogun just looks awful, along with having no purple one. However, I’m not sure if they changed the damage and such, but I feel picking up a blue tactical shotgun for a pump isn’t a very great idea... I’m not sure what epic was thinking when they did this. Also, this shifts the gameplay to having more pumps, and when that happens the gunfights should be better, correct? Wrong. In my experience I have noticed the pump have a nerf in either it’s sounds or firing speed. It has no sound to indicate wether you can shoot or not, or if it needs to be reloaded. On the other hand it could be out right nerfed with the firing speed. They really shouldn’t have changed the rarities if either these are the case, as they cancel each other out.

Finally the game modes... THE GAME MODES! Why can’t the community choose to keep a game mode, or choose the next game mode to come out? Surely this would be beneficial to epic for interacting with the community more and helping to make the game better for the community as a hole. All the game modes are temporary and we sure would like some semi-permanent game modes such as blitz. It seems the normal idea as all of that coding will just be moved to somewhere else anyway.

EDIT: Semi-permanent isn’t a word, regarded by a fellow Redditor. Let’s just use temporary, but for longer :)",FortNiteBR

My biggest issue with it is how it promotes camping. The idea at first that the gun leaves you helpless was good in theory as a risk, but doesnt actually happen. Its the first day I already see how this will be abused without much risk. Especially in squads where i team can build a base and watch over you, along with the fact that you can detach at any point really makes this gun risk free, if people do push at your team.

Because of this almost all late game will be campfests. You have no incentive not to sit and your base and fire rocket after rocket while your team shoots and makes holes for your rockets to hit. On top of that you can hit from above which makes being out in the open extremely dangerous. Why risk that when you can build a base and open and close a roof with editing?

I know its only been a day but I'm very surprised the devs pushed this weapon through. They do everything to make this game not ""Base wars"" (reducing mats, etc), but i think this one slipped through and although itll be fun, i can already see this making for a stale late game. Pushing, enemies late game will become difficult and a camping meta will start to form. 

I know ill definently get some hate because ""Its been 1 day, everyone says every new gun is OP/Bad for the game at first."" Just wanna make it clear that i dont think the gun is OP, the play style change it causes is the problem.

Most people recognize the need for long range fort destruction, but loathe the other ways rockets can be used (mostly people using them as a type of shotgun).

The Guided Rockets seem like they’ve got a lot of counterplay that the traditional ones do not, and while the counterplay comes at a cost to the raw effectiveness of the weapon, there are obvious upsides, like being able to control the rocket.

With Guided Rockets, there seems to be a delay in the takeoff of the rocket speed which immediately discourages you from using the weapon in CQC. The enemy also has the option of potentially shooting the rocket down. The rocket can also be in a sort of “set it and forget it” mode, where it continually projects forward after you’ve stopped remote controlling it.

The sum of all these characteristics, to me, feels like an attempt to offer an extremely viable alternative at long range fort destruction and general sieging with a much healthier gameplay philosophy (namely legitimate drawbacks other than just bugs, like the direct hit rocket glitch) than the polarizing standard Rocket Launcher.

(Keyboard vs Controller discussion),"So I am a long time console gamer and have been on Fortnite for about 6 weeks now. While I am not amazing at the game I have over 20 wins (would have more but I have a problem with choking at 2nd place 25% top 10 finishes in solo) and have had 12 kill games and tend to be a decent player. 
I keep hearing people talking about how much better KB+M players are than traditional console players. I have played a few matches on PC (with a controller) and really don't see much of a difference in the level of gameplay. That being said I was curious to jump in a game (cross platform which will only have PC users) with some decent PC gamers to see if I am really that far behind. 
I really would rather not switch to keyboard, I am probably going to be moving to a SCUF first to see if that increases my level of play but feel where I am at not with a regular Xbox controller is decent. I watch some big streamers on PC (of course NOT Myth or Ninja level) and it just doesn't look like they are better than me but would love to see for sure. If any PC gamers out there would like to add me to their Epic friends list my name is the same as this Dr McFunk. Anyway would love a peaceful discussion about the subject if you are interested.

We know there are quite a few of apps where you have to input details about yourself to look for others, but honestly: who has time to fill out a whole dating profile~ish page about themselves? How can you know these profiles are accurate? And who feels like reading through these?&amp;nbsp;

All this can be solved by collecting data from the game itself to save you as much manual input as we possibly can while guaranteeing accuracy, which is what we are intending to do!
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

The app will:&amp;nbsp;

- Set up a profile for you, which you can later customize.
- Validate that people are who they say they are.
- Show you cards of relevant players that you can match with (same platform, similar skill, etc.)
- Show analytics about each player to help you choose the perfect Fortnite duo partner.
- Allow players to match when they have interest in playing together and chat together!
&amp;nbsp;

Think of it like Tinder clone but for Fortnite duo/squad partners and in no way a dating app.
&amp;nbsp;

We're almost done and we would really like to release as fast as possible, that's why we need your help: we have a bunch of stuff we need to test and are opening our private beta so you guys can help us out.&amp;nbsp;

That's why we created this landing page: http://fnbrmm.launchrock.com/ &amp;nbsp;

to receive early signups. &amp;nbsp;

There is a huge advantage for those using a keyboard and mouse against players using their controllers; with a controller we have to order our weapons in a ""comfy"" position and it takes longer for us to build, whereas with a keyboard you can assign weapons and building slots to keys that require no movement of your fingers at all, making it quicker and easier to play the game.




If I recall correctly, a developer suggested placing users with a controller on mobile into servers with PS4 players and I ask why? The answer is obvious and it's because of an unfair advantage to whomever is using a controller. So why are we on console being forced to play with users that have an unfair advantage that the developers support? Throw anyone with a keyboard and mouse into matchmaking with PC players, continue to support keyboard and mouse on console but don't let them play with console players, it's unfair.

There are still some really trivial options that are missing and are holding us console players back.


#**Sensitivity**

**We need Sensitivity control from 0-100 with increments of 1 (or 0-10 with 0.1).**
Especially now when MKB users can set their mouse sens like that.


#**Building Pieces Order**


Was suggested here many times but i had to mention it again.


Walls and Stairs are the most used building pieces under pressure and we need to press a button 2 times in order to switch between them which is detrimental to be able to fast build.


**We need some way to put Stairs next to the Wall ,or overall a way to Edit the Building Pieces Order.**


#**Aim Assist**


This is for me the most important thing that needs to be addressed.
I will split this category into 2 parts:


##**Aim Assist while Editing buildings**


I'll be blunt here, no one needs aim assist while editing GIANT SQUARES, it just slows you down.


**We need an On\Off switch for Aim Assist while Editing.**


##**Aim Assist while Shooting - Strength and Window Size**


Overwatch had the same problem and they used those expressions so I'll use that for the explanation:


*Aim Assist (strength)* - the strength of which your reticle sticks to the enemy or How much your sensitivity is lowered when aiming at an enemy.


*Aim Assist Window Size* - how big is the zone which the aim assist start. setting to 0 means the assist window is the exact  size of the player model, setting it higher will make the window go beyond the model itself.


Right now in Fornite the Aim Assist is too Strong and the window size is way too big (goes too much beyond the player model) making your sensitivity too slow before your reticle is actually on the enemy player.


[Approximate Visualization of the AS window!](https://i.imgur.com/Pj9lBu4.jpg)


[Taken from this video!](https://giant.gfycat.com/RareObedientBedbug.webm)


All we have is an On\Off switch for Aim Assist as a whole.

**We need an Aim assist Strength and Window Size controls:
AS Strength: 0-100 where 0 is no AS and 100 is the current state.
AS Window Size: 0-100 where 0 is exactly the size of the model and 100 is the current state.**



**TL;DR:**

We need more freedom of control for console:

**Sensitivity control from 0-100**

**A way to put Stairs next to the Wall ,or overall a way to Edit the Building Pieces Order.**

**On\Off switch for Aim Assist while Editing.**

**Aim assist Strength and Window Size controls from 0-100**

The idea that if I'm a better player than the 99 other players in the game gives me a much larger chance to win the game makes the game fun. Obviously a ""less skilled"" player can outdo a better player due to some RNG, luck, etc. but Fortnite always did a great job at keeping a wide skillgap in the game.

That being said, does it seem like Epic MAY be slowly making the mistake of trying to close the skill gap to appeal to new/casual players? A lot of games do this due it being a good business decision, plain and simple.

Im talking about decisions like the mini gun, guided rocket, heavy shotgun. They're essentially beginner friendly versions of weapons that would normally take more work and finess to get your kill with.

Thankfully the mini gun was a wash-out. The heavy shotty is only slightly more advantageous than the original shotties in certain situations, and the guided rocket is yet to be judged.

So yes, the game is still fine and the skillgap is still there for the most part (although skillgap at launch was wider than it is now), but do you think that this is the direction that Epic plans to go in for the long term? Making easy to use weapons/items for the sole purpose of casual appeal and funny youtube clips instead of trying to keep the competitive aura around it?",FortNiteBR

 * Pump Shotgun and Hand Cannon fire animations have been polished, improving readability and snappiness.

##A+A Bug Fixes

* Fixed the glow effect on some chests that were glowing white.

1. Shoot the missle down, I’ve tried it and you can indeed shoot it down

2. Build a wall which is pretty self explanatory 

3. Push whoever shot the rocket so they got to get out of the rocket mode. Basically if you are close enough and they shoot a rocket at you just rush them, it’ll make them have to get out of rocket mode if they see you pushing or you will just get an easy kill.

The gameplay would be very similar to solo to start off. Everyone drops alone and is solo to start the game. However the big difference would be that when you engaged an enemy player and downed them you would have the option to eliminate or revive them. If you chose to revive them they would become a teammate and you could continue on together. 

I wanted to address a few questions and hope to make this as clear as possible right off the bat:

What if the guy I just revived gets up and kills me?

Answer: He wouldn't because once you revive him you become invincible to his attacks while he would still take damage from yours. If you revive someone and deem them to be a nuisance/dead weight you can simply dispatch them and move along with the game. 

Wouldn't games go on forever if everyone could just keep reviving everyone?

Answer: No because you can only be revived one time and by only one person. If you are downed a second time you are eliminated entirely. If the ""King"" of your team is eliminated then everyone that is currently serving him is eliminated automatically as well.

Why would i want to keep playing if I can't get the W and if my stats aren't recorded?

Answer: Any member of a ""Kings guard"" that survives the duration of the game will be rewarded with a squad win and all kills would also count towards squad numbers. There would also need to be a separate metric for ""King Wins"" for when you won as the leader of your team.

Please let me know if you have any ideas or additions! Thanks for your time have a great day/evening.

Like bright pink.,"Whenever I watch a stream of someone playing against other players using these crazy brightly colored skins, they seem to get picked off pretty easily.

That's not to say that the pros aren't using these skins, I see some of the pros mess around with them. But I'm just curious, like, why wouldn't someone try to use a more camouflaging skin?

Something that will blend them into the landscape/area they are in a bit better than... Say... A giant pink teddy bear... Thing! lol!

I know I will be using the least conspicuous skins I can find!

EDIT: Settle down guys, I'm not talking about players that like to hide in one spot and camp. I'm talking about blending into your surroundings while you're on the move... *Facepalm* @ some of these comments lol!

Thanks to those that gave real answers! The general consensus is that they either A) just like the skin, or B) WANT other players to see and engage them! That definitely makes sense for an aggressive playstyle! Thanks to you guys for the real answers!!

Again... No... I'm not a bush hiding camper... I just want to blend in while I'm running around... Who is going to be spotted first running through a forest, a player in a dark green outfit, or a giant pink bear?

For me, the camo would be more for when I'm running from place to place and I don't have as much resources or cover as I'd like. Pretty logical I think.",FortNiteBR

For example a 10v10 TDM mode or something. Anyone else likes this idea? You can get better at shooting aswell for the ones that want or need that, and you can play Fortnite in a more casual way.

(Not GUIDES per se but tips/tricks and all sorts of things that will separate the average player from the best players.)

In the guide I'm reading right now it mentions that Metal isn't the best choice to build in most cases. Wood is. Wood has 100 HP where as Metal has 70. How much does brick have?

Also, if metal has less HP than wood, what is the benefit of using metal to begin with? (I don't mean for that question to sound like I'm doubting anything, I legit want to know!!)

Thanks for any great information you guys give me!! Happy fragging!

EDIT: Thanks for all the great information guys! I see now that there is a starting HP and a final HP for structures and that wood just starts with more, but has less final HP! Awesome!! Thanks again!!",FortNiteBR

So one tends to wonder... why the hell haven't warning emails gone out? Yeah you know, the thing that MOST companies do, when they realize they have been breached? Is it to somehow try to save face over this bs?

I was talking to a mate earlier today, and it just dawned on me how well executed everything do to with Fortnite BR has been.

###Firstly - Price

There is none... The game is Free-To-Play which means its accessible, unlike other games.
If you have a big bank or a little bank, it makes no difference you can have the game.

###Secondly - The Accessibility

How in goodness name has the BR Version been ported to *everything* so quick?
At this rate I think it'll be on some Nokia from 1990. But jokes aside, Epic have identified a massive hole in the market for iOS (and im sure Android eventually) and capitalised on it... 

Then chuck in some cross-play with PC and PS4 meaning teams can be filled with random players and iOS Players don't feel left our on their own.

###Thirdly - The Cosmetics

I touched on it in the first point but because the game is Free-To-Play
People like me, and many various others of you have gone oh its free that's cool. But hey look I can MAKE IT RAIN for 500 V-Bucks and bam you've spent money on the game for cosmetic. This isn't me having a paddy, that is me saying well flipping done Epic for that.

I have never ever spent money on a game before for Cosmetic things. Period.
That is until Fortnite, They have made the game so well done that I am actually willing to spend my money so that when I kill someone I can flip and land on my back in a sexy pose, That is hilarious.

###Fourth - The Game itself

Battle Royale, one of the if not the most popular genre of games at the moment in time..
Cross that with Borderlands Style graphics, Silly Outfits, Easy Mechanics, Good Gameplay and Fun Teamwork
What do you get? 

Fortnite Battle Royale. The graphics makes the game good from the Youngest to the Oldest, because they are not harsh they just ""easy"" to look at.

The outfit / emotes are hilarious man, why would I not want to run around in a pink Cuddly Bear Outfit while shooting people

The building mechanics are easy to understand and add such a unique dynamic to the game, you in a fire fight? Build up! Are they building up too? Learn to build quicker or out play them..

The Gameplay itself, you can launch yourself across the map with an Impulse Nade and pick someone off.
Or why not rocket ride yourself to someones base and ping them off?

Finally the Teamwork, I work in Youth Work a lot, playing this game has built some strong relationships between me and some of the Youth I look after.
It gives us something to talk about, it also builds the communication between us and we genuinely just have fun.

###Fifth - The Communication

This speaks for itself, but their Community Management is sick. Their Social Media is active and they actually LISTEN to us.
Plus the launch trailer for the Guided Missile is hilarious, if you haven't watched it yet watch it here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTufcjFo688)

Good marketing team.

###Finally - The Updates

With patch V3.4 Just releasing today.

The frequency in which the game updates astounds me, they fix bugs, they bring out optimisations not for their favourite platform, but for every platform everytime...


They rotate things to keep it fresh, like remember how fun the 5 teams of 20 was?! 
Actual flipping pandemonium. But they didn't keep it for too long, they had it for hype and then removed it.
Now with this release there are sniper shootouts again... Its just ridiculous the frequency

Not only that but they add new guns and remove dead ones or obsolete ones. This guided missile I am so excited for.

###Summary
Honestly guys, I could write more and rave about Epic, but WELL DONE guys. On making an absolute killing of this game.

But more so **WELL DONE** on not letting that shroud your updates, community or the game itself.

Keep killing it guys.",FortNiteBR

The game is quite frankly unplayable for me. I don't know what the issue is but my game is constantly freezing and lagging it's out of control. Almost every game I land and my game is lagging so much then it freezes for a good 3-4 seconds, by the time the freezing is over I'm almost always dead or landed in some unknown place I didn't intend to go to. I'm also having issues with buildings and houses not rendering for a good 4-5 seconds after I land, as in I see the building is there I just can't walk inside because it's just all a blur and it hasn't rendered yet. I see people landed next to me and disappear inside the buildings while I can't interact at all and have to wait for the buildings to finish rendering. 

Is this normal? Is the game not optimized for Xbox 1 and only for next gen?

If any one knows a solution to this as I love this game and I've been trying to put in the hours and enjoying myself but it I die 4-5 games in a row without being able to even move for me to have a longer game where I hope no one is landing near me until the freezing is done and I can start actually playing the game. 

I tried landing in every spot and the rendering/freezing/lagging doesn't really change that much. It sure is a lot worse in areas with a lot of players landing but I tried landing far and it didn't really change that much.

Edit: Or maybe some PS4 players can tell me if they're having the same issues?",FortNiteBR

If a No boom system is not coming to Fortnite(like Shooting Test 2), then I can no longer continue to play or spend money on this game.","I play games for fun. And Fortnite, for quite some time was a TON of fun. But slowly, little by little, the game repeatedly began to show it's flaws.

I really like this game. It has a lot of fantastic things in it that make it a really good game and deserving of it's popular status.

Fantastic Ultrawide support, Funny kooky graphics and design elements. It's lighthearted, and also somewhat serious. And the building aspect is really really intense and introduces skill to a game that is really a different way of thinking about Shooter games.

Fortnite has some really good and interesting design concepts and execution that makes it so much fun to play, except for one huge glaring, serious chink in that armor: Weapons do not shoot where I point them. AKA Bloom.

My friends and I even have phrase for this. We call it getting ""Bloomed Out."" And my streamer friend's first affiliate Emote on Twitch, was actually a Flower with ""BLOOM"" in it. 

Bloom has become this major thorn in my side, sneaking problem that just has no future improvement prescribed from EPIC. 

And I'm not some terrible bad player either. I'm not amazing, truth be told. I'm no where near a Myth or Ninja here, but I do have 350+ Collective wins, and around a 16.5% Win ratio.  Not good, but not terrible.

Bloom has made me outright stop playing Solo mode. The only reason I ever solo anymore is for the fact that my Squad does not like to do quests for the battle pass in the middle of us playing together.

So when everyone gets off, I do a solo to get some of the quests done, and then I don't touch it.

I cannot be asked to take part in a 1 life only system where my skill is not the determing factor as to whether I deal damage or not. 

If I aim a weapon at a location, I expect my weapons to fire bullets at said location.

But when this doesn't happen, it becomes utter frustration.

I should not have moments in game where I am saying things like ""Oh thank you for not blooming me out game"" and I feel like the game is allowing me to get a kill.

This sort of thing has outright turned the game from a super fun, and amazingly interesting new game that I could sink my teeth into, into a game I only play to get the battlepass done, and then I go and play something else.

Epic, I really like this game. I love so much about it. There are so many positive things about Fortnite that make the game important. 

But at this point I have made a decision. Once I complete the Season3 Battlepass. I will not be spending anymore money or playing the game any longer.

Until the Bloom issue is rectified, I can't take the game seriously anymore.

Imagine if you were playing Mario Kart and the Joystick randomly chose how far you were turning. It wouldn't be fun at all.

Imagine if you were playing soccer, and when you kicked the ball it randomly chose to veer off and misses the goal. How do you ever learn how to properly kick a ball if the ball randomly veers off?

This is how I feel about Fortnite nowdays.

I know I'm simply 1 player in a sea of millions, meaning I basically do not matter. But I can't be alone in such a frustrated state.

I like to play games for fun, but I do not find a game fun when my success is determined by a dice roll instead of my own actions.

""Just build"" Isn't a very good stand point in this case either. This isn't about the building aspect of the game.

In short you cannot master a random system. There is no real getting around a situation where when you aim at someone, and you get the right shot and you build correctly and yet you miss your shot simply because the game rolled the dice and you got unlucky. We've seen it happen to even the best of players.

Shooting Test 2 was so fun to play, and it was so fantastic to improving the game. And after reading Epic comments that basically spell out that we will never get such a system, It seems like the only real solution to this frustration is to simple find something else to play.

I don't like that solution, but I like it more than being frustrated.

Thank you for listening to my rant and thoughts.",FortNiteBR

The Golden Ticket is an item that sends you back on the Battle Bus as soon as you die (not game over).  You essentially jump out of the Battle Bus with no weapons instead of going back to lobby.

Instead of debating whether or not you want the item in the game, let's discuss how you would want it implemented instead.  Here's what I'm thinking...

1.  It spawns, like the Loot Llama in 3 random locations around the map.

2.  If you kill someone who has the golden ticket, they drop all their loot but a golden effect flashes upon death signifying to all nearby players that he/she has and is using TGT.

3.  TGT is an item you must carry, not a trap slot item.  You have to make room for it in inventory.

4.  When you cash in your Golden Ticket, you jump out of the Battle Bus with a golden effect around you which means you're invincible to storm damage until the moment your feet hit something.  Then you're vulnerable to storm damage like everyone else.

What do you think?  Is that the best implementation?",FortNiteBR

I posted this as a comment in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/87wsgo/a_popular_redditoryoutuber_stole_part_of_the/) but I wanted to make a separate post so it can perhaps get more visibility.

The criticism in regards to me using the screenshot someone posted of a text message conversation from PS4 chat as part of my thumbnail in one of my videos is pretty fair and I accept it. I hope that I can use that feedback from the community and improve myself as a content creator going forward. 

However, OP [contacted me on Twitter](https://imgur.com/a/jwJpC) about using the screenshot of his conversation and said it ""wasn't a big deal."" I gave him credit in the description of the video so I'm surprised to see him post this. Still, I understand and accept the criticism I am receiving about using the image even though I have some disagreements about some of the thoughts expressed in the comments.

One thing I do not accept at all is this comment from /u/SweetBlackNuts talking about how I treat my ""wife."" First of all, I am not married but her IGN is MrsBoJanglles so I can see how you might have been confused. 

SweetBlackNuts, you must be the guy that sent me [this message](https://imgur.com/a/dURMT) on YouTube where you call me a piece of shit and say I'm full of toxicity. I have no idea what you're talking about so I just shrugged you off as a troll but since you are now trying to spread misinformation I had to go through the VoD of my stream so that I could defend myself. 

&gt; Bobby however becomes tilted because of this and throws hatred towards her and blaming her because of his loses and deaths. And basically fucks her off on stream and goes solo, completely ditching her out of the blue in the most harsh way possible.

[Here are clips from the stream where I played duos with MrsBoJanglles.](https://youtu.be/WARGKAGIC6Y). That is every death and my reaction to it while we were playing together. At no point did I blame her or ""throw hatred"" towards her. In fact, most of the time I take personal responsibility for my own mistakes. In case you think I might be cherry-picking to make myself look good, [here is the entire stream](https://youtu.be/eSGA4x7UxJM?t=1081). I play with MrsBoJanglles from 17:40 to 1:17:42. 

I told her ""GGs I gotta go play some solos.""  to which she responded ""Yeah, I'm trash."" I then told her ""It's not you, its because I'm playing awful and duos is just making me play worse."" I said this because I believe duos is harder than playing solos (you might disagree but thats just my experience). 

I am very glad to have received some constructive criticism from the Reddit community, but these comments from SweetBlackNuts and a couple other people were truly disturbing to me. I get tilted sometimes and I don't always have the perfect reaction when I die, but to claim I'm abusive or hateful really upsets me and I'm sad to see that the Reddit community made this the top comment instead of discussion about the actual criticism that is relevant to this post.

I don’t play mobile so if the vbucks aren’t connected I have no clue how I got the 100 i already had on mobile, I only downloaded mobile with the idea of finally being able to spend the exact amount of money the vbucks cost instead of buying a 20$ psn card and only using 13$. Any answers would be appreciated so I can relax/cry. 

Edit: it even says I have 1000 vbucks on other platforms, if the vbucks we buy on mobile aren’t connected to the accounts on other platforms that seems like a problem to me",FortNiteBR

This is only the intro but I'm curious what yall think.    

     
Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Fortnite. From the goofy emotes and cartoon graphics to the
 intense shootouts, there is a lot to enjoy about this game. At any given time of day or night, I can hop online and 
be thrown into the arena with ninety-nine other players, in a desperate attempt to loot, shoot, and build my way to
 victory. In a nerdy yet amusing way, I think the University of Maryland Baltimore County captured the excitement 
of this game perfectly when they described their upset over No. 1 seed Virginia as “like winning your first game of
 Fortnite.” Best of all, it’s free!

     
Does that make me a little biased? Maybe. Regardless, when we take an objective look at it, is it really all that 
good to get swept up with the rest of the world in search of a Victory Royale? You’ve heard of those people who get
 addicted video games, locked away in their rooms – never to see the sunlight again. You’ve read up on the studies
 showing how video games will slow development and almost certainly lead to violence. Granted, the sole purpose 
of this game is to eliminate all enemies to be the last left alive, but does that really mean all these negatives are 
true? While in extreme cases (as with anything), addictive and negative tendencies can appear – I’m inclined to 
disagree. 

     
Fortnite, when played in moderation, does not lead to the negative tendencies we often assume video games
 do; rather, it has the potential to promote comradery among friends and develop critical thinking and an inept 
ability to handle stressful situations, and is a fine way to spend free time.

The only things PUBG has that we don't are first-person and vehicles.","Honestly, third person is a really difficult perspective to aim and shoot with. I think, especially thinking about the absence of vehicles, maybe a first person only mode or even a hotkey to swap to it in normal games would be an astronomical improvement.

I can see several reasons why this would be an improvement. First of all, playing in first person provides for a more immersive experience. It's far more immersive and would give a far stronger adrenaline rush. When I think about PUBG versus Fortnite, I do love fortnite. I really do. It just doesn't have that same ""HOLY SH*T! Oh, I'm dead. Can enjoy the rest of the rush now"" feeling. In fortnite, all that happens is I see some person I'm looking at get shot (oh, that's me?) and it just doesn't have the same feel.

I know several players like myself that perform far better in first person. This is an extension of the immersion paragraph. A rule of thumb for me is ""the more seriously I take the game, the better I do. The more I convince myself I'm there, the better I perform."" Playing in first person makes it a ton easier to ""trick myself"" into believing a bit more that I'm there in person. Third person perspective doesn't exactly exist in real life yet, so perhaps we might have to accommodate first person in games first.

Last but absolutely least, playing in first person would reduce strain on many machines by reducing the FOV of the camera, causing less of the scene to need to be rendered. Maybe my brother's computer could run it at 24 fps instead of 13...

Side note: Adjustable FOV would be nice too. I know people can get one heck of a headache from too small or large of an FOV.

Now, I can't have a community post like this without some sort of way to measure that the community agrees or disagrees. Upvotes are fine, but they aren't really reflective. If a post gets 20 upvotes and 2 downvotes, you still see the number 18. Not 20-2, just 18. Thus, I thought I might set up a poll.

tl;dr:
Please implement a first person mode or option. I made a poll.

Straight off the bat, it’s a 100% free game. They could have made it something  like 99cents, which would have netted millions of dollars. But no, they aren’t greedy like 95% of game companies out there. 

Second, they listen and respond to the consumers. Once the glitch “rocket riding” was discovered, most companies would have instantly gotten rid of it because it wasn’t intended. Epic realized it was a great feature, and decided to embrace it. 

Third, they give us weekly updates with fresh content. Can’t say many companies do the same thing. 
^they also give us a lot of awesome new modes, make a mobile version, try to cross play betwneeen as many platforms as possible, etc.

Anyway, thanks Epic, for being so amazing and making a great game. ",FortNiteBR

* The target can damage anyone, but the other player's can only damage the target (so essentially anyone who isn't a target is on the same team).

* 15 minute max match length like blitz.

* if the target kills a player, then they no longer become the target and it moves on to a different player, while they are put at the end of the list to become the next target. 

* If someone kills the target, then they are put at the end of the list to become the next target.

So for example 5 players are left, A, B, C, D and E. 

A is the target, and he kills B. The target moves to C and A will be the last in the list to be selected as a target. If D kills C (or vice versa), then E will be the next target. Now It's a 3 way, so whoever kills the target will have the advantage of seeing the last player on the map, just like if E kills any of the other 2 players, then they will have the advantage of seeing the last guy on the map.

Graphics on my Xbox one X are pretty good but the FPS on PC would be absolutely a game changer. I realize this is for all games but watching alot of FN streamers made it very apparent.

Im an average player and everytime i get the rpg i know my chances of winning increase by 5x. I ""outplay"" good players with high winrates that would easily kill me by just whipping out my rocket launcher and nearly one shotting them. I just feel dirty when i use it because i abuse the hell out of its power. ""Just build lol"", well good players that i blast have a hard time reacting to that unexpected shotgun range rocket blast especially when im above them.

Not to mention lategame when i have 40 rockets and the other guy cant do anything because im spamming him with them until he runs out of materials or tries to rush me and dies.

If i get this thing early game i dont even pick up a shotgun because i know nobody will expect it at all.",FortNiteBR

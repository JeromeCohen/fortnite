I think we are forgetting the basics..

♤ Starting the fight with a knock.

Don't rush a team when you know damn well they'll just mow you down after you do 16 damage with that blue pump. 

Get good with a sniper - carry explosives- aim for the head with your ar/smg. Come on now..

♤ Repositioning 

Say you are making moves in tilted and you spot a dude across the street and you land 3 good AR shots and go back to cover. Now he's on guard. 

DO NOT peak back out from the same spot. NO, at that time you move to a different location and shoot some more AR rounds. 

Say you are leaving tilted and heading into the plains of dusty and you see a squad. You take a few shots but could get the knock, so they all start building like maniac. Getting ready to splode you down with rpg grenade launcher p90 magic dust. 

Dont build a 1x1, dont rush them. Instead pull back. Move towards the closest natural high ground. And when they start to follow you, capitalize on their mistakes and start lowering them/knocking them. Remember to make the fight favorable to you.

I wanted to take my mind off this new meta for a bit so I came up with an idea: Lets do a quick community poll on who the top 10 players are in Fortnite right now. 

Rules:

- Only reply to this post with submissions for who you think should make the top 10. The players you submit don't necessarily have to be your pick for #1 in the game right now. As long as you think they should be in the top 10, suggest away. Please suggest only one name per person. This will reduce the chance of there being duplicates in the comments. 

- After that, we'll use the upvoting system to determine the list. Simply upvote any names you see that you think should make the top 10. Try not to downvote any names as it'll muddy the waters a bit and make the winners harder to calculate. If you see a name in the comments you disagree with, be a pal and just let it live. I trust this community to not simply mass upvote or downvote popular names just to circlejerk. In other words, I'm hoping you guys don't just massively downvote or upvote guys like Ninja or Myth. If you genuinely think these guys deserve top 10, give them an upvote. If not, simply move on. 

- I'll leave this post up for about a day or so and then create a new post with the top 10 right after. At that point I think we could have a cool discussion about who the consensus best players are.

Yes Fortnite is in kind of a weird state right now, with the competitive scene in an even weirder state. I hope we can not take this thing too seriously and just have fun with it. Maybe this can be something the community does every month or so - we can create a real time power rankings in the community and maybe promote some inanely skilled players that haven't gotten as much shine on Twitch/YouTube.

To the mods - if I'm breaking any rules or doing this wrong please let me know. I have no problem taking the post down or making a new post with some adjustments. Just looking to have some fun and possibly learn about some new players.

*For those of you that don't know you can go into your fortnite settings and select sprint by default on. This way you can sprint just by holding your analog stick forward.*

Last night i tried using L3 as B/O for my building menu and it became rather difficult because so many times i accidentally click in the left stick because of 10 months of sprinting.  And this only happened when i was in build battles. This canceled my build menu and in build fights would usually plummet to my death.

SUGGESTION: in your console settings try switching your L3 to crouch and R3 to edit/build.  L3 for crouch would make it so it doesn't affect your aim so much when crouching because your right stick controlls your camera angle.  Also R3 for edit/build because you can't crouch when you are in build mode anyway so you should never accidentally click it to exit out your menu.  I feel like the right thumb feels more natural for editing anyway because thats whats been used to click B/O.  

**TLDR:** Turn on sprint by default in settings. Map L3 to R3 and then R3 to B/O in your console settings. ",FortniteCompetitive

But instead of damaging other parts of the game with balancing issues why not add different skilful strategies to kill a player who is turtling?

Chucking a stink grenade and killing someone who is turtling is not skillfull. (Cannot be countered and lowers the skillgap)

Holding mouse 1 at someone who is turtling and hoping a bullet finally hits is not skillfull.

Throwing 4 C4's and instantly destroying 5 walls is not skillfull. Lowers the skill gap yet again.

Every attempt they have made at fixing turtling has resulted in the games skillgap being decreased. And causes players to be frustrated, rightfully so. If they cannot find a suitable way to fix turtling than the BR Esports for fortnite might have to switch to a different mode....

For example the slow pull out on the pump after editing made a big difference, a nerf that should be reverted. Encourage players to attack people who are turtling but attack them in a way that presents skill. Small strats like this should be prioritised. There are other ways... EPIC just have to find them.
But to be completely honest I dont think the turtle meta will ever be fixed. I cant see any player no matter how big the nerf deciding that 4 walls around them and a roof is a bad idea in any situation.

You dont fix turtling by adding a weapon that can shoot through a wall. Like..... what are they thinking??

But I can definitely tolerate another player turtling for a few seconds compared to cheesy/gimmicky ways which lower the skillgap.

I know its another complain post but times are rough right now for fortnite. Especially with another tournament on Saturday.

Regardless of how you feel about playing this game, if you’re a truly competitive player, you’ll find a fucking way. It isn’t impossible to win.

I remember playing baseball when I was a kid, and the only pitch we were ever dealt were fastballs down the pipe. One day during a regional tournament, this pitcher on the other team threw sliders and curveballs. He destroyed our team. Since that day I realized one thing, there will always be someone striving to be the best, and if you don’t keep up, you’ll be left far behind.

The same concept applies to these consistently confusing changes. Sure, it’s not what we fucking want. We are forced to adapt. Venting and complaint here isn’t helping you get better as a player.

Gone are the days of turtling in a 1x1, create a network of tunnels.

Gone are the days of no editing; if you can’t edit quickly you’ll get worked.

Gone are the days of your ramp/wall push; you had better learn to gain high ground another way.

Gone are the days of taking no damage in a fight; you probably should learn to play a little more tactically.

The hardest pill for people to swallow here is that hey were completely average to begin with. A meta shifts, they can’t adapt, they resort to complaining and bitching about Epic. If you don’t want to be a completely average player, then actually figure out how to deal with how you’re dying.

Everyone in this sub will die to a bot, maybe the circumstance was unavoidable, but that’s an exception to the rule. There is something you could have done differently and it’s up to you to figure it out. If you can’t, you’ll consistently die the same way.


We don’t take build battles to the sky anymore, so fucking what? All this means is you have mats for the next fight. End your build fights as quickly as you can, try to limit it to 3-4 stories high. Figure it out.

Good players are having a hard time adjusting to the changes. Great players aren’t. If anything great players have an upperhand now.

This sub is meant to be used to discuss ways to get better, ask questions, and improve your play. Don’t get caught up with this bandwagon of tears. Acknowledge it fucking sucks and move forward.",FortniteCompetitive

I made a post in r/FortniteBR  and u/M1PY suggested I make a cross-post in this subreddit. Despite this being the competitive sub  I'd reckon that most of us here would categorize ourselves as mid-tier, somewhere in the 50-75% percentile on a skill basis. My sentiment was that changes like early season 5 updates hurt us the most by lowering the skill gap and limiting opportunities for outplay through non-gunplay mechanics. These are the mechanics that we have learned and practiced and while they have allowed us to separate ourselves from most of the masses in the past, season 5 is a different story. Catering to casuals is not a wise business decision since they are not invested in the meta and doing so only hurts mid-tier players who will lose interest when they see that their time and efforts are going to waste.

**Beginning of Original Post:**

**My Fortnite Background**:

I consider myself an okay/mid-tier player (S4/S5: 3-4 K/D, PC: bottomhausvirgin for reference). Mostly unrelated, but I enjoy Fortnite for the social aspect of Squads, a game mode that's become less enjoyable due to the SMG/splodes meta shift. I've definitely started to lose interest in this game and become increasingly frustrated with the current state of the game and this post explains my thoughts.

**Effect of early Season 5 changes:**

1. Success now strongly influenced by RNG: Looting SMG/Splodes, hoping bloom is in your favor
2. Building nerf to limit opportunities for outplay

End of season 4 was a great place for Fortnite. A variety of loadsout were still viable. ARs and shotguns were still an option, SMGs were still strong (hence Tac SMG nerf). Now ARs and shotguns are obsolete. SMG weapon class has become so versatile that it can be used for CQB, building clearance, and mid-long range pickoffs.

**My guess at Epic's motives**

1. Cater to large low-skill player base by reducing the skill gap and skill cap.
2. Make competitive scene (pros vs pros, not pubstomp contest) more exciting by discouraging turtling

Dividing the player base into low-skill/mid-tier/pro players, these changes hurt the mid-tier players the most, and I will rationalize this by giving my impressions on how these changes have affected these portions of the player base.

**For low-skill players**

I think it's fair to generalize that these are the youngest players. This is also the largest constituent of the player base. These players mostly have lots of time and energy on their hands. While Epic may think that it is a wise decision to cater to these players, I argue that catering to these players has no effect on their interest in the game. *These are the players who play the game for the enjoyment of video games and for the hype of Fortnite. They are not invested in the metagame and will continue to play regardless of how a patch may cater to them or may further increase the skill gap*.

By promoting ""inclusiveness"" Epic makes cancerous changes. With changes like these, low-skill players may see an increase in performance, without actually improving their gameplay. Without getting too philosophical, this sort of instant gratification is a plague on society and caters to our inner dopamine fiend. Changes like this are unhealthy because they teach (1) you don't have to invest to improve yourself because (2) the system will shift in your favor.

What ever happened to ""hard work pays off"". We've become so far removed from delayed gratification and being rewarded through hard work. This patch is the participation trophy of Fortnite.

**For mid-tier players**

This is the demographic I consider myself to be a part of. Due to past gaming experiences, I have good aiming mechanics and am a quick learner to pick up on new gameplay concepts such as building. In Fortnite, us mid-tier players understand that we're not the best in the game and that we'll still take our L's against players who are definitively worse than we are, but we know that we can elevate our gameplay by developing our core gameplay skills (building) and becoming better at decision-making.

Season 5 frustrates us because it's increasingly more difficult to separate ourselves from the bottom of the barrel when the meta favors RNG. There is now a reduced effect of improving our core gameplay mechanics because of this shift towards RNG. It's also difficult to improve our game-time decision making because there are so few ways to outplay the spam metagame. Even when you watch pro-level players, they have hard time adapting to the new meta in *solos* (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/91krci/06\_kd\_player\_with\_p90\_vs\_top\_tier\_pro\_player/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/91krci/06_kd_player_with_p90_vs_top_tier_pro_player/))

It's frustrating to see that our efforts in elevating our gameplay can be smacked down with this sort of shift in the metagame to appeal towards lower-skill players. It also frustrates us to hit this wall in improvement beyond ""beginner gains"" and I for one, have begun to lose interest. We are still a significant part of the player base, and to use a metaphor, we are the ""swing states"" in US presidential elections.

**For pro-level players:**

While it is a fact that many pro players dislike this shift in the metagame and have also found it difficult to counterplay in the new metagame, these players have solid Fortnite IQs which helps them establish early game superiority which puts them in strong positions to close out the game, despite having an increased chance in being knocked out by worse players.

However, most of these pro-level players are also content creators or contributors and I don't see them leaving the game anytime soon.

**Possible solutions:**

Some solutions I've seen from various sources.

1. SMG nerf across the board, whether its accuracy, damage, damage against buildings. I think we can all agree this is a must.
2. If gunplay is the new focus on Fortnite, then replace bloom with recoil patterns.
3. Make shotguns viable again. With how much building has been nerfed and how much SMGs have been buffed, even if pumps could deal 200+ damage AND double-shotgun was restored AND pump switch delay was removed, shotguns would still be less effective than SMGs currently.
4. Make building effective again. Building was a core mechanic and allowed so many opportunities for outplay. The nerf to health and the buff to SMGs/splodes took that away. This was effectively a double-nerf
5. Introduce a competitive/LTM playlist to test these experimental changes and their effects on competitive gameplay rather than test against the entire player base.

**TL;DR excluding solutions:**

Due to the hype of Fortnite, I consider the extremes (skill-level wise) of the player base to be static in the sense that these players will continue to play regardless of the shifts in the metagame. However, a still significant part of the player base (mid-tier players) will lose interest and discontinue playing because it is (1) more difficult for us to outperform low-skill players due to shift towards RNG and (2) it is more difficult to improve our gameplay when there are so few viable playstyles and limited opportunities for outplay.

**Materials**

* Materials capped at 750/750/750
* Wood wall goes from 80 to 200 HP in 10 seconds (12 HP/s)
* Stone wall goes from 80 to 350 HP in 15 seconds (18 HP/s)
* Metal wall goes from 80 to 500 HP in 20 seconds (21 HP/s)
* Increase Wood harvesting rates by 1.25x compared to what they currently are
* Increase Stone harvesting rates by 1.75x compared to what they currently are
* Increase Metal harvesting rates by 2.25x compared to what they currently are

**Reasoning**  
Obviously, we never asked for mat caps. But let's be honest, we rarely farm Metal, and Stone not so much. So what if we raise the incentive to farm these, by making them quicker to farm and stronger structures, but slightly nerf the mat caps? 2250 maximum mats is still a lot, and plus, it's better for the OCD of being 1 mat away from another structure after having hit 999 and placing something.

**Weapons**

* Vault LMG
* Decrease AR bloom by 25%
* Decrease Burst AR bloom by 50%
* Increase Burst AR structure damage by 30%
* Decrease headshot multiplier for SMG, Drum Gun and Compact SMG to 1.5x
* Add structural damage drop-off to SMG, Supressed SMG, Drum Gun and Compact SMG (won't specify precisely, but quite intense drop-off)
* Remove pull-out animation from the Pump Shotgun and Heavy Shotgun
* Remove delay between shotguns when switching to a Tactical Shotgun (but not a Pump Shotgun or a Heavy Shotgun)
* Increase Pump Shotgun damage from 80-85 to 85-90 (but keep headshot multiplier at 2x)
* Increase Heavy Shotgun damage from 73.5-77 to 74-78
* Increase Tactical Shotgun damage from 67-70-74 to 69-72-75
* Decrease the radius of AoE damage on explosives by 50% (including Remote Explosives) and make the range the same for both damage to players and damage to structures

**Reasoning**

* The LMG is in a very weird spot right now amongst all the spam weapons, and doesn't feel right, nor is it viable compared to a Drum Gun or P90.
* ARs are currently a bit less useful, since Supressed SMG's seem to be more accurate and better at taking down structures. Let's help them out by making them more accurate, so their role as a greag mid to long-range weapon can be more established.
* If ARs have been forgotten, what about Burst ARs? They basically never get used at this point, because they're simply worse for taking down structures, and they're not as accurate as we'd like them to be. So let's give them a sweet accuracy buff, and slightly improve their structural damage.
* SMGs are crazy right now, and definitely need some sort of control. Even without headshots they melt, so having headshot multipliers of 2x make them even worse. This should be reduced on all weapons except the Suppressed SMG, which isn't as much of a spam weapon, as it also has FSA. However, I think all SMGs could use a major structural damage nerf, since right now they just melt your builds in seconds, especially the P90.
* I believe they should remove pull-out animations on the Pump and Heavy, since they've already got the swap delay on them. However, I believe the swap delay should be removed when switching to a Tactical Shotgun, allowing for much more variety in close quarters combat and bringing back double shotguns to some extent, but not double Pump oe Heavy.
* I also believe that shotguns could all use some damage improvements, since most of the time, unless 100% of your crosshair is on the person (which isn't too easy, especially with a Tac or Pump), you won't deal the full damage. This will bring them back on par with SMGs in close quarters combat, and create a whole variety of play styles and combinations. The weapon that I decided needs the biggest buff is the Pump, since it has fallen behind. Making the base damage of the Pump much more noticeably higher than that of the Heavy or the Tac, whilst still keeping the Heavy's headshot multiplier at 2.5x, makes the Pump a more desirable weapon.
* Explosives clearly give a huge advantage currently, especially in late-game. This advantage is slightly too much at the moment, so halving the AoE radius on all explosives should help.

I have no will to grind anymore because there's no way to counter any of the things I'm dieing to. The only game mode I win at now a days is solo. Me and my squad do win some maybe 2/10 but not like before where we'd win 4/10.

I want to open up a discussion. I'll keep these very concise. I'm just looking to balance the weapons in the game to fit their role and reward good building/farming.

SMGs:
1. Hard damage cutoff values. These guns supposed excell at close range? OK, then after 50m, they should do ZERO damage. After 30m, fall off should be to around 45-50%.
2. Clip size should not exceed 30 on any SMGS

Shotguns:
1. Remove swap delay
2. Damage PERCENTAGE minimum values. No more days of 9 damage. If I hit you, even if it's in the toe, at minimum I should do 30% damage, 50% with heavy and pump. So if you have 200hp and I get a hit marker, anywhere, that's 60-100HP. If you are 50 health, that turns to 15-25HP. If I hit for more than 40% of pellets, I do 60% of the max damage of the shotgun, and if I hit for over 80% of the pellets, I do max shotgun damage. 
3. Shotguns can have hard damage falloff as well, after 30-50m they do ZERO damage.

ARs:
1. Will be back to normal with a hard damage cutoff for SMGS

LMG:
1. Will have its role back with hard damage cutoff for SMGs 
2. Do more damage to structures.

Structure damage:
1. Hard damage cutoff values apply to structure damage as well, perhaps with a bit of tweaking in addition.

Metal:
1. Should have the opposite of what happened to it and the rest of materials, it should have a higher initial placement HP, like 80% making it more valuable if you're getting spammed.
2. Should block all explosive damage to other surrounding pieces, like before the explosives buff.

Brick:
1. Should have higher placement HP as well, in between metal and wood.
2. Should block half the explosives damage to other surrounding pieces.

TLDR: 

Damage minimum percentage values for Shotguns and hard damage cutoff values at distance for SMGs would help them fit in their roles better and bring back the viability of the ARs and LMGs.

Material placement HP should be closer to 100% for metal and like 75% for brick. Brick and metal should be buffed overall.

SMGs should receive a significant environmental damage nerf (something like 50-60%). This would limit the versatility of the currently broken Compact SMG and give players a little bit more of a reason to consider picking up the Drum Gun,  LMG, or Mini gun

2. The Compact SMG should have at most a 35 round magazine. I think that this combined with the nerf mentioned above would make the Compact SMG a tolerable weapon to fight against.

3. C4 should be changed to Epic rarity, dropping Stink Bombs to Rare in exchange. They should drop in groups of either 2 or 3, with the max a single player can hold being 5.

You see a fellow black knight and u engage in a spectacular build fight. Both of u are amazing builders and ur editing and gaining and losing high ground constantly. All of a sudden he stops building and tries to box but u shot gun down his wall and he dies.  U loot him but he only has 8 wood left and no healables. Never the less u slowly build and edit down triumphant. Another player approaches a no skin.... but he is a fake!  He double ramps with floors and walls and u build up to block him with some pyramids and regain ur high ground Another righteous build battle... but no! You are low on mats... you box and he spams u with AR... but u spam turbo build and he is thwarted.... He spams u spam he spams... 2 highly skilled players both skillfully spamming skillfully.... until u run out of mats and die... All the while someone is using a silenced smg to shred the build at the bottom.  Because now everyone knows that 3rd partying is the best way to get late game kills. And the fake no skins falls to his death. 

This is an outrage! The game is becoming a mat farming simulator! I want more action! I don't want to farm.mats all day or lose fights just because I farm less mats than some sweaty no life. This game is gonna fail because it's just about who can farm the most mats and it's so boring etc etc. If only epic made it possible for me to win fights when I was low in mats or to win fights quicker...

Back to reality. Previously there was no counter to building other than building. Splodes were next to useless. If u ran out of mats u were done for. The player base gets better more people learn to build well. Instead of 5 good builders being in a lobby. (Season 3) now there are 20-30.... they all know how to build. They all know how to 3rd party. Plus there are another 10 players that are watching streamers 4 hours a day and know that the builder gods are most vulnerable when they are distracted. Big long build battles were cool but honestly so wasteful and next to useless for actually winning in a competitive lobby. Building had to be nerfed or the game would have become extremely 1 dimensional. It's not just catering to casuals it's catering to everyone that is low on mats or wanting more action. Less mats needed per fight means u can take more fights. Building is still incredibly strong and separates the truly competitive from the rest. U have to build smart now.... Building high and fast isn't enough anymore.

The point of this is not to say that all the changes are correct. I think they have went over board with some of the changes and some should be dialled back. I m just sick of reading that epic are obviously catering to casuals.  Most of these changes had to happen and most have had a  good effect on the overall balance of the game.

Let us create a different approach together for Epic to consider.","The recent changes have been aimed to kill the turtle meta, but have end up backfiring and hurting the overall state of balance.     

Current problems we have:  
*SMGs - High fire rates too high, can shoot through builds and knock aggressive rampers too quick   
*Explosives - Break too many mats for little to no cost of danger, spammable
*Mat Nerfs - Placement HP lowered, Max HP lowered, allows almost all weapons to shoot down quickly, even bursts now.  
  
Epic is obviously approaching this the wrong way as it's not only hurting turtles but other playstyles as well. We need to come up with different solutions that don't impact other playstyles and nerf turtles as well. I think a great example of a direction to take is items like the stink bomb, an AOE item that forces turtles to move or take damage.  
  
Suggestions:  
*Wall Jacker(Grenade type similiar to boogie) - Creates a large AOE zone where all of your opponent's buildings becomes yours. This causes the turtle to essentially trap themselves as you now have the ability to edit any walls, floors, roofs and even place traps. The opponent's only choice is to shoot their way out. (I don't think this effects other play styles as it requires you to be in range of the piece to edit.)  
*Remove turbo building(Unpopular change however) - Since the introduction of turbo building gameplay has changed significantly, people can just hold down a button and instantly create a 1x1, easily double ramp, and easily place the same wall over and over again. It's made the game significantly easier as you can just move your mouse around and overbuild your way to safety.  
*EMP Grenade - A large AOE effect where nothing can be built, causes all players to have to reposition if they want to continue building, or force them to work with what they have already placed.

That first paragraph might seem like some unnecessary fluff, but I say it because I’m one of the subscribers here who really kind of sits between being okay at the game and being good but has a desire to get better. Many of you may have been in my position before, I would imagine. All of this seemingly random exposition is going somewhere, I promise.

But then I started thinking about the heart of what this person was getting at - the P90 is so goddamn strong that we need a veritable supernatural force to be able to compete with it. I started checking the comments, and there were people, again, on the **main sub**, who said verbatim “I’d take the double pump over this shit”. 

Think about that. Rarely (if ever) do players in the main sub agree unanimously with this sub. Moreover, the devs and PR guys for Epic actually check that sub. So if even they’re getting tired of the P90 already, then there may be hope for it getting tweaked or removed. I’d prefer the latter if it came down to a this-or-that scenario. I used it literally one time on my lunch break and absolutely stomped everyone who came my way. And this is me we’re talking about, not some pro. I shudder to think how they’d fair with it.

Have you ever heard a pro complain on a gun nerf on every patch they read? No, because they will adapt. That's why this sub is not in well shape. 

When they added guided missiles, people complained. I don't want to be that guy, but the guided missile was easily countered if you was somewhat skilled. The guided missile was not op at all(for me and many others), the reason why they removed it was because it was very op against players who couldn't build well. Which is maybe 85% of the playerbase. 

When I joined this sub I expected above average players to be around here, but the only players I can see is complainers and if you dig deep you can find 1 or 2 posts with good competitive thoughts. 

And now the c4. I can agree that it was op before the nerf today. But what made me write this looong post is that guy I saw in this sub complaining about the new c4 patch. The reason it is still op according to this guy is that ""it can still take out my buildings when a player places multiple c4's. Oh my....

Fortnite is not all about building, builders. Either you adapt like a real player, or you make a frustrating ""nerf this shit"" post on @FortniteSuggestion

But seriously I can't blame you guys. This is epic's fault and there's alone.

But hey let's try to be positive and list what needs to happen to get the game back on its feet

1. Obligatory major nerf to smg's especially the new compact smg

They need to do a little less damage to players and way less effective against builds

2. Pump buff - remove switch delay or revert damage nerf so you can 1 pump again

Both could happen but I fear it may be OP? I really don't know (need some input

3. Explosives nerf - revert the buff to the area of effect

For example a RPG shouldn't destroy and a double ramp wall combo

Idk when this change was made but it needs to be reverted to how it was season 1 to 3 (maybe 4? Can't remember)

And in turn the ammo cap should be increased

4. AR buff - tighten up bloom

5. This one is controversial but I think a max materials cap with 2x harvesting rate could be a good change

I think an LTM with this change to explore if it's viable needs to happen

I'm by no means an advanced player. I'm average at best. I have a 4% win rate and a 2.0 K/D. Essentially, I'm pretty much the sort of person EPIC are trying to cater to with these updates.

It feels like for me, that EPIC are trying to develop a competitive scene, whilst reducing the skill gap to encourage recreational (for the rest of this post, recreational would refer to beginner, below average, and some average players) players to keep on playing the game. IMO, this is not how they should develop the competitive scene.

Recreational players (myself included) don't enjoy playing this game when they die in the first 20% game after game, because they run into an advanced player building like they're on adderall, and then double pumping them on sight. There were periods in Season 3, and 2 where that felt like the case. In the current meta, I'm finding it much easier to get 5+ kill Solos (something I could never do in Season 2 &amp; 3).

Personally, I am having the most fun playing this game since I started in Season 2. My K/D has gone from 1.32 at the start of season 4, to 2.01 as I write this post. My Win % has also doubled in the same time - I think that's all down to EPIC reducing the skill gap. In my opinion, they need to keep adding these updates to reduce the skill gap to encourage new players to play the game. Better players will for sure win less games, and most likely, enjoy the game less (because we all play to get kills, and win games).

However, I feel like now it's come to a point where the skill gap is so close in the regular playlists, that a permanant ""Competitive"" playlist should be introduced, where some of the 'high skill' metas are re-introduced that encourage quick building, or very intelligent plays. I feel like this is the only way that they will build the competitive scene to be something that the recreational players want to watch. In the current Meta, it's hard for the best players to battle it out, because the skill gap is so close, that the RnG elements of the game will take over, and you'll need to have a much bigger sample size to determine the true 'best' players.

If they introduce a Competitive playlist, where building is encouraged, materials are plentiful, and gunskill is rewarded (i.e no bloom), then I believe it would result in a game where the top 1% of players players will be dominant over the 1-2% players. This is how it should be in a competitive environment, which encourages those players in the 1-2% cateogry to practice and up their game.

Anyway, this has turned into a bit of a long one.

Tl;Dr - The skill gap has become so close now, that I (an average at best player, so please take my opinion as such) believe it's time for a competitive playlist which rewards high skill gameplay.

How do people feel about this?

But some people seem to have the wrong idea.","Disclaimer: As the title states I‘m absolutely not a fan of the spam meta, especially the P90. This patch enhanced that meta and I‘m definitely against that. 

Now let‘s begin.

1) There will always be a meta. Be it the AR-Meta we had at the very start when basically anything besides them was useless besides one-pumps. Be it the double-pump meta that or now the spam meta. There will always be something too strong in the game and not everybody will like it. 

2) These significant nerfs were all made after first public competitive events, the EU Duo Qualifiers being the most prominent one. After the mess it was they started with nerfing mats ( looking back at the mat-cap fiasco we had when they announced their future nerfs and plans regarding mats ). They are nerfing building due to how competitive Fortnite was played. Building was overpowered, everybody camped and every game ended with a heal-off or a complete mess of an end fight between 6-10 teams. 

3) Nerfing Building was a requirement for competitive Fortnite. But the way they are currently trying to do that is inherently wrong. The SMGs are too strong ( Drum Gun included ) while Shotguns are too weak. Building was so important due to the nature of shotgun fights. If they revert the changes with the pump delay and give it an insta-kill option while also decreasing the damage from smgs against buildings they would drastically improve their current meta. On top of that they have to work on the format of their competitive formats. Winning should be important but not be on par with 1-3 kills. The scoring system of the SS Week 2 was very interesting ( Maybe decrease the Bonus Points for milestones from 20 to *placeholder number* ).

4) Competitive and Casual should be 2 different Game-Modes. The Casual one should allow for more build fights to happen - Make it fun! 
The Competitive Playlist should have nerfed building, nerfed shotguns, nerfed smgs, etc. - Make it more than „just build lol“! 


TL;DR: Building is nerfed due to Competitive Events Epic spectated in the last few weeks. While they change the game way too drastically and in all the wrong ways, they are on the right path to making Competitive more fun - Turtling isn‘t fun; Camping isn‘t fun. ",FortniteCompetitive

It took me a little back and forth and more time than I thought but where I was originally going with my first post was to see how much damage you can do with a SMG type weapon over a shotgun. With the new P90 whipping out 460 DPS you only need to hit half your shots to kill someone at 200 health which made my bottom line of this post/data pretty simple. 

Some things I noticed:

* Scar and Drum gun are comparable when it comes to DTS per clip, I would argue Scar is better to structures at any range while drum gun could be a more viable option close range. The drum gun has no FSA, I don’t use it as an AR replacement. 

* IMO, with the Semi Sniper Buff I see no reason to have 3 rarities of the Bolt and they should take legendary bolt out. 

* Shotguns are the only weapon type to have fall off damage to structures. The Heavy shotgun is the only shotgun to not be somewhat good against structures since they are not nerfed to structures. All other weapons do not have fall off damage to structures. 

* The mini gun does 45/47 headshot damage with 11 fire rate, does not have fall off damage, and is has buffed damage to buildings

Rip building with the new update new building material now: Stone/Metal.

I uploaded some of my testing of guns and building to my channel if you want to see them: [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/MadeItToTheUsaHD/videos). (I know some of the starting timers were not all set to 00, was a copy paste error idk) 

Metal max health was not changed at the time of this post it is still 500 max HP on xbox. 

* Does anyone else feel using bounce pads to jump 4 tiles vertically is just as cancer as the jetpack in its current state? I would like them to change it to 2.5 tiles vertically and remain it's power horizontally or when placed on a ramp. 

Enjoy, leave feedback and let me know if anything needs to be changed.

The SMG/Splodes spam meta has crippled building in many ways. This patch, Epic buffed the spam meta significantly. 

Many players have been on the verge of quitting, and for many this patch was the straw that broke the llama's back (poor llama). I've already seen multiple posts of players declaring that they're quitting the game, and the scary part is, I can't blame them.
With the nerf to mat health, and the newest SMG, building against spam is going to be damn near impossible in modes outside of solos.

With this newest patch, positioning is everything. Try to use natural terrain for cover if it's available since a wall being placed to block SMG spray will be destroyed in so little frames it's basically instant.

Main changes I want to see made:

1. Shotguns being buffed significantly.

 The newest SMG is rumored to do around 320 DPS. If this is true, in shotty range you'll die in less than a second(about 0.65 seconds so nearly half a second, a second if you miss half of your shots).

There's absolutely no reason for pumps to not be able to one shot if that's the case, as well as removing the redundant slow pull out time that it has. This would also call for the heavy being buffed so it could one shot as well. 

2. Explosive damage radius. 

Explosives should do less damage on the outer parts of the explosion. There's no reason why it should be possible to destroy Trump Tower with a single stack of C4(4). Period. 

3. Buff ARs

Assault Rifles are in the weakest spot that they've ever been in. Buffs to accuracy are needed. There's no reason why an SMG should be prefered over an AR in AR range. 

4. Buff Pistols

There's basically 0 reason to use any of the pistols. A legendary silenced pistol gets shat on by even a grey SMG. They use the same ammo type so this shouldn't be the case. Literally 0 reason to pick up pistols unless they're on of the first items you pick up. 

Deagle and revolver bloom should be decreased significantly or removed all together. Daequan had a projectile idea that I really liked. 


I feel like this post is long enough so I'll leave it at that. I love Fortnite, so I'm going to try my best to adapt to these changes, but I hope Epic listens to what we have to say and adjusts the meta to a more healthy state. What are your opinions on the new changes?",FortniteCompetitive

**Pros:**

Playground mode is back, better than ever

Supply drops seem to have changed for the better (more launchpeds, meds etc).

""Sprint By Default"" has been added (along with other QOL changes)

""Phasing through walls"" has been changed, making it more likely to get bumped to the other side.

**Cons:**

Building starting health nerfed

Metal max health increased

**Note worthy:**

Crouching is no longer allowed while emoting.

The Wave emote, emoticons, and sprays will now continue to play even if you’re moving.

I don't see them having removed ""ghost peeking"" in the patch notes, gotta try it out.

My point is that the pro scene epic is trying to balance the game is ruining the game for others that are not pro. By that i don't mean they are not balancing for noobs. I am talking about the explosive buffs, smg buffs which prevent turtling in scrims. But in normal games where there are no 20 people alive in the last circle, the buffs are ruining the game for everyone , even if you are a pro. The rocket and GL are very spammy and annoying. Now they have added a new SMG and lowered structure health. To encourage less turtling in scrims. It's actually very scary, i would rather not have a competitive scene than having the game ruined because of it. 

I am hoping they revert the explosive changes and still have the ammo cap. Reduce the SMG structure damage only, and add a little more bloom to it

I did not see enough of the recent SS winner to rank him.

Gronky, Upshall and Nickmercs are 3 players of 3 completely different playstyles and while many people say that Nickmercs isn't top notch I would like to say that these 3 are my TOP players. They're all the best at the way they play.

Gronky is very very good technically and mechanically, he has very good aim and exceptional building. He drops the craziest games all the time and clutches all the time.

I'm sometimes unsure about Upshall but recently he's doing extremely good. He does not play flashy at all but he seems to always make the best decisions and has an amazins game IQ.

I would have left out Nickmercs a month ago but since he made the switch to Builder Pro he now is again my favorite console player, it's so fun to watch him improve in building, right now he is actually really not bad, and his decision making and positioning is just CRAZY. I could easily imagine that he would wreck the two others above. He wins most of his build fights right now (I mean it's not like we still have this 20 story build fights right now) and knows exactly when to back out and how to make the best of any situations. 

What's your take on this?",FortniteCompetitive

To start this post off, I've been seeing a lot of people in the community wonder why the players in their lobbies are getting increasingly better from past weeks or months. Even Myth switched to a new account with this same suspicion. Curious myself I planned on playing 10 games on my main account and 10 on a fresh account and track the statistics of the players in the lobby. Skip to the bottom for a TL:DR and the link halfway down is the in-depth statistics.

Background: I am a decent player, around a 4KD overall and around a 5-6KD in season 5. I have around 250 wins and play pretty frequently. The idea is, if there is SBMM the players in my lobbies will be of higher skill than if I played on a fresh account given that I have good stats. What I did was enter lobbies then leave and go into the replay and get as many names as I can from the player list. I put them all into a spreadsheet which will be linked further down (with the usernames redacted) and gathered the stats of each of them over the games.

I ended up doing only 3 games per account, but had the evidence continued to suggest SBMM by an extremely large margin I would have done all 10. If there is a large outcry for me to do this over a much larger sample size I would be happy to do so.

The results: On my main account the average K/D was around 0.98 and the average amount of wins was 37, on the new account the average K/D was 0.76 and the average amount of wins was 25. There were around 66 players on my main account that had a K/D above 1 and on the fresh account there were about 39 with a K/D above. There were 54 players on my main account with 0 wins while my fresh account had 70 players with 0 wins. The spreadsheet with the in-depth statistics is here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WoBCJDfmNmXKpX0VA53\_3tBYBfDNdqfatktq7ujYcNY/edit#gid=0](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WoBCJDfmNmXKpX0VA53_3tBYBfDNdqfatktq7ujYcNY/edit#gid=0)

this includes Overall KD, S5 KD, Wins, and Win%, alongside my stats. I have a version that includes usernames as a way to prove these are legitimate stats.

While there are slight differences there isn't enough differentiation to claim that there is an form of SBMM, my games on my main account were still grouped with the same types of players that I was on my fresh account. I used Fortnitetracker for this and I know the flaws that come with that but this is the best I can do with the resources I have.

TL:DR- Looked at the stats of a ton of people and there is not enough evidence to suggest SBMM, if there is a large outcry I will perform this test again over a much larger sample size as to add more legitimacy but i do not think the results will change. I hope this helps people come to the conclusion of whether or there is SBMM in this game. And a final note, huge shout out to my friend codfish who is responsible for all of the amazing work on formatting the spreadsheet and helping organize the spreadsheet. He also helped with a \*little\* of the work looking up players.

Currently, Myth is the fortnite team Captain for TSM. TSM recently benched one of their players, Camills and is now looking for a new permanent fourth, Calvin is stepping in as a sub.

However, most of you here know this, so I’ll get straight to the point, I think this new fourth player has to be someone who can overtake the role as Captain on the TSM Fortnite team.

I don’t see Myth fit as a Captain for his team, especially with his recent performances in tourneys and stunts on stream. He’s had an attitude towards his team mates (Hamz rly) that’s not constructive at all. He’s been blaming the game for poor performances and constantly says that he wants to improve, but he makes excuses for not improving.

I think TSM needs a Captain that can grab their necks and throw them into a routine of scrims, practice and team building, because as of now TSM is just a team of brilliant content creators but mediocre players.

They need a fourth that can step up their game, that can critisize them in a constructive way. That’s hard for Myth to do being a 19 year old and with the attitude. If anything, put Hamlinz as a Captain, shot calling is something that can be learned. They need someone who can «save» them, because as of now TSM is not the team they should be, they’re not improving enough.

That’s my 2 cents, feel free to disagree.",FortniteCompetitive

C4 + SMG are dominating the game right now at a stupid level.

Whenever someones tries to initiate a build fight you either get C4'd and fall to death. Or they just SMG spray your buildings until you eventually fall to your death.

Nothing about that strategy is skillful or rewarding.

I feel like the skillgap has definitely been decreased and being a top level builder is no longer a priority when learning this game.

Buildfights are becoming less common and the general skill of the game has decreased. 

I honestly hope a change happens soon because the meta is getting very repetitive/stale right now.

There are a few main reasons for this which I will detail below. Feel free to make constructive arguments but don’t downvote just because my opinion is different from yours. 



1- RNG Based Mechanics-  RNG (manifesting its self as bloom) is a bad part of any competitive game. Take any of the largest Esports today: CSGO, DOTA2, Starcraft 2, there’s one thing that places them at the top of their respective genre for Esports. And that’s the solely skill based nature of the game. Battle Royale games are not suited particularly well to competitive gameplay. With luck dictating loot, your positioning and, in Fortnite specifically (and PUBG to a lesser extent), your ability to hit a target. This is not fun for either the viewer or the player and should be addressed by Epic should they wish to pursue their game as the next CSGO or DOTA2 of gaming. 



2- Material harvesting- I’ll make this one brief. Nobody wants to watch their favourite player hitting trees for minutes at a time, and no player wants to spend their gameplay time hitting things. Increasing material gains or starting with materials may begin to negate this problem, but larger scale changes could prove more harmful than helpful in the long term. 




3- Weapon Balancing- Fortnite is, at its core, a very casual centric game with many parts of the game being balanced around this. As I mentioned before, bloom exists. This system removes the skill based nature of gunplay and leaves only first shot accuracy (FSA as I shall refer to it) as a way to Ben certain of damage. Guns- especially SMGs- are balanced around FSA, with it taking longer or shorter to centre depending on how damaging the gun is. This isn’t healthy and is by no means a fun or competitive aspect of a game, as not many players even bother to utilise FSA, preferring to rush their opponents or just spray and pray. Explosives are also ridiculous. C4 was banned in the first game of Summer Skirmish. And rockets and grenade launcher projectiles dealing 100 plus damage with no warning. It’s fairly obvious something is out of order with these weapons. 





Congratulations if you made it down here. I’ll remind you again to supply counterpoints and arguments in the comments. 

Tl;dr shooting and guns need fixing, materials need changing before Fortnite can flourish as an Esport. ",FortniteCompetitive

TSM Daequan is currently streaming right now and has brought up some interesting points regarding the recruitment of the fourth member (and most likely his future duo partner.)

He considers himself and Myth top 10, whilst he views Ham as top 3. He states he would only be interested in someone who would not only avoid getting smacked by Ham, but also be able to kill him; thus putting the future member on the same level as Myth and Dae.

Furthermore, he is looking for someone who can pubstomp, being able to use an aggressive play style to get as many kills as possible. 

Dae also states that this person should be able to grow themselves outside of Fortnite through twitch and youtube, a hard working person who shows they are grateful for the opportunity.

Finally, they must be compatible in personality due to TSM's growing youtube channel and content that comes from the house.

With all that being said it's obvious that Dae should just clone himself and make his clone the fourth member. In all seriousness, what do you guys think? If a person like that even exists surely TSM's pro team would be on-par with FaZe and Liquid.",FortniteCompetitive

Currently my favorite rotation is landing anywhere in the middle of the map (Salty, Dusty, Lazy), clearing the area, then quickly getting to the rifts near the divot and flying to tilted and landing on either top of apartments or Trump. 

Usually I'm coming out of my landing spot with around 3 kills, then I can fly to tilted and have a solid loadout, shield, and materials.

This strategy also give you a huge advantage over the players who land in tilted because you will usually have high ground and you can often laser them before they can even react.



After I clear tilted I usually just go to wherever the next circle is. The rotation gets me anywhere from 6-15 kills depending on how many people land with me, how quickly I get to the rift, and how many people are still alive in tilted.",FortniteCompetitive

I have a lot of questions/concerns but I'll boil them down as simply as possible. I'll start off with my settings and basic keybinds:

DPI is 600 at .09 sens (this feels extremely slow for me, more on this later)

Crouch-C

Inventory-Alt

Shift-sprint

Q-pickaxe

Mouse buttons- stairs/ramps

X-floor

F-edit

E-use

R-reload

Weapon slot 2 (shotgun slot, the one I need to get to the most in a hurry)- click scroll wheel.

Basically, I suck at kb+m and I've been putting in 3-4 hours a day on this game trying to practice since I made the switch. I've gotten relatively comfortable with these binds but in general I'm not comfortable because I'm learning everything for the first time.

I'm really struggling with the movement system. I have to consciously think about which button to press to turn a certain way and I'm unsure how much I should be picking up my mouse. I don't have a tiny mouse-pad but I don't have a ton of room either. I know using the arm for movement is supposed to be better but it just doesn't feel as natural to turn my whole arm as it does my wrist. I don't know if that makes me a high sens player or if it's just something I must get used to. I know sens/DPI is all preference but I'd love to know if there's a good place to start. 

Right now when I encounter an enemy, my left hand more or less goes brain dead and I have to think about what I want to do instead of just reacting.

My basic questions are:

1. are these binds okay to learn on or will I be handicapping myself?
2. for those who switched from controller, was this at all similar to your experience?

Thanks for taking the time to read this long post, I'm just frustrated with the learning curve right now and want to make sure I'm on the right track.",FortniteCompetitive

So my suggestion is that the structures you're building are coloured blue like normal and the structures the enemy is building should be coloured red/yellow so the second you see that it's not your wall you have a chance to react",FortniteCompetitive

This post is about an aspect of the meta I haven't seen in other post.

Many post are circulating about the current ""spray and pray""-meta, and how no-skill it is. First week of this season I sure had problems to adapt, but lately I've picked up the new SMG and some C4 and carefully choose which fights I'm going into. I do not completely agree on all the ""no-skill""-arguments, well fine it doesn't take any skill to just spray but it's more than that, positioning has become key to perform well in this state of the game. In my opinion the current meta just ain't that fun, and I will address why below.

After reading multiple post about the meta I think we all can agree on that positioning plays a huge part of how well you will do. One thing that's bothering me, is that getting pinched seems to be inevitable, sure you can always reduce the likelihood of getting pinched by playing on the edge of the circle for example. But you can most certainly not eliminate this risk. You can never control how and where other players will land or where they will postition themselves. With that said, there's an RNG aspect of how many players that will be around you to pinch when you engage a fight with someone else. I've been in multiple fights on different areas of the circle, and sometimes theres only 3 teams at the edge of the circle, and sometimes there are like 5 teams. And these teams WILL engage at you when you start shooting someone. To pinch someone last meta, you really had to get into the shit, outbuild your opponent to win, which could be pretty hard relatively speaking, if the ones you pinched were good. But this meta has kind of made it easier to pinch people, because you will get spammed, and spammed. It's hard to defend yourself in those situations and my conclusion of this is that it comes down to how many players are around your area which is kinda RNG and nothing you can control, it doesn't really matter how good you are.

The problem with the meta is that pinching has become so much more viable, and I think many feel like they can't do anything to prevent or fight this. I also do believe we have to talk about these kind of ""problems"" to expose them and develop counterplays to it

How do you guys defend yourself in that situations, lower the risk of getting pinched and what do you think has to be done by the developers to make pinching some kind of hard that it used to be, I also use the pinch-strategy which results in free kills 95% of the time.",FortniteCompetitive

I can see where they are coming from. After the shotgun damage nerf, the max damage difference between the 2 weapons shrank considerably. The pullout delay doesn't make things better. 

But the pump still does considerably more damage then the tac because of the tighter spread. The tac does so little damage in my experience. I have never hit max damage with a tac if the enemy wasn't right up in my face. I like to keep my enemy outside of one build unit so I can build a wall between us if neccessary. At that range the pump can still consistently get 100+ damage. That's why I like to use it still over a tac. But I would still like Epic to remove the delay.  That one is still annoying.

Obviously this is just my Opininion and I understand why someone would feel otherwise. But A lot of people have said that the pump has now become obsolete which I disagree with. What do you think",FortniteCompetitive

However, I've been wondering (these past couple of months, since 'fake no-skins' became kind of a thing) whether it actually helps making life easier and/or get more kills. I've been wondering if people actually underestimate a default skin and rush their decisions, etc.

I then realized that there's no reason to keep pondering about it. I can use myself as an example: every single time I see a default skin these past couple of months, I cannot but subconsciously underestimate them, despite the fact that I'm well aware that they may be fake. It sometimes costs me shield/HP points, at most (in the worst cases, I even die, albeit rarely). This leads me to believe that it's true with everyone else.

It made me realize that being aware of the fact that a fake default skin stands in front of me does not make me stop underestimating them completely. I'm aware they may be fake so I'm not as careless, BUT, in the back of my mind, there's always this 'maybe he isn't faking it, so he might suck.' I do win most of my fights, regardless of skins, and I don't really care which skin I go up against, but there's something about default skins that you can't help it but subconsciously underestimate them. Telling yourself ""I'll treat all skins the same"" doesn't really do the trick.

Hence this thread. This whole thing makes me feel somewhat obligated to run as a default and I've been doing it for a few games now. I'd much rather use my skins, but whether you like it or not, running default skins does have an impact on your enemy, and in your favor. Being extremely high-kill-game hungry, I feel like I would always want to have this edge, and so I feel like I have no choice.

That's one of the symptoms that a person who is trying to improve but distracted by their previous failures. I know he cherish his viewers for supporting him but right now, he's focusing to improve and tries so hard to forget about what happened in the tournament.

But how long should 1 take to try to become pro. In my history of games that i played I always tried to become the best. Now i never took it too serious untill fortnite. Since fortnite is still a fairly new game and the esports scene is still developing. 

Tennpo and joamocks story really motivated me. They both decided to grind for a couple of months trying to become a high tier player. Joamock told his dad that he was going to try it 5 months. If it didnt workout , he would go back to school. Tennpo similair story but he stayed in school while doing it, grinding 12h a day. I blieve in this , its like any other sport. Put in the time to practise, and you will reach your goals

 I understand that not everyone has what it takes to become a pro. I'm just asking where should you put the deadline. How many days/months should the grind take for you to see if you can proceed to pro level. 

I have been playing this game since easter , so im still learning every day. I started with friends for fun, so haven't gotten the chance to play alot of competitive. But i'm going to give it my all for a periode and see how it turns out. 

So intead of playing with friends , focus more on

\- Solo/Solo snipes

\- Focusing on build fights , using playground when it comes out again to perfect you moves.

So long story short : How long should you grind for and where do you put the deadline and accept that it will not work out

Fortnite have made success off of the casual fanbase and it's a good way to introduce people to the game, but they need to realize if they want a somewhat balanced game(which will never happen) the balance should be made around the competitive enviroment

If there's one thing to learn with how league/csgo handle their balancement is that they revolve around the high level players, in both games they have their pubstomp strats that good players know how to counter, its part of the learning process of the game, new players need to PLAY THE GAME and get better to learn how to counter some specific strategy (lets say master yi for league and p90 rush for CSGO so  some players can understand whats my point)

and what epic is doing? they are trying to reduce the skill gap by making it easier for non experienced players to play against good builders, by making it easier and ""fun"" to the new players they are making frustrating to their loyal fanbase who put time and effort learning the fundamentals of the game",FortniteCompetitive

- if the replay system show your gameplay ( from the start till the end ) why did he need to edit his video and skip some kills ?!!!

- 2nd kill + 12 kill + 23rd kill was skipped from the video because it was suspecious that's why he didnt want to exposed.

- some of the players were carrying shields and hiding ( they were one shot ) so obviously when you are one shot and you have 50 shield you will take it instantly when you are hiding.

- i've never rushed someone who has highground ans he knows that im coming and he didnt even try to shoot me down. 

- it was soooooo obvious when he rushed players who were in their bases and instead of shooting him they start building higher and far away from him so idropz can make them fall and die ( fall damage )

- 4 players were in their bases , and when idropz rushes them they gave up easly and went down giving him highground and when he starts shooting them 2 of them were just switching weapons and jumping.

- imagine 15 players of 24 kills didnt even try to shoot him back ( epic i need that lobby right now ) 

- you have to see the video before commenting.

Could use some advice on taking my game from being an ""ok"" player to a good player. I'm an adult with wife/kids/work so I don't have 20 hours a day to dedicate, but I would like to play at a much higher level than I'm currently playing. I've primarily been into single player games for most of my life. Smash Bros Melee and Modern Warfare opened the door to how fun competitive multiplayer could be, but even then, I didn't pay attention too much to my stats or anything like that. 

Destiny really changed that for me with Trials of Osiris. I had accomplished every single PVE goal in Destiny I'd set out to do (solo flawless raider!) and when Trials first launched, I truly wondered if I'd ever set foot in the lighthouse. My PVP stats...weren't good. I was around a .95 k/d. I  started focusing on getting better and not making stupid pushes/decisions. We ended up going flawless numerous times and I raised that K/D to 1.07 (that was playing Trials the majority of the time).  It was a small gain, but I felt good that things were going in the right direction. Destiny 2 hit and I was excited about starting with the fresh k/d. Again, I showed improvement with a Trials k/d of 1.42. 

Fortnite hits and I played casually for a while, but the past couple of months, I've really been focusing on my k/d and trying to improve. I'm currently 1.73 overall k/d and then a 1.95 for season 5. So I do think I'm improving, but I guess I feel like it should be happening faster. I watch a lot of the big streamers, as well as tip videos on YouTube. I've recently been focusing on Nickmercs because of the fact he's on console (I play on PS4) and is known for his excellent positioning. 

I feel like my background in non-competitive, single player games is primarily what's making my improvement slower than I would like. I'm still learning the ins and outs of competitive games/shooters, such as concepts like peeking and how certain angles put you at an advantage or disadvantage with the over-the-shoulder camera. So while I would love to hear your Fortnite specific tips, I'd also appreciate your recommendations for learning multiplayer shooter tactics in general and making sure I'm following the fundamentals.",FortniteCompetitive

I've been testing the ability of two SMG's as a loadout and it works. It seems that Epic's intentions to nerf shotguns have ran them into the ground. Two blue SMG's melts people now and the DPS is enough to counteract both shotguns. The pump delay kills the pump in combat and allows the SMG to melt a pump user even if they manage to hit their first shot. Additionally, the general inconsistency in people's aim has allowed the SMG to defeat tactical shotguns as well. If you get hit with a 7, 21 or even 50, then you can still shred somebody because you have two guns that deal 200+ DPS. 

Another point is that two SMG's allows for ridiculous damage to structures. You can use the first one to shred through whatever you need and switch to the second one for the player. The addition of the new P90 only furthers this meta of not carrying a shotgun. I'm interested to know how long this meta will be kept for and how players will adapt. ",FortniteCompetitive

I worked really hard on this so please read to the end. 

STOP USING DEFAULT KEYBINDS. 

Best tip that i see NO ONE saying nor doing (people might do it but don’t think about it). Ideally you want each building piece to be accessible with a different finger. Example- wall-ring floor-index roof-pinkie stair-mouse button.  Just an example.

Personally I have all of those like that except roof is also index. It’s uncomfortable for me to press z Roof C Wall Q Stair Mouse button specific to g600 Floor E

I think the only exception would be roof and floor on same finger bc usually you use it to add a layer to your 1x1x1. There’s other uses but usually floor and stair aren’t used together as much

I think this would be good. Wall.  Q Tab. Picaxe Ctrl. Map Floor. Mouse button 1 or 2 Edit. F Roof. R or x Snipe or splodes. R or x Reload. Scroll wheel click down Stairs. I don’t have my kb&amp;m next to me so whatever finger is open and comfortable

If you have something that isn’t like the g502, like me, (it’s just the most common mouse for fortnite) use whatever is most comfortable that’s free. If it says mouse button x, it’s best to use a bind on your mouse if possible 

Also you want your edit and floor to be on a different finger so you can do that thing where you ramp up and floor above you. 

Use whatever isn’t used already and is comfortable for your guns. DO NOT USE SCROLL WHEEL. ",FortniteCompetitive

I’m a top player on console, I’ve competed in the Summer Skirmish yesterday ( only got 90 points, kinda fucked it up ) and placed top 100 in previous showdowns etc. 

It’s just, whenever I watch people like Martoz/Mongraal/Chap or any other pro play, I get jealous of how fluid the game and their movements are. It saddens me that I can’t reach that level on console. So recently I’ve been trying to use a mouse and keyboard on my ps4, just to try it out. I discovered I’m an absolute bot when it comes to playing fortnite on mkb and it immedeatly demotivated me to continue playing. 

Now I’m not someone who give up easily, because I just really want to get better. But is it still worth it? It’s going to take so much time and all the tournaments are already starting. 

If there’s someone reading who already made the switch, I’d really appreciate it if you could provide me with some tips or do’s and dont’s.

The first console that I remember it was remotely enjoyable to play an FPS with, was the N64. Although GoldenEye was one of the funnest games I have enjoyed with friends, we never considered it a real FPS game because of the highly inferior control mechanics. We had LAN parties for the real shooters.

Then came the newer consoles and because of their price and accessibility, gaming became popular amongst the casuals. We PC players lost dedicated servers in games amongst many other superior things and became bitter against the console kids. The casual console noobs didn't care to fight for these things as they were finally getting the market share after the PC Master race had ridiculed them for years. They rejoiced when games started to be made for consoles first and ported to PC later although it came with P2P matchmaking and other absolute garbage. They sticked with the shitty controllers and tried to improve upon them, knowing full well that such an input method could never catch up to KB&amp;M. Some consoles tried to introduce M&amp;KB support, but it never really catched on with any game developer, making it irrelevant, until now.

Fast forward to today and because of EPIC's massive success and a firm decision to support KB&amp;M on the console that has the largest market share, we are now finally seeing the M&amp;KB making it's way to the consoles. The resistant is always great with a change, but I believe that change is inevitable and most importantly GOOD. The differences between a console and an entry level computer are diminishing. Perhaps one day, we can all be in the same lobby with the same input methods.

People have defended console and I have seen the analogy that console skill level is 3-7 and pc skill level is 1-10, and whilst I think that is a good analogy it isn’t perfect.

But one thing that pretty much everything agrees on is that there IS a difference. Whether it is that console is harder because aim assist allows noobs to get shots off or whether pc is harder because you run into gods much more often who take your time away from getting other kills, pretty much everyone agrees that there is a difference.

And there is no way to quantify that difference. Everyone’s anecdotal evidence will have inherent bias towards the platform they prefer and no data will tell us definitively which is easier to get kills on.

So, by EPIC placing these two platforms in the same $500k tournament, it hurts the competitiveness of the game as one has an advantage (albeit we don’t know which one or by how much), and with this money on the line and EPIC trying to build a fanbase that cannot be the case.

Overall, Epic has to separate the platforms IF they are not playing on private servers, to preserve the fairness of future tournament.",FortniteCompetitive

It just can't happen. They are two different platforms. As a PC player, you have the option of facing another opposing streamer which outnumbers console players nearly 100 to 1. Let alone, you have the possibility to face another tournament player. This does not happen on console, it is unfair, if console players want to play in tournaments - they must queue into PC and only PC.

You cannot be taken seriously choosing to build your esports like this. The level of gameplay is different, the level of everything is different. It's simply easier, there's nothing else to say about it.

H1Z1 veteran but I was not very good

I only have 54 wins despite being able to pretty much wipe wherever I land consistently.

Do about 1 hour of Aimbooster/3dAimtrainer per day.

What I've begun to realize as I'm losing fights is that I tend to focus more on the player's movement than my own crosshair placement, and sometimes end up completely ignoring it altogether. While doing sites like Aimbooster I go for 100% accuracy and pay very close to my crosshair placement to ensure this. In CSGO I constantly did aim train maps and never had this issue.

I have so many replays where I completely ignore the crosshair and end up doing close to 60 damage with a tac or pump when I should be one-shotting them. When I focus on my crosshair I do better, but I feel like the rest of my game decreases in quality.

TL;DR How do I focus more on where I'm aiming without slowing down my usual aggressive pace?

But at its heart the conversation is “does this input scheme provide an advantage against the rest of the lobby?” And to me a scuff and a KBM setup both have the answer of “Yes.”

Let me add that there is obviously a huge difference between a scuff and KBM, especially the mouse.  You can simply aim faster and more precisely with a mouse than joysticks. 

I like Nick Mercs and I subscribe to him, and I know that there is no removing scuff and elite controllers at this point. But having those extra buttons makes a huge difference over the 95% of the player base who do not. You can do more while building and you can jump and weapon swap without taking a thumb off the sticks.  With the double shotgun or shotgun tac meta this is huge.  

One of my favorite things about playing on console historically has been that it feels like an even playing field, you don’t need a $8,000 rig to compete.  I feel like I’m decent at the game but not having those extra buttons sometimes limits my ability to be among the best players.  In this game, there are just too many essential buttons for a standard controller. 

So please share your thoughts on scuffs and if they provide an advantage for players over the 95% not using them. 

If you do support scuffs, what are the furthest things from a standard controller we should allow on console? ",FortniteCompetitive

In the current meta, pinching players or playing “cleanup” post-fight is super common. This has heavily incentivized getting kills WITHOUT TAKING DAMAGE. If you finish a fight and maintain your health, the next fight you aren’t at a disadvantage. And patience is the biggest part of this. Seriously. I can’t tell you how many people needlessly rush me when I have the high ground and immediately get killed, or take the high ground on me and then drop down looking for me. And, in either scenario, even if they kill me, I often get a lot of damage off on them. So I’m going to walk through both scenarios. 

1. You have the high ground on someone, they’re hiding in a structure. From current position, the odds of them killing you are very low. If you drop to their level, the odds of them getting a lucky shot are much higher. They are already turtled in and oriented to their surroundings, you are losing height and giving them a natural advantage. 95% of players have little to no patience. Chill on your high ground for a few seconds. You’ll start thinking “damn I’m bored I want this kill,” but so will they. And they will move. They may not push you. They may try to run. But as soon as they expose themselves, you have your chance. This also allows you to maintain a full field of view for that rust lord pushing to pinch, meaning that he will actually have to fight to take the high ground because you won’t already be down low. Not to mention, in my experience, most decent players won’t try to push if you have established significant high ground, but will always charge if you choose to drop low searching for a kill. 

2. You got outbuilt/outplayed/spammed out/sploded down. It sucks. Especially the last two. A lot of people angrily swing around and start ramp rushing back to the high ground, often leading to your own death. There are obviously some scenarios you must push (damn you grenade launcher). But if you are in the middle of the old structures from a build fight, sit. Wait for a minute. Often, the opponent will completely ignore #1 and drop down for you. In this case, you can shoot him before he finds you, or edit out and push back to the top as soon as he drops down to look for you, flipping positions with him (my favorite play). If he chooses not to drop for you, often Player 3 will enter the game and go for the “pinch” play. This gives you a distraction to disengage or push to the top and secure your kill. 

Obviously, these tips don’t always work. Sometimes the storm or other factors prevent these from being viable strategies. As always, use your best judgement. ",FortniteCompetitive

Here are my extremely average stats for season 5. My solo stats are horrible because i literally bombed more than half my top 3 situations and other stuff that are out my control but technically in my control(constant freezes because i dont have enough RAM ). 

All my squad and duo games has been with my console friends from school. They hold their own pretty well against the PC sweats in build offs and such and i dont have to ""carry"". They all use builder pro and while they never out built me (playground) they win most of their build battles against probably the ""sweats"" in the lobbies.

Is the skill gap between console really that vast. I know the best console players cannot beat the best PC players and im aware that console lobbies is filled with more ""noobs"". But i believe the whole console vs pc, KB/M on console thing is blown out of proportions. Its only really a problem if the highly highly skilled and pros start using it for tourneys and stuff.",FortniteCompetitive

I just spent a couple hours last weekend thinking about what kind of knowledge that the community seems to be missing, or if there's any information out there at all that is not that well-known.

[Here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fr6DQ7v6y8), (only 5 minutes long) and let me know if you found it useful!

**If you guys don't have much time to watch the video, here's a quick summary:**

1st Trick: Getting down from high structure, FAST. (not bouce pad or window glitch). Great for countering people who shoot down your build.

2nd Trick: Creating a double ramp (one above you and one below you) without having a box around you.

3rd Trick: Counters roof tactic, jump to the side and place a floor! Good for outpacing your opponent.

**------------------------------------------//**

To my knowledge, FaZe Jaomock has been practicing the last trick a few weeks ago, and he wanted to get it down as it could be super effective in a roof-meta like we have now.

I just wanted to do my part and give back to the community where I could, and I think these 3 building tricks (not super well-known imo) could help a few people out improve at Fortnite.

The lack of building means fights are a lot faster, and gives an even greater advantage to the good players since it is possible to learn to build on a console but it takes longer.

Faster fights means more opportunities to get kills.

If console players wanted to use KB&amp;M, they would play on PC. Only reason someone would use KB&amp;M on console is because they know it gives them an unfair edge, obviously not in Epics eyes though.

Also, a question for Epic, why even involve console if you are forcing KB&amp;M onto console players to be able to compete at the highest levels? Why not make it PC only?

https://smash.gg/tournament/red-bull-rise-till-dawn/details


Scoring:

Finish 1st: 10 points

Finish 2nd: 9 points

...

Finish 10th: 1 point

Each Elimination: 1 point

Eliminating Ninja or his teammate: 5 points each

Teams are split into 2 groups (Group A &amp; Group B) &amp; play 3 games and then switch until dawn)

Above all this will be a good showing of how a more advanced scoring system can work for Fortnite's competitive scene.  I think you will see much more fast-paced play and less turtling, especially as the night goes on.

I got around 950 wins and always try to get as many kills possible and work on cetrain things to improve. 

\- *Main weapon*:** MP**5: Fast firing rate, good damage, destroys buildings fast, possibly best mid range weapon

\- *Shotgun*: Tac seemed to be viable after the double pump nerf, but after a few times hitting 20 in a row, I changed back to the old one** pump, its more reliabl**e

Anyhow, if I find a heavy, I instantly trade it, it give you the ability to quickly shoot after you build.

**The combination of one pump/heavy and the mp5 works better for me as the tac, you dont need to be scared to hit him 3 times for 20.**

\- *3rd slot:* Normally I rock sniper and im pretty decent with it, but I felt it slowed me down to much, I saw me getting pinched more ofter if I'm waiting for this dude to peek, miss the shot, peek again and so on. It gives 3rd parties enough time to sandwich you. I still have situation where I thought, damn this guy stands there not moving for a half year and doesnt get punished, then I remembered the time I got pinched because I didnt instantly got aggressiv at someone, to finish the fight as fast as possible. Instead Im using a** scoped A**R, better would be** explosiv**e. Explosive &gt; scoped ar, obviously, its dumbly strong late game. The scoped ar melts people long range, its a good aim training and It gives you the opportunity to shoot him low from distance, then get close to finish him of with the MP5. Anyway, explosive are better for the new camping meta in solos at the end of the game, you need them. 

\- 4th and 5th slots are for healings, If you have only 1 healing item, keep the scoped ar, in case you find C4/rpg/GL.

So this loadout fits for fast paced gamestyle, you want to end the fight as fast as possible so you dont get pinched or have to deal with 10 people in the end zone sitting in the tower and shooting you while you push someone.

Whats your guys loadout?",FortniteCompetitive

1 for suspected mouse and keyboard use.

2 for suspected kill feeding.

As we say in my country everyone has the right to a fair trial. 

Addressing the first point he has already posted a picture of his gaming setup here:

https://mobile.twitter.com/iDropz_Bodies/status/1020438860751409154/photo/1

As you can see there is no keyboard setup nor space for one.

And for the picture floating around where he was asking about a XIM here is the full context 

https://mobile.twitter.com/Richardpaisley4/status/1020501756193591296/photo/1

Whether he was kill feeding is for epic to decide and they can do that as he has the games saved onto his Ps4.

https://mobile.twitter.com/iDropz_Bodies/status/1020480799869734912/photo/1

And for the people using fortnite tracker to accuse him of playing extra games or accusing him of having a PC firstly fortnite tracker is very unreliable and random in the way their games are updated and the PC games played could be through crossplay.

While I can certainly understand skepticism around his gameplay and conduct I do not approve of some comments and the blatant witch hunting of him.

The petty name calling and abuse this sub is giving him is what I’d expect from r/fortnitebr not this sub.

To conclude its best to let epic deal with this as it was their tournament and THEIR money on the line not yours.",FortniteCompetitive

First of all, I don’t think this was a good format for solos. Console and PC are 2 very different platforms and they are fighting for the same thing, generally people would say console players have an unfair advantage. I personally really liked the scoring system and think it would be very good to implement into the Custom servers. If you don’t know the points worked like this-
5 points for Win
1 point per Elim
10 points for 20 kill game
If Epic did something like,
7 Points for Win
1 point per Elim
5 points for over 10 kills
Or something like this, I think it would be very entertaining to watch. (As long as there isn’t insane server lag like last week).

Lastly, just want to address how hard this format was to watch. I really wanted to watch the Fortnite channel but it was really hard to. I really liked the fact that they had Hamlinz come in and game cast, however the other guy (his name is Zeke or something...?) knew absolutely nothing about the game. About midway through the tournament he explained what minis are. Yes you heard me right, MINI SHIELDS, he explained what those were. He basically added nothing and just asked Hamlinz questions. It would be so much more interesting to me to have good game casters (Preferably Dr Lupo and CourageJD) and have them actually cast the game, not just talk. 
Suggestions for Next Week:
-Better Casters (Lupo and courage)
-Make a better point system for Custom matchmaking
-Never do this style again as it is very hard to watch and enjoy, basically just a knockoff worse Friday Fortnite, custom matching making is better 
-It would be cool if you guys added a mini Showdown next week using the same point system as this weeks tournament, and the winner or top players  get into next weeks tournament. (Though I know I’d never get in, it’d be great competition for the community)

What are you guys thoughts/suggestions for next week?",FortniteCompetitive

To improve further, I say they create pools of the players and have them que together.

If they implemented a way for, say, 20 groups of 5 players to startoff and they always que into a game together, first to 50 points advances to the next pool, consisting of winners from other pools, and then you play to find the winner of that pool and so on until 2 players compete for 1st place . 

This way we'd see a higher chance of pros going up against each other late game, with points on the line, and we'd have a better spectator experience, with a way for them to utilize the live replay system.

This idea of course needs to be fleshed out and this is just a quick thought. I'd like to see a better balance between participants going up against each other vs. them going up against randoms.",FortniteCompetitive

So I’ve been contemplating whether I should invest more time into the game, I mean I’m a high school student in summer break, I have all the time that I need to practice and perfect my skills. The real question is, is it still possible? 

As far as my personal ability to play video games at a top level, I was a Global Elite in CS:GO and B+ on ESEA, when I left CS for Overwatch, I got to GM and eventually T500. But I obviously only got to the top by grinding my way up there, I accumulated hundreds and hundreds of hours in these games. 

Very soon I will start streaming myself practicing the game and getting better at it, I’ll probably dedicate 4 hours of my day into the game 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening.., I’m doing it all in one session is because I don’t wanna overwhelm myself at first and get to no where. If I start seeing results I’ll gradually increase the time I play/stream everyday. On top of all of this, I’ll start watching replays to see where I went wrong when I do and how I could’ve done things differently.

What do you guys think? Does it sound like I have a shot at this? I mean my current skill set isn’t bad, but it’s no where near enough to compete just yet. I’m looking for advice here, as well as any criticism you might have.",FortniteCompetitive

First week was a shit show due to server performance and format. So instead of fixing that, and adding this weeks kill incentive to points, they decide on the pubstomp route. Public lobby matches?... for competitive money matching? 

I mean, I can cut like 1/100th of a slice of slack for Epic, because they are seemingly new to the competitive environment, but I really think they need to sit down with the pros and the community and come up with better options... Well, I mean it is kinda obvious what they need to do (custom matches and let orgs handle it) but I'm no expert.

How do you feel about splitting. 

Thinking about it is it fair that console players have to compete against PC Players and Vice Versa? When it might be easier to get a high kill game in Console games than it is in PC because on PC you def have a higher chance of meeting another really good player or Pro / Streamer.

Of course this isn't entirely their fault; the tournament is focused entirely on pub-stomping so unless people happen to encounter another streamer or a good player in one of their games, there is genuinely nothing for casters to commentate on. Yet, when there actually is action happening, they don't commentate any better. They're just yelling ""oooh, close one!"" and ""i think the optimal strategy here would be to rotate to the left, because...."" This isn't entertaining at all. The casters aren't witty, they aren't clever, and they don't know very much about the game (at one point they were discussing whether console or PC was the better platform to play on, and they concluded that ""PC is better for building, but aiming is better on console"").



Spectating is horrendous. The casters just randomly cycle between streamers and just commentate over them. They casted over Parallax while he was casting his game better than they were. This type of tourney is not one that can have a very good spectator mode, though, so the question that must be asked is why did they even choose this style of play to begin with? That's an important question to ask, because an eSport should focus on the viewer experience more than anything else.


There is no place with live (accurate) ranking, so the viewer has no idea who is actually winning. Casters also need breaks, which is reasonable, but having 3 minute gaps in your tournament where players are met with what is literally a rehosted stream on top of a shitty layout is pretty terrible.



tldr: so ya bro sucks big ones. did not 'learn' anything since last tourney. i'd argue this style of tourney is worse for the viewer

My Global Solo Showdown ranking was 177th, and my Blitz Showdown ranking was 121st in North America. The reason I am even bringing this up is because I hope that information shows some validation for people reading this and potentially qualifies me to speak on behalf of the majority of the Fortnite console community, and it doesn’t just make me some angry “non-invited” competitive player. I hope if you are reading this you say in your head “okay this guy at least knows what he’s talking about to some degree.” I play this game for fun, and I enjoy competition. I don’t have the best TRN rankings, I don’t have the most games played, I don’t have the highest KDR. I play this game for fun and that means playing with friends, going for high kill games, solo squads, you name it. However, I feel like this topic needs to be addressed. To those that play the game on different platforms, hopefully you can relate.


Let us get straight into it;


As Epic begins to develop the Fortnite Competitive scene it is becoming abundantly clear that they are alienating, if not at least completely disregarding, the vast majority of their player base. It is no debate that console gamers take up the majority of players on Fortnite. 


When the original Solo Showdown was introduced I was unbelievably excited! A chance to rank as high as possible globally and there was a great incentive; get your name on the leaderboards and a potential to win V-Bucks! The rules were extremely vague, and quite frankly lacking. I quickly realized that the Global leaderboard was cross-platform meaning that instead of playing against the other platforms, your scores competed against cross platform. This means that potentially; the First ranked player in the world could’ve been playing on his phone, and the second could’ve been on PC, and the third could be on console. You can see how this presents a problem. The PC player would absolutely destroy the mobile player. The mobile player also might have had significantly easier games because they are on mobile. I remember hearing a quote from Ninja essentially saying, “if the leaderboard is cross-platform, put me in games with players on console.” And he is exactly right, that if the competition is playing on the same scoreboard, they should have to be put against each other, not divided. Imagine all the professional soccer teams competing during season all for the same trophy, and that was it. Except they were all still in their current divisions. There were no other tournaments or league play outside of that one trophy. Well an MLS team might win that trophy, but we all know an MLS team most likely would not be better than a team like Real Madrid, but Real Madrid sure had to compete against SIGNIFICANTLY better teams and better competition. I know there is Champions League but work with me here please. 


When the next competitive event came out, Blitz Showdown, I was again ecstatic to prove my worth after a not so great result the first time of 177th. Unfortunately, the same leaderboard system from the last iteration had plagued Blitz Showdown. To the developers, they did improve this event tremendously. The games were faster, you only had to complete 25 matches, and kills counted as 3 points per. That doesn’t take away from the fact that whatever device you were playing on, you weren’t really competing against JUST that device, you were competing against every person who completed those 25 games on any device across the globe. I ended up 121st in NA. 


Surely after that event and the complaining from the community, they would change it to a device-based leaderboard. I should only be ranking and playing against people on console. PC players should only be ranking and playing against PC players. You get the idea. After the news came out that there is another competitive mode for season 5, again I was again thrilled. Unfortunately, this was invite only. That’s okay, I did great for a console player and surely, they’ve made device-based divisions. Nope. The only player that I know of that was invited to this event that plays via console was NickMercs. Ask any good console player and they will probably tell you they know SIGNIFICANTLY better players than him.


Imagine someone who doesn’t know anything about the game but is a savvy businessman. IMAGINE their face when you told them that Epic wasn’t allowing their largest customer base to compete in these events at all. That the largest customer base doesn’t have any potential to compete in these simply because of the device they are playing on. What are the repercussions of this?

A couple negatives that are introduced with all this:


+Alienation of the largest percentage of people who play your game.
+No incentive to improve for non-PC players outside of regular public matches
+Potential loss of interest in Fortnite due to the gamer not wanting to participate in an event they can’t see themselves competing in
+Following loss of interest, loss of revenue and an angrier active player base	
+Less interest from console players in these events because of no representation inside the competitive Fortnite scene

A couple of positives introduced with this:

+None
How to fix this Epic:

+First, begin hosting tournaments for players outside of the realm of superstars. Streamers are amazing and create a great buzz around your game, I understand that completely. However, continuing down this path will result in the “rich getting richer” in my opinion. These streamers already get a huge amount of money and attention from your game. At some point you will reach as many people as you possibly can just through streamers, and that number is finite. When you introduce new, good players, you create buzz through friends, family, and then increase potential interest and revenue. I hope what I just said makes sense. 
+Second, create a bracket, a division, in which console players can compete against console players competitively. PC players shouldn’t have to compete against console players competitively. Vice versa. 
+I FEEL LIKE IM TAKING CRAZY PILLS?!?!?! DOES ANYONE ELSE NOT HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM WITH THE WAY COMPETITIVE IS GOING?!?!
+Third, incentivize other platforms, and hopefully eventually there will be other divisions besides PC. I know console would be the first step, and hopefully that comes really soon. But I also hope soon after that gamers on any device can have their own division and bracket.  


If anyone else has ANY suggestions on how to improve this situation, please let me know. I know a huge amount of people are switching over to PC just because of a lack of will to get better on console due to no incentive being there. Epic has already had a slew of problems, and I hope in the future they can figure this out.

Most of the time you just need one trap to kill somebody now unless they’re above 150 in health and shield. I do like traps &amp; I feel they’re so satisfying to get kills with, but I thought the 100 damage was the most fair of them all. It only takes you to go around the wrong corner then bam, you’re gone. 100 dmg with a trap still left you (in that situation with a fighting chance if you were above 100 health.

these people then just die (trying to be unsuspicious) to the streamer boosting them free points and giving them an easy edge.   
the streamer can claim plausible deniability since many random people will try to queue up in the timeframe of the tournament to snipe some random player competing.  
another problem that one might encounter is that if these stream snipers don't get into the same game they just leave and potentially fuck another streamer's game by bringing down the potential kill count.

So, i have the option to play on PS4 or PC, till now i played on PS4 but iam wondering if i will have any disadvantage in the future in terms of tournaments because i am a console player?

While im not comfortable with the M+KB Controls yet i would be willing to learn it if it is necessary.


Also i have the problem that i am kind of in a Wall, that means i have problems to identify my mistakes in this game. Once i figure out a mistake i am fast in fixing it, but figuring it out in this game in particular falls really hard for me.

Any advice to one of those topics?

Pushing every player and base I see in my rotations. Towards the last week of Season 4 I was winning at least 1 solo a day, with around a 10% winrate. Nothing special, but I'm not looking to go pro so my only competition is myself. Just always looking to improve.

When Season 5 and the spray meta arrived a week ago I've only won 1 solo, with most of my games not even making it to the second circle. I know I should be a bit less aggressive, since splodes and spray weapons have taken the place of snipes in 1x1 campers' loadouts, making it really easy to defend a base.

I don't want to go away from holding W completely because high-ish kill dubs is what makes this game fun for me. But what I want to ask other aggressive players is what loadout you prefer the most, and what ways you have tweaked your game to stay competitive this season. 

Most specifically I want to know what your take is on pump vs tac, and which you would prefer to use. I used to double pump but since all the nerfs I rarely even pick up pumps anymore. The pump feels too slow with the pullout delay but I do miss its range and tighter spread compared to the tac. Obviously the heavy is the best shotgun in the game but which do you prefer? Tac or pump? 

I've also considered moving away from shotguns altogether and just running double smg or double drum, and I also want to hear from other players about how that loadout has fared for them.

I'm not a fan of the new meta but I know I gotta work with what I have. Right now I'm not doing a great job of making it work. So let me know how you guys have managed to work with what you have!

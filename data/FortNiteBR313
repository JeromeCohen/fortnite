It would make the early game feel more rewarding, even if it's just something visual to show out.

So in my case I would get some swampy effect surrounding my character or at my footsteps to go along with maybe something that count my kills for when I survive my beloved Moisty Mire. It could be anything, even something more simple that would have a color detail for each spot of the map and how many kills the player got there.

Of course, this would also work in the center area of the map, but maybe there would be a problem ""crowning"" a king for places like Tilted due to how many people drop in these and the craziness of the fight.

Extending the idea it could also come with some extra XP for ""conquering"" a zone or some new challenges attached to this mechanism.

I'm sure there's a way to polish this idea, but I just wanted to get it out there. Also, I wish I had time and skills to do some visual concepts to go with it but, I will leave this to reddit if y'all like my suggestion.

TL;DR a visual effect that would show other players in your match (solos) that you dropped in a certain place, i.e. ""moisty mire"" and survived the initial fights with ""X"" kills",FortNiteBR

It now feels I'm running out of materials more and more at the end of games, which everyone knows makes it almost impossible to win against any players who have materials. This results in players who look for fights being killed by those who stay in the same spot all game, due to everyone being fairly competent at building meaning that when fighting someone you generally have to use about 300 mats, and because farming is so much more tedious the opponent often barely drops any mats after being killed, resulting in the aggressive player being punished for playing in such a way. This promotes camping, and seems to significantly reduce the skill gap, meaning people are playing less and less due to the tediousness of farming paired with the frustration of being killed by a lesser skilled player who avoided fighting all game. Epic, please either give us a reason for reducing mats or put the mats back to how they were a few months ago.",FortNiteBR

So there's a concept I am thinking about for a while now, and before I want to work things out in pictures, I would like to share my idea and would like to hear suggestions, input and probably quite some changes. (With the risk of the idea getting stolen, but it's for the community anyway). I also feel we should give more love to Epic Games, the game is free to play (hitherto). They giving us some great times in the gaming world (solo, with friends and new people met in Fortnite). They always working on updates, new content and try to get rid of the bugs. Please give them more love, keep sharing idea's and keep this incredible fun game running as long as possible.     

So we do have weekly challenges for the ones with a Battle Pass, which is really cool since we all like to do challenges, but they are not really hard and can be done pretty easily. 

I was thinking of 'Achievements', the achievements will always be there and are just becoming a collection of your Fortnite Battle Royale career. Achievements can be challenges but a little harder, I think it is important every player can achieve them, the high skilled, but also the lesser skilled players.  

The idea came up from Call of Duty, for example 'Call in 500 Care Packages 241/500' and you get rewarded with some experience, an avatar and maybe a banner. I think it's cool if the achievements will have titles and reward you with an avatar you can show to your party members. 

I thought of the following challenges so far, to get the following achievements: 

* Open 18 Ammo Boxes in one game (0/3) | Achievement: 'Lock 'n Load'
* Open 12 Treasure Chests in one game (0/5) | Achievement: 'Call me Jack'
* Open 5 Supply Drops in one game (0/3) | Achievement: 'Who Is Dropping These Things?'
* Open 2 Llamas in one game (0/1) | Achievement: 'When The Stars Align'
* Eat 20 Mushrooms in one game (0/1) | Achievement: 'Wow..., MAGIC!'
* Become the first owner of 3 Launch Pads in one game (0/3) | Achievement: 'I'm So Fly'
* Become the first owner of 5 Traps one game (0/3) | Achievement: 'Punk Is Not Dead'
* Stack 999 Wood, 999 Stone and 999 Metal in one game (0/1) | Achievement: 'Get Money, Get Stacks'
* Eliminate opponents with a Pistol, SMG and Shotgun in one game (0/1) | Achievement: 'Do It Quick'
* Eliminate opponents with a Sniper Rifle, Assault Rifle and LMG in one game (0/1) | Achievement: 'No Aim, No Gain'
* Eliminate opponents with a Grenade, RPG and Grenade Launcher in one game (0/1) | Achievement: 'The Mad Bomber' 
* Land in Flush Factory, eliminate an opponent in Risky Reels (0/1) | Achievement: 'Call It A Day' 
* Land in Junk Junction, eliminate an opponent in Moisty Mire (0/1) | Achievement: 'Designated Sur... Assassin'
* Visit the Crab, Fox and Lama in one game (0/1) | Achievement: 'Project Charles'  

Maybe when ones lucky enough some achievements are easily achieved, therefore I was thinking of adding long\-term achievements, but not specified yet: 

* Open Ammo Boxes (0/2000)
* Open Treasure Chests (0/2000)
* Open Supply Drops (0/200)
* Open Lamas (0/30) 
* Eliminate opponents (0/2000)
* Land in Tilted Towers (0/100)
* Land in Retail Row (0/100)
* Land in Salty Springs (0/50)
* Land in Lucky Landing (0/50)

I love this game , however, the reason I‚Äôm about to quit this game is because epic is trying to lower to skill gap between good players and bad players. 

The biggest way there doing this is by lowering how much mats you get. Im a very fast builder and I literally run out of mats almost every fight. I literately farm 80% of the game. Its not fun no more. Nobody wants to spend 15 minutes hitting trees, how is that fun , epic? 

If i wanted to play a game without building i would go play pubg. I play this game to get into building fights but I constantly keep running out of mats or after each fight i gotta spend another 15 minutes gathering mats for my next fight.  


Increase the damn mats you get. Give us 200 mats per tree and stop worrying about new players before you lose the players who are already playing your game.

I'm just giving my thoughts on the most important aspect of the game.

1. **Building is and will always be meta.** This game is obviously no longer new, and neither are most of the players. The meta is build. Always build. When running into an experienced player you almost always have to have at least 500 wood which, now, can take forever to harvest. In a game categorized as a shooter, I'd rather not have to harvest mats for 5 minutes after every encounter I have with a good player (which these days is a lot).

2. **Beginning of matches are really dry**. With the floor-loot mat nerf, build battles in the early game are more scarce than ever. In a good game early on, 200 wood is considered good. Usually I'll end up with 150 if I get a house to myself. That's not enough to survive Tilted Towers, needless to say the most popular section of the map where combat is common and building is essential.

3. **Harvesting isn't fun**. Don't think I have go into detail with this. This isn't Minecraft.

4. **Nobody wanted a nerf to materials at any point in the game's history, yet it continues to happen**. Back in the day, those little tiny pine trees could net you 30 wood in 3-4 hits (might be wrong, its been a while). Now they get you 15. Floor mats would give 30. Llamas would give 500 EACH. Build fights are so much fun. It's actually the reason some streamers like Daequan play the game. Forcing people to harvest more is NOT fun.

5. **There is a reason Blitz is one of the most popular LTM's.** Harvesting is less and the storm closes in faster (that's another issue to tackle ;). Having more materials frees me up to hunt for players, giving more confidence to enter a fight. Fights are more determined now by who can find the most/best trees. Outbuilding an opponent and getting the high ground is the most important thing in this game (besides having a shotty) and giving more materials than even BEFORE all these nerfs will put everyone on an even playing field in at least one aspect of this game, building.

**Solution** 

Buff mats back to the way they were from the beginning. And I mean *the* beginning. After that, buff them even more. I would say 33% to 40% more resources harvested and 50 mats spawned as floor loot. I'm no dev so I'm sure these numbers are little much. I'll edit if need-be. Thx for bearing with!

Shotgun Nerfs - New players can't one pump you, good players will be able to win fights being at 30-90 HP. 

Damage Nerfs/Buffs - Multiple guns are viable for a lot of different situations and not every engagement is all about shotguns. Traps are powerful enough to make rushing into houses/bases risky, which is what their sole purpose was in the first place, defense (also boxing somebody in now is easier but if you're good you should easily be able to counter it)

Removing the fucking jetpack - AC-130ing people with RPGs does not make you a skilled player

People complain and complain about Epic making it easier for new players to win, but if that was the case, the pumps would still do 256, instant pull out time and double/triple/quad pump would still be a thing, RPGs would be instakills, reduced shield like in S1,S2, no campfires, more mats per object, and things like the thermal ar wouldn't be introduced.

all of this is my opinion and you're welcome to give me your reasoning on why you believe I'm wrong, I'm open to anyone else's ideas.

I've thought a lot about how Epic could bring back old skins without them becoming ""not special anymore"", and I came up with legacy items. Legacy items would be old cosmetics that are brought back at a higher price, but only for players who played the game before those cosmetics first came out. So, let's say that the 'Skull Trooper' skin was brought back into the item shop in the legacy items section. Only people who played the game before October 25, 2017 can buy it, since that's when it first came out. This would be a much smarter way to return old cosmetics into the shop, because newer players wouldn't be able to buy them. Epic could implement this as a tribute to the players who have supported Fortnite since the beginning, who maybe didn't have the money to buy cosmetics back then.

I'd love for Epic Games to add gyro aiming to Fortnite. Not only would it be more enjoyable, but it'd also bring more accuracy to the game.

Before you say ""reee my skills will be bad compared to them"", the PS4 version of Fortnite supports KBM, and even if you disallow such aiming, a CronusMax can get around it. Might as well allow gyro aiming right?  Allowing it on the PS4 should be a thing too as PS4 players also contain a gyroscope within their controllers. Gyro aiming is the closest thing a PS4 and Switch player can get to rival a PC gamer.

Epic Games, hear my suggestion out! Hopefully this will be added in a future patch :)

It is clear that Epic is currently experimenting with materials, and I thought this idea is worth suggesting.

When farming the big trees, the majority of players usually leave them at 50 health because they easily give away your position, and there is no reason for finishing them off since the last hit barely gives any materials.

So instead, what if the last 50 damage done to the big trees gave the equivalent amount of wood as 150 would. 

Why?

Because this implements a risk and reward system into farming and it would give materials a slight buff whilst maintaining a risk that would balance it out. Essentially, by making the last hit on a big tree you are giving yourself extra mats but reveal your position to nearby enemies as a trade-off. Last hitting would also likely increase the amount of players you encounter, which allows more aggressive players to get more materials as well as get into more fights.

Barely level 57 right now. Just watching it getting further and further away is really upsetting.

I know there are tons of others like me who are gonna be close at mid 70s as it ends watching it be gone forever because we got screwed by the nerfed experience rates. 

Why was exp removed from kills? Solo games net almost no experience. Unless you are playing full squad with everyone having boosted experience you get practically nothing.

The general concept is for a consumable that changes the player into landscape/ environment object in the game such as a group of rocks, a tree, a car... etc. However this change is only temporary e.g. 15\-30 seconds and is to be used in high pressure situations that makes you ""invisible"" if you are not seen applying the consumable\- ideal for getting out of tricky spots at low health! 

Once consumed the player cannot move whilst the potion is taking effect but can take damage much like wearing a bush until the disguise is broken.

We've also discussed the issue of turning into an object that is out of place in a particular environment but he suggests the disguise should automatically choose an object that is suitable to the area.

The name might need some work.

*I was going to add some tasty graphics to this but then realised I have no clue how to design anything like that so just edited a slurp!*

TL;DR: Potion that turns you into a prop for a short amount of time to avoid detection from enemies in high\-pressure scenarios.

Let's be honest here, the grind to obtain the omega is not really focused on ability but more to reward a players time spent in the game so we aren't playing other developers games. StW is essentially the same game so help us out here Epic?

How about giving player some sort of battle royale xp reward linked to completing missions in StW?

If they want to make this game to be more welcoming to new players then this is not the right way to do it. I got attracted to this game because of the intense building fights it brings.

I don't see what's so troublesome of asking for a LTM without building once in a while.


I don't have the most time to game, and when I do, I love me some pvp gameplay. CSGO is fun and all but I enjoy some BR action every now and then. PUBG, in my opinion, is just a loot fest until you're in the top 6, if not, you just get shot across the map while you're randomly running making sure you free-look everywhere.


Fortnite is so much more fast paced and I enjoy the art style and gunplay much more than any other BR game. The only thing I despise is the building, but only because I only have maybe a few hours to game each week. It wouldn't kill EPIC to implement a LMT where buliding is disabled every now and then. There is a HUGE audience for it and I'm sure they could even gain a little more of their already growing playerbase.


What myself, and a big chunk of people are asking for, is NOT that big of a deal. Just disable building every now and then for the LTM. PLEASE. We have been asking for this for MONTHS.

It recently underwent an ammo nerf, which I think was a step in the right direction. RPG spam is so prevalent late game, so it was a much needed change.

However, it still is basically a substitute for shotguns and SMGs. The splash damage is enough to kill you if you try to jump away, but not enough to kill the enemy shooting at you. 

All that being said, I have nothing against the RPG being used to destroy bases. It is pretty easy to counter at medium to long range, as you have a good amount of time to build or move out the way.

Hopefully I get some feedback, and I would like to know of any strategies to counter it.

-&gt; There is *NO DAMAGE DROPOFF* over range, this is insane because in situations where regular ARs would do 15-16dmg, your thermal scoped AR will still do 37 dmg.
-&gt; Thermal scope allows for players to scan the map and find players extremely far away, I've seen and killed several people across loot lake (255m)
-&gt; You can actually duck in-between shots while maintaining your aim, if practiced well. It's rather effective to avoiding dmg, imo.

... I'm enjoying using it while it lasts though :)

Thoughts? I feel as if this needs to be nerfed.

When it comes to playing on consoles, having the ability to precisely control your aim by tilting/rotating your controller gives you a HUGE advantage. Just look at Splatoon 1 &amp; 2 (a third person shooter game exclusively for the Wii U/ Switch)... ALL of the top players have motion controls enabled. Players who use sticks can't aim for shit compared to those of us who use motion. There's no debate about it whatsoever.

If Fortnite eventually decides to support motion controls for the Switch edition, the world will finally know what us Splatoon players have been raving about for years. Switch users will be INFINITELY better than those on other consoles, and people will FINALLY be aware of the advantages motion controls provide. Motion control players will legitimately be able to compete with PC players (though mouse/keyboard is still a slightly better control scheme).

(Experiment),"As many people have noticed, you need grind for hours and hours a day in order to level up. Playing with 3 other friends who owns a battle pass will make it much easier with the XP boost, but what about if you play solo? How much do you actually need to play in order to get to lvl 100? Is it even possible if you play alone? Let's see.

I started the experiment at lvl 55 by writing down the amount of XP I gain every match just to see how much matches you need to play to level up just by one level.

In order to level up from level 55 to level 56 you need to gain 8500 XP. It took me roughly 4 hours and 25 matches to level up a single level with my 100% XP boost. Around 20 of these matches were played in 50v50 gamemode since it gives you the most XP. I won about 15 or these games and average amount of XP I got was 400 each game. Most XP was given by surviving the longest and only 50 XP was given for an elimination. If you die in first 10 minutes of the game you get around 80 XP. If you don't do anything the entire match, but still win, you will get around 300 XP. If you get around 5 kills and win, you will get about 600 XP.

Based on this, I would say it's pretty much impossible to reach lvl 100 if you play alone, even if you spend 4 hours a day grinding.",FortNiteBR

I have been playing this game since literal day one and I loved it it was fun, simple and was always growing its player base and adding new things.  I have had updates where it would completely stop me from wanting to play the game for a few days because they changed the way I liked to play (double pump, all the wood nerfs, and removing bounce pads) but never ones that have made me completely quit. I feel like with every update the game gets farther from what made it popular especially the most recent shotgun and mat Nerf,the materiel one is what surprised me the most, how could you take away from what made your game original?  was anyone complaining about someone building? no. some of my favorite parts of this game is going into the sky against my opponent but now if I even have the mats for it I dread having to mine the resources for the next fight.  the other part of the update is my least favorite but I know that it was something a lot of people liked about it, the pump nerf. I was already getting tired of the game and the only thing that made the game fun for me was one pumping everyone around me, that is what I have been doing since the beginning of the game it was always so satisfying to do that and I know it still does 170 but the worry that they have 200 hp ruins the fun of it.

anyways the point of this post wasn't to rant at how bad fortnite has gotten, I want to know what you guys think of the recent changes, why you keep playing or why you stopped

Building, the key to fortnite, is slowly being ruined. By constant nerfs to farming and people being able to jump through your ramps and walls, it is slowly becoming a toxic thing. Build fights are useless now, as me and my opponent always die to a noob knocking it down üò≠. But the addition of horrible new skins and constant bugs, the game is at a horrible state. Here is the solution, I speak for myself but leave me your thoughts below: fix people phasing through buildings, stop adding new items and fix your current ones, work more with Reddit and be more transparent the ‚Äúwe have backend issues‚Äù and leave it on that, and make mats easier to obtain, not the opposite.

As a mobile player we basically don‚Äôt have a voice in the community. Whenever we post here we are drowned out by the ‚Äúinferior platform‚Äù or ‚Äúmobile lol‚Äù. It‚Äôs unfair. We have some many new bugs with each update and we never get any where near enough upvotes for epic to see posts concerning new bugs that need fixing or even suggestions. The mobile posts are either downvoted or lost in the constant flow of memes and LTM suggestions. 

Now we have a mobile dedicated sub however it‚Äôs following is tiny, it‚Äôs not official and the devs don‚Äôt check it. So any bugs posted there are just a complaint or query if anyone else is experiencing problems, and often these bugs take 2/3 weeks to fix. 

What we need is epic to speak to us as the mobile community and let us know how we can relay information to them about bugs. If they literally just made a statement saying ‚Äúyes we browse the fortnite mobile sub reddit‚Äù then all bugs would be moved away from the main sub to the mobile sub and thus less traffic and posts would ensue allowing PC, PS4 and Xbox posts to rise to the top. 

At the moment we have an awful bug on mobile where randomly the game mutes itself completely, and going into settings all the sliders are turned all the way up. The only fix at the minute is by moving the slider up and down and then applying. But this only lasts for 3-4 minutes. It‚Äôs so infuriating being in a battle and then complete silence ensuing and not being able to hear your opponent. 

Anyways if this is lost in the stream of posts about skin concepts and bounce pad 360s then so be it. I‚Äôm just trying to stand up and give a voice to the little guys playing on the lesser known platform. Thanks.

I know he didn't attempt anything shady because he wasn't even that hardcore about the game, he was a pretty casual player who didn't have any interest in forcing a win using any illegal methods. He then made a new account to play on until Epic support has responded to his ticket but the moment he jumped out of the bus for the first time on this account, he was kicked out of the game. This happened for every single account he made. Then, after a week or more, Epic's slow reply finally came through telling him that he was machine banned and that they couldn't do anything about it. That's all. They didn't tell him what he was banned for and they didn't try to communicate anything and seemed pretty settled about him never being able to play the game again. This is very inconvenient as an active visitor of this subreddit because I was beginning to think Epic were different than most other online games' devs on the communication side. I am posting this on his behalf because he just simply lost hope for anything to change at this point.

But with current battle pass, it's so much harder. We have to level up to 80 for all styles for omega which is harder since epic decided to make it harder to level up (you need 532.250 xp to reach to level 80). And now there is an another feature that we need to level up to use. The light color on omega and carbide. 

I'm not telling it to be too easy, I'm telling that last season was easy, and this season is so hard. I think it wasn't necessary to make leveling up harder. At least it should give more battle stars per level as it's harder to level up. If it was like that, we could tier up to omega faster and the other level ups would give us xp earlier.

This was to help players who weren‚Äôt solid at building. Then, the jet pack was added. Players who aren‚Äôt strong at building could just launch themselves into the air to get some free shots on strong builders. Now recently, mats have been nerfed and C4 has been insanely buffed. Like the jet pack, I think C4 takes the fun away from build fights. For example if you‚Äôre in a build fight with a good player, some bot can come along, throw 2 C4s at the base of the build fight, and get a free double kill. It‚Äôs frustrating how much Epic is trying to help out the casuals. 

But, with that being said, it‚Äôs understandable. For those of us who started playing near the release of the game, we all sucked, but progressively got better as we learned. For a player who‚Äôs brand new to come and play starting now, it‚Äôd take so long for them to get better because the majority of fights they‚Äôre in, they‚Äôre going against people who‚Äôve been grinding for months. 

I think Epic might just be trying to dissuade them from playing for a few days, and giving up because they‚Äôre so many sweaties these days.

476,TheCaptain-Ahoy,1528813874,8qjdpm,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8qjdpm/data_driven_insights_console_settings/,1,Data Driven Insights: Console Settings,"Hello reddit. I want to use this awesome community and my knowledge of data analysis to attempt to answer the age old question: ‚ÄúWhat are the best Fortnite console settings?‚Äù Rather than asking your favorite streamer what their settings are, let‚Äôs try and figure this out using some statistical analysis. 

Just some background, I‚Äôm an avid Fortnite player and also a credentialed actuary. I thought I could use my profession and passion for gaming and streaming to try and help everyone out with optimal settings. I know we will have people comment on this post saying settings are just a preference, which is entirely true. What I want to do is give people confidence that their settings aren‚Äôt holding them back from improving, so they can focus their time on other aspects of the game, rather than obsessing about settings. 

If you all could please input your settings in the linked survey, I will do my best to provide some analytical insights..Thank you!

if they spam shots and they try to put their own walls down instead of yours they have to shoot and switch and build while you can just stand there with turbo build on and your mouse button down

it becomes a war of attrition to see who runs out of ammo or materials first and killing someone who has no materials or ammo is pointless because you dont get loot from them ",FortNiteBR

Harvesting trees and rocks for the first 10 minutes of the game because one tree gives you 20 wood is BORING.

Building is what makes Fortnite stand out from the other battle royale games, not harvesting. We don't have fun hitting a tree or smashing a rock, we have fun fighting to death. 

Epic, please, stop nerfing what makes this game amazing and unique, we don't want to play looney toons edition of pubg, we want to play Fortnite. ",FortNiteBR

Epic games is so focused on making their game ‚Äúcasual player friendly‚Äù that they‚Äôre going to lose their core audience. Take the double pump for example, good players knew how to use it and defend against it with building, but worse players just kept getting killed by it and complaining, and Epic actually listened.

I think that siphon made the game easier (more build at spawn, ...) for most of the players, and made the game SUPER FUN for the 10% strongest players.

&gt; Metagame for close combat in Season 5:

+ SMGs alone (SMG, Silenced SMG, Drum Gun, Compact SMG)

+ Double Barrel alone

+ Double Barrel + Grappler

+ Double Barrel + any SMG

+ Double Barrel + AR/Silenced AR

+ Heavy Shotgun + any SMG

+ Heavy Shotgun + AR/Silenced AR

= 3 different guns on the metagame

&gt; In Season 5 i could counter any of these combos with one of them, just keeping far from Double Barrel and avoiding angle for the enemy to shoot me with a Heavy Shotgun and turbo build in people spamming SMGs untill they need to reload, and we could shoose between these options and win matches.

.

Actual metagame for close combat:

+ Pump Shotgun alone (with edits and/or building)

+ Pump + AR

+ Pump + SMG

+ Pump + Flint Knock

+ Pump + Hand Cannon

= 1 gun in the metagame

&gt; Pump is unbeatable, is the best and only option for close combat, because ARs and SMGs you need to keep shooting to kill the enemy and the enemy can counter it with building, with Pump is one shot and 100 of life is gone.

So people don't like the game ""unbalanced"" or people don't like the game with a different meta that they don't expect? Because this is what i feel with people don't saying anything about the actual shitty meta, but love to hate the Season 5 meta.

(I know the problems of the Season 5 meta for competitive matches like Arena or tournaments, the actual is better for this part of the game, but Epic could clearly remove guns for Arena and tournaments and keep them on pubs, it's a different way to play the game and one benefit one part of the game but screw the other part and vice versa.)",FortNiteBR

MANY other employees in other industries are regularly put under the same types of pressure and hours that have been sensationalized in the news. Just because EPIC makes a video game for kids doesn't mean that the situation should be viewed as some unique type of unethical corporate abuse. These employees don't get a bail out because they work for EPIC. Accountants, investment bankers, engineers, and even musicians all grind and make huge sacrifices when they commit themselves to a massive/rapidly expanding organization. Its a problem with American working culture as a whole, not EPIC games. Calling for EPIC to relax their working hours is holding them to a standard that other companies aren't held to, and its unfair to expect them to do so.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately EPIC is owned by a large global investment firm. Their job is to be profitable and raise value for their shareholders.

I literally can’t play ONE single game of fortnite without experiencing at least one kind of bug. Now it’s a roll of the dice on wether that bug will get me killed, get me in a position to get killed, or luckily will just cause annoyance to me. 

What is going on?! You preach about wanting to make your game look the best it can. You talk about wanting  a fair game. Quit taking advantage of the uniqueness of your game, expecting us players to keep playing just because no other game can give us what fortnite does with building.

Clearly, you're overworked. And we can't ask you to stop making updates each week as we all know you make revenue off new skins and have to update the game to bring players back in, but really, I'd rather you take a whole season off from one department, just to do some catch up on fixing bugs without introducing new mechanics to cause issues. 

 If not for the imediate integrity of the game, but simply because I want season 10 to launch with as little hitches as possible. 


You can even rotate vaulted items/weapons from before back into the game and continue to update the map. Hell, you could even involve players and just have the vault/voting system to determine what's the fan favorite of the week.


I'm sure there's plenty of promotional art already created for season 9 now, and I understand you need to follow through with that, but anything that can be delayed, should be delayed for as long as possible.

After not playing for a a while, i decided to install it and see if it has changed. Honestly, the only thing that really has changed is the whole arena mode and how competitive it is. Every other change was normal and bound to happen. The game is not fun in anyway way shape or form. I play with friends is boring now. Playing solos is boring. Winning is boring. Killing is boring.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly believe people only play this game because of these reasons

1) It is popular and you want to play a popular game and there really is not any other game to play

2) You are addicted to it

3) You think you can become a big streamer of this game or make money of this game

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't see any other reason you would play the game. I am 100% that most streamers and player don't really enjoy the game. Big streamers play the game because they make money of it but i don't get how players can play this game and say ""I play it because it is fun"", sorry but i believe that is Bullshit. Feel free to change my mind

&amp;#x200B;

The next day (yesterday) I logged in and received another notification that said “the following items have been removed from your account” and listed the items from the bundle and, sure enough, the skin and challenges are no longer on my account. Additionally, the pack doesn’t show up any more for me in the in-game store and in the playstation store it says “no available” (probably because it think i already own it.) 

Anyone else experience this ‘transaction reversal’? I know many people experienced the initial delay in receiving the items.

The Tac is for people who are less confident with shotguns. Not only does the Tac serve as a counter to shotguns it also gives less confident players a chance to win. As a person who likes both shotguns and smg’s this will definitely close the skill gap a bit. 

Bouncers - Don’t need to return, useless with all the mobility items we have now

Drum Gun - Was fun but very OP

Infinity Blade - We all know how that turned out

Planes - Same as bouncers, aren’t needed as we have tons of mobility. 

Grapplers - Not needed same reason as bouncers

Can't see how Epic employees ''work'' 10hours aday but can't fix basic bugs that's been in the game since the pump pulloutdelay was implementet. Don't undestand how one of the biggest games out there can host World Championship with bugs that have such big influence on the game.

So yesterday I played some games of Endgame LTM in order to do my challenges and get the Quinjet.
The quests are pretty easy but one is I think impossible. I played 3 games as a chitauri and this happens : we were 7v17 - 7v18- 5v19.  
Now, it is impossible to complete ""Win 3 games as a chitauri"" because 3/4 of chitauris are leaving the game for no reasons.
I think there are 2 possibilities:
- You ban people who are doing that and give us enough time to complete this challenge
-You increase Chitauris' reasons

If you can't realize these 2 possibilities please Epic give the quinjet to all people who finished 9 challenges. We deserve to get the quinjet because the last challenge is just impossible.

I hope you will read my message and I'm waiting for an Epic's answer. I am convinced many of you are in this situation so let's give visibilty to this post.",FortNiteBR

On these posts, whenever Dusty Depot is mentioned I see the same comment every time “shit location” I don’t think these people understand what makes a good location. Loot is not the only thing that matters in a location.  Just because a location has good loot doesn’t make it a good location. Depot had sub par loot, but was right in the center of the map, was in a super open area that was easy to fight in, and was right next to the factories, which meant you could rack up tons of kills and get better loot in the process. 

Divot, in my opinion is the worst location in Fortnite’s history. It is by far the worst place on the map to have a fight in, looks like shit, makes rotations a hundred times harder and isn’t really that popular. I see tons of people on this sub defending Divot because it has tons of loot and mats, but I rarely see more then 1 to 2 people drop here. This location is also probably in the worst place in the map possible. If you land retail or salty, you are almost guaranteed to have to go through the Divot which slows you down a ton and risks being ambushed by a team hiding somewhere under the trees. 

It’s just not a good location overall and I don’t know why I have to explain why having a giant hole in the middle of the map is not good.

The thing is, it's not necessarily

3 advantages lower FOV has over 90 :

\-Better performance. Obviously having more FPS is nice.

\-Closer view of ennemies. Long-range engagements are a lot harder with a higher FOV as the ennemies would appear smaller. It's especially hard for higher sensitivities to aim for really small targets.

\-The jarring transition when Aiming Down the Sight. Higher FOV means the camera is farther away from the character model, so when ADSing the zoom is higher.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, higher FOV means you can see better around you, but this is mostly useful in close range fights. It also means you can turn around quicker because it's less zoomed out so you can cover more angle with the same mouse or pad movement. Oh and also your character model takes a bit less space, and you can see the entierety of the character model which can be nice.

Overall I'd say higher FOV is better for close range, lower FOV is better for long range. They balance each-other pretty well. Also depends on your performance, your screen size, stuff like that.

So guys keep in mind, if they ever introduce an FOV slider, it might not necessarily be better to use the maximum value. A higher FOV is not necessarily better ! You'd have to find the value that is the best for you. Just like sensitivity !",FortNiteBR

**INTRODUCTION**
Fortnite has had in-game events for a while now .As most of you know the next event will most likely have a voting system to have a weapon brought out from the vault and back into BR. We vote in game in Loot Lake during the event  The options available are grapplers, infinity blade, planes, tactical smg, drum gun and bouncers. In this post I’ll explain why bouncers should be your main choice.

**EXPLANATION**
Let’s compare bouncers to the other guns/mobility to be unvaulted. Bouncers were used mostly to prevent fall damage but also could push you a few stories up. They were also used for rotating late game in scrims/tourneys. They did not limit you because they took up a trap spot unlike redeploy.  They were pretty common as they were a blue item. Now let’s talk about the other items.

*Drum Gun*

I feel like this is the most important weapon to address since many will vote for this. The drum gun is a very good gun. This is why epic will nerf it. It’ll probably be upped to gold rarity , he mag size will change and even the damage. It does not make sense to leave a gun in the game that is better than its legendary counterpart. 

*Tactical SMG*

This gun is pretty balanced and good like bouncers. It would be alright added back with a slight nerf. But why vote for this? It’s another smg we don’t need. We already have the suppressed smg which pretty much the same. 

*Infinity Blade and Storm-wing*

Some people just wanna see the world burn. What’s the point of adding these? Flying on a plane with high health is more toxic than ballers in scrims. The infinity blade seems much worse now and pretty bad. But imagine being in a fight , cleaning up the kill then getting chopped by a blade. Not a good feeling huh? Whatever you do do not vote for these. 

*Grappler*

This gun is alright and pretty balanced if it had a lower range. But why use a ten charge gun which takes up a slot when you can use the hamster ball. It has infinite chargers and can even move you around the map. It even protects you from bullets.

**CONCLUSION*

Bouncers would be a healthy addition to the game that can add a little variety to the meta and can be used in many situations.

Also, they said 80 FOV is the best, and 90 or higher causes motion sickness. Research has been done showing its the opposite. 80 FOV is one of the beginning stages of motion sickness in an FOV. That's not all.

The hero team is expected to eliminate 99 chitauri, and defend 6 stones, all while someone is hopping around as a giant Thanos. Their objective and the accomodations they get to acquire said objective is piss easy, and something seriously needs to be done about it.  


  


For starters, the heroes don't even spawn in with weapons, we have to painstakingly search for a treasure chest, or find a rare chest since their spawn rate is down. By time you can get your gear together, two stones are already given to the enemy team, so they only have 4 left to get. So you have to pretty much kill 99 of them while they just have to acquire 4 stones.  


  


Typically near the end of the match, they'll just camp away so you can't kill them, waiting for the stone to respawn so they can just hop on it and get it with ease. The most annoying part is when a 4,000 health Thanos literally can just stand there and tank hits while picking it up.

I think I get a fair amount of wins, but my K/D ratio has always been &lt;1. The information available on the topic has been limited to say the least and if you every post your stats anywhere, you get the classic responses...""dude, a 7% win rate is hardly average"" or ""you must be a bot if you have a K/D less than 1.""

&amp;#x200B;

So, I began searching the web for a solution. Recently, I stumbled upon a post by user [**chateaupeter**](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/member/14679894-chateaupeter) on Epic's message board (link below).

[https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battle-royale/strats-tactics/941837-a-formula-to-determine-percentile-rank-from-win-rate-and-k-d-ratio](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battle-royale/strats-tactics/941837-a-formula-to-determine-percentile-rank-from-win-rate-and-k-d-ratio) 

This post provided a mathematical way to calculate Elo (a concept that predicts the results of a head-to-head matchup) and  explains how to calculate percentile based on your Elo score. I should point out, that this percentile should not really be used as way to predict your chances of winning a match, but rather your percentage chance of winning a single 1v1 fight with an average opponent.

&amp;#x200B;

Using the formula provided I graphed out what your percentile would be given your K/D ratio for a range of win rates. The following chart shows K/D ratios from 0 to 10 and the band corresponds to win rates between 0 and 30. You can see where an average player and Ninja (for comparison) show up.

[Win Percentile \(0-10 K\/D\)](https://i.redd.it/c0ina0todnv21.jpg)

I expect that most people have a K/D ratio less than 2, so I also have a chart that is zoomed in on that portion.

# PLEASE ADD YOUR STATS

Interested to see where you stack up??? I'm interested to see if the distribution actually follows a normal bell curve, so I have created a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12nAzHhHDwQFNiUOlFJPv1ON-eGq-DbcRC-iwB7R9a9M/edit?usp=sharing) where you can calculate your own percentile and add your stats to the study. Please click on the link, find a blank row and add your stats (wins/kills/matches) in the blue boxes.

İt does require skill and and you can outedit someone and hide at the same time which makes turtling usefull.

But turtling have problems and needs to be gone!!

1- It is the most boring part of this game ( maybe second most boring after sniping battles) and damn doesnt epic wants noobs to excel in pubs? With arena and current competitive meta nowadays creative zone wars are more common for good players than creative 1-1s.  Even a noob shots someone he cant kill a above avarage turtler...So in my opinion instead of diminishing farming, turtling being gone would make the game more noob friendly.

2- In this game best defensive builder would beat the best offensive player.... This is a problem because nowadays playing agrresive is risky and turtle meta makes arena make less attractive for players like me who wants to play like psycho.

3- Biggest problem about the turtle is damn... you do not need be a great editor to kill someone.  For example turtle, open a hole and shoot than put him a box trap and he is gone... dude this is not diffrent from sniping a clueless enemy from tree with heavy sniper.. this is a cheap tactic and annoying.

4) This favors high ping so unless u are playing on a 1000$ internet connection , in turtling meta only content creators can survive when it comes to open tournaments.

P.s : I do not trutle unless I am in arena and  fighting with a turtling person for 1 minute consistently feels like chatting with ur grandfather about politics.

Hope epic handles it without increasing explosives or deagle buff or drumgun reintorduction. Best solution would be making someones wall editable by entire lobby when that person hides more than 30seconds or more stuff like stinks maybe.",FortNiteBR

Little did I know (I joined this subreddit shortly after season 8 launched) that @thesquatingdog put out his weekly map to help the community in the same way. I quickly pivoted and began adding these challenges every week to my map for all of those procrastinators but not for those gregs. I hope this helps some of you and all location credit goes to squatting and his awesome community. 

I am thinking about abandoning this project if people don't think it is needed or helpful (each season takes a fair amount of time to update the map and squattings looks better and works well if you don't get behind on the challenges) and that is just fine but if you like it and or if you are a developer and want to help or have any helpful ideas on how to make it better that would be really appreciated.",FortNiteBR

It’s fine I understand that because I hated it myself. During Season 5 I saw so many replies on Twitter saying: “Like to Vault the Drum Gun!” or “Remove the spray meta!”. But then in patch 5.40 the Drum Gun was vaulted. And guess what happened next? People were mad at Epic Games for vaulting the Drum Gun. Believe me I saw soooo many replies on Twitter/Instagram about why did they vault the Drum Gun. Y’all litterally wanted the Spray meta gone and now you want the Spray meta back? Here’s a few reasons why you shouldn’t choose it.

Reasons to not choose it:
- Too many bullets
- Too much damage
- It destroys buildings like it’s nothing
- Very high Rate of Fire
- You don’t need any skill to use it - even Little Timmy could kill a pro player with it

But now let’s look at things now. There are leaks of The Nexus event ( aka the Vault event ). Players will be able to choose between 6 vaulted Items. And one of them is the Drum Gun. And guess what? I saw many polls on Twitter/Instagram. And the Drum Gun was the most voted one. If the Drum Gun gets Unvaulted, then  I’m gonna say Congratulations to all those who voted for it. The game will be ruined. Competitive will be f*cked and there will be almost no skill gap between The Good players and the Season 5 bots. Also, to those who will vote for it - if you say that it’s too strong or op - Don’t spam on Fortnite’s twitter to Vault it AGAIN. So please choose wisely. I hope I changed your mind.

What if players who owned StW were able to use their hero occasionally? Now I understand that this sounds REALLY bad. But here is my thinking: if a player is having some bad luck (really bad luck) and they have access to StW, to keep the player from raging off, they allow them to play as their StW hero. Of course, the other players in the lobby would be made aware of this. My only reasoning behind this was to prevent players from quitting the game (both old and new) This does require that you own StW. Of course this can't be exploited because the system would look at how long the player survived for. I understand that a lot of you would find them to be OP, but here's the thing, StW heroes can't damage player built structures with their weapons. Only their pickaxe. What do you guys think of this?

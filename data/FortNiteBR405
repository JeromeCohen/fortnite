Picking up a gun and not being able to shoot, meanwhile the enemy's gun renders in immediately and he wrecks me. Building during a gunfight and while I have the ramp selected, it builds a floor, I get wrecked because I have no cover. Having the jump on a guy, start shooting, hit the first 3 shots from an AR, drop a bunch of frames, next thing I know he teleports 15 feet to my right and 1 shots me with a pump. Building a base up high, game starts to lag, has me jumping all over the place, and throws me out of my base causing fall damage or death. The ol' ghost sniper bullets. It isn't my internet. Every other game works fine. Only Fortnite gives me these hellish issues with connection or bugs. I love this game more than anything that has been out in years but it's getting worse with every patch. Solos, duos, and squads combined I have well over 100 wins. I consider myself pretty good(far from great) but I'm plagued with bullshit deaths. I'll be the first to admit dying to my own bad aim or poor decision making, hell, lots of times players are just better than me. I get that. Im no god at Fortnite. Never have I felt so cheated by a game though. It sucks to have such love and hatred for it. Sniper only mode is cool, adding a new variation of shield every damn patch is cool(not really), but come on, fix the issues at hand instead of just adding more stuff to a broken game. I really do feel like this game could be perfect but this is ruining it. Sorry for the rant. Had to vent.",FortNiteBR

Start everyone off solo, but unlike normal solo-games players get downed instead of dying instantly. You can then choose to execute them for their loot, or recruit them to your squad. 

They could cap it at 4 like a normal squad, or use the 50v50 style markers to allow a larger squad size. Either way I think it has the potential to create a lot of fun &amp; unique experiences.

The stealth mode would have been amazing with Solo.  In fact you couldn't really sneak around in groups of 4. Squad mode undermined the theme and the playstyle that we expected to experience.

And now we have Snipers and a lot of us are scratching our heads as this mode seems to also benefit from Solo.  Like who wants to get a head shot only to have it just knock down the player?

I'm 15, I got an Xbox One less than a month ago, I thought it'd be neat, mainly so I can play games that aren't on the Switch yet. My friends helped me out with 2 trial codes but that was it.
I play Fortnite every day, and after just 3 weeks I'm level 53, and I absolutely love the game.
Since I don't have a steady flow of income, and I bought the Xbox myself, my parents aren't obligated to buy me Xbox live which I agree with, and since I am broke after buying the Xbox, I don't know what to do.
My friend told me a minute ago that the campaign is now free and a new gamemode is out for now, I really didn't want to beg but if anyone even has a trial code laying around, it'd be extremely appreciated.

Settings such as joystick deadzones (which are currently far too large in my opinion), fully remappable controls (none of this controller configuration nonsense) and more fine-tunable sensitivity settings would go a long way to allowing players to improve their gameplay. 

Just look at the battlefield 1 controller options, which has custom button mapping, and see the diversity in the options. This is one of the major downfalls of Fortnite in my opinion, and I love this game right now. It's far harder to aim in Fortnite than Battlefield 1 for me, as the controls feel unnatural for some reason, with my biggest realisation being that my controller deadzones are far too large for minute aiming adjustments. 

I'm really just hoping that someone at EPIC sees this and understands this issue facing us at the moment. Anyone else have suggestions on how console controls can be improved? ",FortNiteBR

What if when the battle bus doors open there’s a 1 minute timer and all of a sudden the floor becomes a damaging environment that acts sort of like the storm and it forces you to build and stay elevated.

This would also force more people to land in the center of the circle instead of the edges to prevent people from hiding and then wasting all of their resources to get safe!

Now obviously there would be a few things you might want to implement such as, double resources and also stronger building structures to make what you’re building maybe 2x-4x stronger so it isn’t instantly destroyed, but I could see this as a very strategic / exciting game mode!

I’d love to hear everyone else’s thoughts on this!

The only other weapon in the game capable of **consitantly** one shotting is the bolt action, sure the blue burst can too, but not nearly as reliably or easily, these weapons are also far, far more rare, and one could argue that the bolt is far more difficult to 200hp wipe someone.

I follow this subreddit closely and I play this game very often (150+ hours on xb1) and the current state of the game honestly scares me a bit. I love that the devs are adding things and trying to make the game better but as a result they’ve created a lot of bugs and issues, 
for example:

- never ending reload 
- Delayed gun selecting on initial drops  
- Eliminated players Loot can’t be picked up for a short period of time 
- Building selector placing random pieces( a floor is displayed but stairs are built etc.) 
- Delay when switching from building to weapons (shows a weapon but building is still displayed or vice versa) 
- Building walls and being unable to walk backwards 
- Texture and graphic bugs 
- The number of shrubs is too damn high 
- People coming back to life after elimination 
- Doors being closed when they’re open or vice versa

And the list goes on but you get the point, there’s a lot and instead of adding and potentially creating new issues why not slow down for a second and fix some. I love this game 100% but now it’s more of a battle with the actually game than the players them selves and it’s becoming a frustration to play and not in the get killed by a bush camper in final 3 kinda way.

Edit: thanks for the replies! Keep posting your bugs hopefully some can be patched! 

Other bugs mentioned:
- ghost sniper bullets 
- chests/ammo boxes saying they’re closed when recently opened 
- furniture and objects taking multiple hits to register them being destroyed 
- invisible players 
- chug jugs not registering when consumed

So it's simple....well to me it is, I don't know how difficult something like this is for the Devs?  I'm not great at the game, been playing for a few months now, and bought the full game mid December too. It's amaaaazing! Now... I've been grinding to get a win in BR...since the beginning ,but still, no luck. (About 250 game played.)

""Is he relaxing his shoulders?""

""Ooooooh he's tryin!""

More to the point... I'm yearning to get this win....but I've been finding the ""re-load"" to a new match to be *slow*. I would love to see a ""quick join"" option once I die to dive directly into the training arena of a new game. Sometimes I just want to keep going and going and going, but the break between games is, IMO, an ""inconvenience"". Nothing that it makes me dislike the game in any way..just..yano?

To the rest of the community, what are your thoughts on either a ""Quick-Join"" (once you die, you've an option to join another server) or ""Quick Match"" (Perhaps a game mode that automatically places you in queue for the next available match).

Now sometimes that random teammate is pretty good and pulls their weight (or carries the shit out of us), but the majority of the time its the complete opposite. It's fine if you're still learning the game and trying to get better, but please land where the rest of your team is landing dammit. 90% of the time our random teammate will literally pick the complete opposite direction to land compared to where the three of us put our markers and now we're a man down and they probably die in the first 15 seconds of landing.

I have seen streamers and friends do this and get a little tilted by it. So I think it would be amazing if there was some sort of effect (such as how your whole body has a blue aura around it when your shield gets taken off but longer) that is used to show that the DBNO player is still in the invincibility state. For Example, say you knock a player down and you want to completely kill him, right when the player goes down, he has a blue effect/aura (or whatever) to show that he is in the invincibility state, so you wait until it goes away, then you can shoot and kill the player. It would save that extra bullet and just help in general. (I think that the blue aura caused by the shield[when you drink it or it is taken off] would probably be the best effect for this suggestion, but only just a little bit longer so it would last for the whole invincibility state.)",FortNiteBR

It's no secret that this last update had its fair share of issues coming with it but I think this takes the cake

Epic games cost me a computer

I know I still can't believe it either

But this is true remember all the frame lag that we have during the social parties downtime

Well it caused me to blue screen quite a few times and, during one such time the message MBR corrupted unable to boot appeared

This update is caused so much dissent within the community you can feel it all the way here in Canada and now I am out of my favourite past time because of epic games, I am very poor and I will not be able to afford another computer for a very long time which sucks because I just bought a lot of vbucks

And so I am looking for other people in the same position as me in order to form a class action lawsuit against epic games for breaking my computer and wasting all of our times for several hours I will be sending the invoice to epic games first to see if they will repay me my computer

It's a shame that this game destroyed my computer I was just starting to get good in the game and now I am out of my favourite pastime because of their inadequacy at adding a single item to their game

If any other redditors have any experience in endeavours such as getting my Computer paid back by epic games I would like to know your experience so that I can put all the chances on my side to right this wrong on epic games behalf

They release the patch that supposedly got rid of building delay in the early game,but brought with it the worst bug of all time. 
First of all, the buildings dont render half the the time. Your gun still has a 5-6 second delay before you can use it, and you cant see other peoples gun when they shoot you AND it doesnt make any sound. You have literally zero clue what they have and they kill you with it.
Second, the building is the worst state ive ever seen it. Now, if you select the ramp too quickly, or build too quickly, the game doesnt even fucking put the building choice on the right slot. I quickly build a ramp and then go to switch to a floor, and the game builds a roof and traps me in it. I then quickly switch to a wall to block incoming shots, and it builds a ramp even when im selected on a wall. 
Honorable mentions for bugs: shotgun gltich where youre infinitely reloading, the bug where you literally cannot switch weapons unless you disconnect controller, and the bug where you get shot behind a wall over and over because of desync. This game is in a truly terrible spot right now and I dont know if i can even manage to deal with the bugs. They are all GAME BREAKING bugs that ruin the experience all together. ",FortNiteBR

First the old school CoD games, then my beloved Battlefield series, finally in SWBF2. 

Battlefront 2 really opened my eyes to the ridiculous level consumers are being extorted. I bought the game for $60 because I respect Dice and love Star Wars. I had heard the stink about loot boxes, but didn't really understand star cards and the progression system yet. After playing more than 100 hours of the game, I completely understand it and how broken and greedy the system is. I still loved playing the game, but this little nagging annoyance about loot box progression always stuck in the back of my mind.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago when I first downloaded Fortnite. First of all, its free to play. I didn't feel the need to spend any money in my first few tiers. Then, I became addicted. I started to watch YouTubers play the game to pick up on skills. I then bought the battle pass, because I wanted to support the developers for making such a fun and addicting game. Since then, I have bought two additional items; the 10 tiers that were on sale and the slow clap (the second of which I bought with earned V-bucks). When I spend money in this game, it only has cosmetic value and no in-game benefit. Bravo! When I purchase an item or emote, I know exactly what I am getting with my purchase. Perfect! None of these purchases are necessary, but I think the developer definitely deserves the support and I like the prestige of the cosmetic items. Congratulations, Epic games, you got it right and I will continue to support you guys as long as it stays that way!

tl;dr - Epic games did microtransactions right by only including cosmetic items and not including loot boxes. Will continue to purchase them as long as it stays that way.",FortNiteBR

You guys are sure a talkative bunch, and that’s great! Here are some numbers for you guys.

* We’ve been averaging anywhere from 500k to 4 **MILLION** pageviews a day
* 3000+ posts a day
* 3000+ new subscribers everyday
* We are Top 50 of the fastest growing subreddits across all of Reddit
* On January 26th, we were the fastest growing non-default subreddit of the day

---
However, to help reduce clutter throughout the subreddit, we are going to be implementing daily megathreads with set themes. 

Currently, our plan is have a week that will look something like this

* **Mentor Monday:** A day for seeking advice, especially if you’re new to ForniteBR. Mentors can offer to play a few games with a mentee and show them the ropes.
* **Team Up Tuesday:** Squad up with fellow /r/FortniteBR members. On other days of the week, please remember to use /r/FortniteRoyaleLFG/ to find people to play with.
* **Mid-Week Masterpieces:** Show off your builds! Forts, llamas, designs, mishaps, etc.
* **Think it Up Thursday:** Share your suggestions to improve FortniteBR
* **Free Talk Friday:** Off-topic discussion
* **Strategy Saturday:** Discuss in-game strategy and tips for getting that sweet, sweet Victory Royale
* **Sub Sunday:** “Best of” the subreddit for the week. Share your favorite posts, comments, or highlights from the past week. Winners might receive something special in the future. ;)

Note that we are not limiting discussion to these days. You can suggest improvements for FortniteBR any day of the week, but on Thursday, for example, individual threads with suggestions will be removed and redirected to our megathread.

---
We would also like to welcome back /u/BurlsteinBurl to the mod team after some time off due to real life obligations. He was an integral part of getting both Fortnite subs off the ground, mainly working in the background and is an integral part to the continued amazing relationship the Epic development team has with Reddit we all see everyday. Please give him your thanks and welcome back!

---
Our final announcement is that we have updated/refined our rules found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/rules) to help with the growth of the subreddit. Please check them out and always feel free to give us feedback [via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FFortNiteBR). If you have an issue with the removal of a post, please only use modmail and do not PM the moderator’s inbox or attempt to Reddit chat with them.

Lastly, we need your eyes to help identify offending posts or comments as you see them as we can't see all of the posts and comments on the subreddit. Please use the ""report"" feature any time you think a link, post, or comment might break the subreddit rules.

Thank you all for an amazing place on this subreddit and good luck on getting those Victory Royales!

I'm asking mainly because I'm still grinding to get the black knight and recently when that 10 tier bundle was on sale for $9 I went ahead and purchased $25.00 of V-Bucks.  With the v-buck bonus and some tiers giving 100 v-bucks, I knew I'd have 2,000 V-bucks to get next seasons battle pass on Day 1.  So the only reason I bought the $25.00 bundle was so that I could buy both the 10 tiers and next seasons battle pass.

And since I'm not paying $8 for a skin or able to unlock basic skins through gameplay I don't have much reason to be loyal to the game. It doesn't feel like there is anything to grind for. In games like LoL I initially didn't want to buy skins but the abiltiy to unlock content by playing kept me going until I liked the game enough to spend money on skins and that is how IMO Fortnite should do it.

I feel like if you wear some recognizable skin, the enemies are less confused and are able to keep better track of you. For example, in a situation where you push from one side and then flank/ pop up from another side – if you have a recognizable skin, they'll know for a fact it's you, unlike if you had been using some default skin, which they would then have to think twice whether it's you or a different player.

What's your guys stance? This whole notion is the main reason I've decided to just skip any skin (that doesn't resemble the default ones) whatsoever. I do like the gingerbread man, for instance, and the fact that it's back for the last time this season is why I resurface this topic (between myself and I, but I figured I could hear some more input on the matter). Obviously the prices are pretty expensive, plus, with the constant flow of new skins, it's more than likely that every now and then a nice skin you like will get released, and so you do have to draw the line somewhere (or you don't), but that's a topic that is being discussed rather frequently, so there's no need to bring this up again.",FortNiteBR

General Tips

1.Dont hide in a bush all game , if you cant win, its probably because you're not ready to fight players, land somewhere with good loot and get ready to fight other players. Dont land in small places with 0 other people, you wont improve.You NEED to get used of fighting other players and improving your building skills to win.

2.Bind your keys, the default keys arent the best for building, bind them to something you can press faster, look at all the twitch streamers(most of them) they have all their keys binded I use c for stairs, x for platform and mouse button 4 for wall, i can build really fast with this.

3.Mini shields are the best item to stack, especailly for late game, if you go into late game without any shields, its really hard to win. I like to have 3 meds and 10 mini shields(if i get them)

4.Always have a bolt, theres nothing more powerful than being able to remove someone with one click,if you know how to use the bolt properly then it will win you games, for example you are pushing a guy up in his base, he will peak you and try to shoot you, what you can do is as soon as he peaks u just take your bolt and try to get the headshot

5.Shotgun isnt always ideal for lategame, my favourite loadout is shotgun ar, bolt. but if i find a rocket launcher i would replace it for my shotgun , just because rocket launcher can do SO much more than shotgun late game, you can keep both, but then you will only have one slot for potions and meds.And if someone gets close range to you, be ready to build over them and just blow them up with your rocket launcher :D

6.Use 3rd person, whenever you enter a door, dont just walk straight in, get beside the wall thats next to the door, then open it ,you can see everything inside before you go in.

7.Always have your weapon slots organised, I always have my shotgun in slot 1, ar in slot 2, and bolt in slot 3, this works well for me, try to adapt to your own one. you dont want to be pulling out random items mid fight, you wanna put your gun in one slot and always have it there so you get used of it.

8.Always have atleast 200 wood and 200 bricks, It doesnt matter if its early game or late game, you still need materials to have a better chance of survival, trust me. Dont go farming for 999 wood, just have 200-300, then you can get some kills and get wood from enemies(its what i do)

9.Try to always have high ground if you can,For example if you see a guy up on a hill with a base, then dont try to push him, even if you build up to him he will still be above you before you will be able to kill him and while your building up to him he can just shoot you (but you can try to headshot him with your sniper if you know hes going to peak) just dont try to push people that have the high ground UNLESS you know they didnt see you.

I know this one might be a bit obvious, but after you kill someone (especially in late game)nearly everyone else knows where you are because of sounds, after you kill someone just take what you need, if you need to heal up then build 4 walls and a roof and heal yourself in cover, I cant tell you how many players i've seen heal in the open and its a free kill. after you are done healing i recommend repositioning.
Lastly, NEVER GIVE UP, dont bring yourself down,If you cant get a win, then watch some of the best twitch streamers, see how they play maybe you will learn from your mistakes, Also you cant win every game remember that.

These small tips and tricks might not make you the best fortnite player but i still wanted to help some people out.i hope you learned something if your new.",FortNiteBR

I have absolutely no experience when it comes to shooting games. From what I can make out the game is kind of like hunger games, where you collect weapons and resources and fight to the death; last one remaining wins.

Can someone please guide me to a helpful beginner's guide, or explain the basics of the game from scratch? Like for someone who has no prior experience of such games?

What I have in mind is basically this: I am down to help anyone who is willing to send me some footage of them playing a couple of Fortnite matches. From there I will review the footage, analyze and break it down **step by step** and give you (the viewer) an insight on what you could've done **differently**, what you did **right**, **positioning** what should've been going on in your mind and many other things. 

After I am done, I will upload it to YouTube where you can watch and hopefully you will learn a thing or two which you can then bring to the battlefield next time! 

PS: I am aiming this mostly at the new players of the game, people that want to improve their gamestyle or people who feel like they're stuck and really dont know how they can get better. So if you're a **veteran** or **experienced** player, this might not be for you haha! (of course anyone can watch for entertainment purposes if they wish). 

Background: I've played FortniteBR more or less since it released and from there on played almost daily for more hours than i'd like to admit. In **solo wins** I am currently a top 100 player on console and in **kills** I am top 50.
My playstyle is very aggressive and building is my forte (no pun intended).

""Place top 6 in squads"". Sigh. Let's get this over with. The bus goes down the middle of the map and I land on some trees next to the dirty depot, figuring it was in the middle of the map and the circle had a good chance of settling there. Maybe a minute after I land I hear someone else land. ""Hello?"" I said, but they could not hear me...there's no proximity chat. There I see HIM in all his glory, my fellow companion who henceforth shall be called lord kickass, landed in the same exact tree as me. It was fate, He stood next to me in his shiny red armor and his mighty pick axe. Finally, our eyes met. I tea-bagged as a friendly gesture. He starts showing me all of his cool gestures and dance moves as I sat idly by in amazement, with no moves of my own. The circle kept closing in, as we continued to teabag to pass the time. The circle got out of our tree, but we jumped into another one within the circle, in perfect harmony. Your demeanor changed, you weren't tea bagging or doing the worm any longer.  I had thought that maybe you didn't want to be seen, maybe that was true. The circle finally squeaked out of the trees, I peeked down at my phone and I could not find you. I was worried and looked but the storm was coming so I fell out of the tree and behind some cover. There were only 6 people left at this point, so we both accomplished our goal. After hearing some gun shots there are only 4 people left. I saw something in the distance, it was you, on a roof and somehow snagged a scar. I walked towards you tea-bagging as we used to do as kids, but...you shot me. I stared at my screen stunned that you would do that to me. With my mouth wide open I watch the rest of the game. There's only 3 left and I saw you gun down another soul. 1v1 and as I awaited the outcome...I saw the last person, a defenseless red knight with his pick axe, die behind a tree. I knew you wouldn't kill me, I was just mistaken. I'll never forget you, lord kickass.",FortNiteBR

Let’s cut to the chase. Fortnite (most definitely the BR gamemode) is the reason my favourite game is dying.

Epic Games has moved all of the employees to Fortnite, so Paragon staff is pretty much dead. This is because of the massive boom in players for Fortnite (BR). This means no more development, and the servers will die in April. Listen, Fortnite is a good game, and I’m not calling BR a game on its own, so I’ll refer to it as gamemode. I’ve played it, it’s really fun. But BR has more success than any Epic Game has ever had. In fact, there are more people in the BR subreddit than there is the PVE subreddit, almost double the amount. And that’s saying something. Remember when Fortnite was “Don’t take shelter, make it.” Now it’s: “Oh wowee go play out Battle Royale Game thing.” In fact, when you go onto epic games.com, you don’t even see PVE at all. Just BR. The reason? It’s free. Usually I only see 15 people per match with cool outfits and such. Because it’s free. So is Paragon. But people have spent hundreds on dollars on that game. Unlike Fortnite. At least download Paragon and play at least one game, so Epic Games can be like: “Oh wow a massive boom maybe we shouldn’t abandon Paragon.” Since you have basically killed Paragon, will you try to save it? Come on. The least you can do is sign this petition.

https://www.change.org/p/epic-games-keep-paragon-alive

Thank you all, and goodnight. 

P.S. Don’t hate me for defending something I love. Imagine if this happened to Fortnite. Oh wait, it will. To PVE. BR will be immortalized forever. Well, imagine your favourite game, dying. Promised for another year of cool updates, and then they pull the plug out of nowhere.

I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else recently or in the past? And if so are Epic helpful in resolving the issue? I don't have the money in my bank account in the first place so I'll be forced into overdraft most likely if the payment processes. 

I have already contacted Epic and PayPal to dispute the transactions and try regain security for my accounts. Managed to reset both my Fortnite and PayPal passwords in the process.

The communication with the player base is fine but to constantly read some variation of ""We're working on it!"" when you've pushed out a broken update is sad to hear because it's reflective of the current standard of pushing out contents/updates then fixing them after the fact. 

I as a player would honestly of rather waited two weeks for these patches to be tested and ready to go rather than discovering they are going to break the game the day of implementation. Maybe ya'll are testing these things but if so how come this is still happening?

As any reasonable person would believe that legendary items in the shop are selected randomly, and have a % chance of showing up based on their rarity.  

However, you guys aren't really letting RNG keep Legendary things rare, it seems obvious you are forcing certain items into the item shop and even advertising about them.  Right now the entire item shop is filled with Christmas stuff including the Legendary Nutcracker.  This obviously was not RNG.  I have no problem with you manually selecting what we have in the item shop, what I do have a problem with though, is when you show us as certain items being more rare than others, making us believe we might not be able to get them again so easy, then forcing them into the store manually.  If something is Legendary like the Red Knight, she should have a very limited chance to show up again, not be force in there and advertised.  Same with the Nutcracker and all of the Christmas stuff.  I know you wanted to probably give people their last chance at Christmas items, but showing us how rare something is, then making it not rare at all by messing with the RNG really is a bit misleading to us.  

Also, please refrain from changing the characters we buy.  You changed alot the characters we paid for into waxy plastic looking people, this isn't cool because when we bought them they didn't look like this.  https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7tbrl3/epic_we_dont_like_the_shiny_skins_they_look_like/

We have had a ton of issues and we are working hard to getting them sorted. We can't apologize to our players enough, and you can be sure that we are going to make this right. We can only ask you for your patience. We will likely be taking Fortnite offline for a while so we can work through this. We'll let you know when that will happen. We will update you soon on the next steps.

UPDATE: 11:48 AM The Fortnite party service is down, and Solo and Fill are the only modes available. Players should expect downtime to fix the problem later today.

UPDATE: 1:43 PM Eastern: Our ongoing work on the party issues inadvertently resulted in some players being placed in an incorrect region. This should self correct, but please make sure to check you are on the your correct region before matchmaking! Screenshot: https://imgur.com/a/t84ey

UPDATE 2:18 PM Eastern: Party and Social services are continuing to be impacted. We are investigating ways to mitigate and are continuing to look into the root cause. We are unsure if downtime will be necessary today.

UPDATE 4:15 PM Eastern: Party and Social services are still being impacted, but we are looking into a lead involving network configuration that may be the root cause. We’re doing everything we can to avoid downtime, however, this does still remain a possibility for later.

UPDATE 6:41 PM Eastern: We think we’ve found a fix for these social/friend issues that does not require downtime. Players may have connection/matchmaking issues as we deploy, if this occurs continue to retry. We’ll update again once we’ve started.

UPDATE 9:05 PM Eastern: We’ll be starting the potential fix soon! Remember that during deployment players may experience some temporary connection/matchmaking issues. We’ll update everyone after we’ve released the fix.

UPDATE 11:00 PM Eastern: We’ve released the fix! We’re currently monitoring party/social stability to determine if this was successful. Another update to come soon on whether or not social features have been fully restored. Let us know if you’re still having any problems.

UPDATE 12:07 AM Eastern: So far things are looking good with this fix. If you are still having issues with any social features or parties then please restart your game client. If you continue to have problems after restarting please reach out to us on any of our social media outlets.",FortNiteBR

Just to test some of the software I have available and see how it comes out.**

I didn't have an intention of this, but after some messages after yesterday, I am gauging interest in a possible Fortnite Battle Royale Analyzed youtube series. 

* This would almost echo the way Unit Lost does his Overwatch Analyze videos found here: https://youtu.be/th-q8By79fI 

* **Who am I, and how can I help?**

You may call me Brox, I am a 20 year veteran to competitive online shooters. I've been at World Rank levels from games like Quake 3, Quake 4, CS1.6, CS:S, GE CS:GO, and currently Top 500 in Fortnite BR. I've been around competitive shooters from the day I started online gaming, and feel like I could bring some insight for newer players, or players looking to better themselves at Fortnite.

* **What qualifies me to analyze Fortnite gameplay?**

I am currently in the top 0.2% Duo Win %, Top 0.5% Win % in Solo, and Squads, Top 400 overall PC Win %, Top 200 PC Duo Win %. Essentially if this was Overwatch, I'd be considered a Top 500 player, much like Stylosa being able to speak on a GM level for Overwatch players.

* **Goals of making these videos?**

Simply put, I'd be looking to help those players who keep finding themselves ending 2nd place, or the players who are 500 matches in, but can't seem to get a W, or even the players who have wins, but feel like they are still struggling with specific aspects of their game play.

These videos would then be posted to youtube for everyone to see where they themselves make the same mistakes, and how they can improve.


Anyway, this is just to see if there's interest in the community for this type of video in Fortnite Battle Royale. If there is an overwhelming response, I will set up the parameters for players to submit content for analyzing and will see how well it goes over with the community. 

* **Money Grab?** 

Not at all, I do not stream, I am not asking for any donations, I do not have a patreon, and am not monetized on youtube. This will be purely (at the least initially) something I do to help the community. If it does lead to a moment when someone would like to donate to better the quality of the videos, or just because they enjoy the content it'll be an avenue I look at much later.

And the ultimate fate of Paragon aside... (cries)...Heres whats up.

1. With the Paragon team working on Fortnite, expect a lot of grandiose promises that only sort of come to fruition.

2. Take any statement they make about timetables or positivity with a grain of salt. They outright lied to the Paragon community for months before they came clean.

3. Every major update WILL break the game. It consistently happened every time with Paragon. It was like the internal testing just straight up was skipped 9 times out of 10.

4. This is their biggest success, and they have absolutely no idea how to manage this or keep this up, so be careful about the long term outlook of the game. Remember BR is a side mode that Memed its way into glory, and that StW mode is still...well its hot trash.

Don't take any of this as the fact I dislike EPIC or Fortnite BR. I think EPIC is a lot of passionate dudes who have no idea how to close out the last half of a development cycle is all. They mean well, they do good work, but they really, really seem to be naive and inexperienced when it comes to 'closing the deal'.

Grenade capacity must be limited to 5

You cannot shoot an rpg while jumping (seriously) and you only get 2 rockets. Also if you shoot the last guy and that explosion must do as much damage to you as it did the last guy. You should also both die. No reason for the cheap asshole to get a free win. Its a tie at best.

I've been playing consistently and doing dailies but I've realized that even if I hit lvl 100 and do all dailies I won't be able to complete my battlepass and reach tier 70. When I first bought this battlepass I was in the believe that I could actually obtain these rewards - turns out it's actually impossible without offering more money on buying tier levels. This really pisses me off and I bet a lot of other users feel the same way. I'm not sure why Epic Games don't tell their users that if they buy this battlepass they won't be able to complete it without spending more money. Kind of disgusting service if you ask me.,FortNiteBR

They've done an amazing job creating one of the most fun games I've ever played, while making it free, all while staying clean of the evils greed that plague so many video games currently.

I'm totally fine with the game being down for a period of time for things to be sorted out. Do what you need to do; we all respect your decision given the current state of the game, and will patiently wait for the game we love to come back online.

Coming from the Destiny community where Bungie always finds ways to deflect blame - this was a habit that became common and was a slippery slope. Once the bungie realized they could get away with it, they became lazy.

I'm not comparing apples to oranges here, but plain and simple: the game was playable before the 2.3 upgrade on Thursday, and simply wasn't since. Whether the devs like it or not, the current state of the game is tied directly to that update - one that the community can't help but feel was rushed and poorly tested prior to implementation.

I'm sure the player base numbers are insanely high - and increasing at an unbelievable rate. I know this presents many challenges. But you can't blame your success as your downfall.

There are still known issues that haven't been resolved prior to 2.3. The community does not need *new items* every single week - I believe this is the core element of the problems we are experiencing.

Please devs, do not feel rushed to push something new out each and every week. The loot pool is diminishing in value. We could have all the coolest items in the world, but if certain QoL changes are not made, the player base will dwindle.

Don't be so forward looking, you've already struck gold! Re-solidify your foundation and what got you here!",FortNiteBR

We have had a ton of issues and we are working hard to getting them sorted. We can't apologize to our players enough, and you can be sure that we are going to make this right. We can only ask you for your patience. We will likely be taking Fortnite offline for a while so we can work through this. We'll let you know when that will happen. We will update you soon on the next steps. 

UPDATE: 11:48 AM The Fortnite party service is down, and Solo and Fill are the only modes available. Players should expect downtime to fix the problem later today.

UPDATE: 1:43 PM Eastern: Our ongoing work on the party issues inadvertently resulted in some players being placed in an incorrect region. This should self correct, but please make sure to check you are on the  your correct region before matchmaking!

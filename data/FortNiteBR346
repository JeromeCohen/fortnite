They are just caring about how much money they are gonna make after putting in Orange Justice but they are making this game less competitive. First it was the addition of the ""Short Equip Delay"" which many people fucking hated and despised especially pump users. Before we could edit our buildings and kill the enemy with how fast  the shotgun pullout was, now we can't which means that the enemy could fucking shoot us in the head instead if they are holding out a pump because they won't have to switch.
      This might be something irrelevant to you guys (BUT I FUCKING WANT IT BACK) but they got rid of fast farming. Fast farming is when you switch between your pickaxe and either another weapon or to building while farming materials which made it 2x faster. Getting rid of this and adding the short equip delay really made this game fucking casual and as boring as pubg(not rlly cuz pubg will always be ass)
     Thanks for listening to this long ass post, pls upvote if u also hate the addition of the short equip delay and removal of fast farming.",FortNiteBR

[Here is the link]. (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NdpQoH6jXloQArovFv_lCYkX-6fJXIc379eSdrVMT6w/edit?usp=sharing) Some explanation below for those who haven't seen it before.

1. **You must save a copy to your own Google Drive or download the sheet in order to edit.** No I'm not giving you access to the master sheet - stop asking.

2. The calculator is used to calculate how many daily challenges you still need to do in order to hit tier 100. Alternatively if it's impossible for you to hit tier 100 it will tell you your maximum tier from doing all remaining dailies.

3. You customize the sheet by filling in all the grey cells. They're mostly self-explanatory. You can choose whether to use level 100 or to use your ""predicted"" level when determining how many leveling stars you'll get. It's a pretty simple prediction basically just taking your experience earned and multiplying it by the percent of the season remaining. It doesn't take into account the fact that you get more of an experience bonus as your fier progresses.

4. **The leveling exp is not 100% accurate.** I was given the amounts from another Reddit post and am trying to verify as I level up but I know some are incorrect. Send me a PM if you know any are wrong. I am color-coding the ones I have personally verified.

5. How leveling works: Ten stars for levels that are multiples of 10. Five stars for multiples of five (not including the 10s). Two stars for everything else. Maximum level is 100.

6. There are 500 stars from the weekly challenges in the battle pass. This assumes you're going to get all those stars. If you want, you can change the values in column ""F"" if you think there are some challenges you'll never complete. This will take away from the maximum stars from weekly challenges.

7. There are 20 stars from the ""Starter"" challenges you receive for hitting tier two on the free pass.

As always let me know if anyone has any questions, comments, compliments, or concerns. Thanks to everyone who appreciates these sheets each season!",FortNiteBR

Personally I feel like it kinda spoils the season. I know when I reached 100 last season and did everything I was just like ""what am I aiming for now?"" There's no bragging rights coz everyone knows you paid for it, you've probably spent anywhere between $40\-$150 AUD for it.

On with my theory... I am starting to think that all the changes on the map aren’t really real at all. It is just one big movie set, with all the props, green screens, and cameras set about the island, and is convincing me slowly that the meteor strike wasn’t real. All of it was just used for the movie that is being produced. The “superhero” skins are the actors and the meteor and such were just big props and such.

You can see this in Tilted Towers as well, but the height in the surrounding hills are varied and the towers provide balance and make the height gap smaller. It’s no different than Dusty Depot imo, it doesn’t compete with Tilted, Salty, or Retail when it comes to loot (isn’t that why it was changed in the first place?). I just think that there’s simply not enough there to justify such a change. That’s just my opinion, and I did make this a discussion so please, tell me how you feel, I would love to hear your viewpoint.",FortNiteBR

1. RNG is pathetic: I'd love to know how I can hit a crit on someone with a blue pump and it does 6 damage. I'm a pretty confident player/builder. Let me give this another shot. Nope, another 6 or 20 shot. I'm not saying all of my shots are perfect to the head, but they definitely are accurate enough to do some heavy damage in any other game. What happens after me getting 4-5 consecutive shots? One shotted by the scrub who had no idea what he was doing

2. End of the game stalemates: I really miss the blitz game. I can't stand when you get to the final ~15 and it's just bases spread out doing absolutely nothing. The final 10 literally takes an additional 10 minutes to complete because everyone plays like a million dollars is on the line.

3. This one adds onto the stalemate part. I think we all know that there's always that one base that was built on top of a hill with 50 people left and somehow manages to get the final circle. At this point there's nothing else to do other than rush up. What happens every time? They have scars and rpgs. An infinite amount. The worst part is when I die after, it was their first kill. I'm really not joking when I say this is about 80% of my deaths at the end. 

The RNG needs to be fixed or there needs to be a game mode without shotguns. There also needs to be more rewards for players who actually play the game and engage in fights as opposed to the players who camp the whole time. Maybe permanently add back blitz? When solid gold was out before the gold heavy shotty (aka no shotgun mode) and blitz was around, that's when I got the most wins in a certain period of time. I'd love to hear all of your opinions about this. Feel free to agree, call me a moron, whatever. I also want to clarify that I really enjoy this game. I think Epic is doing a great job.

For days, the avalanche would get bigger and appear lower on the mountain untill the day before Season 5 is released. By then the avalanche would have crashed into the water making a huge tidal wave. The wave would fill Dusty Divot and the other craters.

The next theme for Season 5 would he aquatic/ water. (Or possibly rocks/mining)

Please tell me your thoughts and let me know if this is actually a good idea.

I'll probably post something like this closer to Season 5 so people can give their thoughts closer to the release.

He called me a few minutes ago and said, ""Dude dude dude, you won't believe this but I think Epic games is giving us free us the Battle Pass for free! I even have some cool skins.""

I replied, ""No, buddy. It's not free, I had to pay for mine. I guess somebody got on your account while you were at school and bought it for you.""

Rather than getting hit by a meteor Tilted will be... wait for it... INVADED BY A GIANT DINOSAUR! Cloverfield/Godzilla style!

Evidence:
1) In the center of Dusty Divot is a giant unbreakable meteorite... but what if... that's an egg not a rock.  If you stare at it you can definitely hear some rumbling noise indicating that it's active.

2) Epic has been really pushing dinosaur/monster content with the Rex skin, Dino pickaxe, and more recently Tricera Ops and the Fishbowl dude, So we clearly see that the devs at Epic really love their Monsters so I'm sure they would be 100% down to have a monster related event in their game.

3) Finally if we look at this Reddit Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8g951v/looks_like_something_else_came_with_the_meteors/
We clearly see that's a giant footprint and I feel like this is the most clear indication that something big... REAL BIG is here on the island.

So How's It Gonna Happen.
I believe Epic will pay homage to Cloverfield and Godzilla and destroy a large portion Tilted Tower.  Lot of people have been complaining about T.T. and this would be the perfect way of ""nerfing"" it and I believe it'll happen 1 of 2 ways.

1) A monster is gonna hatch from that egg and rampage to Tilted Towers.  
- This will be a cool opportunity to also create unique landscapes along the path from Dusty to Tilted.  There's still quite a wide expanse of flat land between the two which could use some extra variety.  Also the path could include Loot Lake!  This will allow devs a creative way to finally modify Loot Lake!

2) The Mother/Parent of the will attack the city instead.  
- This would be more inline with the 3rd evidence.  Also a meteor did land in Loot Lake which could be signifying that it might be something like a ""Loot Lake Monster"" homage to Loch Ness.  

I would love either event to happen.  I think it would be a cool way to really make some much anticipated changes to the map. I didn't take the time to edit this post so I hope I didn't make too many mistakes, but what do you guys think?

TL;DR: A Giant Monster will bring down the nerf hammer on Tilted Towers and possibly loot lake.",FortNiteBR

So what if they are all part of a movie. The final evidence I have for you today is the battle pass. In the first couple of tiers there is an emote called popcorn. Where do you get popcorn?

So I think I have enough experience with balance changes to talk about this. When tilted was rumored to be destroyed, I was actually happy they were making a balance change that didn't including adding. But as it turns out, the leaks were right. The meteor hit half of Dusty, and created a new town. Do they not know how to make a balanced game, what the fuck is this? Some people will ask 'whats wrong with tilted?"". The problem is it destroys the mid game. On average 30 players landing tilted, 1/3 of the server. Titled is a long fight that last from late mid game, to early late game. When 1/3 of the server is missing mid game, it ruins the enjoyment, and surprise of the mid game. During the mid game, out of the 60 other players, 30 - 50 tend to die early/early mid game. This should leave half the entire server, but when you add in titled, 1/3 of the server dies, leaving around 10 - 20 other players mid game. This is a huge issue, that the community has been complaining about. But Epic Games, like the money hungry whores they are, added a new town for season 4. That's all they do, add. The point of this post is to make players aware of how out of touch Epic Games is to their audience. If you feel like Dusty wasn't the problem, then say something about it. The reason why you can't find criticism about these changes on Youtube, is because the Youtube Fortnite community has no single person willing to make educational videos about Fortnite. Don't entitled yourself as having the same opinion as a Fortnite Youtuber. They're making millions, of course they're not going to criticize their source of money. Think about these changes yourself, and come up with your own opinion about these changes. If you feel they shouldn't be in the game, say something about it.

Changes I wish they had considered before removing it are:

- Decrease the bullet drop on the arrow
- Decrease the range
- Remove direction marker when hit by an arrow

Not all 3 of these needed to be implemented, but all would have made this weapon much more viable. It was way to hard to hit a target at distance and if you did hit the enemy would see where you are and counter you.

Also adding different ammo types to the crossbow would make it effective (and may be your plan in the future).

I hope you reconsider the weapon and bring it back soon.

P.s. taking away direction markers would be really good for all silenced weapons as there isn't much upside to silenced weapons.",FortNiteBR

I, personally, would like the stairs to be R1 and the floors to be L2. Obviously I know the majority of players are happy with the current keybindings, but I think the community should have the option to change the order of them.

The majority of my friends are not making the switch to Builder Pro because of how hard it is to change muscle memory. People who are still using Combat Pro have reason to want this change; Having to click R1 twice to get from wall to stair is really annoying, specifically when you want to make a staircase up and want to place walls to protect your stairs.

Good riddance to these useless weapons that have been clogging up chests for months. Epic, please vault these and never bring them back.

2) Silenced SMGs - I don't know how many times I have to shoot someone with this gun before they go down. The ONLY time a silenced SMG is useful is when you first land and all your opponents are unarmed. Other than that, good LUCK trying to get a kill, especially if your enemy is full health + full shield. I think that if your gun cannot kill an enemy with a full clip (assuming you have good accuracy) then that gun should not be in the game. Plain and simple! 

3) Revolvers - Who actually gets excited when they land and the first weapon they come across is a revolver? Seriously. Why on Earth would anyone want to use this? It's fucking annoying because every time I pick up a revolver (which happens to be a common occurrence) my enemy always ends up picking up a pump.

I’ve received messages from my biological dad, whom I’ve never met. He had been on Doctor Phil looking for me after the my story went viral on national news (USA 2012 &amp; 2017). My mom told me he was a very bad man who never wanted me. My real dad’s family is saying else wise.  

My mom and step dad had me locked in a bathroom for four years while keeping me starved and beaten and isolated from anything and everyone. She left my real dad. She basically left me. 

The community of Fortnite players, whether your on Reddit or not, has really brought joy to my heart and mind when I’m not sure how to feel. The uplifting humor of players in-game and the hard work of the dev team has truly made Fortnite one of the most memorable games in my life and I don’t have a whole lot of those. 

I hope I didn’t bore you and simply ask, how should I take all this in? The two step sisters I lived with for years, don’t even remember me and we just don’t talk to each other cause we are basically strangers. Now I have a whole side of the family I didn’t even know I had. ",FortNiteBR

-OBJECTIVE-

•Zombies- eliminate all survivors and claim victory
 
•Survivors- eliminate all zombies as a team


-SURVIVORS-

The four survivors spawn on [this mountain](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO-d9-rzKJj5NlEiN8lrFA1BKIs7egiFOHOCgIsBMw4kVdDTYmtDg_-VdqLqSeZxw/photo/AF1QipMuemhHopUuHFYnnbkGzr59bJrLFN_o1LsMSM7W?key=Ml96emRBLVJQS25ZVjVMaUQ2OGk3WGkwRWFNaE1R)

You can revive knocked survivors if they don’t get finished, knocked survivors take 2 damage every second. The best strategy is to stay close to your team and work together.

All survivors will be the [Survival Specialist ](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO-d9-rzKJj5NlEiN8lrFA1BKIs7egiFOHOCgIsBMw4kVdDTYmtDg_-VdqLqSeZxw/photo/AF1QipPIUGFPri0zK5EeNRRi0rkjofjFP_dLBhhGdDIt?key=Ml96emRBLVJQS25ZVjVMaUQ2OGk3WGkwRWFNaE1R) skin so players can easily make out their teammates and enemy’s know who to target. Survivors will also see a white arrow above the heads of their teammates.

Survivors have 8 minutes before storm closes in on the mountain to loot, but be sure to loot fast and get back to the mountain before the zombies do.

Survivors Will Spawn With
•1 Common Assault Rifle
•1 Common Tactical Shotgun
•300 Medium Bullets
•80 Shotgun Shells
•120 Light Bullets
•60 Heavy Bullets
•20 Rockets
•3 Spike Traps
•500 Wood
•500 Brick
•500 Metal
•1 Cozy Campfire
•1 Launch Pad

-ZOMBIES-

Zombies will spawn on all named locations on the edge of the map ex: (Flush Factory, Haunted Hills, Moisty Mire etc.)

Once a survivor kills a zombie the zombie is instantly dead.

All zombies will be the [Ghoul Trooper](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipO-d9-rzKJj5NlEiN8lrFA1BKIs7egiFOHOCgIsBMw4kVdDTYmtDg_-VdqLqSeZxw/photo/AF1QipMJnnU7ILaVS2pCuOCKfETJ46AcyCOqn55-kV0H?key=Ml96emRBLVJQS25ZVjVMaUQ2OGk3WGkwRWFNaE1R) skin so survivors can easily make out who the enemy is, also so zombies can easily tell who not to attack

Zombies cannot pick up weapons/ammo they can only pick up meds 
ex: (Bandaids, Med Kit, Shield Potion etc.)

The best strategy is to surround the survivors in hordes, going in solo will get you killed quickly. Every hit with your pickaxe does 15 dmg, zombies cannot attack other zombies.

Zombies also cannot sprint giving the survivors more time to loot and build a base, but after the storm fully closes in the zombies can sprint making it easier to corner survivors.

-GENERAL-

Storm starts moving 1 minute after survivors and zombies spawn in. The storm takes 8 minutes to close around the mountain and after there is a 2:30 minute intervention before the storm takes 3 minutes to close in fully.

Storm will deal 5 damage until final storm which deals 10 damage every second, so zombies better move to the mountain quick.

If you enable 2FA for your Epic account, it could happen that this specific mail you should receive from Epic Games will never come or come too late.

The meaning for this: You will be locked out of your Epic Games account with no chance of logging back in. 
Luckily, I logged into my account via PSN once and therefore I was able to remove 2FA. 

BE CAREFUL. You rather go for a strong password, keep your overall security on a good level and don't use 2FA until Epic Games delivers something acceptable what isn't a bad joke.

Btw, a special question to Epic Games: I don't know how many people have been locked out of their accounts because of your bad 2FA, but it's time to tackle this problem because it's a serious one.

I just wanted to raise awareness... better think twice about it before you get locked out of your account yourself.

Thank you and have fun dropping down.

I know it was the update that did it, as the moment I loaded S4 the screen appeared windowed and minimized compared to normal, so I think EPIC did something to launch options or graphical settings, because regardless of my resolution or render style the stuttering still persists.

Not only does it give you a lot of fun rewards, but it also gives 1500 VBucks. Since the battle pass itself costs 950 VBucks, that means that once you buy the initial battle pass, you can technically buy an infinite amount of future battle passes without spending a single cent. 

I've never seen anything like it in any other game, and I really hope other game developers see that they don't have to screw over their player base in order to make a good profit. Epic have done an amazing job at setting the standard high and more and more people are flocking to this game. 

Thanks Epic! And for those on the fence about the Battle Pass... Use this new thought process about it as a motivator to pull the trigger :) ",FortNiteBR

Season 4 dropped today and I'm definitely considering the battle pass

My issue is I can't get the battle pass until 30 days from now (for reasons don't ask why)

And I was wondering, If I get the battle pass 30 days from now, Is it still possible to get to tier 100?? (even if I grind everyday from then)

Because by that time I would have missed a ton of daily and weekly challenges and maybe there won't be enough stars left

What is it gonna be once the hype dies out ?

You had two path choice... 

--------------------------------

**Long-term Masterpiece**

either you go the competitive path and reward players for being good / fast / efficient

-----------------------------------

**short term Trending opportunity**

reward slow/lucky playstyle , dumbing down mechanics , lowering the skill gap and overall making it a sluggish game

We all know which path you took .. It's really unfortunate 



A good way to fix all those ''problems'' could have been a SIMPLE addition of a skill based matchmaking .. or even a matchmaking based on the account level.

It's a small but significant reason I love this game.

*BUT* it really sucks trying to unlock a female avatar in this game, especially if you're trying to spend as little in-game money as possible (or if you simply have less time to play). I in **in no way** attribute this to any ill-intent on Epic's part, but rather to a lack of forethought/planning in terms of their rewards and promo-bundles.

If I want an avatar that allows me to play as a male character consistently I can:
*Buy the $5 Starter pack
*Connect a Twitch Prime Account (included with Amazon Prime which nearly half of US households have)
*Connect an Amazon Prime account to a Twitch Prime account (see above)
*Pay for Season 4 Battle Pass and have access to *2* male avatar options right off the bat (S3's Tier 1 was also male)

For a female option I can:
*Connect PS+ account (Console Specific)

Obviously outfits of all genders can be purchased at any time and both male and female options are available for grinding the battle pass rewards but...just getting an entry-level female skin is limited to PS players.

I'm not advocating for big changes, but it would be nice if for Season 5 if the battle pass starts with 2 outfits on Tier 1, one was male and one was female...or maybe they have an option for a male OR female ""Rogue Agent"" for the starter pack so that the low-level entry fee for both genders is $5 rather than $10 for female players (for the cheapest 800 Vbuck skins)...or even just making one of the two Twitch Prime skins a lady. There's lots of options.

Anyway, this isn't a complaint about gender-parity in the overall outfit selection in the game as I think it's pretty well-balanced and I *love* the designs, but placing the female outfits exclusively behind an in-game pay-wall + an in-game *play*-wall (ie. grind to x level on the battle pass to unlock) is...unfortunate for someone wanting to jump in and play as a girl.",FortNiteBR

At first it was a speck in the sky. Then it grew bigger. Campsites were set up and telescopes were pointed towards an unknown object in the sky. 

We all suspected Tilted Towers to take the blunt of the attack from the sky. We all thought the theories, speculation, and the minor Morse code making our controllers vibrate would make it impossible for the meteor to hit anywhere else.

We couldn’t have been anymore wrong. 

When I woke up today I brushed my teeth, took a bath, and grabbed my Trusty No. 2. I put my work uniform on, a grease-stained uniform with a bright red mask and grabbed my soggy bag full of god knows old pizza. And I took off. I landed in Dusty Devot with tears welling in my eyes.

I met someone else who shared my ideology of pacifism in this time of sorrow. He stood with me on the edge of the crater before diving in to grab one of the purple energy crystals to have fun. I followed. He waved. I waved. And then he died. Sniped from exach 123 meters.

I can stream it through my xbox fine using my capture card. 
However, I wanted to stream it and play via my pc so I could crossplay with my ps4 buddies.
I did this but my framerate on stream dropped to 7 fps and it was unwatchable.
I know I could play on 1 pc and then stream from another, but ain't nobody got money for that. especially for a free game.

A buddy told me that if I quit the Epic Game Launcher after Fortnite boots, that could help.

Any other tips?

However, i do think there are some things that break the flow of gameplay. Primarily sniper rifles, shotguns and how easy it is to one-shot with them. Believe me, i enjoy using them, but honestly it feels cheap, and quite honestly i'm not having fun when i use them (and getting one-shot with a sniper when i'm SO CLOSE to victory)

I say this because the way most weapons are designed in battle royale reflect how they work in most fps games, but the main gamemode, save the world plays a lot more like an action-rpg, and i think that it would set fortnite apart from other battle royale games aside from not having drivable cars, and the build system.

I also want to make the distinction that fortnite, and to an extent the battle royale genre is very different from other shooter, and open-world games in that you have to find your weapons, and you dont respwan after you die. Believe it or not this is a HUGE gameplay difference from most other games where you have pre-determined loadouts, or classes of weapons, and you respawn with your selected weapon, or class. When you die, you lose EVERYTHING. And having your weapons taken from you because you rushed into a firefight of like 7 other players, and to nobody's surprise you died. That's understandable. However, when you're piched off by someone who got lucky and got a legenday bolt, and picks you off from 1/2 a mile away with no indication that they were there, and no ability to fight back, and no time to react to the fact that you're dead. Or you're searching a house, and get blasted by someone camping behind a door. It just feels like you were cheated out of a win.

Now I dont say this because i dont like using the shotgun and sniper (i actually really do) it just feels cheap using them, and having them used against me. quite honestly it feels like there needs to be some balance changes so that fights take longer, and are therefore more rewarding, and less dependant on jumping and shooting someone at point blank with a shotgun until someone dies. You shouldn't be required to have a shotgun throughout the entire game in order to have a chance of winning. Mabye have all weapons generally do less damage, or players have more health. Overwatch has a really solid combat system that utilizes this concept  Perhaps introduciong body armour would help with defence from these kinds of weapons. I dont know, but what i do know is that there are some definate balance problems in battle royale that need fixing because of the way the core mechanics of the genre work.

TL:DR, battle royale games have combat similar to an fps but the mechanics of the game dont line up, therefore balance changes concerning damage output need to happen in order to keep the game fair, and balanced.",FortNiteBR

You don't need to hide behind buildings, trees to survive because you build it and it is fucking amazing.

However, I was not at all expecting this gravity stuff coming into the game since Activision tried it in COD and basically killed his own franchise. This game is an out of the box one with crazy guns, grenade, concept where you can do anything that you want. But in a shooting game where you have recoil and gravity for rifles to make it more legit, WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU BRING ANTI\-GRAVITY to the table.

This is obnoxious to the gameplay, what's the purpose of being on highground if anyone can jump over you without building and kill you without spending any ressources?

I really would like to know what y'all think about the anti\-gravity thing.

The gliders are good, I’m not a fan of the tag s’mores and feel they should have added head bling or customisation instead. I like the idea of the challenges unlocking items it gives a better reason to actually complete them, but even then the Skin that can be unlocked is still mighty disappointing to me.

They could have created something completely new to fortnite to suit the alien/ superhero theme. Made it more interactive and fun. As of now it just feels like a big old mess. The theme doesnt suit the map at all, and it just overall feels like all the hype was for nothing.

You get 3 chick skins that are ‘cute’, 1 metrosexual commando guy at like level 90, level 100 is pretty close to the level 1 skin. You can upgrade that level 1 skin which is pretty cool looking so maybe it’ll be the first cool looking rust lord skin because everyone will use it.

The emotes are all pretty garbage because there was so much potential and somehow they top it off with the dance from Napoleon Dynamite. Yeah we got the one dance from our inside thing.. whoo. /s

I don’t even remember the gliders because who gives a shit about gliders, as well as the other useless stuff like sprays and back bling.

On to the map changes. Great, Dusty Depot is now a crater in the ground that for the first couple weeks will be spammed by a bunch of idiots so if you’re good, go there and you’ll get a bunch of kills. Oh yeah, you’ll probably get a bunch of kills shooting idiots who eat the hop rocks. The hop rocks are what happens when a great idea (consumable) is too overthought when they could have just introduced various loot consumables like being able to jump higher or run faster or whatever. Now you consume a rock on the ground while some dude shoots you in the back and if you don’t get shot, you jump up in the air for people to mow you down because if there’s one thing I learned in Fortnite it’s that you should be way up high with no cover and moving slowly. /s

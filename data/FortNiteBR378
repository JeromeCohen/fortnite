Yes there are situations where you need the gun or the ammo.

Yes I understand in the final showdown killing off enemy team\-mates makes sense to take away that advantage.

Yes I understand Downed enemies can give information.

But when your spending 3 grenades and 2 clips just to kill a downed dude when there's 50 alive and your the only remaining member of your squad, its stupidly dumb and you know it. You gain nothing from that kill except a tiny amount of XP and a number, where as the dude you permanently killed now has to sit and watch his team for the next 10 minutes. Its not fun, its just being a dick.

I understand that sometimes killing a downed makes sense, and I'm not upset about occasions like that. its the one when people are obviously so hungry for kills they care about no\-one but themselves.

So please, if your in Squads/Duos and you snipe a guy across the map, don't try and finish him off, kill the rest of his team instead. Its just more fun for everyone. \(*Also the sense of achievement of winning a 1V4 in squads by downing is amazing, if you needed more reasons\)*

If you disagree with me, I want to know about it! What's your personal argument against this.

Also Epic, if you see this, can you make a marker for Downs as well? People love their numbers so much that maybe counting downs will make them less hungry to ruin players experiences. Just a suggestion",FortNiteBR

Everyone complaining that too many people land there and it's ruining the game, what would you prefer? It forces quick deaths at the start of the match, without it you'll just have 100 people spread all over the place stretching the game out longer.

I get people want the building aspect of the game to be more central, but your issue is not with Tilted. There needs to be more mats from harvesting, increase launch pads and supply drops to make it worth it. A place like Tilted needs to exist for this game to function, moving it or making it smaller won't make the game more building oriented. The point is to entice players to land there, not all of us want 40 minute games where you spend the whole time collecting resources only to die to another team after all that time.

A few friends and I recently started up a Fortnite community channel due to the fact we absolutely love the game even though some of us aren't that great at it (definitely not me). I know, you're probably thinking ""Ugh, not another one"", but we aren't like the rest. We spoke about it all through a last week night and decided this will be a no money channel, meaning since it's other people's content, we will not be making a cent! Completely honest, I swear on my left nut!

Unfortunately, we have posted three videos already with clips from streamers and someone (John) wanted to put clickbaity title which I'm going to change soon, but we put the links to the owners' channels and all in the description and if asked by the owners to remove the video, we will. It was just to get the channel started. I was the only one against it. Oh well.

We still have things to set up with the channel, such as a location for clips to efficiently be submitted in the best quality, but that should be set up soon. Just a YouTube message of the clip unlisted or something should do for now.

You can ignore this post entirely, flag it, or whatever. I, and my friends, are just asking you to give us a chance to prove we aren't like those other channels that just do this for profit. We do it for the love of the game and how awesome this community is.

So, check out our channel if you want. It's called ""FortniteHub"" (I know, so original). Here's the link: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7vtkk4-ZQmCtU8IsJApTjg?ab_channel=FortniteHub

They're more instant with exploding than a grenade launcher is, you can almost always get it to go where you want, and you're only reloading one shot. An RPG isn't a shotgun yet in a 1v1 someone would rather shoot at your feet with it like Call of Duty rather than actually do much with it. 

An RPG is useful when versing a team so you can do damage when they're bundled together, or put pressure on someone while your team pushes. I'm sure the developers didn't have intentions that someone was going to spam it at your feet when it's for the win. I hate bringing up skill but that's the lowest of low. I can outbuild most people on PS4, I'm a pretty good AR shot and I know how to build in shotgun battles to make sure I get the advantage. 

But it is such a yawn fest to have to constantly build a new wall or a new platform above my head because explosives McGee needs that easy win. I build all day blocking his shots. But how am I supposed to put shots down when there's already 3 rockets incoming and my wall is already gone? Just increase the reload so people have a fighting chance. Don't make it more rare or reduce it's damage. An RPG does what it should do. *Go boom*. But would it really kill ya to add some more time to that reload? It should be high risk high reward. Not reward, reload, reward, reload, reward, and so on.

The rockets.

The end game in FortniteBR is glaringly dependent on the number of rockets that each team has.  Yes, building is important, gun skills are important, health/shields are important.  However, more than likely the team with more rockets will win the game.  You cannot outbuild a stream of rockets flying at you every 'x' number of seconds that it takes to reload.  I am not suggesting an RPG or grenade launcher damage nerf, because I think that is in a good spot, but let's be honest, being able to carry 100 rockets is a little overkill especially when you can only carry 9 grenades (which bounce more than Flubber, but I will save that for another day) and 10 C4 (which need an explosive radius buff if you ask me, but again another day).

This makes the meta so stale, that even Overwatch is jealous.  

My proposal: limit rocket inventory limit to 15. (I am willing to negotiate on this number, but this seems ok to me).  This will eliminate one team member from firing an infinite number of rockets at the enemy base while they mercilessly scramble to rebuild their fort that the big bad wolf could blow down.  Not only that, but there is no need to waste any other ammo on the fort when you can just stream explosives at them

This would do several things: Improve late game, make it a harder decision to carry C4 or grenades (hell even meds) over RPG/Grenade launcher, and make for some more epic building clashes in the last 2 circles.  

This is such an amazing game and the endgame should proceed more organic with intertwined bases and shotgun battles to the death instead of being totally dependent on rocket volume.  The whole game takes a lot of skill to be good at, but it feels dumbed down at the end when you know there is nothing you can do and 80 rockets are a comin.

TL;DR: Nerf the number of rockets you can carry to improve late-game tactics.",FortNiteBR

I’ve recently been playing and I do run into good people sometimes but lately since like two patches ago, I feel like I’m either getting worst or people are getting better. 

So I decided to test the theory and i made a new account and play a couple of solos and I’m out here dropping 16-19 kills a game when I average like 8-13 kills. Now it can all be in my head but my friend who is pretty good just like me just created an account and now he’s dropping 21-22 kills. To me it’s just weird...

I feel like I’m being put into lobbies with newer players. Sometimes they don’t even build in gunfights and I win majority of my battles. Can anyone else test this theory? I feel like I’m going crazy.

First of all, I would love to thank the community and Epic Games for the amazing game they brought us. I really love it and no way i'm getting it out of my daily routine.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                      
I'm a decent player if I say so myself. I usually get around 3-5 kills and then just end up to die. I normally take a loot lake run, and the loot is pretty decent. Although i've picked up quite a lot of W's, I have a hard time getting into late game. I think I'm building too much in certain occasions where i should be taking out my guns. I've tried many things to get a little better, but I feel like I'm not progressing.                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                      
I see a lot of people telling people that if they want to get good at the game, they should go Tilted Towers. Just those 2 words horrify my pc. I can't land Tilted because my lag is too insane over there. I've tried enough times but i just find myself dying in the first 30 seconds despserately trying to move around with the lag. I know this may seem as something that's a problem for me, but i'm in a financial position where I can't get a new/better pc.

I was having this conversation with my friends the other day and I figured I would ask this sub.

Has EPIC made more money off this game than if they were to have charged for it? I am talking about BR alone, not STW. 

My gut feeling tells me that had this game not been free, it would not have blown up like it has. Thus, with that increase in popularity comes a larger player base, which means more players willing to pay for v-bucks (skins, emotes etc).

Example (and please excuse my rough math):

Had epic sold 500,000 copies of the game, that would have brought in $30m.

Now compare that to the player base of 3,400,000 (http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/05/many-people-play-fortnite-battle-royale-7363495/)... if only a million of those players have spent an average of $30 on the game, that still equates to what they would have brought in had they charged for the game.

This is NOT FACTUAL, but hypothetical. Curious to see what others have to say.

I never really played them much before fortnite.  However playing fortnite over and over again isn't really an efficient way to grind out that skill.  

is there a shooter with similar shooting mechanics to fortnite but with respawns so that I can practice more efficiently? perhaps some good fortnite players can recommenced some games that they came from before fortnite? thanks.  ",FortNiteBR

A lot of people miss it, myself included.  I liked the increased mats, I liked the increased loot spawn, and I liked the immediate fight for your life mentality.  I also like the base Battle Royale game mode.  I understand some don't, but hear me out:

The biggest issue people have with the base game mode is the mid-game.  They don't like having to search for fights, and they don't like the walking simulator it can be.  I think this can pretty much all be traced back to Tilted Towers and the 60 people who land there every time they can.  I don't propose removing the city, it's a great part of the map regardless of what my framerate tells me.  I propose something different.

PUBG has two early hot drop spots: School, which I feel is similar to Tilted Towers, and Military Island.  This means that instead of a one-man-survives fight in one area, there are bigger fights in two areas with more making it out, creating a potentially more interesting mid-game.  Fortnite should do something similar.

I want an island in the southeast of the map, separated completely from the main land, only accessible by permanently placed jump pads.  The loot tier on the island is medium-high, and spawn rate is medium, with a higher spawn rate for some lower tier loot.  

The jump pads would act like the bridges from Military to the mainland in PUBG, where people could try to camp them, and it would be a risk going there, but it'd be worth it if you did.

This is a rough idea I've tossed around with some friends for a while now.  Let me know what you think.",FortNiteBR

Ammo Drops: 300x X bullets drop everywhere on the map

Health drops: medkits fall everywhere on the map

Map Reveal: for a brief amount of time, everyone’s locations are revealed on the map.

Insta-death storm: for a brief amount of time the storm will turn a bloody red color, anyone whose in the storm at this time die instantly (probably lasts for 30 seconds)

Weapon drops: the same weapon drops everywhere on the map

Storm rush: the storm closes in super quick 

Moon gravity: for a brief amount of time people can jump around fairly high like they’re on the moon. (Projectiles also change gravity) 

Super speed: everybody can run twice as fast for a brief amount of time 

Location wipe: a named location within the safe zone gets all of its materials destroyed automatically. 

Damage increase: everyone’s weapon’s dmg output increases by 25% for a brief time

Sky teleport: everyone gets teleported back up to the sky and drop back down.

Super pickaxe: pickaxes eliminate people/ destroy materials in 1 hit for a brief amount of time.

Infinity ammo: for 15 seconds everybody has infinite ammo then goes back to your normal amount when it’s done.

RAGING RAMPAGE: FOR 10 SECONDS YOU HAVE A LIMITLESS CLIP/PROJECTILE SUPPLY - so go out there and mow your opponent down with your purple tactical smg, or overwhelm them with your non-stop grenade launching action OR MAYBE BOUNCE THEM FROM A HILL AND OFF A CLIFF WITH MULTIPLE PULSE BOMBS

Eagle eye: for a brief amount of time every non-shotgun weapon increases its range and perfect accuracy while moving (every weapon shoots perfectly straight with no weapon spread) making any gun a sniper of its own respect. (I’d suggest a mini gun while this lasts)

Anyways that’s most I can think of, if you guys have any random events yourselves throw em in here

Sure you may have 1 or 2 wins and be an amazing player but you can also have 30 wins and still be a doodoo bush camping scrub. I think that there should be a new mode that puts players face to face, 1v1, mano a mano in a small arena with max mats and weapons of their choice and battle to the death (of course you should also be able to invite your friends to a 1v1). Just think for a moment, imagine that one annoying kid in your squad that gets carried through every match thinking he is the best player that has ever step foot on the server. There really isn't any way to prove to them that you are better other than getting more kills but they will still blame you for stealing all the kills. This is where the proposed game mode comes in. Challenge the filthy scrub to a battle and wreck him. Prove once and for all that you are the better player. Of course, this isn't the only application this game mode can be used for. You can use it to get better at building and try out new metas with your friends. In all seriousness, I think that this really should be implemented into fortnite online.

  I can’t be the only person who literally has no trouble getting any materials. Start of the game, sure, I’ll limit myself to what I find in chests and then knock a few trees to get what I need to survive. Rush ramps and shooting blinds mostly. But once I get 2 or three kills I’ll more then likely end up with several hundred of each. Use 100 wood to kill 2 more people, easy 200+ of every mat. Maybe it’s because I’m not on PC so we don’t have those abstract building fights going on. But have you ever really *needed* to have 999 of each material on deck? It’s nice, sure.

- **If you did not own the Season 2 Battle Pass:**
You must have completed at least 8 daily challenges already in order to reach tier 100 without needing to buy tiers. 

- **If you did own the Season 2 Battle Pass and got the 5 free tiers:**
You must start working on daily challenges on March 28 in order to reach tier 100 without needing to buy tiers.

This assumes that you complete all weekly challenges and reach level 100. Assuming the xp per level is the same as last season, reaching level 100 from level 80 takes as much xp as going from level 1 to level 80. This means it may not be feasible for you to reach level 100 depending on how much time you can play. If you only reach level 80 you would need an additional 12 daily challenges completed. **Edit: This is your player level, not your Battle Pass tier. So player level 80, not tier 80**

When you get shot in the back by a scar, you immediately turn around and build walls and a ramp (if your experienced) 

Without bloom the person's shots would be perfectly accurate and you would be dead before you have time to place the wall, which would be much more infuriating.

Other people must have had this idea, maybe it’s some how not possible?

(FYI I play on Xbox so substitute any controls I might say to PS4)

Firstly change Building from the Scroll feature to specific buttons

This only configuration I can think of where this is possible is LB,RB,Y,X

You could have LB as walls, RB as ramps, X as Floors and Y as Roofs/triangles. This configuration is fluid and you could have it in any other order if you’d like but this way you don’t have to thumb off of the analog stick to build walls and ramps ( The most used building items)

None Of these buttons overlap while in building mode apart from X. (In building mode X is traps). 

So I recommend to change this traps now become Down on the D pad. This means you can no longer emote while in building mode. ( Not a massive sacrifice)

There is still one problem with this configuration that combat pro also suffers from, When in building mode you are unable to crouch/un crouch because the rotate button is the same as the crouch button (RS). 

I recommend changing the rotate button to left AND right on the D pad. These buttons are currently not in use and this would mean that you could start by rotating your building item left or right (instead of scrolling). This would then also allow you to crouch/uncrouch in building mode.

I think a better solution to the console building problem is to just allow us to configure our own controls, but I am aware that this is hard to do in console.

Please upvote, repost, share and tweet about this. I don’t care what you do as long as this gets implemented into the game.

I don't say they are OP but they offer way too much utility for their rarity. The white pump is way too good to be grey for example.I think just making them rarer is one solution to not have every fight be who can one-shot someone faster with the pump or tactical

Now, while I do not play fortnite so much myself, I find that shotguns are exclusively favored over smgs, full auto ars are almost exclusively favored over burst fire rifles and absolutely favored over scoped ars. This would be fine if the weapons were viable in their own right, but as it stands it is not the case. Instead it is the undeniable and godsent meta. Let me just say this: any meta in any game that puts the necessity of having a certain type of weapon over personal choice gets very stale, very quickly. Take a look at rust. AKs are the only thing that anyone uses, and people are constantly complaining about it. Now looking at a game that many of you may have a go at, *sigh* Phantom Forces has the best meta game I have ever seen. There. Laugh at me. I play Roblox. Hear me out. I always find myself coming back to that game because it is FUN. This, in my eyes, is because there is not a single objectively bad weapon. It instead is focused solely around personal choice. Now, I am completely fine with pistols being objectively awful. That is okay. But the thing is that weapons of the same range/type should be balanced enough to not have one objectively better or worse. And I know, there is a certain progression system as you get closer to the endgame. But that is what weapon tiers are for. Weapons of the same tier+type as each other should ultimately come down to what the player likes better and them both being viable options, instead of falling victim to the meta. That is all.

I made this post because I haven't really said anything on Reddit about my opinion about fortnite and why, so here is a list of why I don't like fortnite. Oh also I don't play fortnite, I just follow fortnite:

• Maps aren't randomly generated, where's the variety of arenas?

• Because the maps aren't randomly generated, it probably gets old going to the same spot to get loot.

• Hiding in a bush makes no sense! Nobody does that so why add that in?

• Everyone talks about it, can I please go one day without hearing someone talk about getting first?

• It's a free to play game with loot that costs out of game money. Can there just be a game where I can unlock everything for free (of course by playing the game a lot)

• Most of the time, you place ~80th because of some tryhard player.

• People complain about placing second. Seriously getting 2nd out of 100 people is a big accomplishment yet nobody cares about it!

• Fortnite on mobile isn't compatible on iPhone 5C.

• The controls on fortnite mobile make no sense! How do you play fortnite (and win) with horrible controls!

• Fortnite is a ripoff of PubG

• PubG is a ripoff of Fortnite

• The game is taking over twitch! (and partially YouTube)

• Because you find randomly generated loot, you might not find the gun you like the most, which means in order to be good at the game, you need to know how to use every type of gun at least a little bit.

• People die mostly because others find loot and then ambush said player.

• It's overrated.

There's probably many more reasons, but that's a few to note out. Say what you want, but I think fortnite is not a good game. Thanks for at least listening.

My personal opinion: I don’t really understand why people don’t expect to not be finished. The whole point of the game is to eliminate the enemy and get the kill. While I *fully* understand how annoying it is to get finished and have to sit there and watch your squad for the rest of the game, I just kind of expect it nine times out of ten. Why would my enemy want to risk allowing my team to revive me? That would only put them at a disadvantage. I understand the whole concept of leaving the downed player alive to serve as bait for their team mates, but like I said, eliminating the enemy as quickly as possible just kind of seems to be the point of the game.

Since the last update pump shotguns behave very strangely after weapon switching. 

How to reproduce:

1.	shoot Pump shotgun for first time
2.	Switch to different weapon (any weapon will do) before the pump gets cocked
3.	Switch back to pump shotgun
4.	shotgun gets cocked
5.	after the animation is done and the audio effect played you should be able to shoot right away

Now you will notice that there is a significant delay approximately 0.5 to 1 second before the shotgun will actually fire again. 

This has cost me several battles because I left my cover to aim and shoot but by the time the gun actually fires my aim was way off and I probably got hit myself. 

First I was confused and thought my weapon feeling was off. But in Ninjas stream yesterday he lost a battle due to the exact problem and said that this is certainly not intended with the double pump nerf.

I’d go through my replay folder to show you but unfortunately it is hard to tell exactly when you are clicking your mouse button in relation to the shots being fired. It just looks like I am stupidly jumping out of my tower aiming at a players head without shooting. 

If someone can provide proof or has encountered the same issue please respond. I’ve searched the sub the last couple of days for this issue but found almost nothing. Most people seem to assume that this just is intended behavior after the double pump nerf. ",FortNiteBR

In my honest opinion, there’s no point in Fortnite being on mobile (atm). I believe this because of building. It’s almost non existent on mobile. If you do see building it’s usually to get a above a hill or make a 2 foot tower to camp in. You see buildings but not build offs is what I’m trying to say.

When I play Fortnite Mobile, it doesn’t feel like I’m playing Fortnite. It just feels like I’m playing any other Battle Royale. What I like about Fortnite is the fast pace and the building aspect, it brings something different to the table and requires skill. Which is something hard to do on mobile, at least the way they have it now. So people just bush camp or build something and camp in it, for that I’ll just play Pubg. Now, I don’t think we will ever be able to build as fast as someone on PC. But I would like to have mini build offs at least. I haven’t thought of any good ways to make it easier or better, but hoping Epic can maybe come up with something or even you guys could give ideas. Because right now I’d just rather play Pubg, since that’s what Fortnite Mobile feels like.

Launch pads. Of course, we probably don't need quite as many as we get in blitz, because come end game, everyone can have anywhere from 2-5 launch pads and it's just hectic. But, a slight increase in launch pad drops in normal games will allow for more aggressive as well as defensive plays that we typically don't have access to.

Launch pads open up more aggressive options in gunfights, allow us to re-position if we get into a sticky situation, and get into the zone if it's closing in on the opposite side of the map after a tough firefight. 

This also may be able to help in the future if they implement the shooting test changes, as since that prompted a more passive playstyle with the need to stand still to get the shot accuracy, more launch pads could counteract that defensive form of play.

That's just my opinion though, and I'd love to hear what everyone else thinks on the issue. I say this is the only thing that should be implemented since it can be a bit obnoxious when you're trying to break a base but they have 3,000 materials to lay down, zone times doesn't give anyone a break, and it tends to close off a third of the map right off of the bat which I find rather constricting.",FortNiteBR

All of  your games are spectacular, if not always received well commercially. UT2004 was the first game that captured an obsession in me. 

There really is no arena shooters in the scene at the moment, and I would really love to see Unreal Tournament make a return. Or, at the very least, can you update it to the current engine, so that your recently released paragon assets are compatible, so that the community can make use of them?

While we all love and enjoy Fortnite, variety is the spice of life and the quality of Epics games are unparalleled. After seeing first hand your performance as a developer, Im sure many of fortnites fans would be more than willing to engage with some of your other projects. 

The competitive nature, looting, lack of loadouts or player progression and equal level playing field of the recent trend of BR games, is almost identical to what people get out of traditional arena shooters. 

I know me, and many others have been enjoying this new trend of BR games primarily due to its similar feel to games like quake, UT and original halo games like CE. 

I believe that an arena shooter would offer the same sort of equal playing field, jump right in, competitive excitement as fortnite BR, while increasing active gameplay encounters and reducing the time between memorable and exciting moments. 

Im sure everyone would be happy with whatever pricing model you choose to approach for this type of game, as youve displayed that youve been able to create a fair revenue model that doesnt impact gameplay,  unlike many other publishers.

Anyway, probably not the best place to post this, but it is relevant to Fortnite as it seems to have consumed a lot of your focus, and you appear to be fairly active on this subreddit.

peace out, much love. bring back the arena shooter.

This makes me so so extremely sad as I have so much fun playing it but in the past hour alone I have experienced more and more game breaking lag than ever before. 

30 minutes ago I land in Salty, pick up a pistol and shoot a guy with a pump and land 10/16 shots in the magazine. However he does not drop, and instead the game updates to the point where i have 7 health, and mr pump and dump is now behind me, in a full on ""Omae wa mou shindeiru"" moment complete with me yelling ""What? WHAT DO YOU MEAN"" in a full on tilt moment.

And just five minutes ago in a game of squads, in the middle of a firefight outside Greasy in last ~25 players, I am getting pushed all over the hill in a nasty rubber band situation, and then after ramping and walling up 2 or 3 tiles, while standing completely still, my character warps 3 feet forward off the ramp, directly into the enemy sights. And then after nailing some dude in the pump, nothing happens except 4 seconds later an 86 shows up in that bright beautiful blue. So I empty a purple tac smg into him. You know what happened Epic? He goes down, and then why I go to execute him like they did my teammate, none of the shots register, I'm teleported back five feet and see 2 18's pop up over his head. 2. An entire clip. And 33 bullets were lost to desync. That Jonesy should have died with me.

And, for further clarification, in the pistol scenario and the tac smg, you could see the enemy flinching from hits and the little red damage marker(?) thing that shows up when hitting someone. 

TL;DR Epic please please please fix console servers or you're inevitably going to lose players.

Turns out that someone had broken into my account, bought the most expensive V-buck pack and bought EVERY. SINGLE. ITEM in the shop so only 6 400 V-bucks was left when I logged in. I panicked, tried to explain what had happened and I contacted the support asking for help, my pulse was raising because I had no idea what to do so I impulsively deleted my PayPal account so that the theif wouldn’t buy more stuff in my name but as soon as I hit that delete button I regretted it, i have since then contacted the support a 2nd time and I have also created another PayPal account with the same E-mail as before. I still have the reciept and the Epic Games emails from the purchase.
Is this enough proof for a refund?
What can I do?
Have you had any similiar experience with false purchases or people getting into your account?
I want to hear your stories and what solved it for you because I am freaking out about this since I was not the owner of the money spent.

This wasn't a problem from range but as the circle closed there was no counter. Close range rocket jump spam can't be counter on console because building is not quick enough to allow you to block the rocket and get a shot off. It was a clunky skill less fight.

I was playing with my friends and we started talking about season 4 battle pass.  We started talking about ideas for season 4 when I mentioned Roman themed.  It would be  Roman themed so Roman god skins and such.  The Roman foot soldier would be the first skin (similar to the blue knight, ugly-ass astronaut). He would have a red cape as back bling, Roman staff as a harvesting tool, etc.  there would also be Poseidon, his trident would be his harvesting tool.  I don’t know what every skin would be but I know the past one would have to be Zeus, he would have his lighting blades as his harvesting tool.

I could somehow recognize some sounds because he was playing on full volume and I asked him: “hey, what are you playing there” – he replied pretty stubborn: “oh, it's just Fortnite®, all of my schoolmates play this game – it's badass”. I didn't tell him that I also regulary play this game with my guy-friends. (but on PC) When I dropped all the kids off at school after that ride, I left the bus too, leaned at the door and lit a tasty American Spirit Light Green. I noticed the kids playing around at the bus stop and kind of imitating Fortnite guns and several animations etc. – I just shook my head and got back into the bus. When I came home that evening and finished up the tasty Falafel and Hummus that my lovely wife had prepared for me I was just wondering: “why is this necessary – do we really have to design monkey-see-monkey-do games like Fortnite with a military setting”. I feel like it is seriously ruining our youth – especially now that it's not just available on console, PC but also on the smartphone! The kids now always(!) have access to start a small war on 3G! It's just too much. So I got this Idea in my head to simplify these said monkey-see-monkey-do games to their core so they don't have to take place in a virtual warzone with guns and stuff. It's just a concept at the moment but it works something like this: A 2D space, one hundred players. Each player is represented with a tiny circle. The players move around in this said 2D space and when one circle hits another one it consumes that one and thus increases in size. This goes on and on until only one huge circle is left in the 2D space. That huge circle is the winner of the game. Congrats!",FortNiteBR

I Hope at least some of you guys agree with me. I just want to be one of the people to take this message to the developers of this game. We all love this game and We all think it's a great game, We're all here to make it better.
    Now actually to my the point. I think that Tilted Towers ruined Fornite. And by ruined I don't mean that I'm going to stop playing it. It got way worse than it used to be. 
   One of the reasons we prefer this game over any other battle royale game is it's fast paced gameplay. And I think thats what has been missing from this game in the last couple of weeks.
  Back then the games were like this.
 -Land Salty, Get 5-6 kills, Walk East, Get 3-4 kills, Get to the center, Kill 3-4 People, End the game with about 2-3 kills. And there you have a nice 19-20 kill game
  Now it's more like
-Land at Salty Springs, Get 1-2 kill, Move North, Get 1 kill, Move to the center, get 2-3 kills, End the game with 1-2 kills. And in total a boring 9 kill game. 
  And i'm really sad to admit this and I think that a lot of people agree.
  Long story short I just wanted to stay that 1/3 of the server landing just Tilted Towers is ruining the fun, the intensity of the game. This game almost got everything right! Free-to-play, Cosmetic only items, The Fun Squad Games, 200+ FPS and its sad that something like this is ruining the overall experience. No one likes to run around 15 minutes for nothing.
       The only solution is to completely get rid of it or make it much smaller and move to the edge of the map and I really hope that in the next update alongside all the cool stuff they add there's gonna be a patch note line dedicated to Tilted Towers.
   Even if Tilted Towers doesn't get removed I hope there will be some people out there that will agree with me. Thanks for anyone that actually read it through. Have a great day.

The new shooting model is very simple, and easy to understand if you even glance at it for half a second. (See image: https://imgur.com/vBrnod1) The shooting model makes the pellets ALWAYS shoot in the same spots, so depending on your distance to the target, it will be easier or harder to land every pellet, and if your crosshairs are centered at close range, they will hit for sure. Each pellet deals 6 damage and there are 12, which adds up to 72 (purple TAC). The blue TAC will be missing a random pellet, and the green will be missing 2 random pellets, bringing them down to 66 and 60 damage, but more reliable. This makes the Heavy Shotgun a bit more reasonable with its damage, while also making the low tier TACs slightly weaker but more reliable! This nerfs them slightly but dramatically buffs them and makes them worth using.

The pump can use the same shooting model but with 6 pellets that deal 16 damage (subtract 1 off the total damage) for 95 damage on the green pump, while the white one deals 15 damage per pellet at 90 damage with a full hit. Again, this makes them deal more consistent damage based on your crosshair centering, rather than ""Did the pellets actually go near the middle, or did literally every single one go to the top right corner where they will miss so I deal 0 damage at point blank?"" 

The next part of the shooting model is range. This image has a handy set of walls so you can eye measure the distances I'm talking about. https://imgur.com/NhmJUo1

From 1.5 tiles away or closer, both shotguns will deal 100% damage. 
Between 1.5 and 2 tiles away, the TAC deals 75% damage while the pump deals 85% damage.
Between 2 and 3 tiles away the TAC deals 40% damage, while the pump deals 60%.
Between 3 and 4 tiles away, the TAC deals 10% damage, while the pump deals 20% damage.
Beyond 4 tiles, both shotguns may deal a max of 5 damage with the current range limits they already have.

For the heavy shotgun, it deals full damage up to 2.5 tiles away.
At 2.5 to 4 tiles it deals 50% damage
At 4 to 5 tiles away it deals 25% damage.
Beyond that it caps at 10 damage until it reaches maximum range.

With the added consistency, the tac should deal 1.5x headshot damage, the pump should deal 2.2x headshot damage (so it can still 1 shot at max HP/SHI) and the heavy shotgun should use the current 2.5x.

This makes the shotguns more reliable in very close quarters or inside a structure, but out in the open they start to fall off, leaving the crown of midrange to SMGs and pistols (as it should be) while still allowing them to be threatening enough that someone won't just charge at you.

Let me know what you guys think. Will this solve the current shotgun inconsistency issue? Seriously, the 6-22 damage shots at 1 tile range is ridiculous and extremely frustrating, especially since they are capable of such outrageous damage. No other gun deals a minimum of 6 at point blank but up to 237 at the same distance. Give me feedback on what you read here, and hopefully Epic can get it together and patch shotguns for us all.

I don’t know what a fair amount would be as to how much would be given if someone wins, I would say at most 50 v-bucks per win, or a lower limit of 20 v-bucks per win.

Also, you could probably set a daily limit as to how many v-bucks you can get per day off of these wins, such as maybe having a maximum limit of 200 v-bucks per day, which will result to having to get 4 wins if 50 v-bucks per win is followed.

By having this limit, this would prevent any excessive gain-age of v-bucks, because if there was no limit and someone wins at a constant rate, it would be easy to get one of the rarer skins from the store.

Point is, by having a limit, it would make people work harder to achieve trying to get their favourite skin from the store, and making it a harder time trying to get those epic and legendary cosmetics.",FortNiteBR

I will keep plugging along and enjoy dying the second someone sees me.

However, I'm not sure if I did that right and even if I did, I don't like it being so close. I may not get all the dailies done and wanted to do the tier 100 challenge, which I ideally want to save some time for.

Would it at all be possible to reach tier 100 earlier than the last day without buying tiers? Or am I going to probably have to buy the last few just to be safe?",FortNiteBR

Whenever they add something new I come back and play for a while to try it out which is great, but a new map would open up more possibilities to this game and bring me back wanting more.

(Grappler exists)

They were removed because it was too difficult to punish someone who built up high because they could just place a bouncer and disengage.

A lot of people agreed with epic for this removal even though they liked the item.

Why are people all of a sudden for glider re-deploy when it exacerbates the same ""problems"" that bouncers had?

It gives people the ability to avoid any and all fall damage. Gives everyone instant disengage, and gives everyone the ability to engage a fight / show up to a fight in a matter of seconds.

The relative safety of re-deploy has made sloppy building way less punishable.

The constant disengage available to people in fights has thrown the balance of material gathering / spending way off. You run out of mats too quickly for how long it takes to farm them, and usually wont get many from people you kill.

It's made the value of other mobility items much, much worse. Aside from the grappler which is a separate issue.

Launch pads value is WAY down.

Vehicles value is down, aside from the quadcrasher flying thing.

TLDR: I find it a bit contradictory / hypocritical that people agreed with epic on the removal of bouncers, and also agree on the addition of re-deploy.

Both things happened to push the game in totally opposite directions.",FortniteCompetitive

Glider re-deployment comes out and it affects the comp scene for better. Games are more entertaining, less turtle fest endgame and the most of the pros competing support this change (Poach, myth, cloak, tfue to name a few). 

So Epic listens to the feedback, makes a change that supports the comp scene and listens to the pros and now we get front page posts such as ""pokimane's and nick eh 30 opinion on glider re-deployment"" which no offense to them are casual streamers, not pros.

As you can probably tell, I lean more towards the side of removing the mechanic and reverting the game back to the pre re-deploy era. However, I thought of an idea to keep re-deploy but essentially limit its excessive use, especially in the case of third-partying (which I and many others believe is the main issue with the mechanic). It’d be nice to keep it in some form, because I do agree it is kind of a fun feature to use in the middle battle and this is a way it could still stay in the game but not be excessive.

What I propose is that all mobility items when used activate the re-deployable mechanic. Currently there are a plethora of in-game mobility items that could do this, see list below.

Current Items:

Grappler, shockwaves, bouncers (if brought back, also in port a fortress), volcanos around shadowstones, launch pads (already has this feature), rifts &amp; rifts2go (already has this feature), and balloons, they could even bring back blue impulses if they wanted less rng. (if I missed any let me know)

I believe mobility was balanced when it was tied to items in game, not currently where it can endlessly be spammed. So it would work really how it works now, if you use a shadowstone to pop up in the air you can opt to deploy your chute… or not, but you need an actual item to do so.

Here's how!

***Step 1: Increase shotgun base damage &amp; minimum damage.***

The big flaw right now that bothers us more than anything are single-digit damage shots up close. Shotguns need to HURT in the proper range, and I just don't think the current damage is high enough.

**Suggested changes:**

* Tactical Shotgun: No change
* Pump Shotgun: Increase from 80-85 to 90-95; max headshot dmg 180-190
* Heavy Shotgun: Increase 74-77 to 80-83; headshot multiplier from 2.5 to 2.3x; max headshot dmg 184-191

This accomplishes a couple things. First, it adds more consistency to the pump/heavy shotgun, which will make the guns more enjoyable to use and stronger on their own. The pump hits harder to the body and fires slower, while the heavy boasts better range, faster fire rate, and some slight headshot dmg advantages.

***Step 2: Revert shotgun environmental damage nerf.***

This is a huge nerf that I don't see discussed very often. These nerfs were designed for double-pump/heavy, and with that mechanic being removed, this is no longer necessary. Close-range engagements were drastically changed when shotguns could no longer one-shot wood, and re-introducing that would help counter all of the defensive building going on. It also would help ease the pressure to run an SMG which would be great for inventory flexibility.

**Suggested changes:**

* Tactical Shotgun: 75 DMG to environment
* Pump Shotgun: 125 DMG to environment
* Heavy Shotgun: 125 DMG to environment

If you aim them right you can make a 1x1 or even 2 disappear in one shot. There is literally now counter. You build, RPG, you shoot, well now you're standing in the open and they can shoot you or they just RPG you again. You try to take highground, RPG, you play lowground, RPG. You can just build until they run out of ammo or you run out of mats. The only other option is to glide away (exposing yourself in the air and likely having them follow you) or getting close enough for them to not want to fire their RPG.

Getting close doesn't work, however. Again, you build, RPG. I've fought multiple decent players with RPGs that just take highground and then never let go because they can just fire down on you. And even if you get highground on them they just shoot you down. I really don't see a counter to explosives or the RPG in particular and I think they need to be vaulted or nerfed.

&amp;#x200B;

I see people complaining about shotgun doing 7 damages EVERYWHERE, from noobs to pros, and I just can't understand how people haven't understand yet that if your shotgun does 7 damages that means you were badly aiming, simple as that.  
There is no such thing as ""a shotgun Headshot at point blank range doing 7 damages"" whatsoever.  
The only thing that comes close is ghost shots which is worse, so yeah you might actually do ZERO damages on some rare instances but I don't get how everyone still can think there is something wrong with the game when now the hitmarkers show clearly how many pellets hit.  


And I don't mean to brag, but I rarely hit 7 damages with my shotguns. Shotguns and flickshots happen to be one of my main strenght in the game. Maybe this is no coincidence. And that's not me. how often do you see Daequan hit a 7 damage shotgun ? Occasionally, sure, but rarely. How often is Dae likely to miss a shotgun shot while still being almost on target, causing a -7 damage ? Again, occasionally. Not to often. And Dae gets poor shotgun damages occasionally but not to often. And again, I don't think this is a coincidence either that the best shotgun aimers rarely do these small damages while those who struggle a bit more experience this more.  
I do miss shots completely on occasions of course and like everyone I do 7 or 16 damages.  
But everytime if I go check the replay after it, in slow-mo or sometimes even at regular speed, it'll turn out even if I originally THOUGHT that was a clean headshot right on target, well, it wasn't. Even on live streaming most of the time it's actually pretty obvious when you're watching if you're paying attention, that a &lt;20 damage shotgun shot was just a missed shot. Yet people choose to not even try to   


Either I did the right amount of flicking but pressed the mouse too late or too soon which explain why I originally though I was hitting the target, either I missed by flicking too far or not enough, or in some cases I have to say the desync causes the movements to be pretty random and unpredictable making it hard to hit a target. But pretty sure that not even 1/10 instance of the people complaining about poor shotgun damages is caused by this.  


And the problem is, so many pro players continue to blame the game for poor shotgun damages, because they can't even imagine like missing a shot, and because of that, obviously, many players are gonna continue believing shotgun damages are broken.  
They are NOT. Just hit your shots. Just because you're whoever famous streamer doesn't mean you'll never miss shots so yeah -7 might be your fault, not the game's.

&amp;#x200B;

I do agree though that shotguns could use a little buff, but they are still capable of doing nasty damages. I'm actually personally fine with how the pump and heavy are right now, since the SmGs are not that OP anymore. Basicall goes like this : Peak SmGs &gt;= Peak shotgun (double pump) &gt; Current SmGs &gt;= Current Shotgun more or less imo. While shotgun can perform very well with building and jumping unlike SmGs which will always give them an edge in many situations and make them as mandatory as ever.

  
The Tac really needs a buff imo as its range is extremely poor, and the grey one in particular is atrocious. The crosshair is also huge which makes it harder imo to aim but maybe that's just me. The heavy is extremeley strong, super strong.   
Also tbh the pump could use a rate of fire buff. Now that it doesn't one shot anymore, and double pump is not even possible one will often find themselves in a situation where they have to chose between grey tac and green pump as a solo weapon, and both are terrible. And now that 200+ damages are not possible anymore with a pump shotgun I don't think it should still have this terrible rate of fire. I understand that the heavy is supposed to outclass the pump in that regard, but you can still bump the Pump's rate while still keeping it inferior to the heavy's, not to mention the heavy will still heavily (lol) outclass it because of far superior range and superior HS damages and also better clip capacity.

About the double barrel well I think it should just be vaulted personally. Either way I'm fine with it right now. It's not too OP like it used to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, I think the double pump delay should not exist for when switching from any shotgun to a tac. The tac is not stronger than SmGs and there is no delay when switching from a pump to an SmG so yeah...No reason for this delay to exist for the tac anymore. It would be easy to make it like this :

\-tac to any other shotgun : Delay

\-Other shotgun to other shotgun : Delay

\-Other shotgun to tac : No delay

\-Bring back double pistol : No delay  


Tl;dr : Poor shotgun damages at close range is the results of bad aiming, not the game being broken. Pump is still okay and can do huge damages but could be a little better, heavy is super strong and perfect as it is. Make Tac great again, allow us to Pump to tac but not the other way around. Double Barrel =&gt; vault (and bring back double pistols btw with less bloom, even if that means less damage to compensate)

Another option I could see as a viable solution to increasing the kill incentive in game would go as follows:

Off spawn only common (grey) weapons can be attained from floor loot. Chests on the other hand provide shield/explosives/traps/utilities. Every kill you or your teamate gets automatically upgrades your weapons to the next line of rarity. Essentially, it's impossible to get your hands on better weapons unless you fight.

I obviousally know this idea needs some tweaking as their exists multiple variants of shotguns/ars/snipers etc. but I feel that this for one, would reduce the rng present in the game, and two, make the early and mid game much more active with fights. Much of the end game revolves around positioning and timely decision making but players who have avoided fights the entirety of the game will be at a major disadvatage if they are still holding onto a common/uncommon weapon loadout.",FortniteCompetitive

Right now, I believe the biggest issue is the lack of a ranking system.I feel this is fairly recognized, but it’s still worth mentioning that if Fortnite really wants a solid esports scene, they need a ranking system. Currently the pro players are ones that have made their way through a third party system (FNPL), and then were voted in by other pros. It’s surprising Epic uses this as a pool of pro players to recruit into the skirmish, as third party competitions aren’t generally used as a standard for gameplay in esports, but what is more astonishing to me, is that even if you grind this player run system, and make it to top 5/3 , you may still not even make it. If you have personal beef with the people that run the discords, or a bad reputation because of something that happened, you aren’t allowed in. This seems somewhat biased to me, because these people worked to prove that they were the best, and still are rejected. 

Before I add onto this, I would like to say that this isn’t anything against FNPL. The people there are doing the best they can, but Epic isn’t giving them a lot to work with. 

Another problem I think, is the lack of a solo league. The idea that I have to find a duo or squad in order to practice and show my skill is weird to me. Often other people are unreliable, not as dedicated, or not as skilled. In a game that regularly hosts solo tournaments, you would think that solo league would be more of a priority than squads. It would also give people a reason to try in solo scrims (for practice), and make those more challenging.

Right now, it’s hard to grind in Fortnite. I come from a professional MOBA scene that used elo ranking, and it was much easier to grind that, because it was very clear what you needed to do to succeed. For those that don’t know how elo rankjng works, it’s a pretty standard ranking system that works like this:

Everyone starts at tier 0, and gets matched against other tier 0 players. Winning matches equals points which move you up the ranks. You are regularly matched against people slightly above, and below your tier, and losing to people below your tier makes you lose a lot of points, and losing to people above your tier makes you lose fewer. You win more points for beating people above your tier, and win fewer points for people below yours.

I’m not sure how well this could be worked into a BR that needs 100 people, but the main point of this entire post is that FN needs some sort of solid ranking system.",FortniteCompetitive

With all this said, I'd like everyone in this thread to know that I appreciate opinions that have insight and constructive nature. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am playing this game almost from the beginning and I, as much as everyone else have undergone a lot of positive and negative additions to the game. The community was always split with opinions over which ones to keep and which to remove. Epic cannot afford to accommodate people's personal dislikes and feelings. Things should be seen from both perspectives and judged objectively, especially when a game is on it's way to establish itself as an Esport and accommodate casual playerbase at the same time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Below, I'll try my best to explain why is it good and how can it be better/balanced to fit both pros and casuals.

&amp;#x200B;

 **I started not liking it in the first place, but the more I play with the glider redeploy thing, the more I think it's a good addition to the game because of a couple of reasons:**

​

* It saves you mats because you have control over them and you decide when to disengage if needed
* Gives you the opportunity to attack an enemy from a distance when low on mats
* Can disengage if you encounter those turbo build warriors who don't shoot and only burn away both yours and their mats so it's pointless to kill him after wasting too many mats
* Negates and encourages the third party at the same time. Negates them from a distance and encourages them to fight close. This can benefit you since it can take away the focus of the other guy and vice versa.
* Rotations are better and you can escape those people that shoot you when they're behind or parallel to you in the zone. Those that are willing to die but they'll mess up everything.

**It can be balanced if something like this is implemented within the game**:

* Upon eliminating an opponent, their structures become yours and you can have full control over
* Mats bonus upon eliminating an opponent depending on which zone are you in for example: First zone 50/50/50, Second zone 100/100/100, Third zone 150/150/150 etc. These number are for illustration purpose.
* Numbers on mats awards can be adjusted according to how many you've spent as well, given as a reward at least 30% of what you spent or whatever % fits according to Epic to balance the feature.
* Bring back smoke grenades
* Lower the amount of POI around the map because they create spots for enemies to hide. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's a good addition and it definitely needs to be further optimized/balanced. I understand that this opinion strikes through the core of this sub and the popular opinions and I embraced myself for the downvotes, however I encourage everyone who downvotes to share their perspective to see where have I been wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks everyone for their time to read this detailed post. I appreciate it a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

When I die in situations where I had a clear advantage over the enemy/enemies, lots of times I will automatically think: ""oh it was out of my control, I got outplayed or some bs happened that I could do nothing about."" However, if my scrim partner is spectating me while one of these situations happens, he can easily point out enemy movements/strategies afterwards that I never picked up on while being in the fight. Also, if I watch my replays from my deaths in solos, I can pick up on things that I should have done to win the fight, but this doesn't help because I'm already dead, back in the lobby. Even though I'm reviewing replays and realizing things like ""oh, I shouldn't have edited that floor because it exposed me to unnecessary damage"" or ""I shouldn't have continued trying to contest high ground because I knew my opponent had 100+ health/shields combined while I had only 75 health"" I don't feel like I'm learning anything valuable. I still keep making dumb mistakes that I don't even realize are mistakes while in the moment.

How do I up my situational awareness to improve my overall in-fight game sense? Is it something that only comes with time, or am I just naturally unlucky to have bad situational awareness? Side note: I play m+kb on pc and consider myself on par mechanically with 3 and 4+ kd players since I can hold my own against them in playgrounds.

List of issues:

\- A host does the 5, 3, 1 min warnings. About half of the time the host forgets to do the warnings. I've missed a few queues because of this.

\- No centralized countdown timer. (Time is posted in #east-codes)

\- When the server is overloaded (400+ users) the host and bot audio will cut out. Some of the times the bot countdown doesn't even work.

\- Locating if duos or squads are running is always an issue (I mean just look at #east-chatter -&gt; ""DUOS OR SQUADS?!!?!?"")

&amp;#x200B;

Over the weekend I made a web app that solves all these issues and automates the process: [https://imgur.com/m31kxvi](https://imgur.com/m31kxvi)

&amp;#x200B;

List of features:

\- Announcements / Warnings are kept brief and to the point (warnings will trigger an audio alert)

\- The timer is very clear and obvious. The admin can add time or reset the timer in real time (update is made instantly for all users).

\- Implemented server-side triggers that assures all user timers are up to date.

\- The app can also handle thousands of connections at one time (shoutout to Pusher.js)

&amp;#x200B;

An idea that I have is to allow anyone to create / manage their own timers/countdowns. Let me know if anyone would be interested.

This is how i believe it should work with some mockup numbers.

1st zone: +25 Hp +25 Shield
+50 wood, brick and metal

2nd zone: +50 Hp +50 Shield
+100 wood, brick and metal

3rd zone and forward: +75Hp +75 Shield
+150 wood, brick and metal 


It would work the same as a slurp juice in the span off for example 5 seconds because instant would seem to op.


This fixes/improves:
The 3rd party meta as the advantage of the 3rd party is heavily nerfed.
The midgame camping in pro tournaments.
Actually awards aggressive play and doesn't put aggressive players in a disadvantage.

Putting this in comp because it just doesn't happen to people who can't build at fast/max speed on console.

Essentially if I am building alot of pieces and cranking hard and switch to my weapon it will cause my weapon to fire non stop even though I am not hitting R2.

The only way to make it stop is to switch to build and then open inventory.

Is this happening to other people? Why is it happening?

I have the ps4 pro (Boost mode enabled), turbo building, and then the instant place feature on builder pro (with custom binds) . I personally think with a .8 sensitivity with a 1.4x multiplier for build mode the console just can't handle that many inputs at once and just geeks out.

I think that an arena styled game would be incredibly beneficial to the game, its developers and its players. With this new implementation the developers of the core Fortnite game don't have to do too much extra work, like creating new arena maps. It can just reuse the map that it has now. It would also help developers have concrete data on which items are overpowered and which items need to be looked at, giving them an easier time at balancing.

It also gives an easier-to-manage ranked system, since every game will have a clear set of winners and losers, and a MMR associated with them. The problem of peer created Discords and the internal drama that they hold would no longer be relevant. Fortnite would also have a large community pool to choose from when selecting players for live tournaments and each player would have the information to understand why they weren't selected. Competitive players would also sink more hours into the game because they would then have a quantifiable goal of becoming better than others.

This will also help improve competitive viewership since there would be easy-to-read action, obvious winners and losers, and a smaller playing field which would let viewers always see their favorite players. 

Its regular players would also receive a huge benefit. Players would be matched against their peers, which would make more casual players have a more pleasant experience and more hardcore players would have meaningful fights in every match. 

RNG Win Factor would become close to non-existent because each player now has a set of common rules that apply to all of them. We would also see immediate meta shifts because of new things being found. 4v4 teams could experiment with 1 person being a pack-mule or a medic.Initial out-of-the-bus strategies could be incredibly interesting to see.

All of these things are up for change because I was just jotting down ideas that I've had for a while.

Entries signed with (*) can be changed and are really just arbitrary numbers. 

PS. If there are any game modders/developers that want to start this I'd be glad to take part in it as a backend/server developer. Shoot a PM if interested.

On Fortnite it seems to not only do that but also decrease bloom? I'm not sure if this is just me but having played both PS4/PC Fortnite I could drop 15 kills on both and a majority of my kills would come from an AR on PS4 as I just seem to laser people. On PC I struggle to hit more than 3 shots at times from a whole mag and I consider my aim to be ~~above the average person~~ alright.

I feel as though I have a hard time managing 4 enemies at the same time, and often not sure on what the right move is... generally I do one of 3 things:

- run into the fray with SMG/Shotgun
- shoot enemies (from a good distance) in a 1x1 with an AR or sniper while my team is engaging up close
- establish high ground in the middle of the fight and try to kill enemies with an AR

Generally speaking, I’m not sure what I *should* be doing or what the best play is given the situation. Should I be isolating my targets or should I do as much damage to whichever enemy I can? Should I never leave my 1x1? Should I hang out and the edge and be passive until we establish control? 

For what it’s worth, I lose the majority of shotgun jump fights, and win the majority of snipe/AR fights...

It's already tough for new talent to shine through and they just made it 5x harder because now every bored pro is going to be competing in open league so they can get prizes.   
  
The last thing the community version of ""ranked"" needs is prizes added to it. FNPL is currently the only way for unknown players to make it into the better discords and to make matters worse THERE AREN'T EVEN PRIZES YET. Yup. they are going to completely fuck over the regular players this season and beyond so that the pro-league players can have a chance ""when the time comes?""

I can try to get the discord set up with bots on timers and have it run similarly (solos all day, duos from “x time - x time”, squads after etc. 

Obviously it won’t be nearly as filled as tfues scrims as I don’t have 50k subs but it seems like a lot of people are looking for new NAE scrim lobbies and it’s just a matter of someone simply doing the work.

I personally, never had problems with glider redeploy. If Im fightning somebody and it becomes more than a 1v1, you just have to play more smart instead of just rushing that one guy with double ramp wall.

Some people make arguments that ""why did I learn all those ramp techniques if now I can just get shot out?!?!"" I find that doing ramp floor wall will still give me more advantage than ramping getting shot down. Why? Because If im even 1-2 layers above and they start shooting it down, I can peek them while on my ramp and land an easy headshot or few bodyshots. 

I just honestly think that you guys think of the game as a 1v1 playground build fightning game and are complaining because you cant position yourself at an advantegous position and die.

I just want to see if people or in the same boat as me right now and what they think about the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I consider myself an above average player not amazing but pretty good. \~3kd &amp; 12% win rate. I love this game, even switched to PC to enjoy it more and try to get even better, but I find this game awful in its current state and its becoming a struggle for me to even want to queue another game.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to start with glider redeploy. I think that this is the single worst mechanic ever introduced into the game. I feel like 80% of my deaths not  are due to getting 3rd, 4th and 5th partied. I used to love pushing people and going for kills over wins but now, I don't even want to push people knowing I will probably get glided on by 2 or more players during or after my first fight. Also there is a bug that people look like they are landing but can shoot and that's frustrating too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just to try to see what would happen if I didn't take fights, my friend and I just played to win. We stretched our landings and took little to no fights in our games. We won our first 5 in a row, all with less than 5 kills combined. It was easy but boring. And with redeploy in I feel that the game rewards its more passive players. And I know that the main point of the game is to be the last man standing but I get bored waiting around the whole game just to take the final fight.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think more of the consumables should be vaulted or Epic should increase the chance for shield/med drops from chests.  I'm finding myself without shield more then ever now, and if i survive getting 3rd and 4th partied, I rarely have shield pushing into late game.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I think that Epic is going to fast with adding new stuff without ironing out the bugs in the old stuff. Imo i think they should do an operation health like R6 and try to fix as many bugs as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Before the Halloween/Redeploy update, I felt myself really improving I was consistently getting 13k+ wins and even dropped 18 in a loss in solos. Now I feel like a bot. Thoughts???

Now you may be thinking what about the many rules that are in place? 

I believe that the rules as well as the entry requirements are what allow these scrims to be such high level scrims. The entry requirements mean that you will be constantly facing high level players, with the occasional run in with a pro player. The scrims allow for good end game practice and the rules are in my opinion what allow this to happen. The rules are what separate these high level scrims from FNPL scrims as well as Duo league scrims imo.

Or it may leave you with zero materials after the end of fights and you get jumped on. Or you may argue there is too many mobility items inside the game. But, there's simple fixes to these issues, like increasing material gain, limiting the uses of redeploy, or just vaulting some of the unused mobility items. But other than the fact that it's pretty fun to play with, it gives you extra mobility to get away from the storm, or make a clever play, or anything else.

My initial thoughts are:

(1) Box up as quickly as possible and build up without a roof. Assuming I have a trap, equip the trap and be prepared to place it once they land. 

(2) Ramp up and build protection behind me

(3) drop to low ground and hide 

(4) glider out

For example SCAR deals less damage than AK, but has a lower spread, while on the other hand AK hits like a truck, but after 3 shots it's impossible to control. Similar thing can be said about P90 and Blue SMG and so on.

But not the RPG. Not only does it destroy your builds with such ease, but also deal enormous amount of damage to the player. Someone might say ""Hey, but a person using it can blow himself/herself up and he/she can only have a handful of rockets! What you're talking about?"". Let's be realistic, it's really rare to see someone kill himself/herself, and about the other thing: standard 10-11 rockets is more than enough to kill someone. That leads me to another point: skill involved. There is none with using RPG, since the best tactic is to just spam rockets at enemies' builds or 1x1s, while shooting your normal gun in between the shots. Eventually 1 rocket will slip through your builds and you're either dead or in a very bad position. It rewards bad players and let them fight better players as equals without the building aspect involved (which is the core of the game).

My main goal is to start a discussion on this topic. Personally, I don't have a simple solution for this, nor do I think there is one. I just want you to think about this problem and leave your thoughts/opinions/possible fixes, so we can solve this once and for all.",FortniteCompetitive

That way it's tied to skill since you have to cycle thru items and place. But you can still die to fall damage if you're not skilled enough to place it, you get shot out of your build or you build carelessly and fall.

This way people can still be mobile like before but there's more balance in fights since people will be less quick to play dumb because they can't just jump to redeploy their glider. You can actually just fall if you play dumb.

I don’t really care about people “running”, if you run, I honestly don’t care really, i rarely chase a person running. Ima be blunt, one guy ain’t that serious. If you run, I severely doubt your are gunna end up still wining the game, so the way I see it, you are gunna die eventually. Some ppl try their hardest to kill one person. There has been probably hundreds of times I let people go because it wasn’t that serious or wasn’t worth it because of only one guy. 

One annoying issue before would I would have no time to farm or loot if I end up landing at an area that wasn’t in the circle. I’m very limited in my time, and would have to try to beat the storm. 2 minutes to loot+farm isn’t enough. It’s either or. I may open a few chests and get like 200 mats before I gotta run. Then have to fight with no mats 

Glider redeploy gives me a chance to farm more because I can beat the storm at any time. Places like snobby, junk, wailing, you can actually go to now because even if it’s not the circle you can beat the storm and you can start running as soon as it comes and still make it. so you have an entire area to yourself. 

As far as third parties go, I can survive these now. Thanks to this. 

If this is removed from the game, all that does is finally give me a good reason to stop playing. I don’t play this game much, but this little update makes it worth playing every now and then. So when it’s gone I will definitely not play the game again. So either way I’m good. If it stays, I stay, if it goes, I can finally stop playing this rng crap.

What if a type of kill streak was implemented to the game that encouraged kills. Maybe not attack helicopter type of  kill streaks but more like air drops and healable. 

For example, 5 kills gave the player an air drop you could call and choose were it landed for the chance of shields and weapons. Or a material drop that gave you 150 material for a certain amount of kills. Or 2 kills spawned mini shields.

Just some ideas I’m sure y’all can come up with better kill streaks.

However I do still believe the mechanic should be in the game but with some adjustments. 

Right now you need to be 10 meters above ground to deploy your glider
---

What I'm suggesting is to increase the height required to ten times that. 100 meters as to limit the use drastically and being more punishing on a players mats. If someone shoots out your ramp on the way up, you fall to your death. You can carry ballons as a fail-safe, but this also comes at a cost.

The ballons enable you to get enough height to deploy your glider
---

But since you'd have to have ballons in your inventory instead of say heals or a weapon, you're ""paying"" for this decision too. This would also give the ballons a more meaningful purpose, increasing their ""value"" when determining if you want to exchange them for something more valuable in combat. 

Using the ballons to gain height
---

You're giving up one slot, but on the other hand you're not expending any materials. This would make it pretty balanced since you'd have to consider what you want to leave behind, unless choosing to use enough materials to achieve the redeploy height.

No more running from a fight
---

Players trying to run would have to build up a lot more, expending their mats, and the player attacking can stop them from gliding away by shooting down the ramps. The player can triple ramp up but would cost the player running 400 mats if he's only doing a single ramp, so triple ramping is pretty much out of the question.

After some time there has been lots of negative feedback and positive feedback and I believe that the positives out way the negatives. Lots of people want it removed or nerfed, and I believe NOTHING should change it's overall an amazing feature but if the choice is to be removed, I suggest testing nerfs and seeing how the community responds. So far regarding the negative side of this argument it seems to be mainly the concept of people build battling someone and then gliding away to escape the fight. This is a justifiable negative to glider re-deploy and I think should be a nerf if it comes to changes being made to the mechanic. The fact that you battle someone and burn anywhere from 300 to 2000 mats just to secure a kill but they escape due to them being able to glide away is a triggering aspect. Majority of fights last between 10 seconds to a minute, and if pressure is there enough, kills should be secured before they have the change to glide away.  The amount of times someone actually glides away so the person doesn't get the kill isn't a massive number, it's just a triggering occurrence that happens maybe once or twice a game and it shouldn't be the main reason for it to be removed.  Another negative would be it's less risk to build up very high/single ramp up to rotate around since the way to do it before was to completely secure your ramp up to launch pad. I completely disagree with this and I don't believe it should be a contributing factor into the argument of removing the mechanic. Build battling someone up high sometimes is forced to happen. Whether in squads/duos or solos. In order to survive you have to continuously build and sometimes you get too high where if someone 3rd parties and breaks you down, you're dead and that shouldn't be a fair death. As the game progresses and people improve, killing someone isn't as easy as it was before. People are improving consistently at building and since bouncers are removed there would be no way to survive after a build battle if someone decides to break it down. Previously the person you were battling could just go to the bottom and break it down to kill you as well and glider re-deploy prevents this.  Launch pads are an amazing feature added to the game because it can prevent you from falling to your death if someone has broken your build battle, or simply just for escaping/rotating. Previously to build up and launch pad you needed to secure your ramp in order to prevent someone from shooting you down and dying. Glider Re-deploy saves the extra mats that are normally used (Which is an issue in its own since I think mats farming should be increased as does most of the community) so they can be used in a battle if necessary. Sure you don't get your free kill if you manage to break someone down launch padding, but where is the fun in that? Launch pads are epic rarity and majority of the time, you don't have one. Rotations are faster now since there are launch pads and re-deploy and less people die to zone which increases kill potential for everyone!  Overall the only real negative side is that people can run away and not only can you shoot them as they leave, you can chase them. There's nothing preventing that! Out of all the factors it seems like the positive aspect of it is just far greater than the negatives and I think it should be a permanent mechanic. If there are more negatives or positives you have about this mechanic I would love to hear them but I truly hope epic keeps this mechanic. ",FortniteCompetitive

The issue is that people do not have enough materials or meds/shields to sustain a fight with multiple teams for multiple minutes. 

In my opinion, we need:

To vault the normal Port-a-Fort, leaving more chance for shields, etc.

Remove other unwanted items such as Chillers, Six Shooters, Semi Auto Snipers, and there’s probably more that I can think of

A 15-20% buff in material farming

An increase of shields and meds, for the 2v2s that become the only fight that people flock to

Decarse the smg redicle 
Increase all damage of smg by 1 damage 
Increase the fire rates of all smgs by 0.5 

Make the pump have less pull out time and able to switch.

- How does the constantly moving  circles mechanic impact the advantages of low/mid/high ground?

- Would a never fully closing final circle be a good idea in order to eliminate heal offs? 

- Should the storm do damage to structures like in the 5.40 patch?

At this point the only thing that keeps me playing is the shadow of what the game used to be (and all the money I've invested in to it). I know there's a great game underneeth. Undoubtetly the best multiplayer experience I've played for that matter. But in it's current state the game is just terrible. Why? Because of glider redeploy.

I'm sure everyone is already familiar with the main complaints related to glider redeploy but for what it's worth, I'm going to explain the two biggest ones:

1. No risk of fall damage. This is the most obvious issue and why it sucks is pretty self explanatory. Pre-redeploy you actually had to pay attention to how high you were going in a buildfight. Now you don't even have to think. This also gives you the option to run away at any time which means that you never have to commit to a fight. I run in to this all the time: A guy pushes me. I outbuild him. He skips. I have to chase him down. Worst case scenario he builds up and glides again. Rinse and repeat. This process equals mats wasted and time wasted. 

2. You can rotate from anywhere to anywhere. This takes away a lot of the strategizing that went in to planning your landing. Pre-redeploy landing at the edge of the map to avoid early engagements came with the risk of getting a 'bad zone' and having to rotate far away thus cutting the time that you have for looting. This risk no longer exists. Land where ever, if you get a bad zone just farm a couple extra trees, build up and glide. Not only has glider redeploy made vehicles and launchpads borderline useless, but it has also made third partying absolutely obnoxious. It is pretty much guaranteed that if you fire a bullet in midgame at least one fool is going to come gliding over followed by the next one and the next one and so on until you're dead.

In conclusion the entire flow of the game is just a hot boiling mess.

What I mean by that is, it feels extremely lazy and dare I day resident sleeper to aim like this. A lot of the time I dont even feel like ""aww shit I hit those"" it's more like ""aww shit fortnite hit those""


Am I alone in this? I really wish this mechanic wasnt so good. Makes me feel as if i have to spam my aim in order to aim. I land shots pretty consistently without this mechanic but i feel like on handicapping myself if i dont use it seeing as EVERYONE uses it.


This mixed with bloom I feel as though the only thing in fortnite I can be proud of is my building. Everything else seems so random. Bloom makes it so no matter how good I aim sometimes I'll miss just because the game said so. On the other hand there is this aim assist spam adding to the randomness of my fights. I've been playing since September 2017 and the only thing I truly dont like about fortnite (sometimes) is the gunplay just seems lazy on console.


TLDR: I personally dislike that spamming ADS to acquire targets is meta for controller players and it seems like a very lazy shooting mechanic that doesn't reward the players aim but instead rewards a lazy mechanic.

So my suggestion is. What if all splodes did sub 50 player damage? To me this would make them a lot more balanced and an rpg doesn't one shot early game. I get that it may not be realistic but at least it would reward the use of an actual shotgun close range rather than an rpg.",FortniteCompetitive

262,AirUK,1541849476,9vtmdk,40,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9vtmdk/how_to_improve_the_closerange_meta/,1,HOW TO IMPROVE THE CLOSE-RANGE META,"Atm the close range-meta is extremely underwhelming. This is why so many people make sure they take ar shots before an engagement as shotguns are extremely unreliable when trying to get a kill and smgs are really there to get in someones face when they're turtling; even then you can just use your pickaxe. The meta is not very diverse, basically becoming a tier system. As heavy &gt; pump and P90&gt; Smg. So here are my ideas for making the close-range meta more diverse and interesting.

-Vault the P90, Double Barrel and Normal SMG
These guns don't take a brain to use and they're there just to restrict variety. There is no point in having these weapons as well as they're fairly underwhelming (more specifically the double-barrel). The double-barrel would also become extremely op with these other changes 

-Increase the wood wall health back to 300
-Brick to 400
-Metal to 650
The reason smgs became so dominant is because the health of the walls were so low. This allowed smgs to shred through with easy and what lead the drum gun to become cancer. Metal&gt;brick and brick&gt;wood so metal would be useful

-Add back the drum gun, silenced smg and tac smg
Now the wall health is increased these guns are decent follow up as well as help to fight against turtling. The drum gun is not going to become cancer now that it can't shred through enemy structures. These 3 smgs are different from each other but still fill the same role. The silenced smg may also need a small buff as it could be interesting if it was a semi-ar/smg however it should not be better than the scar.

-Remove the shotgun delay
This increases variety and decreases the time to kill. This increases the pace of the game and lets people choose whether they want to go with either double shotgun or shotgun smg as the smgs are relatively strong.

-Make the pump have 2.5x headshot
The pump is extremely underwhelming as it is slow and deals relatively low damage compared to the heavy. This should make opponents fear an effective one pump if they are not careful. This is relatively balanced as the pump cannot be used for edit shots unlike the tac and heavy. However if 200+ headshot is not an option make the pump to 195+ headshot and remove its take out time so the pump is not overshadowed by the heavy as it deals more damage

-Make the tac have 2.5x headshot
It's kinda stupid for a shotgun to not be able to kill someone at 150 health however the tac should do 160+ not 170+. Also remove the grey tac, there is no use for it other than sucking.

-Increase deagle structure damage.
The deagle should be able to one shot wood walls no matter what and should be able to destroy newly built metal and brick walls. The deagle has a nice place in the current meta and it should stay that way.

What does this do?
Well now there are a multitude of close-range combinations
Double-Heavy
Double-Pump
Heavy-Pump
Heavy-Tac
Pump-Tac
Pump-Tac Smg
Heavy-Tac Smg
etc.
The pump would probably be preffered to be comboed with an smg as it deals more damage though.
Another interesting idea is silent smg, heavy/pump, deagle combo as the smg kinda works as a semi-ar.
This is basically the season 4 meta with a better pump + the deagle. This variety is very interesting.

-

***TL;DR: Give Rocket Launcher higher reload time (4.5 seconds at least). Look for 'Quad Launcher' below and see why Quad Launcher is much more balanced than Rocket Launcher.***

-

But for you nerds who wants this game to actually have a good atmosphere, you may continue reading this as you like. Feedback are welcomed. Thank you.

---
-


### 1) ""A Weapon For Everyone""

-

Reason why Rocket Launcher is the most the controversial weapon is how easy it is to use it, no doubt about it. You aim where you want it and you have splash damage to confirm the hit. Aiming is just 50% at that point. Plus, it's a direct hit type 'splode, no need to wait.

-

Currently, its reload time is [**2.66s (Epic)** / **2.52s (Legendary)**](https://imgur.com/a/jillnl6). That is lower than a [**RARE Bolt Action Sniper**](https://imgur.com/a/BItVkQi).

-


That being said, you can already imagine people are just use that only opportunity when they have the chance. I mean, honestly, I would take that chance too like everyone would. But in terms of balancing, logically, that golden chance shouldn't be taken lightly. It should have its own flaw for having such an outstanding perk where you can just hit enemies with ease.

-

### 2) Drawbacks (Why Every Weapon Has Its Own Flaws/Disadvantage)

It's good to know that you are getting punished for using a risky chance to do a foolish decision. *You 'splode too close, you gonna feel it too.* This is a good feature, no denying about it.

-

*..But it is still not enough.* What if a considerably good player has its hands on it? I'm not talking about good pro player, I'm taking about your average player who understands how to use it (like the other 90%+ of the players who understand how to play this game). That disadvantage where you 'sploded yourself is basically ALMOST nothing at that point. At which point, these *'good'* players barely gets punished for using the Rocket Launcher. 


-

This is why I'm pitching in a **second layer of drawback** for the Rocket Launcher, so people won't use it TOO much and spamming it. So people will try different play, making them a better player and making players to think smart. So players will appreciate how strong the Rocket Launcher is and respect its consequences.

-


---
-


### 3) To make sense for those who thinks ""disadvantage"" in a weapon doesn't exist...

#### *Here are the list of other weapons' drawback and how each of them rewards player differently*:- 

-

**AR** = Bloom, max range of 275m, slight fall damage at long range. 

-

**Burst AR** = Can shoot 3 bullets in one go but lower damage than regular AR, also slight fall damage at long range.

-


**Heavy AR** = Very low fire rate, huge bloom when not tap shooting. Rewards greatly for those with precised aim and trigger discipline.

-

**Tac shotgun** = Wide bullet spread but has good fire rate speed. 


-

**Pump shotgun** = Considerable bullet spread. Higher damage base damage but slower fire rate than tac 

-

**Heavy shotgun** = Lower based damage than pump but has lower spread, better range and higher headshot multiplier (2.5x). Meaning it has reason why it is doesn't have a floor loot, so lesser chance of getting it.

-

**Double Barrel** = VERY LARGE wide spread so low damage when used at medium range but very, very dangerous at close range. Highest damage of all shotgun and quicker second shot. Can 1 shot even when full shield/health.

-

**SMG** = ...Yeah, I don't know what to say about this spammy fuck. 

-

**Pistol** = Great damage fall off in long distance cuz it is meant for close range only, *duh*. Rewards greatly for head shots, *also duh*. Independent fire rate, means that you can shoot it the way you want it. Spam or steady, your choice.

-

**Hand Cannon** = Very low fire rate but rewards greatly in the hands of a steady shooter. (Not to mention cuz of the recent 150 structure damage from previous buff)

-

**Revolver** = A good hybrid of close quarter rapid fire (resulting a bloom introduction) and slower fire rate when aiming medium range target.

-

**Sniper** = 1 shot at a time, bullet drop feature, duh

-

**Auto-sniper** = Lower damage than regular sniper but larger magazine

-

**Scoped AR** = Only good for medium to long, worse at very close range

-

**Thermal AR** = Same but slower than scoped AR, also slightly less bullet but has that infra-red for scouting.

-

**Grenade Launcher** = More 'splode in a second, can destroy large build base but has timer on 'splodes, self inflict damage. Also has unique projectile drop off, so only be useful in certain range and position.

-

**Quad Launcher** = Lower damage than Rocket/Grenade Launcher but has 4 direct hit type 'splodes, making it a considerably a good rocket hybrid. In long range, it goes like an arc, so similar projectile drop off feature like Grenade Launcher but just slightly. Almost go straight when aiming a close range target. So, it has a... 

*oh wow*, well would you look at that... [*it actually has reasonable reload time!*](https://imgur.com/a/vyFYOCV)

&amp;#x200B;

I've played scrims on various scrim 'cords during my time playing Fortnite, and one thing that I, and many other players, have been noticing is the lack of a centralized and accepting competitive community. I often see posts on this subreddit about players not being able to get into the pro 'cord, even if they are very much able and have the ability to compete at such a high level.

&amp;#x200B;

I come from the Counter Strike: Global Offensive Competitive community, where sites like FACEIT and ESEA run the most competitive and known  communities for people looking to get a foot in the pro level scene. By no means will the site be able to do what they have been able to accomplish, as Fortnite doesn't allow as much customization of servers/matches.

&amp;#x200B;

But, much of what I have begun work on does follow in the footsteps of the sites mentioned previously, as I would like my scrim server to have a ranking system which is non-biased and based upon match performance rather than In-Game Earnings. I think that the competitive community would thrive under a system where you can progress in tiers by competing at a high level. And thus, my idea was born.

&amp;#x200B;

Once completed you will be able to:

* Track your scrim stats throughout all scrims you have played.
* Search players and view lifetime and recent scrim stats.
* Rank up based on in game performance and the quality of players you are playing against.
* Discuss match results and chat.
* Create, Manage, and Join Competitive teams.
* Join Solo, Duo, and Squad Leagues.
* Participate in Site Wide Tournaments per Rank and earn store credits. 
* Create Players Tournaments in which other users can participate in.
* Create/Join Other Users Scrims. (Tournament Format: 2v2/1v1)
* Earn site store credits for every Top 3 placement or 10 Kill Matches.
* Site Store with items ranging from Peripherals to Computer Parts to Merchandise.  

The Solo and Duo Tournaments will be in similar format as Keemstars Friday Fortnite. Occasionally we will hold Sabotage tournaments where anything is game, and only kills matter, as these are personally very entertaining.

The Squad Tournaments will use a similar format as used during the Black Ops 4 Duritos Bowl Tournament. The multipliers will be applied to the current game and will not carry over. The squads will have 3 matches to earn as many points as possible.

|*Kills*|*1 point*|
|:-|:-|
|*Top 5* |*+0.5X Multiplier Bonus*|
|*Top 3*|*+0.75x Multiplier Bonus*|
|*1st*|*+1.25 Multiplier Bonus*|

&amp;#x200B;

I have begun development on this site already so be looking for further announcements from me about the progression of the project. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please Discuss below if:

1. There are any features you would like to see added to the project 
2. You don't like any of the features I have mentioned and think they should be trashed.
3. You want something like this.
4. You think this is a good addition to the competitive scene.
5. You just want to give your opinions!
6. You just want to say hi!

Basically the easy kills from before, now are gliding away, resetting the fight every time they lose highground or get shoot. So you and him are wasting more mats, shields AND TIME killing players, what leads to what we are all suffering. Get third partied, a lot.  
And if it was not enough we're suffering the lack of shields and mats, because everyone is keeping alive longer wasting everything they have. So now it's more common to kill someone and don't get shit becasue they already wasted everything in this cycle with you or another player.  


Now my advice to ""win games"" It's simple. Don't fight as much as before, and if you don't have an initial damage with sniper, headshot or whatever maybe it's not the best idea to continue with that fight, especially if there are few people left cuz everyone is gonna focus your ass.  
It's really sad for me because I'm a very aggressive player but we have to adapt, and the number of times I've seen myself with no mats no shields and 4 dudes shooting me from different angles, it's absurd.  
So for this reason I think that in the future, not very far we will begin to see more people avoiding fights, but not the same bots as always doing their 1x1 builds, I am talking about avoiding fights like scrims, rotating and avoiding fights at all costs.   


What do you guys think? What changes would you make so that this does not happen? increase of shields? Some reward for killing players? ",FortniteCompetitive

To me it feels like you aren't supposed to mine any more in this game. Try to mine (especially post-nerf) and you'll probably be punished. No, it's much better to find a sucker who takes the time to mine and gank them.

Dusty Depot is fucking busted now thanks in part to gliders. It has a shit ton of materials up for grabs and it's central enough that you can get almost all of them most of the time. But what happens to me when I go there is I get ambushed over and over again. And I'm likely to survive at least one of these. But each one lowers the amount of health resources I have. Eventually comes along someone who gets up in my face and barely outdoes me.

Close range combat; more often than not it's really just a combination of chance and who has more health. Shotguns are a bit inconsistent, as are SMGs; really only the pistol and heavy ar are guiltless, but arguably at a disadvantage. And don't even get me started on rocket launchers. So many goddamn times I have my gun trained exactly on my target just to die and see my enemy only had like 4 HP left- sometimes because of server lag! **There needs to be some sort of defensive advantage to help fight this sort of situation.** People need to be encouraged to think twice before ambushing. I think hypothetically building would help in these situations but often it's too late, and retreat is hardly ever an option even if you have an item for it, what with how hard it is to build behind you and the plethora of long range weapons. Explosives: often helpful but quite likely to kill your opponent too late or take you both out. I miss C4, honestly.

Plus after I die, when I watch the person who killed me, they very often die to someone using the exact same over-aggro playstyle, relying on them having more resources than their opponent. Even out in the fields this is an issue since people know to build for defense in long range. Then that person is weakened and doesn't quite have the health items to make it somewhere safe and THEY get ganked, and so on.

What this all means is that to make it to late game where the most fun is, you have to avoid conflict entirely until around mid game. (Most of the people who I watch only have 1 or 2 kills.) This is cheap. It is seriously ""let chumps get the good guns and materials near the center of the map, then swoop in and take their shit"" meta. Playing to win and playing tactically feel like increasingly different things. Planning ahead gets you nowhere. What you instead want to do is last long enough to sneak in and cheap shot someone who had to sweat to get to where they are. Effort and skill don't mean much when the formula only requires you be half-decent at guns to get into late game if you know how to game the system.

What I want to know is, why does this game punish you for winning fights? Sure you can farm guns and materials, but you probably need healing most of all, which they're not likely to be carrying. Maybe this game should replenish shield for player kills like with the monsters in Fortnitemares. Perhaps base it on how much damage you had to inflict- 200 damage can become 100 shield or even health. Just an idea. I realize this is likely to encourage last ditch rushes from dudes with like 6 HP but if you die you kind of deserve it.

As for the defensive advantage, I legitimately can't think of anything except getting rid of the switch lag on shotguns and explosives (I fucking hate this, especially on the pump! Never get a goddamn shot in, it's acceptable on the DB and RL though), or making building more appealing again. There is absolutely no killstreak functionality in this game and I think that's a shame. This game has to decide if it's going to encourage or discourage elimination in a meta where midgame is way more crowded than it used to be.

Do you folks agree with me on these things? Or am I just playing it wrong? And if so, how can I improve my strategy? \~\~If you agree, upvote and maybe Epic will see, and feel free to introduce your own suggestions.\~\~ /r/FortniteBR deleted this in like two minutes and this is a repost lol",FortniteCompetitive

295,ErikSlayDama,1541797433,9vo9je,20,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9vo9je/recent_double_shotgun_talks/,1,Recent Double Shotgun Talks,"So if you noticed today, there was a post both on r/FortniteCompetitive and r/FortNiteBR about the fact that Double Pump was confirmed to not be returning anytime soon. But it was surpising that even some people on the main sub said that double shotgun COULD return if we are talking about Season 4 double shotty. 

1. **How** **double shotty would affect our current meta.**

The way Fortnite has evolved during these last 2 seasons show that a Season 4, nerfed, double shotty would still be strong, but not the best and only thing to use anymore. We have new weapons like the AK, Silenced Scar, and even some of the SMG'S that are used by many people as Shotgun secondaries. The Meta would be balanced as there would be a variety of loadout choices based on playstyle, which is healthy for any BR game.

We would see loadouts like pump-tac, pump-heavy, heavy-tac, pump-AR, heavy-AR, tac-deagle and last but not least pump-smg and heavy-smg.

2 . **How this would affect the Double Barrel Shotgun.**

The Double Barrel Shotgun was supposed to be the replacement of the Double Shotgun, but it only got into this wierd, limbo state where it is considered good if you look at its stats, but in most situations you are rarely going to be THAT close to someone in a Build Battle to the point where the Barrel would be useful. I don't really know what would happen to it, but I do suggest it being reworked or vaulted.

3 . **How this would affect the skillgap of the game.**

Since the meta's of S4,S5 and 6 would be combined into one, super meta we could say, skilled players would still be able

to shred and dominate lower tier players simply because a OP weapon or meta doesn't make an OP player, plus the fact that you have to hit accurate, and timed shots for maximum effectivness with the shotguns (mostly after their nerfs) in some cases it would definetly still be, better to use an SMG as a secondary, so there would still be a skillgap between the players who can hit their shots and provide maximum damage with their shotguns, and the ones who just hold mouse one and eventually get the kill.

Keep in mind im always open to disscusion and suggestions, and we should keep this disscusion civilized.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **The current average player is way better than the average player from the past**. They know how to properly build, how to protect themselves correctly, etc. resulting in fights taking longer thus increasing third-partying and this has been eased up by the next point. All of that is normal and nothing can be done about it.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **Turbobuilding**. Simply the fact that you can hold left-click and make yourself untouchable causes fights to be longer. At this point, we cannot have it removed simply because this feature has been ingrained in the game now. It makes it easier for those who have trouble spamming the left-click (well, easier for anyone to be fair), a lot of build possibilities wouldn't be possible without it (or they would be EXTREMELY hard for the vast majority). Simply put, turbobuilding, if someone uses it (everyone does at this point), makes fight to last longer which is normal and nothing can be done about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, for 1 and 2, those things have been in the game for quite a long time now and it was manageable. Yes it makes fights a bit longer for sure but not over the top. But the 3rd point, on top of the 1st and 2nd, causes the current problems we have.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **The time to kill (TTK)** has been significantly increased throughout numbers of patch. 90% of the gun balances patch of the remaining guns have received nerfs (I am being a bit hyperbolic here). TTK is a big factor on determining how long a fight will last (longer a fight, more chances of being third-partied). Just to give an idea, if a fight where shotguns do 200 vs a fight where shotguns do 20, which fight will be take longer? Obviously the one where they do 20 by a LONG shot. Supposedly, [Epic wants pros to fight in late game circles (with 10-15 people and not 40-60 all building each other out into the storm)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9u3hyu/a_bit_of_info_from_an_epic_employee/). Well, increasing the TTK by making guns weaker and weaker, you are sure as hell not solving the issue, you are just worsening it. Anyway, What did Epic do specifically to make TTK to take so much longer than before? Let's take a look.

3.1. I will start with the SMGs. The current SMGs and compact SMGs have had their DPS decreased from (all in order, common to legendary) ***247, 260, 273, 253 and 264*** to ***204, 216, 228, 200 and 210***. **All of their DPS have been reduced by \~20%.** On top of that, they vaulted the suppressed SMG and drumgun. That is a lot.

Let's have an idea why they did that. [In patch 5.10, wood build got a big nerf](https://gyazo.com/7cce7152a7c58b3abc059edb8f3b581d). That nerf made it so SMGs could obliterate through structures leaving the person being sprayed at destroyed even through all of their builds protecting them. To fix this issue, [Epic did an update on 7/25 nerfing those 2 SMGs](https://gyazo.com/5e2be316826e46bac3964566cf463d70). **Those nerfs were needed**, however, a bit too much about this one: ***SMG and Compact SMG accuracy bonus reduced from 35% to 15%.*** **That nerf is completely useless and retarded** because it was aimed to make it the SMGs useless for long range (that is how it should be) but they implemented a huge nerf to it  already fixing this issue which is the following: ***SMG, Compact SMG, and Silenced SMG damage falloff range reduced from 2400/3500/5000 to 2000/3000/4000 and percentage reduced from 100/80/65% to 100/70/40%.*** That nerf was good enough and made the accuracy bonus nerf to be redundant resulting in having those guns to have big bloom even at close range. We all know bloom is something that does not involve skill but only RNG which is bad.

Let's go back in 'good old days' (end of season 4) where wood walls were not nerfed, double pump, drumgun and the tactical SMG were things (according to so many of this sub, tactical SMG was perfectly fine). **The tactical SMG had 234, 247 and 260 DPS with an extremely low spread/bloom** (the tactical SMG was BETTER than the oh mighty cancerous drumgun or P90 on its first day). Yes, the tactical SMG was considered OP for long range however it was not considered OP close range, it was comparable to double pump (even though it was better but no one was complaining about it, probably because of the amount of diversity in loadouts). No one was batting an eye on how ""cancerous"" the drumgun was, no one used it (the only reason why people thought it was OP at a certain point was simply because it was the best gun of its category after all the nerfs on other guns while it did not get any). Anyway, during the 'good old days' no one was complaining about anything except 1 thing. **No complaints on third partying, fights taking forever or SMGs being OP.** The only complaint was double shotguns even after its damage nerf and pullout delay increase which was a [big ???](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/018/489/nick-young-confused-face-300x256-nqlyaa.jpg) to me since pump&gt;SMG was better. They probably were complaining because they were having PTSD.

To summarize 3.1, SMGs with low DPS increases the TTK. SMGs with high DPS was not an issue until the wood wall nerf which completely pivoted how effective they became. They became drastically better to the point where they were OP.

3.2. Shotguns are extremely weak thus TTK taking longer. On the initial release, shotguns were in fact overpowered compared to everything else. A damage nerf was 100% necessary. Having the potential to one shot with 1 pump shot is ridiculous and prevents 2 people to at least have complex fair fight. Obviously, a TTK that is extremely short is as bad as extremely long, there needs to be a balance. Therefore, Epic implemented a [necessary nerf in 4.3 content update](https://gyazo.com/ed19c15cdb49bded5dd497bf75e79523). That nerf made the shotguns not as overpowered and more balanced. However, in patch 5.0, [they fucked the shotgun up big time with the introduction of spread pattern with no variation](https://gyazo.com/73f34720a8d6bd12b0d78feca291aea0). The idea behind it is great, a consistent, static spread pattern eliminates RNG and rewards good players but the pellets are so spread apart resulting in hits that are extremely weak and no big damage unless you are in their face.

*Processing img ngufjn36ocx11...*

This patch has dramatically weaken the shotguns without there being a huge backlash or anything about that specific change because the idea is great, a consistent, static spread pattern, what is there not to like about that? However, this resulted in people starting to complain that their shotguns shooting peanuts.

The shotguns got 2 big nerfs, combined together, making them really weak but if it were just one or the other nerf (not both) ,the shotguns would be balanced or fix the static spread pattern to be tighter. This would shorten up the TTK but not by too much but enough to help making fights shorter, reducing thirdpartying, less people in finals circle in competitive games, etc.

To summarize 3.2, shotguns are too weak mainly because of a change that were supposed to make them better/no RNG/more rewarding for having a precise aim, thus increasing the TTK.

&amp;#x200B;

What is funny about a gun that performs well is that people will start complaining and saying: ""OMG THIS GUN SO OP BECAUSE I GET KILLED SO QUICKLY, VAULT IT IT RUINS THE GAME!!!"", etc. and then Epic fixes it. Well, now, that being changed made it so fights now last for so long and those same people that were complaining about this or that gun being OP are complaining about thirdpartying.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are 2 solutions that I can think of, one is a bit more extreme (1) than the other (2).

&amp;#x200B;

1. Increasing the damage of SMGs and shotguns on players but tweak their structural damage to be weaker than their player damage. Or simply put, having guns damage to players not directly related to their structural damage. For instance, currently, an AR spamming a wall is balanced, but an SMG with increased DPS (like between the time of patch 5.10 and update on 7/25) is overpowered. If the SMGs DPS to player were the same as the time between patch 5.10 and update on 7/25 but their structural damage being the same as of right now (similarly to when the Tactical SMG was a thing and before wood wall nerf), that will help reducing the TTK without it being overpowered. Basically, that will result in the time where tactical SMGs was used. Walls were hard to break (before the wood walls nerf from 200 to 150) but when hitting on your opponent, it will hurt but they can still comfortably protect themselves. Also, supposedly, the Tactical SMG was fine back then, then it should be fine now too.

2. Bring back the accuracy bonus of the SMGs to 35% instead of 15%. Remove completely the delay when switching shotguns if the same spread patterns on them stays. If Epic really wants the delay to be kept (even though it does not make sense at all since they nerfed the shotgun to the ground already), then make the spread of shotguns smaller or increase the shotgun damage but obviously not both at the same time because it will be too good.",FortniteCompetitive

How do you think it should be tweaked?,"I was recently watching some youtube videos with gameplay back in season 3-4. And the most astonishing part was when the guys fort got hit by a rocket, and only one wall broke. This was sooo long ago, I forgot it even existed. Now Im wondering how would an a rocket launcher tweak work? Lets ignore the grenade launcher and quad launcher for simplicity.

I think that reverting would make the game feel better, and it wont be so tough to go against a RL. Right now, I think its too big of an advantage. Before, a RL was just a fun little thing to have. Not allthat good, but an interesting weapon. No weapon should be this good. I think that if a weapon is slightly annoying to play against, that is ok. You have to change your playstyle to win. But ths new rocket launcher is just a straight up advantage over the whole lobby and this isnt quite right.

First, we need to decide what role the RL should have. Should it be a build counter (which the game  needs, but thats a discussion for another day) or a tool purely for killing enemies. I think there are a variety of ways to go about this.

Lets say the RL should be offense based: it should have that trait of only destroying one wall so its bad at breaking down builds. However, it should reload faster and travel faster, but have less damage and a smaller radius. Perhaps like the stats of a individual quad launcher shot. This way it would be a good tool for damage, but if you know how to build, it should never be a real problem. 

If the RL was build counter: It can keep the currently destroying all builds in its radius (wait dont leave!). But, the rockets will travel much slower, be significantly louder, and do much less damagr.  Due to the amount of warning, i think it will be used less for actually knocking stuff down, but more for the pressure of having a rocket come at them. The player will act differently, and that pressure can be used against them. 

I now realized i just described two very different things. I think some sort of change is due though, the current rocket launcher does too much for one slot. It needs some sort of rework. Alternatively, the two explosives i just described can be added in as two different items.

TL;DR: Should explosives blow up all builds and be a build destroyer, or go back to only blowing up the line of sight and be a purely offense based weapon.",FortniteCompetitive

I am from India. This post isn't only about the SEA servers, but also some constructive feedback. First of all, thanks Epic for at least adding SEA servers. [/r/FortniteCompetitive](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive) doesn't make sense for us, 90% of things shown there aren't for us high ping players. This post is not only for Asian players, but same also applies to African players too. I am sure there would be some datacenter provider in that region.

Now here is the problem.

1. The SEA servers you added are not consistent, are affected by high ping every second day. I don't know why you selected GCP instead of AWS.
2. **It is hosted in Singapore (only)**. Now if you see the map (image), there is a Mumbai server too. I am not asking you to add the servers there because I live in India, it for the good sake. Mumbai server will help some Middle East countries too. I am not asking to remove Singapore servers, but there is a big community here in India (e.g FtnIndia)(also why have two side by side Asian servers (Seoul, Tokyo))
3. **You are losing players in this region.** Many of my friends don't play this game anymore. You said there are ""less"" players in this region. First of all, to grow your game in a region, you need to be a part of that region. New players won't be interested too much in playing this game because of the delays. I am an OG player (Season 1 start, maybe that's why I've waited and waited and never thought about leaving the game).
4. **We don't need sub-region, we need a dedicated region.** See this post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9rk6nn/its\_time\_subregion\_matchmaking\_needs\_to\_go/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9rk6nn/its_time_subregion_matchmaking_needs_to_go/)). I will give you a nice example: Suppose today you have a big mansion, and the next day, you are forced to live in a smaller house even if you have that big one. Would you like this? No!
5. **Very high chance of losing in build fights.** Most of the time, I will fall under my own ramps or the delay would make me mad. There is a very high chance I would kill that player if my latency is low.
6. **Where is the competitive scene?** We mostly see NA or EU players only in skirmish. Where is the competitive scene in India or any neighboring country? I bet there would be some very good player here if you would give us a nice server. (There are some local competitions but we want official ones)
7. **Seeing low-latency players.** For example, in the TSM house, the ping is 0-10ms. That's so low. Farming is quicker and no edge case in build fights. You just feel smooth and comfortable.
8. **Problems when playing with friends in different regions.** A few of my friends reside in US, we have two options, either play on EU or ASIA. I prefer ASIA because of low packet loss. But sometimes, SEA comes and then those friends would have around 300ms ping. Think about it.
9. The final, **PEOPLE LEAVE MATCHES TO GET A BETTER SERVER,** only yesterday, my friend would leave the current match a request to get a SEA server.

That's all for now. I am being optimistic right now to hear from you.

the result is that third partying is now the only play style where you can really feel confident that you'll do more damage than you take, even if it's less fun.

3) **Conflicting schedules.** *Jane loves Competitive Fortnite, she's even gone as far to switch from Xbox to PC. Unfortunately for Jane, (who's btw is a nurse working 9pm-6am, 6 days/week) she can't show off her skills because of the restricted time limit, not only that, but she misses out on valuable practice experience against potentially better players. Since most scrims happen at night, she's also unable to partake in those, leaving her stuck with very minimal ways to improve against the best.*

3) **Inaccurate Analytics and Statistics.** - Most players have taken these tournaments somewhat of a joke, mainly due to the reasons listed above, but also as well as a few others. Just the simple thought of people taking these tournaments as a *joke* should alarm Epic that something is wrong with the current Tournaments. 

**TL;DR With the recent report that the game is now at 8.3 million peak concurrent players, there's no longer a reason to force competitive players to play within a certain time limit. I suggest to Epic they open up the tournaments to allow more players to play by removing the time limit and restricting the amount of games played (a penalty for dying).**

It seems there is a near even split between players who enjoy the change and players who hate it.

While I’ve seen plenty of arguments on both sides of keeping/getting rid of glider deploy, I’d like to note the impact that this type of polarizing issue has on the community.

Those who report they hate the change are playing the game less or considering leaving entirely. The only others time we’ve seen such a high concentration of people considering stepping away from the game were when the p90 was first released in a broken state and when splodes were recently changed to do damage through builds (then quickly reverted).

There’s a real problem with issues this polarizing. This kind of change, even though it is liked by some, threatens to kill a decent portion of the player base, who hate the change. Both sides agree that the game was in a pretty good state prior to the change (other than the typical minor gripes). 

I don’t think changes that divide the community to this degree are healthy for the long term player population. Yes - adjustments need to be made and the meta needs to be dynamic for the game to stay interesting, but if you’re changing things at the expense of ~50% of your player base, your player base is going to dwindle in the long run.

I think also everyone could start with a knife when they drop off the bus and it just sits in your 1 slot. 

Perhaps is could work something like:

Only about a 6inch blade or so, so you need to be close and fairly accurate. 

If you stab or slice a player from the front or side it could be 15 damage and if you stab/slice in the back could be 30 damage maybe also the head.

I think the functionality could work like this:

if you tap fire button once you stab, (super close range)

double tap to slice, (bit of a further range than a stab)

and  you could maybe tap once then double tap for like a stab and 2x slice combo move. 

Last functionality would be an assassination move which would be a hold function. Not sure on the hold timing but I’m thinking somewhere between .5-1sec hold timer and you have to be facing players back, if player turns away or moves out of your Aimer they can avoid assassination, but if you move with him and hold you can get the assassination off, and basically you both lose control of your players and you go into an assassination animation which could be like 1-2 secs long leaving both of you vulnerable in this small window. The assassinating player then slices the neck of the assassinated and does 100 dmg to that player.  

Not sure but it could be an interesting idea! What do you think? Too violent for fortnite? ",FortniteCompetitive

Our community is literally fine without ghost so if epic stopped inviting them to tournaments until they stopped being toxic then everything would be so much happier like look at Tfue or Nate or liquid they're never toxic.

The previous understanding of third parties was typically that the aggressor would usually have some distance to cover before they could reach you up close; this distance facilitated your ability to finish a fight and get a heal off.  Above average players like myself and most people on this sub would get acclimated to the very linear progression of most games:  early game aggression, followed by rotating as quickly as possible between individual fights in mid-game, to late game strategy.  

&amp;#x200B;

This progression is no longer the case.  A game of fortnite, now, does not seem to follow a linear trend; instead, the meta and SIGNIFICANT updates that have changed the understanding of the game have cultivated a wildly volatile and burst-focused meta.  Instead of a game that follows a logical progression, you have your normal early game, often times a much slower mid-game, and then upon your first engagement in the second or third circle, you're fighting wave after wave of opponents, who can fly in as a third party without any consequence whatsoever.  

&amp;#x200B;

I have thought about a lot of ways to deal with these changes, and I'll try and list my thoughts.  

* Expect the unexpected:  people can do things now that they couldn't previously do (and probably shouldn't be able to do)
   * if you're sniped from someone on a mountain 150m away, they no longer need any mobility item to immediately rush you.  if you're healing in a 1b1 or a 2b1, someone can fire a rocket at you from 200m away and land on you by the time it's hitting.  You have to learn to predict these scenarios, and respond accordingly.  sometimes this means you may have to sacrifice a heal to become an aggressor and sway the fight in your favor 
* Do NOT become kill thirsty
   * if you're winning a fight, and your opponent decides to turtle, and a third party begins to engage on you (they will focus on you due to your clear advantage in the encounter), DO NOT continue to apply pressure on the turtler.  You have to at LEAST put shots on the third party, if not fully engage with them.  One benefit of this update is the clear advantage of high ground, which simultaneously allows you to manage two or more aggressors simultaneously 
* STAY MOBILE 
   * the same concept is applicable to solo squads; if you are constantly moving, changing positions, and switching up your angles, it will be much harder for a third party to swanton you and overtake you.  playing a stagnant position in highground is asking to be lazered by a third party.  
* keep track of time
   * According to how long (and where on the map) your fight is enduring, you have to be aware of what playstyle is necessary at the moment.  if you have just engaged in a fight, you have the opportunity to build and shoot in a conservative and effective way (tfue special, shots inbetween builds, etc.).  If your fight is drawing on longer, it may be time to put yourself in riskier situations to speed up the outcome.  It is not the ideal situation, but it prevents the efficacy of a third party 
* Practice DEFENSIVE mechanics
   * The current meta is unprecedented in that aggressive players will be playing more defense than ever before.  Hence, having mastered defensive mechanics is absolutely critical.  some notable strats to practice are:
      * maximum speed in editing and building out of any direction of a turtle 
      * taking shotgun shots while someone is spraying your wall, and immediately replacing that wall 
      * defensive edits for quick shotgun peeks 
      * snaking and 1b1 maneuvering 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry this post was so long, I just noticed a lot of frustration on this sub and with my teammates/other friends.  Hopefully, this post helps your mentality and strategies in dealing with the frustrating aspects of this new meta.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR:  Third partying is more prevalent than ever.  Be prepared for previously impossible pushes, DO NOT tunnel vision, stay mobile and unpredictable at all times, keep track of time/position, and practice defensive mechanics.  ",FortniteCompetitive

There’s multiple posts a day about glider redeploy saying the same thing. Players disengaging are pussy and third parties have increased by 800%. 

You don’t have to take every fight, but if you do make sure you have enough mats/heals for the fight after. Make sure you’re not in a location where someone can position themselves on natural high-ground and third party away. 

If someone joins the fight, let the other two duke it out if you can’t fight both, and then take your shot or disengage.

If the fight is in the center of the map, there needs to be a timer in your head that lets you know the fight can’t go on for more than a certain period of time before the scavengers start looking for scraps. 


If someone tries to swanton bomb your ass, block them out and pray they don’t have a grappler. 

If your enemy disengages, shoot them out of the air. They’re obviously a weaker player or low on health, so, chase them. Orrrr maybe now might be the time to reevaluate your position like the smart player you are. Because now you’re sooo low on mats after your fight, right? Ohh no, maybe you shouldn’t have spent 1k mats on a build fight (EVEN THOUGH WE ONLY HAVE BUILD FIGHTS NOW BECAUSE OF GLIDER REDEPLOY). Welp, time to farm up then and maybe ask Epic to increase the farm rate. 

Epic said they were keeping glider redeploy and would make adjustments. Majority of the pros and this sub enjoy it. We get your frustrated that you can’t adapt but mods please can we get rid of these posts that don’t offer anything different?

With that said, I am planning on experimenting with switching my forward bind to shift since I can constantly press it and will never have to take my finger off it to hit another bind.

The advantages of this are;

1) w as a primary build bind, in between q and e. I personally have q as walls and e as stairs, so possibly binding floor to w would make for easier build combos.

2) Since you can now move without needing to hold w, you can use your middle finger to press many of the number keys and (possibly) the functional keys.

3) This frees up your previous floor bind for something such as edit, etc...


Itll certainly take some getting used to, but in the long run id imagine it to be wildly beneficial.

I am actually wanting to improve and I keep hoping there will be a skill based match making playlist in the future as pub stomping is not satisfying anymore. 

Currently I have been playing scrims and my win rate is low which I would be ok with if it was actually because I was a worse player, but it’s not. It’s because I don’t use XIM. The best XIM player beat any top tier computer player due to inherent use of auto-aim combined with kbm and mouse. It’s the best of both worlds. You get the ultra fast switches and building combined with auto aim. Some of these kids in scrim lobbies make Myth or Kayuun look like toddlers with their building and robot aim.

Now before I get roasted and people say “being on kbm on console puts you in PC lobbies”... sadly it doesn’t with XIM because it mimics a controller. 

The scrim discord openly embraces XIM because it truly does give you the edge on your opponent. Around 80% of players use it in the discord.

Why am I bringing this here? because I know it doesn’t affect most people and they chalk up a loss as a loss, but when you die to a player that embarrasses you... watch them.. XIM is more prevalent than you think.

I also dislike how Epic lied to us, saying it was a one week test and then actually bringing it into the game.

###Why Blitz would be better mode for competitive matches

Viewing experience in tournaments would be way better. Less farming, more fighting, less loot RNG and shorter matches.

In Blitz mode chests have 80-90% spawn rate, wich in my opinion should be changed to 100% recuding even more RNG, especially in early game. In regular matches chest only spawn 50-60% of the times so landing on chest spawn is usually not worth it. Also in Blitz, finding empty floor loot spawn change is only 3.55%, recuding even more rng. Ammo boxes spawn rates are higher on Blitz Mode. There is also more Supply Drops, would be interesting to see people fight for them.

You get double the mats in Blitz, one might argue this is too much, but remember that the time to farm is way lower too since zones are moving quicker and there is more fighting.

The starting zone spawns pretty much in the middle every game, but i think it should be possible for the zone to spawn more off center too (without covering much water though). This would result variety in drop spots and nobody would ""own"" a spot since it might not be on the circle. There wouldn't be ""Tfue and Cloak only won because of West World"" arguments anymore. Since the Zone at beginning is way smaller than in regular matches, there would be more contesting and interesting early game fights without nearly as much RNG due to upped chest and floor loot + 50% more mats. 

This with balanced point system (something like at TwitchCon) would be way more pleasing to watch. I also think Glider Re-Deploy shouldn't be thing especially in Blitz pro matches, since fights take longer than in pubs and third partying would be hell making people just turtle up even more than usual.

Here's why,"So with my accomplished research team and 2 years of independent research myself, I have come to the following conclusions that support why Cloakzy may not be as good as everyone says:

1. His stats are sub-par for pro level. A 4.36 KD is much, much lower than that of other pros. Ninja has a close to 11 KD and hell, the absolute bot Daequan has a \~7 KD. No player should be ""pro"" until their KD is higher than 6. Period.
2. His 90s are sub-par compared to other pros. With the 90 degree turn meta in the scene, I see Cloak struggling to 90 as fast as Mongraal, Mitr0, and Martoz. In his 90s, you can still see him placing each piece, wall by wall. A fast 90 degree turn should be no more than a blur and quite literally, flashy. Say what you want about sTratEGY and aIm, but proficiency in 90 degree turns are so so so so so important in the current state of the game.
3. His res. Perhaps the largest bottleneck to his skill at the moment is his in-game resolution. 1920x1080? seriously? native in season 6?? who even wants to watch that resolution right guys? He's seriously missing out on that sweet sweet vertical FOV which is killing his improvement.

One of the main ones is my gun shooting on its own after I place a trap. This has gotten me killed a lot of times as I’ll pull out my gun and it will destroy my builds automatically, earlier I pulled out my RPG and it automatically shot and killed me. On top of that the glider doesn’t redeploy for me even when I spam the X button, sad how they can add a feature and it doesn’t even work smh. Also I’m still getting blank hitmarkers, a problem I’ve seen since season 3/4 and it’s crazy that they still haven’t fixed it. Also sometimes my gun doesn’t shoot when I pull it out and I stand their awkwardly with my gun out and my crosshair on the enemy without any shots shooting. It’s so frustrating and it literally handicaps me as a player and I don’t want to play this game.

Furthermore I feel like my ps4 can’t handle the game I keep lagging and my game keeps stuttering, probably because of all the people gliding and the explosives going off every second...

Glider redeploy is not the answer to turtling. It only creates more 3rd parties and more damage done to unsuspecting players which, if not killed, will then turtle because they're so low. Yes, you can run away with glider redeploy but if someone is so aggressive towards you the answer is not to glide away if you're one shot, it's to turtle. Most people I challenge don't even run away because I'm so aggro trying to get into their 1by1 and because turtling can buy you so much time, in the time i might actually get a wall from your turbo build someone would already glide up to me and I just end up dying or take a lot of damage done by the 3rd party.

Main advantages
- More materials (60 from chests)
- Fast storms
- More concentrated players due to smaller map

I feel like blitz might a bit too fast paced for it to be a regular mode, and the perfect game would be somewhere inbetween blitz and regular game mode imo.

The increased mats from chests is significant. Early game fights are less rng related due to being able to build more, and even people who dont farm usually drop at least a couple hundred mats.

I like high paced gameplay, and playing blitz is just way more intense when it comes to fights. Also playing blitz again reminds me of older seasons where building was prominent.

I've been playing a lot of Duos in the past few days and my experience has been absolutely awful and it's all because of glider redeploy. Every god damn fight late game you have 3-4 teams gliding in once you are done fighting. There is no room to breathe anymore. You literally get third partied to death and there is nothing you can do about it. 

I can't believe that people defend this mechanic. People talk about how it ""allows for a more aggressive play style now"" but this is bullshit. ""More aggressive"" literally translates to ""I can third party more now"". Because nobody is playing more aggressive. That player that just got 10 kills? He got those kills because he third partied ten people. When people talk about how there is more action now they really talk about flying from fight to fight to pick off low health enemies.

And what's with the bullshit tactics now? I get to the late game and see that there are 29 people still alive but I don't see half of them anywhere. People now camp the outskirts of the zone or hide somewhere doing nothing. They just wait for the zone to start moving so they can glide in and prey to be the last one arriving because you have a massive advantage now since everyone else got third partied to death.

Then there are the people literally camping in trees now, waiting for some fight to get over so they can come in like hyenas and pick off their worn down enemies. I never liked getting my build battle show down by some bush camper in the past but now getting mowed down by some no skin sitting in a tree feels ten times worse.

Sure there are a few more build battles now but at what cost? They now go mile high into the sky again, wasting all your mats. Your opponent now might just disengage leaving you with all your ammo and mats wasted and no reward. Then a third party instantly comes in and finishes you off and even if you still have the mats to fend them off, another party comes after and then you are dead. I have lost count of the times I reached endgame with 100 mats in the past week. It's absolutely ridiculous. People are already crying for mat buffs because it's becoming such an issue.

But do we really want to start changing the entire game just to make this broken mechanic work? The game was fine before, sure there was a lot of turtling but you could usually deal with that. Now it feels like so much skill and strategy lost and all for what? So we have more mobility? We already had a ton of mobility before.

I feel like this mechanic only exist to give trash players a better chance at getting kills. Third partying someone was always the easiest way to get a cheap kill. Now everyone does it at all times and the game is so much worse for it. Also you don't need to worry about positioning or fall damage anymore. The game feels like a dumbed down clusterfuck now.

Do people even enjoy winning now? I feel so bad every time I come in late and drop on some guy. How is it fun to win a game when you know your enemy has pretty much no chance in taking you on.

Lastly I want to talk about snipers. They are incredibly powerful now. You down someone and glide in and you can drop on them before they have the chance to even revive their team mate. This is exactly why it sucks so much that positioning is meaningless now. In the past if you had fought for a good spot on a mountain or so you at least had a chance to revive and heal before you got attacked after a knock. You earned that tiny bit of time by fighting for a good position.

I really hope they rethink and take it out of the game again or at least make it a LTM like in the past.",FortniteCompetitive

Some reasons I think it should come back

1.	Taking up 2 inventory slots for shotguns limits your space for other items like meds, mobility, or splodes.

2.	Fight rarely come down to a full on build battle these days, and if they do, the winner is usually who found the double barrel or RPG first. (If it’s two players of similar skill.)

3.	In my opinion it was one of the most fun mechanics ever, and bringing it back may help create some new interest in people who are unhappy with the state of the game

Don’t get me wrong, double pump would still be very very good, but it definitely wouldn’t be op like it used to. At least we could have a chance against someone with good RNG

You can go back to a few days ago and even watch Tom/Poach/Vivid/Chap's streams. It's easy to see that there is some tension between 72hrs (Tom) and Poach. A few days later 72hrs/Chap really didn't have the best chemistry going on. They've been one of the best duos, but after a #13th place at Twitcon, and 72hrs inability to pick up Chap, they've seemed to struggle in scrims.  

&amp;#x200B;

To top thing off in the skirmishes on 11/5/2018 72hrs killed Poach, and even accused him of rushing him. There were also many remarks by 72hrs about problems with Poach. A few games after that, 72hrs goes to a ""No No Area"" as it was stated by his teammate (Chap), because Vivid and Poach were there (Tomato Temple).72hrs claims the team he is rushing are ""bots"" and enters a 2v1 Fight with chap far away. Poach/Vivid 2v1 72Hours and kill him easily. Chaps proceeds to get mad while 72hrs replays. Poach also watched the clip of Tom calling them bots. Yesterday during the stream scrims on 11/6/2018 72hrs + Chap get off to a terrible start. They don't really get along the WHOLE stream and even openly argue and fight. When things are at the most heated between Chap + 72hrs, Poach decides to sit out for a game a watch 72hrs' stream live on his stream. You can watch this portion here... 

&amp;#x200B;

 https://www.twitch.tv/videos/332541848?t=04h27m43s 

&amp;#x200B;

Throughout the stream, 72hrs chat is telling him what Poach is saying, further pissing him off. Chap and 72hrs scrim a few more gave after this, fight the whole time and perform like absolute dog-shit on bad lobbies. Towards the end of the stream Chap says he has to go because he is getting tired. 72hrs gets off immediately, but the Chap decides to run scrims with another guy who was pretty terrible. They didn't do well. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's fairly clear to see the team ganging up against 72hrs and it would be difficult to see Chap + 72hrs duoing much longer after this. No just because of the infighting, but because they're doing terrible. An interesting sidenote is that Cloakzy was coming into 72hrs chat a lot. It seemed to piss of Chap and was even remarked upon by Poach. Poach clearly wasn't feeling Cloak for some reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else been following this event? People who watched Poach/Chap/or 72hrs recently might be aware of certain aspects. I guess there could be a lot going on here. It could also be 100% fake publicity garbage, I never rule that out when dealing with Twitch celebs. Also, if anyone has any clips, I'd love to add them to the post.

###Why Blitz would be better mode for competitive matches

Viewing experience in tournaments would be way better. Less farming, more fighting, less loot RNG and shorter matches.

In Blitz mode chests have 80-90% spawn rate, wich in my opinion should be changed to 100% recuding even more RNG, especially in early game. In regular matches chest only spawn 50-60% of the times so landing on chest spawn is usually not worth it. Also in Blitz, finding empty floor loot spawn change is only 3.55%, recuding even more rng. Ammo boxes spawn rates are higher on Blitz Mode. There is also more Supply Drops, would be interesting to see people fight for them.

You get double the mats in Blitz, one might argue this is too much, but remember that the time to farm is way lower too since zones are moving quicker and there is more fighting.

The starting zone spawns pretty much in the middle every game, but i think it should be possible for the zone to spawn more off center too (without covering much water though). This would result variety in drop spots and nobody would ""own"" a spot since it might not be on the circle. Since the Zone at beginning is way smaller than in regular matches, there would be more contesting and interesting early game fights without nearly as much RNG due to upped chest and floor loot + 50% more mats. 

This with balanced point system (something like at TwitchCon) would be way more pleasing to watch. I also think Glider Re-Deploy shouldn't be thing especially in Blitz pro matches, since fights take longer than in pubs and third partying would be hell making people just turtle up even more than usual.

What do you think? (^sorry for my bad english)

What is your mindset during a game and you die to a player who you know isn't as good as you, but they somehow manage to kill you?

I feel like some people don't understand what pro matches are for. It's to see who is the best at the game. The game that everyone else plays. The only way that fortnite would change pro games to be different than the regular solo/duo/squads would be if they added a ""comp/ranked"" mode. they use the pro events to advertise their game as well. So unless they add a ranked mode that everyone can play. Pro matches won't be different from the main game. ",FortniteCompetitive

Hopefuly Epic will take action to save their game before.  


\&gt; Double Shotgun Nerf  
\&gt; SMG Buff  
\&gt; Material Nerf  


The combination of these 3 changes significantly contributed to the decrease in the skill gap between players for obvious reasons. You can now shoot your opponents down or through walls by spamming your SMG without having to build too much, making it especially hard to deal with when you are being outnumbered in duos or squads. Building no longer protects you against a decent duo or squad, because they can just spam you down and you will burn through all your materials (which were nerfed not only in quantity obtained, but also in the HP they have.  
No big deal though, the players managed to adapt to this meta change and moved on, even though the building component of the game was nerfed a bit here.   
Next:  
\&gt; Addition of Grappler

&amp;#x200B;

Grappler is an uncompetitive item that allows players to almost completely ignore the building component of the game. Opponent is forced to use materials to defend against it while the player using it can waste none and will allow them to jump on opponent's face with a shotgun. The item is also incredibly powerful in competitive play (like Skirmish games) since it allows the players who obtained it to skip most of the stress in rotations, getting into the safe zone first than everyone else and almost too quickly to take significant damage. Loot RNG shouldn't have such a high impact in a game. Again, building component of the game being nerfed.

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt; Addition of Rift-To-Go  
\&gt; Glider Redeploy Mechanic  


As if the battle royale didn't have enough RNG already, Epic decided to add an item and a mechanic that allow for consecutive 3rd partying to take place. Playing for kills is now a really frustrating task, because you might waste all your materials fighting someone, weaken them, and then they run away and you get nothing from that fight. If you decide to chase them, they will land first and will have the ability to either shoot of build first again, so no matter the situation it is always lose-lose. In alternative, you might be able to fight that opponent, and finish the fight, but if anyone notices you,they will be next to you within seconds, giving you no time to heal or loot in most cases. 

Glider redeploying also allows players to build recklessly, with no fear of fall damage, which means there are now no downsides to being in the high ground. You not only dont have to waste mats reinforcing your structure, you also dont need to fear being knocked down. It's only pros and no cons, which shouldn't be the case with anything in this game, since that's what makes things unbalanced.  
Putting it short, glider redeploy has way more negatives than positives, it allows smoother rotations and faster engagements (and the 2nd part isnt even necessarely positive) but it also allows for people to be in advantageous positions way too much with little effort. And guess what, again, building component of the game being neglected.  


I could mention the Jetpack, Zombies and RPG Buff changes they made, but i wont since those were reverted (and thank god). But you get my point. Epic needs to stop adding stuff in the game that increases the RNG and decreases the skill gap between players. Stop neglecting the building component of the game, that's what makes Fortnite unique.  


Additional opinions: Epic needs to address bugs faster than they do (like people landing from a glide in a laid down position and shooting you immediately), and most importantly, please make editing smoother. Edit delay is one of the most annoying things to deal with in the current state of the game. Top priorities before even thinking of adding new stuff to the game.

Below are a list of things that will need to be rectified before any kind of meaningful events are held. I'm specifically addressing the duo tourney from a ps4 perspective but i imagine the problems are universal across platforms. 

Let me know if you have also encountered these issues as well or any others i may have missed.

False starts - if you don't restart your client after the prescribed start time, you can't get into a game. At all. 

Half filled lobbies - the first game you get in to will inevitably have only 60 people or less. Presumably because everyone else is still restarting their client.

Matchmaking errors - about 10 seconds after both players have readied up, both players will inexplicably become unreadied. No error message will pop up. There will be roughly a 30 second delay on the host being able to ready up again.

Matchmaking errors 2 - every third or fourth game there will be an actual error with a message.

Player left in the lobby - on rare occasions after both players have readied, only one will make it into the actual game, while the other is left in the lobby.

Points discrepancies - the automated score counter can be inaccurate. One example from our first game today when my partner and i placed 5th with 6 kills. This should be 3 points, 1 for placement and 2 for kills. Once back in the lobby, my screen showed us on 2 points (1 for placement and 1 for kills) and my partners showed 3. After our next game where we died off spawn, both our screens showed 2 points. Both said the 2 points were for kills and 0 for placement. So not only did it initially show different point values, somehow an earned point was removed from our total.

Tournament timing - the rigid timing of the events makes it extremely difficult for anyone who works in the afternoons or evenings. In some regions it starts as early as 4pm, and here in Australia we lose one of the limited opportunies to compete because the weekly downtime falls exactly halfway through the scheduled timeslot.

no kind of kill multipliers or points or money for kills that will be enough to make the pros fight early game, except for Aydan and Nick but they do it anyway.

It’s far easier and safer to get kills late game in competitive play whilst players are rotating and low on mats and shield. 

The only way of getting the pros to fight early is to make it so that an aggressive early game will reward players with a massive advantage over a team that have sat in a box all game. 

For example, shields and mats for kills, no loot above rare rarity outside of main Towns, dogtags for kills that you can redeem for guns at vending machines, extra health bar “adrenaline” that gains value after getting kills. Then on maybe the 3rd/4th circle you get rid of these benefits. 

I personally think that no guns better than blue/rare outside of towns combined with mats and shield for kills until 4th circle would work well. 

I still don’t think at the moment pros would risk fighting early game to upgrade from a blue AR to gold scar though, so maybe the damage gap needs to be larger but anything like that needs to be tested properly. 

Please let me know what you think. ",FortniteCompetitive

And here's why. Unlike any gun or item that's been added (c4, drum gun, LMG , etc) the deploy feature is available to everyone. It's changing the the game drastically with it's existence in Fortnite. And what I mean by this is, It was bearable week 1. But people are starting to find strategies, and ways to abuse it. It's the most aggravating thing when you out build someone and they  prolong the fight by flying away. ""jusT cHaSe tHeM"" doesn't cut it sometimes , especially when you used the last of your materials to obtain high ground. Resetting fight's shouldn't be normal at all. Especially with the lack of loot in Fortnite. Early game solo squads is just impossible now along with dropping high kill games. I've tried to readjust the way I play early game in solo squads but it's just not enough. Picking squads off 1 by 1 early game isn't effective anymore. They just fly on you and destroy you. The game shouldn't be based around solo squads, but this is applicable to solos as well. People having the option to disengage and reset fights early game is so crucial. I'm an experienced player and I just can't drop high kill games anymore. There was nothing wrong with bouncers, and nobody complained about not having bouncers. If you were unaware of your traps and you die to fall damage because you're building too high DESERVE to die from fall damage. It's also awful for competitive. We all know epic are trying to reduce the amount of people end game to prevent heal offs. But this doesn't do it justice, if anything it exacerbates it. High ground will always be superior with absolutely NO consequences. I usually readjust to every update and meta change every single week. But this is just unfair and ridiculous. Changing fundamental mobility mechanics of the game is something you just don't touch. All of my friends quit, and I'm sure a lot of other people quit. YOUR reasoning for removing bouncers was because there was too much mobility in the game. Ironic.

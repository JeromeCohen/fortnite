I am really enjoying how Dire and that recent Fish Dude has introduced less-human, more unique character silhouettes to the game. I think a mutant alligator would fit in nicely with the monsters introduced last season, as well as the aquatic stuff that's being hinted at for next month.

I've included little details like a sharks tooth necklace, indicating he's been in some big fights with other animals, as well as a golden hook through his shoulder from all the people who've tried to hunt him in the past.

It seems like having a smg or deagle to easily break walls would be smarter than having two pumps. 

Also, x2 pump was most prominent when players didn’t build as much, and would shotgun battle without building.

I know that this is a BR at heart, therefore RNG will always be a factor and straying away from that means straying away from the core concept for this game.BUT, when you have time limited events like the pop up cups, I think a lot of us would appreciate the useless/cheesy items being removed. 

To start, the six shooter should be removed. It is really the only weapon, besides snipers, that gives you very little chance of winning a gun fight vs literally any other weapon in the game. Second, the boom box and boogie bombs (maybe) should be removed. Boom box in general is just annoying, and puts you in very unfair situations with virtually zero counters to it. The boogie bomb is up for debate because it’s not totally OP but at the same time, it requires no skill to use and has a very strong benefit. Lastly, the grey tac just seem totally outclassed. In normal Fortnite, it’s a decent weapon because you aren’t going to be facing good players all the time. But in the tournaments, all the other shotguns (pump, heavy, and SPAS) heavily outclass it, leaving anyone who gets stuck with it, very disadvantaged.

The last change I’d like to see is removing scoped AR and Thermal rifles from chests. Now I don’t think these weapons are useless so that’s why I don’t want them completely removed but chests are the only sure fire way to get look when dropping at your location. It would be nice to always have a viable weapon spawn in chests so you know you have a shot if someone else lands nearby. 

I know I sound like I’m complaining too much but some small changes like this would make these events much more skill based and less casual-esque. Let me know what you guys think!",FortNiteBR

My suggestion to Epic would be making it so that every time a skin is in the shop, you can refund it. However, the catch is that if you log on to the game the time that skin is in the shop, you can’t refund it the next time it is. 

For example, you bought Ravage yesterday, and you realise that you don’t like it. It comes out again the next month and you come online. You get a one off change to refund that item (for the entirety of your session that you are online) but once you log off, you don’t get the option anymore. 

This could be beneficial to epic in the sense that  they can release more skins instead of juggling the same ones over and over again.

One downside is that the OG’s who are always going to be angry whenever their skins come out, are going to be (surprise surprise) angry. ",FortNiteBR

Think about it ; your bud gets downed and 10 people are rushing your location. You smoke it off , everyone stops their push and you pick your teammate up in the middle of nowhere , the other 10 fight while you guys chill in the smoke and then walk away after healing up.

The shards in loot lake slowly start to crumble, and each piece that falls, causes a crack in the sky. Once all pieces have fallen, a live event will occur. We will be sent back to the live cube event, The cube will spin as it did, but something will change. The cube will slow down, and as the cube starts slowing down, the world of fortnite slowly goes back in time. The map and everything, all live events, goes back in time Extremely fast. Everything will fly past us, all the memories, all to the start of the meteor. The meteor will be 1 inch to hitting dusty, and a small ""Ding"" will sound. The meteor will slowly start deteriorating, and the game will go forward back to the present day, and everything will seem as normal. But the pieces that crumbled off of the shards of the cube, will be consumable, and will be called ""Spectriolite"". You consume it, and it will take you to the spectral zone. The spectral zone is the middle of time itself. You will be able to shoot people while in the spectral zone. You will be in the spectral zone for 15 seconds, and then you will be teleported back to the island through a rift in the sky. As the season passes, the map will slowly be comsumed by the spectrial essence.

What it does for the 15 seconds is it protects you from all incoming damage. This means that nothing can do any damage to you for 15 seconds. Also, during this 15 seconds, your character should have a red glow to keep people from reporting you for cheating.](https://i.redd.it/17zgywgt0p821.jpg)

Things I wouldn't mind staying in the game

vehicles that (can) stay
- golf cart
- shopping cart or replace with dirt bike
- quad crasher

Mobility items that (can) stay
- rift to go
- shock wave grenades(both kinds)
- bounce pads

Weapons to remove, more personal opinion as well as others
- six shooter (sucks as a starting weapon)
- silenced assault rifle (I'd rather more scar drops)
- quad launcher (grenade launcher and rocket spam is bad enough)

I might have missed something but some that you might think I missed didn't make it for a reason

This is my opinion, be civil, discuss! I'm not here to argue or be called trash. Ok. I love this damn game and I wanna enjoy it more again.

294,Shaytokun,1546706992,acvqvk,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/acvqvk/re_double_helix_bundle_code_wording_in_response/,1,Re: Double Helix Bundle Code Wording in response to Eon Code Wording,"Hopefully Epic Games Sees and Responds to this as I figured that this should be brought up as a response to the Eon Bundle Situation. I am in no way trying to say that anyone is entitled to anything, however I am bringing up that the same mistake has been made with more severity than the Eon Bundle.

&amp;#x200B;

So while I was recently looking to obtain the Double Helix Bundle Code, I had heard about the Eon Bundle Confusion regarding getting Save the World with the bundle. I then proceeded to reread images of the Double Helix Bundle Code that people had posted online as I had noticed and discovered that there is also a lack of context.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I personally know that Nintendo Switch doesn't have Save the World on it, but the code does indeed state the same as the Eon Bundle Code.

&amp;#x200B;

Full Game Download

Lack of Context as to whether it comes or doesn't come with Save the World

And even a Full Game Download Code.

&amp;#x200B;

While I personally own Save the World (even though I can't play it at the moment as I don't own a PC, Playstation 4, or Xbox 1), but do not own the Double Helix Skin Set, there were probably a lot of confused parents or even gamers in general that used the full game download code only to find out they got a code for a game that's already free with the other half of the game missing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heck, a lot of players have been confused when Epic hasn't come out with a response as to why Save the World isn't coming to switch as no official answer has come out.

&amp;#x200B;

The images are not mine, but images I found to show that there is no context as to whether or not Save the World is included as well as showing that it does say full game download.

Clans and scrim hosts dont allow us to join/play without having us 1v1 them or place top on the turtle fight leaderboard. 

HOW IT COULD FUNCTION
-It could function like the refund system. Only 3 stat resets
-You could possibly have 1 stat reset per season.
-Option to wipe specific seasons. This will essentially function as an already used stat reset in older seasons. Basically wipe the seasons you were bad/messing around in. 

ALTERNATE SOLUTION TO STAT PROBLEM
-Allow the viewing of separate season stats in the game. So we dont have to go to sites that look up our stats.

I mean sure, you do take some damage when your plane gets blown up if you haven't bailed already but as Upshall said which I agree with, thats not a really good counter.

If you're playing solo, or duos for that matter,  you can waste half of your medium ammo and try to shoot it down. If the pilot bail before you shoot it down you basically wasted that ammo while accomplishing nothing.  
If your playing squads, you can shoot it down fairly easy. But it still eats through your ammo supply. Especially early game, when you have like two mag's each. And now you have a full squad reigning down on you like seal team six.  
And you can of course put down a turret, which takes down planes fairly easy, but then you're a sitting duck risking being  sniped by some bush wookie 370m away.

Anyway, my suggestion/idea/whatever, to make it just a bit easier to counter planes, is that when firing with a handheld weapon towards a plane the bullets penetrate the hull of the plane.   
For instance when you have a plane straight up from you and you start firing and hit the plane below the pilots seat, the bullets penetrate the hull and damages the pilot. This would of course require quite a bit of damage drop off. On top of my head maybe 5-10% damage of what the damage would be compared to if you hit the pilot with a direct hit.

I think this would make pilots think twice before going full kamikaze on players on the ground and it would give players not in a plane a fighting chance against kamikaze pilots.

This post became a lot longer than I thought at first so sorry about the wall of text. And just for the record, I have been up for more than 24h grinding scrims so this might be the worst idea ever. I just wanted to share. Hope everything makes sense at least.",FortNiteBR

Want a true semi-automatic rifle that can compete with the Heavy AR? Or are you just tired of that stupid AK, like I am?

Introducing the Battle Rifle! Semi-automatic, accurate and with a slightly lower zoom of a Hunting Rifle.

Honestly, I hate the AK. I don't know why I have to fire the damn thing like a Desert Eagle to even hit anyone. I would rather carry a blue AR over a gold AK, and don't get me started on the Scoped AR.

I feel like the only good long range rifle is the Thermal Scope, but even then it has its own set of issues.

So, here's my idea...add true semi-automatics.

**Uncommon-Rare:** the model will be based on the [FN FAL](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/FN-FAL_belgian.jpeg), one of the worlds first Assault Rifle designs after WW2. 

Mag size will be a nice 25, like the AK.

Damage wise, I think 28 for Uncommon and 30 for Rare is a good solid number. Nothing too crazy.

**Epic-Legendary:** the [M14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/PEO_M14_EBR.jpg) will be a great model choice. America's choice for their AR in the 50s, choosing it over the FN FAL.

Mag size should be 30, taking a pattern trend with the SMGs (still annoyed at the P90 clip nerf but meh) 

Damage should actually match the purple and gold AK, maybe one or two points higher or lower. 

The rate of fire should be the same as the scoped AR, a little bit higher for the FAL and a little slower for the M14.

That's all, it's a rough idea right now.",FortNiteBR

To do this trick, the player on the outside of the turtle builds alongside it and builds a wall and floor on top of the turtle.
Then they place a turret on top of that floor.
For some reason, that turret prevents the turtling player from replacing their pyramid so the person outside gets an immediate chance at getting a kill from the high ground.

okey, everyone hates planes, they dont hate that you can go around in them, they hate thats you can go through everything with no problem, epic made a change where if a plane explodes it takes 50hp of the people that are on the plane, but thats not enough.

The perfect way is to make materials do more damage to planes, if soemone hits a mountain or the floor it instantly explodes, if someone hits its with metal same.

With brick it should take maybe 2 walls of brick to make a plane explode.

And with wood, maybe 4 hits to explode.

And change the damage people take when it explodes to 75.

People may think this is dumb but it isnt, if you damage the plane badly and he rams into your building he is %100 going to explode and take alot of damage.

This is the best way to nerf the planes.",FortNiteBR

Now, this isn’t strictly a bad thing or a recent thing either, but it’s the underlying reason why the game feels like it’s become so sweaty. 

People that aren’t as good at the game used to play alongside everyone else in solos, duos and squads. There was the occasional LTM but everyone enjoyed them equally. Fast forward a few months and epic decided to always keep one big team mode in the queue. 

Now, those players never play solos, duos, or squads, because they get destroyed by good players and ttv tryhards alike. They play in the LTM modes only, leaving only good players and ttv tryhards. So now the players that used to be good are fighting mostly other good players and ttv tryhards, making it seem as if they are actually performing badly now.

The fix? Well, I’m not sure. It’s true that it’s not fun to be stomped by tryhards, coming from the perspective of casual players, but then them leaving makes even the good players get stomped very often. Maybe epic should try skill based matchmaking. The community decided against it months back, but it might be time to revisit.

TLDR: casual players stopped playing normal solos, duos, and squads in favor of big team ltm’s, leaving mostly fellow good players and tryhards to prefer the unaltered gameplay of the normal mode.",FortNiteBR

So when the rex skin first released I bought it but after some hours i decided that i didn't like it and i send an email to the support team saying that i ""accidentally"" buy it. The support team not only gave my V-Bucks back but they didn't remove the skin from my locker. I still have rex to this day. That was the confession. I will probably get a lot of hate but i will also probably get rekt by the ""unfortunately we've had to remove your post"".

Getting any sort of med could save your life, the chances of you even picking up a throwable is low.

Personally, I think throwables should come out of ammo cans or be an extra potential drop out of a chest, with a guaranteed chance to spawn a med every time.

My solution allows the plane to basically become a glass cannon which makes it balanced as in it is strong, but weak.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey guys I had an idea because I feel like the planes are both in a good and bad state as they sit in almost all modes of Fortnite. So planes spawn with 800 health each. In squads, your team of 4 players has an option to take 4 planes or 1 plane, if your squad takes 1 plane, the plane can be considered a glass cannon when rolling up on another squad since the 4 people in the squad can shoot down a 800 health plane, however say all 4 of you take a separate plane, this becomes a tank with 3200 total health in all your combined planes. This makes it very hard for 4 people to shoot down 4 800 health planes. Same goes for Duos, your duo could take 1 plane and be considered a mediocre threat to a duo without a plane, or you could be a tank and take 1600 health worth of planes between the two of you and become a serious threat to another duo. For solos, (the main mode i prefer) planes are nothing but tanks and bulldozers. If planes all had somewhere between 200-400 health instead of 800 I could see myself being able to make myself a fair chance against a guy who can shoot me infinity with an about 2 second cool down period and can fly wherever he wants. If i weaken him, or his plane, he is easily able to escape by gliding away, however i don't get this freedom when he is shooting at me. If all planes had 200-400 health then it wouldn't take a full AR clip to destroy a plane and the plane couldn't go through about 4 pre-built buildings (pretty powerful) before exploding. Let us keep in mind that the plane can hold 5 passengers, infinity shoot while moving with a small cool down period, and it is arguably the fastest way to go across the map in Fortnite. You can switch seats and exit the vehicle in less than a second so you hardly ever take vehicle explosion damage.

&amp;#x200B;

The way i decided on 200-400 health per plane was because if one squad took a plane then 4 people on another squad would do 200 damage each to shoot down the plane.

&amp;#x200B;

I have died to planes 3 times today and i played 14 matches today, I made a video explaining everything above if you would like me to link it somehow (I'm old but new to posting on reddit).",FortNiteBR

So I came up with a solution. You play against your own platform and from 0-10 points you play with people with scores in that range and for 11-25 you play with people with scores in that range. For example you're on Xbox so you play with xbox players. And say you have 5 points then you play with people with scores of 0-10 so then people on consle won't get an unfair game because of some personal players. Anyone agree,FortNiteBR

I’m brand new to PC (2 days) coming from counsel.  I know people are going to comment and tell me that I should be doing what’s most comfortable for me but I’m mostly looking for advantages/disadvantages of key bind placement.  I’m not comfortable with anything yet and want to start off with the most advantageous key binds so I can get used to them right away.  

I have played around in playground for about 5 hours total and I’ve tried a bunch of binds. From all building on my mouse (Logitech g502) to mixing builds on mouse/keyboard.  

Weapon switching seems to be the hardest for me right now.  Using my ring finger for 1/2 and index for 3-5 is very awkward but I assume that I will get used to it as I go.  

My pinky rests more comfortably on the caps lock than it does left shift.  Probably because I have larger than normal hands.  

This is what I came up with as potentially the most comfortable and am seeing what the opinions are with these binds.  

What specific disadvantages can you see me having with the below binds? 

DPI (1500) I know this is a lot higher than competitive players but I cannot go any lower. I can control and move this speed well.  

Pooling 1000

Mouse sens X/Y - 0.15
Mouse targeting sens - 0.80
Scope sens - 0.55
Sprint by default - ON (so I don’t need a bind for sprint) 

W/A/S/D to move 

Jump - space 
Sprint - not bound
Crouch - Caps Lock (where pinky naturally rests) 
Reload - mouse wheel clicked in 
Use - mouse wheel to right 
Harvesting tool - mouse wheel to left 

Weapon slot 1 - Q
Weapon slot 2 - E 
Weapon slot 3/4/5 - 1/2/3

Wall - thumb mouse button 2 (5 on g502)
Floor - thumb mouse button (4 on g502)
Stairs - G-shit (mouse button below the wall and floor) 
Roof - Left Shift 

Trap - X 
Rotate building - R 
Building edit - F 
Inventory - Tab 

Notable keys that are not bound - Z, X, and V

I’m comfortable building 90s with this set up.  I’m actually a lot better than I was using a controller, however, I can’t find a place that I’m comfortable using the floor yet.  I’ve tried Q, F, V, C, and the buttons on the mouse.  For some reason I just can’t find a place that I think it will become very comfortable.  

I’m open to listening and trying anything that anyone will suggest! Thanks! ",FortNiteBR

* **Things that need to be vaulted/unvaulted** 
   * Vaulted 
      * Boombox | Just another way Epic is destroying building. 
      * Port-a-fortress | Rarely used beyond start of the game when it’s the only thing you found. 
      * Mounted Turret | Still just as stupid as when it was first put in the game. 
      * Submachine gun | Look at the unvaulted section. 
      * Compact SMG | Look at the unvaulted section. 
      * Six shooter | Actual worse weapon in the game, never used ever, waste of code. 
   * Unvaulted 
      * Tactical SMG | Adds more SMG variety then the current ones. 
      * Silenced SMG | Adds more SMG variety then the current ones. 
      * Dual pistols | Something to assist your shotgun other than an SMG. If added back, give it FSA and reduce pull out time from .57 seconds-&gt; .45 seconds 
      * Bouncers | In the game with Port a fortress, just give us them normally. 
* **Things that need to be changed** 
   * Burst AR’s 
      *  increase damage for each rarity by 1 
      * Increase speed to get FSA 
      * Decrease time between each burst 
   * Scoped AR
      * Increase damage for each rarity by 1  
   * Tactical Shotgun 
      * Reduce bloom 
      * Increase damage by at least 3 for each rarity 
   * Hand Cannon 
      * Decrease structure damage from 150-&gt;125 
      * Decrease pull out time from .53 seconds -&gt; .43 seconds 
   * Balloons 
      * Give it a sound so the opponent can’t sneak up and delete you before you have a chance. 
   * Planes 
      * Let me tell you what this is: Health of an ATK, boost ability and structure damage of a quad crasher, and it’s also a turret. BAD. 
      * Reduce it’s health 800-&gt;600 
      * Damage when it explodes goes to shields 
      * Reduce the damage of the turrets or better yet, take them out completely. 
* **General Gameplay Changes** 
* Double shotgun 

This is a maybe. If ever added back, get rid of 2 of the same shotgun, double pump, double heavy is a no no. If the SMG’s swap back and we get the dual pistols back and the hand cannon changes then this isn’t needed, although wanted by many. 

* Reduce bloom on everything. 

 This has been needed forever. I get that bloom is needed but it needs a reduction on everything. This will make the game more enjoyable for players who are good, while also helping the not so good players with their precise aim. 

* Issues 
* I play on the switch version personally (only thing I have) But the framerate is garbage, so that needs to be fixed. 
* Music cutting out, background music and emote music (this happens to me all the time) 
* Some things not rendering in, such as my own character model not rendering so it looks like play doh, or the lines on my scope (no seriously) not rendering. 
* The ziplines are buggy as hell, so they need to be fixed. 
* There has been a higher amount of blank hitmarkers, which is annoying, did it hit or did it not? 
* Most of the skins that I see on the switch are the commando skin but slightly different. About 90% of the skins I see are the same damn thing.

I know people are going to comment and tell me that I should be doing what’s most comfortable for me but I’m mostly looking for advantages/disadvantages of key bind placement.  I’m not comfortable with anything yet and want to start off with the most advantageous key binds so I can get used to them right away.  

I have played around in playground for about 5 hours total and I’ve tried a bunch of binds. From all building on my mouse (Logitech g502) to mixing builds on mouse/keyboard.  

Weapon switching seems to be the hardest for me right now.  Using my ring finger for 1/2 and index for 3-5 is very awkward but I assume that I will get used to it as I go.  

My pinky rests more comfortably on the caps lock than it does left shift.  Probably because I have larger than normal hands.  

This is what I came up with as potentially the most comfortable and am seeing what the opinions are with these binds.  

What specific disadvantages can you see me having with the below binds? 

DPI (1500) I know this is a lot higher than competitive players but I cannot go any lower. I can control and move this speed well.  

Pooling 1000

Mouse sens X/Y - 0.15
Mouse targeting sens - 0.80
Scope sens - 0.55
Sprint by default - ON (so I don’t need a bind for sprint) 

W/A/S/D to move 

Jump - space 
Sprint - not bound
Crouch - Caps Lock (where pinky naturally rests) 
Reload - mouse wheel clicked in 
Use - mouse wheel to right 
Harvesting tool - mouse wheel to left 

Weapon slot 1 - Q
Weapon slot 2 - E 
Weapon slot 3/4/5 - 1/2/3

Wall - thumb mouse button 2 (5 on g502)
Floor - thumb mouse button (4 on g502)
Stairs - G-shit (mouse button below the wall and floor) 
Roof - Left Shift 

Trap - X 
Rotate building - R 
Building edit - F 
Inventory - Tab 

Notable keys that are not bound - Z, X, and V

I’m comfortable building 90s with this set up.  I’m actually a lot better than I was using a controller, however, I can’t find a place that I’m comfortable using the floor yet.  I’ve tried Q, F, V, C, and the buttons on the mouse.  For some reason I just can’t find a place that I think it will become very comfortable.  

I’m open to listening and trying anything that anyone will suggest! Thanks! ",FortNiteBR

OG (adj) original gamer/gangster
So what does original mean in fortnite? In my opinion it means before the first battle pass. So therefore the black knight and sparkle specialist are not OG. They are rare. However; the recon expert and renegade raider are OG as they dropped before season 2.
Additionally people called the black knight ""old"". Old, in my opinion cannot be used as the dire could be called old this time 2020. That just makes everything before it older and basically dedtroys the comparison. 
Rare means not many people have it. Pretty simple definition. Many skins are rare like the sgt. green clover but it is not OG 

Let me know what you think, is season 2 og and how old is OG? ",FortNiteBR

What i don't understand is why over the last few weeks, epic hasn't changed it. Topic two, builder pro on console is shit, there should not be a requirement to press a button twice to place the structure, then holding down the button to place multiple doesn't work. Topic 3, ever since this season began yesterday, building was changed to place items 3 blocks away not the 1-2 it was (varied at angle you were looking). Now to build directly in front of you, you must look nearly straight down, which then makes you and easy target. I've talked too a couple people who all have said they are noticing the same thing with building. I feel like poor game design, bugs, and reasonable weapon balance, would improve the game. Before anyone says, ""but its early access"", bs, this is a live service game at this point, with all of epic behind it, development is fast asf. Anyway good day everyone, here's to many future w's.

Correct me if im wrong, but I only know of a few factors that effect how much exp you get per game. Those are kills, time survived, and challenges completed. Obviously completing the challenges is going to be the best thing to do first, but afterwards what? Should you que solo and just hide the whole time trying to make it as long as possible, or just spam tilted/divot and try to rack up as many kills as you can? Also do you get more exp queing solo or squad? Im not sure if these questions even have answers, but any thoughts/discussion would help a lot!!",FortNiteBR

That guy is basically an immortal superman. Must be fun for the guy rushing but it ruins the experience for the other player. That changes the core gameplay way too much and in my opinion has no place in the normal game mode. Hop rocks would be way more suitable for a limited time mode. People who like hop rocks could have their fun with them and people who prefer classic Fortnite could play normally.

He suddenly came across an alcove with a team of all female players, huddling in a hastily built hut that was only half finished. firing at a squad in the distance.

He pulled up and was like ""what up ladies i got a big LMG""

They startled in fear, firing upon him. But he quickly smacked their guns away with his large and immaculate pickaxe \(from the new battlepass\). His giant lollypop was succulent and looked incredible. He built a wall behind them and cut off one of the team mates \(who was most likely a rando, judging by her other team mates ignoring her and running away.

He started to pull out the wiggle dance and began to mesmerize her. You see it was his trick, his niche, they always fell for the wiggle. Suddenly she started undressing letting that T H I C C A S S out of them tight jeans. John wick, more like john dick? his thick lolipop smacked her across the face, sending sweat and candy deliciousness of his member splattering across the building behind her. Her face looked as if she had been munching on a snack like a landwhale after she sucked up and down his large Battle Pass pick axe shaking her large battle ASS….

He blew shot for shout out of his golden gun and finished her off with his white pistol. She had lost the game and her mind, as he finished her off, slurp juice coming out of her mouth, he put up the “200 iq” emote, smacking her ass, and finishing her as he went to finish the game.

Since back blings have officially been a thing has there been any released that aren’t just a different backpack?

For example, why couldn’t the Rex outfit have had actual dinosaur spikes and/or a tail instead of a backpack with them? And how come with the new super hero themed season 4 there isn’t a sign of a single cape back bling?? (Maybe epic are just real big Edna Mode fans).

But holy crap I am bad. I always end up landing way after everyone and get one shot from someone I can't see. I'm getting better at building. I can't figure out how to play though. Sometimes I'll pop off and get 13 kills, sometimes I lose 6 in a row in and get like 84th. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or how to analyze where I could improve.

I collect mats all game

I can build somewhat

I can aim from years of fps on PC

So I did some data collecting, and here is what I found:

*You start at 100 XP to get to level 2 from level 1.
*Leveling up adds exactly 100 XP to the previous amount needed. (300 for level 3, 400 for level 4, etc.)
*Every 5th level, an additional 50 XP is added on top of the 100 XP from the point above. (If you reach level 5, you will need 650 XP to get to level 6, instead of 600)

Pretty simple, right?  The good news is, **XP progression between levels is effectively linear,** or, for those who are a little less mathematically inclined, the amount of XP you need to get does't increase by an insane amount between two high levels.  This means you don't need to quit your job to just solely focus on going from level 79 to level 80.

Alright, so we figured out how the XP progression works, let's put it into a formula.  If we ignore the additional XP for every 5th level for now, the formula for how much XP you'll need to get from a certain level L to the next level N is simply: N = 100 * L + 100.  The hard part comes with that additional 50 XP we get every 5 levels.  I admit, it took me a little bit to figure this one out, but just counting those extra 50 XP's, we can calculate how much of those we will accumulate by adding ⌊L/5⌋ * 50 to the above function (where ⌊L/5⌋ is basically rounding down the result of L divided by 5).  This gives us the final function for XP needed to reach the next level N given a current level L: N = 100 * L + 100 + ⌊L/5⌋ * 50.

Alright, if you're still with me here, and haven't skipped to the TL;DR by now, I think that's great, and you are a terrific person.  Anyways, now we have this function, but we still don't know how much XP we need in total to get that sweet sweet full armor set for our homeboy Omega.  You guys made it this far, so I'll save you the boring stuff, and just flat out tell you that you need **354,000 total XP to get to level 80.**  HOLY SHIT!  Yeah, that's what I said too when I first saw that number.  Take a deep breath, relax, I've got some comforting truths for you.  The Battle Pass includes 5 1,000 XP rewards, which brings our total down marginally to 349,000.  But, lucky us, there's also the Daily Challenges!  70 days in the season means we get 70 500 XP boosts to our score, for a total of 35,000 XP, bringing out total down to 314,000 XP.  That's still a lot of freakin' XP, but there's one more thing to consider: the weekly challenges.  If we follow the same pattern as Season 3, we can expect 9 more 5,000 XP rewards, plus the 2 we already have from week 1 and the Starter set.  That's a total of 55,000 XP, assuming we keep getting 5,000 XP rewards for the rest of the season.  That brings our leftover total to 259,000 XP.  Yeah... I'll just let that sink in for a minute.

259,000 XP, just from playing the game.  I'll be honest, that's a lot of Fortnite, even for a burnt out college kid about to go on summer break.  We've got 70 days in the season, so that works out to **3,700 XP per day, just by playing the game normally.**  Wow.  I'm being serious here, if you see someone with a fully suited Omega coming after you, just leave the session.  You're screwed.

So, how do I wrap all this math up?  Well, if you want that full suit for Omega, you're gonna have to put your time in.  Luckily, we have XP boosts with the Battle Pass, so that will help reduce your suffering a pretty good amount.  Other than that, do ALL, and I mean **ALL** of your daily and weekly challenges.  If you get the full set, you'll pretty much be a god for all I care.

TL;DR:  How about a Q&amp;A?

**How much XP do I need to get all of Omega's armor?**
Roughly 349,000 total XP, assuming I did the math right.

**Am I playing enough to hit level 80?**
No.  Get off Reddit.  Get into Battle Royal.  Call off sick tomorrow.  And the next day.  And the day after that.  But seriously, the more you play, the better off you'll be.

**How can I get XP faster?**
*Do all of your daily and weekly challenges.  This, plus the 5 1,000 XP bonuses included as prizes in the Battle Pass, will take your total down to 259,000 XP.
*Play with friends that also have the Battle Pass.  Remember those Friend XP Boosts you get every so often?  Use those to your advantage, and your friends will benefit, too.
*Overall, just keep playing.  The more you practice, the better you'll get, and the more XP you'll get per match.  Prioritize survival time, eliminations, and winning, as those seem to get the most XP per match.

**If you find any math errors, or if I'm just plain wrong and I'm up here making a fool of myself, let me know, I'll fix things when I get home from work.  Also, check my formula- see if it holds true for your next level's needed XP.  I'm only on level 20 so far, so any feedback will be greatly appreciated.**",FortNiteBR

This allows whales to get the skin much easier just like before. The grind to 80 with all that XP is not difficult and makes it much less rewarding for people who do grind, because everyone has the skin, just like with John Wick. 

It would be really nice if there was a DIFFICULT skin to earn, like get 10-20kills in one match, win 50-100 matches, win a solo squad game.

I think that the small areas they add, they should keep, here is what I am addressing. 

The Chinese Shrines that were around they should have kept, it added Chests to some dead areas like below Anarchy and near Salty. They had chests and two ammo crates at the bottom. Now all that is left are stone buildings with no ammo crates, and a possible floor spawn. 

The Christmas Trees should have stayed, because I have yet to see as many people going to Wailing than at that time, when there was one right near the maze. It also made the center of Pleasant more fun to go to, because there were a max of three chests to go to instead of just one, made it a bit more fair off the rip.

Now the camp sites with the telescopes... why not keep them? They made that dead area in-between gas and race track interesting, they had an ammo crate sometimes and max of two chests, and they made the tops of otherwise dead mountains in the middle of the map have some mid-game loot like meds and possible scars. 

I think that if you kept these, and keep adding the new areas, like craters and whatnot, it would make the map interesting. 

On a side note, I also think that Reels should have went near the Motel and the Mine on the left side of Anarchy, and leave 1/3 of Dusty, Trees, Factory, Crate Stack, and Small House alone, and put the meteor site on the left side of Anarchy. No one goes there, and it would have brought more attention to that side of the map, and put it a greater distance away from Tilted. Also putting Reels on the edge of the map at the top like that, would be the counterbalance to putting Lucky on the edge at the bottom. 

I know some of these things are seasonal, but why not keep them around, to make the map a bit more fascinating. ",FortNiteBR

After seeing all the new stuff in Season 4, including unlockable items based on level, I was interested to see about how many matches it would take to reach level 80 for the final Omega gear based on average XP per match.

In doing so, I ended up with a spreadsheet calculator where you can input your expected experience per match, taking into account Daily, Weekly, and Starter challenges XP earned as well. You'll then get an estimated number of matches at that average to reach level 80 for Season 4. 

**Spreadsheet Use Directions**

[Link to Google Doc Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1InCarGbWahPaRopPizrTNUaq2HqsxuMRsUsZFi7_itg/edit?usp=sharing)

- Open link

- File &gt; Make a Copy to your own Google Drive &gt; Input your data

**If there's a better way to share this without it being protected and requiring a copy, please let me know*

**Customization Options**

You can also change the number of weekly or daily challenges you expect to finish by the end of the season. I defaulted to the following:

- 10 weekly challenges which each provide a total of 10,000 experience (*correct me if i'm wrong*)

- 70 daily challenges at 500xp per challenge

- Completion of starter challenges

**Final Notes**

I used information from u/Autofarer through [this link](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7o4c1k/you_need_roughly_1_million_xp_to_reach_lvl_100/) to get the total level 80 XP required. As noted in that link, the XP numbers might be a tiny bit off, but likely doesn't have much impact on requirements for level 80. 

**Let me know if I've missed any experience opportunities and remember that your input is based off your expected average xp per match which would include bonus xp from the battle pass.*

**If there's a better way to share this without it being protected and requiring a copy, please let me know, this was the best I could think of for sharing.*

So a few weeks ago me and my friends had him play with us, because he’s too young to have online friends so it makes it hard for him to play squads. Well he had never won before and we were going through just playing squad games, and on like our third or fourth one me and my friends started tearing up and eventually won it. My brother died in tilted, but it didn’t matter he’s a good sport, and he got so excited when he won, like I don’t know how to explain it but it genuinely made me happy hearing how excited he was. I felt great. Well fast forward to today, and I’m getting on his PlayStation to buy him the battlepass so he can get some new skins and shit because he still uses the no skin, and his PS4 turns on and it’s the screen shot of me and my friends in a circle dancing after the win. And damn it’s a great feeling knowing that we made his day like that. I don’t know if you guys will care about this, but I just wanted to share it. Me and my two friends play with randoms sometimes now and try to get them wins if they haven’t won it, and it’s a great feeling. I love it",FortNiteBR

I played with friends and it was a lot easier to get to top 20 or top 10 in Fortnite. I didn't have to strategize as much. The building aspect heavily played a part in my dislike of it. Almost every time I shot an enemy, they would start building and I just sighed to myself and ran away. I'm sure I can keep nitpicking at my likes and dislikes for each game but all in all, it just felt easier and PUBG presents a much more difficult challenge to me, as well as the thrill I get.

Legends say that you can get many V-Bucks by playing Save the World,

Globally, you get 50 per daily quest, approx 100-200 in each event questline,  so 400 per 2 months and somewhat with daily challenges.

If you buy the 40 dollar starter pack, it will take you approximately 2 months (by playing about an hour a day) to get the V bucks you could have got just by buying them from the store.

So, if you want to geg V-Bucks to spend on skins, go ask your mom for the cash, go mow the lawn, do baby sitting or anything else but do not buy StW.

We already have too many BR players that ruin the new players game because they do not know what is being co operative.

I understand the reason for it, though: having the players too dispersed ruins the game.

So, I propose this alternative mechanic:

The water around the island begins rising, flooding low-lying parts of the map, until gradually, only the  mountain peaks remain. You could swim for a limited time, but would eventually become exhausted and drown.

The playable area still shrinks, but it's predictable. Players would have to get what they can from the cities and then hurry to the hills to establish forts. They'd build higher and higher until running out of materials, and then only one remains alive, while the others are either killed or drowned.",FortNiteBR

To preface this- I’m fully tone deaf and hearing aids do not help at all, and audiologists agree that cochlear implants would also likely never work as well. Just completely D E A F since birth.

My point is, I have zero way of benefitting from the audio indicators of gunfire, footsteps, and building.

I have noticed that [the mobile version of Fortnite](http://imgur.com/Ao86dUw) has visual indicators of what sounds are being “triggered” and even will show which direction the sounds are being made. I believe orange indicates gunfire, and grey indicates footsteps. I’m not sure what color represents building.

This would be an amazing feature to utilize for deaf gamers, but it seems to not be an option. I want to say that I do understand that having that type of visual indicator WHILE also benefitting from superior audio from console/PC could be way unfair so my suggestion is some sort of a toggle? 

An option in accessibility to choose/turn on ‘Visual Indicators’ at the cost of losing ‘Audio Assist’ or vice versa. Again, this would be beyond amazing for deaf gamers and in my opinion would also go a LONG way in solidfying a quite large deaf population of gamers.

His eyes lit up when I asked him about the Meteor impact. His response was a big grin and to say ""How did you know about that?""

That being said his birthday is coming up and when I asked him what he wanted all he said was X Box live cards. It is literally the only thing he tells anyone he wants. We will undoubtedly buy him some but is their anything else Fortnite oriented that we can get him that will help his game? I Googled Fortnite merch but all that came up was a few hoodies and shirts that say strait outta Tilted Towers.

Is there anything I can get him that will actually improve his game other than X Box cards, and is there any cool merch I can pick up?

Anyways I digress:

The first clue came when i saw the post by /u/liukka123 where he found a [a rocket silo near Snobby Shores](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8g7igj/rocket_near_pleasant_park/)

The second thing that lead me to believe this is that the skin after completing 7 weeks of challenge is called ""Blockbuster."" this is where it gets interesting to me:

[BlockBusters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_bomb) were the largest bombs made in WWII, they were called Blockbusters because they could literally destro and entire City Block with one bomb.

While this is all speculation im sure someone with better attention to detail and time will find more clues and the season goes on.

For starters, I'm not a fan of the theme. I think it brings an element to the game that doesn't fit well. This includes most of the skins as well as the movie sets and secret villain lairs near lonely lodge and snobby shores. 
Then you have the meteor rocks. This just reminds me of how Call of Duty added the exosuits. Everyone thought it was gonna be a great idea, but then it ruined the franchise. This is no different to me. I don't like the idea of players flying around. It adds an aspect of the game that is completely unnecessary.

The skins are an eyesore as well. I love the squad leader outfit and the Hawk dude, because they fit well into the aesthetics of the Fortnite universe. But Valor, Zoey, the blue guy, and even Omega just don't... look right. 

I know I come off as a massive hater or complainer. Feel free to disagree with me, but I really am gonna miss the times when the game was more simple and had a consistent aesthetic/feel to it. I hope Season 5 is much better. ",FortNiteBR

** Why on earth is weapon swap delay a thing? Noone had a problem with the god damn game and  you just decided to add this huge delay to weapons and slowed the pace of the game sooooo freaking much.Weapon delay was just a horrible idea and it should have been long gone.Let me tell you why its a horrendous change. Feel free to tell me i'm wrong and why.

Fortnite was unique in the sense that it was really fast paced compared to the other battle royale games, adding the delay just slows down the game for no reason.They said "" Reduce the burst damage that could be output"" I'm assuming the purpose of the delay was to target double shotty and people using pump/tac.Delay did pretty much nothing to pump/tac , its still your best bet for CQC.However the delay 

A)Delay literally murdered deagle/revolver, revolver was already a sh*t tier weapon and the damage fall off + weapon delay absolutely made it useless, who the hell thought it was a good idea to add a delay to the revolver seriously?? 


B)Made the game slower, edit pump plays are long gone, and building fights between two good players feel like ass because you have to wait for an eternity to pull out a pump.

C)Completely killed diversity, back in the day you could rock 1 pump and be perfectly fine, now you are pretty much forced to use pump/tac,because you can't just use pump now because it's soooo slow and you WILL be punished if you try to make fast plays with editing/building, and if you just use a tac, you will straight up get destroyed in CQC against someone that has pump/tac.

All this for what? Yes they may have nerfed pump/tac just a tiny tiny bit, but they ruined so many great features of the game.Solution? Just revert the weapon delay and maybe work on a better solution for the double shotty meta because adding delay is certainly not the way to go.

** Another thing thats kinda frustrating but not as big of a deal is the delay that added to pickaxe, like PLEASE stop adding a delay to things that aren't broken,  just because tryhards destroyed 2-3 trees more than someone who didn't use the swapping technique you make pickaxes feel clunky by adding them a delay too.. :(

Please stop ruining the good features of the game and work on bigger problems like bloom and QOL features.I really miss the fast playstyle of the game before all these delays its just sad to see such an awesome fast paced game getting slower and slower.

TLDR:Delay is a poinltess doo doo change and adding delay to everything is kind of killing the game.",FortNiteBR

This game needs the variety of these guns to keep it balanced. You can’t remove it and then replace it with an Epic and Legendary P90. 

If you want to have a good game overall, you need both bad and good weapons. Not every weapon needs to be a strong weapon, you NEED balance, and some of you just don’t seem to understand that for whatever reason. It’s like you expect that every chest you open should automatically give you a top tier gun. 

News flash people, you don’t need a top quality gun to kill an opponent, you just have to either be more skilled than them, or out play them. How does that occur? By practicing and getting better at the game, not by just giving you a good gun every time. ",FortNiteBR

– A first person mode. 
– The ability to rejoin games you've lagged out of. 
– The ability to spectate friends if they're in a game. 
–  A more consistent schedule for LTMs. For instance, we get a new one every 2 weeks or so and they would keep going until the 2 weeks are up. This way there is always something new. 
– More ways to PvP. What I mean by this is other game modes. For instance a Capture The Flag would benefit a lot from the building mechanic  and it would be different because you could build your base, place traps, add balconies, and windows.

But I really think that the biggest difference between the truly great players is something I like to call ""battle sense.""

&amp;nbsp;

Battle sense is the difference in knowing when to take your shots, or when to engage with your enemy in a built fight or something as simple as building a base when they have no idea where you are. There's a skill to being able to pick your battles in order to guarantee whether or not you're able to win fights and ultimately get Victory Royales.

&amp;nbsp;

The best players have a feel for the situation at hand and always react accordingly while just the ""good players"" play within a certain expectation of their own skills and play in their own way.

&amp;nbsp; 

Stick skills can cap at a certain point, but being the smartest fighter possible is what can take your game to the next level.

We really need a separate sensitivity slider for build mode. As a console player, you have to choose between having a high sens so you can build quickly at the cost of aim or having it set lower so that you can aim with greater precision at the cost of speed building. I'm always trying to turn up my sensitivity so that I can build more quickly, but I inevitably have to turn it back down as it hurts my combat too much. This is especially true with the jump shotty meta we currently have, since you have to take your finger off the joystick to jump.

We also need the option to turn off aim assist when editing building. This slows the editing process way down and sometimes when trying to edit the direction of stairs I have to move my character to get it to do what I want because the aim assist is holding it in place so strongly.

Epic, you guys have been doing great so far in adding things for the community so *please* add these huge quality of life changes for console players.

They do literally anything. 

They shoved aside the current standard of having to screw over players with AAA game standards of 4 million microtransactions. They demolished the ridiculous backlash the BR mode received when it debuted to pave the road to a bright future. They set the new standard for the gaming industry. 

Epic Games has grown their little, tiny product into the biggest game in the entire world. They did this through the most user-friendly, player welcoming business model I have ever seen, with an infinite progression system that ALWAYS has players returning. The dynamic and newly fleshed out feel the game has every week because of the care the devs put into making sure the game has new content every, single, frickin week. 

They did this by developing the healthiest, and absolute best by an absolute mile relationship from their developers to their very own community. Fortnite has a community thousands and hundreds of thousands times bigger than a metric ton of games, but still manages to stay closer than any other game corporation has ever managed to even attempt. 

I, my friends, and the entire Fortnite BR community would like to take our time to thank the absolute (excuse my language) fuckin best game corporation I have ever seen without a doubt by writing endless amounts of Reddit appreciation posts, and generating the healthiest community gaming has ever seen. 

Epic Games, thank you.

For example I bought my PS4 while abroad in Singapore and now I am stuck with O being accept/enter, and X being cancel/return (I believe all consoles sold in the Asian region have this swapped around compared to the NA/EU versions).

 which as you can imagine is causing a lot of issues with my muscle memory especially when it comes to quick inventory management I need to do in the middle of a game.

It's odd because X has always been accept/enter for me since I bought the early access StW version when it came out, before the swap accept and back option was even implemented in the game, but as of this patch it has forced it to change over to O and I have no way of getting it back to X as the swap accept and back option was also removed this patch.

NOTE: I'm not sure if this is confirmed or if someone has brought it up before, I've played Battle Royale all day and immediately came to Reddit after seeing all these areas.

So all we know right now, after all the teases, is that a comet and its pieces have crashed over the map. Everyone right now is in awe of Dusty Depot being destroyed instead of Tilted Towers and also amazed over the Superhero theme. The thing is, why would Superheroes just show up randomly over a comet? What makes this so special? Does this comet give our heroes their powers or is this not a comet at all?

So think about this, there has been enough time to set up this massive facility around the comet, yet the comet still continues to glow after all that time?

https://i.imgur.com/VQpSddN.jpg

Speaking of government, there are black vehicles surrounding every crater that was created due to the pieces of the comet. Does anyone else find it kinda fishy and menacing how they're all pitch black with the same logo and have never been showed before until now?

https://i.imgur.com/dwCJY7P.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/SVFQP49.jpg
https://i.imgur.com/XrfPJqZ.jpg

Going back to Superheroes, there's been two underground bases I've discovered. I think, the one in Salty Springs that seems worn out and under a regular home belongs to Carbide, who's description reads ""heed the call to action"", so maybe he did get his powers from the comet and is a new Superhero?

https://i.imgur.com/NHg7GIh.png
https://i.imgur.com/0HKfmPw.jpg

There's also the second one, South-East of lonely lodge underneath a mansion. This seems fresh and higher tech, there's also a logo as if it's an organization which brings me to Valor who's description reads ""a beacon for hope"", so maybe she's the one who's most known as the Superhero who's been around for years? Maybe starting something together with Carbide?

https://i.imgur.com/U41fMoT.png
https://i.imgur.com/J3dOKHR.jpg

Now, with every Superhero, there's also a Supervillain and who better than Omega? Who's menacing description reads ""there can only be one"", and come on look at the guy. He reminds me of Ultron. Have you seen the flashy building that's practically hanging off a mountain next to Snobby Shores? This is a typical flashy Supervillain lair. Not to mension the rocket in the middle of the building? Come on.

Finally, the hop rocks. They're a fun addition but i feel like they ruin the point of building, especially if you don't have one, and as there are quite a lot of them it's not like you can wait it out.

Hopefully it's just hype and people will start to spread out, i'm also hoping the hop rocks go as well for the reasons stated but we'll just have to wait.",FortNiteBR

1. The first game I played, when I jumped out of the bus, my camera zoomed out quite far, and I was not jumping in the direction I was looking.  Also, for a short time the controls were inverted, so moving the mouse up made my character look down, and so on.

2. I played one game where I landed at the prison (the POI right next to Moisty Mire).  I landed in the far east tower where there was a chest, and another player landed on a rare Tactical SMG right next to me.  I needed to grab the gun from that chest to defend myself, but when I opened the crate, the ammunition and the materials that spawned in it spawned normally, but the Blue Bolt-Action Sniper and the Grenades fell through the ground into the bottom level of the prison, and the guy with the smg pushed me and killed me since I did not have a gun to react.

3. In every game I have played so far, when the countdown ends before the match start, I get put into a loading screen before the battle bus shows up on my screen.

4. In the main menu, whenever I leave a party after readying up, the Play button will still say ""Unready"", and I cannot click off of it.  Also, the mode selection feature disappears after the same actions take place.

I hope this gets to Epic's eyes and they fix these issues, as well as any more I may post on this thread before the next patch.

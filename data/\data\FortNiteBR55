Note: we haven't had a major performance update since before Season 7.,"**These are only the bugs I can remember since they all happened today. I have a fiber optic wired connection on my PS4 Pro.**

1. Getting stuck inside ramps and being unable to move. Came with the recent trap ""fix""

2. Traps getting stuck in the middle of builds and blocking off all vision when on the wall behind you. Also came with the recent trap fix

2. Pump won't shoot

3. traps place in the middle of the world

4. traps completely block your ability to see

5. shadows on console

6. having your gun out, pickaxing, going into build mode, then swapping to your guns always resets to slot 1 on console

7. end game builds move in slow motion on console - new after the latest ""performance"" update

8. ghost shots - through open fields, trees where there's no hitbox that should block the shot, and walls

9. shooting through fully built walls - not only when your player model is sticking through the builds, but also when you have space between you and the wall

10. getting shot through rifts

11. instant place not working

12. building delay after using traps

13. microstutters

14. random jump fatigue

15. frame drops early and mid game

16. massive frame drops late game - this is more expected since building has advanced and more players survive/know how to tunnel correctly in arena. But recently my game has turned to syrup late game. Builds take forever to appear like they've finished building even when they're already full hp

17. aim assist DOES NOT WORK correctly - close range, mid range, it will assist your aim half of the time

18. GETTING SHOT THROUGH WALLS - literally through fully built walls. Bug when your arm is poking through and even when you're nowhere close to the wall

19. No aim assist when applying a bush

20. Audio cutting out footsteps, axing, and wall destruction

21. turbo build does not work

22. turbo build initial place delay reverted to 0.15s

23. Can't swap weapons in inventory too quickly or it won't register

24. Guns auto-shooting out of build mode...

Evidently the only priority is releasing new content, regardless of the number of bugs it brings. I've heard the argument that ""There are separate teams for content and bugs."" Of course, but really doesn't seem to be on performance and every content update brings more issues. Playing Champs in arena, on console, is already challenging enough.

Please, just fix the game. We have not had a major improvement to performance in all of Season 8, or 7. Every performance fix has been reversing more bugs that were added to the game.",FortNiteBR

Another theory I have is about the lava rising everywhere and the volcano erupting. When polar melts, the rest of the map should turn into some form of rock.

In no particular order, here it goes:

Thank you for making Team Rumble basically permanent. It helps so much with getting these fun challenges done every week, without ruining my 0.4(and climbing!) K/D Ratio. 

Thank you for giving me an ever changing map, with new POI's, and terrain changes over the seasons. The game feels fresh every season, and I enjoy that.

Thank you for adding different vehicles here and there, and then removing or changing them so it doesn't get stale. I'll never forget rolling with my buddies in a plane, while blowing my Battle Horn off the wing.

Thank you for adding an arena mode, where I can play with more competitive mechanics, and truly see where I stack up against the other Division 2 players. 

Thank you for adding Creative and Playground, so that I can practice my building and editing, as well as any new weapons or items that come out. 

Thank you for giving us a free Battle Pass this season, even if it does have outfits that I'm not really a fan of, I've enjoyed progressing through it.

Thank you for giving some of my favourite older skins new options.

Thanks for adding new consumables throughout the world, I am especially a fan of those speedy peppers in the desert.

Thanks for adding Weapon Wraps, I love the Magma wrap and if it wasn't so bright I'm sure I'd be able to see the fear in my opponents eyes as my shotgun blast goes JUST wide of his head.

Thanks for adding these cannons. One of my most memorable matches of the season was in Duos where we landed on the pirate ship, and got into a long drawn out cannon battle with another team in the town to the east. We didn't win. 

Finally, thank you for being a F2P Cross Platform game. You have given me the opportunity to game with friends and co workers that I never would have gotten a chance to before. I can play with my younger brother, and the game has allowed me to reconnect with him in a way I didn't think possible.

14,Icecal,1554305102,b8zd4v,116,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/b8zd4v/i_changed_my_mind_on_820/,270,I changed my mind on 8.20,"Reading the patch note one week ago I felt like ""What did they just do ?!"". I was enjoying the Pop-up Cup mechanics and I was really surprised that they removed it, not in a positive way to say the least.

&amp;#x200B;

After one week of playing, I kind of changed my mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that 50Hp per kill made people playing too aggressive, only rushing brainlessly for kills, with no strategy at all.

I do not talk about thirsting or 3rd partying which will always be part of the game, but players were all (more than now) landing first drop, rushing in 50/50 fights and I do not think that it was good for the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel that you have to use your brain more now before taking a fight. 

""How much mats do I have?"", ""Where is the next circle?"", ""Is there any other player nearby?"" were questions that we did not even need to ask ourselves before taking a fight with Pop-up Cup mechanics in normal mode.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that I really do miss is the +40% farm speed. I think that it feels really slow now so maybe try like +20% farm speed and 700 mats cap.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I think that all those mechanics, especially Siphon, are good for Arena mode because it reward players that take risks in a mode where you can also gain more points by playing for placement, but normal game modes are in a better state without it.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again that's just my opinion and I am really curious to know yours.

Its easy 100 damage (or more)  on anyone not expecting it, without the risks of a sniper. If the person with the bow has decent aim, anyone with low/no mats is guaranteed dead. 

My proposal is Epic balances the explosive/impact damage to be 50 impact/50 explosion. It raises the skill since you have to actually hit a shot to do a lot of damage, and if you can get a headshot it would deal 150, giving it more of the sniper feel. (Epic added it to SS so i guess its a sniper)

**Placements points should not be unlocked until you get a kill.** 

1 kill for the first placement points, and 2 kills for the rest. This would help slower players trying to learn their way from being ranked up when they are not ready to be.  If you are a newish player in arena, you are going to be dropping cold, taking your time and not jumping into battles, you're going to want to get a feel for the mode.

Within a few hours of playing, you can find yourself in a division above your skill level due to a placing top 15 without doing anything.

Even if you are solid Div 4 player, if you play enough games you are going to see yourself in div 5/6 after a couple of days grinding.

This is then going to push these players back into getting bodied by player who are way better than them, across all levels.",FortNiteBR

Grass will eventually grow and the the hole will look like it was never there. They will start to repair the depot, and trucks will come with supplies to make the depot even bigger, it will attach to a new factory (not an exact copy of the OG factories), and will have road extensions from salty springs. 

BUT HEY, THATS JUST A THEORY. A GAME THEORY!",FortNiteBR

Siphon shouldn’t be removed from squads at LEAST. Not enough heals, farming isn’t fun at all, and if you get in a fight you are bound to lose health. Sitting in a box is an unhealthy play style and nobody really enjoys doing that. 

It’s always 1 step forward and 3 steps back for epic. We can never enjoy the game fully. And it’s actually embarrassing they make no comment, or even talk to anyone, about the removal of health and mats per kill. They said they ended a “test” with the siphon mode, and I don’t know about any of you redditors, but I saw NO complaints about it. So why take it out? It’d make a lot more sense if you said “we have concluded our test on the siphon addition to regular matches, and it seemed to have been accepted by the majority of the community, so we have decided to keep it in the game”. 

Instead, you insist that it promotes an unhealthy aggression, like the point of this game isn’t to eliminate all opponents. I just do not understand the thought process in these updates at all

Who in their right mind would agree that having a setting that makes 1 good player capable of wiping a casual squad of 4 people is balanced?

Im just wondering if these Sweats are listening to themselves, theyre basically saying the game was more fun when it catered to their ability to fight 4 people and win because of the shield per kill like 4 people against 1 was an even fight in the first place. Or the fact that when they shoot a (very loud) gun and build (very noticeably) that they should get extra health because people will be attracted to the skirmish and want to kill you in a (BatTlE RoYAlE) game

Note: we have not had a major performance update since before Season 7.,"**These are only the bugs I can remember since they all happened today.**

1. Getting stuck inside ramps and being unable to move. Came with the recent trap ""fix""

2. Traps getting stuck in the middle of builds and blocking off all vision when on the wall behind you. Also came with the recent trap fix

2. Pump won't shoot

3. traps place in the middle of the world

4. traps completely block your ability to see

5. shadows on console

6. having your gun out, pickaxing, going into build mode, then swapping to your guns always resets to slot 1 on console

7. end game builds move in slow motion on console - new after the latest ""performance"" update

8. ghost shots - through open fields, trees where there's no hitbox that should block the shot, and walls

9. shooting through walls

10. getting shot through rifts

11. instant place not working

12. building delay after using traps

13. microstutters

14. random jump fatigue

15. frame drops early and mid game

16. massive frame drops late game - this is more expected since building has advanced and more players survive/know how to tunnel correctly in arena. But recently my game has turned to syrup late game. Builds take forever to appear like they've finished building even when they're already full hp

17. aim assist DOES NOT WORK correctly - close range, mid range, it will assist your aim half of the time

18. GETTING SHOT THROUGH WALLS - literally through fully built walls. Bug when your arm is poking through and even when you're nowhere close to the wall

19. No aim assist when applying a bush

20. Audio cutting out footsteps, axing, and wall destruction

21. turbo build does not work

22. turbo build initial place delay reverted to 0.15s

23. Can't swap weapons in inventory too quickly or it won't register

Do we have any integrity for game performance? Evidently there is no priority outside of releasing new content with more bugs. I've heard the argument that ""There are separate teams for content and bugs."" Obviously, but their priority is nowhere on performance and every content update brings more issues.

Please, just fix the game. We have not had a major improvement to performance in all of Season 8, or 7. Every performance fix has been reversing more bugs that were added to the game",FortNiteBR

ever since the patch it has been harder to get shield, health, and mats. They should put the mat harvesting back and when you DOWN someone you get the mats and half of their ammo. The sifon should also be applied on knock. I think that your sifon should decrease through kills though for kills 1-3 you should get  50 health or shield. For kills 4-6 30, and for 6-8 10 health and  shield this will come with the options for maybe not being too aggressive and maybe go to arena mode to drop 30 bombs. 

I really do hope epic sees this and realizes that 3rd partying should be acted upon and that people don't want to carry a lot of heals during a game.

I use to love this game, I started halfway through season 4 and was obsessed with winning a solo.  After like 350+ games I finally won my first solo and loved the game. 

Now I'm at 99 (old stats), with 5 this season, this is just some context that I'm not terrible and can still win a game or two.

I just feel like there are too many frustrating things they have done to the game for me to play as much as I use to.

Nerfing farming does not make me want to play more, searching for shields does not make me want to play more, when I need a vehicle and it's not where they spawn because of rng it doesn't make me want to play more.

When I see an LTM I want to play but I don't want to play duo's or squads, it doesn't make me want to play more.

I'm not saying I'm quitting or that I hate the game, I just wish this game had more LTM's up with more options.

If say they had soaring solo's with siphon mechanics, one shot, slide, every day, I would play this game so much more.

But instead we have creative, and playground that I never want to even play.

Just my opinion on the game, and I'm honestly having more fun playing 2 other BR games on xbox right now.

The thing is, I love competitive gaming, but after getting to division 6 of arena and getting absolutely and utterly wasted by PC players, it’s just destroying my motivation completely. At this point, there is nothing I can do to improve to the point where I can compete with a person that can build, edit and shot before I can switch to my shotgun.

So epic. I have a question for you. What is the percentage of console versus pc players in the top tiers of arena? How are they performing? And I am not talking about controller players, but people playing on console.

Normally, I would just go and play solos at this point. But after being condition to health on kills, faster farming it’s... it’s just not fun anymore. This is the first time since the game released I am not enjoying myself at all.

So awhile back I linked my PS4 account and Xbox account, following [these steps](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/account-linking-steps), hoping to merge them. After waiting two weeks I realized I never actually started the *merge* process but only linked them. Now that they are both associated with my epic account, they can't be merged at the moment. I'm afraid to unlink them/one however, because I feel like I might lose my progress.

They requested many pieces of information but one that is impossible to provide is epic receipts for purchases. Since the email on file is incorrect I can't see these. To compensate for this I included the receipts from the eshop with their respective purchase numbers.

So about a week ago we got digging sites appearing around the map, players around could interact with these digging sites by breaking rocks covering whatever is under it, once some of the digging sites were finished it showed some pretty intresting things, see the image down below.  


[Left side is new stuff, Right side is old stuff back in Season 5\/4.](https://i.redd.it/swkvjsftcwp21.jpg)

  
As you can see these items that were dug up have been in the game before, No there not the same ones but they are similar to the other ones, the new Dig site in Dusty Divot revealed that there was another Meteor rock under the ground that players could discover by breaking the rocks, Meteors were also back in Season 4, Image is below.  


[Meteor Rock found in Dusty Divot new Dig Site.](https://i.redd.it/4lyhgt5gdwp21.png)

As you can see this was found in todays new update under the new digging site in Dusty Divot, Also the new Secret skin that can be unlocked by doing any of 7 weeks of challenges that have yet to be unlocked fully is called ""Discovery"" So there is something strange going on with old items that were from Season 4/5, Image below showing ""Discovery"" Skin.

Well there you have it, That's all that has been found so far that has to do with my Theory, thankyou for reading and make sure you set a reminder just incase this comes true.

Everyone was used to it and no one really complained, then Apex came out and started dominating so Epic decided to give the pop up cup changes to Fortnite and that eventually made people enjoy it more.

Then epic to it away out of nowhere and you just don’t do that, you can’t introduce great mechanics and take them away like that. Sure we have arena, the problem is I can’t squad with friends anymore since is boring and I just can’t casually play instead of camping in a box in arena.

People that defend this 8.2 update think like epic that new players won’t get stomped a good players, they still will, DOESNT matter the mechanics, old or new.

It’s just obvious, before 7.4 you would see Tfue on winstreaks and just pubstomping, this update doesn’t change that. I don’t really care about shields for kills, is the god dam farming that is just too long and boring, I don’t even think new players wanna sit around hitting trees all dam day. 

Shields per kill reduced rng, and fast farming rate made the game more aggressive but that also helps new players improve as they are able to practice building more. 

I’m high in points in arena, but arena should also help new players become better because they are placed against other players that are in low points, meaning they are in their skill level, that’s why point deduction should start since the first division.

Epic also gave different things such as creative to help people improve. There is indeed skill in fortnite and you won’t see a good player loose to a casual, Daequan said this on a tweet and is obvious, good players will stomp on bad players.

I used to play destiny, that game required skill (destiny 1), and every time I played the competitive modes I was getting stomped on for months until I catches up, is just how it is.",FortNiteBR

So I thought I’d try and share my opinions on the matter while trying to not be overly complainy.

Let me first say I totally understand the argument about it being bad for slower, more casual players. That makes sense.... if aggressive players stopped being aggressive. The truth of the matter is, as an aggressive player, I’m still gonna go balls to the wall. What makes me mad and I’m sure 99% of other aggressive players, is the fact that we may start off a game with 7 or 8 kills in the first few minutes but we are only rewarded in the form of 25hp left, 2 bandages and 19 wood. Kind of a crappy reward for being good at something.... and suddenly the player that avoided conflict for the first 5 to 10 minutes of the game, farming... Swoops in with hundreds of mats, ammo, shields and gets his/her first kill and possibly only kill of the game due to the aggressive player being so week after taking out almost a 10th of the lobby. 

Now let me dispel some garbage arguments some of you might bring up.

“It’s A BR game it’s about survival not getting lots of kills!”: that’s boring, that’s not fortnite, you want that I suggest trying out a TACTICAL BR game such as PUBG or Firestorm. Both fantastic games but feature a much slower or tactical play style. 

“What’s wrong with farming. It’s one of fortnites unique features”: I like the farming aspect but it’s too slow. If I wanted to farm materials for half a game I’d go play Minecraft. 

Now let’s talk about how HPK possibly benefited the slower players. 

Ever been in a huge fight with a guy or team and suddenly shots ring out from behind you? Then your panicking. Your pinched. Your getting third partied and third partied hard. Your chances are slim to none. Somehow you manage to kill the team in front of you but alas, your at 60hp, low mats and no shields for the impending push from the third party. Now your dead. Almost 0 chance to survive that anyway. On to the next one. With HPK you had a chance to take that fight or even a better chance at simply escaping. 

This is just one example.

Now let’s talk about how the game seemingly has “less aggressive players in pubs”. People like to say it’s because they all went to arena so they could play HPK. Don’t kid yourself. Arena, especially up in my current division is NOT an aggressive game mode. You like hiding? You like avoiding fights for survival? Try checking out high ranked arena gameplay. It’s a totally different game in there and as soon as the World Cup is over you can bet your bottom that the majority of those “aggressive” players that aren’t in pubs right now will trickle RIGHT back into them. Arena is a temporary deterrent to your so called “aggressive player” problem. 

What’s my suggestion? Yes they should re add HPK of course. Nerf it a little? Whatever. We just need SOME sort of reward for playing well. 

To those who enjoy the current play. I have some advice. Use this lack of high tier players in pubs to get better. Don’t drop in the middle of no where and hide for the win. Do what I did for months after I started playing this game. Drop yourself right into the center of tilted, retail, Viking, paradise or any high traffic area and push people, when you die figure out what you could’ve done better for next time. Is your building too slow? We have creative mode now, infinite mats and no fall damage. There’s no excuse for not at least practicing builds a little bit here and there. Optimize your key bindings and get used to them. Mess with your sensitivity. If your on console work on a different button layout. Put the time and effort in like all of us aggressive players did. And when you get better let me hear how you feel about being 7th partied from some dude who landed on the edge of the map.

After you changed the edit sensitivity to match the building sens and not the normal sens, editing was really problematic for many controller players, so there were many posts about adding an edit sensitivity slider or at least the option to decide if we want editing to match the building or the normal sensitivity. Nothing happened and i still cant get used to it because my building sensitivity is so high.

Another important point: the arena mode and the cups. Which console player in their right mind would like to play against pc players?

I can tell you: only the really good players, and these players mostly play already on pc.

So you definitely should make console only lobbies for arena mode and the other cups. I believe there was a really big post about this on the frontpage about this a few days ago.

To start, look at the shotguns that we've had and have now. The tac is pathetic. Sure, if a player shoots a pump and misses you might be able to get a kill with a tac, but that isn't likely. Let's say you land Loot Lake and get a blue tac. Someone else nearby gets a blue pump. What do you do now? If they're coming to fight you, you can't do much. Considering you just landed and don't have any shield, you have limited options. All they have to do is shoot the pump at you, and you are gone. Look at the heavy shotgun. It's balanced. It isn't a one shot king, and you have time to counter it. *It was a balanced shotgun, and it got removed because it was too weak. That is not right.*

Now let's look at the Double Barrel. Alright, this might have been too strong back before it was vaulted, but I think now, it could fit in the game. Sure, if you land both shots you'll get the kill, but if you miss one, you're dead. It has a huge reload time, and that gives that person with a pump plenty of time to destroy you. Maybe it could be changed to where it doesn't kill a person with full shield/health even if you land 2 bodyshots, but I don't know if that is needed.

Tactical: Bad  
Heavy: Balanced  
Double Barrel: Fairly Strong  
Pump: Almost Overpowered

Here are my ideas on how these shotguns could become more balanced:

Tactical: Vault. I just don't think it has a place in the game, at least right now.  
Heavy: Unvault it. Make it Common-Rare. Make sure the damage is lower than the Purple/Gold pump.  
Double Barrel: Unvault it. Maybe lower the bodyshot to under 100, but keep the headshot damage the same.  
Pump: This is a confusing one. I would vault the green and blue pump. The green pump is MUCH different from the blue one, and the blue pump is too strong for early game, considering it is common and very strong. Reduce the Purple/Gold pump damage by 5. Now the purple pump is the blue pump and the gold is the purple. The gold pump doesn't need 105 damage, so I would swap that out for something else, like a faster reload or better range, or something like that. Also decrease the fire rate AT LEAST. The pump could still be too strong, but that's all I can think of besides nerfing the damage, so I'm not sure about this one.

It helped out a lot when you were in a pinch and about to get third partied. 
40% increased farm rates and materials per elim were also unbelievably convenitent. 
However the game is not unplayable without these settings and I'm here to share my strategies for dealing with the current state of Fortnite.

1. Always pick up shields. 
-
Even if you're *convinced* you need a certain weapon or item over it, drop it and grab any blue juice you can.

2. Don't engage in any encounters
-
This is simple. If you hear any footsteps or shots, slowly walk in the opposite direction. 

3. Always pick up rift-to-gos
-
In case someone that knows how to build literally any simple structure spots your ass sneaking around, shake your rift so fucking hard until it feels like your arm will fall off. Holy SHIT dude shake that bitch so GODDAMN hard and yeet the FUCK outta there. 

4. But what about the 40% farming rate?
-
This sounds crazy but it's really trivial. 
What can you do with low amounts of material?

Just don't build.
Don't build any structures.

5. I've made it to top 2 without getting spotted and killed. What do I do?
-

Pray.

If the other guy is lazering you with his AR, don't build a wall in front of you to defend yourself. Make sure to panic and accidentally switch to a slot that has your shield potion and just fucking SHLORP that bitch RIGHT in front of him. Doesn't matter if you're getting shot just fucking CONSUME that shit. GLORP THAT BITCH SO FUCKING HARD holy SHIT dude SHHHLLLOORRRPP THAT SHIT

Enjoy.  
 

My Idea for future Fortnite Patches:  
 \-New Super Shield Bar (referred to as SS)  
 i Regenerates 1 SS and all times  
 ii Is treated like normal shield, so this will not protect from the storm, stink bombs, fall       

Damage, or lava  
 iii This SS bar will not be affected by:   
  1. Bandages  
  2. Medkits  
  3. Mini-Shield Pots  
  4. Shield Pots  
  5. Campfires (Both Scavenged and Traps)  
  6. All Scavenged items:  
   \&gt;Apples, Mushrooms, Bananas, Coconuts, and Peppers  
 iv Chug Jugs will put the SS bar to full, and the slurp juice will add to it, IF already at 

100/100  
 v This SS bar will be purple, and can hold a maximum of 50  
 vi 100/100/50 for a total of 250 health  
 vii SS still comes back over time +protects against damage while in DBNO state

\-Hunting Rifle adjustments  
 i Changed headshot multiplier to 2.8x so the hunting rifle deals 252 headshot damage, 

which is enough to still one hit kill somebody with 100/100/50 health  
 \-Explosive Weapons  
 i Grenade Launchers, Rocket Launchers, Quad Launchers, Dynamite, Grenades,  

Clingers, Bottle Rockets, and the Explosive Bow will ignore this SS bar, and deal 

damage directly to the 100/100 health and shield

\-Port-A-Fortress   
 i added back to normal playlist  
 ii Once thrown, takes 3 second arming time  
 iii Port-A-Fortress in 3 versions, wood, brick, and metal (Rare, Epic, Legendary)  
 \-Port-A-Fort  
 i added back to normal playlist  
 ii Once thrown, takes a 3 second arming time  
 iii Port a fort in 3 versions, wood, brick, and metal (common, uncommon, rare)  
 \-Quad Crasher adjustments  
 i Availability changed to 100%  
 ii Health increased from 400 to 550  
 iii Boost recharge speed decreased to .85 or original recharge speed  
 \-Quad Launcher   
 i added back to normal playlist  
 ii Only has 4 shots, once used, the gun immediately disappears from play  
 \-Scoped Revolver  
 i Reduced to Rare, Epic Rarity  
 ii Damage decreased to 42,44(84,88) to 34,36(68,72)  
 iii Reduced recoil to .75% of previous recoil factor  
 \-Pump Shotgun (Epic, Legendary)  
 i Increased headshot multiplier to a maximum of 2.28x  
 ii Allows 250 damage hits to happen. Still allowing one pumps from the epic/legend 

pump shotguns

\-Infantry Rifle(Uncommon/Rare)  
 i Keep damage, but decrease fire time to 2.5 from 4  
 ii Removed Damage falloff on player hits, but kept damage falloff for building damage

\-Balloons   
 i Can no longer use 3 balloons at the same time

ii When letting go of balloons at a height higher than 20 tiles, glider redeploy may be 

  used.  
 iii  If balloons item is dropped, balloons instantly pop   
 \-Tactical Shotgun  
 i Removed rare tactical shotgun  
 \-Heavy Shotgun(Epic Legendary)  
 i Added back to normal playlist  
 ii Range is the same, but damage falloff is increased. Only ‘useful’ at &lt;50 meters  
 iii Maximum headshot damage increased to 200/210 from 185/192  
 iv Maximum body damage increased to 80/85 from 74/77  
 v Clip increased to 8 from 7  
 vi Fire rate increased to 1.3 from 1  
 vii Use range to your advantage, and hit enemies before they get the chance(with low 

damage)  
 \-Drum Gun(Common/Uncommon)  
 i Drum gun added to normal playlist  
 ii Clip reduced to 20 from 50  
 iii Damage reduced to 19/20 from 26/27  
 iv Headshot multiplier reduced to 1.5x from 2x (28/30 from 52/54)  
 v Fire rate reduced to 6 from 9  
 vi Now a viable SMG, but not destructively overpowered as it used to be  
 \-Tactical SMG(Uncommon/Rare)

i Added back to normal playlist  
 ii Removed Epic variant  
 iii Body Damage decreased from 16/17 (Uncommon/Rare) to 10/11  
 iv Clip size reduced to 15 from 30  
 v Headshot multiplier reduced to 2x from 2.5x (Uncommon/Rare) (40/42 to 20/22)

vi Fire rate increased from 10 to 15  
 vii Reload time increased to 3/2.9 (Uncommon/Rare) from 2.4/2.3  
 viii Empties a whole clip in a second, but has a long reload time and low base damage  

for a one time use quick damage dealer to finish off opponents when in a fight  
 \-Grappler   
 i Added back to normal playlist  
 ii Reduced ‘clip’ to 5 from 10  
 \-Baller Adjustments  
 i All ballers on the map take storm damage 5x of normal damage (First zone takes 5 

damage/ second zone takes 10 damage/ etc.)  
 ii Total health decreased from 300 to 250  
 iii Speed reduced to .60% of previous speed  
 iv Boost recharge time increased by 1.5x (Takes longer to recharge)

v Baller no longer can destroy structures with more than 300 health (Can destroy  

wood/brick player built structures, but not metal. Can’t destroy most natural structures)  
 vi Baller grapple ability changes:

1. Once used, the grapple will stay in place for 5 seconds before being able to let 

Go (Can be used for more than 5 seconds, but for a minimum of 5 seconds)  
  2. Increased range of grapple to 1.3x of previous  
  3. Increased range of sound by 1.3 of previous  
 vii Player in the baller now takes ⅕  of normal fall damage  
 vii Player in baller can now get hit through the glass of the baller once the baller is at 100 

Health  
 viii Baller Hitbox adjusted  
  1. Any area that is cracked no longer has a hitbox when getting shot  
  2. Once at 100 health, the glass will shatter, and no longer have a hitbox (Stripped   
state)  
  3. The only way to hurt a stripped baller is to hit the metal frame on the 

inside  
  4. When in this stripped state, the player can be directly hurt while inside  
 ix When in this stripped state, baller speed increased by 150%, and boost recharge 

speed increased by 150%. However, without the glass to hold the grappler in place, 

the grappler is broken, and thus unusable

Looks horrible, works. I did 720x1920. It gives more FOV at the sides instead of top and bottom. 

I can prove this. When you do horizontal stretched res, the sides are cut. Therefore, the game tries to fill it. When the sides are cut, the aspect ratio. If you fit in a 16:9 square into a horizontal stretched res before the actual stretching, you will see that there is space up and down.So, you see more things, up and down. 

However, with vertical stretched res, the top and bottom are cut. Therefore, when you fit a 16:9 square, you see more at the sides.

Arguably, seeing more at the sides is better. You can see more from peeking corners, spot more enemies (because the map is usually flat) and generally have better awareness.

If you do want to try this, try a milder res. Like 900x1920. 720x1920 made me nauseous and gave me a headache for the better part of a day.

They're playing the game on a good PC, without a care in the world. They're probably enjoying Arena, even if they would be better off without hamster balls. I respect actual competitive people. 

Now, onto the list:

What they say:

Give me siphon back in pubs!

What they mean:

I want to carelessly pubstomp bots without carrying shields and healing

What they say:

Arena isn't a solution, because PC players have 500fps and I only have 60 on console!

What they mean:

I don't want to play against players that **might** have an advantage over me, because all I care about is 20+ kill games and it should be easy. Also, I want to be competitive but can't be arsed to invest in competitive materials. I want to win money, but not pay the entrance fee.

What they say:

Heavy Sniper is too powerful, a bodyshot shouldn't deal 150 damage and one shot me.

What they mean:

Only shotguns should be viable, because I can't wall floor ramp a sniper and I don't like to be confronted with the fact my situational awareness is shit.

What they say:

If you don't like siphon, you're a bot and you should get better.

What they mean:

Please don't get better, I want 20 bombs and I want them to be easy. 

What they say:

Siphon helps casuals as well, you should want it back too!

What they mean:

I want to shit on casuals, I know siphon doesn't do shit for them, but it's free shields for me and I don't have to farm as much.

What they say:

We want ranked, skill based matchmaking.

What they mean:

We want the lobby to be significantly worse than we are, preferably with some disadvantage, like touch controls or lower FPS than I have. 

What they say: 

Nerf L2 spam and aim assist on a controller, it's unfair!

What they mean:

I want to be able to hit headshots all day, but I sure as hell don't want my opponents to hit me back.

*****Bonus:***** 

Some funny observations:

- If a Switch player complains about bad performance and being paired with Ps4 players, he's a bot and should buy a real console. If PS4 players get paired with PC, Epic should do something about it.

- If someone shits on a ""competitive"" player, he's OBVIOUSLY using mouse and keyboard in a console lobby. 

- Xbox players are bots, ever since they got grouped with PS4, lobbies have been really easy. - PS4 players

- PS4 players are bots, ever since they got grouped with Xbox, lobbies have been really easy - Xbox players.

- Ever since season 8 started, lobbies have become **so sweaty** and it's impossible to win. - Xbox and PS4 players.

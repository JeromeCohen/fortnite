1,Jack-o-banter,1506834503,73jvwr,42,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/73jvwr/this_game_is_shit/,0,This game is shit.,"Fortnite on PC is garbage.  I spent an hour giving this game the benefit of the doubt, and here's my experience.  30 minutes were spent in a lobby with friends, experiencing a non-descript error.  It wouldn't let us into a game.  

Eventually it gave us a queue screen that rose and fell like a roller coaster.  1500 ahead of us, 200 ahead of us.  455 ahead of us, 77 ahead of us.  Then back to 1500. 

Eventually we got into the game.  I'm sure the game played out wonderfully, but a couple minutes in I received an ""Unreal Engine Error"" and the game crashed.  

Cue up another 10 minutes of matchmaking, and the same error occurs!  This time it was during the pre-game free for all.

That was the last straw for me. 

This game sounds amazing on paper.  I'm sure there's some epic CEOs congratulating themselves on hitting some gameplay bullet points... But the experience I've had tonight is enough to have me warn everyone I know away from this game. ",FortNiteBR

Last 3 players, and I was about to go towards the safezone, then I fell in a cliff that has a small cliff (the ones we use in the beginning to land faster). I didn't have enough materials to climb back up, and the little cliff wasn't on the next circle. So I thought there is no hope to win this. I started unloading my sniper rifle. My racket attracted the other player, and i was able to take him down. Most of his loot fell(slope), but I was able to grab his stone materials. Was able to climb back up where the last guy was waiting for me. He was a bit of a potato with the shotgun, took him down and I won with a total of 9 kills.
It was a crazy scenario, and I just had to share. Too bad I wasn't able to record it.",FortNiteBR

- Games last too short, half of the population is dead within 4 or 5 minutes. Probably due to the map's size.

-  Some buildings such as houses and sheds seem like they're just copied and pasted accross the map.

- Some weapons such as the SMG and semi auto sniper are useless in that they lack damage and/or magazine size.

- Lack of weapon variety, a bow or something similar would be nice.

- One map. Hopefully that'll change soon.",FortNiteBR

- **No freelook**: the fact that you can sneak up on people (specially in a game that emphasises at the moment closer-quarters combat) and know they haven't seen you is a big thing. I am pleased to know this isn't a thing.

- **No proning**: proning wouldn't bring anything to this game. There's not enough cover / blending with the environment for this to be good, and this would only increase 3rd personing in low walls, which isn't fun. Proning is a passive move and it has no place in a faster paced game like this.

- **No auto-pickup**: although I agree that the looting system needs some love, I do like the fact that you have to make yourself vulnerable to pick up look (by pulling out your pickaxe, making you look downwards and not being able to return fire immediately).

  Unfortunately, they'll be removing this soon (next patch?) but I really really hope that they develop a mechanism where looting is a risk again. Oh, and good luck when your 4-squad is crammed into a 1x1 building and you're trying to share ammo!

- **No ammo overflow**: this is particularly great about this game. In other games, ammo is too plentiful. They've now added more ammo but not enough ammo to have 300 rounds of an AR, unless you're already killing +10 people in a match (and even so, I only get to the mid 100's). 

  This is good: this forces you to play with other weapons and change your strategy, and makes the survival part of the game more interesting. Too much ammo makes ammo not important, but an afterthought. Specially in squads!

- **No vehicles**: This is a tough topic and I am sure that great minds at Epic are working towards a good solution, not a tacked-on one. Although it sucks to be overwhelmed by the circle, circle management is an important aspect of a BR game. The map is small enough and characters run fast enough (and you can climb mountains with wooded bridges!) for this not to be a problem.

  If you've played H1Z1 you will know that vehicles at the end of a match are a nightmare. It's about who has the vehicle who wins (and lord don't get me started on leaving a vehicle at 90kph and shoot someone in the head unscathed), making vehicles too valuable.

- **No storm camping**: this is a fantastic design decision by Epic. Blurring the vision inside the storm and not being able to see from the storm into the play area is fantastic. This is what should make you _fear_ the storm. This is a big problem in games like PUBG (which links back to my ""no no no vehicles"" point).

- **No looking around when downed**: this is also great. Getting your teammates back up should be a risk vs. reward situation. Being forced to look at them forces you to be very aware of your surroundings and makes downing a player a real disadvantage (specially in close quarters). This makes being aggressive rewarding since you're reducing the chance of returning fire when flanking.

This is overall a great game and a breath of fresh air, and I hope Epic continues to provide these small, but important distinctions that will separate it from other BR games.",FortNiteBR

Personally i like the looting system how it is currently. No silly menu screen that you have to look at while it blocks your screen, you can carefully maneuver your way around the colourful loot while still being on the look out for anybody trying to sneak up on you.

Like I'm sure you've seen various times already, the only problem is trying to pick up certain weapons that are literally inside other weapons or slot items like bandages and sheild potions. I actually want this looting system to stay so my only solution to this is that when a player dies the loot just spreads out more, or at least the weapons are designed to be spread out further away from each other. This way after running through the pile with your pickaxe to grab all ammo and resources, you're just left with a nice spread out piles of weapons to easily swap out.

Also just a little side note. I hope they bring pickaxe skins and keep the system of whipping it out to collect all loot. This way, in the hopeful future, you have more of a reason to show off your cool pickaxe skin. ",FortNiteBR

Overpowered :
Scoped assault rifle

Good weapons:
Bolt action, Semi-auto shotgun, AR (post patch), burst AR

Utility weapons:
Rocket launcher &gt; grenade launcher &gt; grenades.
Revolver (sometimes)

B tier weapons:
pistols, pump shotgun

Bad/Underpowered weapons:
Semi auto sniper, SMG

---

Explanations: 

Scoped rifle is OP. No/little recoil, pinpoint accuracy, hitscan. Almost certainly needs some bullet travel time. Best gun in the game without question

Semi auto sniper sucks for its rarity. Bullet speeds for the snipers are really slow in this game and having to hit 3+ in a row to kill someone (compared to 1 shot for a sniper a lot of the time, or a hitscan scoped AR). Also eats your ammo like crazy.
Half of the time crouching and shooting with the regular AR's is better

SMG's are *really* bad. The damage is WAY too low. Accuracy is even worse than AR's. Clip size + low damage means you can rarely kill in one clip = bad. Would be cool if moving shots with it was its speciality but right now other common guns better at all ranges

Pistols are fine. They aren't supposed to be that good. The revolver is cool and has some niche use early on since it does a lot of damage and is fairly accurate for single shots.
Pump shotgun is fine. Semi auto is the upgrade",FortNiteBR

This one game just pushed me over the edge on weapons rng.

Last 3.
 I see one with my sniper, ping him. Boom. Oh wait hes fully shielded. He survives. I stay calm and wait. The 3rd player is dispatched by this guy so i know his area and hes not shielded.

He builds a fort to confirm this and i proceed to flank.

Now i have 200hp with full shield. 90 bullets in my trusty rng cannon of burst rifle. Grey so its gonna be a lottery.

I run the hill and boom he appears. 1 on 1. 95hp v 200. Hes using assault. Immediately i get first hit. Burst. 27 damage 1 of 3 bullets hits him. Now he taps me 5 times with tapfire. Hit hit hit. As my 2nd and 3rd bursts magically miss him, im at around 90 hp then insta die. Headshot.

2nd place because of this games bloom effect. 

This shouldnt be happening. I was effectiv3ly 2 people, i hit first and all 3 hits were dead on his body.

Final piece to add. I was crouched and immobil3. He was standing and running.

PUBG has a formula based on kills (rewarding kills in top 10 more) and placement (highly emphasizing top 10/top 5 finishes). 

In H1, your rank does not go down if you perform poorly in later matches. This does have the effect that you can (to an extent) grind out matches to get a higher rank without improving your play (just from RNG), but good players will still have an advantage since they're winning and killing more often and have more chances to score those high kill wins compared to someone who rarely wins. 

In PUBG, your rating is dynamic, which is nice because it rewards consistency and a dip in performance will cause your rank to go down. However, it has a toxic effect which I believe outweighs the positives - at higher ranks, you will lose a massive amount of standing from dying early. A top 70 finish just from a poor early game start will hurt you a lot, and a string of unlucky early games will tank your rating. This has the effect that high-ranked players will often engage in incredibly conservative gameplay to ensure they get into the top 10 and protect their rank. This system works decently in PUBG, but only because the game is designed to have slower core gameplay that emphasizes careful play and tactical positioning, so the rank system lines up with the gameplay nicely.

Right now, Fortnite is incredibly fun for me because it's an absolute warzone. People are scrapping left and right. I've had games where my duo and I fight off 5+ squads one after the other, coming in like waves in a zombies game. In solos, I find myself jumping into crossfires and having heated battles in the top 20, going from a kill to immediately starting another firefight. The game is great because it rewards this high level of action, and I think that given the rest of the arcadey game design, a ranked system that encourages aggression and doesn't over-penalize early deaths is optimal for the game. I don't want leaderboards to arrive and for all my games to turn into campfests where everyone is too scared to fight. Being passive isn't an illegitimate playstyle, but the way the game is designed, I don't think it should be rewarded in the rankings. 

TL;DR: Don't punish high-ranking players immensely for dying early and not winning 35% of the games they play like PUBG does. Leaderboards don't have to copy H1's top 10 style, but they should encourage the frenzy we've had so far since BR went F2P. Put the ""battle"" in Battle Royale. ",FortNiteBR

In this game, you have no idea if the fight you're about to take is vs someone with a full 100 shield. There needs to be indication that you/enemies are shielded, perhaps a small blue aura around your character?

The other problem is bandages/healing to full. I feel like with how arcadey/fast paced Fortnite is, we should spawn in with 5 bandages to get us started. Nothing is more irritating then landing in a populated area, getting 3-5 kills, but die to someone instantly because you're &lt;20hp and couldn't find bandgaes.

Last, why only heal to 75%? I understand it in PUBG, but this game has no helmets, and I often find myself without shield/medkit and only bandages, and then I just get 1-tapped in the head by an AR or bodyshot by a sniper. If they let us heal to 100% with bandages it wouldn't render medkits useless, because it still heals you for far more; faster.

TL;DR:

* Show some sort of indication enemies have shields.
* Put shields in airdrop crates only. Spawning them in the world makes fights even more RNG than they need to be.
* Spawn us in with 5 bandages to keep the fast pace of the game respected. Hell, even let us craft them.
* Healing to 75 (with bandages) is problematic when there are no helmets and you can just get one-tapped.",FortNiteBR

It has come to my attention that communication is paramount in this game, especially whilst playing Squads (and the upcoming Duos).
There is no way to talk to our teammates. What if one of us needs bullets or is low health and needs medkits?

So, in order to prevent this, we need a solution. Whilst voice chat is coming, some people don't have a mic. My idea - an emote wheel filled with heaps of phrases and words that are important in a game. Some of these phrases could be -

*I need bandages!

*I need a medkit!

*I need bullets!

*I need a gun!

*Build here!

*Destroy this!

*I am under attack!

*Thanks!

*Hello!

*Group up at (your selected beacon).

*Run!

*Regroup!

*Be careful!

*Stay here!

*Wait for me!

*What a ~~save~~ shot!

*Yes

*No

*Loot here!

There are some MAJOR issues with the keyboard and mouse on the PS4, here are the ones I discovered after just one game.

- No mouse cursor on menu screens and inventory, making it nearly impossible to find and click on anything.

- Players have no ability to change their mouse sensitivity! This is making it impossible for most players to even try the game with a keyboard/mouse. I have a dpi button that allowed me to change it in major increments but I couldn't change it through the game or PS4 at all!

- HUGE fps drops. I have no clue why this happens, and it doesn't seem to happen to people using controllers, but I almost never got over 30fps when using the keyboard and mouse and it got even worse when I got in a gunfight, in which case my fps dropped into the 10fps area and I couldn't see a thing until I died.

- One of the minor issues I noticed is that my scroll wheel was much less responsive on console, not sure why that is, but it wasn't a huge deal.

*small add on, I couldn't tell if there was aim assist like on the controller when using a mouse/keyboard, but if there is I would definitely recommend reducing or even completely removing it like it is on PC, if there's aim assist for players with a mouse they will win a majority of the gunfights.*

Fix these few but MAJOR problems and you've got yourself a great game on every platform!

Coming from H1Z1 and PUBG i wanted to discuss some of the game mechanics in Fortnite compared the two other popular BR games. Feel free to join in, and share your views.   
   
&amp;nbsp;
   
**Free-look**   
When i first jumped into this game, i thought (having played a fair amount of H1Z1KOTK and PUBG): ""wtf, you can't free look? hopefully they add that soon"", but after playing as much as my free time allowed me the past two days, i figured that it's actually quite refreshing to be able to see if your opponents is actually looking in your direction. I feel like not having free look in this game works pretty well around how the ranged accuracy on most of the guns work and the fact that you have to run some good distances because of the lack of vehicles.   
What i mean by this, is that if you don't have a sniper, you often times need to get closer to your target before engaging a fight. People are running alot in order to get to the safe zone, so sometimes you will have to chase for quite a distance, and i think it feels pretty good to know that if you didn't see your opponent turn around, there is a good chance he didn't spot you, and won't be waiting for you around the next corner with a shotgun.   
   
**Bloom/Weapon accuracy**   
It might be just my muscle memory in gun fights comming from h1z1 (standing, strafing while ADS) that hinders me when trying to shoot medium/long range with AR's, but i feel that the accuracy of the AR's at needs some kind of tuning in terms of accuracy. Dunno if this needs to just be 1st bullet accuracy or less overall bloom.   
Other than that, i honestly think that bloom fits this game quite well compared to eg. h1z1. There are more different weapon types and tiers within, and also a lot more ways to play out a fight (building), that let's you play around the fact that your gun may be worse at range than your opponents.   
   
**Vehicles**   
I don't think that cars should have a place in this game given the map size and how the terrain is build. Maybe in the future, something like a hoverboard (as another post pointed out yesterday) could be cool, as it would let you move slightly faster on flat-ish terrain and water, while not providing the cover a car does.   
   
**Un-unloadable weapons**   
I don't know if this is something that EG plans on changing or not, and i don't quite know how i feel about it. It does kinda suck to pick up an empty grey AR from a dead guy, reload it with ammo from your backpack, and then 1 minute later find a higher tiered AR and thus having to drop your grey AR and the 30 bullets you just loaded into it.   
On the other hand, i quite like the mechanic of finding spawned weapons loaded and ready to fire at pick-up, and while i like the fact that there is no limitation on the ammo you can carry, i dont think that this mechanic would work very well, if you were able to pick up spawned low-tier weapons and unload all the 30 bullets to your backpack and drop the gun.   
Therefore it's a trade-of and i honestly like EG's approach so far.   

&amp;nbsp;
   
I had some more thoughts, but i don't have time right now to write them up, so please let me know what you guys think about the game mechanics and why.   
   
&amp;nbsp;
   
EDIT:   
**Wall spamming**   
I played Squad game yesterday and we were fighting another squad. This one guy from the enemy squad got isolated from his team quite close to us, and we were trying to knock him down. While all 3 of us were firing at him with all we had, he just kept spamming mouse 1 to instantly build a new wall once we destroyed one. At some point his team-mates got our attention and he was able to build a small ""base"" and we only got him when one of my mates were able to throw a grenade on him.   
I think this needs to be adjusted, so you cannot build a new wall in the excact same spot instantly after one was destroyed. The reload time doesn't have to be more than a second or so, but if there is no down time, you can stay in cover for quite a while with 999 wood.   
It might not be as strong a strat in solos given that your situation is not changing much, but in Squad, you can buy your teammates so much time with this.

Also, depending where the 3rd person camera is panned, your own footsteps will pan from the left or right which is VERY disorienting. Again, it always sounds like someone is closely walking near you instead of your own footsteps. The gun audio is also a little wonky at times, where your own gun sounds like a cannon going off in your ear. Meanwhile, gun battles between other players might sound close by  but trying to geolocate them based off of sound will prove that they are nowhere near you.

Anyways I mostly play csgo, so I'm trying to learn the game, what should I do, what should I not do and thought I'm gonna share my experience( mostly 'cause I'm bored) :)
(After playing for like 3-4 hours and only getting to 2nd place a few times I thought about what did I do wrong and how what should I do about it, now I win most of the matches because I always have a plan in mind)

1. Just a few simple tricks:

- To only loot ammo, have your picaxe out and spam E
- If you just started, don't think about winning first, jump out at the beginning and practise shooting, try out as many guns as you can and choose which one suits you the best
- Farming building gives you little resources, farm trees/rocks/vehicles
-Don't take fights which does not benefit you, you're just gonna loose your shield or your hp.
- Always reload your guns, You don't wanna start a fight by reloading and getting hit because of the time you lost :(
- Learn this: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/730aan/for_those_of_you_that_dont_know_the_quality_order/

2. Winning a game:

A) Early game:

- Jump down to a place which has several houses to loot and loot quick
- You should have a weapon for close range and one for long range(rifle/sniper)
- If you have some basic weapons+meds get away from the houses quick

B) Mid game:

- Farm wood(around 300-400), stone/metal (200-300 each)
- Always check your surroundings, be ready to put down walls if someone starts taking shots at you
- After playing a few matches you're gonna know the basic spawn points of crates that others might not know of(like in trucks on the roads)
- The dream loadout imo: Some kind of sniper + rifle(Scar) + Shotgun + Rocket Launcher + shield/medkit/bandages
- If you have the above be stealthy, don't take fights which would not benefit you
- If you don't have the ""dream loadout"" you have to think about killing some people, but don't take any risky fights. If you are low on ammo, winning game is really hard, you have to kill some people to get ammo for End game

C) End game:

- Check the map and you have 2 choices: Go to the middle and build a base(that's my way) OR stay near the wall and wait for others to kill each other and be stealthy.
- Check the people around you and don't waste ammo if you're low on it. Let people fight and only engage if you know you have a chance of taking them out.
- If the circle is small, wait for the last 15-20sec to move, if you are not in the circle. Wait for others to push in and try not letting them build a base there or even better kill them. If you are fighting against someone in a base, it's a huge advantage to have a rocket launcher and to blow up their base and then kill them with a rifle or if you have granade launcher try shooting it into their base which will kill them, also rocket/granade launcher is perfect if the enemy is behind a tree.

Last, but not least: Enjoy the game and if you are in the last 10, but you die, check out how they play, learn from them and also think about why you died so that in the next match you're not gonna do the same mistake. :)
(I'm still learning how to get better, if you have any tips feel free to share it) :)",FortNiteBR

But, unless you're a dense toilet paper roll, it's pretty easy to understand and the concept is simple: Be the last player/team alive. 

So far, I've seen people say that the bloom is too much, I've seen people say that the building mechanic is useless, I've seen people say that the gameplay is too slow, I've seen people say that ammo is too scarce; and to the average eye that may be true. But I've been playing the game almost nonstop the past 24 hours and I've noticed a few contrasts to a majority of people's complaints and problems with the game that I felt necessary to share with you all today. Some may be obvious, but some you may find surprising, but all in all, I hope this helps:

1. When parachuting onto the map, try to land on top of a building and mine downwards. This way, you can hit any secret chests that may be hidden in the attic of houses, or the top floor of buildings and get better loot drops and potentially shields earlier off in the game. 

2. In the center of the E3 block of the map, there's a tunnel that leads to the pizzeria. On the wall opposite of the utility room in the tunnel, there is a secret room near the middle of the tunnel that can potentially reveal 2 chests sitting on tables. This is a great spot to land if you want a full inventory, fast. 

3. There will ALWAYS be an ammo box underneath the staircases in every house. This does not apply to staircases in office buildings as they might not have ammo boxes underneath their staircases. 

4. AMMO BOXES ARE EVERYWHERE. Literally. They're everywhere. I've ended numerous games with close to 200 rounds for my AR, 150 rounds for my SMG and Pistol, 11 Rockets, and 9 grenades, and at least 20 shotgun rounds. But, nobody really looks for them or finds them because, aside from not knowing about them at all, most of the time they're hidden well and dark in color. For example: barns with hay, one might be in a dimly lit area of the barn behind a couple haystacks where no one will find it unless they're looking for it.

5. BUILDING is very useful in the later portion of the game (around 20-10 players left) when the storm closes in on a small area. I've found it's best to try and predict the next storm circle by building a small base or cover spot where you think the storm circle might appear. Building is also very useful to explore parts of the map you can't get to, and getting down from higher up areas. 

6. HOW TO DEAL WITH BLOOM: Ugh. Why is this even a thing? Anyway, to counteract the effect your bloom has on your aim (for those of you who don't know what bloom is: think of a flower blooming, it's pedals spread in all directions. And in this game, so does your bullets.): CROUCH. Crouching greatly reduces the effect of bloom. And also, STOP MOVING. Just like in any shooter game, your accuracy is reduced by movement; and also, burst fire your weapons, but that should be obvious in a long range game. So try to crouch, and sit still when shooting, and burst fire for optimal accuracy

7. ITEM RARITY. Gold is better than Purple, Purple is better than Blue, Blue is better than Green, and Green is better than Grey. By ""better"" I mean: the rarity of the gun dictates DPS, critical damage, bloom spread, basically overall accuracy and damage of the weapon gets better the rarer an item is. 

8. Most LEGENDARY WEAPONS have set spawn locations, and it depends on RNG whether or not those weapons with spawn there, but they also can be found near chests, and in the chests. I've found the legendary SCAR in the utility room mentioned above, and legendary snipers in certain watch towers. 

9. AIM FOR THE HEAD. This one should be obvious. Headshots deal more damage, faster. Headshots with shotguns deal around 160 damage. That's enough to kill someone, or if they have full shields, to 40 health w/ no shield. Seriously, headshots are crucial. 

If anyone else has anything they'd like to add to make up for a part of the game I missed, feel free to. Happy hunting.

Recently, Fortnite Battle Royale has released as a Free-to-Play game mode. Many people have expressed concern and are upset about the decision to split into 2 subreddits. We hope this statement will address your concerns and answer some of the questions and rumors that have been going around. The mod team here has been silent on the subject as we wanted to prepare a proper statement that was clear and concise. We wished to have gotten this statement out sooner, so we apologize for being quiet and late on the matter.
_________

Shortly before Fortnite Battle Royale was announced ([See original announcement here on September 12, 2017](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/announcing-fortnite-battle-royale) ), Epic approached the /r/Paragon mod team and the /r/Fortnite mod team and mentioned they were working on a Battle Royale mode. While we did not get the details of the mode at the time, here is what we learned:

* The game mode was being developed by a separate development team at Epic Games.

* The mode was distinct enough from ""Save the World"" that it warranted its own space.

* Both modes are the same game at heart and they want players to play both modes.

* There never was any official mandate to split the content. One of their suggestions was to have a separate subreddit

* When it comes down to it, the reason for notifying us was to let us know they would be ok if we split the content, **if we chose to do so** because Epic themselves confirmed the game modes were different enough to warrant it.

_________

##**Subreddit Creation**

Originally, the Battle Royale subreddit was named /r/FNBattleRoyale. **It was originally created by Epic as they were looking to reserve the name for the Reddit community for later use.** When they approached us, they handed this sub over to us (Note: /r/FortniteBR creation is further down). 

As Battle Royale was officially announced, we realized that yes, this game mode is very different than Save the World. The /r/Paragon mods and /r/Fortnite mods reviewed what Epic had originally told us about the 2 game modes. We were trying to figure out the best way to handle the new content.

We all knew that there are many gamers who love the PVP aspects of any game they play, and some may not care for PVE aspects. We weighed the pros and cons of keeping 1 sub or splitting them up.

**Pros**

* Easier for players to talk about the content they wish and find the content they wish

* Because there are 2 separate dev teams, it would make it easier for them to communicate with their specific player base and receive feedback. (Currently right now, we have devs active in both subs).

* Allows promotion of more player-specific content

**Cons**

* 2 Subs - it can be an annoyance for people to have to jump back and forth

* New players may get confused and would have to be redirected to the respective sub and it may cause confusion for some people who are unsure if the modes are really the same game.

* It would split the playerbase

There are of course more pros and cons not mentioned, but those are some of the big ones.
______

Battle Royale was then officially released as part of Fortnite's Early Access (You had to purchase a founders package to play). We were able to get so much more information for ourselves about how the game mode runs and works, and we were now able to see what exactly Epic meant when they stated these game modes were two different beings. Ultimately, we decided to follow through with the creation of the new subreddit. We created the new sub /r/FortniteBR as we felt it was a better name for the subreddit as a whole **The endorsement of Epic letting us know it was two distinctively different modes and dev teams** and the new community PVP would bring to Fortnite led to the final decision to split the subs.

All the mods felt this would be the best approach to handle the situation.

##**Where do we go from here?**

We felt we made the best decision possible when officially splitting up the subreddits. We have seen advocates from both sides of the equation with good arguments on whether the communities should be split or together.

We are currently evaluating all options at this time. We do not want to make any further changes until we are able to see what both subs will look like with the influx of new players now that [Battle Royale is officially Free-to-Play](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-goes-free). **For the time being, we will remain as two separate subs because of the clear distinction in conversation. We will remain this way until it becomes clear that two communities are more harmful than helpful.**

Again, we hope this clears up any sort of confusion and look forward to a healthy discussion on the matter.

*Yes. We will have Leaderboards and Rankings. Regarding stats, we’re already recording a lot of player data and hope to have it visible in game soon.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**I want to drive around. Where are the vehicles?**   
*Right now we do not have any immediate plans to add vehicles. We’ve done some very early prototypes internally, but have concerns with how they’ll affect the flow of Battle Royale.  We’ll let you know our plans when we have a better understanding of their impact.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Will you add more maps?**  
*Yes, but not right away. We’ll also be looking into improving our current map, including adding more points of interest.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**What else are you working to immediately improve or add?**  
*We’re working to improve the feel of combat, controls, weapons, and movement. We’re also working to streamline inventory management, decrease time spent waiting in the lobby, and improve bus timing (so choosing when to jump has more strategy)*  
&amp;nbsp;  
*Find out more information [on what’s coming here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battle-royale/royale-with-cheese/68470-fortnite-battle-royale-state-of-development)*.  
&amp;nbsp;  
#GENERAL QUESTIONS   
**Why did Epic make only Battle Royale free?  When will the whole game be free?**  
*We still have a lot of features to add before the PvE campaign is complete. We will launch the Save the World PvE campaign for free in 2018.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Now that Battle Royale is free, does that mean that PvP development is complete?**  
*No. Fortnite is still in development and we will continue to improve and expand both the PvE and PvP game modes.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Does Battle Royale mean that Fortnite is abandoning PvE?**  
*No. The team has big plans and is continuing to add features and develop new modes to play, including the previously announced “Block Party” mode. Stay tuned for some spooky details on our October updates soon.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Will my progress in Fortnite PvE campaign transfer over into Battle Royale?**  
*For now, PvE and PvP are not connected and we don’t know if Battle Royale will eventually connect to the Fortnite Campaign. We are considering cosmetic connections between PvE and PvP and compendium-like content, but we’re still figuring it out. Let us know what you think would be cool.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Will Fortnite Battle Royale be pay-to-win?**  
*No. We will not sell items that give a competitive advantage. At some point in the future we will sell other things including cosmetics or compendium-like content.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
We encourage your questions! We'll do our best to provide answers.

I thought it was okay, but didn't gave it much thought after that and didn't buy it for myself.

My expectations were, too be honest, really low since this IS a F2P game but damn!  

This is actually very good! Not crappy at all!

I think that this game would benefit, *GREATLY*, by having a system in place that rewards people for not only playing, but also for doing well. 


**Leveling/Ranking Format:**

* Exp per kill, and per win - Giving players exp per kill and per win, as well as a small amount per game played, would incentivize players to keep coming back, past the allure of the gameplay itself. 

* Emblems/Markers - Having an emblem or marker that players can sport in game next to their name, that shows up when killing them/being killed by them, for ever 5 levels.

* Cosmetics - Every 10/25 levels, give people a cosmetic that is specific to that rank/level. This will further give folks a nice little carrot to chase, so they can show off their efforts on their character as well.



After playing 40ish games so far since F2P launch, these are some ideas that came to me, that seemed like nice little bonuses/incentives to keep people playing, and striving to get better. If you have any other suggestions for a system like this, feel free to share!",FortNiteBR

That said, I place top ten most games, and win my more than my fair share. So, let's get to the tips that I haven't seen shared elsewhere.

* When skydiving, it's best if you jump slightly before your LZ, and dive almost directly down. This is because your umbrella will deploy while your still rather high, so you can glide almost horizontally to your chosen LZ. Helps beat those who have picked the same location as you to that first weapon.

* Learn the terrain and find the best spots to land. Sure, there's some really good loot to be found in the high density areas, but everyone else knows that too, so you'll end up fighting 20+ people to the death for it. There's some great, lesser known spots that offer great loot (like the tunnel &amp; fast food area in the north-east of the map) and once your armed, you can ambush the winner of that 20+ deathmatch, and they'll have hoovered all that great loot for you.

* Further to that point, use the terrain! The map is very hilly, make this an advantage. So many people run along the crest of a hill, getting a great vista of everything around them - and begging to be sniped. Use the natural defilades to shield yourself from being spotted and sniped.

*  Crouch! The amount of times I catch someone sprinting into a building is bananas. It offers loads of advantages; you'll be more accurate, you'll be harder to hit, and the guy your stalking is less likely to hear you. Your sprint-crouch is faster than walking, so there's no reason not to.

* Building is essential! At first building can seem a bit difficult and pointless, but when you get to that last 20 enemies in a small area, a good fort confers a major advantage. Build up to offer a height advantage, just be wary of building sky forts as a few shots to the foundations can often bring the whole thing down.

* Inventory management is essential. On PS4 you can click the touchpad and re-arrange your inventory. I find it best to have an assault rifle first, followed by the rest of my weapons, grenades and finally med-kits. This helps when you need to switch weapons on the fly, just be sure to do this in a secluded area as your vulnerable while your in the menus. 

* When looting, switching to your pickaxe means you can spam square and pick up all the ammo and resources without switching weapons. If you do this first, it's means you won't be struggling to catch that shiny orange weapon that's caught your eye, as there will be less clutter on the ground.

* While the best weapon for you is personal preference, some should never be passed up. Snipers should always be picked up, as you can OSK with a headshot on anyone without full shielding. Grenades and launchers are very useful for flushing cover, and are vital in the final melee. Finally, scoped rifles are an absolute blessing, as they are majorly accurate and don't suffer from the current random nature of the other weapons. Never, never, pass a scoped rifle up.

* I expect this tip to become redundant eventually which is why I left it to last, but currently you cannot switch shoulders. This means in a fire fight the person who pushes right will always have the first shot advantage. Use this (slightly unfair) tactic to your advantage during CQB and you'll win more often than not.

That's all I've got for now, I'd love for other's to share their tips, especially if they are slightly less obvious. I have a lot of enthusiasm about this game, and wish you all luck in the Battle Royale!

&amp;nbsp;

- To pick up ammo, traps and stackable items bring out your Pick axe, this will stop you from swapping weapons. Note: This works because the pick axe cannot be swapped, this means **it will only work** when your inventory slots are already full!

&amp;nbsp;

- When knocking down walls or trees or what have you, aim your reticle at the glowing blue spots for double damage.

&amp;nbsp;

- When using the glider, pushing forward seems to be faster than just falling down. (untested, just a hunch)

&amp;nbsp;

-  If you fly left or right rather than forward or backward, you travel faster. Best used when going the distance!

The difference between PUBG and Fortnite is the building mechanic, but the circle will shrink so fast you dont really have time to scavenge and create anything for yourself. I've been lucky more often then not and am often inside it's shrinkage, but regardless it seems like a problem. The map being big is pointless because 3 minutes in more than half of it is off limits and a short minute later 70% are dead and do not survive that long sprint to the eye. Aside from being in the last 10 alive, **most** never really build anything short of building a quick wall if you're getting shot at.I think if they get rid of the storm in favor of another mechanic or at least make it shrink slower/wider in order to give people the incentive to build and scavenge and **outsmart** your enemy rather than most of the time making a dead sprint for the eye of the storm; then the game would be amazing, and would definitely warrant people playing it over PUBG.

I'd say whenever you kill another player they should drop 1x fifteen healing health kit. Maybe 2x would be even better . Just add that to everyones loot spew when they die, it would improve the game. ",FortNiteBR

""What if I just build a staircase that just goes up, and up, and up until it cannot go any further, and then I just build a platform up there, following the eye of the storm?""

4 tries and 1000 wood (thank you Wailing Woods) later, I managed to accomplish it and what do you know? I acctually won since the second place ""Got lost in the storm"" when the size of the eye of the storm was just a mans width or so (guess it was on a slope on the ground).

So I acctually managed to win Fortnite BR without firing a single shot or damaging another player!

Maybe there could be a system where you can upgrade the rarity of a gun at the cost of steel? 
While I'm here I might as well mention, the UI is terrible. As of now, theres no point to an inventory screen. Just show us a counter for all the ammo types on the HUD and add a button that lets us drop our currently held object. Easy and fast.

On my PC with an i7 and a 980ti I can't get above 40FPS no matter what. Fortnite however, I am always at 60 or above - literally a day after it's release it already runs so much better. 


The gameplay itself is so much more enjoyable. It seems so much more fun to play than PUBG. The building aspect of the game is incredible. Like today, I survived up until I was the 2nd person left alive by building a shack in the center of the circle and creating windows, shooting from them then blocking them back up. My safehouse was taken out by an RPG which killed me. This scenario is something PUBG players could only dream of in their game but as I said earlier, we are on the second day of this game's release and it already contains so many more features and fun little functions that just enhance the experience greatly.


This game is great. Download it, play it, enjoy it.


EDIT: really rustled some PUBG fans Jim jams with this one. I'm not saying ""fuck PUBG, fuck the fans, fuck everybody"" I'm literally saying that the current state of Fortnite, its performance and the mechanics available are both more playable and fun than PUBGs are CURRENTLY. I'm sure in a year or so PUBG will be everything anyone imagined from a BR game but in its current state it is an undeniable mess with development taking far too long for the simplest bug fixes and performance improvements.

With that said, the bloom is a tad too much. I normally am 100% against bloom in any shooter, but Fortnite could make it work on spamming M1, but if you tap/pace your shots the first-shot accuracy kicks in so you can get reliable headshots.

3. Possibly implement an over the shoulder look.

4.make loot drop in a bag/box or something else other then scattered, it consumes huge amount of time trying to go through loot on the ground.

5. increase inventory slots with back pack or holdle and have various sizes. 


6. Decrease diving speed, it currently out paces the bus and there for it's harder to determine if somone has dropped in your spot before you get there.

7. Increase map size and add a viechle, even if just a bicycle. 

8. Char customisation.

That's just some of my ideas nothing out of the ordinary but think it could benefit from these changes. Fantastic game and can't wait for the future releases.

I played a few matches and did ok, but got wrecked a few times too...then this match happened.

I found myself in a barn, holding out to see where the death circle would move when I heard an enemy enter the barn. He ran towards me shooting wildly and I was able to put him to rest barely. Interestingly, he actually had a rocket launcher on him so I took that. He sent me a message saying good luck and hoped I did well(I figured it was a salty message) but the guy sas genuinely nice. At this point, there is roughly 50 people left.

I move towards a mountain area and wait for people to die off. There is about 10 people now, so it starts getting intense, I get in a gunfight, and am able to survive with 20% health but no medkits, someone else killed the guy I was shooting at. 

I find myself with my back against a wall, basically hyperventalating(definitely spelled wrong) and there is only 3 people left. I see one guy poke his head around the corner, I panic and shoot and kill him, thankfully I don't think he saw me. Now, it's me and one other guy.

I hear him putting up a barricade and decide I have to investigate regardless of my low life. I take a couple assault rifle shots at him but he sees me and runs around the corner. That's when I had a genuine moment oh ahah, I pulled out the rocket launcher and took the one shot I had  around the corner killing him for the win!

This may have been longer than I meant but I genuinely love this game, so thank you to both the devs and the great community so far.",FortNiteBR

The game runs very smooth, dynamic combat makes it so enjoyable, its just extremely fun to play without a doubt, especially for a f2p game. However there is a couple of things I would love to be added asap. -

1. Make adjusting settings in-game possible.

2. Give players the option to change the Aim down sensitivity and scoping. 

3. Create a rewarding system as even though the game is great fun, there is no rewards for winning (I know that is not going to take a few hours to make but would be great to know if you guys are working on something like this)

4. I don't see vehicles in this game, my opinion is that cars would not fit in. HOWEVER I do think that when you have to run a long distance, a motorbike like the one they had in the movie TRON would look well in-game (perhaps with extra 2 seater for a full 4 squad).

5. Although the combat is dynamic I feel like some parts of the map are not being used, perhaps make lobbies bigger? 

6. Make characters customizable, no skins etc. at first but I noticed there is a few models of characters that you get to play randomly when starting a match. Choosing which one you want to play would be great, I personally dont enjoy playing female characters as much haha.

Surely I could come up with some more ideas but I would love to hear what other players have to say and what is their opinion on the current state of the game and what they would like to be implemented / improved / fixed.

I highly recommend doing some ""build practice drops"" where you fly out farther away just to do some quick harvesting and practice building to get quick at making structures that you might want in a more tense situation. When your squad is down to 20 remaining (20 total, not 20 squads xD ) is not the time to be stumbling your way through building mechanics.

Note that any pattern shown on the left side, can be reversed. In fact, there's even a binding to reverse your pattern in game! (can't recall off the top of my head, it's shown on screen though)

Tried re-installing the Game and cannot even Download it.

I havent gotten any Email or notification if im banned or not, i just cannot click the play/download button.

If i got banned its totally deserved but i wonder, how long is the ban?

Pretty weird to not notify players in such a case if they are really banned or not and how long the ban is gonna be.

Anyone knows how they handle it?


None the less, cudos to the devs for reacting fast! We started our first teaming Game yesterday or so and if its really a ban, man they were quick!

Its a great Game and easily the most fun i had in a BR Game since a long time, secretly crossing fingers for it not beeing a perma ban.

Why is buying a KB and Mouse for a console so different?","I truly don't understand the anti PC/Console cross play crowd.

Epic has keyboard and mouse input in the game on console and on PS4 you can plug it in and use it. If you have a half decent mouse with DPI settings you can adjust your sensitivity on the fly. It's not perfect but it works and shows how easy cross play could be. Wouldn't it be amazing to have a much larger player base and connect all the console/pC players that may be friends and at the moment can't play together.


The main argument I see is ""I don't wanna spend extra money to be competitive""

But that's already a thing on console.
Spend money on a better controller with more buttons and options and you can play better. 

Some people even use adapters to use KB and Mouse on console in fps games.

So why is it so bad to open up the multiplayer community and put full control for keyboard and mouse options in the game and let people choose how they want to play??

My Suggestions","I have a few suggestions and the community can give their feedback on my opinions, but I think some if not all these will be important to maintain a healthy subreddit.

- Get rid of the report teaming/hacking thread, and put a link on the sidebar redirecting people to the forum on the website for specifically that and in my opinion these 'reporting' posts should be banned because they don't really add any discussion, just validation if that makes sense.
- Add a Daily General Discussion/Feedback sticky thread for general comments or feedback that don't warrant their own subreddit post. Just so one liners won't clog up the subreddit. I've been guilty of this myself
- Do not suppress any discussions regarding hacking or any problem if that does happen, do ban people advertising the programs, but if you suppress any discussion it'll hurt the game &amp; the reddit community from being able to openly talk about any issues regarding the game assuming this happens because it always happens at least once during a game's lifecycle.
- Get ready to deal with self promotion, it's a delicate topic imho, but I think if you're 'spamming' as in posting multiple videos a day to your content and that's all you do and don't engage in the community then you should be considered spamming, but say there's a guy that creates really good content and posts say once a few times week that doesn't come off as spam, but is also engaging in the communities shenanigans then I don't think that's a problem.
- Let people post their memes in the daily discussion thread, I get one off threads are banned, but I still think being able to post something funny once in awhile should be allowed at least in that thread since individual posts are completely off limits per the rules.

I think I hit it all and I'm ready for this free to play launch and hopefully the future of fortnite battle royale.

Right now FNBR is currently using spread and hit scan for its Gun Mechanics and we're all noticing this, ever shot at someone with perfect aim and missed somehow? Yeah that's the spread telling you ""go F*** Yourself!"".

There is alternative to this where the bullets are 100% accurate and this will require players to lead shots and make up a players strafe, rather than pull the trigger and hope RNGesus is on your side.

So as a community, who in theory are in control of the games development as we will be playing possibly for years to come, lets decide what we think is best for this game.

100% accuracy that rewards the better shot or Spread which rewards the luckier player?

Personally I prefer to win via being a better shot and I wrote this with a slight bias, but hell, what you guys think?",FortNiteBR
393,koreanoverlord,1506282618,727ayx,33,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/727ayx/the_spread_is_intentional/,22,The spread is intentional.,"I'm a long time (Bungie) Halo player. Halo has a very similar mechanic as Fortnite does, and it's not by accident.

The older Halos were the only FPS game you could walk to the middle of the map and not get gunned down by a laser accurate AR. It was intentional and crucial to the balance of Halo. An AR in Halo is useless after a few feet. This promoted using the best weapon for the job instead of just focusing on aiming. If you take a new playing in Halo 3 and compared him to someone who knows how the game works, the good player will most likely never die to him until he learns.

Even though PUBG has an unforgiving aiming system, you still get shot from several hundred meters away and die instantly. I believe Epic wanted to combat this by having a weapon system like Halo.

In PUBG, an AR is basically king. Sure a sniper is better, but they all fit the same role. Laser accurate weapons that can kill a player without being seen. The roles of the weapons in Halo is more diversified. With the exception of the BR (which will still lose in close range), every weapon is only good at a certain range.

There is this safety radius you have from other players. Unless if they have the sniper, you will be safe until you get close enough. Most of the videos being posted on here are just players that are too trigger happy, wanting to zap someone from across a mountain.

It may take out some of the aiming skill, but it increases the game sense skill and will provide a wider skill gap IMO.",FortNiteBR

The SCAR-H has is seemingly unaffected by the RNG of Bloom in this game, where as at 15ft the Burst Fire or Semi Auto Rifles will have a pretty high degree of RNG Bloom causing a lot of shots to miss, the SCAR-H will hit everywhere you aim regardless of the Bloom effect.

It was to prevent from being 2 tapped at a distance, especially from good players that could pull it off consistently. Obviously, that's not a very fun experience for the receiving end.

Shotguns (the Semi Auto especially) are extremely inaccurate at close range as the spread is terrible because we have bloom, the worst part is Shotguns at medium range act more like hunting rifles and most commonly complained about for range. 

Semi Auto Rifles seem to perform badly at close to Mid range with the easiest clear shot you can get, rather than getting kill from a double tap you some how will miss the shot due to the heavy RNG of Bloom.

SMG is practically useless for run n gun tactics due to the bloom and recoil on the SMG, making this a terrible weapon to get off spawn.

The Burst Fire Assult Rifle I will admit is actually okay for the bloom RNG and seems more consistent than other weapons in regards to hit registration. 

The reason Im making this post is because when the player population spikes up on 26th when FNBR go F2P the first many player with complain about is the Bloom and its RNG. I remember when Halo: Reach came out and Bungie decided to change from projectile to RNG based Hit Scan and it anger quite a bit of the community that they change the way gun fights took place. So please Epic remove the whole bloom system and save yourselves a lot of complaints in the future.

&amp;nbsp;  
Our VP of Engineering, Daniel Vogel wanted to share some upcoming development plans for Battle Royale. You can view some weapon images over on the [official blog](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-state-of-development):  
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt; We hope you all have been having a good time playing Fortnite Battle Royale. We’re working hard to make sure you have plenty to look forward to in your quest to earn umbrellas. So, we want to give everyone an update!   
&amp;nbsp;  
Our big news is the initial version of **Squads** coming 9/26 with support for DBNO (down but not out), duos (2 players) and squads (1-4 players). Emphasis is on “initial” as we are optimizing for getting the feature out ASAP and will continue to iterate and polish afterwards. The squads playlist will be enabled on 9/26 and we will monitor population numbers to decide when to enable duos. In-game communication (text, voice, hints, etc) is crucial for auto-filled teams and is next on the list.  
&amp;nbsp;  
We hope the introduction of Squads will reduce the desire for teaming in solo play. That being said, we stood up a system that will **automatically and swiftly ban teamers**. We’ve been manually running the detection tool to verify results and Player Support has been using the results to ban teamers for almost a week. The full automation will go live with the 9/26 update.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Cheating (aimbots, overlays, and such) is something we take seriously on both the legal and development front. Going free increases the challenge and is lighting a fire under our efforts. It is hard to talk about what we’re doing here without making it easier for cheat creators… so we won't :-) ***Cheaters are banned***!  
&amp;nbsp;  
&gt; Coming in the **Sept. 26 build**:

&gt; 1. **Squads**!  
2. A **mid-range scoped assault rifle** and a **mid-range SMG** to round out the weapon line-up.
3. **HUD** tweaks to make it easier to see markers and direction indicators.
4. Lots of **other tweaks** that will be documented in detail in our release notes.
&gt;
&amp;nbsp;  
Coming soon ***after the Sept. 26 build***:  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Supply drops** will allow introduction of some of the more zany weapons from the “Save the World” Campaign, and help us tune the timing of when specific weapons drop during a match. Our internal playtests showed supply drops adding more excitement to the mid-game over the fight to secure them. Depending on how balancing and testing goes they might be in 9/26 or the following week.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Combat feel** encompasses a broad area and we have a few initiatives in the works that deserve their own post in the next week. See our post here for recent changes.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Improvements for inventory management like picking up ammo, resources, and traps by just walking over them. In the long term we are going to overhaul the inventory system.  
&amp;nbsp;  
We love **stats** and analytics and will  show you the basics over the next few weeks.  
&amp;nbsp;  
After providing stats we’ll focus on **Leaderboards** / **Scoreboards** and **Rankings**. Leaderboards / Scoreboards reward successful placement and game actions, while Ranking is a direct reflection of your skill. We’re evaluating algorithms for each of them and want to be careful we don’t change the goal to be the last player standing.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Cosmetic items** are coming soon. New glider skins are a first example of this and there will be other categories as well. This requires the ability to select and choose variations in the UI, and of course a way for you to earn them by playing the game.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Console controller layouts** are being revisited right now to see whether there is a different approach. This is something that will take some time to get right, but we will give you updates as progress is made.  
&amp;nbsp;  
The following information is a bit more on the engineering side, but I’m an engineer so hey :-)  
&amp;nbsp;   
We are currently running dedicated servers in Virginia (USA) and Frankfurt (Germany). Our infrastructure allows us to fairly easily spin up **servers in other regions** once a certain population threshold has been reached to ensure a good matchmaking experience.  
&amp;nbsp;  
We are happy with, but always looking to improve the minimum *network bandwidth* required to play the game and *server performance* after the first few minutes. What we’re not yet happy with is server performance during the lobby and very early phase of the match. This is an area that is requiring some higher level optimizations to our networking code.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Overall **client performance** is something we need to keep an eye on to ensure it is not getting worse. Same goes for *input latency*. Please holler if you are experiencing issues with either.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Client stability** settled at around 100 hours of MTBF (mean time between failure) for Battle Royale. That means on average the game crashes every 100 hours of gameplay. Crashes are never acceptable and we are continuously working on the top crashes. ***Please let us know if you are running into frequent crashes to help us track them down***! The 100-hour number is on the lower end of our comfort zone, but we also want to make sure we don’t sacrifice development velocity and deliver new features at a rapid pace.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Server stability** thus far has been good *knocks on wood*… which is crucial as a single crash can impact up to 100 players at once! The goal here is to be above 10,000 hours MTBF and very rapidly address crashes and deploy servers with rolling updates as to not impact players further.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Thanks and we’ll see you in game,  
Daniel Vogel

I've had 15 total wins since the game came out on PS4.
You can see all the wins here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6ZwXhnRbi2VS_xUsCGVCGJaIeFxMyYNA

A few things that I've learned so far.

1 - Sometimes killing somebody isn't worth it. It took me a while to realize this but just killing somebody because you can isn't the best strategy.  When you kill somebody not only do you let other people in your area know where you are at but you waste ammo that you will need at the end of the match to win.  If you can only fight when you have to. You see a guy inside a house? leave him... just keep going towards the circle. You see other people fighting? let them kill each other. ONLY FIGHT WHEN YOU HAVE TO!

2 - Learning to build fast - A lot of times you'll get shot and you have to react fast and build a wall or stairs to get out of the situation. I still haven't mastered this because I play on PS4 and it's soo hard to switch and press the triangle the exact amount of times to get what you need but it's very important.


3 - FARM FARM FARM - You need to farm. It will be very hard for you to win if you don't farm. If you clear out an area (say the farm) stay a bit and farm some metal/brick for end game.  

4 - Don't use the Auto Shotgun - This thing is trash. I avoid it like the plague. I rather have a pump white then a blue/purple Auto


5 - Make sure to switch to your axe and loot all the ammo items first before you switch to your guns and start swapping them.

I've been playing Paragon since closed beta, love the game, but I always saw players complaining about cross-platform console + PC matchmaking.

In Paragon case, Epic always said it doesn't matter much because there are no headshots, the hitboxes are different, it's a MOBA and not a shooter. I totally agree, I'm there with Epic.

Then comes Fortnite, and again, it was OK to have cross-platform consoles and PC, because it was a co-op PvE experience, so even if there are more hitboxes and headshots, the precision gameplay was against Zombies AI.

But now, with Fortnite Battle Royale, does the rule still apply? Are we playing all together in the same matchmaking? Because there's a clear advantage for PC with mouse VS consoles with gamepads, it doesn't matter how good you are with the gamepad.

So what does the players and Epic have to say about that?

Any video, screenshot, or similar link that includes a player's name and accuses them of hacking, teaming, or any other form of cheating is not allowed.

I'm not saying these people don't exist and aren't awful, but the subreddit isn't the place to litigate these issues.  Instead, [you can submit an official report to Epic here](http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/).

I saw some of my favorite streamers play FortBR and it looked silly to me yet intriguing. My girlfriend actually pushed me to get it since she would see me watch it all the time. So that being said...

I really enjoy this game. The art, the environment, the map design, the gun fights. It's all really cool to me. People complain about the ""bloom"" but in a game like this, I feel like it somewhat belongs. I kind of wish Rifles were a bit more accurate at range, but the weapons all have their place in certain types of fights.

Building is such a cool aspect to the game and so different from anything I've ever played before. It adds that dimension of creativity and strategy and it's really cool to see how people protect themselves in different situations.

The couple of issues I do have and they're not huge:

1) I feel like I hear my own footsteps (the sound effect of when you jump and land) and it seems to be away from me where I think it's an enemy. I have a great headset and all the other sounds seem fine but that just happens sometimes.
2) I hope to see a better end game UI. I want to see how many kills I got (without having to look before the last fight is over/clipping it), along with some other stats (favorite weapon of the match, damage dealt, damage taken, etc.)
3) Spectate. Clearly spectating players when you die is a part of the game, but it would be great to be able to cycle through everyone in the game. Seeing hitmarkers would also be great to see while spectating someone in a battle.

This game has a ton of potential with maps, character/gun customization that I could see myself playing this for a while.

Directed to **EPIC**: Please listen to your community and PLEASE communicate with us. You honestly have a potential gold mine with this game if things are done right and so far, you're on the right track so thank you!

**TL:DR** Not usually my type of game but love it and can't wait for squads and other additions.",FortNiteBR

Tested 10 min ago","PC players still play with PS4, despite what the devs claim. I just tested this 10 min ago. I watched a twitch streamer that played on PS4. Wrote down some names in the game (a bunch) and tried to look them up through PSN profile search. 

* Point 1. Some guys show up as ""no data found"". My two PSN profiles have everything set to private and it still finds the profiles and my profile pics (just not any other data like trophies, recent activities, library etc.)

* Point 2. I also saw guys in Fortnite with names that are impossible to have on PSN, i.e. names with spaces. These names are possible on the PC version, have tested it.

* Point 3. Some guys I searched had open profiles on PSN but no Fortnite copy in games or in recent activities. This means they probably have the same username on PC as their PSN and play on PC.

* Point 4 The community manager first [wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/71b8g2/fortnite_battle_royale_free_sept_26_faq/dn9exms/) that PS4 had both cross-progression and cross-play with PC. He then got called out on it and had to edit his post to to remove the cross-play. Shouldn't he know this? He said he ""talked to the team and they turned it off for PS4"". Turn off? Didn't they say it was an unintentional glitch? Seems shady to me.

* Point 5. This point is not something I can verify but what made me to do this test in the first place. A guy posted a full match video (that was removed for witch hunting) of a suspected aimbotter on here. The aimbotter won the game with like 30+ kills and had INSANE aim and reactions (I would bet everything I own that he was aimbotting). The guy played on PS4. Aimbots or maphacks are impossible on PS4 and Xbox one due to their closed systems not allowing any third-party program to be installed. The guy claimed that the game was from today which is after the ""glitch"" that made Xbox/PS4/PC play together was fixed. I don't think it was fixed.

I just realized that Point 1-3 can also mean that they are playing on Xbox. And I just found a guy in the PS4 game with a very unusual name like 4letters3numbers3sameletters (avoiding witch hunting), that is online right now on Xbox (through https://www.xboxgamertag.com/). I don't know how reliable that site is but either way, it is pretty clear to me that PS4 players are not only playing against other PS4 players.

&amp;nbsp;   
The Fortnite Battle Royale mode takes the gameplay of battle royale games and adds all of the action-building pieces unique to Fortnite. This 100-player PvP world will allow you to locate weapons and supplies, destroy enemy cover, drop traps, and build your way to victory.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Here’s some general information for questions you may have:  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Is Battle Royale really free?**  
*Yes, starting on September 26. We launched a public test and it worked better than we expected. We want the game to reach as many players as possible, so we decided to release Battle Royale for free sooner than we anticipated.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Squads. Where are the squads?**  
*Squads are coming 9/26. We’ll share more details in the Fortnite Release Notes.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Where are the vehicles?**  
We are prototyping some ideas but don’t know how they will fit into the game. We’ll let you know more soon.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Will you add more maps?**  
*Yes, but not right away.*  
 &amp;nbsp;  
**What else are you working to immediately improve or add?**  
*We’re working to improve the feel of combat, controls, weapons and movement. We’re also working to streamline inventory management.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
*Find out more information [on what’s coming here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/forums/battle-royale/royale-with-cheese/65589-fortnite-battle-royale-upcoming-improvements).*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**I bought the game for the PvP Battle Royale mode on PC last week. Since it’s free now, can I have a refund?**  
*Yes. If you purchased Fortnite between Sept. 12 and Sept. 19 to get access to Battle Royale, and you would like a refund, [contact us](http://fortnitehelp.epicgames.com/) and we’ll give you one. Fortnite Battle Royale will still be available to you for free.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Why did Epic make only Battle Royale free?  When will the whole game be free?**  
*We still have a lot of features to add before the PvE campaign is complete. We will launch the Save the World PvE campaign for free in 2018.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Now that Battle Royale is free, does that mean that PvP development is complete?**
*No. Fortnite is still in development and we will continue to improve and expand both the PvE Save the World Campaign and PvP game modes.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Does Battle Royale mean that Fortnite is abandoning PvE?**  
*No. The team has big plans and is continuing to add features and develop new modes to play, including the previously announced “Block Party” mode. Stay tuned for some spooky details on our October updates soon.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Will my progress in Fortnite PvE campaign transfer over into Battle Royale?**  
*For now, PvE and PvP are not connected and we don’t know if Battle Royale will eventually connect to the Fortnite Campaign. We are considering cosmetic connections between PvE and PvP and compendium-like content, but we’re still figuring it out. Let us know what you think would be cool.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Will Fortnite Battle Royale be pay-to-win?**  
*No. We will not sell items that give a competitive advantage. At some point in the future we will sell other things including cosmetics or compendium-like content.*  
&amp;nbsp;   
**What if I want to purchase the Save the World Campaign?**  
*You can purchase a Founder's Pack on PC here or through the PlayStation and Xbox stores.*  
&amp;nbsp;  
If you have questions, ask away! We'll do our best to provide answers.

First a little bit about myself so you guys know that im not just talking out of my ass. So far i have gotten 9 wins with numerous 2nd and 3rd places. I have no previous experience with BR games besides very few games of PUBG, which i really dislike btw.

Now onto the good stuff:
1.) Loot: You can go to the towns for loot, however most will go to those and you will be fighting with a lot of people over surprisingly not that much loot. Instead what you should do is go to the destroyed buildings spread over the map. Those have almost always a chest, some bandages and a gun. Sometimes you can even get sniper rifles and a shield.

2.) Shield: This brings me to my second point: avoid activating your shield in the early game. Instead safe it up for later use. The reason for that is that, if you get shot your shield will take damage even if it would have not been lethal damage. This means that if you wouldnt have activated your shield you could just heal up to 75 health with bandages. Now if you have your shield and no medkit you can heal to 125 instead of the 100 you would have after your shield is depleted. Thats 25 health more then before.

3.)  Guns: Next i want to give you guys a bit of clarification about the guns because although it doesnt might not seem that way you have 3 power weapons: the rocketlauncher, the noobtube and the sniper. In order to increase your winning chances significantly you have to have one of those weapons. Now depending on your playstyle and so on and so worth you might prefer one over the other and thats fine because i think they are pretty even in terms of impact in the late late stage of the games.
So to give you an idea on how your loadout should look like at the end: 
1. an ar (either the m4 or the scar)
2. the autoshotgun for close combat
3. bandages or medkit
4. shieldpotions
5. one of the 3 powerweapons.
This is in my opinion the best loadout to win. Ofcourse you want to get higher quality and so on, but this is the baseline.

4.) Building: Next up is making use of the building feature. This is something a lot of people havent quiet figured out yet i think. First of make it a habbit to use the different f-keys to build. That will give you more flexibility and will be a lot quicker if you need to get up cover quickly. It is also really important to have the nessecary resources. You want to aim for 600 total. In a perfect world you would want that to be 600 metal because metal is better then wood and brick but the chances of you ever getting that is really slim. Instead what you want to do is split the 600 equally in 200 wood, 200 brick and 200 metal. Obviously more is always better but that's what you are looking for. The reason behind that is that once the circles get smaller you can use wood to build your base. Then you can use brick and in the end you use metal. I find it extremely effective to place 4 walls in a square with a stairway in the middle. This gives you the perfect headglitch spot and the possibility to get even more highground if you need to because this base can just be stacked on top of each other.

5.) Highground: This is also the next point: highground. This might seem like a pretty obvious thing, but highground is huge in this game. You can easily hear people building stairways up your hill and if you build a base on top of a hill you can safe resources to achieve the highground because you are already in an elevated position. This is really star wars esque as in if you have the highground you cant loose.

6.) Circle: The last point for now is circle. What you want to do is whenever you see a new circle spawning is looking for the position with the highest ground because as i stated previously high ground is super important. Once you found that is you want to move at the edge of the circle until you can make sure that you can safely advance to that position. This way you assure that you cant get shot in the back and safely get to your position. Once you are on top of that position you build your base and then proceed as i told you before. You just rinse and repeat this then until there are no real highground positions anymore. At that point you will have to make your own by using the building technique i showed you.

I hope that this helps you guys on improving and hopefully get that next or perhabs even first win.

You have to understand that as a console player I've wanted some type of BR game for a very long time.

It started with H1Z1 (they where suppose to bring that to ps4) then PUBG (but it's going to xbox one first)

So when I heard about this game I bought 2 copies for myself and my son.

When I bought this game I had no idea that I would be playing vs PC users.

No where in the PSN Store or Their website does it say ""Play vs PC/Xbox users"" 

Now it might be fine for PVE because you aren't going against them but playing WITH them.

I already mentioned before why PC shouldn't play vs PS4 but that thread got closed down because of a video that I posted.

The video shows a PS4 Streamer on Twitch going against a Hacker on PC. After getting killed by the hacker he spectates him until the end of the game.

This streamer had close to 200 viewers watching. Yes I know 200 viewers isn't much but remember he is a ps4 streamer so these could of been Fornite PS4 customers... if it wasn't for the fact that they saw what I saw.

a PC player with aimbot shooting and killing everybody like nothing. The streamer gets upset and wonders the same thing I do. Why are PS4 users going vs PC users? 

PS4 is locked @ 30 FPS - PC isn't

PS4 can't adjust the graphics of the game - PC can

PS4 Can't use a mouse and keyboard (yet) since there's no way to adjust the sens of the mouse - PC CAN

PS4 Can't allow people to have with wallhacks or aimbot - PC can


so again I'll ask... why are we playing vs PC users?

are you guys going to remove this?

if this isn't getting removed then who do I talk to in order to get a refund?





Some of you guys are missing the point.
I guess I'm just too stupid to explain myself so I will try again.

I have 2 Regular PS4's and 1 PS4 Pro. If you add that up I could of easily bought a PC.
I choose to buy a PS4 for a few reasons. The main reason tho is cheaters/hackers.
You might say ""i've never encountered a cheater"" but you are wrong every game has cheaters. That's besides the point.

So as a consumer I choose to buy a ps4.
I play with my son and with my wife.

Now this game comes out and I'm like ""heck yeah! BR on console lets go!""
except Epic doesn't let me know BEFORE I buy the game that I'm going against the PC cheaters that I'm trying to avoid.

This is their game. If they want to have PC vs PS4 users then they can do that. My Problem is that they didn't TELL me before I bought the game that I was going against PC users. Shouldn't a customer know what he's buying before he buys?

2. Ammo should automatically be picked up: It can get annoying when I'm trying to pick up shotgun shells when it's right next to a pistol and a gotta run around the items until I pick up the ammo.

3.  Scopes: I know it's a long shot but some x2 &amp; x4 scopes would be nice when engaging targets at medium/long range with the semi/burst/auto rifles. 

4. Be able to rotate the camera 360° while still running forwards: Like you know you sprint one way and you can still look behind you or to the left or right while still staying in the same direction. 

5. Armor is visible: Instead of being a potion, make it say a vest and helmet that's visibke on your and others' playermodels. That way you know what you're up against.

This is just my opinion. It is subject to change.",FortNiteBR

The other creators of Dota 1 went to League of Legends and designed their own game. Now even though Dota was first league became way bigger. The question now is, why was that? As it turns out it was because dota is a lot more clunky and more complicated then League is. Many people prefered the simpler version: League of Legends. To me Fortnite feels a lot like League. You have PUBG which technically was here first, however its so clunky,bugged and unintuitive that i prefer the ""dumbed"" down version of fortnite. I also think that a lot of people are attracted by the unique artstyle that fortnite brings. It is different from the generic dayz/ arma look that pubg has, which again helps to gain popularity, perhabs even with younger players. I think that epic really has a potential big hit here if they play their cards right and im curious as to how you think this game might turn out compared to pubg and other br titles",FortNiteBR

I'm definitely better than average, but I find myself losing a LOT of 1 on 1 gunfights. Today I got my 10th win, and I wanted to jot down my thoughts while I spent the day watching football.

I'll get right into it, and I want to talk about my cons with the game before the pros. I'm listing my complaints in order of what I feel are the biggest problems first.

**Cons**

* **It is far easier to win if you do everything you can to avoid other players**

I think this is due to a few factors, which I'll elaborate a bit on lower. All of my wins have been 7 kills or fewer, with seven being 4 kills or fewer, and three being 2 or fewer. I'm not sure if this is mirrored in PUBG, but it's worrying that the more passively I play, the better odds I have of winning.

* **The terrain provides too much cover and doesn't punish poor positioning**

I spend a LOT of my time moving slowly towards the circle because cover is so amply available. Even when I'm crossing fields, there's hardly any time where I feel that I'm truly exposed. The hills are deep enough and the open spaces small enough where only an accurate sniper can put me at a disadvantage no matter where I am.


* **The map is too small**

I acknowledge this is more of a personal opinion, but I thought it should be mentioned. As it stands, you can go to any corner of the map and make it to the first circle with little to no hassle. I understand there isn't much EPIC can do here without vehicles, as nobody wants to be dead on arrival because of a poor circle, but giving a player enough time to slowly glide/walk to the far edge and back without taking damage is not a fun element to BR's gameplay.

* **There aren't enough defensive options available, which keeps time to kill (TTK) too low**

As it stands right now, the only forms of defense are shield potions, building cover, or hiding. By now, you know which one I feel is the most effective. Shield potions are noted in my ""pros"" section, and building in both ""pros"" and ""cons."" Because of this dearth, most gunfights are over extremely quickly, and end up feeling like a coin flip rather than a battle.

I think instead of tweaking the current defensive options, more need to be added. Adding more loot to better reward aggressive early gameplay would go a long way to disincentivize passive play. An easy example is PUBG's armor. I think (hope) EPIC are working on something to implement here, so this may be a moot point in the upcoming weeks.

* **The gun rarity has too little of an impact for everything sans snipers**

I've won a few games equipped with uncommons (greens) or worse, and even a couple with only a common (gray) AR. Because there is no armor other than getting an extra health bar, accuracy, not damage, is king. That's not (necessarily) the problem. 

However, due to two of my previous complaints (terrain cover and map size), most fights are very close combat. When you add in the low TTK, basically half of the benefits for rarity are negated. You don't need a good gun because most shots hit, and health is low. First shot usually wins. This furthers the narrative that you don't need to earn good weapons to win, which in turn again rewards extremely passive play.

* **Building doesn't have as much impact as I was hoping**

I'm not sure if this is a bad thing, but something else I wanted to note. We're very early in the meta of the game, so this could be something that hasn't been properly fleshed out by the community. As of right now, I have yet to see a builder succeed in combat. Any build in the sky is simply destroyed from its weakest link, which kills the builder. Any build on the ground is a two-way barrier, and is often destroyed by a small amount of gunfire.

The building to traverse terrain is fun and unique, but it seems like the fun ends there. I'm not sure if there is a fix to this, because I'd dislike the inverse even more: buildings being nearly indestructible would encourage power forts and camping. However, if the person spent enough time to harvest enough resources and build their own mega base, do they not deserve an advantage? I'm unsure, honestly.


**Pros**

I'm going to keep this section much shorter, because BR has a LOT of little things that are done very well.

* Gunplay is tight

* Shield potions &amp; snipers are great and the only things that reward seeking out conflict/loot

* Art style and aesthetics are beautiful

* Areas are unique and (relatively) well crafted

* UI is solid

* Building is a breath of fresh air and allows dynamic movement and creative gameplay

So, there it is. Mostly rambling, and not exhaustive, but I wanted to give the perspective of someone who has found success early. I hope this was interesting enough to read, and maybe good enough to spark some discussion.

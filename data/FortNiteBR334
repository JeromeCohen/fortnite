As we all know Fortnite is free. Well, what we don’t all know is, is that YOU NEED TO PURCHASE PLAY STATION PLUS TO DOWNLOAD A FREE FREAKIN GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What type of shit is this?


So what I’m suggesting here is that my fellow Fortnite players send me money to help me purchase play station plus SOLELY to download Fortnite to continue playing. 

I only have one solo win (NOT EVEN ON MY OWN ACCOUNT!!!!) and I’m really trying to do better now that I have my own name and what not. Thanks!


PS. I cannot do 14 day trial as I’ve purchased PS+ in the past. (You know, back when I could afford it.) 

Anything helps, THANKS!!!!!!! ",FortNiteBR

I know it's not unusual, but what bugged me is that, at least here in Brazil, the difference is unfair. 

1 Pack os 1000 v-bucks costs US$ 9.99 on PC. Im Brazilian currency, it costs deppending on the price of the dollar, between R$ 35.00 to R$ 40.00. 
But here's the thing: On the Microsoft Store, the same pack costs R$19,00. Which is half of what a pc player pays, and on the Playstation Store it costs R$ 30.90.

I don't know how it works, but I wanted to point it out here, so I can know why we can't have fair prices on BRL on PC exclusevely, and to see what Epic can do. Also, I'm pretty sure not only Brazilian PC players would like some better prices, but all other countries that the dollar is kind of expensive now.

To make a comparison, the 2500 + 300 v-bucks pack would cost me R$ 90.00, and R$ 100.00 is my weekly gas spending.",FortNiteBR

Some of you will say well I can bring my friends in there. Ok cool are your friends any better then you? And if they are the sand box will not have guns so you won’t be able to die. Also your friend that’s good is he going to have to slow down to bring you to speed. After you learn counters will you be able to bring that to really good builders in game? You’re in a closed environment not a real game so all of you guys that can’t build while you are taking off to learn basics the good builders are going against good builders and getting better. So now the AVG is last weeks good player and since you still just learned how to build you are behind and that will happen every week if you don’t play against actual enemies.

Metero hit the map, the prison got destroyed and a villian called Omega made it out of the prison. He went to his lair near Snobby Shores mountain. Meanwhile the superheros mansion located on the East side of the map just south of Lonley lodge. The superheros, Carbide, Valor, Squad Leader, and Steel sight (cant remember her name) tried to locate and capture Omega. They found out that he escaped the prison after the metero incident. Meanwhile Omega gathered some troops (the male &amp;female version of the full steel/metal characters). All this based on blockbuster loading screens. While on the other side of the story. The biggest meteor hit Dusty and vanished quite a chunck of that area. The feds and an organazation arrived on dusty and took care of the meteor and turned the place to a research lab. Titlted, the car cinema, the motel, and other parts of the map got hit too but very small and tiny hits those are getting patched at some point. In week 2 we saw that dusty got a compelete makeover the research lab got 2x bigger and a bunker appeard in Willing woods (we dont know its function still). And now in this week (3) Tilted got patched and the hop rocks getting transfared out of tilted. Dusty remained the same, but the meteor cooled down and it's about to crack and there is something metalic/mechanic inside it. Know one knows yet. 
And that's all I have picked since the season started. If anyone got suggestions or anything feel free to share it wit us.",FortNiteBR

Im just curious if I could have the same gaming experience as I did with my laptop by buying an extra keyboard and mouse for the ps4 cuz im more used to that rather than a controller. Im only considering this cuz its cheaper for me plus I have other games I want to play on the ps4 anyways its just Fortnites the one im used to with m/kb.

I have a different play style to them, I don't engage with opponents unless it threatens my survival, but my friend will sometimes go out of his way (to the circle) to get eliminations and kills.

I somehow fail to see why a high frag victory is more satisfying than one similar to mine. 

Fortnite requires you manage your health against both the circle and your opponents. Any method that allows you effectively do that while eliminating all other players is the right approach, am I missing something here?

YOU DONT NEED KILL QUESTS IN TILTED

it’s a popular enough spot you don’t need to force people to drop there

I. Fucking. Hate. Tilted. 

It’s a mistake. It’s awful. At least 30 to 40 players a game drop there

1.) that’s just outrageous and makes getting WEAPONS let alone kills a nightmare.

2.) makes landing other places less fun because 50% of the competition gets cut out in the first 5 mins.

And that’s all BEFORE you make us all drop there. The “get kills in “ missions are supposed to draw attention to less popular locations. Pleas have a “get kills at containers” quest or something not tilted.

Thank you


(Side note) please just increase ammo and material drops in chests and remove them as floor drops! It’s so fucking annoying when no skin Tim over here gets a blue ar and all I get to combat that is some shotgun shells. THE FUCK YOU WANT ME TO DO THROW THEM AT HIM?",FortNiteBR

I am trying to figure out how to switch between a campfire, trap, jump pad on PC. I have traps set to F5, and trap equip/picker set to T. For some reason pressing T does not change the trap type that I will automatically pull out by pressing F5. I have to drop my damage traps or whatever I'm currently holding that I don't want to use in order to get whichever item I want to use as my F5 option which of course takes precious seconds away from me. I am new to PC gaming in genera (about 2 months) and am complete trash at Fortnite after 2 weeks of play, but I am having a hell of a lot of fun boosting everyone else's K/D's. You can make fun of me for not knowing this if it makes you feel better, but I really just want to know how to do this so I can at least picture getting a cool trap kill before I get pumped in the face.

And they just want it because it's exclusive. They can't let people have nice things.

Here's a solution.

When an OG skull trooper or ghoul gets a kill, have bats chase them for 2 seconds and then fade away. Sound effects can be player side only and very soft to not be a competitive disadvantage. Also have the bats as a generic emote for the OG players for all skins. Scythe is just a pickaxe it honestly doesn't need anything. 

That way Epic gets money, the wannabe myths get their skins and the OGs still have status and an exclusive emote. It really wasn't a promised exclusive so its fair.. 

Also just throwing this here.. Capes are like super cool.. If you could give battle pass 1 owners capes and then never release any other capes as backbling that would be cool... 

No backbling will ever compare to a cape Epic, plus the battle passes will only get better in the future. There will be no reason at all to use any battle pass 1 items...

I used the [film scheduling](https://imgur.com/hrHB5ft) at risky,which I think was recently changed and the blockbuster challenges. 

*TL;DR : Omega is the super villain of season 4, and  Carbide, Valor and Special Agent are trying to catch him. In week 4, we'll see him giving a speech to his Chrome Soldiers.*

**Part 1 : The Meteor**

That meteor was surely the most hyped thing in all of season 3. We all asked ourselves what it would mean for season 4. And, apparently, it means big.

The first Blockbuster gives us [that loading screen](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qBSFqCtuFSCz9aytrEMooZ-650-80.jpeg). In it we see a movie set, most likely filming fortnite's ""The shape of water"".

In the background, we see a meteor crashing down on the prison. Now we all know how the prison looks like now. Many cells have been opened. Keep that in mind.

*The Secret Star for this week is located on the* [far right tower of the prison.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mRr4hDfAd2tGs2wpguACoZ-650-80.jpeg)

**Part 2 : Omega's Escape**

When the Season 4 Battle Pass dropped, we all thought Omega was a better version of Carbide. Well, we were wrong. Omega is actually the evil counter part of Carbide. Like a reverse Flash to Flash. In [the loading screen](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZTADTVcW8wzAZ7ArXFumZ-650-80.jpeg) of week 2, we can assume \(rightly so, more on that later\) that Omega is escaping the prison. 

*The Secret Star for this week is located on* [the intersection of A3\-A4\-B3\-B4](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TcrLQjvFYtwnMht4rcDhmZ-650-80.jpeg)

**Part 3 : Where is Omega**

On [the 3rd loading screen](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DdTgqZpXUAEiyr4.jpg) we get, we see the super heroes assessing the situation. They are most likely talking about Omega's escape, thinking of the next steps. Judging by the background, they are in the secret base, under the mansion, West of the map.

*The Secret Star for this week is located on* [the hill East of Fatal Fields, under the meteor's hole](https://s3.dexerto.com/articles/fortnite-week-3-loading-screen-star.jpg)

**Part 4 : Omega and his Chrome Army**

I don't know if this is actually for the week 4, but [this loading screen](https://s3.dexerto.com/articles/hidden-battle-star-week-3.jpg) was found in the game files. Omega is likely giving orders to his Chrome Army in the secret bunker next to Snobby Shores. He might be planning to take over the world. Or he knows what is inside the meteor in Dusty Divot.

*The secret star for this week will be located next to the rocket in* [the bunker west of Snobby Shores.](https://s3.dexerto.com/articles/hidden-battle-star-week-3-map-location.jpg)

Back then, everyone sucked and there were hardly any hardcore god-level players (or so it seemed), and I actually considered myself good at the game. Now, hardcore gamers are literally all I run into and the game is starting to feel like Counter Strike in the sense that you are either AMAZING or suck dick and have 0 chance.

Hi. So I’ve played fortnite since january and I have improved alot the past months. My solo stats is currently 911 games and 934 kills but I’ve got just 1 W. I get 5+ kills a game usually and place top 10 1/3 og the games. I’ve also got 2nd place alot lately probably 20+ of them and it sucks. My win was just like all of the 2nd places but I just got the last guy. I am 2x as good now as back then and I seem kinda stuck here. Note that I never play “drop at Lonely, hide, stay on egde of circle, camp, camp, hide, hide and no kills” kind of games. I push, I build and usually I kill them but top 5 is where I’m struggling. So my question: is it rly bad win/games played ratio or what do u think?

TL;DR 1 Win, 900 Games, 900 Kills in solo. Your thoughts?",FortNiteBR

They have auto aim so they will 9/10 times just outgun you or snipe you from close  to long range. And if they are bad players rush them forsure because they cant build. HOWEVER all you have to do is build at them and shoot your shotgun. They have auto aim on that too so watchout but they are usually terrible and cant build/slow reactions so you should be able to win the head to head. 

Unless someones doing some crazy shit they are probably a controller player because it appeals to 90&amp;#37; of the userbase. So just rush them.",FortNiteBR

My password had been changed and after resetting it I logged on to see my battle pass had been purchased completely and with 48,000 Vbucks. I'll include a screenshot of my payment history from my Epic Games account as well as my PayPal and as you can see there was a payment error with one of the purchases as my bank had cancelled the card.

EpicGames: https://imgur.com/gallery/A5lHPqs
PayPal: https://imgur.com/gallery/GRXwMbM
In-game: https://imgur.com/gallery/PTyBur9

I immediately called my bank to cancel these charges as well as cancelling my card. I removed my payment information off of my account as well and set-up two factor authentication. After doing some research I noticed many people had gone through the same thing and that some people have been banned for going to their banks to get their money back. This is about $390+ taken out of my account that I cannot afford to lose nor wait for a response to resolve this issue. If I can get in contact with anybody from Epic that can help me resolve this issue I would very much appreciate it. I don't want to risk my account getting banned over something like this.

##**What are we looking for?**

Last time we put out applications, we had about 900 applicants to sort through. We are really looking for people who stand out and meet the following criteria:

* **DON'T MIND BEING A ROBOT**. We are looking for people who do not mind doing menial and repetitive work. We are looking for those who can assist and go through the modqueue and unmoderated posts on a consistent basis.

* Any time zone and availability. We do want as much flexibility as possible. There are 2 key times we are looking at to cover

 * 4:00 AM EST / 8:00 AM GMT (To help with patch downtime and when the game comes back online)
 * 8:00 PM EST / 12:00 AM GMT (To help during shop reset madness and when our new favorite skins come)

* Over the age of 18. Due to some of the language and links we see, we ask that all applicants be over the age of 18.

* Love Fortnite: Battle Royale

* CSS experience while not required, is a plus.

If selected, we will reach out to you. We look forward to reading the applications!

**Note:** This is just an approximate way to check your progress throughout the season. This does not take into account that you will earn XP faster the further you progress through the Battle Pass nor does it account for the fact that once you hit tier 100, daily quests reward double the XP instead of stars. This chart just takes the total XP required for level 80 (532,250) and divides it by 70 days and the corresponding level for the cumulative XP on each day. I used days left since it's clearly shown on the Tier page. As of the posting of this table, there are 54 days left in season 4. **Again, if you're not level 44 yet, don't worry. You will earn XP faster the further you are into the BP.**",FortNiteBR

So I was thinking why not add a grenade (epic/legendary) which you throw at your downed team mates which will insta revive them? Balance wise, I’m not sure about what health you would be given upon revive, I’ll leave that up to you guys to decide, but maybe something like 25hp+25 shields? 

It wouldn’t have to be a grenade if you argue being able to throw it it a distance may be unbalanced; it could even be a revive station, where you put it down and t does the revive for you, whilst you protect your team mates during the revive? 

Thought?

If you hop into QuickPay (casual) mode you will see unethical teamcomps and people messing around. As of now you can fight the best player or a person who's in there very first match  and that makes fortnite great. You have people making sky bases, doing impulse plays and not only playing for the win but for the fun. This makes every fight unique. With competitive people will only use the best guns, drop the safest spots and avoid players that are high risk  but look dope (no scopes, rocket rides, impulse)

Also what we gather from the datamined loading screen is that Omega has gone back to his base by Haunted Hills, where the second bonus star was near, to create his army.

My hunch about the stars being clues to the next loading screen was correct. The Weekly Challenge 2 star was next to Omega's base which is where the 4th Weekly Challenge Screen is held.

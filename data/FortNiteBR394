I also have played shooter games for about 10 years now and would consider myself a pretty good judge of balancing things. So here it is:

Fortnite has gotten to a point where whoever builds better, wins. There’s minimal gun skill required anymore with how dominant shotgun + “build-to-win” is.

I also feel like I can’t just go into a game and have fun anymore. I feel like I HAVE to try my hardest to have fun.

1.  Back in late December, Donald Mustard had an interview where he was asked about including a speed potion to help players move faster for a short amount of time.  He said something along the lines of ""We like this idea a lot and expect to have something like it in the next 2 to 3 months.  Two months later, Save the World gets a hoverboard.

2.  A few months ago Epic said they're implementing new level streaming technology that will help with things like Rocket Riding.  I found this a bit odd because Rocket Riding worked fine at that point.  Could they have been getting ready for hoverboard riding with that update?

3.  Skins, gliders, emotes, back bling...Epic likes making money off skins.  Can you imagine how much money Epic would make off hoverboard skins?

4.  I have no idea but I would estimate Battle Royale brings in more than 100x the revenue that StW does.  I think the StW team is geared now to support Battle Royale with things like this.  It's hard for me to think they would create somwthing as complex as a hoverboard with hiverboard physics and not plan for it to hit Battle Royale eventually.

So I'm not saying I like this idea (or not like it) but I think it's fairly clear Battle Royale is getting the hoverboard eventually.  What do you think?",FortNiteBR

Everybody complaining about how he is so salty and so mad and why he is screaming all the time that he gets killed by players that arent as good. 

But why? 

I really understand Ninja. He is that kinda person who loves gaming and want to be the best in it. 

When i get killed i flame the hell out the guy who kills me. I dont mean it like that afterwards. I want to be better and i take the game seriously. Ninja is much more into the game. He wants to be the best in it. Every Game. H1Z1 PUBG and now Fortnite.

I bet many of you who got killed insulted the enemy, which is normal. Its the same when you are a fan of a sportsclub or anything. f.e. your favorite soccerteam losses. I bet you are not like ""Oh yeah this Team is better they deserve to win. Good Game man.""

Ninjas Streaming-Personality is the same like his Real Life Personality. If he doesnt like something he says it. If he is really hating on a guy he says it. Even if hes infront of 100000 viewers or not. He takes the Game seriously.

So instead of hating on him you be happy that his both personalities are the same. Many Streamers doenst show their real life personality on stream. Its gettin more and more rare.

Edit: Another option could be when you initially open the build menu you should stand but can crouch after that while in build mode. Also, they need to fix the fact that the crouch button does not work in order for it to be implemented. You should not have to jump to stand up.

Edit #2: I agree it sucks for epic since many people wanted this feature. They should have implemented it better though it is such a struggle and is completely a new mechanic experienced players do not have muscle memory for. Also, people need to stop suggesting stupid changes such as this one on reddit . There is no reason to add crouch to building it is meant to be a quick evasive/defensive move which can be used for cover and for ""crouching"" behind.

Do all skins have bling that can be applied to other skins, or do only certain ones have it? 

I know there are a lot of skins that have nothing in their backs, so I wasn’t sure if only certain skins offered it. 

The only skins I know of so far that do are:

Black Knight

Raptor

Blue Squire (and the female version)

Love ranger 

Cuddle team leader 

Red Knight

All the alpine ace skins and mogul master skins

I’m curious to see if skins like WuKong, Crackshot, shadow ops, ghoul trooper, and funk ops offer any kind of backpack bling that can go on other skins. 

If anyone can provide some info or links, feel free to comment.

Since patch 2.5.0 the stuttering and fps drop have really been a huge problem...

Before I could play with fps unlimited with like 110-140 fps at 1920x1080 resolution and 120hz monitor with no problem at all, the game felt smooth. Now the stuttering is so bad and I can especially feel it when a drag my mouse from right to left kinda slow... Feels like 60hz sometimes.

The only ""fix"" I got is to play at 1600x900 with 120 fps capped. But the game still don't feel the same, not so smooth as before.

Is there any solution for this?
Someone with similar problems?

I feel like it has fundimentally changed the game and definitely not for the better.

Where once you needed to think about your base in the end game, where you'd place it, how you'd build it, now you just hold down your build button and spam. So long as you have materials in many cases you are invincible until such time that you either run out, or if you speed build forward run over your opponent.

The same is true with collision building. Sure its great to be able to get to any chest easy or build anywhere, but the fact you can build through anything at any time means use of terrain in battles is useless. Where previously you might build with a tree behind your base to stop people building up easily, now they just build through it. Build next to rocks so they have to be broken down before someone can ramp? Not anymore.

I think the new build system is great in the sense that it is easy. But for me, it has taken away a very specific skill that people could become good at for advantage. Now there is no advantage to being a good builder, anyone can hold down build and spin to instantly have a base where before you had to actually feel under pressure trying to get the pieces into place.

I'm certain this will be an unpopular opinion and down voted but I really feel Fortnite has lost something with these changes, it has fundamentally changed the structure of the game in particular and to me it isn't for the better. It is a skill gap closure that really didnt need to happen.",FortNiteBR

Usually I am cool with accepting these because before people have said GG or perhaps wanted to squad up sometime or something.

Yesterday though I had two people add me after wins who right off the bat said something along the lines of ""wow you won using a noob luck shotgun, maybe you should use a shotgun that actually takes skill."" (Pretty sure both of these guys were pumpers who I killed in a shotgun battle with my tac)

The first guy didn't respond back when I asked him to explain what in the world he was talking about, but the second guy did. His response was ""you're terrible you rely on a shotgun that randomly does 200 damage and can shoot faster than the pump, broken piece of garbage.""

After this he ignored me so I was like whatever, but after my play session I tuned into Ninja's stream and noticed someone say the same exact thing in chat after Ninja died to a tac. Is this actually becoming a complaint now?

I have always been a tac user from this games release, I will literally take a green tac over a green pump just because I prefer the play style of having a faster shotgun. Even when everyone was running around with double pumps.

But thats just it though, its a trade off, you lose high damage at anything outside of being in someones face for a faster fire rate. The only reason I got 200 damage is because I got right in their face between their pump shots.  Just because the tac has a fast fire rate doesnt mean it shouldnt one shot someone in their face, I mean its a shotgun obviously it should kill in one shot to the face regardless of type cmon now.

And whats this whole deal with ""randomly does 200 damage,"" shotguns don't ""randomly"" do that much damage I would have to have the barrel literally in your face for that.",FortNiteBR

Then, slowly it started to be less strategy and more memes/showing people their great plays.  That’s cool I guess there was still some quality posts.

I didn't want to make a deal about it, but I decided to write a post after seeing this video: https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentMildShingleSoBayed?tt_medium=creation

This is Ninja calling a player a ""complete f****ng trashcan"" (he was gonna say ""retard"" but he contained himself) for CROUCH WALKING, a completely normal and, honestly, useful way of moving in Fortnite. He also identifies the guy who killed him as ""the worst player in the lobby"" because he crouch walked to a launchpad.

Isn't this the most toxic and obnoxious thing you can do in a community with lots of ""casual"" players?

This kind of elitist behaviour leads to a bunch of young men watching him in that moment, who are influenced by him and now think that crouch walking is something only bad players do. They may avoid doing it, or they'll fall in the category of players that their favourite streamer calls ""complete trashcan"".

Sorry guys, maybe this is only a rant post that benefits nobody, but i would really wish that in a community as florid and fun as Fortnite's, people would be allowed to play as they see fit, without anyone with that kind of influence stigmatizing in-game actions.

As I watched I felt more and more certain the guy was using mouse and keyboard as he went on to effortlessly win the game with 15 kills. The things that made me realise this was probably someone using mouse and keyboard were:

- Switching between weapons without any cycle (Assault rifle out, switching to shotgun, then sniper, then back to Assault rifle without handling the shotgun)
- Instantly building ramps, floors etc without any obvious delay (no cycling through)
- Insanely accurate mid air aiming to the right (very difficult / impossible to do on a controller as your fingers required to jump are also required to aim)
- Insanely fast aiming sensitivity which I don't believe is possible using controller

The guy was unstoppable. He out-built, out-aimed and outplayed everyone he encountered with ease. I mean, the guy was obviously a very good player, but I've watched some of the best PS4 streamers out there and there is no way they would have been able to keep up with this guy using a controller. Also, since the 60 FPS update and the input lag being mostly removed the upper limits of building have been increased beyond what is reasonably possible using a controller. The best players using mouse and keyboard appear to have a significant advantage over the best controller using players. 

I dunno, I've had my suspicions before but this is the first time I just sat there feeling a bit cheated. I'm genuinely curious though; why is mouse and keyboard an option on a console shooter again?",FortNiteBR

like other games developers they need to start off updating weekly or atleast twice monthly and to do that they need alot of money 

fortnite has been planned off for more than five years and we are still in the beta so i say wait a bit .. its just a start .... althought
i dont recommending buying alot of skins and emote since they dont increase accruacy or any special boosts they just are for fun same goes to gliders ..... but if you buy battle passes it will save you alot of cosmetic stuff ....soo 

also the save the world campaign is paid for some reasons and we know games like call of duty , battlefield , witcher 3 , far cry , etc have free campaign so why do you think they made save the world the true reason is that epic games forces us to play battle royale and buy cosmetic stuff but thankfully like gta v .. fortnite doesnt require ps plus .. but in xbox one you need xbox gold 
now moving on to will fortnite fall later on.. sadly... yes it will fall at some point at 2019 to 2020 due to microtransactions . cosmetic stuff and paid campaign

dont be triggered that fortnite will fall at some point .... also theres alot of free to win games like player unknownbattlegrounds 

also battle royale is now reaching on mobile like knives out and rules of survival

and suddenly in minecraft and roblox now feautures battle royale gamemodes in minecraft go to the hypixel server 

while in roblox theres this game called prison royale and its easy to win

First off, just let me say I am 100% behind the nerf that no longer allows you to skip the pump animation. It didn't make sense and shouldn't be how the gun worked.

That being said, the current state of the pump seems to have gone to the other side of addressing instead of what I would consider a happy medium.

Explanation: If you fire a pump and switch to a second pump that has not been shot yet, it requires another pump animation. See below video

Video: https://imgur.com/a/0Dm3i

Rationale: Per u/EpicEricSW comment and the patch notes this does not appear to be inline with the intended mechanic.

Comment:
&gt;If you fire the Pump Shotgun and quickly switch weapons, the next time it’s selected it will be &gt;forced to pump before firing again. This feature will only be enabled for Pump Shotguns, but we &gt;will closely monitor other weapon types for similar concerns.

Patch Notes:
&gt;Pump Shotgun behavior has been addressed. Firing the Pump Shotgun and quickly switching &gt;weapons will now require you to pump the Shotgun before the next shot.

The next time IT'S selected refers to the pump shotgun that was shot, it will require a pump. Currently this is working as ANY pump that is selected after firing one pump requires the pump animation. 

As for the patch notes, it says firing the pump and switching requires you to pump the shotgun before firing again. 

Now this for me is either 1 of 2 options:

1. This change was intended, but not explained correctly.

2. This change was explained correctly, but it is bugged and not functioning as it is supposed to be.

Has EPIC had any comments related to this?

I'm interested to what you all think!

The post then goes on to say “I didn’t switch to another pump so why do I still have to pump” PEOPLE. 2 pumps wasn’t the bug. The bug was the pumps animation being cancelled and the pump having such a fast fire rate due to this. It didn’t matter what other gun you had. You could “double pump” with just one pump shotgun and an axe. The exploit was people using 2 shotguns to stack ridiculous damage and never have to pump. THIS IS WHAT WAS FIXED. No matter what weapon you switch to when you switch back you will have to pump again. Please stop asking for epic to make it so you can shoot, go to build mode, leave build mode and then shoot again.

So you think cosmetics cost to much or that they should be free right? Well I am hoping to change your mind. So PLEASE bear with me as I try to explain why Cosmetics are the way that they are. 

My first point is that Cosmetics are Epics only source of income in Fortnite. (excluding STW) With this said they give players an AMAZING game as well as all the other perks I.e Updates (weekly), Support for players, and Communication. Epic has done an amazing job with Fortnite and they give it to everyone for free! That is incredible. So when they ask for 20$ for a well designed skin I don't think they are asking too much from us. You would normally spend 60$ at least if not more for a game of similar quality, and even then you still wouldn't get the great customer support that epic provides.

If you think that buying battle pass tiers should make it so they don't receive the same items that you do just because you **EARNED** it doesn't mean that those who purchased tiers didn't earn it as well! Those who purchased Tiers work their asses off so that they could enjoy the finer things in life, such as buying tiers so that they could get that cool John Wick skin early. I've seen several posts in this sub-reddit playing with the idea that if you didn't buy Battle pass tiers you'd get a cool glow or a extra item from the Battle pass. Which means players who bought the tiers would miss out on cool stuff just because they didn't want to grind and had the financial fidelity to purchase it. As I stated before these people still **EARNED** Their items, they just spent money and *THAT IS COMPLETELY FINE*

As a final note I would like to say that the people who buy these items and support the game make it possible for you to play it without spending a dime and that is not something that should be punished. In fact you should be grateful because without these wonderful people spending money on a wonderful game it wouldn't exist. So next time you see someone with a cool skin that you don't have why don't you try saying ""Thanks for supporting the game!"" **NOT** ""Look at that pay to win loser, he probably spent over 200$ on this game.""

Thanks for reading until the end, please let me know how you feel about this topic. I'd love to read what you have to say!

-In 23 games I’ve finished in the top 10 4 times, my best finish being 3rd, and been in the top 25 3 other times. 

My weak point is building, due to it being a new concept I obviously have had no experience with playing PUBG. 

**Strategy**

1. Land at the Wailing Woods, no matter what. 

2. Don’t immediately go on the house there, instead run around the maze and pick up a gun (typically there’s a shotgun there). Then find and kill the others while they’re searching for the guns you already have. (Most I’ve ever seen is 3 others)

3. Tear down the forest til you’ve maxed out on wood. 

4. If circle is on you then fortify the house in the Woods, sit on the first level with a shotgun and wait. 

5. If circle is off you then run like hell to it, then camp, but don’t build or engage in combat. 

5. Once circle starts getting fairly small build a 4x4 fort near the edge, going up about 4 stories. 

6. If you have a scoped rifle obviously keep poking your head out and trying to snipe, but if you don’t just stay there. 

7. Once the circle is getting incredibly small with at or less than 10 players then build a sky fort extending from the original base you’ve made. Make sure the ramp is at least 3 wide. 

8. Make it rain like hell on enemy bases. 

9. Hope for the best. 

I have very little experience but so far this has worked the best for me. If any of y’all have tips you’d like to share or comments on my strategy I’d greatly appreciate it! 
I get it tho if you want to keep your strategy secret. 

**Landing at the Tilted Towers is not a ~~good~~ strategy**


Edit: I’m good at firefights, my problem is building. Which is why I land in the woods, to easily collect resources. ",FortNiteBR

I decided to go drop in moisty at the crab because I hadn’t been there before. I get there and pick up a grey pump and green pistol that are underneath the crab, and as I do I see someone gliding in. So, I start shooting with the pistol. When they land they don’t try and run, instead they salute and excepts their fate. I’m like wow what a homie, and I stop shooting and drop them my grey pump. We both salute each other and we continue our separate ways. 

This is where the story takes a dark turn. 

About 30-60 seconds later, while i’m mining the crab, I hear building coming up the hill, and instinctively I turn and shoot at the incoming attacker. After the first two shots, which miss, they turn and run. As i’m taking the third shot, which ends up being a fatal head shot, I realize the skin is the same as the person I helped a minute earlier. I start getting a sinking feeling. I run to the loot and what do I see but some wood and two grey pumps. They were coming to return the grey pump back to me.

198,break_card,1519526112,801lih,22,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/801lih/10_tips_to_improve_your_game/,87,10 Tips to improve your game.,"Here are some quick tips that can help you get better faster.

1. **Most important. After every match, think about what you did wrong.** Why did you die? What did you take away and learn? For example, I launch padded behind someone only to realize I had med-kits out, and died panic-switching to my shotgun. I learned to always have my gun ready before hitting the launch pad to flank someone. This tip is the true engine for getting better.

2. **Crouch, stay still, and shoot in bursts.** This is suuuuper important with ARs. Crouching and staying still SUBSTANTIALLY reduces the bloom of the AR allowing it to hit far-away targets easily. Shooting in bursts reduces the recoil of automatic ARs. If you've ever wondered why your AR shots never land, this is most likely why. EDIT: Should note that you should not be crouched and still while you are at risk of being shot yourself. This makes you an easy target for headshots. Build some cover, briefly crouch, take some taps, then keep moving!

3. **Always be ready to build.** The quicker on the draw you are with your building the better you will be at defending yourself if you're shot in the side or the back. For console, always make sure your build is on the flat wall when running around, so you can quickly throw up a wall if you're ambushed and minimize damage to even the fight up.

4. **Highground is everything.** Always try to be above the person you're shooting. Looking down on somebody increases the chance you will get a headshot, increases the amount of cover you have, and decreases the cover they have. 

5. **Use building to your advantage in a shootout.** This is very important in short-range fights where 1 head shot can be the difference between life and death. Build over a person to get better chances of a headshot. Block their shotgun shots with a quick wall and throw them off. This is best learned by watching very advanced players play i.e. Ninja or TSM_Myth. 


6. **Learn to get to your destination as fast as possible off the battle bus.** Instead of thinking of how much time you will have to spend skydiving+gliding to reach your target, think about the earliest possible time in the game you can get to your location. Don't fly over mountains when diving or you'll deploy very high. Don't be afraid to glide early if you're coming up short. This one's very important if you're landing in highly contested areas.

7. **Don't run to the center of the circle too early.** This is especially important the longer the game progresses. If you're smack in the center of the circle you increase your chances of being gang-banged from multiple directions at once. You should be sticking more-or-less near the outline of the circle and waiting for people to run in from the storm, or engaging people who do run too close to the center. Setting up a fort in the middle of the circle is like setting up a lighthouse - everyone is gonna know you're there and you will get challenged by everybody. Stay low-key and don't attract too much attention.

8. **Choose your shots carefully.** Shots are a beacon in this game. People may be attracted by the sounds of your gunfire. Make sure you're prepared to defend yourself if you get shot from the side or back.

9. **Play aggressively and don't play to win, play to kill.** Tip 1 asks you to learn from your mistakes, so by extension the more mistakes you make, the faster you'll learn. See someone forted up? Build up there fast and shotgun them from above! Hear a shot ? Follow it! Land in named places more often. It might get frustrating, but each death will teach you something very valuable if you meditate on it. You'll feel yourself getting better at the game very fast. EDIT: Would advise against Tilted Towers as it's just too cramped and difficult. Shoot for places where 3-4 people usually land. 

10. **Learn what is worth keeping and what isn't.** From my experience, beginners tend to not gather enough healing supplies. Small shields are incredibly important to hoard - they can heal you for 50 in 4 seconds and you can stack 10. You can make cover and pop them mid-battle. Campfires are very useful for topping off your health. Med-kits are also great to have handy. Stockpile healing supplies early as they become harder to find as the game progresses. The only guns you truly need are ARs and shotguns.",FortNiteBR

For example: if I was using a tactical shotgun, I could shoot the tac, switch to my rifle, and back to the tac with no downtime.

If I were to use the pump shotgun, I would shoot the pump, switch to my rifle, and back to my pump and not even be able to fire.

I believe this is wrong because the nerf was for the DOUBLE pump. Not the pump in general.
I understand it is the way it is right because of pump-tactical switching.

My fix would be to remove the need to re-pump to only when you switch to another shotgun whether that is the tac or pump.

They kept saying they wanted to build a “sniper base” which I thought was funny. I convinced them if they saved their materials for when the circle was smaller that then we would build the coolest sniper base they’ve ever seen.

Eventually we got just east of Tomato Town entering Wailing Woods with about 10 people left and a very small storm eye centered on the woods. I told them it was time. We built a 1x1 brick tower up into the trees and expanded platforms out over the trees on every direction. We could hear violence breaking out under us and could tell nobody knew we were above them until it got down to just one other squad.

Luckily, a care package dropped right in our tree fort; I got a gold rocket launcher and gave one of the kids my gold mini gun. One of the kids pointed out an enemy base and I told them to tear it down. In a truly team effort, we eliminated the last squad and got these kids their first W.

They absolutely lost it screaming “FINALLY!”  It was so awesome seeing how excited they were and I was happy to have helped them accomplish this goal that not many Fortnite users can say they’ve reached yet this season. 

Not to mention this technique wouldn’t have been possible without the update to allow building around trees so thanks for that, Epic.

I’ve been thinking about everything it’ll take to get to tier 100 without paying 150 v-buck for another tier. Here is what I concluded:

100 total tiers with it taking 10 stars per tier
100 x 10 = 1000 stars needed

Tier 2 of battle pass gives you 5 free tiers so 5 x 10 = 50
1000-50=950 total stars needed

Now for adding up what you need to do:

Every 10 levels you get 10 stars (lvl 10,20,30 and so on)
10x10=100

Levels 5, 15, 25, 35 and so on give you 5 stars with there being 10 times you can get that
5x10=50

That leaves 80 other levels where you get 2 stars for leveling up
80x2=160

Now for the challenges:

Free tier challenge set gives 50 stars

Weeks 1-8 challenges give 50 stars
8x50=400 total stars weeks 1-8

Week 9 challenge gives you 40 stars

Daily challenges give 5 stars each so with around 70 days in the season, 70x5= 350 possible stars if every daily challenge is complete (there could be less days in the season but this is an estimate)

Adding up the totals:

100 stars for levels ending in 0
50 stars for levels ending in 5
160 stars for every other level to 100
50 stars for the free pass challenge set
400 stars for battle pass weeks 1-8 weekly challenges
40 stars for week 9 battle pass challenges
350 stars for completing every daily challenge in season

=

1150 total stars that can be earned in season 3 with only 950 needed to reach tier 100

If you got to level 100 and completed every weekly challenge, you would only need to complete 30 daily challenges to reach tier 100

This is a few days late, but here's this season's calculator to see how many daily challenges you need to do to hit tier 100 for that sweet John Wick skin. First I'll go over how to use the spreadsheet and then I'll detail how stars work in general for those who may not know.

[Spreadsheet found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16z1pRd9kuB_uvHwSOt6MyYkZ8UHHcBYeTgIusVCM_5c/edit?usp=sharing)

How to use:

1. I will not be opening this spreadsheet up to edit so please don't ask me to on Google. You need to either A) download the sheet to excel or B) save it as a copy on your own google drive.

2. Just fill out all of the grey boxes in the sheet. For the most part these are simply recording stats that you have on your sheet but there are 3 questions (whether you own the battle pass, whether you have finished today's dailies, and whether you'd like to use the level you are projected to reach rather than using level 100).

3. The output you're looking at is the green boxes. These tell you the tier you are projected to reach as well as how many daily challenges you need to finish to hit tier 100.

4. ""Projected Level."" Based on the experience chart to the right of the sheet I project what level you will be by the end of the season based on your current level and the number of days remaining. Keep in mind this is only an estimate since things like boosts exist and not everyone plays consistently.

5. Battle pass weekly challenges. You'll notice this sheet assumes you will complete all the weekly challenges if you own the pass. If you think that you won't finish the challenges then you can change the ""maximum stars"" to the right of the grey box to reflect that. This will decrease the projected stars from battle pass challenges and cause you to need more dailies.

How stars are earned (you need 990 to hit tier 100):

1. Stars can be earned by leveling. All levels ending in 0 (10, 20, etc) give 10 stars. All levels ending in 5 give 5 stars. All other levels give 2. This is a maximum of 308.

2. Stars are earned by weekly battle pass challenges (must buy pass). You can earn 50 per week except week 9 which is only 40. That's 440 total.

3. There is a ""tier 2 challenge book"" for free players who hit tier 2. This is another 50 stars.

4. Dailies are the final source of stars and the only one which cannot be completed at any time. Every day you get a new challenge (resets at 6PM CT) and completing that challenge gives 5*. Over a 68 day season that is a potential of 340 stars.

Let me know if anyone has any questions, if I got any math wrong in my sheet, or if anyone has opinions on how to improve the sheet or make it more clear!

Thanks to everyone who supported this last season!",FortNiteBR

So with the change of double pump, which i don't really understand, some thoughts came to me, and just want to share them with You guys.

Lets start with **my** opinion on double pump change, for me it wasn't necessary, because i think we all forgot that you have to exchange 2nd slot for this second pump, so for example you can't pick up sniper rifle cause you would have to sacrifice (for another example) big potions/medkit/bandages or whatever, which seems for me like a big deal. Talking about **big** things i understand that dmg is really high from the pump, you can even one shot somebody from very close range, but you are able to almost one shot people even with RPG, which seems kinda crazy that rare item for unlucky people can give u that big advantage, while everyone can find pump very easily, and there is some counters to that, you can disengage from that guy (yes, you can disengage from people in that game, crazy right?) , you can build up and kill him with that too, just like Myth said.

Talking about Myth, some streames ago, he was also laughing at people talking that double pump is op, while killing everyone with just RPG as i mentioned earlier(couldn't find clips of this, but i would say it was around month ago).

Last Word, in my opinion it's good that epic is listening to STREAMERS (cause part of community knows how it looked like with Paragon) but i don't really feel like they should change (cause **skilled** players were able to use it), something instantly cause one big streamer is literally crying and behaving in bad way because of this especially when he used it as well, (don't know about timelines, so not sure that he said anything like IM NOT GOING TO USE IT ANYMORE. and after that he stopped using it. So if im mistaken write it below), but you can find many clips of that on YT. Myth was always saying that there is counter to that, and i agree with him.

TL;DR I think double pump ISN'T OP but was just strong in **skilled** hands so changing that mechanic cause one streamer literally raged because of this isn't good idea. And you have to remember that you lose second spot for second pump, so you lose potentially potions/medkits/or other item, and you can counter this, like Myth was always saying it.

(**1 Unique gun of each Allowed in a slot**)?

Example: Assault Rifle | Pump Shotgun | Tactical Shotgun |Hand cannon | Sniper or medkits, slurp etc..
**That's how it should be and will be eventually there's no denying it**

Not:
Assault Rifle | Hand Cannon | Hand Cannon | Hand Cannon | Hand Cannon

I mean sure it still takes precision and aim in some cases, but nonetheless its set up for the inevitable changes to one Unique kind of type of weapon per slot, except 1 Pump and 1 Tactical allowed of course, since those work differently mechanically.

So why not just implement it already and instantly balance the game and see how it goes? instead of wasting time; going back and forth, and adjusting this and that to infinity.

I mean you're a great company but obviousness is not your strongest trait!

And sure it brings variety, but in all honesty implementing this would bring about an equal start of the game, it becomes more skill based, it becomes more technical, observant, you wouldn't have to take 4 free shots on yourself to figure out what another opponent would potentially have in its inventory, instead it becomes a fight of the strongest will survive mentality which is what fortnite is meant to be right?

So Next Patch perhaps?

Of course you would be able to disable this function if you think it would distract you in any way.

Today I melted a dude down to 5hp and he hit an absolute crazy Quicksnipe on me and killed me. I really wanted to compliment his snipe and tell him ""Nice Sniper shot""! 

It would be pretty cool if once you die a customizable 10 slots showed up which you could communicate with the guy who killed you. You could fill those 10 slots with Emotes you have already unlocked and also messages FortNite adds like (Nice Shot, Beautiful Snipe, Awesome Play, Congrats!, WOW, So Close, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!, and im sure much more quotes I'm too dumb too think of) I would absolutely solute anyone who gave me a compliment, and then probably get sniped in the face during the process :D 

And especially when you come in 2nd place, you can say something to the Victor, (Good Game!, $%!&amp;, NOOOO!, Great Play! Congrats! Outplayed :(, Did Not Expect That!)

When I enter a firefight my first question is always if I'm being shot by a shotgun. It feels like if shotguns at least came in a much higher rarity (say purple and above) one-shots wouldn't be so common. And that's the gist of my issue, one-shots. I spawn with a revolver in hand and get one shotted after landing a shot. Feels a bit unfair, but when it happens every game it changes how I play completely. I now just rush for the shotgun so I can get kills and survive. That's a side problem I have, but I don't care much to a address it. Basic point is I feel like shotguns are superior in almost all scenarios in those first few minutes and they really ruin any sense of choice. Why use an AR when I can use a pump? Why use a pistol when I can use a tactical? Anyone else have similar feelings? I'd list the reasons shotguns are superior to any gun in nearly all situations at the opening minutes, but I'm sure you've all experienced having 100 Health 50 Shield and being one shot. ",FortNiteBR

Can’t seem to hit a head shot no matter how carefully I aim, get shit on with full shield and health, shots don’t connect when I am positive I am on target (I assume this is the “bloom” thing everyone talks about?). 

Doesn’t matter if I land at Tilted or some out of the way place, i can’t seem to find a decent gun setup (I’m lucky to get anything better than a green AR). If I do happen to find a sniper, I can’t hit anyone most of the time because they’re bunny hopping all over the place and I’ve always sucked with snipers in any game anyway. Took me about 15 games to do the “eliminate 2 players with a sniper” challenge, mainly because I could never find a god damned sniper rifle. When i finally got one, I had both kills in under a minute (surprised even myself!)

Over 450 games and only 1 win (which was luck because I think the other guy fucked up) and only somewhere around 280 kills. When I do get to the end game, it’s usually only because I landed out in the boondocks and by the time I get to the circle, everyone is pretty much dead but i feel like I’m showing up to a gun fight with a butter knife. 

I’m getting a little better at building but always forget during a fight and by the time I get my shit together the enemy has built above me and pumped me in the head with a shotty while doing a 720 flip off the top of his ramp. 

Anyway, just felt like having a rant. I keep coming back for more punishment though because I actually do enjoy the game for the most part. I think Epic have done a great job despite the bugs.

I feel it would be balanced if the damage to players was more consistent, damage to structures was higher, but a much longer reload speed to discourage the rocket spam. 

Grenade launcher fire rate is incredibly high, the counter to every thing In the game currently is to build (except mini gun). However the grenade launcher negates that, as so many times I have built to deflect the shots only to have grenades spammed at me and explode through my building. Slower fire rate would balance this out. 

As these two weapons are end game specific weapons, I don’t see how it is practical, or good for game experience to make these drop from chests. Supply drop specific weapons would further increase their rarity, and make hem truly power weapons while leveling out the plying fields for the beginning of the game. 

Now I’m not gonna lie, I have been on the receiving end and user end of these weapons and it’s crazy to me that they aren’t complained about  more often. Especially since the people of this sub seem to enjoy complaining about EVERYTHING. I don’t want to see the weapons needed out of existence but rather balanced out for the health of the game. It’s ridiculous and entire team can have rocket launchers or grenade launchers that are so easily spam able towards any team they come across.

I feel that it takes away from the core element of the mode. By directing the attention to the already helpless player just to, as my team goes to call it, ""ruin their gaming experience"". The focus should be redirected at the rest of the team during a conflict. At this current point in the game it has gotten so bad that getting knocked down just feels like a waste of time, as you are most likely condemned to elimination shortly after anyways. I feel that it is currently one of the highest reasons to quit playing entirely, because it becomes increasingly frustrating to consistently get insta-eliminated in a game with friends (especially when the rest of your squad survives the encounter).

A solution to this could be as simple as providing a short period of invulnerability to a downed player as to actually give them a fighting chance to get revived. I believe adding this will be beneficial to the game, since players will be more inclined to direct the focus on rest of the enemy squad, which could make firefights that much more intense with the pressure that the enemy actually has incentive to push. This intern could even allow games to be completed slightly sooner. EDIT: Also I believe that this would give the incentive for squads work as a unit

EDIT: Before you say something dumb like get better or don't go down, First of all that's not even the point so just get out. Secondly I have 100+ hours logged on console and PC (not saying i'm the best but i'm not bad). 
THIRDLY AND MOST NOTABLY, consider the times of complete unluckiness (which is more than desirable).
An specific example of an extreme case would when the player hunting for the downed player is guaranteed elimination just to take you with them.",FortNiteBR

If you have two pumps in your inventory and shoot one, then switch to the other, you have to pump the one you haven't even shot yet. The fix was supposed to be to force you to pump a shotgun that has already been fired, not one that's fully loaded. Being able to shoot one shot from each pump shotgun was never the broken mechanic. It was being able to shoot multiple shots from each pump without repumping.

Also, you can't start reloading your pump until after you finish pumping it... And at the end of the reload animation, you pump it again. I'm all for fixing the double pump as it was incredibly broken and I am glad they changed it for the better. But it is still broken. I just want the shotguns to make sense. They don't need to be pumped multiple times to shoot one shot and they don't need to be pumped when they're fully loaded. Please make the pump shotgun make sense Epic.

So I recently played a few times in some small tournament in Poland sponsored by Logitech and I noticed really bad thing that ruins the whole experience of fighting in higher skill level which also bothered me before but I didn't notice it that much since u aren't really going to meet many good players in normal matchmaking. Straight to the point, I'm talking about how small amount of wood does trees give. When u are going to fight good players u are going to use lots of materials so it's a must to have resources to win every fight or atleast have any chance to fight against someone who has them but the worst thing about it is that u don't really have time to farm them. U have to worry a lot about circle movement and after u win a fight and spend all your resources u don't have time to harvest them because circle starts moving and u end up getting into it without any materials which puts u into big disadvantage if u are going to meet someone right after u get there. That's why I think that u should boost overall gain of materials from all objects (or atleast trees), it wasn't that noticeable before u nerfed pine trees. I know that was intented as a buff to other types of trees but I think u should've done the opposite - u should've kept the amount that it gave and buff the other ones by like 2x or even more.",FortNiteBR

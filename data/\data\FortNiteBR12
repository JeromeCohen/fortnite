I have been playing since the launch of this game and I've been seeing a trend since about Season 4-5 I guess, where people (I assume kids, not adults) are basically demanding the return of Season 1 exclusive skins.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am not the worst about this but I feel like people only want it to return so they can add it to the collection and not because they actually like it. I've seen this happen with Skull Trooper, where people used this skin and I knew it was someone from Season 1. In my experience it is more important to have some exclusive rewards from the beginning of the game than for everyone to feel equal.

&amp;#x200B;

I've seen maybe 2 or 3 Skull Trooper since he re-released because the skin became overused and died really soon after. I know Skull Trooper is not the same as Season 1 skins, and him returning was coming naturally because it was part of the Item Shop and not Season Shop, but it does show how it's more about greed from children than actual enjoyment/wanting a skin.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's be honest most people don't ""flex"" their skins but get called out to be flexers when using the skin. Season 1 of course won't come back but I feel bad toward the children expecting it to come back and being mislead about everything that's being shared by immature streamers and people who want to get some ""fame"".

&amp;#x200B;

Can we have a mature discussion about this? The majority of the playerbase consists of children, and I feel not enough attention is given to the subject.

I think an official statement from Epic Games would help in the situation really. I can't think of much else we can do, except report streamers/posts about this.

I am just as bad/ sorta good as the rest of you. But I have something to say to the rest of my fellow casuals...


You all need to grow the frick up. Seriously. What has happened to this sub? It's full of you all running around and down voting anyone who has anything to say that is in anyway different than the popular opinion. 


sOcCeR sKiN bAd, fIsHsTiCk gOoD, am I right? Remember back in December when Fishstick came out, the entire sub was shitting on it, down voting people who thought it was good. r/ShrineOfFishstick was a sub made by the Fishstick lovers (who liked it before it was liked by you all), and whenever they went onto this sub and said they liked Fishstick, they would be swamped with hate. Now, everyone likes Fishstick! Woopee! But everyone still hates soccer skins. Sure, most of the time getting killed by a soccer skin is triggering, especially when they are clearly better than you, but that doesn't deserve more than that. If you got killed by a Soccer Skin that was pro level, and then by a Black Knight in the next one, you would still be mad at the soccer skin. Why? Because the community has labeled Soccer Skins as terrorists, no matter their skill level. If they are soccer skin, they are toxic little craps, right? Yes it's frustrating when anyone who killed me BMs, but I don't see the skins of those people being shit on.


You all are calling the TTVs toxic, when in reality, you're just triggered that they're better than you! The people who make posts about getting hate messages from people they've killed are turning into those people, but on Reddit. Getting killed in game is PART OF THE GAME, you don't need to get triggered and call them a sweat just because they're better than you or outplayed you. Speaking of ""part of the game"", the Fortbyte/challenge problem! Someone killed you while you were trying to complete a challenge, or get a Fortbyte. Big deal! It's a **BATTLE ROYALE GAME** people are supposed to kill you. Ever wonder why challenges like finding a Battlestar was called a *challenge* besides from having to find the location? It's probably because you need to try and get it without getting killed. So if you're completing a challenge, but someone kills you before you can get over it! I get upset at people too when I get killed in that situation, but thats only in the moment and doesn't last. Shut up about respecting other players in a game like this, shooting people at all is disrespectful, so you have no where to insert that into a game like Fortnite, where the objective is to kill people. I mean, yeah be nice to your squad mates, but still,  you don't need to be respectful in this game to your enemies.


The casuals have turned into the toxic side of the community. They're trashing TTVs, skins, and other people just for killing them when that's what they're supposed to do. Anyone BMing can be triggering, but it's JUST A GAME. People **EVOLVE** when playing a game. It's almost been out for 2 years, so of course everyone is really good now. If I get down voted and this post gets hate, that'll prove my point even more on how toxic the casuals on this sub have become. To the kids especially, GROW UP.

Well, this is something that no one knows, BUT I want to heighten the experiences in you, because not only in my opinion but also in the opinion of many people who ... Renegade can yes return. Only, the question is, ""How do you know this?"", ""What proof do you have that she will come back to the game someday?""

Well, I do not know and I do not have proof for this, but I'm sure this will happen, why?

Facts that favor the return of Renegade and answer the question if it was exclusive:

\- She was a skin that was achieved in the Season 1 Season Shop, if it were exclusive all future seasons would also have the Season Shop.

\- You unlocked it when she reached Level 20 of the Season, but you had to buy her for 1,200 vbucks, that's another fact, because if she was totally exclusive everyone who got Level 20 in season 1 would have her.

Facts that prove she was exclusive of season 1:

\- It was unlocked for purchase when you reached level 20 by taking the fact that you have to buy it, it's like a category 20 skin for example, or that you had to get XP amount to reach it, however this is irrelevant ....

&amp;#x200B;

I am creating this post because I can not take it anymore, on the answer would be YES AND NO, there is a definite answer, however 99.9999999999999999% it was not ....

To be honest I'm considering quitting the game soon, but it keeps me coming back. I love this game and streaming it is great and a good time, but lately its become more and more painful. You just get on and dont know what to play. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the big issue I'm feeling at the moment:

&amp;#x200B;

Creative can be fun, but isnt that replayable for a long time, even with good friends. 

Public matches feel awful if you hot drop and then just dying to either poor RNG (legitimately no shotgun spawns right now) and no siphon. But they are too easy if you actually play the game smart and to win and dont hot drop.

Arena feels entirely pointless most of the time because no one actually cares about keeping 300+ Hype, and no one plays them seriously anymore, which makes you in turn not play seriously either. The players are better and there is siphon but something just feels off about it, like 300+ point games having 5 people in 6th circle.

The most fun I have is when I'm playing with a group of friends and even that gets stale. The current meta is absolutely terrible, the RNG is awful, and the game is filled with a lot of annoying things like the bow.

&amp;#x200B;

I really dont want to just whine here and add nothing useful in the conversation, but am I alone here or are a lot of people feeling this when playing the game? If you're having a lot of fun on FN right now, I dont want to poop on your parade, what are you doing to enjoy the game more?",FortNiteBR

Especially up in champions league where in late game, I can’t even move without seeing 10 players teleport around and builds not showing fast enough. Why has Epic not seen the flaw in this? You can’t force fairness because of how crappy consoles are. Why are you trying to make it fair for everyone when there’s already disadvantages in place. It makes no sense!!

Epic has the idea that more bad guns = easier for casuals. Which is absolutely untrue. The top players don't have to loot every chest they come across, they just get whatever guns they want by killing other players. The top players will always have the best loot by mid to end game. The only way to counteract this is to give the casual players MORE good guns to even the playing field. The lack of combat shotguns is an absolute nightmare and the most broken part of the game right now. Gold scars and tactical ARs barely even exist. Tactical ARs period barely ever drop. The best solution is to get rid of all the weapons that make you groan when they spawn from a chest. Opening ten chests just to have 15 bandages, a hunting rifle, grey AR, scoped assault, and a completely irrelevant grey tac -- its absolutely disgusting. I don't even hate the burst smg. I'd say it rewards good aim more than the regular smg. I also didn't mind the original burst AR for that same reason. But all these pistols and the grey tac need to be taken out immediately. Green variants of the tactical AR and combat shotgun need to be made available as well. The only reason the pump was removed was because someone with 2 health could hit a lucky shot and one-pump somebody for 200. I do agree with that being a broken mechanic, but I think they should still bring back the pump, just with nerfed one-shot capability. The tac is now nearly useless in the current loot pool. I love the new combat shotgun and don't want to see it gone, but it's distance could use some nerfing and it 100% needs a higher drop rate. 

TL;DR - replace trash loot like pistols(maybe keep dualies), scoped ARs, hunting rifles, and grey tacs with lower tier variants of the more functional weapons like the tactical AR and Combat shotgun. Bring back green-blue pump shotgun with nerfed one-shot capabilities so someone with 2 health can't get lucky and one-pump you for 200.",FortNiteBR

It seems to me that shotguns are nowhere to be found. If you find a shotgun, you likely won't find shield. The entire map can literally be traversed by the air if you do it right, meaning third parties can land on you at any time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Epic has gone out of their way to make the game easier for casuals, so I'm not entirely certain why they would make it easier for casuals to get third, fourth, and fifth partied by the nearest teams waiting to hop in a slip stream when they hear gunfire. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm truly a bit confused why the silenced smg, a gun that rewarded good aim and was very well balanced and liked by the community, has been replaced by an ugly burst smg that is almost universally disliked. I understand change is healthy, but taking out instrumental guns like the pump shotgun, that players have adapted to for literally years, is not good for the game (in my opinion, of course). I can't recall seeing anybody, *anybody ever* suggest that the pump should be removed from the game -- yet they just removed it like it wasn't a big deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then there's the combat shotgun. It's very fun to use, if you find one. Good luck finding one. If you have a pistol, a burst smg, a silenced pistol, a hunting rifle, or one of the many other useless (close range) weapons that come out of a chest... Well, you're ass out of luck when the guy with a combat shotgun finds you. RNG is to be expected in a Battle Royale, but RNG to the point where one can lose 10/10 fights off spawn, solely because they can't find anything useful to fight with, is just ridiculous. It's never been this bad. The loot pool is far and out in the worst state it's ever been. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, that leaves me wondering, are you guys enjoying this? Epic has to have a demographic in mind that they're catering to with these outlandish updates. Are they doing a good job?",FortNiteBR

It was only when he starting building 90’s and jumping off it while shooting the Hand Cannon and constantly making pop up window edits to try and snipe me that I realize what he was doing: He was probably trying to show off, probably trying to get a clip or something for some low effort montage reel. Needless to say I was quicker on the draw in the end and just one shotted him with my Combat Shotgun while he tried another window edit.

I’ve been playing Fortnite on a Switch for about 6 months now and the latest updates made the game unplayable, with the frame rate constantly dropping down to 10.

I’m planning on getting a PS4 and my question is, which version should I get if I just plan on playing Fortnite (Slim/Regular/Pro)?

What’s the average FPS on the Slim? Regular? Pro?

For the average to advanced player, all 3 shotguns would be a viable option to carry. I'd personally have a hard time picking between a pump and a combat given the choice. 

Why the double barrel? This could replace the tac. Its has a large spray area that would be good for beginners that don't have the best aim yet. Its also a viable gun off drop that would compete with any other shotgun.

These 3 options also introduce the player to adopting different strategies. 



The combat- longer range but does not one-shot, quick fire rate

The pump- one shot possibility. Slower fire rate opens up a need for switching to an smg or spray weapon. 

Double barrel- 2 shots, long reload. Must get up close and personal.

Welcome to Murphy's laws of Fortnite, for all modes!


1. At any point in the game, shit might happen on a way you can't do shit about it other than grumble at the game.
2. Every time you land, you'll have your gun snatched by some kid even if you have auto-pickup on.
3. If you find a gun, it'll always be the worst guns you can find early.
4. Every chest before you land might have a shitty sniper rifle.
5. You'll find nothing but ammo and a shitty pistol in one house while the kid in the other house found 4 Tacs and 6 minis.
6. You'll always lose early game fights to some kid spamming M1 and Spacebar with a tac even if you outbuild them no matter what is your loadout.
7. Drum guns miss every shot if you have one, and never miss if you're not holding it.
8. You'll always get yourself trapped in your own build and shot by 4 different players even if it's not even worth it to them.
9. If you ever find good guns, you'll use up all ammo, get no kills, and get pickaxed or shotgunned.
9. Squad fill will always be unreliable.
10. There will be always a kid AFK on your squad fill that only comes back late after the bus is already gone, dies and quits.
11. Every random that gets knocked quits instantly despite reboot vans _existing._
12. Every random timmy out there thinks they're the GOAT and tells the team to drop hot, gets everyone (and himself) killed and quits before we can even regroup.
13. There will always be a non-english speaker either with a mic open putting more static than an AM radio, or talking incessantly to his family members and overall acting as if PTT isn't a thing.
14. Your squad members will waste time and LOADS of ammo trying to kill a knocked guy while you get rushed by 2.
15. Someone will always snatch every gun and never give you one, leaving you defenseless.
16. Squeakers will always demand to be given V-Bucks, despite that being literally impossible.
17. If not, they'll be decent, but will talk incessantly and overdescribe everything.
18. Someone will always be behind looting everywhere trying to find a better gun while the squad is already moving somewhere else, often attracting enemy squads.
19. Your team will always lose even a 3v1 against someone playing with a steering wheel if you ever get knocked.
20. Often there will be a literal little newbie that installed the game 10 minutes ago and doesn't even grab guns. More than often, it's the entire squad.
21. People will land far away from the team thinking they're hot shit, die instantly, then quit.
22. The moment you peek even if you clearly have an advantage you'll be sniped even if your shot goes off first.
23. Every maniac with a Tac will phase through every single wall you make and kill you.
24. If you ever try to engage someone who's distracted, more than often they're a god and will destroy you for daring to disturb their farming.
25. Loot goblins will be there every damn match.
26. Every AR early game runs out of ammo before killing one person.
27. You'll always find a better version of your nearly ammo-less weapon AFTER you've already reloaded.
28. Even if everyone is decent at the game, you'll still be wiped by total bots.
29. Every default who's currently a Banshee will always finish you even if your entire team is shooting them in the head.
30. You'll always get lasered from long range by someone with 100 sens.
31. If you ran a looong time to get away from the storm, the next circle will be even further away.
32. There will be no healing items for miles.
33. The noobiest teammate is always the one to be shot first even if they don't look like it.
34. Someone will always find a Heavy Sniper early and be decent enough to get rid of you early game by luck.
36. If you are decent at the game, you'll always be shat on by a streamer who will call you a bot, and in their perspective, they're right.
37. If you are an average player, you'll always be found by a TTVer who will proceed to be toxic.
38. If you're good at the game, you'll always choke against someone with half of your kills who managed to be smarter.
39. Third parties always wins.
40. If you try to third party, you'll probably die.
35. All of the above can happen in one game.

I had an epic gamer meltdown a few weeks ago. I was bored shitless of Fortnite after predominately playing it for a year and a half, so I decided to purchase PUBG on Steam. I played it for an hour and a half and got bored of it. In my *personal opinion*, the graphics are terrible and the gameplay is incredibly slow and an utter briefest. 

I proceeded to go back to Fortnite. Ever since then, I haven’t looked back. I’ve come to acknowledge that Fortnite is the game for me.

I love the art style. I have *never* spent as much money on cosmetics as I have with Fortnite in my life. I love the cartoonish skins and the overall style of the game. It keeps me engaged. The game is appealing to look at from a visual perspective, and it keeps me loading up again and again. 

In my personal opinion, Epic cracked the code with building. It is incredibly addicting and offers multiple gameplay avenues. I am always striving to become better at building and it keeps me playing because I *want* to be the best I can be.

I’ve called Epic out on numerous occasions for their dumbass decisions, and I will continue to do so. But am I quitting this game any time soon? Fuck no. I’m hooked.",FortNiteBR

I also know that some people have said it is due to the Battle Eye Launcher, and that when the game starts with Easy Anti Cheat it runs better.

What I'm wondering is if there is any response from Epic AT ALL on this? I don't see anything on their Trello page for community issues. And I saw a tweet saying that with the last client update there would be an additional download for people having fps issues. Client update came and there was no additional download for me.   
I also had consistent 144 fps before this btw, so I know it's not hardware/software because I've tried fixing that as well and still have the same issue. Tried reporting in game but it just seems like Epic doesn't give a shit. I would like to know at least if they're investigating/working towards a fix.

&amp;#x200B;

The pump was vaulted because it accounted for 26% of all kills, and that makes sense, you practically needed a pump to be able to even make top 25.

But in my opinion, currently the combat is even more so needed than the pump ever was. I'd better my college funds that the combat accounted for close to or more so than 26% of kills and that's why the drop rate was nerfed. The combat can shoot over twice as fast as a pump, so you don't need a switch off weapon, so there's no way it didn't account for just as much.

There's virtually no point of the burst smg (not to say that it isn't a good gun), when you have a shotgun that can two tap in a matter of seconds and shoot you from 100 m and still do damage.

&amp;#x200B;

# Epic wants ""to keep the game freeesh,"" Epic wants ""diversity?""

* **There's no diversity in having two shotguns that shoot fast.**
* **There's no diversity in having 2 times as many snipers, when the main part of a loadout will always be a shotgun.**
* **There's no diversity in vaulting weapons unnecessarily, when there's barely any weapons in that class.** 
* **There's no diversity in nerfing the drop rates of the good weapons that give you a fighting chance. (dual pistols, combat shotgun)**
* **There's no diversity in nerfing good guns into the ground, to the point they aren't used anymore so they'll eventually be vaulted. (burst ar, heavy ar, revolver)**

&amp;#x200B;

# I always say I had the most fun in season 3, not because of nostalgia, but because there was more variety.

The tac shotgun was at the time inferior to the pump but still a good gun because it had it's 2.5 headshot multiplier (head shotting for 165,175,185), while we still had a pump that could one shot. 

The heavy shotgun was just introduced, and even though it didn't one shot, it still did good damage at range and it shot quick.

The deagle was just introduced, and even though it did less than it should have at range, it could've still been used in a loadout.

The revolver was still good, and we had two smgs that were both good.

But some vaults later, and an increased amount of ARs, (the only thing Epic can consistently keep diverse (believe it or not, at one point in time we had 8 assault rifles)), we're at the point where what we need, is almost impossible to find, while we have to walk past 5 bursts and 6 silenced pistols.

&amp;#x200B;

# TL;DR: We don't need non-stop rotations of weapons out of the game for a fresh experience, each game would be a fresh experience if we didn't have to land and find the same guns over and over again. 

# Each game would be a fresh experience if we had multiple guns that were good, instead of just one dominating a specific category.

# Each game would be a fresh experience if we could have our diversity back.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

As someone who has been paying since season 2/3, I’ve seen most of the map changes, specifically locations leaving us. I often reminisce about my times spent at these locations. Anarchy Acres, Flush Factory, Risky Reels, Lazy Links, Moisty Mire/the prison, Wailing Woods, Greasy Grove and any other ones I may have forgotten (I’m not counting Tilted, Retail, Dusty Depot because they’re still there, it’s just different versions of them.

So I was thinking, it’d be really cool to have another unvaulted event where we all vote to unvault one of the fallen locations. I know it might be hard to do with the map changes kind of telling a story but I think Epic could make it work and I just thought the concept of bringing back a location that is no longer in the game that was once near and dear to our hearts would be pretty cool.

I just want to play a game of Fortnite &amp; have fun for once. What happened to the Epic Games that listened to the community in season 2/3? Did the team change or what? Why can't you listen to the community? Say what you want, the competitive scene is a complete meme, letting cheaters in qualify &amp; not banning them. Other games would permaban a cheater if he got caught in a tournament &amp; not just 14 days. The game has soo many issues that aren't acknowledged &amp; it is becoming annoying at this point. Taking everything that gets changed &amp; everything can't last forever, why am I even making this post if I'm ok with the state of the game? 

**THE LOOT POOL NEEDS TO CHANGE**

I can't be the only one thinking that finding a gray AR from every 3rd chest is fun? The pool is cluttered &amp; needs serious changes. There are too many AK's from chests &amp; finding a shotgun is a quest. More often I'll find a gray tac &amp; my opponent will have a combat shotgun next to me. Shotguns however they feel, they will always be an essential &amp; important part of your loadout but the current shotgun spawn rates are horrible. Besides that, everyone is interested in the kill % of the Combat Shotgun, it must be really high. Shield spawn rate is messed up again, siphon solved that but let's not get back to that as I am sick of talking about siphon &amp; why it was good. I either find 20 minis in 1 house or I find no shields at all. They need to drop more often, especially when all weapons at this point are spam weapons. 

**The reasoning of not adding an FOV slider is a total joke**

You care more about your viewership instead of the actual community who plays the game. ""Pro players were forced to play on stretched res."".. NO, nobody was forced, it was totally optional &amp; ok as it was, everyone is FORCED right now to play on a HORRIBLE FOV of 80. There are plenty of videos talking about how bad a low FOV is bad &amp; how it should be 90. FOV SLIDER  ≠ STRETCHED RESOLUTION. Increasing the FOV would give you a better view &amp; I am sure every viewer would like to see more around a players perspective instead of seeing 50% of the skin covering the screen &amp; not being able to see its toes. FOV slider is on native but changes the view of your character, nobody is forced to play on a FOV that YOU BELIEVE IS HEALTHY for the game WHICH ISN'T. Players would play on what they prefer &amp; what benefits them the most - EVERYONE would be able to choose their FOV. My FOV is too low? Ok, let's increase it, too high? decrease it! If little Timmy gets pwned by someone having an FOV of 120, he can put the same FOV &amp; be on the same level as the guy who killed him, everyone has preferences. Please, this current FOV is horrible, either add an FOV slider or just increase the default one to 90/100...

**FIX LAG SPIKES &amp; FPS DROPS, PLEASE!**

Ever since season 9 started, I &amp; many others have started experiencing fps drops every early game. 5/10 games, I've died early game because my game freezes &amp; drops fps, I mess up my drop &amp; I get killed before I even have the chance to pick up a gun (I land on a gun &amp; my game freezes &amp; someone else picks it up). Please fix this, this is something that everyone would appreciate &amp; like. I can't even lose &amp; say ""I lost because I'm bad"" because I lost due to something out of my control.

**The competitive/hardcore/tryhard (whatever good players) scene isn't happy &amp; they're boycotting**

Because of the reasons above &amp; many more, the pro scene is boycotting with pub stomping so Epic responds for once. They're doing it because they believe when they destroy little Timmy &amp; do the L dance on him, he will eventually quit &amp; over time many bad players will quit &amp; epic will need to respond. I noticed the change as every end game I get pwned by a 15 kill soccer skin, both in Solos &amp; Squads. The community isn't happy epic, we appreciate your work for new locations &amp; new mechanics (Slipstreams, etc.) but just because you add new stuff doesn't mean the community is happy. I know reddit doesn't represent anything the actual Fortnite fanbase is, but anyone who can think will agree on stuff like this. Please, add a poll system so you can get more precise answers for your new additions. For example, everyone in game will get to vote on Do they want an FOV slider &amp; why? The game is unfun as it is like this, it's all about spamming, it doesn't matter how much you try to help little Timmy win, it won't matter. Would you rather please a casual who is bound to quit after 2 games or the fanbase who supports you &amp; plays the game even with these horrible changes! Thank you, disagree if you want, downvote me if you want, I am tired of these things at this point.",FortNiteBR

I loaded my game up on my phone again and that has all my progress as it should be. 

I’ve tried to log in to my epic games account but due to not remembering the password I have tried to reset the password but I haven’t received any emails yet (typing this 45mins after trying). 

I’m just confused more than anything, I did merge accounts when it was available so I could log in on my phone when away so I’m thinking maybe it has something to do with that?

When epic games removed the Pump Shotgun and replaced it with the Combat Shotgun, they said this was because the Pump was simply too dominant in the meta, and was overshadowing other viable options. However, the Combat Shotgun currently is having the exact same problem. My proposal for a balanced shotgun meta involves some buffs to some existing shotguns, some vaults, and some unvaults, to provide a diverse range of shotguns to choose from, without any one being too overpowered. 

Change 1: Vault Combat Shotgun

- The Combat is really powerful. Too powerful. The Combat combines every good single feature you would want in a shotgun into one: range, fire rate, high damage, high capacity, fast reload. It just does to much and is way too much of a go-to weapon. 


Change 2: Tactical Shotgun fire rate increased from 1.5 shots per second to 2 shots per second, Epic and Legendary Tactical Shotgun added dealing 83/87 base damage. 

- The Tactical Shotgun hasn’t been a viable weapon since it was nerfed all the way back in season 4. A buff to its fire rate and higher tier variants will mean the Tac would be a powerful shotgun option to use late game. 


Change 3: Unvault Pump Shotgun, reduce damage from 95/100/105/110 to 80/85/90/95, now fires 5 pellet spread instead of 10, with minimum damage of 2 pellets. 

- The Pump will now be a viable option for chunking off large amounts of damage per hit, but will now no longer be able to one-shot. The spread reduction means the pump will also be much more consistent, and will deal more damage for less-centered hits. 

Change 4: Unvault Heavy Shotgun

- The Heavy is an interesting weapon, as it’s a sort of hybrid between the Tac and the Pump. Adding in the Heavy will further diversify the loot pool, while still not shifting it to one clearly superior shotgun.

So first I want to talk about something .. 
Not unlocking certain things in the allocated amount of time ... 
I didn't unlock the elite agent in time .. 
I was tier 77 I think and I was 11 tiers away .. I am devastated that I wasn't able to unlock it's always been one of my favourite skins .. 
I was doing exams or something and I came back on to find it's the season 4 update .. I really wish Epic could do something to make us unlock it again .. 
I really want it .  
So maybe the should do something called battle pass overtime .. 
It's gives us a option for each battle pass you didn't  complete .. you can pick only one and the challenges are really hard .. it's only available to people who purchased any battle pass and didn't unlock .. including the season 2 which I'm not gonna lie required a lot of grinding ... 

Please Epic .. I would jump off a building a land on a needle for the elite agent and trusty no#2 ( figuratively speaking but still ) 

Next point : please reduce the emoticons on the battle pass .. 

I look into my locker and there's like 90 emoticons or possibly more ... I don't need them ..in fact the only one I use is the F one from season 7 .. ( that was a cool one ) 

Each season we got something new .. 

Season 2 we received the battle pass and emoticons 

Season 3 .. we got loading screens , back blings , contrails and more . In season 4 we got sprays , in season 5 we got toys , in season 6 we got pets and music packs and season 7 was the last new thing .. which were  wraps . Now in each of those seasons those new things took up the slots of potential emoticons .. which is awesome .. 
My personal favourite were back blings ! 


Anyway what I'm trying to say is please introduce a new thing next season . 


Skin ideas : 

Since we got Frozen legends , Lava legends , Fallen love ranger and inferno .. I thought we could get two new packs for the future theme this season .


Legacy Legends 

Futuristic Ravage ( ravage with white and purple colours , metallic look ) 


Futuristic Wings 
( Metal feathers , white and purple ) 


Futuristic Vanguard 
( Dark Vanguard but instead it's white and orange and purple .. has a metallic look instead of a glossy look ) 

Futuristic Void 
( This is isn't actually a reskin of the original back bling ..  it's different reskin of the ominous orb , metallic white colour with purple effects ) 


Futuristic Flyer : Totally new glider , not a reskin this time .. 
It is similar to the Milano though .. it comes out of a rift when it deploys and it has blue sparks and it looks like the deep space lander .. it's white and purple .. 



This set would sell well .. I hope epic reads this .. 

Please share this and if you are please give me credit ! 
If you do design the concept you can take credit but you have to mention me as the original idea ..  
I don't mean to be rude .




Now something like the Inferno / fallen love ranger pack ... 

This one is my idea .. except the skin .. someone had the idea of the skin and I has the idea of the challenge pack .. the pickaxe and the back bling .

Neon knight challenge pack .. 

Comes with neon knight 
Neon shield 

Neon Axe 


And 1500 vbucks worth of challenges",FortNiteBR

(Didn't help obviously) Tried setting all game settings to low and still nothing. This PC is brand new and not even a month old so I am VERY aggravated that I can't play the game that I play almost every day and might have to just quit playing because you guys at Epic obviously don't know what you're doing. I have a lot of respect for you guys and what you do, but this has been occurring for almost 2 weeks and it's still not fixed?!?! That's unreal. PLEASE Fix this soon!",FortNiteBR

Proof 2. to make the game more rng they have added the burst smg which relies completely on a players bloom instead of their actual aim.

proof 3. added slipstreams so players with a weaker game sense don't have to worry about map placement.

proof.4 Arena mode is a trap for experienced players making regular games easier for new players.

We foutght for five minutes and the storm ate us. I hope you read this and friend me, but even if you dont, other people can read it and smile. 

We landed alone you and I in the large southern building. You beat me to the smg on the balconey and tagged me, but I ripped you with a pistol I found inside. You hit me with a fuckin boogie bomb and then burned through your mini gun ammo chasing me. 

We seperated, found heals and guns and mats, and fought again at the giant tree. We tried for high ground but both ran out of mats, we broke each other's shields and seperated, looking for more shield. We exchanged fire and explosives in the northern street, and then we fought a fourth time in the corner closest to the bridge.

We turtled, each using bandages and as the storm arrived we edited out and fought a running gunfight north. You took the high ground on the hill, but I had more mats and ammo. We clashed for a final time at the gas station, we both knew the fight was at its end. We ramp rushed, you beat me, I pyramided over you and you tried to trap me but I saw it coming and slipped out the back. I built up to the top and we were both of us out of mats as the storm ate us. I gambled and tried to jump and get you with my tac. I landed my shot but not cleanly, you got me in mid air with a hand cannon and I died. With a second of killing me the storm ended you.

I used to the think Siphon was bad but now I’m not so sure. I’m strictly speaking of health per kill not materials per kill. These are the two arguments I see:

For: 
1. Makes third partying harder 
2. Rewards aggressive play style
3. Easier to take down multiple opponents in squads or duos.

Against:
1. Increasing skill gap. (Harder to kill someone who has more hp.) 
2. Increases thirsting. Not really as bad of a problem now with reboot vans but still encourages it.

Not sure:
1. Makes the game more luck based.

Analysis: Siphon rewarded good play and I believe epic should do this. Trying to decrease the skill gap every update could kill the game. I have gotten the most ridiculous wins without Siphon with 0 kills since the others died in the storm. I believe that Siphon is more important in Squads or duos since taking on more opponents at once is harder. 

In solos really Siphon is there to avoid third partying. I do see the argument that as a battle royale you have to be prepared for third parties and it’s part of the game. Often with 5 slots carrying meds is a gamble so Siphon takes away from this problem, which I think makes fortnite unique. It makes for the luck aspect that bloom already gives. I do like this about fortnite bc it never gives you a guaranteed win. 

Conclusion: Siphon seems useful for aggressive playing styles. It takes away though from the luck factor which fortnite is based on. I would prefer for it to return to squad/duos, but not sure for solo.

normal clear sky is just how the game is now -base of all weather- (Happens very very often.)

&amp;#x200B;

cloudy would be a completely cloudy sky -aesthetic- (Happens decently often),

&amp;#x200B;

rain would be a completely cloudy sky with rain and sound effects for rain -aesthetic- (Happens pretty often),

&amp;#x200B;

flooding would have water puddle up at low spots, it wouldn't go past an average character's knees and wouldn't change movement speeds -aesthetic- (happens somewhat rarely),

&amp;#x200B;

a tornado would act as something you could jump into and it would blow you upwards to glide somewhere much like the airship airways, the sky would be completely cloudy and sometimes it will rain. -aesthetic and gameplay impact- (happens somewhat rarely),

&amp;#x200B;

a thunderstorm would knock down trees which would leave wood where they fell. -aesthetic and gameplay impact-  (happens somewhat often),

&amp;#x200B;

a hurricane would uproot trees and have them fly into the ground and destroy smaller buildings in unamed areas. -aesthetic and gameplay impact- (happens very rarely),

&amp;#x200B;

a tsunami would have the ground shake for a little under second and a giant wave would hit one of the sides of the island, it would make it about halfway across Lonely Lodge going from right to left in terms of travel distance on land. It would destroy smaller buildings in unamed areas. -aesthetic and gameplay impact- (happens very rarely)

&amp;#x200B;

With this season we have reached the highest speed chance to move around the island. Before this, you decided to remove +50 health after kill because player were becoming too aggressive. Guess what... aggressiveness hasn’t diminished AT-ALL... I think it is even greater than before🥴. Which is fine, I love aggressive game. But without the chance to gain health after kill, plus the crazy chance to move around everywhere like superman, it is all messed up. I get pushed in every mode (solo, duo, squad) so many times in a row that all the fun in the game is turned into stress, impotence, anger... why?? Because we are not rewarded for winning a fight, that maybe you didn’t even try to start! Plus: new shotguns are not that strong to finish a fight fast, so you need more mats. After 3 or 4 fights in a row it’s hard to still have mats left. So that’s the problem. Plus: you diminished the drop rate of shotguns, which is incredibly unnecessary, so it’s even hard to defend yourself from a push starting from your weapons.

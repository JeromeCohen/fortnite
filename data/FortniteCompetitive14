I think that it should be a 5 hour tournament, but games start every half hour (ten games total) In that way, all games can be played, so W keying is as viable an option.

Finals:
top 100 from each region compete in the same format: A 5 hour tournament, each game starting every half hour, maybe with a break in the middle. In this way, people will qualify for worlds who are actually good in a lobby with 100 of the best players in their region.

Arena is consistently getting worse and worse with champs players having no goal to grind for.

HOWEVER, in Asia, there is only 2 types of players can mostly dominate the scene in Asia. Koreans and Japanese. Why you ask?? First of all, every SINGLE Fortnite events, pop cup or recently the world cup, the server region for Asia is Japan, Tokyo. Since the Koreans and Japanese are SUPER close to the server they get good ping, around (0-20). Due to this, SEA (Southeast Asia) players play in these events with 100+ ping which is unplayable and unfair, since the Fortnite World Cup stated ""Asia"" but it mean ""Korea and Japan"".

With pros like Xil  adding ""fov slider"" to their in game name and 72Hrs/Vivid/Cloak/Thwifo changing their names to different variations of IIIlllIIlIlIIlII (which makes commentary more difficult), Epic is bound to notice that their game is going in the wrong direction.

A lot of bots/casuals watch these qualifiers and Epic would not want ""fov slider"" in everybody's name on presentation (just imagine it, lol).

If they truly want the best of the best they should take the cumulative or average scores of your best 5 weeks.  The reason why I say 5 for solo and 4 for duos is to allow you to miss a week if needed. 

This would truly bring out the best players.  Do you want the player or team that had the best week of their life? OR do you want the players that can consistently score in the top 100 week in and week out? 

I know this is a hard pill to swallow for some people that aren't consistent but if we as a competitive community want to see the best players then this is how it should be.  

I also understand that devoting that much time to one tournament seems excessive but if you really are a top player you will be playing in every one of these anyway. 

You would still need to qualify every Saturday and Compete on Sunday.  Then at the end of the 6 weeks they take the average of each teams best 5 scores and thats how we get the top 100 teams. 

Regions would still be locked, and the amount of people per region would be the same.

I said I felt similarly. It had become a stale, frustrating experience once we 'hit our wall' and felt we could not progress any further.

I have since reflected on some of the replies we received. The most helpful suggested approaching Arena with a different mindset. For instance, if struggling with early game, just keep trying to assert yourself and win your drop. Play to learn rather than just to accumulate points.

I've since tried to apply this mindset, and immediately the experience was so much better. I played very aggressively early game a few times in a row, and lost about 10 points in the process. I then climbed straight back up with a 14 point win.

I'm now fluctuating between 240 and 260 points. I've stopped worrying so much about getting any further, and immediately the experience is more enjoyable and rewarding. In other words, I'm playing at my natural rank - exactly how a ranked mode should work!

For all that's currently wrong with the game (believe me I'm fully on board with those complaints), I want to rescind my previous comment and tell Epic that I am appreciative of Arena mode. It is a positive development that came from listening to community feedback.

To all those other intermediate players out there for whom my previous comment resonated, try bringing a different mindset to Arena. Don't stress too much about points. Play, first and foremost, to have fun and learn.

Good luck out there xoxo",FortniteCompetitive

In my opinion, the competition should be about landing first, getting kills off spawn, rotating effectively and hitting your shots. Instead, it is about being lucky enough to find good guns off spawn, ballers, good zones etc.

So, these are the changes I would love to see:

\- Everybody should land with a full loadout of their choice including guns, heals,  some materials, 4 traps, 2 launch pads and 3 campfires. This is to reduce chances of losing due to lack of good guns off spawn and unlucky looting.

\- Chests and vehicles (including ballers) should have a 100% spawn rate. Again, to reduce chances of losing due to being unlucky.

\- Ballers should auto-destroy as 3rd/4th circle closes to make it a fair late game for everybody.

\- Players should be informed about the 2 next zones, not just one like in pubs.  This is to encourage strategic positioning.

\- This is a weird one, but I want to see how things change when you can destroy your own wall to get 5 materials back.",FortniteCompetitive

I've never been ""TTV Sweat"" level but I would consider myself the step below that level of skill. Anyway, I started today at 275 and can't seem to get out of the 270-280 bracket. I drop my normal drop location every game and either sweep through the players that land with me or get absolutely shit on even when i have the better loadout. The games I do make it to late game i feel like I struggle and choke shots I shouldn't miss mainly because of the intense battles around me and the constant movement of the zone with 20+ players left. I have koovak's and use it every day before I get on to practice my aim and it helps a little bit but other than that I don't really do any warmups.

Fortnite started like that back when there was no speedy way to get around the map, no third party‚Äôs, little-to-no skill gap, and a generic loot pool. But with the path of development fortnite has taken, that thrill you get from survival is barely apparent, and now feels more like a 100 player free for all where aggressiveness is the go-to play style. The game pace is fast now, partially due to the amount of mobility items in the game but also because of play style to which players have adapted (drop hot spot and rush for kills). Ever since fortnite began to add special items, ever since players began to realize the complexity of the game, ever since players stopped enjoying survival and starting enjoying getting into fights, this whole evolution and pathway has been obvious‚Äîor so I thought.

The V 8.20 update left virtually the entire community upset. And rightfully so, since epic‚Äôs goal was inconsistent with everything they have done to the game in the past 5 seasons. Players, as aforementioned, have adapted to an aggressive play style, and fortnite has met our desires at every moment. The 8.20 update suddenly made us take a step back. We had, for a while now, started to find joy in pushing fights and stepping into battles, but apparently that was unhealthy for the game. That leads us to where we are now. 

Nearly the entire community wants siphon back in the game, and it would make sense, considering how ballers, hover boards, quads, rifts, launch pads, balloons, redeploys, volcano vents, zip lines, and impulses make it easy to third party fights within seconds, leaving players who get in fights helpless.

To sum all of this up, the reason I think the removal of siphon was a bad choice is because fortnite has made it too easy to play aggressive and players have naturally adapted to an aggressive play style, becoming the new source of joy in the game. Joy in fortnite isn‚Äôt from survival anymore, it‚Äôs from getting kills and fighting. Which is why removing the reward for winning fights has made everyone so frustrated and upset.

I think fortnite should adapt to the path they were on. Aggressiveness was fun. Getting tons of kills was fun. Big battles were fun. The entire community liked it. And honestly, I don‚Äôt think fortnite would lose many players (or revenue, which they seem to care about more than anything). I have a lot of friends who enjoy playing the game for fun, the kind of players you‚Äôd call ‚Äúcasuals‚Äù who people think didn‚Äôt like the boost in aggressiveness that siphon brought about. But exactly the opposite seems to be true the more casual players I speak to. Yeah I get it, this is just my experience. But I haven‚Äôt heard of even a handful of players who disagree with siphon.

So what‚Äôs the deal? Does fortnite just not realize this? Or do they know something we don‚Äôt?",FortniteCompetitive

I personally think it takes very little skill to execute, is a massive competitive advantage over controller players, and is very noticable when playing arena. 

To put things into perspective, for a controller player there are 3 seperate inputs to reset an edit (edit mode, reset, confirm), whereas kb&amp;m it takes 1 input (flick scroll wheel). With extra inputs comes more chance to make a mistake, while also adding time to complete.

I understand that kb&amp;m has a natural competitive advantage over controller in a number of ways, I'm just curious on what others think about this particular advantage. Does controller need a bind for instant edit reset? Should scroll wheel exploits be banned?",FortniteCompetitive

Looking for a reliable partner for arena and World Cup. Unfortunately due to my work schedule I will not be able to compete in the World Cup until May and June. But I wanted to start practicing in Arena and getting some chemistry together so when it‚Äôs time to compete we are ready. Please don‚Äôt comment unless your 100% committed to playing in May and June. 

About me: I am 20 years old. my epic is Kakarotcx. Look up my stats if you choose. My stats are decent but not the best for the fact that I was a bot until like season 6 and I let my 10 yr old brother play on my account. I‚Äôve been playing competitively in fortnite since the day tournaments were available. I also have tournament and competitive experience in many shooter games.  I‚Äôve been playing since season 3 and have over 830 wins and have 310 points in arena. I played on Xbox until recently have made the switch to pc on controller. I communicate very well and play late games very well. I have won at least 3-4 matches in champions league solo. I am more then ready to compete on the biggest fortnite stage. I am on now if you want to go ahead and get some games going. I‚Äôm down to warmup in creative and then hop In Arena. 


Requirements: must be in champions league. Must be 16+. Must be NAE region. Must have prior competitive experience in fortnite.

x-post /r/FPSAimTrainer

This year I decided to really focus on my aim, and conveniently around that time Aimer7 released [his routine](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vaba3potfhf9jy1/KovaaK%20aim%20workout%20routines.pdf?dl=0) for aim improvement. He advertised it in [this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/afo8p7/aim_workout_routine_with_kovaaks_fps_aim_trainer/) to wide popularity, and I see it often recommended around here for those looking to improve their aim. 

It‚Äôs now been about two months since I started the routine and now feels like a good time to look back on how I‚Äôve spent my time, what I‚Äôve liked/disliked, and what feels like it‚Äôs worked so far. I‚Äôd also like to share my results as thoroughly as possible, and hopefully give some insight to the community on the merits of this routine.

**DISCLAIMER:** I am not a Fortnite performer at the top level. [Fortnitetracker profile here](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/high%CF%95). I am just an individual who enjoys competitive play and continued improvement, hopefully my journey can help those looking to improve at a variety of levels.

# Personal Thoughts on Progress

**Opening thoughts**: Overall, I‚Äôm happy that I‚Äôve progressed so far and I‚Äôve had fun doing it. I‚Äôm about to move to the ‚ÄúSub-Intermediate‚Äù Phase and I anticipate things will start getting a lot more difficult -- which is a good thing because I‚Äôm beginning to feel as though I‚Äôm stagnating in many routines.

**On progress:** In most areas I‚Äôve seen consistent progress, and yet in others I am lacking. You can see from the graphs that my performance in *Thin Aiming Long Invincible* has remained fairly static over time. Poor performance in this is what prompted me to order a new mousepad and even eventually lower my sensitivity to try to have more control over my smoothness. In the end, I think I just need to grind away at it more.

**On the importance of accuracy in click-timing scenarios:** For click-timing routines, I‚Äôve noticed an interesting (and at times concerning trend): my TTK -- which I believe is a good approximation for my overall performance -- is *heavily* impacted by accuracy. On days where I slow down and force myself to care less about speed, I almost always do much better. This has led to some weird results: My *1wall6targets small*, *1wall6targets TE*, and *1wall9000targets* PRs are all roughly the same. This definitely doesn‚Äôt seem right to me. In my case, I‚Äôm guessing bigger and more targets tend to tempt me into wanting to go faster and therefore missing more often. Keep in mind these differences aren‚Äôt extreme, my accuracy is nearly always above 90%.

**On playing to the scenario:** I‚Äôve definitely noticed that familiarity with the scenario and the bots behavior plays a big role in my performance. I was sad to discover recently that if I went back to scenarios I played months ago, even after two months of consistent grinding and progress, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to touch the numbers I put up back then. Mostly for this I blame the scenarios being more fresh for me upon revisiting them. Still someday I‚Äôd love the satisfaction of firmly blowing my former self out of the water. Regardless, this implies to me that aiming in the actual game is highly important. Being able to understand and predict movement makes a huge difference.

**On in-game improvement:** Have I actually improved in-game? I think yes, in many cases I‚Äôll notice especially my AR is really on some days. In Fortnite it is a little difficult to tell the effect of aim alone. Unlike almost any other shooter, Fortnite has a second primary mechanic -- building -- which has nothing to do with aim but is equally important. Regardless, I do believe I‚Äôve improved but unfortunately the level to which I have improved is harder to quantify.

# Questions &amp; Answers

**Grip?** I started with a palm grip but have slowly clawed up more and more as I feel it gives me more stability and control with my aim. To each their own.


**Sensitivity?** When I started the routine I went from a long-time sens of 13.5cm/rev to 22.5cm/rev. A couple weeks ago I lowered even further to 27cm/rev (800dpi 0.076 Fortnite slider). I have every intention to stick with this sensitivity for a very long time.

**Routine?** I essentially followed Aimer7‚Äôs tracking routine verbatim, starting from ‚ÄúComplete Beginner‚Äù. Only change I made was to slice off 5 minutes here or there from the longer scenarios to make the routine feel a little more manageable to fit in my schedule. I will *Free Play* each scenario for the full duration the routine designates. I rarely ever use challenge mode. I will be moving to the ‚ÄúComplete‚Äù variation upon reaching Sub-Intermediate level

**Gear?** [Nixeus Revel mouse](https://www.amazon.com/Nixeus-Revel-Gaming-Windows-Rubberized/dp/B075MSPG3P/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=nixeus%2Brevel&amp;qid=1555698014&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-3&amp;th=1), [Aukey XXL mousepad](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QM9KL5M/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) 

**Personal Background?** I‚Äôm 28 with a full-time job, so practically ancient in the gaming world.

**Gaming Background?** A long time casual console player, my first ever M&amp;KB shooter and first ever competitive shooter was Fortnite. I know it‚Äôs a hip game to hate on Reddit, but I truly think it‚Äôs an innovative game and it inspires me to want to improve.

# Closing Thoughts

I hope this can help people get an impression of what they may expect from Aimer7‚Äôs routine. For some maybe it can provide a baseline to compare against. If your results are worse than mine I wouldn‚Äôt fret, we all work at our own pace and start at our own baseline. If your results are better, congrats I‚Äôm sure you deserve it.

If anyone has any constructive feedback or questions for me based on my data or this writeup, I welcome them. A big thanks to Kovaak, Aimer7, and this community for the progress I‚Äôve made so far.",FortniteCompetitive

I just find it so ridiculously absurd that they intentionally ignore all the discussion around it. It‚Äôs obviously all around the sub reddit and obviously they browse it on a daily basis (and even sometimes post replies), so no one can say that they are unaware of the ‚Äúdemand.‚Äù Not only that, but they also quickly fixed a way that had been found to change it via game files. 

So we already know it‚Äôs available. Not only is it available in the Unreal Engine, but it was already a thing in-game as well (internally, via game files). 

So why? What‚Äôs the reason? Why not communicate? Why not say what‚Äôs next? Sure, we can speculate about how it will affect frames and thus they don‚Äôt want to make the situation any worse than it already is, but why not say something so we can have certainty? Why leave us hanging? Why not let us know if they are planning to make it available anytime soon or never plan to, but say something. Say something and don‚Äôt leave us hanging, so people can put it behind them already. Whether we‚Äôll be glad to know it‚Äôs around the corner, or know it is never going to be introduce. At which point you can either try to make peace with it or quit, but you‚Äôll put this behind you.

https://i.redd.it/a20vmbbzy9t21.png

&amp;#x200B;

For a school assignment, I have been analyzing employee feedback for multiple gaming developers/publishers. While I was reading employee reviews for Epic Games on [indeed.com](https://indeed.com), I came across this review (and similar ones). 

&amp;#x200B;

For those that do not know what a quality assurance tester does, read this general position job description:  [https://www.jobhero.com/qa-tester-job-description/](https://www.jobhero.com/qa-tester-job-description/) 

&amp;#x200B;

The particular line that intrigues me:

""The QA Lead on the Fortnite team, is brain-dead and doesn't have any clue what is going on in-game in the project...""

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, this is just one employee's opinion (although you can find a few similar reviews from quality assurance testers online). This could, however, be part of the reason Fortnite is so buggy, and why new patches bring in a slew of new bugs.

With the FOV trick that is now patched I played with 100 FOV and it was amazing. Finally it was like I was playing with stretched again. It also made the performance and the frames better. I thought increasing the FOV would make the fps worse but it didn‚Äôt. I also have an outdated pc build with bad specs yet still fortnite ran perfectly. Please Epic do not force us on 80 FOV it is terrible,FortniteCompetitive

So this is rough but should give us a decent idea of some of the names we shouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see competing for the top duo prize in NYC. 

So the way I figured it out was using the last four official duos tournaments; Gauntlet Duos Finals, Scallywag Cup Finals, Luxe Cup Finals and the latest event The World Cup Warm-Up Finals. 

Using the amount of duos that are eligible to qualify from each region I assigned points to each team for every cup, simply, those with the most points ranked higher than those with less points. So using 1-20th in EU with 20 points to first place 19 for second all the way down to 1 point for 20th place. In Oceania, only 3 can qualify for the region so I used the top 3 in every event with 3 points for 1st and 1 for 3rd. 

For example, Benjy and Savage won the last duos event giving them 20 points (20 teams qualify for WC Finals from EU - 5 sessions, 4 per session.) Using this same parameter I took the top 20 from each EU tournament, top 15 from NAE, top 5 from NAW and top 3 from OCE, ASIA and BRA, respectively. And combined all of the placements into an overall rank for the region. 

I did it this way to try and get a wider pool of players, however we know the WC doesn‚Äôt work like this and at any time a duo could come out of nowhere and nab a spot in their region despite performing poorly in previous weeks. 

NOTE: The previous tournaments not being region locked does cause some of the NA rankings to become odd - many ‚Äòqualified‚Äô on both regions. And naturally people testing out different partners can also become a difficulty. 

Hopefully that makes sense and this is somewhat useful, especially in the regions you may know less about - each region has its own tab so you can see where everyone placed in individual tournaments. 

If you have any questions please let me know and I‚Äôll do my best :)",FortniteCompetitive

Qualifiers are flawed but are solid enough that most of the best players will qualify and the number of underqualified people to get in will be few. 

&amp;#x200B;

Don't mistake this for fanboi nonsense. If you look at my post history there will be a lot of me talking about how Epic made the greatest shooter of all time essentially by accident, and that they have demonstrated either an active animosity towards competitive integrity or a frankly stupid misunderstanding of how competitive incentives work. Nonetheless, this game is still awesome. It's the most innovative shooter ever made. It's the most fun shooter ever made. And despite bugs or RNG or hamster balls spoiling some of the fun, there simply isn't a better game out there and WC is going to be awesome. Fortnite is the king, and there isn't' even a real challenger to the throne.

&amp;#x200B;

First week of qualifiers showed that even with all those problems the cream still rises to the top. There will be heartbreaks of people who don't qualify, and there will be dark horses who make it, but I think most people are going to look at the final list and be like ""yeah... that's a pretty damn good list of the best players in the world even if it ain't perfect.""

&amp;#x200B;

My hope is that you all continue to complain and whine and ask Epic to change the things that so very much need to be changed, but that you also take a step back to love and enjoy the good parts of the game for yourself. Don't let yourself get tilted into quitting, raging, or losing your sense of fun in the game. Push for changes, be passionate, express yourself. But don't lose your joy.

_____

Wall/roof replace battles are critical in fortnite. The person with the better ping should not have a large advantage in these situations. 

The premise I will work off here is that the replacer will always get the wall. 

First I‚Äôll describe the three changes needed to make this a reality; then I‚Äôll describe the benefits of changing the game. 
_____

1. A player can not replace their own structure for 0.2 seconds after it is broken.

2. Build delay from pickaxe or weapon will be the same as build delay from holding out a build, which will be changed to 0.05 seconds.

Changes 1-2 will allow the aggressor to easily retakes walls on the first try.

3. Builds will have a 0.3 second grace period where no bullets/entities can pass through them after they are broken. This is (will be) smaller than the duration of the breaking animation. 

Change 3 will prevent damaging a player holding a wall from a distance, by any means. It will also prevent players from pickaxing and simply walking/falling into the box of another player if the build is being held. Sadly change 3 will also prevent bopping players with the pump. 

4. Med kit timer brought down to 8 seconds. Max stack dropped to two med kits. Bandages timer brought down to 2, mini shield to 1.5, big shield to 3, chug jug to 10. 

Change four will make meds and shield easier to get off during fights. It would also buff bandages and med kits endgame. 
_____

How would the meta change? 

1. Would players no longer be able to box up and heal? This is the wrong question. Players already can‚Äôt box up and heal if they have to hold the wall. The right question is would players no longer be able to box up and wait for a third party/the storm to come save them from impending doom. The answer is no. 

The mechanics for healing during a fight will be exactly the same as they were, only being impacted (incentivized) by change 4. 

2. Would too much w keying occur? With the current point system, no, depending on your definition of too much. In a battle royale, if an aggressor gets another player low when there‚Äôs nobody around, there‚Äôs no reason not to try and follow up. 

This is where change 4 comes in again. The defending player will have the opportunity to heal up a bit, but they should not expect that‚Äîbased solely on their ping‚Äîthey can sit in their box invulnerable until they exhaust their mats. 

When the attacking player tries to retake a wall it will become the defending player‚Äôs responsibility to make a move. Edit before he takes the wall and bop them unexpectedly. Use those cool build fighting techniques we all know and love to get height! Go damage them. That‚Äôll probably cause them to back off. Otherwise use mobility to escape. Mobility shouldn‚Äôt always be able to be kept for endgame. It can be helpful here. 

3. Would a player be able to sit in a pyramid? Yeah. That‚Äôll prevent spraying from all angles. It already works if you have 0 ping. However, the player will have no visibility, and if someone walks up to them and takes the pyramid, well...

The spraying prevention in general would be a good thing. Sometimes the whole lobby chooses to spray someone‚Äôs 1x1. The player should be able to defend by wasting mats without taking damage from afar. 
_____

What do you think? Should low ping players be able to sit in a 1x1 when getting pushed? Or should they be forced to play the game, find an advantage, and overcome the evil w keyer?

Also do you think meds should be faster? I do. Especially that legendary one nobody ever uses.

&amp;nbsp;

as you can see these are spaced exactly 1 minute apart more or less, this was just an example from a quick playground test, there are many, many more stutters in the logs, but would obviously not fit in here, just wanted to point out the 1 minute regular ones, there are many more irregular ones too, as mentioned I have been sending these logs to epic in hopes of it getting resolved, I believe they are working hard to resolve them and find some kind of balance for all users/different cpus,

&amp;nbsp;

pre 8.30 this didn't occur but heavy scenes would drop my fps a bit, which was normal, at 8.30 release performance was great for me personally, higher fps than ever in heavy scenes like flying over / looking over tilted towers, 120 fps solid and no stutters at all not even the slightest, but then these recent mini updates and the 8.40 updates introduced heavy and frequent stuttering, while I have to admit my fps is still higher than pre 8.30 in terms of heavy scenes, the frequent, regular aswell as irregular stutters and microhitches has made me not play the game at all lately since its unenjoyable and I find myself focusing on stutters instead of the match itself, and then not play at all or play other games, this is coming from a s1 player who used to log unhealthy amount of hours per day in this game since I loved it so much, am still hopeful it will be better soon though,

&amp;nbsp;

have been saving money and planning for an upgrade to my whole system aswell but from what I can gather recently, even higher end hardware users are experiencing stutters and microhitches, perhaps to a lesser degree than my kind of hardware or similar/lower end hardware, I can't say but looking at the competitive subreddit there are recent threads with hundreds of upvotes complaining about stutters or performance in general, and many of the players in those posts have good/great hardware, which is a concern,


&amp;nbsp;

this subreddit compared to the competitive historically has been less vocal about performance issues and things like memes or funny clips get a lot more attention but it seems to get worse and worse and more obvious with performance problems now, maybe i'm wrong IDK,but i'll keep sending my logs to epic and be optimistic about the stutters being resolved for everyone in the near future!


&amp;nbsp;

if anyone wants to check their gamelogs from matches to find these ""loggarbage"" events and stutters, they can be found in ""C:\Users\Alex\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Logs"" on your hard drive, ""Alex"" is obviously my own username and you have something else there, also have to show hidden files in file explorer I believe in case you can't find them,

&amp;nbsp;

it can be a bit hard to find the most recent ones since the timestamping system on the logs seem a bit wonky aswell as my logs are 2 hours behind my real local time for example, but a good tip is to delete the logs between every test session in playground/real matches/game sessions so you only have 1 log file to focus on at the time and you know its the most recent one that way, thats how I did it anyway,

&amp;nbsp;

my specs: i5-3470 quadcore cpu, 2x4gb ddr3 ram, gtx 1060 6gb, win10 1809 version, 120 fps framecap 1920x1080 resolution all gfx settings lowest,

&amp;nbsp;

timeline of performance for me: 

&amp;nbsp;

pre 8.30 update: ""baseline performance"", what we had for the longest time I guess, solid performance overall, no stutters or hitches for me personally, heavy scenes like tilted/retail/pleasant would drop the fps down to 60-90 depending on whats going on, but it was stable and predictable behavior,

&amp;nbsp;

8.30 update release: best performance ever, in my case atleast, heavy scenes no longer dropped my fps from 120 but was rock solid pretty much even flying over / looking over tilted towers etc,

&amp;nbsp;

post 8.30 update and the small minipatches leading up to and including 8.40 update: still high average fps in heavy scenes like tilted towers etc, but a lot of regular framedrops from 120 down to ~50 fps, backed up by the 1 minute interval ""loggarbage"" events in the gamelogs with 40-60 ms of frametime spikes as seen above in my log examples, aswell as various stutters and framedrops in between, mostly when interacting with the server/world like shooting a gun/pickaxing/placing builds etc, all these actions will drop the fps for some reason, and then the 1 minute regular stutters never go away, even in the game menu there are stutters,


&amp;nbsp;

sorry for the long post , I encourage other users to check their logs for these loggarbage events and how many milliseconds of frametime spikes they have, I believe users on higher end hardware have less severe stutters and perhaps don't notice them at all or as well as lower/midrange users, maybe it depends on core count/thread count too, IDK..but by doing this and checking the logs maybe we can find out some common theme or what kind of cpus are worse affected than others, or something, IDK, i'm just someone who loves the game and is really concerned about the performance issues driving players away from the game, again i've played since season1 and logged an extreme amount of hours in the game, even pre 8.30 when my fps was bad in heavy scenes I played so much because of love for the game, and the fps drops were predictable and I knew if I was in a heavy scene I would have to work around it and be more careful with aim etc, but now its a constant issue, I find myself focusing on stutters more than the match, so I play other games or not at all instead, i'd much rather play the game and enjoy it, believe me.

&amp;nbsp;

for whatever its worth, happy easter anyway ! hopefully things will be better soon!",FortniteCompetitive

Because most people are only complaining about this now, we can assume that this was caused by the **v8.30** update. 

I am currently a C# programmer (as a hobby, and I use Unity Engine) that can write basic code and understands the fundamentals of game code and basic performance enhancements.. The reason that you lag when looking at buildings, the reason people seemingly come out of nowhere with no audio to be seen, is because of how Fortnite's **renderer** works. 

As this only started occuring in the recent v8.30 update, we can assume that any major changes to Fortnite's renderer were made then. In game engines (or at least, Unity), there is a technique known as **occlusion culling**, which disables the rendering of objects that cannot be seen by the player (this means they are either off-screen or behind other objects) in order to conserve CPU power. 

Disabling occlusion culling gives players a substantial FPS increase when idle, but when moving their camera in such a way that a mass collection of objects have to be processed and loaded, a substantial FPS decrease will occur. 

Now, there's a fair chance I could be wrong, but I believe that Epic Games has disabled occlusion culling in v8.30. It is the only logical reason that these FPS drops are occuring in these specific scenarios.

If an Epic Games developer sees this thread, *please* enable occlusion culling (if you have disabled it) before the World Cup. Your players in New York City will be playing on high-end PC's (I assume, due to your company's net worth being billions) and even Ninja's PC (probably one of the best around) has severe frame drops without occlusion culling in endgames.

I understand how disabling occlusion culling would increase FPS substantially for your casual community/pub players, where there are not as nearly as many buildings nor players endgame, but eventually one of your World Cup qualifiers is going to snap and quit the game right there, on the spot.

TL:DR I believe Epic changed their code in v8.30 and it's causing lots of frame drops. Good for casuals, bad for pros.

I'm sure your team has implemented this as the developers there seem fairly competent (albeit not very thorough), but if you haven't you should set up object pooling for structures. Frame drops don't just occur because of player-built structures, it's structures in general. Again, I can only write basic code, but I have enough understanding of the fundamentals to know what's going on and how your game can be optimized. Thank you for taking the time to read my post, and I hope that you take this post to heart, Epic Games. Sometimes we can get really pissed off at you guys but in reality we just don't want the game to die. We're here to help, don't just sit there and ignore us.",FortniteCompetitive

Dafran is and will forever be the most gifted mechanical player in Overwatch, and his personality is addicting which means people love him. He wasn‚Äôt happy with the state that the game he loved was in, so he boycotted them in a seriously toxic way: He encouraged everyone to ‚Äúthrow‚Äù every competitive match they played. This meant choosing the worst heroes, or the best (and not do anything with them) which had a really, REALLY negative impact for the Pro scene and the game in general.

Now, this movement didn‚Äôt really accomplish much because Overwatch wasn‚Äôt nowhere as much -shit- as Fortnite is right now. But the sentiment is what counts, he didn‚Äôt like the game so he did something about it. And that‚Äôs we all need to do, boycott epic.

I know that there is money on the line and believe me, **i want some of it too** but they will keep ruining the game more after each update because we allow them too and keep playing and buying ugly skins.

Stop buying skins, and next qualifier will be our last. Stop playing comp after this qualifier, and we need actually important people in the scene to support the movement. If we don‚Äôt play, epic won‚Äôt have a show to put up. But WE ALL NEED TO COMMIT.

And the shitty ass update didn't make our situation much better either, when people with beast computers are dying of lag, how bad is it for us. My last fucking win WAS IN DIVISION 5. It's just so hard to get a win once there's more than 10 people in a small zone on console. I'm looking at pc build right now. I recommend you do the same, because there's simply no chance you're gonna qualify if you're on console. Honestly before I started scrimming and before playing arena, I legit thought I had a chance, but now if I keep playing on console, at best I'm just going to earn a few hundred bucks, solely because we're just at a MASSIVE disadvantage.

All content updates were turned into patches and performance upgrades. I think Fortnite desperately need such Season.

There's a lot of things that need fixing, changing or even removing. Here are they:

* first build placing speed \[change it to the previous, faster, one\]
* excessive phasing through structures \[make it predictable or change it in a way so it doesn't interfere with gameplay\]
* hit registration issues (especially with shotguns) \[fix blank shots, ghost shots, shotgun not shooting, shooting when trying to edit\]
* editing clunkiness or not responding at all \[make editing smooth, remove random performance hits when editing in close proximity, make editing consistent\]
* broken turbobuild \[not being able to place any builds, excessive builds which placing is not intuitive\]
* performance issues \[random FPS drops, sudden ping increase, game freezing, lag spikes- being teleported from highground when close to the edge or unpredictable movements of your character, general optimization\]
* seperated items pool in Competitive gamemodes and Tournaments \[getting rid of ""fun"" and useless weapons and gadgets- bow, pistols, tactical shotgun, thermal AR, scoped AR, turret, hunting rifle, balloons\]
* loot availability and adjustments \[removing ammo from floor loot and restricting it to ammo boxes, removing gadgets from floor loot and restricting them to chests and vending machines, 100% floor loot and chest spawn, removing grey rarity of items, decreasing the maximum amount of carrying and dropping throwables- 2 per drop and 4 max carrying, decreasing the max amount of carrying Rift to Go'es to 1, increasing Launch Pad drop rate, removing RPG and Grenade launcher from vending machines, restricting Grenade launcher to supply drops only, reducing the max amount of carrying explosive ammo to 6- for RPG 1 ready to shoot and 5 extra; for Grenade launcher 3 ready to shoot and 3 extra, Heavy Sniper nerfed damage to 145- Epic variant and 147- Legendary variant\]
* Siphon adjustments \[20/20/20 mats from 50/50/50 goes straight into your inventory, 30/30/30 drops on the eliminated player\]
* vehicles availability and adjustments \[vaulting ballers, 100% quadcrasher and driftboard spawn, quadcrashers and drifboards available at current ballers spawns, after 3rd zone fully closes all vehicles are destroyed, fixing inconsistent damage taken while exiting vehicles\]
* stretched resolution \[adding an FOV slider\]
* communication between Epic and players \[explaining the choices and added features- why; what exactly; possible outcomes, constant dialogue regarding current state of the game and upcoming features, mentioning about any changes made to the map that may change the gameplay- unnamed locations, houses, chest spawns(!)\]
* future content and changes \[implementing a Test Server for the players, regular seeking for feedback\]
* sound \[improving the quality of sound in general, improving the directional audio, improving the audio for enemy players movements and actions, making the ambient noises and controlling player actions quieter compared to the enemy, decreasing volume of certain weapons and noises\]
* changes made to the playlists \[separating the Competitive and Casual playlists and balancing them differently\]

Of course, Fortnite is a different from any other game and some may argue that it would discourage people to play the game when there's no new content. However, there is a lot of things that can be done with the stuff that's ALREADY in the game or WAS in the game. I'm sure that casuals would be happy if Epic rebuilt some old locations and attached some lore to it. Let me know what you think about this.

Warning: V. Long post:

TL;DR: Epic should allow players to self-sort themselves in three categories: Bots, casuals and competitive players. The three permanent game modes should cater to each one respectively: Team Rumble, Pubs (reverted), Arena (fixed). New content should be implemented sectionally to reduce game-breaking metas, with the community consulted on each step in the process (i.e new content is first tested in Team Rumble, then refined and cautiously implemented in pubs and finally in Arena)

&amp;#x200B;

Post:

For some quick context, I am a very casual player that plays less than 2 hours a day and only have a few solo wins to my name, mostly in arena mode (contender league). That said I really enjoy the game, watching pros compete, and would like to see the competitive game grow just as much as the causal game.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem:

The biggest problem Epic is facing is trying to make the game accessible to new (and young) players. Obviously, there is a growing skill gap in the game, making public matches very frustrating for new players to play. Epic‚Äôs current solution is to try and bring everyone down to the bot level (ballers, removing siphon, taking away farming buffs requiring very passive gameplay for the first 10 minutes of the game), which doesn‚Äôt really help bots get better, and makes competitive and public play a nightmare. Aggressiveness isn‚Äôt the problem, it‚Äôs that new players aren‚Äôt equipped to deal with actual gameplay, making both bots and sweats want to leave the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Bot Solution:

Making Team rumble a permanent mode is the perfect solution. With no stakes and respawn, new players can grow much faster at basic gameplay mechanics without having to farm for 10 minutes and break their keyboard every time TTV\_GitGud bum rushes them. Also with the chaos of end-game team rumble, they will be able to experience some of the higher stress situations that they will be in during an actual match and grow their game-sense as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Casual Solution:

This would allow for pubs to be reverted. If team rumble catches most new players, then pubs can be fixed to allow for better players to enjoy the game. Pubs should be a challenge to win and players shouldn‚Äôt be punished for being good. Therefore, by creating sections (bot, casual, competitive -&gt; Team Rumble, Pubs, Arena), Epic can have a self-sorting ranked system. To increase the effectiveness of self-sorting, they could add incentives like Team Rumble specific challenges with rewards for no-skins.

&amp;#x200B;

Competitive Solution:

With bots and casuals in a better situation, Arena mode could be fixed. Right now (especially with ballers), a pretty low-level or (needlessly) aggressive player can make it pretty far in arena with no consequences because there is no de-ranking in place. This means that end-game champion league has less than 15 players in the moving circles, and there are still psychopaths that storm push and w-key without regard to personal risk, thereby griefing other people‚Äôs games. 

Most reputable Esport games have a ranked mode that have stakes like de-ranking and global (or at least regional) leaderboards. Tourney qualification eligibility shouldn‚Äôt just be ‚Äúchampions league‚Äù but should instead be a cutoff on the leaderboard (i.e top 10,000 players or something of the like). This creates incentives to play more intelligently as well as gives meaning to continue playing ranked. 

&amp;#x200B;

Content and Bugs Solution:

This brings me to the fix for the looming shadow that is Epic‚Äôs failure to maintain a balanced game, as well as their inability to fix game-breaking bugs (audio, 5 fps in end-game circles, turbo build not working, ping being the determining factor in defensive v aggressive gameplay etc). By implementing sectional game modes, Epic would have a built in pipeline to test new content. Instead of adding a gold infantry rifle to all modes at once, Epic could try new content in Team Rumble first (for about a week), iron out bugs and balance the addition, and then add it to pubs. If after 2-3 weeks of effective gameplay, Epic could poll the community and potentially add the new content to Arena mode (which should directly reflect tourneys). 

This four week content pipeline would also allow epic to shift focus to polishing the game. Instead of arbitrary updates every two weeks, it could instead spend that time and money on maintaining and improving actual gameplay. Moreover, with the pipeline and polls, Epic could demonstrate an active involvement in the community while producing a much more polished game. 

&amp;#x200B;

Conclusion:

Ultimately if Epic continues to treat the entire player base as the exact same, while catering only to a small portion of it, Fortnite will fail. Epic should actively separate it‚Äôs player base, and recognize that there are different classes within the game and should actively change the game to better suit each class.",FortniteCompetitive

Not to mention the shere toxicity shown due to their young age: bming, dming you racist, edgy bs in discord when you killed them in a snipes match etc.  

Its sad because even with most moving to PC, there's still a lot of talented console players who may never get fair recognition because the community members and these shitty clans have turned the community into a meme. It's especially sad in contrast to what the PC community was like: a lot of more welcoming, more mature (despite similar age ranges) and definitely not as toxic. I can't speak on scrims/snipes now because It's been a while since I've played console but I'm doubtful there's been a significant change. Am I wrong?

The top picture is 1920x480 stretched back to normal proportions. (In-game everything looks squished together)  On the bottom is the same setup on 1920x1080. Obviously this kind of stretched gives you more horizontal FOV instead of more vertical FOV. 480 is a bit extreme to look at and play with but higher resolutions work too of course (the lower= the more stretched).

Cannons and Ballers are really clunky at times, I can never tell when i'm gonna take damage on a vehicle, Pumps give me hitmarkers when I actually hit a freshly built wall, Just yesterday my fps range went all the way to 2 to 74 in a 1v1v1, so now I don't even know if I can play creative anymore, Large Endgames are a mess and aren't worth trying to sweat in unless you're on PC and have a decent CPU to render all of the carnage, Phasing has gotten so bad that epic made it a game mechanic. people avidly get stuck in between builds, traps are still gay because they can still be placed in the middle of a box, and on top of that, the audio of the game was made terrible for no reason but to have a large content update for v8.00

These are all of the issues that i've seen, I don't even play for more than 2 hrs a day on average and I stopped playing more than once this season


Why? why is it okay to just deal with these bugs? everytime i get a camera glitch when i enter the baller, i just keeping going in and out of the baller until it works again, this isn't supposed to be something that players get used to in your game, you shouldn't feel satisfied with yourself as a top figure in the Epic Games Studio when your game, the Biggest game in the World, is a buggy mess that no one wants to play

I see people getting mad at complainers all the time for not cutting epic slack on their decision-making, but as the IP of the Biggest Game in the World, how can you choose to rush out content every week/2 weeks? It's great for the fans so that things are fresh, but why not just polish what you already have?

There are 14 Vaulted Weapons in fortnite (different types not including rarity), so all fortnite needs to do for content updates, are add in ltms and events, along with changing their Weapon/Consumable Pool every Biweekly, stop sticking to your bs storyline, and add different pools of movement (e.g Ballers and Hop Rocks in one Biweekly, Rifts and Driftboards in another Biweekly) that way you can keep your game fresh, while not having to run yourself out of ideas, and once you've been able to actually think clearly now that you're not busting ass to find new content to add like a starving LispyJimmy, then you can prioritize Balancing and Bug Fixes like any Normal Game would do, and if you were to focus on balancing your game every update, then you could make polls asking the competitive and casual community SEPERATELY, what they feel needs to be added or changed in their game mode, so that you don't have pc players going into septic shock because Native Rez causes extreme Constipation, and you don't have Faze_TimmYNinja getting cucked by a TTV Sweat that's a year older than him in fucking Deep Fried: Food Fight.

There's a lot more problems with Fortnite and it's Management Team, but let me summarize it all with this:

Epic, all of us who are still in the community REALLY love your fucking game, Casuals, Sweats, Content Creators and Pro Players, but you're really killing this game by trying to stick to your magic formula you've held up to this point, your stupid 2 week content update bs, has been the cause of Quad Launchers, Boom Boxes, Bottle Rockets, Balloons, and a Variance of Bugs

STOP TRYING TO FUNNEL NEW CONTENT INTO THIS GAME SO OFTEN, AND INSTEAD REUSE THE GOOD CONTENT YOU HAVE, ALONG WITH COMING UP WITH BUG FIXES AND BALANCES INSTEAD OF CONTENT IDEAS!

that's all I had to say, Discuss in the Comments, and let me know if there's something i did wrong or something you disagree with.

I would say my aim is above average, if I win it‚Äôs 90% because I‚Äôm aiming better than my enemy.

How can I be highest division, able to join WC qualifiers, I don‚Äôt get it. And no I‚Äôm not grinding 5 hours a day, i guess I‚Äôd average 1-2 hours, still quite a bit but no grind imo. 

Now I‚Äôd say reaching champ division doesn‚Äôt mean anything, but my Duo believes we‚Äôre suddenly the greater fortnite players alive and will easily qualify for wc (I wasn‚Äôt gonna bother to play, I know we‚Äôll just get shit on).

I know the rx580 is supposed to be slightly superior overall, however I've heard that Fortnite heavily favors nvidia GPUs. From looking at benchmark videos on youtube, that seems to be true. Since I mainly play fortnite, that could be a sufficient reason to go with a 1060. 

But I'll also be getting an AOC freesync (and not g-sync) monitor [https://www.amazon.fr/AOC-Gaming-G2590PX-√©cran-Rouge/dp/B078S36M7Y](https://www.amazon.fr/AOC-Gaming-G2590PX-%C3%A9cran-Rouge/dp/B078S36M7Y), so would having that technology justify going with the rx580 despite lower FPS?

**PLEASE UPVOTE FOR EPIC'S ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE, THANK YOU**

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, so just before patch 8.30 was released, my game was running fine at 60+ FPS with little dips into the 50's when there are moments of heavy scenes. But after patch 8.30, I was getting 20 frames, sometimes even 10 frames even when I'm not even fighting. Patch 8.40 states that it has fixed this issue and if it hasn't, input ""-NoRHIThread"" into command line argument from the Epic Games Launcher. I tried that to no avail. I have removed it and put the command in over 5 times and it still isn't working. I also made sure the little dash in front of the N is in place as well. I believe that this only fixed users with decreased performance that have 2 CORE CPUs. I myself have a 4 core (Quad-Core) CPU. Many others users have also expressed their frustration about the FPS issues still not being fixed after the 8.40 patch. So I know for a fact that its not an issue with my PC. Those users that I have seen have 6 or 8 core CPU's. This proves my point about myself believing that this issue is only for users with more cores than 2. I hope Epic picks up on this and fixes it quickly, Others and myself really want to get back to playing the game and competing in the World Cup but the game is literally impossible to play with 20 frames, I can't even imagine endgame with those frames, it'll probably be 2 or 3 frames. I will list my PC Specs and my In-Game settings below.

If epic was somehow able to match you against people with the exact same skill then I would understand the issue. However now you are matched against players with similar performence in game. This means you are able to play as good as the people in your lobby because you made it there through console. If you played on pc instead maybe you could get higher because it is raising your performence in game.

The only reason why I am hating on console players whining is because it is hurting the entire competitive community. Because of the console players whining they removed for example stretched.

If they were to seperate the arena lobbies into one for consoles and one for pc the que times in champion division would get even longer and people are already complaining about the current que time.

Im Electriko, a spanish professional Fortnite Coach.

Many times people ask me for good routes. Many of you like safe routes and routes with ballers. So I made this infographics where you can see the spawn rates for ballers. This way, you can calculate or decide if your main baller spot is enough worth it for solo and/or for duo. I think we didn't learn yet the importance of maths and statistics in Competitive Fortnite ! I am working on more info like this one, if you like I will post again !

Say me if you have any questions or I can help you guys !

PD: You can follow me in Twitter (@R\_Electriko) if you want more info like that. If I see many of english speakers I will start to tweet in (bad) english too. Thank you for the support !

I am in Division 5 (about to be in Division 6).

My only problem is getting the jump from average to good.

What can I do to improve? I can decently build and fight but sometimes I still do mistakes.

I don't know if those custom courses really help me because it doesn't feel like it.

Also what are tricks in building I should be able to pull of (like 90s)?

Although it does sound like a bug and that you are actually still in champions if you drop, I think you should drop and receive the -2 bus fare. IMO this will reduce the amount of W-keyers in champion division who don‚Äôt care how many points they lose because they can‚Äôt get demoted.

I‚Äôve noticed lately that champions league solo lobbies have not been good practice at all for the World Cup. 15 person moving zone do not translate well to the 30-40 person moving zones in the qualifiers.

At first i thought it was just that i needed like 2 hours of warming up to actually start playing well but I eventually realised that it was just because of my cold hands.

###Shop theory: 

Archetype is the only datamined skin found so far that's unreleased. It's an entire set with skin, backbling, pickaxe, and glider, which would be huge for an entire twitch prime set.

###Twitch Theory

It's pretty past due for twitch prime set 3. The 3 skins already for Fortnite were based on Grey/Green camouflage. Twitch has shown they're ready to do bigger prime sets. Since PUBG got 2 entire skin sets for their last prime set.

Only time will tell, we'll find out in 2 hours. I've been waiting a while for Archetype, it just looks super good.",FortNiteBR

- overall have to generally play at a slower pace due to the limitations of a controller

This is LITERALLY the MOST common topic I have seen on Reddit as of late.. and I'm on mobile so I can't imagine how many posts I can't see , but I do know that there are literally 5 Xbox posts for every normal post that I CAN see.

If it's been burnt into my brain this hard, you know dam well EPIC knows about it as well.

I'm sure something is being worked on.

And to be honest..... WHEN it DOES get fixed, all you Xbox players better be DAM APPRECIATIVE of what EPIC has done for you... Because let's be honest, Microsoft isn't gonna do SHIT to fix the problem. Epic will have to update their client side to work around whatever problems Microsoft is having with the game. 

It's very obvious that it's a problem on Microsoft's side because no other platform is having issues to this degree....

building was more rewarding and also took more skill (no good turbo) and with that had a bigger skill gap. double pump was the most fun strategy to use. ever. it wasnt even op, it was just fun. (also double pump takes skill, you were just too bad and always died to it so you made up an excuse. or you legimately didnt like it. probably the first one tho)

splodes werent broken. (not just the launchers but grenades in general)

it was fun trying to 1v10. now its just suicide.

overall this game got so much worse since mid season 4.

sure fortnite is still tons of fun. but I feel like epic could have done so much better if they wouldnt have tried to go so hard after casuals and just kept the main game how it always was while only adding new stuff for the most part.

like tons people predicted when the double pump first got a delay, epic is going for casual players. and this just overall made the game worse (competetively for the most part, but you dont even need to play tryhard to think that it was more skill based than it is now and that you liked it more because of that)

News flash: people wear it because it looks cool

When season 5 started, everyone couldn’t wait to unlock the maxed out Drift because of how cool of a skin you get that’s relatively easy to unlock. So of course you’re going to see it everywhere in every game you play, because everyone likes it.

Heck, tons of people have created fan art of the Drift and they get plenty upvotes for it, but then as soon as people start using it in game, all of a sudden we hate it?

The same thing happened last season with Carbide and Omega. 

If Epic made skins simply for “status”, they wouldn’t try as hard as they do to come out with awesome skins for us to show off in game.

You may not be a casual gamer like me, but just because you’re competitive doesn’t mean you have to shit on my skin that I like to use for cosmetic purposes.

If you're not familiar with Paragon, it was Epic Game's incredibly fun and unique MOBA that I devoted hours of my time into before it was shut down. I loved that game. I ended with nearly 300 hours of playtime in just 2 years. The game ended up being cancelled because of the low player base. However, I along with many other people believe that the low player base was due to changes Epic kept making that no one asked for.

The game was constantly simplified with every update in hopes to create a more casual and accessible game for the masses. Their goal became not to create a fun and unique game, but to create a game that everybody can play and that everyone has an equal chance of winning.  This, in turn, consistently lowered the skill-gap, lowering the amount of competition in the game thus leading to a less fun experience overall.

I have been playing Fortnite since season 2 and absolutely love this game as well. I love competitive games and I love being better than other people at competitive games. What makes Fortnite so competitive is building. Build battles are incredibly intense and unique and there is no other experience like it in gaming. So I ask, why is the most unique part of the game being nerfed so heavily?

The only conclusion I can draw is that they want to create a more casual and accessible game. THIS IS WHAT KILLED PARAGON. A great game should be unique. It should difficult to master and learn skills. And you should be rewarded for learning these kills. You should be rewarded for practicing, playing more, and being better. I'm getting seriously concerned of the direction Fortnite is heading.  

So I ask, please undo the nerfs to building. Please change this spray and pray meta. Make the game more competitive again. I know your player base is dropping a little bit but your real fanbase and the people who really love the game will stick around and we will be the ones to make this game last. Keep the competition. Casual's should get stomped in the real game modes and that is why there is less competitive LTMs. Please change the direction this game is heading. Thanks.",FortNiteBR

The devs used to be so active with trying to make a better game for its community. Today it seems like they are focusing on bringing in new players and making it seem easier for them by lowering the skill-gap which will give them more money.

I just played a game where I had 10 kills when there were 22 left (solo) and I died while pushing a bot which was spraying me with his AR and drum gun and then out of nowhere getting pinched from the back. Tried building like a maniac, but It did not do anything. While I was feeling like I'd beat my 15 kill solo game record easily (maybe first ever 20 bomb), and feeling like nobody could stop me, I then get mowed down by two bots within seconds. Usually I'd be able to counter that with building and using a bouncing pad/jump pad to get away, but this time every wall and floor instantly got destroyed.

I feel like such a child with this title, but it's the truth. I thought Epic was finally the devs I always wanted, keeping focus on what the community wanted, focusing on more experienced players too while also not forgetting about new players. But it turns out that is not what I thought it was. 

History seems to repeat itself. Hopefully they get a change of attitude and do not choose to go down the route that The Division and H1Z1 took by taking away the core fundamentals that make the game what it is, just because it was not the way they wanted the game to be played, but I doubt they will change anytime soon.",FortNiteBR

Now personally, before Fortnite the games I played were a few years old and typically ran with good, or at least stable framerate. But unfortunately new games don't do so hot and a new gaming PC is just not a feesable option at the moment. Now the guys at EPIC did a fantastic job optimizing the game for iOS and are working with Tencent to accomplish the same for Android. NOW HERE IS MY PROPOSAL; what if Epic worked to come out with a new graphics mode, or modes for that matter, so that more players would be able to play the game at 60 fps with full resolution. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT MORE SETTINGS FOR GRAPHICS QUALITY, IM TALKING ABOUT A NEW SET OF GRAPHICS THAT PLAYERS CAN CHOOSE THAT ARE WORK WELL WITH LOWER END COMPUTERS, kind of like the iOS version of the game. Now I know this is no easy process and Epic would have to invest resources to optimize and rework the game to accomplish this feat. But they have proven that they can make this happen, and honestly, there are older fps games that look great in my eyes that run well on my PC, I'm sure everyone will be plenty happy playing with altered graphics if it means stable framerate and having decent resolution. Not to mention what this would mean to competitors who have low to mid end gaming PCs who would like the highest framerate possible for competitive gameplay. I think this would expand the game's playerbase and even make people who already play on mobile more invested with the option to play on your average computer. Epic, at the end of the day, people are perfectly happy playing a game that looks decent, without having near leading edge graphics, if it means the game will run well on their system.

When fighting someone in solo, rocket launchers are a huge advantage, and I hate this. In late game, it is near impossible to win a fight against someone using double or even TRIPLE rocket launchers, especially if you don't have one. Double shotguns are a breeze to fight against compared to this, yet Epic Games hasn't paid any attention to this issue at all.

One thing I love about Fortnite is that the loot doesn't make a huge difference in most fights. A legendary assault rifle is an upgrade and nice to have, but it isn't OP in comparison to a common or uncommon, and you can still win fights and even games without it. But with Rocket launchers, you can go through 10 games without finding one despite it being the deciding factor of most games.

Epic, if you don't want to nerf Rocket Launchers, at least remove the ability to use 3 or more at once. Blocking one rocket with a building is manageable, but keeping 3 at bay is near impossible (for me at least).

I believe this largely has to do with 50vs50. A large percentage of players that are less skilled immediately go to that game mode, because they can’t win solos/duos/squads. This has increased the skill gap in the other game modes. Especially solos. While it is fun to sometimes face only good opponents, it gets too tiresome to constantly face someone that can build a house in 3 seconds. This is a BR game, the lobby’s should be filled with all different kind of skill levels. I love build fights and that is why I love fortnite, but constantly fighting opponents with no rest in between good players and bad, every single game, does get annoying. Keep in mind, I’m not suggesting to remove 50vs50 because I can’t win, my win % and kd have been practically the same for the past few seasons. I just feel like it makes the game less enjoyable. 

TLDR: 50vs50 keep all the less skilled players out (mainly solos) over time, it gets tiring to only face good players. ",FortNiteBR

/:Double shotgun meta:/

You can skip this part.

EPIC GAMES KEEP MAKING MISTAKES

In season 4 before double shotgun nerfs newbies couldn't even stand a second against pro players.People started making  posts on reddit how unbalanced this meta was so epic games nerfed double shotguns, but that wasn't enough so they kept nerfing double shotguns. At the end of season 4 Double shotgun meta was in pretty good place,newbies could atleast stand a chance against pros,but people still complained about season 4 meta. So Epic Games saw great opportunity to remove Double Shotguns in Season 5. Double shotgun meta was replaced by spray and pray meta,but this solucion was even worse than a problem. 

So Epic Games keep making bad metas but why?

Its because Epic Games tries to please everybody from newbies to pros and that makes a problem.(Newbies cant stand a chance agaisnt pro players so Epic games nerfs mats and removes double pump,adds 50 megazine guns to the game),that makes games for newbies winnable but for pros not fun because newbies can just spam pro players and win.

So how would ranking system fix the game?

Newbies would encounter (LESS) or (NONE) average players.That would make game more fun for them because they wouldn't get demolished by good player and would have more chances to win also they could improve freely.But for average and good players games would be more difficult to win because they would compete with players same level as them that would make win feel more rewarding but also let you to improve quicker.

So epic games finally could balance meta correctly and make this game more fun.They could buff mats and add double pump back again people wouldn't as mad as before.

Ranking system = more competitive players and more toxicity?

Yes this game could be more toxic then right now but it wouldn't be as toxic as League of Legends and overwatch because you wouldn't be playing with bad teammates and fortnite  doesn't  have game chat so you couldn't flame players ingame.

So how would ranking system work?

That's the hardest part even I don't really know how this would work.The ranking system can't be like overwatch-league of legends because in their game there is about 5-10 players ingame but in fornite there is 100.But here is my suggestion.

I think there should be 3 ladders

Low Elo-Medium Elo-High Elo.

In Low Elo there would be 95% newbies 4%average players and 1% good players.

In Medium Elo there would be 5% newbies 90% average players and 5% good players

In High Elo there would be 3% newbies 40 % average players and 57% good players

Also people wouldn't make as much smurfs because people would grind on their main accounts because they will want to get rewards of every season :)

At 30% critical strike chance you're sure to have 30 or more attacks critical strike per 100 attacks. If you didn't critical strike for a long time your next attacks will have a higher chance.


Just replace *critical* with *bullet* and make it work both ways (I assume in LoL it already does even though it's not mentioned here) and there we have it.

This was done most likely for the competitive scene, this was confirmed by some pro players such as Parallax and Cloakzy when they asked the Devs.

So discussion time, how would you stop the turtling and building META without the spam meta and explosives becoming so strong?

While the shotgun META was amazing for Solos and normal ques it promoted building fights, Today AVG player base is much better than it was seasons ago and with the playground available, building fights would happen literally every time you encountered a player if past shotgun meta were to return today, excessive building would be a bigger problem than it was back then. The shotgun meta also had no real counter to turtling, camping especially on the PRO scene was at an all-time high with no counter to it. 

I have seen some popular suggestions such as:

* Capping material to 500, while increasing harvesting and/or give extra material when eliminating a player.

* Removing turbo building

* Limiting the number of structures placed on the same space/Unit, this would nerf turtling but also would nerf boxing yourself. (This would only work with SMG structure damage nerf)

So should Epic give up on trying to nerf turtling and building fights with the spam or explosives and simply work out their point format for the competitive scene? Or should they create another work around it?",FortNiteBR

Is there anything we can do to fix this? He has spent money on the game and all his skins and stats are on his account, it doesn't seem right for him to have to play on a different account to play with his brothers.

Tl;Dr my little brother can't play with us on pc because he has a child account. Is there anything we can do about this?",FortNiteBR

As you can tell from the title I play Fortnite on a mobile device, I also finished #1 Overall for Mobile and #21 on EU for every platform!

I was curious as to whether or not like in the past the #1 from each platform would be invited to summer skirmish, I know I'd get destroyed by the PC competition but I'd just love to see how far I could push myself or if I could even beat one pro PC player in a build off/gun fight. 

Anyway if there is any news for mobile players being invited to any event I'd love to know about it.

If you guys have any questions on how I play etc feel free to ask.

So I figured I would make this (On mobile btw sorry). I will constantly change it with ideas from the comments, so get writing! This is what we have so far:

**New Guns**
---------
**Rifles**
------
**Heavy AR**
Like the Thermal Scoped Ar but without the scope.

**Silenced AR**
Silenced like the pistol, and less damage but makes up for it because it is very quiet and you dont get an indicator when hit where the shot was from.

**Shotguns**
--------
**Automatic Shotgun**
An automatic shotgun that fires fast but does less damage.

**SMGs**
--------
**Scoped SMG**
A small scope like the lens sight in COD WW2, but less damage.

**Snipers**
--------
**Thermal Sniper**
A sniper with the thermal scope

**Heavy Sniper**
A piercing sniper that can break through player built walls. Does 90 Damage, Can go through 4 wood walls with -20 damage per wall, can go through 3 stone walls with -30 damage per wall and can go through 2 metal walls with -40 damage per wall, does not break the walls but does the respective damage to the wall.

**Zapotron**
A laser sniper like the Vacuum Tube Sniper in STW, needs a warmup time to shoot like the minigun, and during this time a visible laser points to where you are aiming, takes 3 seconds to charge then shoots for up to 5 seconds, shooting lightning that does 50 damage per second but not to walls. No scope and takes 3 seconds to reload.

**Pistols**
--------
**Firespitter**
 A pistol type gun that shoots mini grenades that do 30 damage in a very small radius, and explode on contact with enemies, otherwise explode 3 seconds after touching a surface, have an animation like the firework launcher's 'nades, uses shotgun ammo.

**Explosives**
--------
**XBow**
Explosive Crossbow in game files

**Frag Grenades**
Like normal grenades except do 70 damage plus 5 chunks of grenade go flying randomly, if hit does 45 damage body shot and 90 damage headshot.

**Pyro Grenades**
Explodes for no damage but give all surfaces in a 1.33 tile range the fire effect which if touching does 10 dmg per second, and then gives fire effect to player which does 1 dmg per second for 20 seconds. The main fire effect to surfaces lasts 30 seconds on wood or things that give wood, 20 seconds for stone structures and things and 10 seconds for metal as well as destroying wood structures when done.

**NEW: Backpacks**
They have their own slot and do different things, you can only hold one. There is:

**Jetpack**
Already ingame

**Storm Tracker**
Shows next circle

**Backpack**
Gives an extra slot for weapons or meds

**Shield Booster**
Gives +30 shield capacity

**Health Booster**
Gives +20 health capacity

**Tool Belt**
Gives +50% mats gained and +500 mats capacity

--------
**Healables**
--------
**Blue Syrup**
Like slurp for shield, gives 75.

**Green Syrup**
Like slurp for health, gives 60

--------
**Traps**
--------
You can only hold 5 traps, and there are so many to choose from! These are the new ones, of course there are still the old ones.

**Gas Trap**
Only goes on ceilings, when triggered drops a stink bomb.

**Disco Ball**
Only goes on ceilings, when triggered apply boogie bomb effect.

**Griller**
Only goes on floors, when triggered drops a pyro grenade.

**Mine**
Only goes on natural ground, when triggered detonates like a frag grenade.

**Fountain**
Campfire for shield.

**Teleporter**
Get 2 at a time and can only hold two. Can both be placed on floors only and can teleport players between them, max 15 tiles.

**Wall Darts**
The same as a spike trap but only on walls and shoots darts up to 2 tiles , can detect players up to two tiles away.

**Wall Enhancers**
Doubles wall health and immune to Heavy Snipers. Bullets do -50% damage as well can place anywhere player made.

**That's it so far!**
Put your ideas in the comment about anything at all you want to add to it or change, including grammar or splelling mistakes ;) ,additional info, new POI, guns to vault. Anything! If it gets 40 upvotes then I will add it, updating daily!

Performance issues and bugs will not be addressed. That being said, here is an ideal update based on the Numerous posts in reddit as well as Streamers suggestions.

***SHOTGUNS***

 **Pump shotgun**

   - Base damage increased from 80-85 (green-blue rarities) to 86-91

   - Headshot Multiplier changed from 2 to 2.35

   - Damage fall off slightly increased


*Pump shotgun headshots at PB range should be able to 1 shot anybody. The Max headshot damage for the green pump with this formula equals 202.1. This rewards skilled players who are able to close the distance between opponents and be able to land every pellet on the opponents head. With spread being the way it is, it is impossible to land a 200+ hit from any farther than point blank.*


 **Heavy Shotgun**

   - Base damage increased from 74-77 (epic-legendary rarities) to 77-81)


*Overall, the Heavy shotgun sits in a pretty nice place, but with a change to the pump in discussion, many people worry about the pump over taking the Heavy. This helps mitigate that effect. The epic Heavy can not 1 tap, but the Legendary can. The heavy has a faster fire rate, accuracy, magazine capacity, and slightly less fall off damage than the pump, making it, in general, more viable than a pump.*

 **Tactical Shotgun**

   - Base damage increased from 67-70-74 (common-uncommon-rare rarities) to 71-75-80

*The Tac shotguns also sits in a pretty nice spot, but dealing so little damage can be horribly detrimental to it's viability, especially in this ideal update where shotguns get buffed.


   - Double pump remains disabled

   - Pull out delay disabled for all shotguns when editing


***Pistols***

   - Accuracy increased by 15% (universal)

   - Spread reduced from .25 to .2 (universal)

-

 **Suppressed Pistol**

   - Damage increased from 26-28 (epic-legendary) to 28-30

-

 **Pistol**

   - Headshot multiplier increased from 2 to 2.5

-

 **Hand Cannon**

   - Fall off damage heavily decreased

-

 **Revolver**

   - Fall off damage heavily decreased


***Building***

 **Wood**

   - wall starting health increased from 80 to 90

   - ramp/ roof/ floor starting health increased from 75 to 80


**Brick**

   - wall starting health increased from 80 to 85

   - ramp/ roof/ floor starting health increased from 75 to 80

 
**Structures**
 
   - A new structure of the same type cannot be placed in the same spot for 0.3 seconds. (Example because i have no idea how to make this not sound misleading: You are fighting a player. He builds a 1x1 to heal/ reload weapons, aka 'turtling'. You shoot the wall, he places another. you shoot that wall down immediately. your enemy can no longer turbo build for safety for 0.3 seconds due to this cooldown. **Please note that this is my own personal take on how to get rid of turtling, and no outside opinions have been shared over this.**



***Assault Rifles***


 **AR's**

   - Automatic Assault Rifles (M4 and Scar) Accuracy increased 10%

-

  **Burst AR's**

   - Burst Assault Rifles (Burst and Famas) Accuracy increased 20%


*Burst Assault Rifles have always found their niche in other games as not being able to deal as much damage as a regular assault rifle, but have comparatively higher accuracy. An accuracy buff would be not only practical, but natural.*


 **LMG**

   - Can be mounted on the ground/ ledge/ window for improved accuracy


***SMG's***

   - All SMG's damage to structures decreased by 10%



As mentioned in the title, this is a collective list of changes based on the generous commenters of Reddit and Twitch streamers summed into a single ideal update. I personally think that, should this update be made reality, that the game would be far more balanced, incentivizing more aggressive and fun play. Let me know what you guys think, as I'd genuinely like to see open discussion on this, preferably civil.

TL;DR: Shotguns get damage buff, AR's get accuracy buff, SMG's get nerfed almost all around except for damage, 'Turtle' building nerf, and newly built structures buff.

Now, as the rocket was about to hit tilted, the rifts appeared and the rocket started flying around controlled by a blue energy which are hop rocks. My theory is that Omega gave the hop rocks to the Visitor to power the rocket, and thats why we see the rocket fly down in the blue energy.

When the rocket reached full height, the visitor activated the hop rocks to have enough speed to destroy tilted; but the hop rocks malfunctioned and created a rift. The more rifts the rocket travels into, the more the energy became unstable, and the final rift becames stable and teleported him into the sky and created a permanent snap in the sky.

This, in my opinion, is the best way to explain the existence of rifts. Criticism appreciated  ",FortNiteBR

Example: Wood - Oak (Standard), Birch (Uncommon), Dark Oak (Rare), Stone - Brick (Standard), Concrete (Uncommon), Cobblestone  (Rare), Metal - Steel (Standard), Bronze (Uncommon), Silver (Rare). (Note: the different textures WOULDNT grant extra health to the structures.) Maybe for wins every season you could unlock special textures in all 3 materials for the current season u got a win in, Wood (Season \_\_ win) - Zebrawood, Stone - Yellow Brick, Metal - Gold. Maybe later on different materials take place of the previous materials but same health as previous materials. (you would still be able to use the standard wood, stone, or metal or any previously unlocked materials. Sorry for the long paragraph. I think its a great idea. ",FortNiteBR

Low DMG compared to fire rate.
Lowered headshot multiplier.
Long pullout delay.
Which means an SMG can melt you before you even have a chance of shooting back.

Tac shotty is still good, but an SMG is still better.

Building is getting nerfed more and more.

Epic are trying to make the game as casual as possible.

”Just get good” 
I´m not saying i´m a good player.
That pump shotgun takes the same time to pull out even if you are the best player in the world.

”Stop bitching about the meta” 
If you are enjoying this meta, more power to you.
But i personally don´t, since SMGs require way less skill than shotties.
SMGs should be good, but not better than shotguns.
Both guns should be equal in having their own pros/cons.

1. Hundreds of thousands of people play this game. Epic games cannot just appeal to every player in the fanbase. So don't expect to get everything YOU want.

2. Remember when people said shotguns were too good, Nerf them? Epic did that by removing double pump. Then people started complaining about there NOT being double pump, so they brought it back. And still, even after this, people started complaining that shotguns are too good, Nerf them. Epic did, and now you're mad. Same with everything else. If epic nerfs something, you complain. If they buff something, you complain. Epic tries their best to appeal to what the players want.

3. There is a way to counter the meta. Instead of rushing at every player you see, dying, complaining, repeat, just stay back, hit some shots with an AR, pistol, sniper, get them to low health, then go towards him and he's at low health and you can get the kill. Smg's are close range. 30-40 meters away, nothing happens. IT HAS COUNTERS, USE THEM.

4.Every online game has metas. There was the Shotgun/building meta, and epic wanted to change it up. They changed the meta, so people wouldn't get bored.

5. The last thing you can do. If you don't like where the game is right now, play something else. Go outside for once. Find some new games to play. Other things exist than Fortnite.

Minigun should have an overheat system in place after about 100-200 bullets.This would still make it viable but not ridiculous.

Drum gun
Reduce the drum guns magazine to 35-40 bullets so less spam can be done. 50 is just too much in my opinion. Potentially reduce it's structure damage slightly.

Material health
Put starting material health back to what it was originally so guns don't melt through wallsas fast.

Shotguns
Buff shotguns so they're actually consistent and  maybe so the pump can one tap on the 'perfect headshot' (debateable)

Splodes 
Add a radius for splodes so 100% damage isn't taken if the explosion is far away from you.

P90
Give the p90 a close range structure damage nerf but not too significant that it's still viable.

3.	 team place 6

Now I abandon let's say team place 12 challenge.

The next day I abandon the next team challenge. Let's say team place 6. What do I get? Yes, team place 12.

1.	Live longer than enemies in team mode
2.	team place 12
3.	 some other random challenge

And the same now repeats over and over again! It doesn't matter which of these 2 team challenges I dismiss. I will always get the third team challenge which is team place 6.

Please call me whenever you fix this state your game is in. I have loved Fortnite since late season 2 and have been playing daily since early season 3. However, with the new state your game is in, I have no desire to play. SMGs are made way to OP at the same time you nerf wood, and shotguns are pathetically bad. I admired when you took out the one pump, but double pump is something that required plenty of skill and you removed it. The P90 should not be nerfed, it should be removed. The meta now is one person with a mini gun and another with a P90 or another SMG (and don’t even get me started on squads). How is it supposed to be an enjoyable experience when you physically just have to build until you die because there is no way to combat to spam shooters. The only way I can still enjoy this game is if I land tilted and try to just eliminate people until the same thing happens again, and that gets boring very very fast. This game is in a terrible state, and I am astonished you have not made drastic changes (or preferably reversals) before you lose an entire fan base and the only successful game you’ve had.

I’ve died plenty of times in top 10 due to minigun being spammed. I get angry sometimes at the game but it’s usually because I died, but the minigun in solos is an actual thing I find unfair.

-It’s not like an smg where you need to aim well to hit your shots.

-Shotgun + smg can’t take the user down because the delay when switching weapons is enough time for the minigun to eliminate you.

-You can’t get the high ground against it because building is ineffective against it.

-Aiming in the general vicinity of the opponent with a minigun is enough to make sure your shots.

-Light ammo is very commonplace and there is no need to reload, so you can continuously start shooting. Unlike the smg.

The minigun is a fair weapon in duos and squads since the opponent’s teammates can focus on you while you’re destroying one of theirs. In 1v1 situations however, it’s a different story.

Almost every minute, the game will freeze for a good five seconds, sometimes resulting in us walking to our deaths. The overall game is laggy, and is very frustrating to play.

This error code means that the account you are attempting to log into has been disabled.  Accounts are disabled for one of the following reasons:

* The account owner requested that the account be disabled
* Fraud
* The account has been banned for misconduct in one of our games

Well I emailed them and someone named Callum responded with "" You have been observed using Cheats to gain an advantage against other players in Fortnite. One of our primary goals here at Epic is to foster a healthy and cooperative community for Fortnite. For this reason, this type of behavior is not tolerated. Due to the nature of your infraction, A permanent ban has been placed on your Epic Account.""

I have never cheated in any game, let alone Fortnite. I don't even know how to cheat nor do I really care. My stats are pretty trash and I literally play to have fun with others not to hurt other people by cheating. It's sad because no one is really going to believe me and it's pretty much impossible to convince most people, but I just want someone from Epic Games to manually look at what was flagged since I'm sure it must be a false positive or fake report. I've done nothing wrong and there's nothing on my system even remotely close to cheating (I mean I have Skyrim mods, but that's different)

Please someone at Epic Games, dm me and we can look at this together. I've spent hours and hours on my account and a lot of money for it to just be banned for no reason.

Emailing Epic doesn't seem to help since I don't think their CS can really help with these sorts of issues besides just reiterating what their script about bans says.",FortNiteBR

What they don't seem to understand is that making everything ""balanced"" doesn't make the game more skillful. It just means people will feel less helpless in certain situations and give them a way to NOT have to practice and learn skillful mechanics. I'm curious how this hasn't been addressed directly at this point? Considering this is far from exaggerating or plain out b****ing. This is a seriously game breaking state for me, someone who is a former competitive gamer as well as someone who has dumped over $300 bones into a free game. The things that made this game challenging and enjoyable seem to be getting nerfed into the ground. Instead we are creating a meta similar to COD, one of the most generic and uncreative games at this point in history. Literally anyone with hands could pickup a controller and get a kill the first time they play that game because it is a spray meta. A spray meta introduces more RNG not less and a BR needs to cut RNG anyway possible considering there is inherently more RNG due to the loot system, circles and dozens of other variables. I'm here to ask a question to everyone who has been around pre season 2; do you actually enjoy this meta and feel skill as you spray the enemy through their build with reckless abandon? This game seems to be literally taking an identical path as H1Z1 by tampering with the core mechanics.

Don't get me wrong, I have been impressed with epic and love their responsiveness, work ethic and creativity.... but change is not always good and I am getting the vibe from my friends and fellow gamers that a large chunk of people are going to stop loading up fortnite every afternoon after work like they usually do because they simply aren't having fun with the game in it's current state.

TLDR; I'm afraid the current state of the meta is going to drive off diehards from the playerbase and cause significant long term negative effects to the games popularity.",FortNiteBR

People don't like complaining and like constructive criticism instead, but the only solution I have is to revert every update they've had the passed 2 months lol. Unrealistic but the game was better before that developer update  where they stated ""we want to see other play styles implemented instead of just build lol"". The most tone deaf statement any developer has ever made. It's sad the state this game is in. Throw in bugs that never get fixed, ""bug fixes"" that are worse than the actual bug(ghost peeking, phasing through structures), and game crashes/freezes that are now constant and you have a recipe for a game that's headed for a decline.

While the burst takes 3 bullets per shot, it only shoots two. You cannot get 3 hit markers with one shot, at most you can get two. With that, the recoil makes it difficult to even hit with two bullets. The lack of damage and slow fire rate makes the burst a terrible gun to get in most situations",FortNiteBR

Just put a good amount of baby powder on your palms and finger tips and rub your hands together until the powder seems to disappear almost. Then you will be able to play without pausing every 10 minutes to wipe your hands.

&gt;Just to chime in here. We're trying to be careful with how we fix this (double pump), which is why it's taking a little bit longer. Shooting, reloading, weapon swapping, etc, are all critical gameplay systems. We don't want to accidentally make other areas worse just to fix this one issue :-).

Which I find ironic as the route they decided to take brought more problems/inconsistencies than solutions. Shotguns are awful, an interesting strat got completely ditched and the game's fluidity got worse with the pull out delays, and what is worse IMO is that instead of doing what they actually wanted to (making the meta wider) they replaced a meta for another one that is arguably worse.

Just remembered about this comment and found it hilarious. Peace ✌

I used to love the game, played it during a lot of my spare time but slowly played less and less and can now only say I’m a casual player. I play around 4-5 hours a week. 
It has got to a point where a literally can’t get a win any more, where I used to average around 1 in 7 games. Because of the popularity, obviously the standard of play has improvised dramatically, of which I can’t keep up with. 
It feels like now, the game is only catered towards the serious gamer, and it has totally ignored casual gamers. 
I feel like at this point there should be some sort of skill based match making system, so players like myself aren’t competing against those who play the game for hours every day. This way, everyone is happy as there is no hugely mismatched players. Every game is competitive, rather than the same few players winning most of the time. 
It has probably been suggested before, but just thought I’d give my opinion as the game is becoming far less enjoyable lately, and something needs to change in order to keep the interest of casual gamers like myself. ",FortNiteBR

Note: all calculations, notes and estimations are mine and are meant as very rough estimations to just give us an idea of this answer
* Map is on 10x10 grid 
* That’s 100 grid spaces 
* Each grid space could be replaced by a 50x50 grid of floors
* That’s 2,500 floors for one grid space 
* That’s 250,000 total floors on the grid (still grid, bit map)
* Each floor is 10 mats 
* That’s 2,500,000 total mats 
* It takes 360 mats to get to max height with ramps 
* Max inventory is 2,997 mats, but we’ll round down to 2970 because that’s the amount of usible mats. 
* Assuming you do that to get to the top every time, you have 2,610 mats to use for floors 
* That’s 261 floors per recollection of materials 
* You would need to collect materials 958 times 
* I assuming you have 3 other friends that’s 239 times for 2 people, and 240 times for the other 2
* In the playground LTM it takes me an average of 1:45 to max out on materials 
* That’s 420 minutes of collecting alone (I’m calculating for the 240 times to collect person because they would finish last)
* It took me an average of about 50 seconds to reach the top of the map with ramps (if you’re precise the time can decrease) 
* Going up 240 times will take you 200 minutes 
* We’re at 620 minutes of collecting and getting to the top of the map
* On average it took me 4 minutes to to deplete my remaining materials and build the floors 
* Doing this 240 times will take 960 minutes 
* When adding all the times together you will have spent 1,580 minutes, 26 hours and 20 minutes, or 1 day 2 hours and 20 minutes
* The time does not include the amount of running needed to get to different loot spots, spawn time, etc, just strictly what was mentioned. 
* And NOW we’ll start subtracting the grid spaces that don’t get used/the island doesn’t touch. 
* There are 11 grid spaces that the main island doesn’t touch (the SW corner near flush isn’t counted even though a little coastline does touch this space) 
* It’s an average of 15.8 minutes per grid space 
* That’s 173.8 minutes subtracted from the entire grid time 
* That’s 1,406.2 minutes, or 23.45 hours remaining
* Now that’s just using the amount of grid spaces that are used. Some spaces are not used to their entirety, and here’s where a ton of estimation comes in. 
* There are about 62 full grid spaces used (meaning no ocean or very little is used in the space) 
* The remaining edges take up about 13.5 grid spaces in total 
* That’s 75.5 grid spaces used 
* That’s 1,192.9 minutes, or 19.88 hours of work 
All of these numbers are estimated and should be taken with a grain of salt. It’s all just my own rough theoretical estimation. Theoretical because the playground LTM doesn’t last this long, I don’t know the landing times or roaming times from loot spot to loot spot, there might not even be enough loot in the first place, and ultimately who the fuck has the patience to do this? 

And if you skipped to the end for results here you go: 
VERY ROUGH ESTIMATED TIME TO COVER THE FORTNITE ISLAND WITH MATERIALS AT MAX HEIGHT IN THE PLAYGROUND LTM IS ABOUT 19.88 HOURS WITH 4 PEOPLE WORKING NONSTOP

They all build a great game everyone loves, gain a lot of attention for being good, ride the well deserved fame and being amazing devs, continue to add weird updates that nobody really wants, and only try to fix the game when another one rises up to take its top spot?

If I had to put a timeline on top BR games I would say it would be the arma mod, the culling, h1z1, pubg, fortnite. Although I've never played the mod so I can't speak for it, every game has followed this path. With PUBG being the most recent game falling down, most people might have seen this game as a shitty version of fortnite if they're new the BR genre. However, people who have been playing BR for years watched PUBG rise from the ashes of the burning H1Z1. It was praised for having amazing devs who truly cared about their game and always listened to the community. It was miles ahead of the current state H1Z1 in terms of fun, and millions bought the game. It was pretty obvious when PUBG peaked and the devs started to milk the game as much as they can. It was sad to see what was happening to my fav game but from the ashes of PUBG came fortnite.

So far the first half of the cycle has repeated itself. Don't get me wrong EPIC are great devs, but so were bluehole. I do like this game, but this game needs to survive. Battle Royale games are already going to die, so I seriously doubt any game could overtake this games popularity. When fortnite dies, BR dies. The only reason this game took over pubg is because of the building, remember that.

EPIC, I know you have visions on great gunplay, but that's not gonna happen, and it's not what made your game shine. People developed building to the point where it is because its one of the few things in the game that allows you to get better. Aim isn't worth the time to perfect in this game. You get no real benefit of having insane aim vs good aim, you're gonna miss shots no matter what. When you compare 2 players, aim doesn't have as large of impact as it should. For example, shroud has some of the best aim I've ever seen. It's snappy, precise, and ultimately unrewarding in fortnite. He's severely limited by his building, as he doesn't main fortnite. Although his aim is superior than any other top player, he isn't rewarded in game for it due to bloom.

Shotguns we're at least consistent. Why would I risk the chance of bloom when I could ramp rush and get the kill. Getting kills at 75+ meters is fairly common in other shooters, but not this game because guns aren't reliable at that distance except for snipers and scoped AR's (guns without bloom). So how could EPIC possibly fix the weapon imbalance? Nerf the shit out of the shotguns that's how. Now I'm not gonna cry about the shotguns, everyone else already has, but there really is no counter to SMGs and drum guns. You can't outbuild, you can't shotgun due to pull out time, you can't back out and shoot from a distance because of bloom. Not fun my dude.

**TL;DR** every BR game does the same shit and if fortnite doesn't stop the cycle the genre will die.",FortNiteBR

You had to actually hit your shots to get kills rather than spray your nuts off. Made build battles an actual thing. I haven’t had a legit build battle since s4 because every time you start building up you get sprayed down instantly because wood walls are about as durable as cardboard. The current meta has no counters other than using the same exact load-out as everyone else, and even then luck still plays a large part in whether or not you’ll win most fights. With the double shotgun meta, at least you were able to counter it with building. The gameplay felt a thousand times more smooth back then. Everything had a counter. Wtf are you supposed to do when a squad full of mini guns runs up and makes it rain? I understand double pump and double heavy were somewhat OP, but nerfing those two combos while still allowing us to use a pump with a tac/heavy would be ideal. I like to play aggressive, and the only way to do that currently is to run as many spam weapons and explosives as possible. I wish there were options, I’m tired of running the same damn load-out every single game because nothing else is nearly as effective as the meta. ",FortNiteBR

I immediately contacted Epic games to no avail. I changed my password to something i never used before and made it unique, also enabled two factor authorization at the suggestion of the Epic games forum pages. Everything was fine for a week.

The morning of patch 5.10 i tried to log in and my password didnt work. When i tried to reset the password through epic games with my login email, I received no email. I play on PC but started on PS4. So after sending epic multiple emails, trying to call, essentially going through all the suggest avenues i re-linked my ps4 account to my epic games account seeing if could circumvent the problem. After a while i was able to get back on to my account but all my skins and and all my vbucks were gone. Although I now use the login email from my ps4 account rather than my original Epic games email somehow. I have been playing since season 1 and had all the ""OG"" skins and cosmetics. Needless to say I am distraught at the loss. My CC company told me someone tried to charge 100 dollars to the account but didnt have the CV credit card code or correct address since i recently moved and they denied the charge.

My question is, are there any mods or fortnite employees that can help? I have spent literally 100's of dollars and 100's of hours on this game and i've lost everything and im not even sure how its possible to wipe out all my cosmetics and still have my same name on the game, just a different login email. Please? Anyone help? I'd really appreciate any help. Thanks guys.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite was a big reason I finally make the switch from console (Xbox) to pc. So far it’s been great, but my biggest problem has to be the default Keybindings and how uncomfortable they are.

Since only like 5% of players seem to understand this concept and I thought this clip showcased the power of double layers of protection and how to take high ground against spray.

He starts out in 1x1 with a floor on top tfue clips him once through the floor so he throws up the pyramid.  tfue instantly stops spraying the top because you will get ZERO damage through 2 layers of protection.  He moves to the side but this competent opponent is ready with the ramp so tfue stops spraying there as well.  Since tfue has no options to break in he doesn't spray and his opponent edits out the top to try to take high ground.  Tfue tries to spray him down but despite what some people say, building still works.

You can defend against spray and you can take high ground while someone is spraying even if that someone is tfue.  

tldr: use double layers, don't die to spam

* Bunny Brawler

I would play every single day. I've heard so many things about why these skins should never be brought back and I think there are alternatives.

&gt; It's disrespectful to rerelease the old skins to the older players.

I completely DON'T agree. There are many other ways we could give ""respect"" to older players. Fortnite could give them an exclusive skin for people who started before Season 2. Just because an older player has an old and rare skin doesn't mean it can't be available to others who weren't there during that time period.

&gt; It shouldn't be put back in the shop because it's too rare!

Most people don't buy cosmetics because of ""rarity."" Most people purchase them because they look appealing. A lot of people, like myself, enjoy the way some skins look. The opportunity to purchase the older skins should not be based on what people who have the skin think. It is a *cosmetic* that grants no in-game advantage, it's just a cosmetic that makes playing a bit more unique and fun. I don't know how to say selfish in a nicer way, but yep. That's what I think of people who have the skins already. I think that the only reason that people who own the skins would get mad if it came back to shop is that they like to flaunt them. Personally, I think it's unfair that we can't get those skins because I know somebody who really likes Power Chord, but they weren't there at the time to get it. This person is under 18 and still lives with their parents who took away his PC while that skin was out. He had enough v-bucks, he knew he wanted the skin through youtube, and he lost his chance based on it being ""rare"" to others who own it. As the title states, #BringBackRareSkins.

I would love to have a discussion with y'all but please be mature.

Now in order for this all to make sense... Let's go back to January 2018. This is when the shotgun swap delay update was implemented. This update was fine, and I'm sure not a lot of players were complaining about it because you could still one-tap people, even though using it in close-quarters did get nerfed a little. Now we jump forward to June 6th, 2018. This is when Epic Games really started pushing it... they reduced the actual damage the shotguns in Fortnite do.

Here are the exact patch notes regarding the shotgun nerf:

* **Pump Shotgun**  

   * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
   * Damage reduced from 90/95 to 80/85
* **Tactical Shotgun**  

   * Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0

Now what that did is that before, pumps would headshot crit. for 225/237. Now, they would crit. for 160/170. I believe us skilled-in-shotguns players would appreciate if we could one tap again if we have our crosshairs right on a player's head, instead of hitting 160/170 (and that is not even consistent, I've hit less than 100 dmg with a headshot crit.) Besides, I'm pretty sure if someone had 5-6 pellets in their noggin they would instantly die.

Now... I will introduce the absolute bane of Fortnite's existence. The current SMG/spam meta. And I say current because It could still be a viable meta, but it would be better for the health of the game if it got nerfed even further. Maybe keep the damage it does to players but reduce the damage it does towards structures? This meta encompasses everything I've already listed, PLUS explosives and SMGs, here's the patch notes (Keep note, I will exclude vaulted items or patched updates)

**Silenced SMG**

* Increased base accuracy by 10%.
* Increased ADS accuracy bonus by 20%.
* Increased damage by +2.

**Shotguns**

* Shotgun damage to structures has been reduced by 50% for Pump Shotgun, and 25% for both Tactical Shotgun and Heavy Shotgun.

In Season 5, a change was implemented that completely got rid of double shotgunning. Players now have to wait 2 seconds before another shotgun shot could be fired. That's fine to me. But the shotguns are still a bit weak.

Epic Games supposedly wants to combat turtling in competitive and casual environments by implementing these absolute over-exaggerations, however it's really unproductive and...unfun. Solo squads are almost impossible now with this current meta. Epic, please. Fix this. revert shotgun damage back, nerf the SMG's just a little, or dont. It's fine. Just bring back the double shotgun back please.

P.S I know I'm not crazy because a lot of big influences/pro players in the community have voiced their opinion about the game in it's current state and it's not favoring the current meta (i.e Ninja, TFue, Faze Cloak, TSM Daequan)",FortNiteBR

We're all more happy with the product than this sub would have you believe.  Just think they need to take a breather for a week or 2, press pause on throwing 4 more guns and 3 more LTMs at us, and polish up the baseline/core mechanics and balances of the game.  They aren't far off, but it's a little wobbly right now.  I won't list all the baseline mechanics issues - Epic is well aware of them as are the rest of us.  Its not an easy thing for them to do as the dump-trucks full of cash keep backing in by the minute.  But the game sorely needs some baseline maintenance and sanding down of some rough edges.  

Additionally, I think Epic needs to put some money aside to fund a black-market kill squad for people who use KBM on console.  If you use a KBM on console for any other reason than some kind of disability - I hope your afterlife consists of being put into a small room with a big, plush, shag carpet that's filled with random pieces of legos you can't see and you're forced to stomp around it continuously for all eternity.",FortNiteBR

What really has me bothered is that for weeks now he has been asking for money to get Vbucks? and something about a Wingman suit? It's driving my spouse and I crazy.

If you somehow died to double pump during the end and start of season 5, it might've been your own skill level. Why do I say this? Because it was more efficient to run pump smg instead of double pump. Only the truely good players were still slaying out with double pump, and more than likely they instead ran a smg regardless. 

  
Instead now, you have the exact same issue. You can only run a gun + a smg, shotguns are arguably useless. You can technically run a smg and splodes loadout only if you wanted, etc.

Ghost peeking? If your camping in 1 by 1 and not pushing what do you expect to happen. Even if they peeked you on a fair level, you would've still got lasered(Not to say ghost peeking was balanced) its just that my point is that maybe you were still going to lose the battle, regardless of what you died from.

Solo mode is the mode Epic uses to balance the game, and is the main game type.  So your complaint should be less towards the guns and instead either play solo and see it’s not as bad as you think, or campaign for augmented damages for these party game modes.

Now, this “spray” meta everyone is whining about. It simply doesn’t exist, period. Smgs are not the strongest or best weapons, but they now are competitive at close to close/mid range. But the truth is, shotgun headshots and pistol spam both easily can demolish an smg. Scars also can destroy them if you get a headshot or two, but no one complains about a mid/long range weapon outclassing a close range weapon.  SMGs were overpowered for what, a day? Now they feel pretty balanced. The drop off is huge at distance so you can’t “laser” people. The p90 and smg proper are both fast shooting but inaccurate. The drum gun is more accurate but fires slower, shotguns can easily counter. I just feel smgs haven’t been viable for so long, people just arnt used to them being used. Our minds try to find reasons for outcomes we don’t like or understand, so something new is an easy target.

The building nerf is a long time coming but just as viable as always without be an infinity shield.  Building should be for just that, building, not shields how they are mostly used. I’d be all for a mat buff on completed walls, but i think a new wall just placed should easily break to a bullet or two or have some pass through with reduced damage. When fully constructed they would (and are) much stronger, people are just so used to building spam, they don’t want to adapt to having to actually think about what you’re doing, rather then muscle memory spam of your turtle shell.

I know many people agree with me, and if you don’t you still really need to chill out. People are out of control on this forum whining and insulting anyone who try’s to explain to them why things are different and how they can adapt. Because the fact of the matter is that’s what you have to do, adapt. There is no game breaking gun, buff or nerf currently. The game is in a good balance with minor tweaking needed to fully balance it out.  

This fits with Epics idea of catering to multiple play styles, because now there actually are multiple ways to win a fight other then being forced to do the same thing over and over to win.

Anyhow feel free to disagree, but let’s keep it constructive eh?",FortNiteBR

You've got your guns and some mats and now you're ready to get into the battle. Aaaaaaaaand sniped. It's okay! I'm surrounded by teammates you say. Surely one of these kind souls values my contribution to the team and the time I've spent gathering mats and items... Enough to build a pyramid over me and wait for me to die. Cool, I'm basically a loot-chest that has to watch this clown dance for 100 seconds to be opened. This game is Fu-  


Yes! a kind stranger has stopped and broken the pyramid and is reviving me to the dismay of this evil graverobber. 10-9-8-7-I'm gonna make it!-6-5-4-I'm gonna win this for my team when I get up!-3-2-IMPULSE GRENADE! The good samaritan and I are pushed apart, and to my dismay, he turns around and runs away, unwilling to spend another 10 seconds to keep me in the fight while unable to stop Mr. Impulse troll. I finally die. The impulse grenade throwing lifeguard loots my body and moves on to his next victim.  


It feels like 90% of players are unwilling to revive anyone in 50vs50. Hell, I've played regular squad with randos and have had teammates wait for me to die to take my mats and items. People would still barely revive if the experience reward was increased by 1000%. I didn't buy the battlepass, so experience means absolutely nothing to me this season. Not to mention all the players not reviving because they are bitter about not being revived in previous matches.  


I propose a fool-proof plan to get 90% of that 90% back on the teamwork bus and end those feel bad moments entirely. If revives came with a few V-bucks, players would be lining up to revive players, instead of constantly passing them up or trolling while waiting for them to die. 5 V-bucks is small enough to not hurt store profits, but large enough to actually incentivize players to play like a team. People would definitely try to abuse this with a friend, so I think a once per player limit would be prudent. Buffing EXP just isn't enough. People without the battlepass couldn't care less about EXP, but everyone wants V-bucks. Not only would this promote teamwork and remove feel bad moments where you're looking around desperately futilely for a helpful teammate, it would get more people playing the game more, as current reward systems for gameplay are almost non-existent.",FortNiteBR

They said something like when you get a smg off the start and you’re shooting someone and doing 8 there’s no reason why a pickaxe should be doing more damage than a gun. This gave me an idea, I’ve always told my friends there’s no reason why shotguns should be doing 7 damage on a shot. They always said well there’s a spread on the shot, but with the new reticle on shotguns showing how many bullets hit the person my idea would work pretty good. I thought they should have each bullet hit for a certain damage. So say you hit a person and only one red dot appears, that’s 10 damage (or whatever the math would be). But if you hit them with every bullet and it’s in the head it should be 200 damage. Idk what damages would be balanced for that idea but to me it’s better than what we have now. And now for the current smg meta. I see tons of people complaining how this meta sucks and they want the pumps to be fixed and blah blah blah. I for one still think the pump is a valuable gun and it now takes skill to use it because of the delays. It took skill to use double pump and it takes skill to use the pump now. Epic wanted noobs to be able to kill people and have a chance to win so the smgs being so powerful makes sense for that. People can spray and pray and kill someone but every shooting game is like that. I play on pc and me and my friend have been running without shotguns all week and we have been having tons of fun.

Fortnite used to be fun but im actually done with this game. I've been playing since season 1 and the meta is just getting worse. The skillgap in fortnite makes it impossible to win unless you are a pro. The meta is just spamming and spamming. You nerf building and you buff the smgs to the point where you can kill someone with 200 hp from 20 meters in less than a second. (im not kidding, look at the dps for smg and that is only with bodyshot) This game doesnt require skill anymore. Its purely rng and even the double pump isnt as op as the fucking smg metas. Its not only this clip thats the reason im pissed. I had 200 hp before entering the fight and he was with the boat when he hit me to 32. And another player just comes in.

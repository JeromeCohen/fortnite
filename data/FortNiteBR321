They give everyone a banner? Why is this being accepted as *competitive* play. You are likely not going to win big rewards as its made to seem. This game would break the gaming industry yet again if they just considered actually rewarding players for putting significant time into the game and as well as skill based rewards. But this one twitch streamer gets 75k vbucks is not helping anyone enjoy the game more. Just go all in and reward players you will still make money.

TL;DR - players should be able to earn vbucks from wins or something more likely than this lottery based bullshit",FortNiteBR
3,FruitPuunch,1528052455,8oasde,33,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8oasde/why_the_skull_trooper_might_return_next_halloween/,4,Why the skull trooper might return next halloween.,"Almost everyone playing Fortnite who does not own the ‚ÄúSkull Trooper‚Äù skin is just begging for it to return. After months of waiting for it to return in the shop we came to the conclusion that it would remain season 1 exclusive. I did some digging and i think there is a chance we will catch this skin next Fortnitemares AKA halloween season.

You may have seen this tweet before, the one stating that the skull trooper will be coming out for the ‚ÄúLast Time‚Äù, 

[Fortnite Skull Trooper And Ghoul Trooper Tweet](https://imgur.com/gallery/SNzXb5L)

But take a closer look. Fortnitemares is a halloween event. Halloween happens every year (obviously) so doesn‚Äôt that mean Fortnitemares will return next halloween? There you go, your catching on. To top off this theory, in the tweet it states that the skins are coming out for the ‚Äúlast time this Fortnitemares‚Äù. Keyword ‚ÄúThis‚Äù, thats right, the way it is worded they are suggesting it will return next halloween because they only said it was coming out for the last time THIS Fortnitemares. Sorry halloween skin owners, your skin will no longer classify you as an OG player. The only skins that will are the Dark Night, the Red Night and the Renegade Raider. That is unless Fortnite decides to release them in shop.

Recently dloaded the game to play with my younger cousin as we have no games in common and i promised him to download FN. We live quite a bit apart so i really would like to play with him every now and then. However, he is quite invested into the game and has the drive to it, so i'd like to improve my gameplay. 

Ive never really played Battle Arena games before so im quite bad at it. Aiming is different to the games i play and the scavenging system is new as well. 

So to sum it all up, i would be really glad if someone had a tutorial or a few tips on how to git gud in the game. Not pro-level style good, but decend enough to stand your ground and maybe even win a round once in a blue moon!

John Wick was attainable too easily last season. *Not everything should be attainable for a player who logs in once a week to do his Challenges. There needs to be a system that rewards dedicated players.* This is good.

That being said, I really dislike how the Omega grind doesn¬¥t factor in performance during the game properly. As of right now, it¬¥s just about putting a ridiculous time into the game, not about being a good player. I can just drop, get a kill or two, avoid firefights up to endgame to rack up the survival time XP and rinse and repeat. As long as I sit in front of the PC every day I get it, regardless of my performance. I personally dislike it. 

What needs to be done to change it? I personally would love to see 2 things:

**1) Rework the XP progression system:** Make kills matter more. If I get a 9 kill game, I should get *significantly* more XP than someone who got 3 kills. Introduce more sources of XP in the game, such as looting chests, dealing damage etc. Maybe even put in XP streaks for getting high kill games in a row. Make XP progression be a gauge of performance instead of just time.

**2) Introduce actual Challenges in addition to Level Grind:** I personally really enjoyed the Wick Glider Challenges last season. It was something I had to go out of my way to complete and they were a bit harder than regural challenges. Make them even harder with Omega Challenges, like getting kills in multiple locations during a single game, get a win, get kills with X different weapons in a single game etc. Actual achievements that need a skilled person to complete, instead of just putting in a lot of time.

With those 2 changes, we would have a balanced reward system, which still needs you to put in quite a bit of time into the game, but it rewards you for being a better player and requires you to go out of your way to *achieve* something.",FortNiteBR

Has anyone else had this issue? Am I missing something, my friends said that their free challenges from the beginning of the season might‚Äôve counted towards weekly, is that possible to anyone who knows?

The Jetpack was brought out as a limited time item, like the ltms and as we know, every week there is a new ltm, unless it's 50v50 because that mode doesn't want to leave. 

Back to the point, the jetpack ruins the skill ceiling of the game and I would be fine with it if it was only in close encounters or was gone in the latest update, but it wasn't. They added it to the main game and most of the time I die in top 10 it's because of a jetpack.

You might make a joke and say ""just build lol"" but I've seen great builders get destroyed by rust lords who fly up with the jetpack with 0 skill and get a lucky pump. 

This game is based on luck when it comes to loot, but what you do with the loot is 100% skill. But a jetpack kinda ruins this in my opinion, you don't need to be able to build, just fly lol!

Blitz showdown is full of tryhards, the problem is that if they have a jetpack and you don't you're very likely to lose. Especially since everyone in this gamemode is running 2x pump.

When I first heard of the jetpack I assume it would be pretty much to gain high ground and avoid fall damage, which in my opinion it already makes the jetpack very powerful. Being able to use 2x pump while floating and keep gaining the enemy high ground is veru OP.

Tfue and other streamers have agreed that it needs to go.

I say either nerf it to where you cant shoot while using it or remove it.

There is no point in trying to win the high ground since they can just float and pump you.",FortNiteBR

I think the best solution to this is to change the way shotguns shoot: after the player presses the button to fire, the character pumps the shotgun before firing. Now, instead of being able to one-shot some poor soul the moment he rounds a corner, you would have to keep the crosshairs on him for half a second, something that would take serious skill to do. In addition, you can't shoot someone the moment they peek out of their base, giving more if a reason to use other weapons that instantly fire in close-range combat such as SMGs and tacs. Not only would this shift up the meta, it would turn the pump shotgun from the gun every noskin without an ounce of skill wins fights with to a weapon that is hard to master but destructive once you do. 

TLDR: Giving the shotgun a delay before firing would make it a more skill based weapon and balance in out against other close-range options.

Just because something won't be in the game forever doesn't mean it can't deserve a quicker removal. If the guided missile was brought back as a limited time item for the duration of the Jetpack, would you be okay with it? Didn't think so.

Anyway, the jetpack inherently rewards bad play in **MOST** cases. In some, it can be used very well if the player is skilled. But in most, it rewards lousy building; this game isn't supposed to do that. In my opinion, fortnite is special because of its building but the jetpack allows players to quickly steal high ground without having much building skill. 

To me, this is a huge problem. Building is supposed to be at the center of this game but jetpacks contradict that idea. 

Please remove the jetpack soon. ",FortNiteBR

Wood/Brick/Steel piles as usual

I think this would help with that issue of being defenseless, also with the issue of landing in a hot drop and getting a legendary mini gun or legendary hand cannon etc. with the more weapons that release this could make chests an even more valuable commodity without jeopardizing game balancing as it‚Äôs only throwing in a grey weapon.

And i really want to reach level 100, but there is literally no reward for it. As soon as one reaches level 80, there are no rewards left to get. You get to level 80, unlock the full Omega set and the last 20 levels have more than half of the season xp in them, which means that basically half of your season xp is for nothing.

According to my calculations \(if they are wrong, please let me know\) you need approximately 17.5K XP per day to reach level 100 in Season 4, which is an extreme amount of XP per day to grind for, if there is no reward for it.

Firstly, i want to know what you think about that and if you think it is an issue, because i really think it is.  
My solution for it would be something like a new color for Omega, or even a new skin if you reach level 100.  
To be honest, even a pickaxe would be enough, just to show that you reached level 100.

There's a lot of hate between the two playerbases. Both referring to the other one as inferior. Fortnite players seen to see PUBG as an unfinished mess, while PUBG players seem to see Fortnite as a childish ripoff.

I mean, I own both games. If I had to choose, I don't think I could. Not because they're both equally good in my eyes (I think PUBG is better pound for pound) but because they aren't all that similar at all.

Fortnite is a really cartoonish, floaty game in the same vein as Team Fortress, while PUBG relies on the gameplay of Arma, which makes it more grounded and stiff.

Good fortnite players work off of good quick trigger reflexes and creativity, trying to push the limits of the what the game allows, while PUBG players rely on the ability to play previous first person shooters and such.

The amount of hostility between both respective playerbases is really annoying and almost pathetic. I hate having to hear people talk my ear off when they hear I prefer one of the games over another, and I feel like it should stop.

It's midnight where I'm at so sorry for any mispellings or general mistakes. Both games have been super fun to play and have eaten up all of my free time recently. Thanks again!",FortNiteBR

For that reason, C4 is one of my favorite things to get ahold of. I usually set it up and use it as a distraction.

But, what would make it even better is if you could also get ahold of security cameras. Imagine setting up a camera that looks just like the other cameras in the game, and being able to tap into a feed whenever you want? A small screen could appear at the bottom left that you could access at any moment. Maybe you could use it just to see if anyone is around that location. Or, you could also attach C4 near the security camera and activate it whenever someone's around.

I‚Äôm sure most people see the amount of replies on Fortnite‚Äôs tweets asking for certain skins back into the shop, such as Red Knight, Skull Trooper, etc. 

Here‚Äôs my idea: In the settings tab, there could be a ‚ÄúSecond Chance‚Äù feature that allows you to select any skin that was in the shop at a point you played at.

It would cost 1,000 V-Bucks to use the feature, all the cosmetics that you purchased using the feature would cost the same amount of V-bucks, and you‚Äôd only be able to use Second Chance once. 

I think there would be a lot of people that would like this feature as they could‚Äôve not had money at the time if the skins release. 

Hopefully they add this, because they would make so much money from this.

You can carry one, and then get double pumped, or pump-taced in the face, or you can carry two and get to leave behind other things you would actually like to use as well, say a sniper or meds.. I know ultimately it comes down to aim, and when i am using two shotguns, i normally never have an issue, but thats the thing, i am just done carrying too, but i am automatically at a disadvantage in every game because everyone is running around with two, its a lose lose situation.",FortNiteBR

So yeah I understand that it's meant for some of the best players that Fortnite brings in, but for those of us who aren't up in the bracket? What then? Don't participate?

I'm not horrible or amazing at the game, I can get a few wins everyday if I really try with 5-10 kills. But this is almost absurd with how it does just throws you in with people. Usually that is how Fortnite can operate and it'll be just fine but going into this it's all under one group of people and that's the best.

I guess really what I'm trying to get at is that I would just love it if we, the casual but fairly decent players, got something for our level of skill and then down ladder for those people. Not saying someone who just started playing yesterday should be able to win some V-Bucks but for people with decent skill can we at least get a basic spray? How about like the Solo Showdown spray but in different colors depending on how we did. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, etc. 

Overall, just wish there was something more for other players other than the best who seem to have all the time in the world to play. And yeah, after being straightened out and reading this I can understand that a lot of this can easily be argued but I spent 15 minutes writing this so I didn't want to throw away what seemed like a good laugh to me.",FortNiteBR

We all know that in pub G you can get head shot punches that do a little extra damage 

Without trying to copy that idea entirely I thought about this variation for fortnite

Similar to when you are harvesting from a tree or a rock, critical points would randomly appear on players when melee combat happens 

This would really spice up those early game landings where you don't have a weapon but you see another player and he sees you 

It would also give unarmed people a fighting chance to win a melee battle. as it is right now if your opponent has a gun and you don't, the only way to beat him is if hes on mobile.

So yeah when you hit the critical spot it'll do a little extra damage and then move to a new location on the person. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

Hi noobs, I'm u/bosilk!

I'm 18 years old and am from the MIGHTY United Kingdom (EU pleb). I'm an avid gamer, mainly on the xbox one, who's been playing Fortnite since around September. Just like the rest of the world I fell in love with Fortnite BR and have been playing it since, picking up a few Victory Royales here and there but mostly my games consist of being outplayed by a noskin.
I spend most of my free time either on Fortnite or Rocket League so feel free to hit me up if you ever want to play.

I'm also pursuing a career in the Royal Air Force as an ICT Technician which I'm now in the final stages for however don't worry as after a short time away in August I'll be back to my usual obsessive activity.

I hope to see you on the battlebus!

Thank you to all 832 of you that submitted applications for the latest round, we were incredibly impressed with the quality of the applicant pool! You can see our recent subreddit traffic stats [in our moderator recruitment post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8jwu1d/new_moderator_recruitment/).

This time around, we have decided to nearly double our previous moderation team bringing on 11 new mods, with these new moderators having a heavy focus on modqueue/modmail. Please welcome fellow STW mods /u/Necrologyx, /u/WindAeris, /u/sexualrhinoceros and new mods /u/PlexversalHD, /u/XplosiveCows, /u/HereticxAnthem, /u/Snaacky, /u/BeardyDuck, /u/bosilk, /u/jesuspunk, and /u/Dubstep4Moms! (Dubstep4Moms had to make a new account because his previous account name was... quite NSFW)

Previously, because of the thousands of posts a day, we would often get up to a day behind on unmoderated (posts that we haven't manually gone over) and hundreds of modmails behind, leading to a lot of spam, low effort content, and long wait times for inquiries about the subreddit. However, we hope that with the help of the new mods, response times to reports and modmails should be reduced significantly!

#Various Announcements

**Rule Revisions**

- We are in the process of revising our rules and clarifying some, which should help reduce the amount of generally low effort content on the subreddit. Please stay tuned!

**Competitive Subreddit**

- Our competitive/esports subreddit, /r/FortniteCompetitive, should be open to the public next week. We also ran our first match megathread yesterday with the Fortnite Friday tournament, and we would love feedback on how we can improve those in the future!

**FortniteBRMeta Subreddit**

- A week ago, we announced /r/FortniteBRMeta as an outlet for discussions about the subreddit specifically and not Fortnite itself, such as rule discussions and feedback. Please check it out and use that for any feedback or subreddit questions/inquiries!

**Reminder to Report Posts and Comments**

- With thousands of posts and **comments** a day, we can't see them all. If you see any posts and **comments** that you think break the rules found at /r/FortniteBR/wiki/rules, please report them! This allows us to see the offending post/comment and take appropriate action. Thanks! (pls help with comments. They're hard to see)

However everyone being able to carry a 1 shot boomstick is severely hurting the game and is creating a stale meta.

Because of the capability of a one pump, sub machine guns and heavy shotguns aren't used.

I think the pump shotgun and the heavy tac need their stats switched so not everyone is running around with a one shot.

This will bring sub machine guns into the meta and the heavy shot guns will be a viable carry as opposed to where they are now.

The problem isn't so much that they're leaving, its WHY they're *actually* leaving. 

Fortnite, being one of those *sweep the nation, everyone's playing it* kind of games, brings millions of extremely low teir players to everyone's matches. Some so bad you honestly question whether they've ever played a game before in their life. Better players know this, and prefer to leave before the match starts so they don't get stuck with the dreaded ""pickaxe out-and walking everywhere"" type of player. 

I dismissed all of the random and absurd ""Pay to Win""  claims until experiencing this so often. In a way, unless you've got a skin, the likelihood of any decent player staying with you is significantly less than if you had one. I'm no pro, but I'm in the high above average crowd for sure. I would just like to have matches that werent so black and white, so often; bad and stay, or good and leave. Now sure, Ive met plenty of people with skins that are horrible, but I think as a general rule of thumb skins show that you take this game more seriously and didnt just download Fortnite on your mom's iPhone after watching Fortnite Funny Moments in the back of the bus with your first grade friends. 

What, if anything can be done to mitigate this?

Right now, I hardly see any constructive discussions about the game making it to front page. The sub is filled with shit posts like ""double pump too OP pls nerf"", ""suggestion: never make red knight skin back in store again"" and ""Will I reach lv 80 omega by the end of season?"". Just imagine how frustrating new players or people looking to improve are, when their post asking for help gets 1-2 low effort ""just build"" replies from players probably perform even worse than them.  


The worst thing is, Epic's decision on game play does get influenced by this subreddit's reaction. I would hate for game items to be removed or meta to be changed purely because too many people cried on Reddit. Think about it, if you have a K/D of 2 and considers yourself an ""average player"", then there are over 300,000 people here who can't even get over 2 K/D. That is a lot of people! Judging from the low quality ""nerf this, remove this"" posts based on nothing but anecdotal ""this happened to me last game"" evidence, I would say the majority of complaints here on this subreddit is made by people who aren't good at the game.

 Recently however, I feel like the sub is an absolute shit-hole of complaints.  I came to this sub to look at really cool skin suggestions that the creator put his heart and soul into it, but know I see‚ÄùJet-Packs are too OP‚Äù, ‚ÄúNerf the Pump (Have not had a problem since day one)‚Äù, ‚ÄúThis almost unusable if you can build double pump killed me‚Äù each 16 times a day.
     
     So I, a lowly Reddit user, will break down these issues

 **Jet-Pack**:  A small part of me agrees that the jetpack is broken, but for the most part I think it‚Äôs fine.  **People seem to forget that ceilings are a thing.  Building ceilings forces the jetpack user  to go down to your level making it easier to handle them** so stop trying to outbuild it, it‚Äôs very possible to outbuild however the median age of this sub is 8year old complainers that don‚Äôt have the finger dexterity to build fast.

 **Nerf the Pump**:  In a way the already have with the most recent patch by **changing the headshot spot to just the head making it harder to land a 225 or 237 headshot**.  Honestly, just cause you got pumped in the head my a lucky no skin doesn‚Äôt mean the pump, that‚Äôs been here since day 1, needs a change.

 **Double Pump is to OP**:  Apparently people don‚Äôt know how to adapt is certain situations, like the jetpack you need to stop trying to fight offensively and start going on the defensive.  It‚Äôs as simple as building a damn wall people, you know how slow the fucking double pump is now? **Build a wall and they have to use 4/10 shots to break the wall not to mention the slow weapon delay of one pump when they have to build.**

 **TL;DR**:  People need to learn how to adapt to certain situations and stop complaining about it on reddit",FortNiteBR

Now by granting players points for kills, the core purpose of the game to be the last one alive is meaningless, because the difference between coming second and winning is the equivalent of two kills.

Not only does this draw away from the purpose of the game, but it enforces playstyles upon users and one of the best things about this game was that you could play how you wanted.

The tournament right now is literally a game of who can find the most players in the shortest amount of time, a factor which largely is down to luck.

* Do not go for kills
* Go for wins
* **DO NOT** drop in a populated area, you should be trying to go somewhere where there's no people.
* Try landing at locations with no name, but be sure they're in the circle or really close to it. - ex: Motel
* Find as many launch pads as you can.
* Farm as much as you can
* Try to find as many shields as you can.
* Shotguns needed.
* When you get close to end-game, hide behind hills or trees in a 1x1.
* if someone sees you and starts shooting at you, this is when the materials you farmed are important, just keep re-building everything he destroys - if he comes close to you and he doesn't leave, you eventually have to fight him - this is why you should hide from everyone.
* You can also use the launch pad and go where you don't see enemies, and then camp there.
* at the last circles, or even at the last one keep hiding and wait untill there's 3 left or 2.
* then you just fight the last one, it's good to attack him after he's done fighting with the other guy because he's going to have to reload the weapons and heal up.



And for the people who are going to say that this is a pu**y strategy, remember, it's a contest, no matter how much of a chicken you are, you still get the V-bucks in the end.

Last season we had some really cool skins like - Dark Voyager - Elite Agent and even the first skins that you got , Moonwalker and Mission Specialist looked super good.

But this season the only 2 decent skins in this BP are the ones that you need to grind for... Yes I am talking about Omega and Carbide. They both look good - but they only look good if you basically nolife the game 24/7. The first skin you get is Battlehawk - this skin just looks horrible the mashup of the colors and his hair is absolutely disgusting.

Teknique is definitely the best out of all the skins you get without grinding.

Zoey - oh boy, this skin is basically the Rust Lord of this season. But an uglier version of the rust lord the hair is horrible and her clothing is even worse.

Valor is a decent looking skin but let's be real here - who is going to keep using it after they get the next skin?

Squad Leader - This doesn't look like a tier 87 skin it's basically a decent looking version of Battlehawk.

Yup thats it. IMO this BP is not worth your money unless you can really grind.

With only this match to judge (After watching the fight replay) what I saw was a player constantly building for high ground emulating a ninja playstyle without really achieving much, he just kept building and building without actually engaging me in a fight bar the rare times he'd stop 40 feet in the air to finally take a shot whilst I've just finished knocking down the base of his ramp.

I had my 5.1 Sennheiser on and for roughly 20 minutes while crouched on the roof I would hear non stop gun shots, foot steps and things being built right under me. My plan was \(only thing I could really do\) was to wait for the gun shots and footsteps to stop and to them dig out the roof and try to find some weps.

\_\_\_

A little while ago version 5 of the State of Development was released \(\[see here\]\([https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en\-US/news/state\-of\-development\-v5](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-v5)\)\). I got excited once I saw \*\*Controller\*\* at the very top of the page, shortly followed by a bit of a let down to be honest. Let me explain why...

As a long time console shooter fan, be it FP or TP, I've had to deal with some rather uncomfortable shooting controls over the years. Seeing the recent development in console shooters for offering \*Advanced control settings\* \(e.g. Overwatch, Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, etc.\), I was fully expecting to see these added to Fortnite in a timely manner. Hence, my disappointment when the section Controller in the State of Development focused heavily on building mechanics and improvements. Don't get me wrong, these were well\-needed and appreciated of course! 

Currently, the options for control setting are rather limited. There are 4 control schemes available; Old School/Standard, Quick Builder, Combat Pro and Builder Pro, with the last one being vastly superior in my opinion. Add the \*Custom Bindings\*, that are currently in development, to the equation and we should be golden in the \*\*control bindings\*\* department. This leaves us with the \*\*aim/look controls\*\*. 

At time of wrinting the following \(relevant\) features are available for aim setting customization

\- Controller sensitivity X/Y

\- Scoped sensitivity

\- Aim down sight \(ADS\) sensitivity

\- Aim assist \(on/off\)

Obviously, this is very limited. Let me first list the features that should be added, and quite frankly, should be industry \*standards\* \(Or even better, make them PS/XBOX settings. But that is another story\)

\- Aim assist strength slider

 \- to determine how 'sticky' the aim assist is

\- Aim assist window slider

 \- to indicate where the aim assist kicks in around a hit box. Note: this should definitly scale well with distance!

\- Aim smoothing slider

 \- the amount of 'delay' for stick input to reach the actual turn rate governed by the response curve

\- Dead zone \(inner and outer\) slider

 \- to determine the 'responsiveness' of the stick movement

\- Response curve creation

 \- the relation between stick input and aim output

 \- currently some \(hand\-drawn?\) exponential curve

 \- possibly like this \(\[Aim response curve creator\]\([https://imgur.com/a/3rTsVay](https://imgur.com/a/3rTsVay)\)\) 

Lastly I'd like to discuss the current aim assist system, which in my opinion is really weird. Rather than it just being a window of lower sensitivity \('sticky'\), it currently has some pull towards the center of mass of an object that enables aim assist, while going into ADS. This can be heavily abused by spamming ADS around a target, resetting this pull effect constantly. This 'feature' should be removed in my opinion. 

###Conclusion

The combination of these additional settings should ensure everyone is able to play as \(s\)he prefers. No more getting your crosshair dragged all over the place in chaotic fights, no more super sticky hunting rifle ADS, no more aim assist ADS abuse and no longer unable to make micro adjustments.

At the same time, traps aren't usually used strategically but instead in an extremely basic fashion where a player will just put one in front of a door, or spam areas with them. Placing a trap doesn't have any negatives whatsoever, and often players place them immediately after collecting them since they have no real value unless you hoard and spam them.

I think traps could be utilized much better if they were treated like the normal four buildables in the sense that you spawn with them and they cost resources to place. Although I think a restriction should be placed on them somehow, perhaps make their build cost high, or only allow a certain amount to be placed at the same time. I think they should also deal damage to whoever placed them (but not their team) to promote strategic play and condone ""cheesing"".

I don't know, this is just my thoughts. At the moment I think traps are severely underutilized and literally the only times I've ever died to them is when players spam them.",FortNiteBR

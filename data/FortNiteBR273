Shotguns are too weak,"I don't understand what the issue with double shotguns was, it was broken, and it required timing. Now, the SMG's win in all mid-short range fights because they MELT. A bad player can spray with an SMG and kill a good player with a shotgun because he has to WAIT to kill the opponent. Epic, your ruining the game and making it so every update, skill is nerfed. Im actually fed up of this. Stop breaking the game, or just make a competitive playlist with balanced guns in it...

So last season I used to look a lot at this spreadsheet : [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8j2m92/fortnite\_season\_4\_xp\_chart/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8j2m92/fortnite_season_4_xp_chart/)

I found it kinda useful so I was wondering if anyone gonna make this spreadsheet for Season 5. And since I havent seen it on this reddit yet I decided to make it myself. It basically tells you how much &amp;#37; of EXP you are on each level to unlocking full Ragnarok skin. Also you can see on which level you unlucky each part of Drift and Ragnarok skins. I hope someone finds this as useful as I do :) 

(I made only the yellow spreadsheet the rest is copied from the guy that made it last season)

(Also im asuming that the EXP needed for each level will stay the same as last season but so far it looks like it)

And on top of that, the only new location on the map that actually seems organic and not forced on us is Lazy Links. The map looks straight ugly now from the sky. The viking village looks completely out of place and unnatural. The desert is by far the best example of forced location I can think of. Looks like bologna.

The original point was for the grinders to feel rewarded for something they worked their ass off for and basically got no reward because people bought it early and took away the value of the skin (Season 3 John Wick).  So as a reward for grinding out levels the people who played more Fortnite and got to Level 80 were rewarded with changeable lights on the Omega, which was perfect because the people who got to level 80 actually had some sense of accomplishment for working towards something hard with a short deadline, and the people who had a wife and kids and a job that they can pay for all the tiers right away but can’t play a lot couldn’t get it. which is perfect for the people who spend $10 every season and can’t buy anything else but work their ass off and level up a lot. I got to a level higher then 25 but less then 30 for S1, but nobody really got a high level, then i got to 50 something S2 but had the battle pass for none of it so there was no extra daily challenges that i could get an extra 500 XP every day from.  S3 i reached level 100 and in my opinion this was the easiest season for leveling up. S4 was harder but i still got to 93 and was rewarded with just 3 colors on a skin i think was ugly anyways. Now S5 i’m already at a little higher then 40K XP, like tier 17 i think and when I get  Ragnarok i’m gonna grind my ass off for that 500K so i can have all the upgrades because this is my favorite skin of all time but it’s not even special because this is a skin i earned and now legit if u reach tier 100 and play fortnite u will get all the upgrades eventually.  I’m not mad because “tHe sKiN WoNt bE aS rArE aNYmoRe”, im mad because the upgradable sets in the battle pass is where i can show how hard i worked for this game. Nobody sees my battle bus logo thing or my mako glider and sees i’ve been playing since S1.  nobody sees a black knight skin i don’t have and sees i’ve been playing since S2 people see the john wick and everyone got john wick so i didn’t work towards anything. i wore the omega like 3 times so there’s nothing i get out of that because i don’t even like the skin. but now if people see me wearing the full Ragnarok they will see i worked hard for it, until everyone can get it mid Season 6 and i feel like i wasted my time again",FortNiteBR

Sure double shotgunning doesnt take a lot of skill to learn, but hitting high damage shotgun shots in rapid session faster than your opponent does. And since when did any SMGs take skill to use. They are litterally just hovering your crosshair in your opponents chest/head area and holding down mouse1. People are bringing up how the game is more variated now, which i really do not get, considering almost every player is using the shotgun smg combo.

Double pump before last patch was'nt even the best option imo. As a rank 5000 with 5 KD season 4 my go to loadout was AR, TAC, C4 and double healing. Only if i could not find C4 i used double shotguns. ",FortNiteBR

Season 2 had the Knights. Season 3 had the space theme which, on it's own, they didn't do much with. But at the tail end of Season 3, they introduced the comet. 

Oh boy that comet. The comet was both consistent with the S3 theme and started the whole narative for Season 4. This impending impact was looming over everyone. Once it finally hit, it changed the map. Buildings were destroyed, an area of the map was changed, the jump rocks were introduced and everything was dandy. We had this massive government facility at the site of the main impact doing spooky government stuff

And then we saw the weekly changes of buildings being restored and fixed up - the holes being filled and the jump rocks being taken out of the smaller craters. People speculated about how the rocks / trucks seemed to be making their way to the super villain lair 

The super villain? Damn that well executed plot twist of the entire super hero story line being just a movie? Then the Visitor jumps out of the rock and breaks out of the government facility in Divot? How he modifies the movie prop to turn it into that real rocket? The rocket launch seemed to have caused irreperable damage to the fabric of space - why? No one knows. 

Then we have S5 that finally launched. New areas from alternate dimensions seem to be popping into the world of Fortnite seemingly at random. There isn't any real rhyme or reason to it yet. First loading screen that is part of the ""Road Trip"" challenge set? It's just Drift, a guy from our universe who got sucked into Fortnite hanging out with a bunch of the cooky looking skins. 

It is a little early to obviously say for certain where this season will go - but when we had all the speculations being about time travel, or aliens, the leviathan game mode, a second map... And all we end up with is a handful of new POI's and some weird glowing Viking... It just seems a little too random. 

Maybe I'm wrong and maybe they'll have some master tier narative that will slam into us, but everything about this season so far doesn't seem as gripping as Season 4 was. There doesn't seem to be as much potential as there was last time around.",FortNiteBR

Tactical shotgun - Best shotgun for me right now because it has a decent fire rate and due to consistrnt shotguns and registered bullets will be seen so aim is the only problem right now but if you do miss you got that lickity split smg in your next slot.


Heavy shotgun - Good damage and decent fire rate but I still need that good aim so probably deciding on the tactical or the heavy with raritys but can be a goof second option.",FortNiteBR

I dont know if its just me, but the longer i played this game the more motivation i need (e.g. through battlepass skins). But in this season is no skin that motivates me playing. The topic had so much potential, they could have added antique roman skins, cowboys, pirates or even knights again...
But this...

Also the map changes are not that good.
Yes, the whole desert area is really interesting at all, but they only added two new locations to the old biome. I saw many suggestions on reddit that were so promising like making tilted towers medievel.

My friends and i were playing yesterday and we had no fun. We did the weekly challanges (except the llama challange (what a great start in this season btw)) and quitted shortly after finishing the missions.

If they keep the skill gap too high Fortnite will just become like fighting games, games that have a famously high barrier for entry in terms of skill. You can't just pick up a fighting game and go online and start winning, you'll get creamed by people who put the time in to practice. As a result people tend to steer clear of fighting games because they don't want to 'work' at a game, they just want to play.

If Fortnite becomes a game where unless you sit down watch hundreds of hours of youtube videos to learn how to do all the advanced techniques it'll cripple the growth of the game as people will be turned off by the steep barrier to entry. This is why Epic keep lowering the skill gap by nerfing advanced techniqes like edit peeking and stuff.

And if you think I'm making the barrier to entry and lack of players thing a much bigger deal than it really is, listen to this.

Fortnite has been around for about a year, the Fortnite Batte Royale subreddit is closing in on 800,000 subscribers. The subreddit for Mortal Kombat, one of the longest running (26 years!) and most famous gaming franchises in history only just passed 30,000 subscribers.

Let me start with the battle pass. I know this is mostly subjective but I'm not a fan of costumed superheros, I like superpowers but seeing someone who can throw rocks in red leggins has always made me cringe. I liked the S2 Season Pass just because Black Knight was cool but S3 was also kinda lame to me. 

This season pass though has some decent looking 'inbetween'-skins and two super cool skins sets to acomplish. The level one skin looks sick once you hit 100k exp and even more sick when you're at 200k and fully upgraded Ragnarök will definitely be my favorite skin - so fucking badass.
I also like it that the grind to 200k and 500k exp is now not painful but rather a goal. It's not like you check the remaining S5 days every day now because you just have a goal and you can acomplish it now, in 90 days or even 2019.

The map changes are brutal. Viking Village is super cool designed and close to several POI's which makes up for the mediocre chest spawns. Lazy Links was another reddit suggestion that made it into the game (gotta love Epic) and is perfectly setup. Many chest spawns, cool scenario, ATK's - way better than Anarchy. Desert biome could not be better in the slightest. The mountains, the design, the grafic, the oasis, the spot on the map, the POI's - everything in the desert biome fits perfectly into the game and the unnamed city at the bottom is now my favorite drop spot in the game. 

Which leads me to the next point. Rifts. RIFTS. For me those are one of the top 5 things that have been added to the game. Never has Fortnite been so dynamic and mobile. Before I avoided POI's like Lucky Landing, Flush etc. because I like action and I hate simple running to the circle. But with Rifts you can now land anywhere on the map and still have the action you have when landing Retail, Salty etc. I really deeply hope they stay even after S5, sadly I doubt it since hop rocks are gone now but I would love it so much if rifts could stay.

ATK's. I was scared when I saw them in the patchnotes, because everyone who played Car1Z1 knows what vehicles can do to a game. But ATK's are perfectly implemented. I don't care if my enemy has one but I love it if I have one myself, just how it should be.

Double shotgun is finally fixed which is a great thing too. I read many posts about this limiting a possible viable playstyles but I hardly disagree. You can pump, tac or heavy shotgun, you have combine each of it with an smg, a thommy gun or a lmg, you just can't exploit anymore to skip the weaknesses of single shotguns. But this is a good thing. Pump+tac was not worse than pump+smg for good players and you gotta balance the game around good players. A combo that can deal 155 dmg or in case of double pump 170 damage (without headshots) within .8 seconds is not a balanced playstyle.

I'm so glad for season 5 and I don't know when was the last time that I was so hyped about exploring the game, achieving the challenges and fullfilling the battle pass. 
The gameplay is close to perfect right now (slight nerf to explosives would be appreciated) and I can't wait to get home and grind the weekend.

**tldr;**
Season 5 is the best season so far and the map changes, ATK's, rifts and double shotgun fixes are perfect for the game. The battle pass skins are one of the best so far (subjective to me) and I can't wait to fully unlock Ragnarök.

Auto-fire was added on this update and it is RUINING the game!","Like the title says, auto-fire was added on mobile and it is labeled as the ""recommended"" setup. Initially I thought it would be okay, I've played other mobile games with it and it worked. But after ten seconds on the spawn island, I realized it wasn't going to help so I disabled it. Problem solved right? Wrong. 

Less skilled players that don't know a lot are keeping it on. Now, imagine turning a corner with a shotgun and your crosshairs dragging across someone. It will take you a little to see them and then respond right? Well, auto-fire gets rid of that reaction time. You can literally have your gun start shooting before you realize you are aiming at an enemy. Fun right? Wrong. Most of the time the players using auto-fire don't even win because they don't build or just stand there. BUT, they do manage to do some damage to you that they wouldn't have done without it. Then you are stuck healing up when a more skilled player sneaks up after hearing the gunfire and finishes you. 

This is not about preying on the weak. With no extra XP after the first kill there is no need to stack kills on mobile (plus our stats aren't monitored). This is about enjoying the game like we did. No one asked for auto-fire. Most at r/Fortnite_Mobile agree with this and have made posts but if you guys can help it get traction here, Epic can see it. Thanks! ",FortNiteBR

Essentially, it would be a mode of the game as it was at launch (with the exception of skins). This INCLUDES the original stats and features of guns. For example, the new feature where the pellets for shotguns are displayed would NOT be displayed. The game would play EXACTLY as it did at launch, including the original map and weapons that have put in the vault. It would be as close as possible to the original game. 

I think this would be cool just to see how far this game has come. Fortnite has had so many drastic changes that it would be really cool to reflect on its past. After all, everyone and everything has to start somewhere, and often times, something’s beginnings largely influences its current state. 

One idea I was toying around with to be in conjunction with Classic Royale is the rerelease of old skins in the item shop to pay homage to them. I know that this happened with the Red Knight, and got a lot of hate, but I think doing this would really make the LTM feel special.

The last one does not necessarily need an AR or a CQC backup for the pump as the Drum fills both purposes to an extent.

Below average players just holding down the triggers and setting spike traps down once you breach their shell is becoming too common. It’s gotten to the point where I won’t even jump in and they’ll still just set the spike trap down because they think I’m going to. 

Regardless, the more time spent on one pencil warrior that can build spam but not aim just means that someone else or some other team is going to hear the noise and pull up. It’s just back to back fighting and everyone turtles up once they realize they take too much damage or their teammate goes down or whatever. 

Mats should be capped lower than 999. I don’t know by how much, but something needs to be done and spike traps definitely should not be a free 150 damage for anyone. I’m not sure why they buffed them so much but it probably had something to do with everyone complaining about how weak they were. 100 damage is fair. 

I know I’m not the only one having this problem. Back to back build fights or turtling against people that really aren’t very good players is exhausting when the end of every fight is just killing them out of the box they put themselves in.

The game has literally done everything in its power as of late **to help players not get caught in the storm**. Bounce pads sideways, carts down mountains, golf carts, etc. But, when you're in a 1v1 at the end of the game, the storm literally decides who is going to win by the placement of the ""storm outside the storm"". I am watching videos of people physically trying to get out of the storm but they are getting pinned against a mountain, pinned against multiple walls, stuck under trees, pillars and so on (as the storm literally kills you in a matter of seconds). 9 times out of 10, the final 2 players have c4, rockets or grenade launchers which prevents ANY building from lasting longer than 0.2 seconds. 

The end game 1v1 has come down to absolute luck it seems even though they have literally created everything to avoid the storm. 

1v1 is supposed to be **ONE VS ONE PLAYER PVP,** not 2 players standing around running from the storm in a game that is catering to NOT getting caught in the storm for the first 15 minutes.

Believe or not, I've spent a lot of time to acquire to necessary skill to compete against good players. But, what can I do? You do not want it in the game so it must be gone. For the second time.

Pepe the frog continued in the game, exploring that beautiful desert map, getting killed trying to golf-taxi my fellow enemies and thought nothing could be worse than losing my double mates. Holy Molly, sweet Jesus, then I picked the tactical one. The only thing I was glad for was that my keyboard is waterproof. Why? Because I cried a lot. Let me explain why. I fought a guy and chased him with a white tactical shotgun, shot him point-blank 4 times for 21, 7, 11, 24, even though I had a lot of cranberries in my crosshair. It was just an accident I thought. Then it happened again, and again. You've totally destroyed the tactical shotgun, your Battle Pass challenge is done, congratulations. Meanwhile, try to use the heavy shotgun. You will wipe your enemies out as easily as the aliens did with mankind in War of the Worlds movie. Just, please, do something with this unbalanced shotgun situation.

# Submachine guns

Oh, you tricky foxes, you've nerfed the MPs. Victory! We balanced it. Wrong. Even now people are getting lasered by that weapon, no matter the color, who cares if the damage is nerfed. Many will still prefer it over a scar and that's a problem, that really is. And even when you don't have the Suppressed Gun, you don't need to worry, because there still is the submachine terror. So, you will laser your enemies nonetheless. Now, try this combo - Suppressed Gun/ submachine gun, Heavy shotgun, and that beautiful hunting rifle. With this combo, I'm telling you, you will cause your opponents such a shock that they will need to defibrillate themselves in real life.

# Pistol/revolver spawn

Another thing I've noticed is the massive amount of revolver and pistol spawn. Maybe it was just my luck, but I've never picked so many pistols/revolvers in one round, and definitely not 3-5 in one house.

# Map

How about the map? I must admit that I like the desert part very much. It is a change, wants me to keep playing the game, I do enjoy it, it is something new to explore. But, there are some places that need some treatment/adjustment. You wanted nature in Dusty, I don't have any problem with that, but the trees do. It's really hard to have a building fight over there when the trees simply block you. I had a lot of problem with final circles in Wailing Woods and I don't want to have them in Dusty as well. I'd love you to just do something with Wailing Woods, so we can have only one place with high tree concentration. Or make the trees go through. You did it with our platforms, even for enemies, I don't see why this should be a problem. Then you should probably take a look at the Junk Junction - Haunted Hills area. People simply do not want to land there and I do not blame them. That area needs something new.

# C4

C4. Just look at them, please, will you? Make a package of 3 instead of 4, and decrease the damage so you're not walking nuclear bomb.

# Red Knight skin

Another thing that kinda broke my heart was putting the Red Knight skin into the shop again. There used to be a time that you'd have tightened your ass when you saw this skin. Today? I've met two of them and I'm not completely sure that they knew they were playing Fortnite, do you know what I mean? Confusedly ran back and forth with their pencils out. You've messed this skin up big time. If some skin is old enough that it is eventually gained its uniqueness you should not bring it back into the shop. Not even if it seems so lucrative, or whatever your reason was. That is rewarding itself for the players that bought that item and had the patience to continue playing it this long.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Believe me, I have nothing but love for Fortnite, but this love is vanishing with every update you, guys, are putting out. Stop making the game so beginner-friendly (materials for example). They will uninstall your game in a few week/months anyway and jump into another game that is popular. Start listening to players that do spend a massive amount of time in your game.

Thank you for your time, have a good day, and enjoy Season 5.

You could run double pump, pump / tac shotgun, pump / smg, tac shotgun / smg, or even double smg if you wished. And the best thing about it? **Any of these are arguably just as strong as the other.** I personally used double pump. Now before you go into the comments about me being salty that a load out that I used is now ineffective after being dominant for many seasons. I'll admit it. Yes I am salty. But I truly believe that double pump was not in any way overpowered before the season 5 nerf. Here me out. 

After the mid-season 4 patch, in which shotgun damage was heavily nerfed, shotguns were in a good spot, but still were far better than the smg, so people demanded that shotguns be nerfed again. But instead Epic took a different route and buffed the suppressed and tactical smg, making them up-to-par, if not better than shotguns. Professional players and content creators alike started using a variety of different combinations for close quarter fighting, with even the minigun making a few appearances. In my opinion, this was the best place the Fortnite meta had ever been in. It wasn't perfect, but it didn't restrict players into using the ""AR / Pump / Pump / Splode or Sniper / Meds"" loadout that was the norm for so long. 

And then Season 5 comes in with all the new shotgun changes, and right when there was some refreshing variety in the meta, Epic decides to change it and restrict players yet again. Double pump is now impossible, pump / tactical shotgun is now pointless, and, to put it simply, the pump shotgun is well and truly out of the meta. Instead you are pretty much restricted to use tactical shotgun / smg. 

&gt;*But double pump was wayyy to overpowered because it could do the damage of a pump at the speed of a tac shotgun.*

First of, no, it was not as fast as the tactical shotgun. And secondly in the mid-season 4 shotgun nerf Epic drastically nerfed shotgun damage to built structures. Sooo you could either take the faster firing but lower damage tactical shotgun paired with an smg that melts through structures like butter. Or take two high damage pumps that take 5 shots to knock down a wooden wall.

&gt;*Then just carry an smg as well as the shotguns.*

Could work, but 3 slots of 5 slots dedicated to close range fights? When you could use that slot for a splode weapon, a sniper, meds, or an AR?

**TL;DR** The pre-season 5 meta was in a great place and Epic should revert the changes made to delay in shotgun switching time.",FortNiteBR

It has become a pure sweat-fest with it now becoming harder and harder to hop into a game and enjoy the experience. It is hard for new players to start playing Fortnite because they have to face these sweats almost every game. A lot of my friends have either dropped the game altogether or just plain given up at trying to even win anymore. As much as I consistently played and loved this game since day one, I'm starting to lose hope that Fortnite will last any longer.

**WEAPONS**

The new SMG meta is terrible and it's hard to not get lasered from far distances. There hasn't been a single game where I haven't seen a sweaty tryhard pull up on me and just melt me in about 3 seconds. It just keeps happening over and over again and it's making me lose my mind. The repetition and lack of variety in players right now sucks. Epic has also completely removed every form of double shotgun again, which is just stupid because it was a good combo that wasn't game breaking. Bloom is also still a very big issue and it is still broken. I will literally have my crosshairs completely over someone, and I will then proceed to do nothing to them.

**BUGS**

I can't even verbally explain how many game breaking bugs are in this game, so here are a few of the major ones. First of all, the good ol' phasing through walls. The amount of games I have lost because of this is ridiculous. The fact that it has been in the game for this long is absolutely unacceptable and it's sad how people abuse it. When I create a physical object, it should NEVER allow players to walk straight through. Another bug is how you can phase through the ground with a shopping cart and be able to shoot people through the ground (I don't know if they fixed it, so I could be wrong) and now the ATK's bugs where you get thrown under the map. There are so many more but those are just a couple.

**PLAYERS/MATCHMAKING**

IMO, one of the biggest problems in the game. To put it simply, there are to many tryhards in the game. Last season, I got an Xbox and when I played my first ever game on that account, I encountered one of the sweatiest players every in the first 5 minutes. Then the next game there was another one and another one and so forth. What I'm trying to say is that Fortnite needs to be more skill based, not a mix of everything. Yeah, with the current matchmaking, you may have half of the lobby or more your skill but then the rest is just messed up and way better than the rest. It should just be 95&amp;#37; or the whole lobby your skill level to make it fair, so casual or lower skill players don't always have to encounter these people.

Overall, I honestly miss old Fortnite because back then you could actually have fun and just play the game every match. Today, it is impossible to be casual anymore and it's not fair to chill or new players with the way things are. The days of Fortnite are quickly coming to an end because of new games but mostly these problems.",FortNiteBR

Yes, it might be considered an advantage to some extent, having a extra spot for splodes and healing and such, but you also don’t have the option to farm for yourself any more, giving yourself a disadvantage.  You would either have to rely on your kills to replenish materials, or split mats with your teammates which doesn’t increase the total amount of materials for the team, and would cause the team to have to spend more time harvesting instead of rotating.

Please tell me your theories.,"[THIS POST IS JUST ASKING QUESTIONS AND STATING THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM. I HAVE NO ANSWERS AS OF NOW]

Ok let’s start off with the first question. We knew a couple days ago that the rifts had something do with the content update coming out on the season 5 launch. When season 5 did launch, the giant rift in the sky opened up, and things started falling through the rift into the game, hence the new desert and locations. Though if the rift has already fulfilled it’s purpose, why is it still in the sky and opening more rifts on the ground. What huge event has to occur to seal the rift? Does it have to do with the bunker in Wailing Woods? Or maybe the anomalies we’re going to talk about next. My second question was what were the anomalies? (A short backstory: When the Durr Burger disappeared, it appeared in the California desert in the form of a statue, and the “agents” that worked there said they were researching anomalies in the Durr Burger site.) So, you can say that the anomalies were that the things in Fortnite were appearing in real life, things like loot llamas, items, etc. But these researchers were searching something else as in a desk at the Durr Burger site, you can see many books, most of them about aliens and U.F.O.’s. Does this mean that the rift was created by aliens, which then finally leads me to my last question. Who detonated the rocket that created the rift? People assume it was the traveler, and can’t you even think of the traveler as an alien. I mean he looks mysterious, made with technology from ahead of our time. Could the traveler be the one who detonated the rocket after all? Please speculate, any theories you guys can think of would be awesome.


Side questions to ponder on:

1. The slogan for season 5 was worlds collide, and they did as stuff from the real world appeared in Fortnite, does that mean we’ll see more stuff from Fortnite come out in the real world?

2. If the small rifts on the ground are so powerful to take you to the sky, can the enormous rift in the sky take you to other planets?

3. The rift in the sky seems to be still growing, will this rift soon crack or even explode?

4. Could the bunker in Wailing Woods be the home of the traveler due to it’s secretive location?

I feel like season 5 is going to kill fortnite because you are making the same mistakes that every BR developer yet has made. You try to add in too many things. Fortnite at the very end of season 3 was the best map/game play in fortnite. The shopping cart was a funny good edition. The jetpack was bad and thankfully you guys removed it, which I applaud you for listening. But me and all my friends agree on a bunch of problems. 
1. We don't need new guns anymore. 
2. We understand diversifying the inventories of players however you made some bad changes in our opinions this is what needs to happens.
-The shotgun changes from the most recent patch need to be reverted however you should leave the consistency unchanged.
-The  SMGs are perfect right now and should stay the same as well as snipers.
-Explosives NEED a nerf, the nades/rockets need to be reverted to the way they where before the latest patch, because they currently do way too much structural damage as building is the skill gap.
-THE C4 NEEDS TO BE NERFED. The C4 is completely ridiculous. It does way too much damage to players and too much damage to structures it is just way too powerful. Building is the skill gap in the game, why make it easier for players who don't know/want to learn to build to knock good players out of their builds and kill them.
3. The Golf Cart is not necessary, is it funny? Yes. But it has no place in the game shopping carts where perfect. The movement in this game is fast enough so even if the circle is as far away as possible players can still make it there in the allotted time. The shopping cart is goofy and speeds it up, the golf cart however is just pointless. I can't justify completely hating it but I just think it has no place in the game. 
4. I love the changing seasonal maps, its cool, but I think there should be a second map option (preferrably the map at the very end of season 3) for us players who don't want to have the map completely changed. In the optional map they should have all the guns and the shopping cart, nothing else, and challenges should not be able to be played on this map, on the changing seasonal map the challenges should be played, and they can add all the fun gimmicky stuff like golf carts and golf courses. 
Yes I understand im complaining a lot, but this is what I feel needs to happen or fortnite could kill itself.

EPIC had announced many times that server updates would occur at 4:00am EST, giving me just enough time that night to finish getting level 80. However, with less than 1500exp away from level 80, EPIC shutdown servers early. About 30-35 minutes early, which would've given me plenty of time to get that last 1450 exp I needed to receive level 80.

Normally I would not be upset about not reaching my desired level, but I feel somewhat cheated. I was told in bold banners that servers would start going down at 4:00am, but they went down early causing me to not get content I paid for.

Anyone else just barely miss level 80 due to early server shutdowns? Anything EPIC can due to remedy this?

And I might use some bad words.. whoops

Anyways, let’s get started. 

Fuck this game! Why do shotguns do insanely low damage? Why is the mid range accuracy on pistols bad? Why does the hand canon heal opponents at long distance? Why is the building system crappy? Why did you not bring back factories?(probably the reason I’m writing this) And more importantly, WHY IS THE GAME CHANGING TO MEET THE SKILLS OF THE NOOBS?????? You are making it easier to play. You are helping out those that lacked the skills necessary to be good at the game. 

I started in season 3 and let me tell you, THAT SYSTEM WAS PERFECT! I was soo bad, I couldn’t build, I couldn’t double pump, I couldn’t react quickly, i couldn’t take advantage of the knowledge I have today because I wasn’t PRACTICING ENOUGH. Then I started playing a lot . A lot quickly became hundreds of games. That practice allowed me to reach a 
point where I was “good” at the game. I dedicated that time and was proud at what I was accomplishing. Then season 4 came out..

Season 4 forced me to completely change my play style(double pump was becoming popular, fast harvesting, new items, etc). All these changes require skill!! But it was okay because what’s a game without changes right? Same old crap gets boring, right?? But Why change the physics of the game? Yeah some people were getting one pumped, some people were getting lasered with an AR and maybe some people couldn’t just build(lol). But why couldn’t you just slightly adjust the math rather than create a new system?? How about them traps?? It’s like you guys were purposely fucking with us. Traps are too op at 125 damage? Lower it to 75! Traps are now too weak? Increase it to 150! Yay problem solved. Wtf????? It’s like some dick in development hates the number 100(You’re not really a dick I’m just grumpy). What about fucking C4s? Whoops I mean mini nukes. These spawns of satin now can blow up half the map. It’s like they just copied the TNT from Minecraft.   But the game was still fun!(except that month with jet packs) shopping carts were a great add! So were bounce pads, dual pistols, famas and vending machines But cmon a fucking guided missile(man did I take advantage of that). Okay season overall.

Yay new season, new me. Season 5 started out great! Shotguns are afraid of doing damage. Tactical SMGs are cancer. ARs are even less accurate. Did you just open a chest with a grey SMG?? Dude that’s like the new golden scar. Man you just landed 6 shots with a hand canon at like 60+ meters? Don’t worry I’ll take care of the other 194 dmg. Wait theirs a little spinny thingie when ever I try to switch to my tact after shooting my pump?? That guy has a heavy shot gun, just run man.  This game has become super doo doo.

I’m probably going to keep playing though.

Season 4, what did we get? New map areas that are now a “meh” landing place, new events and skins. And what does season 5 have? Karts and toys and same stuff as season 4.

There’s literally a lot of time for the season 5 for me to judge but the game for me didn’t make a drastic change since last season, except for a few patches and nerfs.

It was fun for me, I liked the sound, I liked the way my character acted and I enjoyed juggling moving around with swapping weapons.

Now that it's gone I'm fine, pump + smg was better anyways for many reasons. But the way these nerfs were implement were so lazy frankly i'm insulted game designers at Epic thought this was a good balance solution.

Adding a cool-down to a specific weapon in a 3rd person shooter is about the least creative way I could possible imagine they could have come up with. To prove this I believe I have to infinitely more interesting balance changes that could be made, to both keep double pumping as a strategy, while making it's effectiveness more balanced in the eyes of most players:

1. Reduce the damage further(to say, 100 damage max) and reduce the delay between switching to a pump. What this does is make the juggle action of swapping quickly more skillful by forcing it to happen more often. This gives players more time to react, but keeps the spirit of the strategy in tact.

2. Increase the damage of the pump significantly, but reduce it's ammo count to 1 and improve it's reload time. What this does is keep the spirit of the pump as a valid initiation weapon, and perhaps brings back a single double pump combo, but ultimately discourages running two pumps in favor of having one simply for a swift initial burst of damage. This delay is more organic than the cool down currently in place because it's not just some circle your character bows down to, but a reload. Secondly this adds more risk to double pumping, with the added reward of higher damage, but makes it poor in situations against multiple enemies. Forcing smarter use of the tactic. 

I think both of these methods would have kept the spirit of the pump, and the spirit of double pumping in tact, while also heavily reducing it's ubiquity as a all around great combo. 

Increase risk, or increase skill. Don't add cool downs to a shooter.

As a final note I suggest removing the pump all together, and creating a new shotgun to take it's place. I would suggest a double barrel shotgun that does between 50-70 per shot, but can be fired in quick succession with a moderate pull out delay. This forces a but more tracking, allows players to build in between the the two shots and asks for more accuracy on the part of the user. Furthermore adding additional risk due to the necessity to reload (which could be significant as double barrels are).

Tl;dr - Couldn't think of a better balance change than a cool down for using a shotgun? Come on... ",FortNiteBR

Then, go to a spot with the rifts. Take it and the moment you can, open up your glider. Go out in a direction and come back and use the other rifts, OR go from rift spot to rift spot (idk if it's possible tho directly)

Season 4: season 4 was cool in that we got selectable styles for outfits, and the hype around the meteor was awesome, however I felt that throughout the season it was just pretty bland and the battle pass outfits were a letdown imo.

4. Season 3: the skins were pretty cool and I loved the memes that came with this season. Rust lord, John wick, who could forget them? Although I still don’t think 3 tops seasons 1, 2, or 5.

3. Season 2: this was the first battle pass and in my opinion this battle pass has the coolest skins. The black knight was so much fun to grind for too.

2. I’m putting season 1 here simply because of how it’s “the good old days” just the season shop, bush campers, and the people who were gods because they could build a 1x1.  While this season didn’t have a battle pass, it has very rare skins like skull trooper, renegade raider, and recon expert.

1. Season 5: well done epic. The fresh new map, the vehicles, the interactive rifts and the awesome skins and emotes. This is by far the best season yet. Great job epic. You nailed it.

maybe some of you already seen that other users says that Llamas can be found on the lake that is crossing the ientire map, well, i can confirm (on my personal experience at least) that this is actually TRUE!!

1st attempt: i hopped with 3 guys on a golf cart, and then found 1 lonely llama near Loot Lake, i didn't managed to open the Llama on time, so that didn't count for me :'(

2nd attempt, i was rushing this callange, gettin' in many matches and looking around the lake, if i didn't find a llama, i quitted and get in the next match, but then, when i was skydiving, i find my precious Llama near a mountain, luky me, i got near to a big tree, so i estroyed it, build a ladder and finally opened the Llama, Challenge and Week 1 Completed!

maybe i managed to did the whole week on the very first day, but seriously Epic, don't do this kind of challenges again, it's simply not fair to do challenges that require more luck than skill, and if you're doing it anyways, at least don't do it this hard, the least you could do is increase the amount of llamas per match, instead of 3, do 6, or 10, 100 lamas around the entire map doesn't seems that bad to me, they barely give good stuff, so i don't see the problem on puttin' more of them :(",FortNiteBR

So I think it would be cool for just one season there was a new game mode that didnt allow you to build. We could see if anybody likes it or not. 

I absolutely love the gunplay in this game but most often it gets cut off by somebody building a wall. After that it either turns into a snipe battle with 2 people peeking heads, or you get close and its a shotgun battle. Those 2 things consist of 90% of the gun battles I've experienced. I'd like being in good spots to be more important. I want people to use the environment as cover not build their own. If I get the drop on someone in the open I want to have the advantage. Or vice versa.

If nobody likes it, fine don't keep it. But I feel like you would be able to do a lot more without cover. You'd see more clutch plays and more 1v4 squad wiping. That's what I personally feel that this game needs for a specific audience like myself.",FortNiteBR

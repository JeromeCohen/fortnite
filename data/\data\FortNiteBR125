He also seems very irritable and takes a lot more frequent breaks. Also, I see him doing squads more often and staying quiet as if he's lost his streaming enthusiasm and personality.

Why is this and when did it start?

I do not have some high tech pc, my pc is utter garbage! I bought the skin even though it had the black dress with blotches look on it thinking it was a bug, (I actually like the skin, fight me (noticed people don't like it)) anyways, I played a few games with it and the next day and then my friend tells me on reddit they say you have to have effects on medium.... EXCUSE ME WHAT? I play on sh\*t resolution, not my actual screen resolution, and my 3D resolution is less than 70% and all my setting is on low and I barely get 60fps.... DO YOU REALLY THINK I CAN RUN EFFECTS ON MEDIUM? If you need help with the answer... N to the effin O -\_- 

&amp;#x200B;

So I email EPIC and at first, I was I'm nice, second-time I'm slightly more annoyed and it's visible a little but I apologize and third time I AM PISSED DUDE. Can't do anything about it. I am sorry but it isn't fair for people like me who can't actually play with the skin when it looks properly, it just seems to me like such a rip off. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT DUDE. Unless they fix the skin and let it be seen as it is in low, I think it is ridiculous. So unfair and I am fuming right now.

What do you guys think? Do you think it is fair or am I over-reacting for wasting my money?

It's simple. 

•Clean up the item pool.
This is one of the biggest things I see wrong with this game. There are so many different rarities for so many different weapons, devices, meds, shields, etc. I think that there should be only 3 snipers you can get (blue hunting rifle, purple bolt, gold heavy sniper)  This by itself reduces the item pool by 3. 

ARs need to be heavily changed aswell: vault regular 3 burst, remove blue AK (I for one think the AK is a really strong weapon and shouldn't pack that type of punch as a blue rarity AR.) The famas, as far I can tell doesnt need to be touched. Sure, no one really uses it, but this post is already too much to ask from epic.

Shotguns. Why doesnt the pump have a grey rarity like the tac? Good question. I say either remove the grey tac or add a grey pump. I cant tell you how many times I've landed on a grey tac and gotten smacked by someone with a pump, ""jUsT hIt YoUr ShOtS"" Nah. You can't really win a tac vs. pump duel unless you outplay. As far as the heavy pump and heavy shotgun, I'd say they are pretty fine the way they are. I like the heavy shotgun for long accurate shots, and the heavy pump is great for one pumps.

Devices such as the turret really need to removed. The item is very very useless now due to the fact that you can get sniped from any angle after the nerf. Boomboxes, (how is this still in the game?) Launch pads NEED to be blue, and bouncers NEED to be readded and made green.

All these changes would make the RNG aspect a little less unbearable.

•Ranked.

This game is over a year old, and there still isn't any sort of skilled matchmaking playlist of any sort. I think there should be a number you get after playing 10 games (calculated by placement and eliminations) Numbers from 0 up to 3000

0-500 Bronze 
501-1000 Silver
1001-1500 Gold
1501-2000 Platinum 
2001-2500 Diamond 
2501-3000 Master 

This would completely revive this game for me, dealing with all these terribly unfortunate RNG based deaths makes me want to quit.

These are 2 solid points I believe and feel free to discuss down below. (I will be replying)

63,CellarSaver,1546534372,ac7jcg,40,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ac7jcg/boomboxes_should_not_be_vaulted/,1,Boomboxes should NOT be vaulted.,"I think the players arguing for a Boombox vault are being a little extreme. Players argue that they ruin the building aspect of the game but I don’t see it like that. 

Boomboxes pause the building aspect and showcase the gun play aspect which is arguable more important. You can build and build all you want, but if you can’t shoot you won’t win. 

Boomboxes do no more damage to the building side of fortnite than port-a-forts. 

I make sure to have a stack of boomboxes every game because people have no idea how to react when they can’t build. Stop trying to spam walls while it’s going off and shoot back! 

If I throw a boom box odds are I’m in the AOE as well and it turns the current battle into a straight up gun fight. 

Stop building more than 3 stories high and you won’t take fall damage from it. 

With that being said I wouldn’t mind if they made some small changes to them. As someone who uses them almost every game I think the current stack limit is too high. Drop it down to 3, and change the duration to 20 seconds. ",FortNiteBR

Spam building should be a thing but it should hurt you.  Right now I can mini gun good players for a full 25 seconds before they have to switch to Brick.

It's kind of embarrassing in a game that's supposed to be tactical.

It has gotten harder and harder to win because the average player has gotten a lot better. There is also so many sweats with soccer skins or other tryhard female skins and it feels like there life depends on them winning every fight. These sweats usually have ttv, youtube or twitch in their name. I dont have the time to play as much  and keep up with these players. And I dont really feel like playing after getting killed over and over by these players. Because of these factors with the average player getting better and sweats I have not gotten a win in over a month. If epic added a ranked mode, most of the sweaty players would play that instead of regular modes. During the pop up cup times the regular solos already feels easier. I at least get some better games during this time even if Im not able to win. If a permanent ranked mode was created then the game would be much more healthy overall. The casual players gets more fun solos and the more competitive/sweaty players gets a more competitive gamemode. ",FortNiteBR

1. Get 2 wins a month(solo)
2. Get 3 wins a month in duo
3. Get 5 wins a month in squads (duos and squads numbers are higher cause I get carried)
4. Improve my building so by the end of the year i can do double ramp ceiling wall
5. Improve my aim tracking so i can actually hit shots
6. Don't get as angry at the game as I used to, after all it is ONLY a game and I need to keep that in mind.
7. Maybe get 15 points in a pop up cup
8. Join a scrim league to get better at scrimming.

I'm tired of this meta along with lots of other people in the community. See here is how the game should be **IN MY OPINION.** I play a lot of solos and it has almost become unplayable. The only time I can somewhat tolerate the game is when I play duos because it's much easier to counter some of the things because you have a partner that can help you out if, for example, you have a plane trying to dive bomb you. 

* Changes to the core gameplay
   * Add 50 health/shield per kill along with 100/50/50 mats.
   * Changes to how bandages and medkits work.
      * Bandages should be able to get you to 100 health.
      * Medkits usage time should be cut to about 7 seconds. Still have the same effect.
      * Having 100 health in the game is nothing, and with very little healing in the first place, this would be a nice add in my opinion.
   * Lower the mat count to 700/500/500.
      * I feel like we need to compromise somewhere so lowering mats would be fine with me.
   * Make the plane unable to fly through builds and remove the turret on it. (Or remove it and add back redeploy. :D)
      * The plane would just bounce off of builds and would only be used for movement around the map.
   * Vault or rework the burst rifle/famas
      * Against an ak or ar it's not nearly as effective.
   * Boomboxes should heal you instead of destroying structures. (Idea)
      * Obviously, the timing needs to be reworked but the idea is that it's super loud but acts like a slurp. Healing you first then adding shield for the remainder of the time.
   * Nerf explosives
      * This has always been a super annoying part of the game. It still needs to be reworked. Maybe lower the rocket count even more.
* Matchmaking
   * Add a ranked playlist along with a casual playlist.
      * Anything that wants to be tested then test it in the casual playlist to keep the game new and exciting for casual players.
      * Ranked should have no dramatic changes that often and should stay the same in order to maintain consistency. Like every other comp. game.
* Add these items back
   * Bouncers
   * Impulses
   * Tommy gun (if not I understand this one.)
* Vault these items:
   * Quad launcher
   * Minigun (or nerf it)
   * Turret
      * I honestly don't mind this one but I don't see it used and it takes up a floor loot spot for me.
   * Boomboxes
* Misc.
   * Press F to take zip lines instead of just hopping on them
      * I've died in a couple of fights I shouldn't have because I accidentally was thrusted onto a zip line. Don't really know why you don't have to interact with it before you take it.
   * Competitive scene
      * Stop with this top 200 players s\*\*\*. Nobody wants to see some random they've never seen before play in a tournament. Instead, have a set group of teams compete in a league sort of thing with the bottom 10 being relegated at the end of a season. Teams like FaZe, Lumonsity, Liquid, TSM, etc. I want to see known players that I like to watch in the tournament, not some random scrub, and this is coming from a random scrub. The problem with the Top 200 is that it is inconsistent and it's hard to keep tracking of so many new players.

- Building caps will be 700,600,500

- Fortnite will devolve in popularity but still reign supreme over other BR games, another building based BR game will be made and will attract some of the hardcore players... but the casual players will still play Fortnite considering its free",FortNiteBR

An epic employee previously stated that there would be a few extra days to finish challenges. Many people planned around this as they assumed it was a reliable source, and some people already finished the glider challenge or wanted something else as compensation.

I haven't seen any of this, but don't hate on the epic employee either. They could have been misinformed or plans had changed. I feel like this situation could have been avoided with clearer communication on the end date of the event and starting the countdown to the end way sooner.

Epic didn't have to give any compensation, but they have tried to establish a good relationship with the community (ex: vaulting infinity blade quickly) and this somewhat undermines that relationship.

I feel this stems from people who completed the challenges wanting their items to stay more exclusive and not caring about others, but can we stop crucifying anyone upset about the situation? What do you guys think about how the whole situation was handled?",FortNiteBR

Believe me, an extra 30 XP goes a long way in the long run.

Epic games. Where do i begin! The event was a complete success with many people enjoying the great items per challenges, but many people begun to slow down in the completion of these challenges after a statement by MrPopoTFS stating in short that ""Players will receive an extra few days after the 14 days to complete all the challenges, estimated to conclude either January 3rd to January 4th."" Many players were happy with the transparency with this statement, allowing players who may go on vacation throughout the conclusion of the year to return early January and finish the challenges in bulk. After returning I checked to begin the challenges and realised that they were gone, confused I expressed myself through the comments of the Fortnite twitter and subreddit. They stated that; "" We apologise for communicating the wrong end date for *14 Days of Fortnite* on social channels. To make up for this, players that completed at least one 14 days event challenge will be granted the Equalizer glider. Eligible players will receive this item in the near future. "" Sorry *W H A T?!* What about the Disco Wrap? What about the Merry Munchkin Pet? You are putting thousands at a disadvantage due to a miscommunication allowing players who were expecting to do all challenges at one receiving a singular glider. That completely unacceptable. Although the mistake is human error, the mistake can also be undone, through the return of the challenges for 24 continuing hours from 12 AM EST. Doing this will allow players to complete every challenges whilst not putting players who wasted their time doing the challenge for the *Equalizer* to not be disadvantaged along with allowing players to still work for the challenge they actually want. If this is too difficult to complete as it would require a map reset, why not allow players to receive a singular item from the event free? Allowing continuation to the story whilst at least allowing players to receive an item they *actually* want. Statement from comments that is highly agreeable:  If a representative of Epic Games states that this event will finish on a certain date then that is what should happen. It's not fair on players who planned to complete the quests to that deadline. It's also not fair rewarding players who put minimal effort in and receive the reward. Miscommunications are understandable but make it right rather than a quick fix. Give players the 2 days to complete any unfinished challenges. The complaints spread to twitter, with Shelby Renae and Ghostninja also discussing the unfairness in this situation, discussing that no matter what, it should have always ended on January 3rd / 4th. 

Complaints to be addressed that has not in the post: (Will be updated based on comments)
*Why not look at the in- game timer??* 
Many people who completed the challenges began to state that there was a timer in the challenge section, but considering that the timer is linked with the same game that uses a ""ending soon"" statement when there is 24 hours left in the battlepass or the season. Perhaps many people thought this, as did I when I saw that there was less than 1 day on the timer as I did not want to waste my 4G and decided to wait. 

TL;DR An employee states that the event will end later than it did. Causes massive backlash. Gives an item only a small majority want instead of giving an extra day as people planned to do the challenges in bulk at this time. SUGGESTIONS: An additional 24hrs beginning at 12AM EST OR; To allow continuation to the story, give players who haven't fully completed all the challenges a singular choice of one of the items in the event allowing players to have at least have one additional item from the event in their inventory.

It seems like no matter where I go/land, there’s always at least 2-3 people salivating at the thought of getting early kills. I can usually hold my own at that point but the second gun shots start ringing, everybody and their mother starts swinging their dick like a helicopter to hurry up and rush you because of the assumption that you’re of low health due to your prior encounters. 

Larry Long Dick over there comes rushing in like he’s Rambo and ends up shooting up the house you were just looting. You start defending yourself and suddenly another person comes rushing your fight, Gaslight Gary starts throwing stinkies at you guys and is rushing you. Suddenly, you just killed two to three people and now Larry Long Dick and Gaslight Gary are coming for your head. You inevitably die because they start ganging up on you then they eventually kill each other and you guessed it, Larry Long Dick survives. As you spectate, you watch Larry go into a corner and pop a shield suddenly, Timid Timmy comes creeping up and one pumps Long Dick Larry for his first kill of the game. Timid Timmy did hardly any work but he stayed back and let everybody kill each other just so he can swoop in and collect his loot. Best thing you know, Building Boner Barry starts building the palace of Versailles to combat Timid Timmy. Timmy is overwhelmed and starts crying, Timmy gets bombarded with rockets from Barry, sorry Timmy. He didn’t have dynamite or a boom box, he never stood a chance. 

I find myself being 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and sometimes 7th partied, regardless of where I go. It’s borderline impossible to defend yourself when everybody is coming for your head once they hear a gunshot. At this point, I feel like you’re better off just playing quiet and passively, not building or giving away your location because odds are, where there’s one person, there’s 42 right behind him thirsty for your schlong. 

Every game is sneaky silencers at this point. ",FortNiteBR

A backpack item that you can ping once every 3 minutes.  

What does a ping do?

A ping takes an aerial photograph of all enemy positions on the map within a certain radius.  Enemy positions are represented as red dots on the large map you can bring up.

The size of the radius is roughly the size of Tilted Towers.  If you were to ping anywhere near the center of Tilted, you would see all players still in the city.

The red enemy positions stay on your map for 5 seconds and then fade away.

Pinging with the backpack makes the player character carry out a 3 second animation where he/she is vulnerable.

Enough with these BS ""safe"" items.  It's time for Epic to open up their imagination.

I strongly disagree, and before you click off this post and downvote me to oblivion hear me out. Planes are a good addition to the BR game mode because it gives people a good way to rotate and move around the map. Some say they are annoying because people just dive-bomb into you and do insane amounts of damage, while this can happen there are plenty of ways to counter this. Here are three pretty simple ones 
1. If you are on the ground try faking the pilot out my building floors one way then turn around and run back the other way
2.zigzag back and fourth in the open and make urself hard to hit then when they get close hop on the plane with them and shotgun them from the wing. 
3. As soon as u hear that sonabitch spray it out the sky or at least try to. When people see that you aren’t afraid to take shots at them/their vehicle without them engaging first they will most likely just fly away because let’s face it anyone who flies around in a plane the whole game isn’t looking for a lot of action (which is fine) 
Also the spray on the plane from the turrets is not at all OP the gun shoots like 20 bullets before it overheats and has horrid accuracy/bloom and only does 30 damage a hit so the chances of you being hit and killed while having a decent amount of HP is extremely unlikely. I’ve seen clips of people who just fly in circles till late game during competitive/skirmish matches, While I can see why this could be an issue it also puts the pilot at a disadvantage because
 1. They aren’t getting any kills so they don’t improve on ammo count/gun rarity/ mat count. 
2. They are a pretty easy target for 3-4 people to focus on and take The plane down within a couple seconds. Dealing 50 white damage to anyone in it plus any shots that hit them while shooting at the plane. 
These are the main reasons why I don’t think planes need to be vaulted. Plus if you think something is “OP” use that shit to your advantage and use it to help you win more or get higher kill games. 

Let’s have a constructive discussion on this and if open to hear other people’s opinions on the issue ",FortNiteBR

This game mode would be a brand new mode with less emphasis on the Battle Royale aspect. The aim of this game would be to protect your storm shield (from Save The World) while trying to destroy other teams'. There would be 6 phases, each lasting 5 minutes, except the last, which would last until the end of the game. The storm shield would have 50,000 health and could be damaged by hitting, shooting, or exploding any part of it.

**The map**

The map would be divided into 4 quadrants, one team of ten players in each quadrant. The storm shield would be placed in random places around the quadrant. There would be multiple maps, but the one I used for an example is a forest map. [Here's a general idea of what it would look like](https://imgur.com/y1YTfTi) (those black bars would not be there, that was just visual). As you can see, your team's storm shield appears green, while the others are red. The white around the edges shows where the world drops off. The map would appear like a floating island.

**Phase 1: Preparation**

This phase would be the beginning of the game. Teams would have five minutes to search for weapons, ammo, materials, etc. and build defenses around their base. The map would look roughly like [this](https://imgur.com/ntueNe9), the purple representing a storm that separates the quadrants.

**Phase 2: Assault 1**

This phase has two parts. Part 1 lasts for 30 seconds, where the storm recedes, opening all quadrants up to other teams. Part two lasts 4:30. Players can either defend their storm shield or attack other teams. 

**Phase 3: Regroup 1**

Like phase 2, this phase would have 2 parts as well- 30 seconds for the storm to return how it was in stage one, and 4:30 for players to heal, rebuild defenses, etc.. Players could be in other quadrants during this time, but could not attack storm shields. When killed they would respawn at their base. 

**Phase 4: Assault 2**

Same as phase 2.

**Phase 5: Regroup 2**

Same as phase 3.

**Phase 6: Sudden Death**

During this phase, the storm would overtake the map, making it appear like [this.](https://imgur.com/6iDChwM) A message saying ""Your storm shield power has failed. Protect it while you can!"". Players would take 0.25 DPS, so they could stay alive long enough to finish the game, but still have to heal and watch their health. The storm shield would take 10 DPS. Respawning would be disabled. This phase would last until A. All storm shields but one have been destroyed or B. All players die except for one team. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now that I've explained the game, let's talk about kits. Each player would get the default kit and could unlock others through quests. Each kit would come with different weapons and items. They could **only** be swapped for weapons of the same type- for example, the default kit could swap the AR for a burst AR, heavy AR, etc. or a rifle of a higher rarity, the tactical shotgun could be swapped with any other shotgun. There are some exceptions to this; if that is the case, it will be stated. Each kit also comes with 100 ammo for any gun they have. The 5th slot could be filled with any consumable, but *not* another weapon.

**The Default Kit**

The default kit would spawn with a gray assault rifle, a gray tactical shotgun, a gray SMG, and 5 bandages.  Their loadout would look like [this.](https://imgur.com/zVK6fm1)

**The Medic**

The medic would be unlocked by healing 500 health. This could be done by using medkits, slurp juice, bandages, etc. Shield would not count for this. They would be equipped with the same loadout as the default, but with 3 medkits instead of 5 bandages, like [this.](https://imgur.com/ySQpucE) On top of that, they would receive 1 medkit every 5 minutes. If their inventory is full, it would drop on the ground. 

**The Grenadier**

The grenadier would be unlocked by dealing 1000 damage to enemy players or building with grenades. They would have the same loadout as the default, but with 10 grenades instead of 5 bandages, like [this.](https://imgur.com/ZwrXOoD) They would receive 1 grenade every minute, which would drop if their inventory is full. 

**The Recon**

The recon would be unlocked by killing 20 enemies from 100+ meters away. It would be based on long ranged combat, equipping it with a blue scoped AR, green hunting rifle, a green six-shooter in case of close-quarters combat, and 5 bandages, like [this.](https://imgur.com/42JYPy3) The AR could only be swapped for a higher tier scoped AR or a thermal scoped AR, and the hunting rifle could be swapped for any sniper rifles. 

**The Aerial Assaulter**

The aerial assaulter would be unlocked by killing 100 enemies while not touching the ground. It would come with a gray AR, a gray tactical shotgun (that could be swapped out for any shotgun or SMG), balloons, a grappling hook, and 3 airplane spawners, like [this.](https://imgur.com/P72WEyN) I'm not so sure I like this idea myself, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

**The Tech Expert**

The tech expert would be unlocked eliminating 25 players with traps. The tech expert would come with a gray AR, a gray tactical shotgun (that could be swapped with any shotgun or SMG), 5 impulse grenades (and would receive one impulse grenade every minute, dropping them in the case of a full inventory), 5 bandages, 20 traps, and 15 chillers, like [this.](https://imgur.com/ZRBrvgu)

In the same way you would lose rank as you perform worse (few kills, bad placement) but your matches would become easier and easier because of sbmm. 

This solves the problem of new players getting absolutely rekt in solos by better players as they now could play ranked solos vs people at their level. This would also mean that Epic wouldn't need to add items that reduce the skillgap because the skillgap wont matter. Now new items could be tested in the regular modes before being implemented into ranked mode too.

Most importantly, we could now also see who really is the best fortnite player.

tldr: Ranked mode lets players play against players of their level and items can be tested in regular mode.",FortNiteBR

But I feel the idea could be improved. As it looks like other people loved it too, here are my suggestions for next time.

* Remove balloons. It's low gravity anyway, and so many people just sit up in the sky. Grapplers are more fun anyway.
* Remove the semi-auto sniper. It's just annoying to be spammed by it, and it's overpowered in a mode where it's a one shot kill.
* Remove the heavy sniper. The only purpose of it is breaking walls
* Fix the glitch with grapplers where you can't change weapon until you use the grappler again.

I've heard a lot of people complain about no revives - I love it. It makes the game so fast-paced, it's so much fun. Also, be real, with the players in this game, if you get downed, you're 9/10 times getting thirsted anyway.

I think that with some tinkering this mode could be the most fun I've had in a long time.

I learned to live with the fact I'll never get lights on my Omega, but when I see people complaining about ""missing out"" because they were too busy to play the game, I just have to point out the fact that Switch players missed out even more because the game didn't even exist on the console and yet we got nothing in return.

Despite all this time that I’ve been playing, it feels as if I haven’t gotten better at all. I feel like around the end of season 4/start of season 5 is when I improved (very slightly) past “completely trash newbie” status and I’ve been stagnant ever since. Fast forward to season 7 and the game is more merciless and unforgiving than ever. 

The classic two tips I see everyone give others to improve are “land somewhere alone, loot and then work your way in” or “land somewhere busy every game and just practice combat”. I find both of those tips super flawed. 
The first one sees you not getting any practice in combat situations whatsoever, so you’re really not learning anything and you have a high chance of just fucking it up and dying the moment you run into your first enemy. The second tip definitely gets you a lot more exposure, but since the game is so flooded with crazy high-skill players these days, newer players (or ones like myself who are just trying to get better) stand virtually no chance against them and get instantly deleted before having any chance to react. Neither of those paths have helped me to improve much at all. 

So, what options do new and lower-skilled players have? I feel like for how long I’ve been playing I would’ve gotten at least SOMEWHAT better than where I’m at now, but despite having 4 seasons’ worth of time under my belt I’m pretty much nothing but a glorified newbie with some shiny skins. 

I think I keep playing through all my frustration purely because I really WANT to like this game, I love its cartoony, colorful style and it looks like it’s crazy amounts of fun if you can pull things off. 
But never in my life have I played a game that’s just so ridiculously brutal and cutthroat towards the new and the less-experienced. It seems as if the only way to “get better” is to bash your head against the wall and instantly die, instantly die, instantly die hundreds and hundreds of times and try not to get pissed off and quit the game in the process. That’s the definition of an inaccessible game. And I just wish I knew a better way.  ",FortNiteBR

——————————————————————————

-It’s called “14 days of fortnite”, why would anyone think it would go longer than the 14 days even with an unconfirmed Reddit post where the employee was even unsure

-there was a timer in the challenge section (which to see your challenges you had to go to). This timer has also existed for every other limited time challenge ever so it’s nothing new 

-you had 14 days to complete it, I had family in town and had VERY limited time to play this week (3 days out of 14) and I still managed to get everything. I have missed out on things before due to bad timing but that’s not a reason to bring back the challenges 

-for the people complaining saying “Man I was so busy, I really was excited to use these two extra days that were never confirmed and did not correlate with the very clearly present timer” you obviously just have nothing to complain about and need to latch on to something since you were so incapable of understanding how this game works (and has worked for the entirety of its existence. 

——————————————————————————

Overall I don’t know if the reddit community will agree with my sentiment or crucify me but I really think Epic should stand their ground and not bring back these challenges. 


TLDR; The people who are complaining that they didn’t complete the Holiday challenges because of an unconfirmed Reddit post are not a good enough reason to bring the challenges back

470,Feanor_Elf,1546448478,abv7cj,27,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/abv7cj/about_this_game/,1,About this game...,"So let's have a serious conversation about Fortnite. And before anyone thinks that I am a hater or anything, I want to clarify that I really like this game. The building mechanic, among other things, makes it unique and innovative and that's why it is the first shooter game I have ever played, aside from CS, but that was like 10 years ago.

&amp;#x200B;

But despite the good qualities this game has, it has some bugs or just straight up bad features that makes me want to delete the game and go back to Dota 2. What I want to discuss with all of you here in this subreddit, is these things. If there are any bugs or bad features I am forgetting, please comment below and I will add them to this sheet.

&amp;#x200B;

So the first thing I wanted to talk about is the airplanes. These things are the unbalanced shit I have ever seen in any game I have played. The fact that they have no ammo, no fuel and you can destroy buildings with minimum or no bad side effects for the pilot makes me furious. And to add more insult to the already broken feature, when you go through a building, if you happen to find on your way another player, you can actually push him forward and throw over cliffs or something and kill him with fall damage. I don't think there is anything else to add about the airplanes.

&amp;#x200B;

Next I want to address a building issue. I would like to call it a bug, but I am not sure it is a bug, because I haven't seen anyone talk about it. So have you ever built a wall or stair and a part of it is in the ground? I am sure this has happened to everyone, but I can't think of a rational explanation why this is happening. I mean, I expect when I build a wall to be built on top of the ground I am standing. Having a part of it, which sometime is almost all of it, being built inside the ground makes no sense and I have died several times because the wall or stair I built didn't cover me and I needed a second one on top of the first.

&amp;#x200B;

One more thing I have found myself wonder about is the floor and chest loot mechanics in the game. I think everyone has died because they didn't find a shotgun, there was no floor loot in the house they dropped, or instead of weapons in the floor, you find only bullets and/or healing items. Also everyone has played more than one games that he/she has opened many chests to find himself/herself having 3 common burst assault rifles, no armor etc. So what I want to suggest is to completely remove bullet floor loot from the game. Next they need to fix the randomizing algorithm about how the weapons are spawning in buildings, because it's really unfair for someone to walk into 3 different buildings and find no shotgun, and another person goes into one building and finds a shotgun, an assault rifle and 3 minis. Lastly I think that chests should only drop uncommon or higher rarity weapons, to reward the players that took the time and the risk going for the chest and not for the easy drop on the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

Next on the list are the zip-lines. While they are a really nice feature, which have helped me several times to escape from certain death and catch up with the moving circle, they have also killed me in countless occasions by accidentally using them without me wanting to. So I suggest is to put the zip-lines under the category of the ""Use"" button and whenever we are in a certain distance of one, there should be a pop-up message, like the one for vehicles or doors, that let's us know that pressing the ""Use"" button will makes ride the zip-line.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly let's talk about the sound effects in the game in general. Up until one point I thought that there was something wrong with my ears, or my headset, or the fact that I had never played a shooter game in my life and I couldn't distinguish where someone is going to come from or gunshots and airplanes will hide an enemy's footsteps from me, but no mine from him etc. But then I watched some streams and I heard the streamer ranting about the same thing and that confirmed my suspicions. I am not really sure what exactly should be done about this particular issue, but I know that there needs to be some kind of improvement to the sounds in the game in general.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude this nice sheet, I wanted to note that the only reason I am writing all this here is because I know that Epic Games pays attention to this subreddit and I hope I can help them fix all these things I mentioned and the ones you will probably write in the comments. Also, English is not my mother language, so I apologize for any mistakes I have made.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading and I hope we all have a happy new year!",FortNiteBR

Likely explanation: I know that most of you are around 12 or 13 years old. That means you only got into fortnite the last couple of months. So you never played fortnite in it's prime.

And because you didn't play the game in it's prime, you try to compensate for that by diving into other people's build fights with a plane. But here's the thing: fortnite isn't played in planes.

Epic Cheating For Them?,"It seems very evident to me that Epic Games intentionally puts low end and new players in more well known players and Pro players lobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

I just watched a video of Tfue Solo/Squads, he landed in Pleasant and left with 18 kills.

1 player the entire duration he was there built. He built 2 ramps then stopped.

Every single other player stood wide in the open, didn't build, didn't hide behind anything, and landed a total of maybe 4 shots on him altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Every single one of us know that 1 minute after we land 90% of people already have 200 mats, shield and a shotgun.

While in Tfue's lobby no one had shield and all had a Tac or pistol while he had a blue pump off rip.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not complaining about anyone building, I'm a professional player and can hold my own but no one builds in these guys lobbies. Even terrible players immediately turtle now, yet literally no one builds in ""Pro"" players lobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

So Tfue left Pleasant with 18 kills and went above loot lake. He lands 10 feet from people on a hill over him.

Tfue immediately builds....One of them builds 1 ramp, keeps his map out and literally falls off the ramp..Instead of using a shotgun they decide to shoot at him with an AR.

&amp;#x200B;

SLIGHTLY to his credit the next fight was two teams that were building against each other...BUT it was ramps and floors..nothing strategic or skilled. 

He deals 90 damage to some guy in the toe when 3 pellets hit.

No building against him involved, very simple.

&amp;#x200B;

Next fight -- 3 guys

1 of them gets domed, both others hit for 90 with hunting rifle..hits one from 4 squares away for 70 another for 130

&amp;#x200B;

Last fight -- 2 guys hard peaking, neither building. One is just standing at the top of a ramp holding down dynamite and gets domed. One falls off the mountain, stays in the zone, and never shoots at him and was possibly on mobile.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Epic Games cheats for them so fucking hard.

People try denying this shit, but it's so evident. It's not just one game. You guy to Ninja's channel and look at the absolute mobile bots that guy fights.

Epic dick rides Nick eh 30, Ninja, Tfue, Avxry, everybody on TSM, Dakotaz, literally all of their top streamers.

&amp;#x200B;

While they are better than most players, you see them fight a mediocre builder and they're ""Oh my god, a sweat, such a try hard, I don't even know why people try so hard in this game.""

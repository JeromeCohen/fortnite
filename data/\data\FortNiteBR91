I literally can't find a single thing that can be considered fun in this game anymore, it's all just ""you better sweat or youre going back to the lobby"" now and that's not fun at all. 

The fact that soccer skins raised in numbers tremendously with the skins re releasing in the Item shop is one of them.
Half the lobbies are soccer skins, man it's the new default skin. And I haven't found a single bad soccer skin, it's like only the pros bought them.

Casual play is gone for this game and if you got good your good for eternity and if you're still bad and can't keep up with anything like me, good try man but with how the game is rn me and thousands of casuals don't stand a single chance. 

I've never played fortnite competitively, I play games for fun, it's my hobby and I honestly never try to ramp rush or build a huge tower. I just play the simple loot normally and don't fight everyone, just shoot any unsuspecting player, and if they build the Burj Khalifa in .1 seconds then it's over. 
This style of play, aka the casual, is extinct, it's just impossible now. Even if I play daily for around 3 hours, I still suck because whatever I do I'll still get 1 pumped in the head by a sweaty soccer skin and stand no chance. 
The word ""fun"" doesn't fit anywhere in this game, you can't try to play calmly and easy and have some fun because whatever you do once you get to the final 1v1 you'll stand no chance. 

I've somehow managed to rack up 16 solo wins in 2 seasons, more than half in the present season, and its all in the luck, in none of those games did I ever find a soccer skin that sent me back to the lobby. The only type of match you stand a chance as a casual. Anything else, it's just a waste of time. 

Honestly there's only 1 fix, and I've talked too much about it so I won't even bother mentioning it.

this could potentially reduce the RNG component of a lucky wayward headshot/one pump.

I think it could make for a very interesting shift in meta.

Perhaps with a few tweaks, how would it fare in the normal playlists?","The sword is nerfed, and seems balanced, if not, underpowered. You can no longer build with it, and they put a full second endlag on the jump. It is now incredibly easy to keep your distance from it and kill it. All you have to do is build one ramp at a time while running, and if you do it right, they will never hit you with it. From there, you can simply spray them from distance, or pump them after they jump. 

Overall, its now easy to counter 1v1. And it gets gunned down incredibly quickly in squads. The only change I can think of is to make the total hp scale off playlist. 200 solos, 300 duos, 400 squads. 

The sword, while itself weak when fighting competent players, is extremely fun to wield and to fight. Wielding it is a completely unique experience to play. And fighting it feels like a boss fight, or fighting some sort of titan or god. Something about being just another ordinary character fighting someone with a giant sword makes it feel fun for me.

From a business standpoint, this makes a lot of sense, because the newer player will end up liking the game and putting money in to it (since there’s micro-transactions everywhere). These past two seasons (6 &amp; 7) are prime examples of Epic Games catering to the newer player and not caring for the “OG’s” if you will. Let’s see, the new 500 materials cap. Epic doesn’t want the more skilled players to be playing better than the newer ones, so they nerfed building. Planes, the first thing on anyone’s mind when they are asked about unfair things in Fortnite. They’ve done a good job at nerfing them, but they are still extremely powerful.

However I play on PC and so therefore the players are better when we play duos. I'm pretty decent, but he's obviously not good at all because he just started playing and so he dies every first or second fight and I gotta finish that game alone. He's okay at aiming, but doesn't know how to build at all. Since I'm a PC player and I'm not quite familiar with controller gaming, is there anything you guys could advise me?
He also doesn't like watching twitch or youtube, because he barely uses his smartphone.

I've told him that he simply has to play a lot and maybe ask his rl friends to play with him, but I feel like that's not the best advice. I really want him to get good at this game

So is there anything you guys would think helps him to get better?",FortNiteBR

The green and blue pump have a stupid difference in damage.  It is crippling to not have a blue pump because you can’t take someone’s shield off, one pump them or kill them early game where most people don’t have shield.  

This would in theory make the purple and gold pumps the only shotguns that can one shot you at 100 HP and one pump you.

If you manage to knock down a player you deserve the health because if you're against 4 players one can revive while two can fight you. This also makes players want to  thirst less.

The 500 mats cap has done nothing to reduce build battle frequency due to increased farming rates and the fact that people drop 50 mats after being killed, people are insanely aggressive now due to the 50 health or 50 shield for a kill thing, which means that I can't casually play anymore. It also doesn't help that people have become unstoppable when it comes to fighting, which has totally removed the fun from the game. Playing Fortnite casually is now impossible, no getting around it. You can't play team rumble, as that's full of tryhards. Any base gamemode has the same story. Squads or anything with revives is impossible to play at this point, as you're effectively just free healing for a far superior enemy team. I have no will to play fortnite anymore. Any attempt I put into getting better at the game always results in me failing miserably, and as someone who takes video games far too seriously, it ends up often putting me in a bad mood (yes, this is a me problem, not an issue with the game), and I don't think that's how a game like fortnite should be. Fortnite, in my eyes, is a game that would be really fun to play with friends if people didn't try nearly as hard as they do. How/Why do I know/think that? Because it WAS that way, all the way back in Season 3 and 4. People played for fun instead of to destroy as many people as possible. Fortnite was fun then. Now it just feels like a game where you can either spend upwards of 5 hours a day training yourself to become a killing machine, do crappy chores given out weekly by epic, or just be kill fodder. That occasional person who'll dance with you, or even let you go at the beginning of a game when they have a gun and you don't is gone. 

Now I know that the game cannot go back to the way it was, that's simply impossible. However, I do not feel that the game is fun or fair for really anybody at this point, and I don't know how to change it. Worst part about it all is that it's probably going to be like this until the start of Season 8, and if it doesn't go back to normal then, I doubt it'll ever will. Getting killed by tryhards no matter where you go, be it Solos, Duos, Squads, Playgrounds, Team Rumble, or the random LTM is **not fun.** The game itself has (and still is) declined/declining in quality drastically since around Season 4 or even 5. So why not implement a ranking system to balance it all out. It can't be easy, I know, but with Season 8 right around the corner, I think that'd be the ideal time to release such a thing.

It makes it really difficult to not get into a fight and when.

A battlepass costs 950 but you get i believe 1300 (ish) vbucks. So for the newbies in battlepasses, that means you shouldnt really buy anything other than an uncommon emote per season.

Recently while playing I have noticed just how terribly unbalanced shotguns are and I am curious why no one else is discussing this and complaining. I feel like the recent seasons have had some of the worst balancing for shotguns in all recent seasons. I also feel like the double pump was a lot more balanced than the system for shotguns we currently have but I will get into that later.

&amp;#x200B;

So to begin, when looking at the blue pump shotgun (which is the most commonly used shotgun and the one I use) it has a damage of around 60 for minimum at an average close range to 210 to the head. The headshot minimum is 100. This is ridiculous for a gun that is meant to have a slow fire rate yet high damage. An analogy is this. if I am in a fight in which we are both on 200 hp I can hit three body shots and if I am unlucky he could still be alive (THREE SHOTS !) he could then get a lucky headshot on me and get 200 damage and he wins the fight. That's a 1:3 chance he won, and he would now be considered the better player. See what I mean? I find it absurd that you can hit someone 3 times and he would survive due to one lucky shot. So what's my solution? Decrease the damage gap. Make it so that every close range shot does a minimum of 100-150 damage. That's fair. It has increased the chances that a better player will win by double. But no, EPIC want to tailor the game to the bad players introducing rng etcetera to make sure they stand a chance. It's ridiculous.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto the double pump. I am aware that there are many mixed opinions about this but let me just say this. I would much prefer to get killed by someone who is able to a hotkey and build at the same time that someone who can get a single lucky headshot. Even though it is a bit overpowered it has the skill to it which I like.

&amp;#x200B;

And so everyone is aware of the double pump is brought back I am happy for shotguns to stay how they are.

Okay so inevitably with shield per kill, the good players will kill off the bots a lot more and lot faster. 

But, if a KD like 3, is considered top 5% ish of player base on fortnitetracker, how come around the end of game when there’s around 15 people left, every match it’s someone almost the same skill as me and same k/d.

Never do I encounter someone a full 1 above or full 1 below end game with 15 left.

It makes sense if us with 3kd are better and will kill off all the worse players faster and be left with each other, but why is around 15 players of the top 5% always in my lobby.

There definitely is some sort of sbmm in place which is weak enough to never really notice or think about, but has a effect.



I just wish Epic would be transparent on if what I’m saying is true or if somehow I’m lucky enough to always have so many of top 5% always around my stats in the game.",FortNiteBR

Earlier today a man joined my Stepson's game, (SS is 9). He proceeded to harass my SS, and tell him that if he did not give him his number he would come kill SS and the rest of his family.","My SS being impulsive and afraid, did not come get me or his father,  and gave his number out. I had already asked him to take a break from Fortnite and wanted to make sure he was off, so I went in his room and something seemed off. I told his father, who asked me to get his phone, when I went to retrieve the phone, that was when my stepson told me some guy from the game was texting him. When I asked him how the individual got his number he told me about the threat and how he was afraid. He told me that this individual asked him for inappropriate pictures and when he refused the individual threatened to come find him and kill him. Luckily I caught my SS in the act of sending photos before something extremely serious was sent. His dad then proceeded to text this individual who tried to say that my SS said he was a girl who was 17 or 18. The individual also told SS that if he were to involve either me or his dad that he would find us and kill us.  This has been a terrifying situation for all of us, I have since reported,  but I want other families who have children that play this game to be aware. This individual tried to join a previous game that stepson and his dad were playing the day before. I have since reported the individual, but at the same time I want to blast this individuals name so more people are aware and can protect their children. Here is a picture I took of the individuals username. PLEASE PROTECT YOUR CHILDREN. https://imgur.com/gallery/63vDP1p",FortNiteBR

Since the 7.4 update I have had an issue where its like my frame rate drops to less than 1 FPS, what I mean is that, all the animation in the game stops, the sound stops, everything stops except for voice chat. My computer isn't locked up as I have had hwmonitor open on a second monitor and it is updating fine. CPU usage seems to jump from 30% to 100%. The amount of ""hang"" varies. The worst just happened. I was about to engage another squad, I had the infinity blade, and my game froze. It lasted 8 seconds and when I got back, I was dead and 2 other squad mates as well. This isn't just some isolated thing.

My PC specs are: i7 4790k, 16gb ddr3 1600mhz, GTX 970, 500gb nvme ssd as game drive.

Historically my specs have been more than adequate to play fortnite. I play @ 1440p 144hz and average 90-120fps. I have never had this type of problem before. I have changed my settings, updated drivers, turned down graphics options, removed all my skins, turned off GSync, changed resolution, set up Battleping and even directly hardwired my computer to my modem and eliminated my router, to no avail. I am 100% certain it is not on my side. Other people have mentioned similar issues but they seem to have been describing latency more than whatever is happening to me.

Tl;dr : Game freezes frequently, usually before engagements with other players, leading to 2-8 second freezes where my screen contents and sounds will all freeze. Voice chat is unaffected however and my system is running fine in the background. I've eliminated all environment factors on my side of the game.",FortNiteBR

Looking at the [""Week 11"" or ""Overtime Secret Loading Screen""](https://fortniteinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fortnite-snowfall-loading-screen-week-11-leaked.-Prisoner-skin.jpg)he is shown with his fist up looking very powerful, while it could just be his reaction to regaining his powers/strength, but it also could be him summoning up a fire storm/volcano in the same manner the Ice King did for the *""*[Frostnite"" event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9MUBckmBc4)*(just waves his hand around).*

Seeing as I mostly only played team rumble the difference is just shocking.

For some reason, Epic have decided to add gaining shield once you kill an opponent. 

In the mode there has always been a problem with people quitting the game as soon as their team goes behind. So you end up playing against 6 when your team still has close to 20. 

This is so patently ridiculous, because once your team goes behind and an opponents player gets a couple of kills, they become twice as difficult to kill, meaning the winning team can just hug the best positions and no one can touch them. 

The problem is even worse now, earlier on my team was down to just 3 players because so many people quit in frustration at landing, getting 4 or 5 shots in on someone and then still getting killed straight away because they have full health and shield and you have no shield.

Part of the fun of team rumble was it was so fast  and people were getting taken out on both sides leading to competitive games, that’s just been ruined now. 

I know part of the fun of fortnite is building, but it was nice to have a game mode where building was kept to a minimum, and you would only really need to build a small barrier in front of you. Now people can build huge structures and as soon as anyone lands they will have full health and shield and it’s twice as difficult to take them out. 

I’m actually pissed and really disappointed, I played this mode so much and in the past they made changes which made it more fun and quicker, like changing the patterns of the storm closing, but this has just ruined it ",FortNiteBR

Fortnite BR is a game i love, loved since i started, season 2 or 3, however, things are drastically changing with this new Heal-On-Kill patch. I can understand why the top 20% of the playerbase, especially the ones vocal online, love i., It's basically a buff for better players. They no longer truly require to carry health items, but can carry more guns/utility instead. I normally get a few wins a week(play 8-9 games a day on average), but with this patch, things are changing. Zero wins, now, this is not my issue, ive gone longer than a week without wins, sadface. However, the top players in the end circle now went from an average of 5-7 kills, to 15-20 kills, AVERAGE , in my games. Us 80% basic players, got nothing to compete against them with. 50 is simply too much, way too much. Fights are less fun, theres no more tactics required outside good killing skills, since kills will now heal you. Give us regular folk a chance again, Thank you.   


Speaking with friends, i have a few suggestions, one is to lower it to 10-15 for a kill. Another is to lower the health/shield gain with each circle shrink, down to zero gain from kills in the last circle, so how you managed your inventory, will actually count again for instance.  


Anyway, Thanks for a great game, besides this &lt;3

I would implement it in a sort of unqie way though. 

1. When a member of your squad dies, they drop an object that can be used to resurrect them. You take this object to a respawn point, use it, and your squad member drops in from the sky.

2. There is always only one respawn point, and it should always be at the center of the circle. This will balance the risk vs reward and lead to a lot of epic battles during the final circles. 

3. The resurrected squad member comes back with a random weapon and 50 wood, brick, metal. 

4. You can only resurrect one squad member per respawn point. So if a player is solo and wants to respawn their entire squad, they would have to wait for 3 circles. 

5. Resurrected squad members come back in a zombie skin. 

6. If a resurrected player (zombie skin) is eliminated, they cannot be resurrected again.

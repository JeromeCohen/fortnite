Why does the mobile version perform better? Why don’t skin textures load properly? Mobile can run at 60 FPS but the switch hovers around 15-30. The game is unplayable in densely populated areas like Tilted Towers off drop and high paced build fights. The game simply doesn’t keep up. In addition, Switch lobbies have been merged with PS4 and Xbox One lobbies which furthers the disadvantage Switch players face.

Epic has done a commendable job getting the game on all platforms, but if they can’t increase the performance on Switch shouldn’t we at least get an explanation on why it isn’t possible for the switch to hold a steady frame rate? Or at least an answer on if new improvements are coming in the future? What about a quick blog post explaining the situation so the community can at least understand what’s going on?",FortNiteBR

Nerf- I would love a nerf on the deagle. IMO fewer shots. Personally I would prefer 4-5 shots instead of 7.

He can reverse and he can use the boost but when he holds R2 to drive, the wheels just spin. I told him I would ask reddit.
Some info: 
-He is NOT using a scuf or any other custom controller. A search of this sub shows a dozen or so posts like this but they all turned out to it being an issue with trigger stops. He uses a normal, first gen PS4 controller on PS4. He has tried multiple controllers and the issue remains.
-No problem with R2 in any other area of the game. The other vehicles like the plane and shopping cart to not use R2 to accelerate and he is able to drive them fine. 
-The wheels spinning is interesting. If he were somehow holding brake and accelerate at the same time, the wheels would not spin. I just tested it myself to confirm.
-He has had this issue since day 1 of ATK release.
-I uploaded a clip of he and I with a quadcrasher. I am Bullseye and he is the Red Knight. As you can see I am able to drive the quadcrasher without issue but when he gets in the front seat and hold R2, wheels just spin. Reverse works normal.

There is nothing you can do about them if someone decides to take a shot at your side when you are running to circle, if they hit you in the head, you are dead without a chance to shoot back. Next thing is the public matches, they are currently either 1. get a plane and thirdparty every buildfight. or 2. farm mats for 15 minutes just for someone to thirdparty or snipe you. I dont see why epic games cant just add the rule set of the pop-up cup to the public match, would be more fun for everybody. Third thing is the planes themselves. They are too good imo. It removes skill from buildfighting as planes can just knock it down. it pretty much makes me want to sit in a 1x1 and wait for a plane to come knock the other guy out of the highground. As far as hosting tourneys epic should really start to listen to the pro-community. I don't think adding new stuff like sword to the game 10 hours before a tournament without testing it first is the right thing to do, especially if it is as op as the sword was. what are your guys thoughts on these things?

It wouldn't fix the planes ramming into your build fight but at least it won't damage you, seems like a reasonable compromise.

I believe that the main source of them being overpowered in today's meta is there are a few counters to them. So maybe some items could be adjusted to counteract these winged beasts.

- Guided Missiles turn into throwable hacking modules which can give a player that isn't in the ground full access to the plane's controls for a short amount of time, these could also be used on normal vehicles and any future vehicles too. Would come in legendary rarity. 

- EMP Grenades, similar to impulse grenades, these stick onto vehicles and once they detonate (short fuse) disable the control system for an extended period of time (10 - 15 seconds). Would come in epic rarity. 

and finally;

- A barricade, similar to a port-a-fortress with HP equivalent to that of the base of a turret platform, a single uneditable wall with a ton of HP which can be used to prevent all incoming damage from a specific direction. Would come in legendary rarity only but unlike other structures, planes will not instabreak them upon boosting.

Let me know what you think and how some of these could be tweaked, (I'm already expecting people to write off the barricade). ",FortNiteBR

Here are some things I think that could improve the game way more than it's current state.

* Add vampirism (gain 50 health/shield for kills) to the normal game. I like the pop up cups because I get rewarded for getting kills. I think it's very idiotic to punish players for getting in to fights. Especially with planes 3rd partying all the time, I feel like the vampirism would be a nice balance for them.
* Planes should not be able to run through walls and do 40 **health** damage, if you have shield then it should take your shield first. But, the gun on the airplane does way more than enough damage, if you get one hit with it, you're most likely going to get 2-3 more. If a plane runs in to a build it should stop. Planes should be used for travel only, not to one shot players.
* Heavy snipers need to be damage nerfed, I should not worried about being one shot in the body by a heavy sniper if I am under 150 hp. I think it's ridiculous how unfair it is that I can't do anything late game besides turtle because I am going to get one shot in the back by some new player on a point and click adventure.
* Six shooter and bolt action sniper need to be vaulted. I hate landing and opening a chest and automatically know just to leave the game. I like to land Tilted Towers and when I open a chest and see either of those items, I just have to leave. Also, vault burst weapons except for the Famas, I rather use a gray AR than a blue burst which is a bit silly.",FortNiteBR

if you are on console, put the console inside of a bathtub whilst it is plugged in.

They do not usually get kills, just drop your builds and deal damage. It sucks especially when, most of the time, you don't have shields. It's also problematic to shoot down the planes since one does not usually have a spare 50 bullets at the beginning.

This is a problem in some other landing spots as well, but mainly in pleasant park, where everytime about 2 people decide that the plane's gun is the only gun they'll need.

SOLUTIONS

1. Vault planes. We got enough mobility from the addition of rifts and ziplines in recent seasons, as well as quad crashers.

2. Nerf the planes. Less health, maybe a worse gun? Less damage to structures when flying into them?

3. Remove plane spawns near popular landing spots. Pleasent Park is the only big problem, but I have heard people complain about Dusty too (not a problem imo)

Mobility is not a problem in the slightest for this game, so the fact that the most mobile mechanic in this game allows you to have 30-damage turrets and the ability to kamikaze into structures (with very little drawback) is insane. Sure, you can shoot a plane down, but have any of you who support planes being in this game actually been in a squad fight with planes? As soon as you land, you are bombarded by several other planes and teams. 

In solo, sure, planes are relatively easy to destroy and you can get punished easily for relying on them. Squads? Jeez, it is nigh impossible to get into a fight against another squad with planes swooping down, lasering you with turrets/player weapons, and crashing into you with reckless abandon. The fact that you can get killed by someone ramming into you with a plane and the most that happens to them is their plane gets slightly weakened is depressing.

There are weapons and mechanics in Fortnite that are annoying, but they almost always have a counter or, at the very least, some degree of rarity. The ubiquity of and inability to properly counter more than a single plane is frustrating and has made this season, by far, the least fun for me to play. I am positive that not everyone feels this way, but it saddens me to see this game get ruined by *one* mechanic.

It also goes the other way: getting in the last circle with a teammate versus another duo or something? We will be able to crash into them and kill them before they can shoot us down. The fact is, the plane will do 30 damage a hit with 800 health and (when considering ARs), the people on the ground will do 30-40 damage a hit with 200 max health. Let's be real here, this should not be a thing.

So many children, as well as adults, just received their first ps4/xbox/pc/switch/hell maybe even an Iphone . 

From today on, we will see the biggest influx of players possibly ever to Fortnite. Last Christmas the game was getting bigger, but wasn't NEARLY as popular as it is this one.  Can we try to welcome them with open arms? 

Some of these players never had the opportunity to own a game system before. Whether it be their single moms that couldn't afford one or someone's parents/significant other that weren't going to drop the money in June to buy them. 

But you bet your ass, especially the kids, have heard about fortnite from multiple sources yet never played it, or maybe never really even play video games in general and want to see what the hype is about now that they can!  Imagine being that kid in middle school who doesn't have the opportunity to play when all of their classmates are flossing and talking about it every single day. 

I'm 33 years old and just played with one of my nephews who never had this opportunity.  As a day 1 player, I forgot how foreign this game can be to newcomers and completely forgot the things I learned in season one are not common knowledge to everyone.  But I've watched this subreddit go from a helpful place to an incredibly toxic one over the last year.  

There will be lots of posts in the next weeks asking ""bot"" questions. Let's help them along instead of ruining it for them. After all, we were all that bot once.  We all love the same game here.

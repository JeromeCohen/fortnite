However, I wanna get something to play on it smoothly and potentially get better. Idk which one is better. Should I get a PS4? Or a gaming PC? The ps seems more affordable for me idk.. but I’m questioning if there is lag there like if the processor isn’t good enough or....? Pc’s are not that cheap like minimum 600-700$ but also the quality is good. So I’m lost. I need help deciding. On which, PS4 or PC, will fortnite run decently, no lags (due to processor and not servers) and good quality?

Therefore players who want to play competitively but maybe aren't good enough (yet) to scrim can have a place to play. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say the best way to come along side ranked would be to base your rank off of VR's, being that the game isn't TDM and is focused mainly on winning the match, while kills help you get there and make you better. Epic can start out just judging rank off of Solo wins, but I believe it would be better to have that the rank is based off Solo, Duo, and Squad wins.   So no matter what gamemode you queue up for if you win it'll be added towards your overall rank. I believe it'll also make it easier to implement. **TL;DR: Wins from Solo, Duo and Squad count towards your overall rank.**

&amp;#x200B;

This way as you continue winning you'll be faced against people who are similar in skill. You may have a slight increase in campers but that's basically what Fall Skirmish is anyway. But in public games how many times does the gamer that's a bush win the game? It's rarely unless the other person gives them the win. **TL;DR: Faced against people of equal skill**

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my opinion on how the ranking system should work, the numbers can be adjusted to whatever this is just an example. I was thinking after reaching a certain threshold you'll be rewarded with some sort of cosmetic item. It be cool if they had names for each amount of wins (Similar to League of Legends when you're promoted). Maybe base the names of each rank off of skins so 0 - 10 would be Default Dungeon, etc. **TL;DR: Each Rank based off VR's maybe name them?**

&amp;#x200B;

* 1st VR : Rewarded an Umbrella (Like you are now for each Season)
* 0 - 10 VR's : Rewarded for reaching 10 VR's in Ranked.
* 11 - 25 VR's
* 26 - 50 VR's : Rewarded for reaching 50 VR's in Ranked.
* 51 - 75 VR's
* 76 - 100 VR's : Rewarded for reaching 100 VR's in Ranked.
* 101 - 200 VR's
* 201 - 400 VR's
* 401 - 500 VR's : Rewarded for reaching 500 VR's in Ranked.
* 500+

I'd expect majority of the popular streamers would be sitting around 401 - 500 or 500+ depending on how many ranked games they play. But this would also give the chance for people who don't stream to match up against some of the pros or well known players. 

In reality, smurfing is an issue in any ranked game so that isn't a plausible reason to not have ranked. 

**TL;DR Ranked based off total VR's in Solo, Duo, and Squad.**

I don't feel the need to buy a battle pass and have played each season since 3 to get all the free tier rewards. Each season offered something that wasn't available to free tier players the previous season. For example, I only had the default dance until season 4 with orange justice. Season 4 introduced sprays in the battle pass yet in season 5, the free tier got a spray. We also got backpacks, falling trails, stickers, sprays, and emotes like salute.

I was hoping that season 6 was going to continue the trend of introducing something new and then the free tier gets something from the previous season. I was hoping for a single toy. Instead, this season we get one emote that is not a dance (regal wave) and then a bunch of stickers and sprays. No music, no pets, no toys, no dance, no trails, and no skins (this is typical though so no biggie).

I don't see a point at all to play this season and there is nothing I can get from it. I know Epic isn't going to change their rewards at this point but besides LTMs like the dancing one coming up, I don't have any desire to play or do the challenges.

Hear me out before you instantly downvote.

First it was the Red Knight, then it was the Fourth of July skins, then it was Power Chord, then it was the Rogue Agent.

Obviously Epic Games doesn’t care about rare items anymore, and I wouldn’t be surprised at all if the Skull and Ghoul Trooper are going to come back this Spooktober. 

I think Epic knows that as long as they keep on bringing back “rare” skins, people will still buy them, and Epic makes money, and those skins aren’t rare anymore.

The environment I’ve always wanted in Fortnite when it comes to cosmetics is one where people wear things based on how they look, not when they were released.

I just want everyone to be able to wear whatever they want, assuming they payed for the sufficient amount of vbucks.

That’s most likely the environment Epic Games will create, and the only rare skins will be from the Battle Pass. And I’m one hundred percent on board with this idea.

The alpha items are worth upwards of 1000 dollars and psyonix will still never re release the items because they are ALPHA items and people don't want then to come back because they understand the value of having rare items.  Now if this was Fortnite, people would instantly call out that people are not entitled to an exclusive skin, but this has been a thing in gaming forever, especially in a game that is focused around cosmetic items.

After playing this game for a year. Achieving 500 wins on my main and my other 2 accounts having 100-200. I believe that I have enough knowledge to talk about this topic. the skull troopers and ghoul troopers are considered the rarest and best skins in the game. I don’t own any of them although I was there when they came into the shop. I also think they should come back. Due to recent scams because of their title “rarest and best skins”. If Fortnite can’t stop people from buying accounts or just getting scammed ( such as there other attempts like banning Tfue for buying an account and even mentioning it. Supporting the concept) their best chance is to bring it back. It’s their best call due to other community responding in the way they did with these skins. I don’t blame them, I don’t think they are trying to make money. They are just trying to help out the community by stopping scams.

A name change for the original Skull Troopers? Even an exclusive banner will satisfy me. I feel like as a developer Epic owes it to the people who supported their game before we ever knew what it would even become. Sure you can say “should’ve bought S1 Skins lul” but lets be honest, Renegade Raider and Assualt Trooper were EXTREMELY bland and not worth the $20 price point back then. 

I know no one from Epic will see this and I am sure anyone who started playing from S3 and beyond will cry in the comments that this is stupid but I promise you, I don’t care. Once Skull Trooper becomes the new default skin it’ll be forgotten just as Red Knight and Power Chord and the bandwagon fans will slowly beg Epic to release Christmas skins, which they will, and the cycle repeats.

Also! EVERY SINGLE person that cries about getting BM'd just got done doing it to somebody else before having it done to themself!

You reap what you sow, and you only have your self to blame for letting it happen.


TLDR;

Stop getting knocked and crying about the BM,  especially after you've just got done doing it to other people right before. If you don't wanna get BM'd then don't get knocked out.

Switch players shouldn’t be in the same matches as Xbox One and P4S4 users. Who thought this would be a good idea?

I have played games my whole life, and very much so all day every day when I was a young teenager. I definitely get the idea of Fortnite just simply being fun, but there is a lot of stuff going on to suggest otherwise when it comes to this game's addictive nature.

 I have been getting a lot of ads for it, and the characters look nonsensical. A rabbit suit with a hockey mask and grenade belt, a park ranger with a tank top, a knight etc. I get whacky games, but dude, what the fuck is this shit. This screaaaams just throwing shit in to get kids attention, and almost seems like it shoots for the autist crowd.

 I have kid relatives who do the dances, ask for fortnite money for cosmetics, all they do is talk about it, watch youtube videos of people playing it and screaming; it's been this way for months.

 Now now, look I played the game, it's not that fucking fun. You run around an open space until you find someone to fight, and maybe you'll be the last. Here's the issue, it's so easy and up to chance to play, that it touches on gambling a little bit. A good portion of the game is just that, chance, luck. Right place, right time. Even items are randomized and when you find a good one it's like ""winning.""

 There's no problem knowing your target audience, toys, cartoons, games, yeah that's kid stuff. The problem here is that this marketing, which is very agressive, encourages your kids to become more impulsive and bad with money. We'll see it years from now. I'd advise parents to turn this bullshit off.",FortNiteBR

https://www.extra-life.org/

Extra Life unites thousands of gamers around the world to play games in support of their local Children’s Miracle Network Hospital. Since its inception in 2008, Extra Life has raised more than $40 million for sick and injured kids. It is a 24-hour gaming marathon to raise funds and awareness for these kids across U.S and Canada. The donations stay local to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment, and charitable care.

##***Year 1 Review***
Last Year, Extra Life was a huge success. We raised $4272.75 last year between the subreddits for Duke Children’s Hospital &amp; Health Center, located near Epic Games’ studio. We partnered with various streamers to give away a ton of Save The World Game Keys, as well as this awesome [smasher statue](https://imgur.com/a/MIWpn).
We are looking to step it up and smash last year's amount, with a goal of **$50,000!**

##**Dates:**

Extra Life will take place Saturday November 3, 2018 over a 24-hour period from Midnight to Midnight Eastern Standard Time

##**Join Team Fortnite**

This year, we are continuing our support for Duke Children's Hospital &amp; Health Center. We are looking for a team of players to sign-up for specific hours to stream Fortnite: Save The World &amp; Fortnite: Battle Royale. You don’t need to stream the whole 24 hours. Anyone can join the team and anyone can stream.

So why is no one talking about the issue with console editing that I have been experiencing on PS4. I wanna say it happened around the start of Season 5. Before it didn't matter what building piece you had selected you were able to edit the one you were looking at. I notice that this issue is not occurring on PC since I sometimes play on PC.  On PC you can have your ramp out and still able to edit the wall you are looking at.  However, now on PS4 (idk about Xbox) you have to actually have the building piece selected that you wanna edit or have your pickaxe out to edit any piece you are looking at. It is really annoying and slows down fights and editing a lot.  If you are having this issue too can you please let me know what you did to counter it since I always forget about it and forget to pull my pickaxe out.  Also, now with the custom controls I switched by edit button to L3 but I still have to press O to confirm I wonder if this is a bug since I make O switch mode only and L3 edit mode only.  It's just the little things that can really affect ones gameplay.  Well anyways thanks for reading and if y'all are having this issue lets make this big enough for epic games to see it so they can resolve this issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

Peace,

&amp;#x200B;

259,streetwearofc,1538396819,9kfvga,47,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9kfvga/switch_lobbies_are_basically_xboxps4_crossplay/,1,Switch lobbies are basically Xbox/PS4 crossplay lobbies (not opt-in!),"I already made a post about this one month ago (when only Xbox and Switch were able to crossplay) but no one seemed to be interested in it so i'll try again (with new infos). Please note this only goes for Squad lobbies, Solo is same-platform, not sure about Duos though.

The day PS4/Xbox crossplay was announced, me and my friend (both Xbox) teamed up with a friend who plays on PS4 so we queued squads with leaving the Fill option on (this option isnt even available with Console/PC crossplay) and guess who we got as a 4th teammate? Right, a Nintendo Switch player.

I did the test a few weeks ago (before PS4 got the extended crossplay) queuing Squads with a Switch player (while i was playing on Xbox) and queueing solo squads on my Switch at the same time - we got matched into the exact same lobby, also our team got filled with 2 Switch players. The lobbies were very casual so getting 10 kills in a Switch crossplay lobby was like getting 2 kills on regular Xbox servers, everyone was just a potato (except maybe 5 other people, who were also on Xbox and doing crossplay I guess). This wasn't much of a problem back then because there were probably 80% of the players on Switch while the other 20% were Xbox players playing with their Switch friends.

But now, since PS4 has been added to the matchmaking pool, it's a sweatfest just like every other Xbox/PS4 lobby (non-crossplay) but for me as a longtime Fortnite player I didn't care as I was more than happy that I could finally play with my friends on PS4. However if you're playing on Switch with only Switch players in your team, you're at a huge disadvantage. 30 fps vs 60, occasional microstuttering on Switch and sometimes buildings don't even load. I honestly feel bad for Switch players having to compete against PS4/Xbox players, I mean there are still Switch players in those lobbies but as the majority owns a PS4 or Xbox and doing crossplay, there are maybe like 5-10% playing on Switch.

&amp;#x200B;

EPIC tells us Fill won't work with cross-platform (which is true for PC/console/mobile crossplay) but it has always worked with console-only-crossplay (Xbox/Switch back then) and they also tell us crossplay is opt-in which is just not true (at least on Switch) as you can see from my tests. I just don't get why Switch can't get their own servers, like Xbox or PS4 (Solos is still same platform only) ? Playerbase can't be that low. We were so shocked that we got a Switch player as a Fill when we were crossplaying with our friend on PS4. Switch players are between mobile and console players skill-wise, but most of them are just potatoes who have absolutely no clue what they are doing (mostly kids of course, and no this is not an insult, it's a fact that the majority who owns a Switch and plays Fortnite are between 8 and 14 years old, sometimes even younger). All I want is EPIC to look into this as it doesn't seem fair to play against other platforms when you do not have a player from another platform in your lobby (I mean this is the case for Xbox and PS4, so why not Switch? Switch has a disadvantage, yet they are forced and not even notified to play against Xbox and PS4 players)..

Let me tell you why:

1. **The Storm was no real danger anymore.** In almost every game i had up to 3 Bounce Pads. That means, i could easily get away from the Storm when it would normally hurt me and in some cases should've killed me. I know, other items exists that can be used to escape the Storm BUT they are/they were harder to find and two of them punishes you with Fall damage.
2. **Easy win in the Battle of High ground vs Low ground.** When you fight another player, it most likely ends in a Build Fight and the one with the High Ground has much more chance of winning than the one with the Low Ground. In Season 6 in my opinion without the Bounce Pads these Build Fights are really balanced. (You have the Grappler to gaing High Ground, but it punishes you with Fall Damage if you not use it properly.) But before, with Bounce Pads, it was too easy to gain High Ground. You just placed them and whoosh you are above them. Also the Bouncers had infinite uses.
3. **The Bouncers ""rare"" rarity, was not right.** The game was almost shoving you the Bounce Pads in your Inventory. You cant deny that the Bounce Pads were really easy to find, which made them really easy to practice and also they would be used in A LOT of fights.

*In my opinion, if they would change the rarity of the Bounce Pads from ""rare"" to ""epic"" to make them appear less, it would have been a good option instead of vaulting them.*

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to start off by saying that I play on Xbox, and that I would consider myself a ""near-professional player.""

Here are some of my accomplishments to justify that statement.

**Overall Stats**

* Over 1,750 Wins
* Over 1,200 Duo Victories
* 25% W/L Ratio
* 4.0 KD
* Season 3 Global Duo Leader Boards (25th place w/ 475 Wins)

**Season 6 Stats** 

* [https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/Brian270](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/Brian270)

Now that you know that I'm not an incompetent bot, I'll tell you why I, as a top player believe that the removal of Bouncers is a good thing. I'll split this up into a few parts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bouncer Skill Gap Issue**

Bouncers lowered the skill gap an incredible amount, some may argue the other way around, but typically high ground was given to the player with more Bouncers. While there are still ways to reach high ground without building (Grappler, Shockwave Grenades) these require you to use a slot in your inventory. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Grappler still leaves you prone to fall damage, and once used, you will find yourself moving in an unchangeable trajectory. This allows good players to land a shot on you right as you land/approach them or place a trap as you land. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shockwave Grenades only come in stacks of 2, and are hardly ever the right choice over healing or another weapon or utility item. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Why Bouncers Were Overpowered**

* Bouncers gave immunity to fall damage
* Didn't take a slot in your inventory
* Had no max stack size
* Were usable in many situations

**Why Bouncers Improve Late Game Play**

The Bouncer was typically used late game to launch yourself from a tower, or a large build to get yourself to the next zone without much risk of damage. I personally feel that without Bouncers in the game, there is a good time frame towards the end of the match that is more frantic and requires more skill to do well. You have to fight each other to reach the best position in the zone rather than just using a bouncer to reach zone. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Possible Indirect Benefits**

* Opens up the possibility for some new traps, utility items.
* A rework of Bouncers so they are more balanced
* New Meta
* More interesting pro-league game play

That's all I have to say about the removal of Bouncers. I hope you consider reading the whole post before commenting a poorly thought out response, or a one word answer. Be less frightful of change and adapt to game play changes, we're not even a week into Season 6 and frankly if you're the guy/girl frantically typing into the YouTube comment section, ""Like this if Season 6 is the worst Season yet,"" you're probably an idiot. Thanks for reading!

First of all you have the amazing beat compesition as it flows with the background instrumentals, it's a masterpiece of our time, truly a beauitful song for the world, and it is.

The sounds blending in with the song are like something out of this world, the vibe that comes with it is perfect, literally any milisecond could be taken and it will be a milisecond of masterpiece, not a moment during the whole song did it not feel like my ears were in heaven, the beats the vibes and the flow all mixed up together perfectly, they fit together like God made those beats to be together, simply amazing, and of course the amazing dancing from our skins themselves.

Im 19 years old and have been playing games all my life, since my Dad's old Nintendo's, until I got my first PS1, etc.

I just want to talk about how Fortnite feels like such a different game for me, even being at my age with a full time job etc, there hasn't been a game I have been genuinely excited about to check each day for the shop, counting down till new seasons, or just excited to play with my squad later on during the day. No one was expecting a game like this to get this big and have such momentum but I am glad it did.

Today at work, (I work in the Fruit &amp; Vegetable Department at a Supermarket) A young kid maybe aged 8-11 ish walked in with an EB Games Bag, just making friendly conversation I asked him if he was buying a new game and he said ""No a new controller so I can play Fortnite"", we kept talking as I was stacking the shelf and he was telling me how exciting Season 6 was and how he has played since Season 3, so I gave him a bit of a quiz just asking about guns and skins from Season 3 and he was spot on. His mum said he had to do some Chores for him to be able to buy the Battle Pass, I could see how excited this kid was to get home and start playing with his new controller and the kid in me just made me think like how excited I would be if I was his age again, and how excited I still am at this age. I decided to give him $15 cash I had in my wallet and told him its for the Battle Pass and at first he didn't believe me, and his Mum told me not too. But I insisted, just as a good deed and I just saw a younger version of myself in this kids eyes seeing how excited he was. 

His Mum told me that was there local supermarket so I told him to come and tell me what tier he was each week as Season 6 went on. 

Now I know this isn't like the biggest deal it's just $15, I just wanted to explain how I appreciate Epic's work and what they are doing with it, as they've already done more than I could have thought. With a good community (other than the people saying the games dying, which is dumb) it will stay this was and keep improving.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I gave a kid $15 for the battle pass cos he reminded me of my 11 year old self and I love fortnite lol",FortNiteBR

I had good loot and great border advantage and then I used a rift and it crashes my game. I should be able to reconnect. It doesn't make sense how PUBG can have a reconnect option but we can't. I dont see the problem

(Long),"A company called Vindertech was once obsessed with bringing a new age to the world, they constructed marvels of science and utilities once thought to be ones of science fiction. One day, they went to far. In an attempt to breed the perfect soldiers, they constructed an artificial island and took the world's best mercenaries and soldiers to put them into a sort of hunger games so they could prove who was the best, they did this splicing the successor's genes to produce an even better soldier than before. To ""Spice Up"" the Battle Royale they created, they introduced a man-made poisonous storm that would close in on them until there was a winner. Then came the Husks... The Storm Vindertech created broke out of containment and spread across the globe causing people to be poisoned and mutated into hairless, mindless, violent creatures known as the Husks. 

98% of the world's population turned into Husks, the remaining 2% were survivors on the mainland battling the storm, the last of Vindertech, and the unsuspecting soldiers still on the Battle Royale island. The Organization kept doing trials, hoping they could find the perfect genes to rebuild the world they destroyed. 

Meanwhile, a rouge Vindertech robot team assists a group of ex-soldiers trying to defend groups of Survivors from Husk Hordes, from their perspective, Vindertech has dissolved and they are the last survivors of the storm apocalypse. they use recovered Vindertech building technology and travel the world recruiting survivors for their cause.

Meanwhile, in the far reaches of space, an Alien Criminal known as the Visitor is being pursued by a group of bounty hunters known as the Enforcers. His ship eventually got so damaged that he had to eject using an escape pod. this pod became untraceable by the Enforcers and slowly started to accumulate a layer of space dust and joined an asteroid field whilst the Alien inside was still in stasis. When this asteroid belt came into earth's orbit, it was... Devastating... Whilst the larger meteor hit the mainland, Vindertech's island was hit by several smaller ones, including the one the Visitor was trapped inside. after months following the impact, they built a small research base they hoped none of the contestants would interfere with during the trials... but they did. The meteor eventually broke open and the Visitor escaped to a secret base where Vindertech was hiding a large amount of space rocks recovered from the meteors that dropped on the island.

The Visitor takes these Rocks (That have surprising anti-gravity properties) and his own technology to create a super-powered rocket. He then sent out a signal across the world to take cover from the potential fallout caused by the rocket launch. As the Rocket launched, the rocks on board caused the Rocket to create a rift through space-time that severely changed the world. Smaller Rifts started to appear across the world that transported things between dimensions. Such as  an entire desert being morphed onto the island and a man known as the ""Drift"" who claims to be an inter dimensional traveler who was em brewed with a mysterious energy.

The Rifts spread across the world, including the mainland where they were experimented on by several surviving scientists. one scientist actually stabilized one of these rifts and managed to transport herself and a group of survivors onto the island where they set up camp in several hand made lodges. 

The Rift above the Battle Royale island started to slowly condense until it manifested a mysterious alien entity. This entity was being controlled by another group of people who hail from a dark dimension. Their goal is to consume the world and turn it into a habitable one where they can then ""infect"" other dimensions remotely, like a virus. The Cube (Let's call it Kevin) traveled around the island and placed down strange encrypted runes before sinking into a body of water near the middle of the island, turning it into a solid rubbery substance.

Kevin then traveled below this substance and created an portal below an island on the lake, Kevin then attached to the bottom of the island whilst the portal it created carved it out and raised it into the sky like a floating island. well... not *Like* a floating island, *as* one really... As the island rose, the Runes started to morph the landscape around them into a dark, shriveled environment. They also started to produce a new rock from Kevin that could render an object invisible and not relevant to regular physics.

The new island disconnected from the vortex that was holding it in place and began to float around and backtracked, destroying the runes it placed before. Each time it would ""Consume"" a Rune, Kevin would grow like a tree through the island, making small growing clones that would eventually---

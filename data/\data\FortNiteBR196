It seems to reward the survival time the most &amp; doesn't differentiate between 1 kill or more. I know this could lead to bigger late battles, but I'm not sure if that's a bigger contributor than late reveal of circle while dropping.

I love dropping on the enemy side &amp; looking for fights, but the XP reward is so low, I feel discouraged to look for fights until late.

What does the community think? Is it fair as it is or can be improved?",FortNiteBR

8,AdvFaz24,1539013390,9mfywt,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9mfywt/matchmaking_rework_idea/,1,Matchmaking rework idea.,"One word: Placements. Account level or season level shouldn't matter since they don't really mean anything, just how much xp you've gained. My idea is to have 5-10 matches at the beginning of every season to determine who you get placed with. These 5 matches will count kills and time stayed alive. These can only be played in solos though. After placements are finished, you get placed in games with people who got similar results. This will be your default mode. If you start winning games more often or get higher placements over time you will be placed in games with higher-skilled players. But if you start doing worse you will eventually revert back to your default mode. Also placements are random, you could get placed with literally anybody in them. I kinda took this idea from Overwatch, so let me know how I can improve this idea and also tell me if you have any concerns with this. I really just feel that I get placed with a large variety of players, from extremely new defaults to people who are just 10x better than me. I just feel that people should be placed with others at a similar skill level, no more, no less.",FortNiteBR

We will make every attempt to work with them to get them their prize. If no conclusion can be reached, the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Unfortunately, with the nature of this drawing and complexity involved, this is the best option. Additionally, all winners must be comfortable sharing their shipping address with a moderator.*

My stats are super wack, and honestly I feel confused.

I have 0 solo wins, and my record is 0-1100. 

The weird part?

I have a 1 K/D.

While this might not be very high, I assume I should have at least 50 wins.

So the problem is with my mousepad. It is very small, 1/6 of Ninja's for comparison. I am a quick builder with my current sensitivity, (0.15/1000 DPI) but my aim is suffering. I consistently die after landing at least 3 shots each fight, but mostly low damage tac shots. I need advice on what sensitivty to run. 

Also, any tips for playing with high ping?
Thanks!

7 damage, meanwhile he one ticks you and you end up throwing your controller into your tv.
But how would I fix this?
Well, first of all, for pump shotguns, for green, a pellet hitting your target should do 10 damage, and every pellet that hits multiplies that by 2
For blue have it be the same but a pellet does 15/20 damage.
For double shotty, make it so it can one shot again OR make it so it could do more damage at a slightly longer range. I wouldn’t make it so it has 8 shots because that’s too damn op. For tactical and heavy, make the base damage for both 20 because I have seen countless clips of people doing somewhere near 7 damage with a purple heavy.

Also, and this is unrelated to shotguns, just make nerf the p90 it shouldn’t be able to shred you instantly.

The gamemode can be satisfying but there are always a lot of games that end before the major fighting even starts. 

I think for starters, I believe the starting circle should always be somewhere in the middle of the map so you don't have one team with significantly more players at the circle, which usually leads to an easy win for that team. 

I have games where I am not really close to the circle so I have to rush to the circle or I have a good land and a lucky roll of the dice with the circle and most of my time is grouped up together. But either my team has dominated or we were annihilated before I see a fight and that happens pretty often from my own games. 

If the circle were closer to middle of the map, it would give each team an easier time getting with there teams in a battle. I know you will be fighting in the same areas which may get stale for some but if the teams are a little more evenly matched then I believe the games will just be more enjoyable for all. 

I am not sure if this is place where I should put this but this was something I was thinking of but if Epic sees this, thank you for all the work you put into Fortnite. You made something really special in the gaming industry and I hope to continue seeing more success for the game down the line. 

I would also love to hear other thoughts or ways to improve 50v50 seeing as though that style of game mode may be around for a while.

&amp;#x200B;

One major issue any Fortnite player can agree is the most common and annoying is being third partied, or being shot at by another person/team when already fighting. The #1 reason for this issue being so common is overlooked often, and it's because of the map.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me break it down. Fortnites map is very tiny because of the lack of transportation, and with that you need an even balance between POIs and transportation. You can't have too much or too little of one or another, but also not too much of each.

&amp;#x200B;

Why this is just now an issue is because there has been a huge spike in transportation. With the addition of Rifts, ATKs, Launch Pads, Chillers, Rift to Go's, Grappler, Shockwave, and more, it has made traveling much easier, while POIs stay about the same.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead of getting rid of most of these items (although vaulting the grappler isn't too bad of an idea \*wink wink\* ) I suggest having another map update. Season 6 didn't bring much of a change, so here's my idea of a map. It's just a rough draft, and I'm open for any suggestions.

&amp;#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/a/8MnwCkX](https://imgur.com/a/8MnwCkX)

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain some of the changes.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Junk Junction\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

I removed Junk Junction because of it's lack of anyone landing there. It seems to be a dead zone, and with there already being another POI Northeast, it seems useless.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Snobby Shores\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Viking Village has taken over most of the west side landing, and Snobby has always been a dead zone.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Tilted Towers\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Let's face it, a place where half the lobby lands isn't a good idea. The majority of the community has been with the removal of Tilted, and there's even a Anti Tilted Towers Cult (@Smii7y)

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Greasy Grove and Fatal Fields\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Greasy Grove used to be a high and mighty spot to land, but now with the rise of the Tomato Cult, their town got overrun. Now a farm has moved into its location. But seriously, Greasy feels like it would be better farm land than where it was. A new Durr Burger shop will open where the Hey, BOO shop is now in Retail Row, and a group of houses now is where Fatal was.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Flush Factory\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Dead Zone, and with the new factory very close to it, no body even bothers with this spot anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Village on mountain west of factory\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

A small village, about 4 houses, has made its way on a mountain near the cost. They have nice residential homes and a tiny taco shop.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lucky Landing\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Although this place was very beautiful, the place had bad loot for how quickly you had to loot and run to storm.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Salty Springs\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This place has always been a target since it is dead in the middle. The place has awful loot, and I felt it deserved to go away.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Dusty Debris\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Yevin the island has made its way to all the runes, and has plopped himself in the divot. Now the only things that remain is the loot lake house, and one and a half warehouses.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Loot Lake\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The vortex in the middle of Loot Lake sucks up all the water in the lake and turned it into a dirt hole. After a while the grass grew and it became a field.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Tomato Temple\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

The government felt the cult was getting too strong, and destroyed the heart of the cult. Now the tomato people have to relocate, and their new home is where the detective agency is in Retail Row. There is a Durr Burger and Petes Pizzria battle going on in Retail.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Shifty Shafts\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Shifty Shafts got moved to where Tilted Towers to be a more convenient and out there landing spot.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*Lonely Lodge\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Lol did people still land here?

&amp;#x200B;

Thats all for my changes. This is just my opinion on things.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I'm not too good at PS my bad.

Me and my freinds play squads and often there is only 3 of us so we do squad fill. Firstly the names we get matched with just seems so random and nearly always have numbers at the end. I get that many people have numbers but these just seem so random. Then when the game starts and u watch them move and interact it is terrible. It doesnt look like they are being controlled by a human.  They seem to track towards items like trees etc but nothing seems to be done with any purpouse. Like you can watch them run from one side of risky to the campervan on the hill running past chests that are straight in front of them to then hit a tree and get some wood. Even if we are attacked the random will still just keep farming and there will be no reaction to seeing or hearing enemies. After playing with randoms in squad fill me and my freinds are pretty convinced there are bots filling in extra squad spaces. I get some people can be really bad at the game and new to gaming in general but still to be able to not react or interact to certain things in game seems too weird. Even the way they walk and move seems weird. I watched a player the other night who was walking in no general direction and walking slower than regular walking. Almost as if his stick had been moved 1mm.  I have never seen any confirmation of bots in game but we are all pretty suspicious afyer the constant random actions if our fellow random squad mate. So whats your thoughts do they have bots to fill squad spaces?,FortNiteBR

Season two battle pass was an actual Battle pass, not just cosmetics you could buy in the Item store. That's my take it on it anyway &amp; I mean they could just never release any of that stuff again (which would also be fair. 

Also to anyone who hates on this post, I'm not saying they SHOULD re-release this stuff.. I'm just saying if they ever do its the only fair way to it! Sick of seeing posts/rumours or comments ""this skin will be back/this skin should definitely come back Epic"" etc etc. ",FortNiteBR

I don‘t have them and I don‘t want to have them. I just buy skins if I think they look good or are funny like the Durr Burger one.

Now I heard the rumor that Skull Trooper will come back to the shop.
It is a lose-lose situation for Epic Games:
If they bring those skins back many of the „OGs“ will lose their mind because it‘s no symbol anymore for them.
If they don‘t bring it back nearly every other plsyer will get angry because they are thinkong they will be able to buy them since those leaks.

My suggestion:
As this skin is very rare and maybe the favourite fortnite skin of all time...
...Epic could give the people, who had their account created before the skull trooper came out, the chance to buy it again on Halloween. So people that have played since the beginning and are furious about the skin that they didn‘t buy have a last chance.
The other players will have to live with the fact that they started playing to late and will be able to buy the female skull trooper. (If the leaks are right)
This skin is available next halloween too but in the same way the skull trooper will be this year.

I thought about that and it coulf be a peaceful solution for everyone.

Put me in PC duos or squads and I do fine, but PC solos are absolutely fucking insane. I just find I lose my patience so much more. Everyone seems so adept and the RNG seems to be amazingly in others' favor.

I'm the type of person who spends 5 hours a week in playgrounds practicing building. I watch streamers, I watch tutorials just to keep knowledge fresh and I practice all the time, yet PC solos are really just maddening. Some days I do fine, other days it's all out chaos and I get one shot from every possible angle 30 games in a row, no matter how well I'm building or practicing what I've learned.

There's something to say about the whining people do and how they say this game caters to casuals. There's no fucking way PC solos cater to casuals when half the players you go up against seem like they're in the top 10%

I know I sound salty but I've just had the worst 30 games yet. Nothing worked in my favor, whatever could go wrong did go wrong.",FortNiteBR

So with the release of the fortnite battle passes is was getting curious to see if it would be possible to complete an entire pass worth of challenges in just one game.

So after doing some research i planned on making a video about it. So here it is. 

I could really use some feedback as im not really used to making videos that involve a lot of editing and researching. Hope you guys like it!!

You should be able to go into the other seasons such as 2,3,4,5 if you didn't complete them already.

Some people just don't have all the time in the world to get max tier.

Just wondering why 9/10 times when it's late game our team is pretty much snowballing the enemy, everyone is spread out searching for that last guy yet I have team mate(s) destroy the ramp/fort I've made to scout/snipe over the land and I end up plummeting down taking away that nice high ground. This happens very frequently, to the extent that I'll go out of my way to build another tower but 10 seconds later they are shooting in my direction, once again destroying that sweet sniper spot I just made.

Why do you do this? Is it because ally indicators are not visual enough (e.g; am I being mistaken for an enemy) or are people merely being a bit too trigger-happy and shooting all kinds of random things?

If the former is the case then I feel there are some visual details in the game that could be improved upon to make team mates stand out more; option for ally head marker to be green including the color of processing/finish building to have an alternate 'flash' color such as green instead of the reddish hue I often see.",FortNiteBR

Some changes I would suggest if they were to bring it back.

1. Change the rarities to rare &amp; epic (and match it to those drop rates)
2. Make the base damage be 23/24 with a 3.25/3.15 reload time. This would make the DPS 207/216, which would make it essentially equal to the common/uncommon SMG. 
3. Decrease the damage to structures down to equal the compact SMG

I think this would make it a viable pick up, since it would have a higher fire rate than the AR but less damage, and more damage than an SMG but less fire rate.",FortNiteBR

I've started using a different pickaxe (for two days now) and the crashes disappeared.

That being said, the best times I had in this game was when the BR mode was just released and nobody built. Okay, I take that back, people built but back then, but when you built you just put up a couple of ramps and maybe a few walls. 

Since then I've given your company hundreds of dollars on skins, battle passes, and other cosmetic items. But then something bad happened. People got good at building. *Really good*. Gradually the shift focused over to building instead of shooting. I posted my complaints here, as well as the official Epic forums to suggest different ways to nerf building. I said to cut the maximum number of mats from 999 to 300. I said to put a cool down when people spam walls in the same spot. I said to put no build zones in the game. It's quite clear that Epic never intended for building to turn into what it is today. The inclusion of C4, SMG spam and other items are proof of that. Yes, what separates this game from other Battle Royale's is its building mechanics. But when you give players enough mats to make a building fight last 5 minutes, something's wrong. Now you alienate the people that like shooting over building. Don't even get me started on bloom.

It's been a few months later, and I see no attempts to change the building mechanics in this game. My patience was thin already. Guess what Epic, you just lost a loyal customer. One that was with you before your game blew up. My focus will shift to Black Ops 4 on Friday.

&amp;#x200B;

To start things of i think they should bring back the double pump, not the season 1/2 double pump, but the season 4 one, that was not either trash or too overpowered.Then they should consider adjusting the double barrel a little so it's not to overpowered when having 2 shotguns and at the same time make it even more high-risk high-reward weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

Next, they should buff smgs to their peaks, as they were before the hotfix, add the drum gun back with some adjustments and lessen their ability to shred to buildings to make them harder to use.

&amp;#x200B;

And last, but not least, they should remove bloom.Don't add recoil, that just wouldn't suit the game, but make guns reward skill and not luck.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S: if possible remove grenade launchers and make purple heavy sniper deal 147 damage, thanks.",FortNiteBR

Epic seriously needs to fix their account security and support. 

Recently my account was hacked, and the hacker was messaging me on discord and kept logging me off while I was playing and spent my VBucks that I was saving. Before that happened, I had changed my password three times and disabled 2FA and re-enabled it in hopes that it would lock the hacker out. It locked me out of my account, but not him, and he was still able to kick me off. I checked and no consoles were linked to my account either. The security of accounts is ridiculously flawed. He kept my account at hostage unless I linked his PSN to my account (which I wouldnt.) I contacted Epic asking them to force log out all devices in hopes that he wouldnt be able to access my account after that. and it's taking a ridiculous amount of proof that I own my account just to force log out all devices, and he still has access to my account and is wreaking havoc in both gamemodes for me while i try to get him out.. Is this how the company should run their game? I think not. Epic seriously needs to look at their security measures and try to find the exploit he's using and patch it.

But with BO4 coming out, I will not be playing Fortnite again. Here are the infuriating aspects of this game:

1. Bloom. It is a terrible. The randomness in this game can be infuriating. And when you absolutely melt someone, you know that RNG could have easily caused you to miss several of your shots. Players who care about winning want their bullets to go where they aim- it’s really that simple. First shot accuracy is not a great solution. BO4 will be a breath of fresh air.

2. Wall strength. This game was incredibly fun when walls could actually protect you. There have always been frequent little hiccups/bugs that could cause walls to not place or to place incorrectly. Before it was okay because building was strong enough to compensate for those few hiccups. Now walls are so weak that every inconsistency in building is more noticeable because you are taking massive damage. Now you can spam stairs and walls in front of you for protection and someone can easily melt you through both layers of defense. And then when one of those hiccups/bugs causes a wall to place slowly or to not place at all, well, then you are screwed. (And don’t forget that the number of shots that connect with you through your walls is, of course, very random).

Building in this game has become infuriating. I would rather not have a building mechanic in my game if the building mechanic is going to suck. BO4 will be a breath of fresh air.

3. Shadow stones. I have not been killed by people using these things very much. So I wouldn’t necessarily call these things infuriating, but they are most definitely stupid. These should not be a thing. Who at Epic thought that this would be a good idea? It sounds like a concept an 8 year old would come up with. Stupid.",FortNiteBR

As someone who has been subscribed to this subreddit since Season 1 and watched the game evolve, it is wild to see how mindset of this community has changed as the majority of players has transitioned to younger kids who, by taking advantage of Epic's fantastic community involvement, seem to be extremely entitled and lack the ability to critically think about many issues or events that come up in the community. As an example, the obsession with the idea that iDropz_Bodiez cheated during his first week win despite the MASSIVE amount of evidence and data that was observed by Epic. There is so much cognitive dissonance in relation to that guy. Most users in my experience choose to believe that he cheated and when presented with countless facts against that belief they backpedal as far as saying Epic was in on it themselves in order to prevent themselves from having to feel *wrong*. This is one glaring example, but anything slightly controversial on this subreddit (whether it be a player, an item, an event, etc.) never even has the ability to be engaged by productive discussion in the community. If someone says something that is not the popular opinion they are downvoted and flamed by the rest of the community regardless of how it is presented or how true it might be.

With this said, it wasn't until the end of Season 3 that the community's mindset began to shift in regards to exclusive holiday skins. At first, the community loved the idea and appreciated certain shop skins being more ""special"" than others because they were associated with a holiday. After, in my opinion, the playerbase shifted to younger and younger players as Fortnite became more popular and more accessible, there was a distinct shift that occurred. It started with proposing the idea of re-releasing exclusive skins and players wanting the ""rare"" skins. At this time the community still believed and accepted that holiday skins were not coming back. Once the Red Knight was re-released, the community's mindset shifted overnight. Skins like Nog Ops and Skull Trooper releasing again became a possibility and just like that the playerbase instantly assumed that holiday skins would re-release. They adopted go-to reasons like ""Epic will make so much money, there's no reason not to."" Anyone who opposed their wishes with logical reasoning never even gets a logical response. It turns into a bunch of useless name calling and hive-mindism.

I also think it's important to note that there is nothing wrong with people like things that are rare. It's why we attribute value to rare minerals like gold. Scarcity (although semi-artificial in this case) increases value. I use certain skins sometimes only because they are rare and it's a cool feeling being recognized for having participated in past parts of the game. This is a feeling that the whole community can have without players in the past who bought these exclusive skins losing that feeling.

After critically considering the idea of exclusive holiday skins and what the pros and cons would be, both long-term and short-term, I have come to the conclusion that **Epic nor the community would benefit long-term from re-releasing past holiday skins and continuing this in the future.** Here is my reasoning why which I would love to hear arguments against:

* Epic will make more money **long-term**. Short-term Epic might make the most income they ever have from a single shop rotation. However, for reasons I'll go into below, the likelihood of players buying skins will decrease overtime. There are many players out there who have bought skins simply because they were sold under the guise of being exclusive and having something to represent your play time. Without this, I think players will be much less likely to purchase skins if they know they can buy them again at some point. A big reason why the item shop is so profitable is because we do not know when skins will re-release. This creates a feeling of ""I need to get this now or I might not be able to get it again for a while"" or, even more powerfully, ""I might not be able to get this again."" Epic destroys that final incentive by re-releasing holiday skins which I think will outweigh the short-term profits they would receive. As it stands currently, myself and most of my friends have decreased our V-Bucks purchasing ten-fold since the earlier seasons of the game despite the arguably higher quality skins releasing. I think this largely a result of a feeling of decreased value in skins as a result of over-saturation and lack of the diminishing incentive that the skin might not release again in the future.
* The ""coolness"" of many of these holiday skins will decrease exponentially with a re-release. Skull Trooper in particular will become a worse Red Knight within a week of releasing. I foresee it becoming a meme skin for bad players. Seeing a Skull Trooper in-game is different than most skins **because** so few players have it.
* If Epic were to release exclusive holiday skins each year that do not re-release, they would be allowing newer players in the community to have something that will increase in rarity overtime like the Skull Trooper. Players who bought past holiday skins thinking they would not release again would not feel mislead and have the coolness of some of their favorite skins erased and players who missed their opportunity will have the chance for exclusive skins as well.

One counter-argument I anticipate immediately is that Battlepass skins should be the only exclusive skins available. I have no problem with the idea of this if Epic were to explicitly state it. I think it's important that Epic begins making it much more clear what skins will be exclusive, if any, in the future. This shadowy concept of never knowing when or if a skin will come back is obviously profitable but will have some major issues in the future. Due to this business model, Epic has created this problem over exclusive holiday skins releasing. No matter what they do now they will likely upset part of their player-base. This could have been avoided entirely by being more straightforward about what skins will not release again and following through on that. There was a big impression felt from Epic by the community that the Christmas and Halloween skins would not release again in the future. Although it was never stated, their wording indicated that they would be and contributed greatly towards the sales at that time I'm sure. Slowly this has shifted overtime with Easter skins continually releasing, Red Knight re-releasing, and Elite Agent re-releasing despite being labeled as exclusive. It's created this toxic space and Epic alone have the power to end it.

I would love to hear arguments against my opinion that Epic and the community would benefit long-term from maintaining holiday skin exclusivity.",FortNiteBR

Now, the shotgun pellets are at a fixed variation for every shot.

The concept of the timer is great, I love it and I believe it should stay. I've played since the game came out so I've used just about every type of shotgun update there was.

I don't miss double pump, but I do miss being able to one tap with a pump, that was one of the aspects that I believe made me, and many others, fall in love with Fortnite BR. I don't know if this will make it towards the top for others to see, but I want my opinion to get out.


I think Fortnite should keep the shotgun cooldown timer and the fixed pellet variation, but restore the previous damage capabilities of the tactical shotgun and pump shotgun. 

Also, the ability to shoot my weapon right after I pulled it out was the best feeling in the game. If I was in an intense situation and need to switch from my AR to my pump, I should be able to shoot it ASAP. I say this because after this ability was removed, building became more of a need with the weaker weapons and the meta changing. The ability to shoot my weapon as soon as I pulled it out made the game feel more fast paced and gave my combat a better sense for the need of good reaction time and aim.

3)I'm really annoyed that people keep saying that the gap between PC and console needs to be closed. You made the decision to play console, so you can't really blame anyone for your inferiority to console players. If you want to close the gap, switch to PC, or plug your mouse and keyboard into the PS4. Don't complain that your peripherals are crap, because until August I played with a broken mouse, and I still use a shitty keyboard and have pieces of paper for a mousepad.

4)The learning curve on PC is insanely steep. It took us PC players months to get to where we are, and it's not because our controllers are better. It's just that PC players are more likely to spend more time practicing die to the skill gap.

I don't like the fact that the battle pass has majority female skins rather than male skins because me, being a guy, would rather be wearing a male skin rather than a female skin otherwise I would be gay. Not only that but one of the few male skins there are is a joke skin. I would be ok with this if there were more male skins but since there aren't, im unhappy since there are very few other choices. As well as this, one of the upgradable skins is female as well, and this is the first time it's happened. I like to say ""if it ain't broken, don't fix it"" and epic has done the opposite of this. Added to that is the fact that the female upgradable skin is the first upgradable skin so there's a chance that I might not even be able to unlock the full upgrade of the tier 100 skin since its the last one and I have other things to do than play fortnite all day long. Also this game would mostly be played by guys since it's shooting so I don't get why epic is putting so many girl skins in the battle pass, especially putting a female upgradable skin.

It's just a frustrating concept that you lose a round just because this one enemy at the beginning of the game was a bad loser and finished.

There could be multiple ways to fix that in my eyes issue.

For example, Epic could make it **impossible or** atleast **much harder** to finish someone, when his **mate is nearby**, or simpler just make a longer **protection** time. 

As compensation the knocked ones **view could get blurred** and so he can't define what's the enemy or something else, so he can't give calls to his mates where the enemy is and what he's doing. Additionally a knocked player **drops all his things** like **healing, mats and guns so there is no need to finish anyways**. Shortly, beeing revived is like starting a new game but with lower hp. 

The only exception I would accept to have an **instant finish** is when beiing killed **by a sniper.**

I think it would make the game **less TOXIC** an **more FUN**!",FortNiteBR

Bullets should have a bit higher of a percentage chance of your bullets hitting your target the closer your target is to the center of your crosshairs, and a bit lower of a percentage chance of your bullets going to the outer circumference of your cross hair. The size of the crosshairs are fine right now, just not the bullet spread.

**Shotguns:** Time between shots should remain the same for Tac and Double Barrel, but Heavy Shotgun gets a decrease due to its rarity and damage level.  Reduce the number of pellets, increase the damage per pellet, and have a much more (but not perfect) even spread of the pellets that barely gravitate more towards the center of the crosshairs when you shoot (to avoid multiple pellets landing on the outer rims of the crosshairs).  Having a more even spread of the pellets will make it so that a low skill shot can’t result in more than one pellet damaging a player..

Here is the order of crosshair size/pellet spread:

Tactical Shotgun
Heavy Shotgun
Pump Shotgun
Double Barrel Shotgun

Why the heavy shotgun with a larger spread than the pump shotgun? Due to its increased damage and the fact that it’s time between shots should be barely faster than the pump (about .2 seconds).

**Note:** Low skill shots are 1 pellet hitting the body, high skill shots are all 8 pellets hitting the head.

The following stats can get rid of the 6,7,8,9 damage shots. There should be 8 pellets per shot. Here’s the stats for each shotgun:

*Gray Tac:* 10 damage per pellet with a x2.0 headshot multiplier per pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 10, high skill shot is 160.

*Green Tac:* 10 damager per pellet with a x2.1 headshot multiplier per pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 10, high skill shot is 168.

*Blue Tac:* 11 Damage per pellet with a x2.0 headshot multiplier per pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 11, high skill shot is 176.

*Green Pump:* 10 Damage per Pellet with a x2.15 headshot multiplier per pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 10, high skill shot is 172.

*Blue Pump:* 11 Damage per Pellet with a x2.045 headshot multiplier per pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 11, high skill shot is 180.

*Purple Heavy:* 11 Damage Per Pellet with a x2.125 headshot multiplier per pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 11, high skill shot is 187. 

*Gold Heavy:* 12 Damage Per Pellet with a x2.0 headshot multiplier per pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 12, high skill shot is 192.

*Purple Double Barrel:* 11 Damage Per Pellet with a x2.216 headshot multiplier Per Pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 11, high skill shot is 195. 

*Gold Double Barrel:* 12 Damage Per Pellet with a x2.052 headshot multiplier Per Pellet. Minimum damage for a low skill shot is 22, high skill shot is 197.

Why does the green pump have a lower max damage than the blue Tac? Its rarity, and the fact that its crosshair size is now the second smallest, allowing for a much higher chance for a high skill shot than the blue Tac.

Myself and a few others at work have discussed how we are not enjoying the game anywhere near as much as we were and it is simply because we only play a few hours a week due to work and family, and we are getting left massively behind. Before anyone starts, I am not whining because I am not good enough and should just practice more. It is true am not good enough BUT given limited time on it each week, I am getting battered by people who clearly spend a lot more time on the game than I can meaning I have no hope of closing the gap.

This time last season we were all raving about it and convincing others to try it. Now we are simply dropping into games and dying or getting into battles with someone who builds a structure more secure than Fort Knox in 0.3 seconds or picks off the 2mm of you showing above a roof from 100 yards away with a SMG.

I used to love the 50's LTM as the better players stayed away form it, that gave me a bit of time to actually weapon up and get some shooting practice. Myself and my daughter used to team up in there and would have a bit of kill success, but the last two weeks she has not wanted to play because she 'is not good enough to even shoot at someone'. Since the 400% weekend the better players have seen 50's as easy XP and I just got ambushed by 6 rapid builders, at Lazy, when the dividing line was horizontal and they dropped south of it. 

Personally, I do not see the fun in being good at a game but seeking out rubbish players in a mode where stats don't count anyway but you will always get that. Probably the same mindset as the teammate that impulsed me off the Viking Ship mountain because I got to a chest first.

So, those who can invest a lot of time playing are getting extraordinarily good. Those who do not get to spend a lot of time playing used to get a little bit better the more they play but now often cannot even get to fire a weapon before dying so are no longer improving.

The game holds a lot of stats for players - hits, accuracy (not that it seems accurate), damage to various items, distance etc. It cannot be difficult to give each player a hidden rating based on these and an option when joining a game to only have players with a similar rating. The last game like this I played was Unreal Tournament 2003 and that had a form of ability based matchmaking or at least different levels of ability in games. Epic did that then so why not now?

Here's why:","The way Epic has gone about balancing their weapons is creating very distinct early, mid, and late game tiers of weapons. This formula can be applied to just about every weapon type. 

Snipers: Semi - Bolt - Heavy

AR's - Normal AR's - Suppressed Scars - Scars

SMG's - Normal SMG - P90

Explosive - Grenades - Grenade launcher - RPG

This formula, is the what Epic has seem to be sticking too with their weapon balance. And it apparent in every patch. For example, the bolt being dropped town a tier and the Semi two tiers. This creates a very distinct weapon tier hierarchy.  

However with the shotguns, it gets a little convoluted. And it's apparent to me that the pump should be removed from the game because it is one of the few weapons that A: Breaks the formula and B: Resembles another shotgun so closely, it shouldn't exist period. 

Currently the list is as follows. 

Shotguns - Tac - Pump - Heavy - Double Barrel. 

Both the heavy and double barrel spawn in the same rarity despite it being very obvious which is the better choice for late game. And the heavy is basically a more effective, more rare pump. The solution? Vault the pump, and drop the heavy down a rarity, increasing it's drop rate slightly. 

Now you have a more distinct list, and the heavy turns into the automatic pump replacement. Which should've happened a long time ago. 

Shotguns - Tac, Heavy, Pump. 3 tiers, 3 different uses, 3 distinct play styles. ",FortNiteBR

They know people will buy it, and that they will make bank off of it. They just have no idea the repercussions which will come. The T-pose will become a cringe meme, as did the dab, orange justice, default dance, milky rock, shoot, and so forth. 

The T-pose is iconic in the meme community, and should stay that way. It is used in practical sense like planking, being done in random places for shitposts, or used, while cringy in itself, to “assert dominance”. Fortnite making the T-pose an emote guarantees it’s death. Though T-posing to assert dominance was always cringy, it was in a good way, due to you needing slight understanding of what irony is and whatnot. I know this to be true due to telling my friends to T-pose and seeing them with no idea to what it is. Now, the T-pose will die. Cringy 7 year olds will start T-posing to assert dominance and once that starts, just like with the shoot, orange justice, and Fortnite as a whole, it will die. 

I guess I made this to say goodbye to the T-pose, it was good while it lasted. It was something funny to do and get that sense of satisfaction when you see someone look at you and nod their head, knowing what’s up. Or doing it and seeing someone else do it with you.

This is usual, but this time it had sparked a thought. Why not vault double barrel and bring back double pump to restore the game's meta for a little because quite frankly I'm just as tired with SMGs. The pump damage can stay the same because if you have two, who cares as long as you're accurate? The way I see it is that it is a simple fix that can replace the double barrel for something that actually requires skill and doesn't make me want to break my computer.  After all, I'd much rather die to skill than to someone who just started playing yesterday because they barrel stuff me.",FortNiteBR

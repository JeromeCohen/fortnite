My ways to fix it:
1. Add pump tac again, its a good meta and needs skill, not the fucking luck created by number generator.
2.  I feel like I talk by everyone when I say whomever that thought that turrets are fun is dumb.
3. Explosives are a delicate situation so I won't get into it so much.
4. Glider redeploy and the bouncers where amazing and added aggressiveness to the game, BRING THEM THE FUCK BACK
5. STOP THINKING THAT BAD PEOPLE NEED TO BE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS OTHER PEOPLE, I get that they will get destroyed by us players that are good. But if they really like the game, then destroying them will just make them competitive and push them to become better. If they give up is because they are a bunch of pussies and they don't want to get better.

That's it, have a good day.

¬∑ Nerf the body shot damage to 20 or 25.

¬∑ Reduce the floor underneath's damage by 50%.

¬∑ Somehow FIX the user's hitbox. In fact, make you MORE vulnerable when using it. For instance, expose the character model's head entirely, but not their body.

¬∑ Reduce the drop rate to the same (or less) than Launch Pads,

Let me know what you think about these changes. Only want to make these changes because I think a mounted turret was a good idea from Epic, just clearly not executed right.

It is so much fun when an enemy is shooting at me with it! I really enjoy being able to counter this item. Here are my top 10 reasons for why I adore it: 
 

1. 40/80 damage. 
2. No damage drop-off
3. Fast fire rate
4. High drop rate (still)
5. Considerable damage to structures 
6. Essentially indestructible
7. Unlimited ammo
8. Fast cool-down
9. Barely any angles available to damage the firing player. 
10. Console aim assist locks onto the turret, not the player.

Can we get a nerf to building anytime soon Epic?  The attacker here left his tactically advantagous position to steamroll me with zero consequence.  I mean, what else am I to do?

I could have built, but I don't think all engagements between highly skilled players should end in a build fight.

The way that fortnite is right now is unplayable, and I'm actually thinking of paying money for another game, Like they say all good things come to an end. The whole community right now is not pleased, all these content creators are for sure, not happy with the current patch and all these other people making threads on Twitter, telling epic what to add and vault/fix is making things a little better for epic games to see, that their game is at a shit point. In conclusion, fortnite was fun while it lasted I think epic games needs to do something quickly, this went from the worlds best game (in my eyes and others) to complete shit, but we all don't get all ways and that's fine.

The skins would work like the other sports skins- you could buy each gender/race in the shop, and then also customize them.

There would be two ways to customize the skins. You could select a drum major uniform, a regular uniform, and a uniform with a beret (sometimes worn by sousaphone players). You would also be able to select a primary and secondary color for the uniform.

The pickaxe could be a drum major mace, and there could maybe be an emote for all the instruments (but that's probably asking a bit too much...)

Last weeks patch-6.22 introduced the heavy ar

The week before that-6.21 added balloons

And finally 6.20 added Fortnitemares.

Epic what happened the the proposed system of content then bug fixes?

Next point, some of the recent changes are just changes but for what reason? Why were balloons added? Why was the tactical Smg vaulted and the regular smg added in? Did anyone ask for chillers? And a big one-Why the fuck is there a turret you can spray for years on end and the only downside is a short ass cooldown time? The turret has many issues, besides being overpowered, but having a shit hitbox, crazy damage, no damage falloff, and what else, oh yes ITS SPAWN RATE IS INSANE.

Ehem, scuse me, next point.

Wasnt there supposed to be a 2nd shooting test happening? Where did it go? And why was it just swept under the floors.

You need to get your shit together Epic Games, Nothing will kill Fortnite but time, you will just make your time, much shorter.

TL;DR: Epic Games needs to be more transparent, they need to ask the community about what they feel should be added or not. They should atleast test the stuff they add. Whatever happened to shooting test #2? I don't really like the system we have right now still, but Epic seems pretty happy apparently. Just basically Epic needs to be Epic again.

The Victory Umbrellas, as cool as they are you can't really flex on all the noobs. That is where I got this idea:

Get a 10 kill win, get a certain back bling such as this purple shield.

Then 15 kill win get a silver one.

Then 20 you get a gold one.

I think it could be cool as the players are now able to show off the high kill gameplays as well as they will be rarer and you can flex.

So when I linked my EpicGames account to the phone, I played three FULL matches (didn't win obviously, I'm bad without my PS4 controller lol). My dads kind of a 'addicted to phone' man so I had to remove the game because he needs his Candy Crush and the million other Angry Bird games lol. I emailed Epicgames WHEN to expect the Galaxy. They gave me a nice response. I just had to wait. HOWEVER I didn't get it. When I emailed them AGAIN, they said exactly thisL

Thank you for contacting us for your issue.  


Thank you for your interest in Fortnite and the new Galaxy skin.  


Unfortunately, the device that is connected to your account does not meet the eligibility requirements for the Galaxy skin. Currently, only Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and Galaxy Tab S4 device owners are eligible to receive the Galaxy skin.  


I apologize for any inconvenience.  


Thank you for your patience and understanding.

What do I have to do now? I can't download Fortnite AGAIN on my dad's phone because he was kinda mad and not understanding about the whole Galaxy skin campaign. But what do I have to do now? I sent them a mail again about 12 hours ago and still haven't received an answer. Can I get somebody's help? Did somebody have a similar problem like mine? Thanks in advance.

Slowly but surely the management of this game has gone down questionable avenues. I‚Äôve joked about it many times but now it‚Äôs actually a reality - I‚Äôm uninstalling this game. The constant game-breaking bugs, performance issues, and the biggest thing is a general lack of fun anymore. 

It‚Äôs not fun getting spammed by a quadlauncher while their teammates walk into your builds. It‚Äôs not fun being spammed by turrets you can‚Äôt hit people out of. It‚Äôs not fun having to bloom battle potatoes because your bullets don‚Äôt feel like hitting. It‚Äôs not fun to farm for 10 minutes each game to make it to end circle with enough mats to fight off splodes. 

I know one player doesn‚Äôt matter, I just thought I‚Äôd share my opinion to make it easier for anyone else who feels similar. I have had a tough time contemplating this decision because I haven‚Äôt really been great at many games. But I loved this one. As a decent player I find the game much more demanding now than it used to be. I couldn‚Äôt imagine being a ‚Äúcasual‚Äù at this point.

mine was the old race track and the gass station above the prison.

because when i was a noob back in s2 (when the map update came) i clutched solo v squads (with 3 killed freinds that were spectating me) at the gass station.

i was camping in a the house that was there and i put down a trap and 2 guys walked in it and were downed. and dead.

then another guy walked into the trap and he also got knocked and dead.

all my freinds went insane because i as a noob did this stuff and they were good players.

and then it was a 1v1.

i went yolo outside the house and went into an insane shotgun fight.

then i killed the guy and litterly the one thing you heard was: \*screaming\* OMG YOURE A FK LEGEND BROOO

And i thought id give my honest opinion on the matter. People scream to quickly without looking at the pros and cons, so epic quickly responds by removing it quick after it got added.

&amp;#x200B;

**So in my opinion the MOST anoying things to die by in this game is:**

1. *storm (land junk, have to go all the way to paradise).*
2. *falling (not being able to build, or getting 3rd partied outof build-fight)*
3. *slow gameplay, not finding players (looking for 5minutes b4 finding players unless you're lucky or go tilted)*

Glider re-deploy fixes ALL of these things!

Not only can you now build up and glide away as if you had a launchpad, thus not getting hit by storm (or not as hard). You can glide whenever falling down from a build fight so that the 3rd party doesnt just get kills for being a d\*ck, plus you're not outof the game just yet (you're very vulnerable in the sky so not op imo). And if you can't find anyone, just build UP, look around, glide around etc, you can keep fighting or at least getting closer to fights than b4. Plus if you get pinched by 3 teams you can just try and fly away.

So if you look at it like that, glider re-deploy is absolutely PERFECT, fixes so many stupid issues. Great adition.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now, lets look at the cons of re-deploy (or rather what i see as the cons):**

1. *people can run away, if they're low or just if they're scared to fight or are mid fight and losing.*
2. *can possibly get pinched even more bc several teams can just build up and glide towards the sound of bullets.*

Now i gotta admit, the first point is anoying for sure. You're outplaying a guy to the max, you're better at building, hit em real hard and they just glide away. Lets say you're in titled, now he glides behind a building and hides, aka you dont get the kill 90% of the time. Too bad. 

The reason i say in tilted is because if they were to glide away lets say in leaky, the dont have that much clutter to hind behind, they can go behind a rock but if you have eyes you can see them going to a rock and can see him moving from that rock. In other words, only in places like tilted (and prob PP and RR) will this be anoying.

Now getting pinched by teams. Anoying? Yes. Impossible to win in that situation? Unless they have splodes/p90 or are way better, no. You can def have bad luck or get focused completely by 3 teams and die unfairly, but that doesnt happen too often, and if it does happen, it wouldve happened without glider re-deploy too (bc without glider re-deploy you got focused and pinched too).

&amp;#x200B;

**For these reason my conclusion is (TL/DR also):**

Glider re-deploy is a almost perfect adition to the game, it has flaws, but the pros outway the cons HEAVILY. with re-deploy all the anoying things about this game, wich cant be fixed by nerfing or buffing guns/building, are gone. Not only that but the cons now are so insignificant because they are minor things. Not gamebreaking or unfair.

Thus i feel that glider re-deploy should be reconsidered. Dont scream or get mad, just think about the pro's and cons.

Id love to hear what you guys think, do you agree or do you see it differently?

Scaling is set on GPU. I tried deleting the game setting.ini file and launching the game again. It‚Äôs fine when on windowed fullscreen but fullscreen screws it up. 

Can anyone help me?

I have linked a picture an video on how it looks on windowed fullscreen and on fullscreen..

Thanks!

But I'm going to keep trying to get this noticed, this is a big issue with the Switch and I believe in the platform.

Since Tournament have been introduced. The Switch has been throwing players into cross play lobbies by default. This means going into duos or squads, when NOT cross playing with friends. You get put against PS4 and Xbox Players. I'm sorry, but the Switch port is not good. It lags, it hitches it runs at 20-30FPS. But it's playable against other Switch players. It's just completely unfair to put us against PS4 and Xbox Players. It's like pairing them with PC players. 

Its really sucked the fun out of the game. Cross play lobbies are really laggy on Switch. People hitch around, and meanwhile they make easy work of you because they are not lagging.

Please can we get Epic to see this? I've been trying for almost a month. Making reports in game, posting on Twitter, posting on Reddit. It seems the only way to get noticed is by persistence.",FortNiteBR

The main loadout has been the same for the past 2 seasons and personally im getting quite bored of it..
It would be great to see double pump to add more variety to the game.
Obviously people would say that its too op and it shouldn't be in the game but my idea is to not allow any otheer shotguns with the heavy or double barrel.
This would mean if you want to use a good shotgun you will have to use an smg with it. also you could maybe even buff the smgs if you think its still not good enough.
I personally think that if double pump comes back it won't be the best loadout since shotguns cant rip through structures like the smg does.. plus as i said you can only use double shotgun with pump and tacs and for heavy and double barrel you would have to use an smg.

Anyways the least i would like to see next season is pump tac.

I thought they took away double pump and made consistent damage, but now there‚Äôs neither and it‚Äôs ruining the pump as a whole. I don‚Äôt know if this is caused by ping lag or if they legitimately just made the pump completely useless.

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong though, and it‚Äôs just a lag problem, but I highly doubt it considering I get below 60 ping in most cases. They need to add the randomized damage back at least, so even if I get 6 damage sometimes, I still have a chance of 225.

If you disagree with me, ok then, but these my opinions. That being said, I'm willing to have a discussion and to have my mind changed on any of these aspects. So, I've been playing fortnite since September of last year, and I've seen every single meta come and go. As of today, I have 6,149 matches played, and countless hours (around 6 weeks if you make every match around 10 mins long, the in-between of dying off spawn and winning) spent learning this game. I have evolved with this game, hence this post. This game is very near and dear to my heart and I'd hate to see it become so boring. I'm not alone in this, as there are countless top-tier players and streamers who agree. So just to list some things off, these are the most irritating aspects of the game:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Bloom

\- Rpg/Splodes

\- TURRETS

\- Shotgun damage

\- Overall pace

&amp;#x200B;

So I'll break down my reasoning for each point so that this can be discussed and argued. So the first aspect... Bloom. That's a yikes for me. I understand that this is a game and it isn't real life but id just like to put a scenario out there. If I were to shoot a gun, where would the bullet go? It'd go in a straight and predictable line. Now, let's think for a second about the cons of it in fortnite. Hipfiring from mid-range would be slightly unbalanced, but that's what buildings for. To create cover so that we don't take damage. This would replace bloom battles with aim battles, a much more pleasant experience. I personally wouldn't be mad if a player was just better then me, but when my bullets don't go where I'm aiming, that's when this game becomes tilting. Of course, no one has **perfect** aim, but bloom has caused more missed shots that should've hit then hit shots that I should've missed. Guns such as AR's, Deagles, Hunting Rifles, and pistols should have no bloom, but guns with fire rates that are similar to the p90s or other smgs should have bloom. Spraying isn't skill based, so neither should hitting shots with those guns be.

&amp;#x200B;

Explosives can **sometimes** be a double-edged sword, but weapons like the RPG and the quad-launcher have too much reward and not enough risk. I understand that these are epic and legendary tier weapons, but they spawn way too often. I haven't been in a top 10 situation where there isn't someone with splodes, and I'll admit, I'm usually one of those in the top 10 but how could I not? RPGs can be found in chests, supply drops, and vending machines. They eliminate the skill gap and make killing other players way too easy. I feel especially bad for those who don't quite have the best building. In one of the skirmishes, Cloakzy and his partner managed to rack 13 kills (if I remember correctly), which as a ridiculous amount of kills for two people. I mean its amazing that they managed to accomplish such a feat, and I'm not in anyway shape or form hating on him, but there was no real skill involved in those kills. I feel bad for the other pros on the receiving end of the rockets. In an instant, they were stripped of shield and were put down almost immediately. They were both pros,  but one won because he had a better gun, not because he was smart or better at the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Holy crap. Turrets. What the actual fuck was epic thinking. Not only is it damn near impossible to hit someone off of them, but they also had the audacity to give them 40 damage per shot and infinite ammo. I think that the minigun is stupid, but it still has its cons. It reduces your mobility and makes you vulnerable to being sniped. There is a tiny spot of a players head that is exposed that you have to hit because the turrets also melt through builds. You really can't outbuild a turret and the fact that it does 80 damage as a headshot is actually ridiculous. It's honestly better than an AK. Its bloom size is way too small and it does way too much damage. The minigun has fall off damage and does 27 damage at a range with a headshot, but 80 with no fall off? That's ridiculous. If epic deemed the drum gun to be too op and vaulted it, this needs to go now. It spawns way too frequently too. I've had at least 5 turrets in all the games that I've won today.

&amp;#x200B;

Pump damage. This one needs to be fixed. I can agree that if I hit someone's pinky toe with one pellet that it should do as much as a chest shot, but their registry system needs to be fixed. I have a prime example of why it's not working as its supposed too. I'll set the scene. I was in retail, no mats, low hp, so I boxed myself in. The player that you see in the image attached replaced my wall and went for the edit. I used ADS with my pump and traced his head through the freshly built wall. As he edited the wall, I got the shot that I wanted... but for a 17 damage headshot. Take a look for yourself. Does that look like a 17 damage headshot to you? Look at where the pellets hit. It's stupid. They need a new registry system for shotgun pellets.

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly is the pace. They kept Glider Redeploy in for too long. Players, including myself and other pros agree that it helped late-game rotation, but with the test period concluding, the game feels so slow. I don't find people, I die to storm more than I have ever before, and with the increasingly shorter amount of time given to rotate, it doesn't create an enjoyable setting. I do enjoy knocking down stupid players who think that they're good because they play more playgrounds then actual games. I can't say whether I liked fortnight more with or without redeploy. They have they're pros and cons but I can respect the decision that epic made on this. I felt bored playing today. I enjoy this game a lot, and yes, there are some tilting moments, but i love this game. That being said, I don't feel like I'm having fun while playing. The constant addition of new items doesn't help either. I've only bored of this game twice. The first time being the addition of Fortnitemares and the turret update. These are just my thoughts on the state of the game. Feel free to try and change my mind

Nothing else except for spending money for skins which aren‚Äôt even that important, it‚Äôs a P2W game, and nobody likes it.

Because we don‚Äôt like it? There are actually good players on IOS and Switch, and I hate how they are influencing the more popular consoles, sure Pok√©mon let‚Äôs go made the switch more popular, but the other devices, (PS4 and XBOX, PC)  get better stuff? And we get a bundle? Why would we spend 300 on a switch bundle, if you can‚Äôt even do anything with it? Alright I‚Äôm done, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm pissed about how we can‚Äôt get anything, while the others get more stuff and we get less and less.

I think the game would be better off if you started with a weak weapon at the start of the game, probably a common pistol.

Start game - Massive problem, even at a 400 health pool, that‚Äôs 14 AR bullets or 10 for a heavy AR in which you have ~40-60 ammo, bloom on this game and building all taken into consideration, 10 bullets just to destroy a turret is way too much. You can counter it with grenades if you‚Äôve got a good angle to throw it and they need to be somewhat boxed in for this to work. If you have splodes you might be okay. Now they deal 40 damage a piece, you‚Äôve mined up ~100 mats which is 10 walls, one wall dies in 2-3 shots and then your turbo built walls die in 1, your mats have disappeared in seconds and natural cover is very rarely an option. They can melt through houses or whatever other buildings might exist in the area you‚Äôre in and there is no penalty to them, but if they‚Äôre bots they can die to a headshot from a sniper because they didn‚Äôt cover all bases, but I play console of which there‚Äôs barely any bots, everyone on the game nowadays is half decent so...

Mid game - Not too much of a problem seen here as you‚Äôre in open space, they can be a hassle but for the most part they aren‚Äôt a problem, but that being said you will watch your 999 stack of wood drop to 359 within seconds all so you can not take the inevitable 40 damage.

End game - The worst part and where turrets shine the most. Me and a friend got into the zone, can‚Äôt remember which one but it was half into the storm so a late one. We both put down turrets and just both lasered down a team of 2 fighting their way towards us. Now you may claim that ‚Äòwell you just had better zone position so they were just bad‚Äô which is wrong. They could‚Äôve entered the zone earlier yes but at the end of the day they wasted so many materials just simply trying to get us because there is absolutely no drawback to these turrets, no cheeky snipes would‚Äôve done anything and they can‚Äôt stop for a second to catch their breath, it‚Äôs just constant holding down r2 until enough bullets of ours did 40 damage for the kill.

In conclusion, there are 2 possible ways to fix these that I can think of. 

1. Vault them. 

2. Make them take heavy ammo, it‚Äôll add a use for the hundred or so heavy ammo you manage to rack up over the game and means at start game you‚Äôll have 7-14 shots at most in your average game.

3. Vault them.

I like option 1 and 3 the most, but that‚Äôs just me. I saved the clip of me and my friend just mowing down the 2 guys (which I didn‚Äôt want to do other than to just prove a point) and will post it if anyone wants to see. ",FortNiteBR

Some examples are:

\-Mouth movement when speaking in lobby

\-New colors for team mates

\-Turrets

\-Ability to emote while frozen by freezer trap

\-Broken new UI's

Epic, we're thankful you're trying to make changes however please focus on fixing the actual important stuff in the game. We are all sick of you guys wasting your time adding this stuff when you could be fixing all the 100's of glitches in the game.

I know I am probably going to get heavily downvoted for this, but this is the truth.

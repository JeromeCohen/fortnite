When I was younger, playing split screen was sometimes annoying because you could screen peek. We knew that was the risk when wanting to play together on one screen. If we didn't like it, we wouldn't play.

Now, people play with their own screens but decide to broadcast it to the world for their gain (fame, money). They know the risks involved. It's a trade off. ",FortNiteBR

We're all just bad at aiming! The way shotguns work is they crosshair fires pellets that when hit a  target from a certain distance, do a certain amount of damage. So for all those people hitting shots under 10 damage, it's not the shotguns fault. You're either too far or you only hit 1 or 2 pellets.

So, going by this logic, the more pellets from a closer range you hit, the more damage you do. This makes sense.

But if everytime you hit someone you hit them for at least 3 pellets, shotguns are gonna start to shread people.

I'm calling it now folks, the tacs will become one of the most OP guns in the next update. You will be killing people with shotguns faster and getting killed faster. You will all complain.

Out of regret for not spending my 7500 vbucks on the remaining 35 tiers of the s2 battle pass and instead on Brite bomber, I thought of this idea. After finishing the current 100 tiers you should be able to go back to the previous PURCHASED battle pass that has yet to be completed. Emphasis on purchased as someone who was never around for an older season or never decided to purchase that battle pass should not be able to go back and try to complete it, as it would ruin the purpose of the ‚Äúseasonal‚Äù system. When you do decide to finish the battlepass you must first finish the most recent seasonal battle pass. For example if I were to try to complete the season 3 battle pass but the season 4 battlepass is incomplete, then I must finish the season 4 battle pass first. This would be Perfect as this would keep balance between ""OG"" players and newer players because you would have had to be there for the season, have purchased the battle pass, and complete the seasonal battle passes after it. I think many people would agree with me as Fortnite became wildly popular mid season 2, when even if the pass was purchased, there was not enough available time to complete it.  Anyways, Hopefully this was explained well enough as this can seriously be a considered topic throughout the community. I would love to finally reach the black knight after only making it to the Axecalibur and sir glider the brave! Thanks for considering!

We also have to mention that the double barrel if your close enough will 1-shot a 100 health player. 

These weapons are completely no-skill

These weapons are the reason why less skilled players get almost no wins compared to a bit more average player, these players get shredded by shotguns!

Removing shotguns may allow players with less skill to get more wins which intern will keep players playing.

Don't downvote this post because you are a tryhard who worships shotguns and there combos for extreme amounts of kills, you know you're having issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Glider redeploy is gone meaning build fights are risky enough, (Which i understand was changed because the community was divided on the change) now you're adding even more explosives to the game to prevent people from build-fighting more?

Here's a list of the current explosives we have. (We need less of these)

 ‚Ä¢ Grenades

 ‚Ä¢ Clingers

 ‚Ä¢ RPG

 ‚Ä¢ Quad Launcher

 ‚Ä¢ Grenade Launcher

 ‚Ä¢ Dynamite

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this, as a lot of you guys may know epic has announced they're going to test new things through the new ""Scavenger Pop up cup"".

Here's some of the notes for those who haven't read it.

* Material cap reduced from 500 to 300.
* Drop count of Clingers and Grenades increased from 3 to 5.

Updates have gone from fun new guns, to peoples favorites being vaulted.

&amp;#x200B;

 ‚Ä¢ Chillers - Should be replaced with bouncers.

 ‚Ä¢ Turrets - Broken and have to go (In my opinion)

 ‚Ä¢ Balloons - Partial mobility, but not worth an inventory slot

 

The Latest dynamite update seems like it wasn't thought out whatsoever and was just placed in for content.

&amp;#x200B;

The game is going in a really weird direction and i hope you guys realize that soon enough.

I know a lot of you guys are going to agree and disagree, I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts.

The turret has just been added and there's no proper balance for it still. Most of the newer items/vehicles (balloons/quad) are completely unnecessary in my opinion, it just clutters the game with no real reason and kills the whole meta.

I get that the weekly items are here to keep the game fresh, but what it really does is making the game more and more boring, as there's no excitement for new items anymore, it just becomes normal. Not mentioning that some of the decisions are really questionable (e.g Are the balloons really needed in the game ? Does the turret really have its place in the game other than in the Food Fight LTM ?).

Epic really needs to find another game to keep the game cool and fresh rather than feeling forced of throwing random guns and vehicles. Why not doing a huge UI revamp like STW had ? Making short in-game events, for a week every month for example ? That's the kind of thing that keeps the community interested in the game, rather than throwing a new gun that everybody tested in the next 24 hours after the patch.

There's just so many potential in this game that isn't exploited because Epic is choosing the easy way by cluttering the game with items that aren't even that useful, yet potentially game-changing.

An idea on how this could work is to searching for a match based on K/D. So let's say a player has a 1.2 kd. When hes hit that play button, fortnite should search for players with a kd between 1 and 1.5 and match them into the same game. If enough players haven't been found in, say, 30 secs, it then expands its search. It is would make the game waaaaay less frustrating for new players, as they wont just get rekt by sweaty tryhards every time. It will also make the game way more competitive for the good players. Idk if this idea has been brought up before but I think it would greatly help the health of the game. I also have no idea how complicated it would be for epic to implement or not.

For squads/duos it could just average out the kd of each team.",FortNiteBR

If you were a new or low skill player in seasons 1, 2, and some of 3, you had a much better chance at winning or seeing success compared to today.

So my question to you is, do you think the skill gap is becoming an issue, and if so, what do you think Epic should do about it?

 Battle Royale has players that are better at gun play than building, and players that are better at building than gun play. How about implementing a squad game mode using four ""specialists"" that have preset skins, not custom and same goes for gliders,  and unique enhanced areas of play. it would seem more of a tactical squad mode, and would require more caution, more thinking and communication, and would bring a new element of fun over the game. And of course, keeping the existing Squad mode, for more casual play, but having this added to the game mode playlist. For example of players in the game mode,

&amp;#x200B;

Architect (Placeholder name) - Fast and accurate building, easy to gather materials. Nerfed aiming and gun play.

&amp;#x200B;

Assaulter - Enhanced accuracy with small and mid-range weapons (Assault rifle, subs, etc) Weapons that are not in this category are not changed in performance, nerfed building and gather of materials

&amp;#x200B;

Eugene (IDK a name for this character but it fits LMAO) - all rounder, no areas enhanced, just like  player found in typical matches

&amp;#x200B;

Brute - Excelling in use of heavy weapons, but nerfed use of all other weapons and building. 

&amp;#x200B;

The names are kinda corny, and this just popped into my head, so let me know your thoughts and discussion, who knows maybe one day we will see something like this!

Cheers.

The fact that such a ridiculous patch was able to remain for this long just baffles me, and I've honestly lost most of my respect for the Epic team.

I am quite mad at this since I really wanted to give this out to the community but whatever. So the following is literally about a week old.

So around the 9th of this month (November) I have found a dragon flying above Tomato Temple (I think it was the 9th since my Nintendo Switch says that on its folder date). I believe I have actually seen this dragon before either at the end of season 5 or the beginning of season 6, although unconfirmed and may just be a false memory (but I truly do believe so). I also believe I saw it before in salty springs or something (around the right side of the map) but it might be Tomato Temple at that same time.

I initially took some screenshots to share with my friends later on but my cousin asked if I shared it with anyone but then I got the idea of sharing it with the community since I could not find any videos or evidence that anyone has found this before. I was on a trip so I waited till I got home but forgot. BUT I had just remembered on doing this so I got excited and copied the files from my Nintendo Switch's SD card to my computer.

I hid my name on these photos just in case but you can enjoy these screenshots of me looking at the dragon and using my thermal-scoped assault rifle to zoom in more. I did shoot at it initially because I thought it was a paraglider or something that a player was using but didn't take any damage (I shot it three times to make sure that it wasn't a player). Also, it was flying around in small circles so that might help with it.

BTW, you may not trust me since I had just made this Reddit account but I did have another one initially (to talk about some squeaking noises my switch was making, although it's gone now). I forgot the username and email to that but just trust me on this. I mean I put some effort into this and I don't want people to think it's fake just because I made a new account or just for attention.

Thank you for your time and for any further adieu, here's the screenshots I promised:

&amp;#x200B;

[ Here's me with my scoped-assault rifle taking a closer inspection \(after I shot at it three times\).](https://i.redd.it/g8stqqn2aez11.jpg)

Right now I am not sure what this is about but it seems that season 7 is maybe going to happen around tomato temple. I have many questions about this too but I want to see what everyone thinks about this. What could this mean?",FortNiteBR

With 4 other people left I killed 3 of them, and ended up losing to the dude who was camping on the mountain. 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only would the additional mats be helpful for a situation like mine, but it also would help discourage third-partying. With the +50 health /shield boost I believe Epic is trying to discourage third-partying, which is amazing. However, if a player just wasted their mats on the last guy they fought, what good does +50 health/shield *really* do in a top 10 scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

Would this be a worthwhile addition for Scavenger Cup and maybe even official Solo's in the future?",FortNiteBR

It's hard for the low skill players where you can get buildspammed and outplayed by lots of players, and too easy for the high skill players where they can buildspam and win fights easily. Epic has tried to make the game easier for low skill players with the SMG buffs in late s4 and 5, and the turret although high skill players can utilize them just as well. If Epic wants the game to last, they can add SBMM in, where low skill players get matched with other low skill players, get better and move on up against higher skill players with the matchmaking adjusting to determine a player's matchmaking rank. High skill players will be matched with other high skill players, where the game will become challenging for them. If Epic wants the game to become as competitive as CSGO or Overwatch, then they will need SBMM",FortNiteBR

I feel like if they combined this mode with blitz as it we perfect, people won‚Äôt have time to sit around peaking through cones and will actually try and end fights quickly.

Some people grinded really hard to earn their max Omega, but not everyone had the same amount of time to put on the game. Some people who paid for the season 4 battle pass weren‚Äôt able to unlock everything they paid for, but at the same time it would be unfair to just give it to them for the people who took their time to grind season 4.

What I am suggesting is to put the same challenges back, but making it that it works for any season instead of just season 4. It means that people would still have to grind as much as the people who unlocked theirs during season 4, but they could do it at a season when they know they have the time to do it.

I would also suggest epic to add a style colour that was exclusive to the unlocking during season 4 so that doing it during the season it came out gives an advantage.

&amp;#x200B;

That dang wave emote.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of all the things I regret in my life, the second being my own birth, the one I regret the most is missing out on that freaking wave emote. It's the culmination of all situational emotes wrapped up in one beautiful animation. It can be used in LITERALLY any moment you can think of. Do you want to BM someone? Wave at them. Want to thank a teammate for reviving you? Wave. Want to tell an enemy player that you're friendly and you want to pursue some delinquent shenanigans with them? Smile and wave, boys.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of all that, it's quite literally the friendliest interaction you can have with another player. All the other emotes just don't quite fit the bill, and I feel like a monster for not having the physical capabilities of moving my arm back and forth like some of you do. It's like watching your dear old grandmother bake you a delicious apple pie with extra cinnamon, and she even arranged the dough to form a giant heart in the middle because she loves you so much, but unfortunately for you, you got involved in a freak accident last night that left you unable to speak with two broken arms, so you eat the pie without showing any form of appreciation. I try to react to another player's wave the best I can, but no amount of Jubilation, Twist, or Disco Fever can ever replicate the simple and heartwarming feeling of waving back.

&amp;#x200B;

Being able to wave at people is like parting the stormy clouds and forming a rainbow for everyone in the vicinity to witness. I wish I had this kind of power, but I can only fulfill my dream through other games like Overwatch. I literally have my side mouse button bound to ""Hello"", which is right next to my shoot button. If any game like this offers a way to spam my positivity at other players, you can bet your keister I'm gonna use it more often than the beat of my own heart.

&amp;#x200B;

I know I'll never have the opportunity to bring the emote back. I know I can't go back in time and force my younger self to stop doing stupid things like college homework and play more fortnite, but, heck dude, if there was one item I'd give my left arm for, it would be that stinkin' wave emote.

&amp;#x200B;

So for those of you who DO own the wave emote, I hope you understand the awesome power that you have to bring smiles to other player's faces. When I default dance back at you, it's not because I'm taunting at you or think I'm better than you, it's simply because I didn't install this game sooner than you and I missed out on the greatest opportunity of my life. But because you seized that opportunity, you can do whatever your heart and mind desires. In the famous words of Thomas Jefferson, ""Nothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man who didn't install Fortnite during season 2 and missed out on the wave emote like a freaking idiot.""

&amp;#x200B;

Keep being awesome guys.",FortNiteBR

2. Hunting Party Challenges, I finished 8 weeks and got the A.I.M skin and wanted to know if I finish all 10 weeks do I unlock anything else?

Reduces the RNG aspect of looking for shields on dead bodies 

(What‚Äôs worse than killing 5 people in a row, and none of the kids you killed have shields or even bandages for that matter? It happens. You‚Äôre limping around the map at 37 health while little Tommy with zero kills is at a full 200). 

2.) Incentivizes aggression and speeds up the pace of the game.

(You play a bit more aggressive knowing you‚Äôll get Health Regen from a kill). 

3.) Makes finishing a kill on a turtling player less annoying 

(Sometimes to finish off a player with low HP you have to put yourself in a position to take a little damage). 

And probably the best part.. 

4.) Mitigates the effectiveness of players 3rd partying!! 

(Nothing is more annoying than someone trying to clean you up while you‚Äôre 20 HP from your last fight. With 50 HP Health Regen, it keeps the 3rd party-er honest). 

I‚Äôm not to sure what I think about the Scavenger pop-up Cup as a whole, but the Health-Regen in that mode makes me play it every time. I think the community would grow to love it if it was in the base game.

With all the new items, and especially the re-deploy glider, you can move from one side of the map to the other extremely quick, resulting in more 3rd-partying. 
With the removal of the re-deploy glider the 3rd-partying have been reduced.
But as the average player have become better at bulding we meet a lot more ""bob the builders""(BBs for short, pronounced same as babies), whos only goal is to build as high as possible without engaging in any gun fight. This makes the game alot less enjoyable for a ""Low Ground Loser"" (""LGL"" for short) as myself.

How would you react to a item or weapon that would be extremely effective against walls and building-structures? This item would of course only be very close range, maybe even only limited to touching the objects, and could probably be limited to only damaging non-players for balancing purposes.

My favourite aspect of the multitude of items and weapons in this game is that you can choose what items you use based on your play style. By implementing an item as described you would get a much more diverse experience, and not only tall 1x1 towers spread across the map.
Thanks for your time, and im looking forward to hearing your reactions to this suggestion.

Every time we used to get on together we'd usually win 3-6 matches and have a lot of fun.

Well we get on today and the first match we get into is a scrims match with 30 people in the last circle. 

The next match, I'm not sure if it was a scrim or not but it started looking like one for sure, we died too early for me to really tell but it was definitely a ton of extremely high level players. 

We played about 3 more matches after that, and they all seemed to be normal matches, but our morale was a bit down by that point and we spent the rest of the night playing food fight ltm. 

All my friends have quit playing, except for the rare occasion they get back on to play with me. 
I'm the only one out of the 10 or so people I knew that played that still plays consistently. 

It's just not fun anymore and when I do get someone on and they get thrown into a match with nothing but near pro level players, it feels terrible. 

I'm not a bad player, and I'm the only one out of everyone I knew that decided to keep playing and grinding to get as good at building and up on the meta as possible, but it feels like it's not rewarding anymore. Back when I started, knowing building tricks was an advantage, but now it feels like if you make a single mistake you're dead. 

Not having a competitive mode or private servers means scrims are happening on public servers, and casual players aren't having a good time anymore.

Personally I can handle that and adapt and try to improve against these guys, but my casual friends that want to play to have fun won't, and not having people to play with is going to be what kills the game for me.

Current green Pump:

1 Bullet - Damage 8 ///
2 Bullets - Damage 16 ///
3 Bullets - Damage 24 ///
4 Bullets - Damage 32 ///
5 Bullets - Damage 40 ///
6 Bullets - Damage 48 ///
7 Bullets - Damage 56 ///
8 Bullets - Damage 64 ///
9 Bullets - Damage 72 ///
10 Bullets - Damage 80 ///

If any of these bullets hit the headshot hitbox (even 1/10 that hit) it gets multiplied by 2x right now.

My change would be having minimum damage that is higher than right now so its worth shooting with a shotgun in a fight.

New green Pump:

1-3 Bullet - Damage 24 /// 
4-6 Bullets - Damage 48 ///
7-9 Bullets - Damage 72 ///
10 Bullets - Damage 80 ///

The same applies to headshot damage. If only 1/10 bullets that actually hit, hit the headshot hitbox it gets multiplied by 2x. That means if i hit my enemy with 5 bullets and 1 of these 5 hit the head, i get a complete damage of 96. That should make them feel consistent for the first time. And this change would make especially tactical shotguns and the new double barrel consistent. Since both struggle with consistency. 

Damage drop off on all shotguns is a whole new story, but i would love to see how this would feel. 

Btw I‚Äôm a console player since the beginning and have never used double pump. Just in case somebody is wondering.

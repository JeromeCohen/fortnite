In my opinion to fix the game you’ll need to introduce a few new concepts. First of all you should introduce a free for all gamemode just like they have in black ops 2. And maybe put in kill streaks into the game so players earn rewards. Another cool concept would be a zombies mode where players fight against zombies to survive as long as they can just like in the modern warfares video games. 


Anyways that’s my ideas for how to fix your game. Please share feedback below. ",FortNiteBR

You can get a 8 pellet headshot at 6 feet for 50% of the damage cap but other than that I feel as decent hits with them is almost always between 60 - 120. ARs obviously have tons of bloom but its clear shooting test 2 will never happen. But at least FSA allows you you to hit well placed headshots for fast knocks. 

The Drum gun is the only real problem with the game in its current state. Its an AR / SMG / LMG / Shotgun all in one for no drawback at all. It can kill an entire drop zone in one magasine and easily outperforms shotguns up close and ARs at closer medium distance. Normal SMGs simply dont hit for enough damage and with the fire rate nerf the Tommy is always a better choice, most people take a green tommy over a gold P90. 

If the drum gun was toned down somewhat this game would be perfect in my opinion.

First off I want to state that a part of me will always love Fortnite, but a much much bigger part of me hates it right now. The state that this game is in at the moment will not hold customers, and fans in the amount you have seen for too much longer. Soon you are going to see a loss in sales and players, and it's no wonder why. A lot of people are starting to/already hate this whole SMG/Drum Gun/Spray and pray meta. It without a doubt takes away from the more skilled players, and creates a somewhat even playing field for even the under average players. It also takes the rush/intenisty away from being able to get yourself out of tight pinches between two players/squads. Before the spray and pray meta, I found myself eliminating players on both sides of me in those pinches, and coming away feeling great. Now when you're getting pinched and sprayed from both sides you stand almost no chance, and it feels absolutely terrible. Honestly getting sprayed by two smg's or Tommy's at the same time, makes me think of the days that two people could simultaneously shoot guided missiles at your fort. It's ridiculously OP and got vaulted for a reason. I have played since day 1 of Battle Royale, and so have the majority of my friends. I had a solid group of 8 friends that I used to play with for hours and hours each day. At this point most of my friends don't even bother to get on anymore, which I don't really blame them cause I can hardly stand to be on for more than a couple games nowadays either, it's just too frustrating and far less rewarding. When I started playing, my friends and I loved every aspect of this game, but the one thing that stood out from all other games clear as day is right in the name. FORTnite.. the forts and the aspect of building. Making your own cover, building a fort to be ready  for intruders running from the storm. It was something that seemed so special and that no other game could compete with. The level of skill it took to win build battles was incomparable to any other online multiplayer game, and the feeling of out building someone and eliminating them was pure joy. With each building update the game got better and better. There were many times when I questioned if the game could even get any better than it already was, and you guys kept coming out with great Updates... At least until recently. It's frustrating to say the least because it almost feels as if Epic is catering to the less skillful players. The thing is, I wasn't very good to begin with either but instead of giving up, I decided to keep playing. So I found myself dropping more populated places, and challenging more skilled players over and over again until I learned from my mistakes and kept getting better. Now it feels as if I, and many others around my skill level are being punished for taking the time to learn how to build faster and more efficiently in fights. Anyway I've wanted on for too long now. Drop any comments, or thoughts on what you guys think. I'd like to hear from the rest of the community as well.",FortNiteBR

I absolutely love finishing kids off in this game. Now i wasn’t always like this, back in the days i had mercy and didn’t finish kids unless i desperately needed their mats. But that changed when one time i downed this kid in duos and i let him live and proceeded to go find his teammate that i got down to low hp before he knocked me and he instantly finished me, im talking shooting me before its even possible to finish me. 

That particular moment just really pissed me off and ever since then i vowed to always finish everybody i knock. I even finish knocked kids who were knocked by another team. But honestly my favorite is when my teammates are all dead and im 1v4ing a squad and i knock one, i immediately make it my top priority to finish the fuck out of him before i die, even if that means getting sprayed by 3 different directions and dying right after.

Buffing materials is only going to damage the early game experience and it’s going to turn new players away. I was so happy when Epic Games nerfed the small plants, so when you hit them it took 4 hits to destroy, giving you a total of around 6 wood. However, in the latest patch, they returned the plants to their normal state of one hit to destroy, leaving you with 5 precious wood pieces. 
I am outraged and angry!
Do not buff materials! How am i, a novice Fortnite player, supposed to win a game, a #1 Victory Royale (yeah baby). If other players have materials in the late to end game, once they have killed all of the good players? I need Epic games to keep nerfing materials. This way I can keep winning games!

There already exists a different sensitivity setting for ADS, so I believe this wouldn’t be very difficult to do. 

This setting would allow people to work on building faster, without affecting their aim. So let’s say you play on sensitivity 8, and you can already build cleanly, but whenever you turn up the sensitivity, it negatively affects your aim. This setting will negate those negative affects. It will also allow you to improve your building speed separately from your aiming speed. 

Obviously this only affects those of us who haven’t mastered level 10 sensitivity yet. Which I believe is most people. I personally play on around 8.5. I’m comfortable aiming at that speed and I would like to turn my building speed sensitivity to a 10. Let me know what you all think. What sensitivity do you guys play at? 

If you play at 10, is it because you’ve always played at max sensitivity in all games since you started gaming? Or was there a specific game that helped you progressively improve until you could max it out in all other shooter games. ",FortNiteBR

How it works: like I said, very simple. Only headshots are allowed. There would be increased spawn rates for higher tier recovery items like the chug jug, slurp juice and medkit.

Heavy weapons will be increased in spawn rate by just a little and more ammo for all weapons would be included (except for rockets)

Obviously explosives would be disabled and anything else that cannot do direct damage to the head (Stink bombs, grenades, etc.)

The harvesting tools are obviously still there, they cannot do any damage though.

Also, all shotgun pellets that hit the head will do slightly increased damage.

Details:

* PC: Windows 10, 1080 TI,  AMD Ryzen 7 2700X 
* Not reproducible at will: happens randomly while playing or sitting still and doing nothing, but it seems to happen every match
* In season 4 this never happened once to me
* It started happening right after a patch in season 5
* After the most recent patch as of today (8/21/18) it got 3x worse
   * it used to look like what the clips show but only for half to 1 second, now, every time it happens, it goes on for twice as long as before
   * It happens 1-4x per game, frequency is about the same as before latest patch
* I saw comment where someone said their ping spikes when they get these massive FPS drops, it appears that mine spikes a little bit as well
* This never happens in overwatch or CSGO

Clingers should stay in the air before they blow up, giving you a chance to run away instead of just die the instant the wall breaks.

2. The game wont attract players as most competition they face are way too good for them, and there is no skill based matchmaking.
3. The average player eventually gets bored of fortnite as it will no longer be a fun game to chill and play but it will turn into a sweatfest where you have to try your hardest and play passive to get a win. They eventually begin to play less, or quit. ""Fortnite eSports"" encourages this type of play, granted there is money on the line, but players will see it as a way to win.
4. Now the game consists of mostly extremely good players, pushing away new players even more.
5. The playerbase will decrease extremely slowly, but the effects will be seen overtime.

Alot of people have a strong opinion.  In my opinion its annoying to have someone sitting in a tower spamming your attempts to push. You can only really beat it out with explosives but sometimes you dont have them.

So I suggest to increase drop rate on launch pads and bounce pads. Mostly launch pads though. I think this would make 1 by 1s less viable because often you could just launch onto their 1 by 1. Its also fun as hell to lauch onto people. This would also make it easier to escape the storm which some people may not like. But I think it would be better there would be more populated end circles leading to a more aggresive game packed with more fights.

Thats just me though. Feel free to debate me in the comments if you dont agree.

Unbreakable Hatch: still no clue what's in there. The mystery has died off though. Is it nothing, is it just a lost reference. Are they planning something? 

Dinosaurs: The dinosaur footprint has been covered by the water at the foot of the Viking hilltop. But there are several metal dinosaurs in Paradise palms.

Destroyed tilted: Tilted towers is being built back up after one building was hit by a meteor, and was almost hit by a spaceship before being saved at the last second by a rift. But is tilted ever going to be destroyed or altered more than it has been? 

The movie: what was part of the movie last season? Was it all real and being filmed? Will the trailer for next season explain? Will it be shown when risky reels is up and running? 

Moisty mire: What happened to it. Where did it go? Is Dusty divot going to BECOME Moisty mire with the water, the trees, and a structure similar to the prisons layout in the middle? 

Hop Rocks: Are bounce pads powered by hop Rocks? The animation is very similar and the sound is also very similar. Are the rifts caused by the Hop Rocks energy? 

Loot lake: What is under loot lake? Is that some sort of teaser for a new POI or just a visual glitch? Will we find out soon? 

Time: How much time has passed since season 4? Dusty divot looks run down and not kept up, but tilted looks like it is being revitalized. Is this indicative of how players quickly went back to tilted towers and forgot about Dusty after the initial curiosity? There are also a lot of small changes that seem to be happening in realistic time tables, so this makes me believe that the Fortnite universe does follow the small time as normal, I.e, the building in tilted is being fixed at a pretty reasonable pace, but Dusty divot is not changing much at all. And Dusty looks so much older? Does this mean that it has been a while since season 4 ended in the games timeline?

Rarely ever seen these post before this week so it only leads me to believe since everyone is forced to use this gun and inturn more people are dieing from this gun, the salty kids that get killed immediately come to reddit to pitch their nerf idea, i highly doubt any of you wanted the gun nerfed when you needed to get your kills with it but now that you got yours you are mad that someone else is getting theirs on you so you want to make it harder for them.

The minigun is fine where it is right now, they already nerfed the damage before the challenge came out and there is no need to nerf it anymore because all the ideas i have seen take away the miniguns purpose. Miniguns have hundreds of rounds with no reloading that is how it is supposed to be and that is how it will stay. In a week or two most people be done with that challenge so just deal with it and start complaining about the grappling hook that is coming instead.

What if there was a bigger decrease in movement speed when holding it, and it also affected the turn rate of the gun? By that I mean you can't do full 360's with a minigun while spraying bullets instead, you would have a VERY slow turn rate.  
  
In my opinion this would do two things that would help the current META out a little. Firstly, miniguns would have to be used in a slightly more 'tactical' way. No more holding w and walking at them since you move a lot slower. Secondly, it allows the ability to counter the never-ending onslaught of minigun bullets. If someone is holding w and spraying at your wall, all you would have to do is build around them and they couldn't keep up with turning (since the significantly decreased turn rate). They'd either die or have to switch to another gun which in turn means they can't just start spamming the minigun without charging it up again (which they'd probably die before they did that).

This is not about more XP for kills in general, it is about an imbalance in XP across all game modes. This is not included in your comprehensive [Frequently Posted Topics Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/epicplz).*




I've been playing Fortnite since Season 1 and thoroughly enjoyed it!





Jumped right on to play 50v50 when it was announced at last years Game Awards (still love [that trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZcuF1T4Vxw).)



Since then we've got to experience a plethora of amazing takes on the 50 versus 50 game mode. All whilst fine-tuning every little detail; culminating in the recent edition: the most fast paced, intense, yet still team focused, game mode that the Battle Royale genre has ever produced.


The fun of 50v50 has caused me to play more Fortnite in the 5 weeks of this season than any other season before it. Yet I have half the XP that I had at this point in past seasons. This is despite having completed all but one Weekly Challenge (5 kills in Haunted, ofc :/ )




Daily Challenges already force me to play other game modes. Which is completely fair. However, I can't help but feel that I'm being punished XP-wise because 50v50 is my favourite gamemode. It is simply a more relaxed, non-pressue environment, than the other game modes. 




With my current 100% XP bonus from the Battle Pass I'll get ~1,000 XP for a 1 kill game in solos, whilst a 15 kill game in 50v50 will reward me with a mere 500 XP. Due to the fast pace of 50v50 I would understand if kills were worth half the XP of solos, but **no XP at all** just makes me indifferent to my perfomance in each game.




I get that placement should be pretty much irrelevant in 50v50. However, why you get the same amount of XP for 1 kill as you get with 20 kills completely baffles me.




The addition of XP for revives was smart. However, if a player cares about XP in the slightest they're likely not playing 50v50 at this point. Which, I guess, says a lot about my stubbornness.",FortNiteBR

So many gunfights lost due to this stupid mechanic and the random numbers.  

If you really want to go for a competitive scene then you can't make your players rely on a random number and random bullet spray. 

Also you don't have to nerf building by reducing the materials. I don't mind being outplayed by building but reward me by putting the bullet wherever I place my reticle. Shotgun pellets is a good mechanic because it actually shows you if you missed the shot or if it was completely inaccurate but for other guns...why?

I truly believe that there should be two type of players that should and must be rewarded. 

1. Builders 
2. Shooters

Eventually builders and non-builders will have to build for CQC and final circles or simply by meeting another solo, duo or squad. 

While shooters should be rewarded for avoiding building fights and go for a Medium - Long range. 

I truly love this game and it's by far my most played game for the past 8 months but I think it's time to do some tweaks here and there.

* Harvest 50k wood
* Deal 25k damage to enemy structures.
* 100 Player Kills
* 25 Revives

You can also pick up and use other peoples thrown pickaxes (you could potentially carry multiple pickaxes that you pick up off the ground or from downed enemies). 

It would make for some very interesting landing situations (no gun no problem). There would be potential for some high damage close quarters plays - imagine you’re mid build battle and hit a pickaxe toss shotty combo, or accidentally throw your pickaxe off a mountain to the ground to be picked up by some third party, leaving you forced to play aggressive to attain more mats. There would also be the opportunity for a legendary long range axe toss kill. 

Perhaps giving people the chance to try out different pickaxes as well could be an incentive to buy ones they discover they like (EPIC).

My suggestion is that epic take a week to focus on the bugs. And fixing them.

Instead of focusing on adding a new weapon every week (which is amazing don't get me wrong) but it kinda shows that Epic aren't really caring about the game rn. 

Let me just use an example here, around a year ago rainbow six siege released an operation (an operation basically is a 3 month period of time for the ranked season and usually comes with new operators) called Operation Health, in operation health ubisoft took 3 months and listened to community feedback and fixed glitches. No new operators, no new skins and no new maps. 

Epic should do something similar. One week instead of 3 months though. Since they release something new every week. 

Let's be honest here. The game is unplayable Right Now. For me atleast. I already got my full ragnarok and I have no reason to play this season anymore. The game is no longer fun. 

Hopefully all the bugs will be fixed by next season.

* Unlike season 4 that Omega could be seen on some loading screens since week 1, Ragnarok didn't show up in season 5 storyline till now. Taking this into account, is more and more likely that the following weeks loading screens are about/related to Ragnarok.
* There is a Odin painting/portrait made by Georg von Rosen in 1886 with the name ""Oden som vandringsman"", that could be translated to ""Odin, the Traveler"" (season 5 theme is Road Trip, so this could be correlated). I will leave here the link to the said painting which coincidentally coincides a lot with the Road Trip Skin ""mold"" ([link](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/Georg_von_Rosen_-_Oden_som_vandringsman%2C_1886_%28Odin%2C_the_Wanderer%29.jpg)).

""WE GOT OURSELVES A CHOG JOG. WUNDRA ELF. WUNDRA IELD.""

Ahh the glorious Chug Jug. Now don't get me wrong, the Chug Jug is a great item. Just knowing you're going to get to 200 hp no matter what you're at is a great feeling. But I feel there is a missed opportunity with this item... it could be much more unique and valuable than the item that simply ""gets you to full once"". 

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the item is bad by any means, but it could be so much more deserving of it's ""legendary"" status. Right now it's not much of a game changer unless you just happen to be at low health. With minis, big shields, slurps, mushrooms, medkits, and apples all over the map, it's not usually that hard to get up to at least 125-150hp. So there's a good chance if you find a Chug Jug, you're only going to get 50-75 points of health/shield out of it. Sometimes if you already have 200 health you might not even want to pick up a Chug Jug over a decent stack of minis just because a chug isn't usable in the middle of a gunfight like Minis. Having to wait 15 seconds to heal can be very risky depending on the situation. Which is kind of lame. A Chug Jug is legendary, minis are green... the Chug should be the choice every time.

So that leads to my idea: How about instead of waiting 15 seconds then healing you instantly all at once at the end, how about it heals you continuously while you're drinking it, and is a re-usable item until it runs out? Kind of like the Jetpack, it could have little meter under the icon showing how much is left. Like a fresh Chug Jug has 200 points worth of hp/shield in it, and as you drink it it heals 10 points of health per second of drinking it. Then once your HP is maxed it grants 10 shield per second. And if your HP/shield is maxed then you stop drinking it. But you can save whatever's left in the Chug that you didn't use for later or drop it for a friend to use. This would allow the Chug to be that one item people should pick no matter what. It would be usable in the middle of a fight just to get some quick healing just like Minis. And it would never be a ""waste of a Chug"" to drink a Chug when you're already at 150 health or whatever.

Anyways, just a thought. Let me know what you guys think of this idea?",FortNiteBR

This means that additional inputs during this buffer period are ignored and you have to wait for the weapon to fully load before it processes the next command.

This makes it so that the game is unplayable on higher pings because you cannot rotate between your inventory efficiently. Say for instance you were in slot 1 and wanted to switch to slot 3, if you press RB RB, the game will only register the first RB and you'll be placed into slot 2, in order to switch to slot 3 you will have to press RB, wait for slot 2 to load then press RB again once it has loaded. 

The actual process of the weapon switching isn't client side, but the selection box is for KB + M, this is what needs to be implemented for controller so that the selection box switches on immediate input as oppose to waiting for the server to give it the thumbs up that the first weapon has loaded before registering the next.

You can try this out for yourself, disconnect yourself from the game servers by entering flight mode and try to switch around weapons with your KB+M, the selection box will move around perfectly, then plug in a controller and try to do it again, you will move one box then it will not accept any other inputs until you reconnect to the server.

**TL;DR:** The weapon selection box is server side for controller,  creating an unnecessary input delay when switching and inputs during the buffer period are ignored, meaning that you have to wait for a weapon to fully load before switching again. This makes it impossible to play on high ping servers.",FortNiteBR

So how I did this is I calculated that the Golf Cart goes about 15 miles per hour, so I timed how fast it would take to go across the same route the battle bus did (Battle Bus = 40 seconds) which took the golf cart took about 3 minutes and 15 seconds at 15mph.

15 / .315 = 4.725mi = The route taken by the battle bus (see 1)

The Battle Bus took 40 seconds to go 5 miles, to make it easy I rounded the distance of the route to 5mi)

1/3 of 5 = 1.67, 5+1.67 = 6.67

6.67mi per minute = about 400.2mph

The Battle Bus is fucking launching.

*So you know where the chests spawn if you are unfamiliar with the location.

*We all know that 20+ people all go to these places on the first day each game and 50% die unarmed and it the leaves 20 less people in the game.

*More chests spawning means these areas will have less people needing to go there as time goes on, allowing people to play rather than queuing 10+ games on the first day trying to get the challenge done.

But today I’m going to tell you why it’s actually arguably the best spot to land in the game. 

1. Tomato Town house. West of Tomato Town is a house. It has 2 chest spawns and a few ammo boxes as well as a lot of floor loot drops. It also has a lot of furniture that you can harvest to have an advantage over other players early game.

2. Tomato Town itself has two chest spawns. But this is forgiven by the sheer amount of floor loot drops as well as the many sources of easy mats, especially metal (ice cream truck, cars, poles). After dropping at the house outside of Tomato Town you can head in and have all the loot for yourself or kill someone who obtained it for you.

3. The underground road thing? I don’t know what to call it. Not much to be said. It has 2 (or maybe 3?) potential chest spawns as well as a lot of metal objects so it’s pretty easy to have mats early game.

4. Rotations. Tomato Town isn’t the best spot for rotations but it’s certainly possible. You can head down to Dust Divot or Retail Row or up top to Lazy Links or Risky Reels. 

5. Wailing Woods. Wailing Woods is in extreme close proximity which means you can go there and get stacked on wood and brick easily.

TL;DR, Tomato Town is the best spot due to the high amount of chests there that you get to yourself as well as the easy collection of mats from the nearby Wailing Woods.

Recently my account got banned because your system thought I was cheating. The thing here is that I was not using any 3rd party software like cheats or scripts, which can take advantage of every player in the game.

I think got banned because when I was playing a match, my internet usage got expired, so I had to change my MAC address immediately to reconnect to the game, which could have probably triggered your Anti-Cheat system.

Please kindly unban my account, because I already spent $20 in the game to buy Season 5 Battle Pass as well as a couple V-Bucks. I still want to play with my friends as well as to grind for the Ragnarok Skin (Currently Tier 71, just unlocked the Sledgehammer skin).

Seen as Haunted Hills is the only named scary place on the map, creepy carnival could be right beside it, where the two houses and the haunted looking house currently are in between snobby and haunted. There is a lot of room there for such a place. It could give off an abandoned vibe, with rusty rollercoasters, Ferris wheels and broken down shacks. There could also be interactive carnival games, that depending on how good you play them you get either a weapon or healing item/trap of certain rarity. There would also be some rooms that cause controversy, such as a house of fun where you could fall down in the house at any stage or there could be traps within the house that could damage you but not kill you, and also a house of mirrors. (Imagine Jonesy chasing you in a house of mirrors) Of course whilst playing the carnival games you would be exposing yourself to potential enemies. 

I feel it would make landing over that side a lot more attractive and would be a really nice addition to the map. I’m surprised already there’s nothing like this. Also, I must add, the rollercoaster and Ferris wheel could be interactive and able to seat your full squad! I also had the idea the carnival is llama based so all the designs and carnival games feature llama figures or something similar.  On a sidenote, with this new POI could come new skins and pick axes, based around carnivals such as clown skins etc. I feel this would be a very fun area and could be exciting to explore. I’m sure you all could send some suggestions to add to this, feel free.

TLDR; I have a suggestion for a new location on the map beside haunted hills called creepy carnival(abanadoned theme park), it would have interactive rollercoasters and carnival games in which you can win weapons depending on how well you do. This could bring new skins related to carnivals/theme parks. ",FortNiteBR

This will help to stop those annoying moments where you land on a chest first but someone else decides to land with you, wait for you to open the chest and steal your loot for a cheap kill which isn’t really fun for anyone.

They drop to the floor and a machine collects the 'corpse' to remove it from the game (perhaps it comes from the small device that every player has around their wrist). But death isn't the only time we see that machine. When they enter a game it brings them onto the map, and after a game when they return to the lobby. Perhaps they are not killed at all and instead are injured beyond the point of continuation, so the machine activates to collect them, heal them and get them ready for another game, so every time you play, you play as the same person attempting to beat all others.
My theory is this: Save the World shows a world in turmoil after all those zombies show up, right? So they need to train new soldiers to join the fight against them. What if Battle Royale is but a simulation used to train candidates to fight? The storm looks computerised, and how else would you explain that the map returns to the same condition every match after everything was destroyed to obtain resources? Battle Royale was also created originally as a 'teaser' for Save the World, and therefore training candidates for the real fight makes sense.
In conclusion: the map is a simulation, people are teleported back to the lobby and not killed, and the aim is to train people to fight the husks in the main game mode. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is my theory.",FortNiteBR

If you don't agree please leave constructive criticism. Back in season 3, the game was so balanced. The only problem max rocket ammo and shotguns damage. They could just nerf max rocket ammo and shotguns but instead, they added a cooldown between switching guns which brought back double pumping. The game was super unbalanced. So then they nerf shotgun damage which made the game more balanced. They ignored shotguns for a while and then they nerfed max rocket ammo. Which was good but they made rockets too rare and took it out of llamas which nerfed it too much. They could have made rockets more common but instead, they buffed splodes so much that they are just stupid. If you wanted to not get eliminated by an enemy you build but when the enemy only has to use 1 rocket in a rocket launcher or grenade launcher to damage you through walls it's pretty stupid. Then when you try building a 1x1 and you make it 3 high and they just shoot 1 rocket or throw 1 c4 to destroy it then it just kills your mats. They can also just put 2 clingers and trap you and you can't escape clinger damage or throw 1 c4. They got rid of double pumping which made smgs and splodes more used and more annoying then they nerf building which got rid of a big aspect of the game which is building and build battles. Instead, people just shoot the builds or c4 them to get the elimination. This game is basically luck and not skills. If you get any splodes out of a chest that is luck and will make winning build fights and fights so much easier. People have been complaining about this for a couple months now but Epic Games doesn't seem to care as long as people play their game and spend money on it there happy. They are not really good devs anymore they seem to be greedy. Especially with the new Galaxy skin and the deal with Samsung if giving players 15000 vbucks and the Galaxy skin for free if they buy that phone. Instead, players will have to buy the Galaxy skin with money when it comes out because they have a different opinion on phone brands. Fortnite is also making a lot of money there even if their community doesn't like it. How about they listen to there community. Once again this is my opinion you don't have to agree but please don't be toxic. If you don't agree please leave constructive criticism.",FortNiteBR

I think this stacks with the new Stone heads all facing towards said location, as to tease something big coming. 

       I feel that by week 7 the rocket will re-emerge from the rift as it closes completely, decimating Salty as it crash lands from an accelerated speed. The Road Trip skin could be help that the visitor brought back (possibly from his own home world) to the Fortnite map and fix the rifts. 

      This could cause one of 2 things. Either there could be some kind of fallout created from the crashed rocket that could have the same effect that the hop rocks did (higher jumping and no fall damage) on any player inside of Salty Springs. 

       The second less likely theory as that Salty is completely destroyed by the rocket as it detonates on impact. Over time the crater left in it's wake could fill with water. Thus creating Salty Spring or something like that. This could be Fortnite's way of introducing either a motorized boat vehicle, a swimming mechanic, or a rowboat to the game. Or possibly bring in the pool floaty leaked from the game files.",FortNiteBR

Basically it feels as if shotguns, specially the pump and tac shotgun, hit average numbers nowadays versus how much damage they used to hit. Even after the headshot multiplier nerf in season 4. It feels as if you rarely get the full damage from your shotgun unless you’re practically in their face.

This was largely due to the consistent spread patterns the added for each shotgun and a small change to head hitbox size (the neck counted as the head but was changed).

The problem is that before with random patterns usually, more often than not, large groupings of pellets would land in the centre of the crosshair. This would result in higher damage headshots for people who aimed specifically at the head. With the consistent spread patterns there’s always going to be various pellets that miss the target when aiming directly for the head.

Aiming lower to account for that just means you hit less headshots overall. It’s mainly the reason why it feels like a lot of pump shots hit for around 90-120 when it looks to be an almost perfect shot.

I think that increasing the tactical and pump shotguns headshot multiplier wouldn’t hurt considering how you can only hit a certain amount of pellets for each distance.

Just a topic I haven’t seen mentioned much and feel deserves a look into.",FortNiteBR

Please help.,"Hello /r/FortniteBR! I'm posting here as I don't know where to turn and I'm hoping for some direction on how to proceed. 

My son, Cody, is 11 years old. He has a legitimate addiction to Fortnite, to the point that I have lost all hope for him. I fear the well-being of my family as a result and I dont know what to do. Details below. 


It started with him buying skins in December using his mother's credit card. We didnt realize that we had saved the card to his PS4 and by the time we saw the charges on our statement they were too late to reverse. We wrote it off as typical boy behavior and erased the card from the PS4 to avoid it happening again. However, the problems were sadly just getting started. He now spends every waking hour thinking about Fortnite. Hes constantly watching Ninja and Myth play fortnite and tries to imitate them. He has told me that he wants to be a pro gamer when he grows up. The game has seeped into his daily life - when we pass a stack of pallets on the streets, he always wants us to stop driving so he can ""harvest"" them. He sleeps less than ever because hes watching streams or playing. Cody also makes an effort to steal my energy drinks to ""improve his focus."" I suspect that this is due to Ninja's streaming habits. 

However, what really scares me about Cody is how he gets when hes actually playing the game. I can understand obsessive behavior to a degree, because that's how kids are with certain things, but the child has started becoming violent as a result of his online interactions. He screeches profusely when hes killed in the game and he often throws things around the house while screaming and crying. Last week, when my wife attempted to take the Playstation away from him, he stole a necklace from her and threatened to flush it down the toilet if she didnt return the playstation. I suspect that part of this anger is due to the fact that he has never won the game. He always compares himself to Ninja and asks me why he cant be as good as him, and I can tell its tearing him up inside. With that said, his outbursts are continuing to worsen. I am increasingly fearful of what he may do the next time he rages at the game. He refuses to go to school because he sees it as pointless, and feels he should be spending his time improving his skills in the game. My wife and I have tried removing the playstation and setting screen limits, but he screeches and throws tantrums until we have to return the system to him. When I try to calm him, he hits me on the head and thrashes until I have to give in to what he says. I am at my wit's end with the child and I feel like I'm losing my mind. 

Parents, any advice or words of wisdom for this? I am losing my mind and need to do something about this. Any assistance or advice is appreciated. Thank you. ",FortNiteBR

However, I have another theory as well. In all of the loading screens, drift and brite bomber have been getting along. Recently, a picture of a red hooded figure has been found on a tractor in fatal fields. It doesn't ave the ears of drift. The point I'm getting at is that perhaps brite bomber turned into a female drift. Maybe this will be the road trip skin.

The people who get so unbelievably triggered at the game, that when you kill them they proceed to spam message you about “how trash you are at the game” and how “you should just kys”.

The people who get so unbelievably triggered at the game that they continuously send you party invites to attempt to talk trash to you.

The people who feel the need to prove that they were killed by “pure luck” that they challenge you to a 1v1 over and over again while you are just trying to have a good time playing.

Since putting on streamer mode a couple weeks back, I have not dealt with the negativity that some people bring to this community.

In chests you could have a chance to get crafting supplies to possibly craft guns you want, traps you want, or heck even ammo. Being able to craft any gun in the game. Now crafting would come with a risk however. It takes time to craft weapons, so the higher the weapon rarity the longer it takes to craft, I was thinking maybe Common to be 0.5 of a second, Uncommon to be 1 second, Rare to be 3 seconds, Epic to be 5 seconds, and Legendary to be 10 seconds. Another thing is that if you want to be able to craft that gun, you have to have a version of that gun, or a gun in that type in your inventory. Ex. you have to have to have at least a common pistol in order to craft a hand-cannon, revolver, or suppressed pistol. Maybe as another feature, you have a chance to get a gun part out of an ammo-crate. Ex. you would need a Scar barrel, Stock, Body, and Grip to craft one. So you could have 2 ways to craft a gun. Gather crafting supplies from breaking trees, and genral things around the map and have a version of that gun in your backpack to craft the gun. Or find all the required parts for the gun. Maybe we could implement a new type of crate or even re-work the supply drop to drop only the rarer crafting supplies used to craft higher rarity guns.

In this guide I will teach you the ways of the bush to fool your foes, also I will teach you the staring into space tactic too.

•firstly land at the edge of the map to avoid unwanted attention and to loot up.

•then stare into space for a while to start the no skin ritual (all no skins must obey this rule) while making your way to the edge of the circle.

•when you reach the edge of circle proceed to find a bush and camp in it to avoid enemies.

•when the storm reaches the first circle move to the next circle and repeat the previous step until top 10.

•when you have reached top 10 sneak around the remaining players until it is you and the last player. 

•quickly stare into space with a pump shotgun and run around in the open, when the last player starts to troll you, you then use the power of god and anime and look at the last player to deal a devastating 324 dmg headshot. Boom you have a victory.

If you follow all those steps you will be rolling in dubs and you will be a pussy magnet as well as curing your crippling depression that dwells deep in your soul. This method works every time 100% legit no scam.

This is a joke so don't witch hunt me plez that would be much appreciated. Thx",FortNiteBR

* Editing doesn’t really work half of the time, and you need to exit and re enter build mode to edit the structure in front of you.

* Sometimes the game thinks you want to edit the wall behind you for whatever reason, and then proceeds to have a seizure, getting you killed.

* Buildings still look like butter when gliding in, frame skipping and lag are even more present than I thought imaginable.

* For an Xbox One X enhanced game, it doesn’t really feel like it utilises that title to any advantage.

* Draw distance is awful, chests appear unopened but getting close to them reveals that they have been used, player built structures appear out of nowhere in the horizon, putting you in danger without even knowing it.

Solo squads is near impossible now due to the fact that in the past if you had 4 people trying to shotgun you but you took high ground you'd outplay them but now if it's 4v1 you're getting mauled by SMGs, drum guns, mini guns and splodes, unless the team of 4 are completely awful you stand little to no chance of winning when out numbered. I use to moan about how inconsistent the shotguns were more than anymore but it much rather go back to having to shoot someone multiple times after outbuilding them instead of just having people walk forward and spray constantly. I still play most days but I don't have anywhere near as much fun as I used to and it's 100% because of this new 'META'. ",FortNiteBR

For how powerful sniping is, has it become too routine/easy? There are like what 5-6 snipers that one shot with a head shot in this game? Anyone else feel like sniping has become too powerful?

\- Dae definitely has the skills. Just needs a bit of direction. He also needs a bit more time to mature - he has the skills but doesn't have the best decision making.

\- Myth easily gets frustrated when it comes to tourneys. He needs to really have a serious talk with TSM Reginald (one of the most iconic Esports players out there) and just discuss what it means to be a leader. Myth is young so we all know there's room for improvement. Hopefully he takes all the criticism in a constructive manner and ups his game. It's definitely scary to think that he's a fucking teenager. Imagine the kind of player he'll be 3-4 years from now.

\- Dakotaz isn't in the level of - say the Liquid boys - but I think his callouts are amazing and he can definitely play a role in the pro team. 

\- I was really hoping for CaMILLs to improve. Dae likes him A LOT and I thought they worked well together. I think it's all in Mills' head now. He has the skills, definitely. Just really having a hard time adjusting to the pro scene I guess. NY represent, baby. We all rooting for you Mills!

\- Out of all the people I mentioned, I feel like HighDistortion is the most complete player in the TSM roster just because his callouts are A1 and he frags the fuck out. 

\- Hamlinz is an amazing player as well just a little bit indecisive. And I also feel like Hamlinz's play style is being suppressed by Myth's play style. They work great together but I feel like Hamlinz would be better off with Dae since they just wanna run and gun people. But then again, if they're going to Duo scrims, both need to be better at shot calling and decision making.

\- Don't really have information about RealKraftyy, OPscT, Aimbotcalvin - anyone wanna discuss?

Feel free to discuss other pro teams as well! Always love a good discussion about a game I love. Lol.",FortNiteBR

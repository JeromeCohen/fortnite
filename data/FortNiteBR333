Team 1 lands on map the normal way. Team 1 knows which mountain to defend by seeing a star on the map while team 2 doesn’t know which mountain to attack until they get close enough for it to pop up (3 possible mountains; the one next to Snobby, the one next to Salty and the one next to lonely). Team 1 has to defend The starred mountain (defend the star) while team 2 has to collect the star. If team 2 is fully eliminated, then team 1 wins. Once any player from team 2 collects the star, team 2 is victorious. 

Edit: the ship seen on a previous reddit post can have relevance to this LTM idea 💡 Also, if there is a better name for this LTM, suggestions are welcomed. 

Thank you! If you would want to see this implemented, please upvote this and comment any suggestions/concerns/approvals. ",FortNiteBR

I took to the replays to find out how exactly he knew, and it turns out that the game had given him a random audio queue of footsteps. Although I didn't move an inch since that corner was 
 a comfortable corner.

I frequently need to change to metal for disposable or quiet building, or need to place a launchpad quickly but struggle to find the d-pad arrow to change it. However, I rarely need to quickly rotate my building. You probably see where I’m going with this. 

I propose that the change material button be changed to R3 (currently the rotate button) and rotation be moved to BOTH left and right d-pad buttons to rotate building the respective directions. 

This would not only greatly improve material changing, but also make it easier to change it to the desired direction, as opposed to having to click 3 times to get a 280 degree flip. It also eliminates the inconvenience of accidentally rotating and on the much lower chance that it does happen, drastically cuts down the time to go back to the desired direction.

Is it just because the LR backbling is really wanted, so it would bring a lot of $?

I feel like this should be talked about because the people that have purchased the LR or the CTL when they both came out probably thought they were limited and wouldn't come back. Yet we're in may and the skins were back in the shop a  couple of days ago.

If it is about the money that LR would bring, wouldn't they profit just as much from bringing back halloween or christmas skins?

I have recently spent a lot of my spare time creating a mobile app for you guys – [Assistant For Fortnite](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hailzy.assistant.forr.fortnite)


I have updated all values within the app, such as the new burst rifles, to be relevant for season 4. 

The app consists of the following features to help you learn, improve, and have more fun

- Hand written tips of three sections - beginner, intermediate, and advanced

- A clear and correct, up to date list of all in game weapons and their stats

- A clear, searchable view of the Fortnite Map, showing a chest heatmap and a map of all vending machines

- A random drop picker, which will choose the location which you're dropping at

- [Fortnite stat tracking] (https://www.stormshield.one/) - Kills, wins, comparisons and more 


I would love for you guys to check my app out, and leave any feedback or desired features here. I want this app to be useful for any player at any level of Fortnite, and want its features to be community driven - you guys choose what more you want, and I will implement that for you.

The app is free of charge and doesn't contain ads - this isn't making me any money, I simply want to help other players out and learn to become a better dev in the process!

I then went back on my PS4 and I now can't stop noticing the input lag thats making the game feel slow and clunky.

I was wondering if any of you other ps4 players notice this. Bare in mind I do not have a ps4 Pro.

If anyone knows how to fix this I'd love to know as most on my friends are on PS4 and we don't want to come up against pc players by using cross platform play.

Thanks in advance :) ",FortNiteBR

I am steadily getting alot better at building but one thing that seems to naturally stop me is that you always have to press a button (L1/L2/R1/R2) twice (or hold it down) to place a certain tile, if you switched to it from another tile. Especially in build battles it really affects my building speed and sometimes causes me to spam buttons a bit too much. I would like to suggest another Building Layout (?). The Layout would actually be the same as Builder pro, but you would only have to click once to place the desired tile.

I know that this will leave out the possibility to pre-edit a tile before placing it and I can only talk for myself about this issue of course, but I honestly cannot remember when the last time was that I pre-edited something since I switched to Builder Pro. I would love to trade the pre-editing in for the possibility of building A LOT faster. 

Please tell me what you think about this, I don't think it would be THAT hard to implement and it really would not harm anyone if it was implemented as a choice. I just don't know if it's gonna happen because it's a game mechanic taken away (pre-editing).

Imagine how frustrating the tournament would be if kills had a huge impact and you didn't encounter anyone for the most time in the match. The amount of people you encounter is just way too random right now.

Here are some suggestions for weapon balance that would eliminate some of the RNG and unavoidable-ness (is that a word?) from Fortnite PvP.

Pump Shotgun: Everyone uses it, it either does 9 damage or one-hit kills the target. Widen the spread significantly to reduce its effectiveness at range and improve your chance to hit a target at close range, or remove it from the game entirely.
Rocket launcher: This weapon needs to become a primarily anti-structure weapon. Reduce the strength and range of the splash damage against players so that it can't one-hit someone who has full health unless it's a direct hit. Make it a powerful tool to bring down structures.
Supressed SMG: No one uses this thing. Buff the rate of fire. The accuracy should stay the same to limit its effectiveness at range.

As many of you saw, we had such a huge success introducing our Fortnite tournament concept system a few days ago. If you missed the original post, please check it out here to get caught up:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8jn8yw/fortnite\_tournament\_concept\_looking\_for\_help/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8jn8yw/fortnite_tournament_concept_looking_for_help/)

We really appreciate all the overwhelming support from the community! Here's some things we've achieved in just the last couple days:

\-created a KICKASS name! \-\- Fightnite \-crafted, coded, and designed a highly\-functional discord server

\-attracted and registered 150 server members, including over 20 staff members \(admins, moderators, business people, content creators, designers, and many other creators!\)

\-purchased a website domain and official domain email

\-created a Paypal and have received over $100 in donations

\-drafted a complete business plan and tiered tournament system to maximize effectiveness, competitive edge, and entertainment value

\-designed a logo \(it looks fire!\)

Our tournament system is still in the making, but here's a little sneak preview as to what it will be. Our tournament system will be a multi\-tiered, reward based hierarchy that ranks players based on skill. Original placement will be by Season 4 K/D, and progression through the tiers can be achieved by tournament performance and a complex ELO skill rating system! Here are the tiers:

**Bronze**: 0 \- 0.99 K/D

**Silver**: 1 \- 1.99 K/D

**Gold**: 2 \- 3.49 K/D

**Platinum**: 3.5 \- 4.99 K/D

**Diamond**: 5.0\+ K/D

The Diamond Bracket will be streamed weekly as our premiere Twitch tournament! It will feature commentators, graphic overlays, and an advanced spectator system. Our goal is to start streaming the weekly tournaments next month. If you are still interested in participating, we are open for player registration, everyone is welcome! Please follow the link to our discord server in the subreddit listed below to be eligible to play.

We are so incredibly excited about all the support and the huge opportunity this has created. We want to continue to grow and attract the attention of everyone in the community! Here's how you can support us:

Subscribe to our brand new subreddit!  [http://reddit.com/r/fightnite](http://reddit.com/r/fightnite)

Join our discord server! If you are interested in playing, you can register here as well \-\- please join our subreddit to find the discord server link.

Donations are a huge way for us to keep our growth at a fast rate! You can join the discord server and check under the #donations channel to see not only how to donate, but all the perks that are included in your donation. We want to spread the love back!

We are currently expanding the discord, designing the new website, creating social media, crafting the Twitch overlay, and many other exciting expansions that will come to life in the next couple weeks, so we can be ready for our first tournament and stream! We are also still looking for positions such as commentators, designers, content creators, social media managers, and more! Please contact me if you're interested in helping.

Thank you all again for your great support, looking forward to see you in the subreddit and discord server!",FortNiteBR

It is, by far, the most common Epic rarity item, and while it is the only Epic healing item, it just doesn't feel worthy of that title.

Slurp Juice was introduced when the Shield Potions were the only other shielding item in BR. They were designed to be balanced with the Shields \(faster to drink, granting Health and Shields, 25/25 which balances the 50 of the Shield\). Paying 300 materials for a Shield is understandable, but 400 for a Slurp is a desperation move.

Bringing Skull Trooper back would bring in TONS of money for Epic and I would totally understand if they were to bring it back. However bringing it back would ruin the skin for everyone that had it before the re-release. Although I don’t have the skin, I would hate to see EVERYONE running around in it. So here is my suggestion, bring it back with small tweaks or give the people that owned it before an exclusive back bling or something. The tweaks could be something like a different mask or a different shade, something noticeable in game. If any of you are familiar with League of Legends and the Urfwick skin it would be something like that. The owners of the skin from years ago got a crown on their head while people that bought it recently did not.

tldr: Slightly change older skins on re-release so they are not ruined for the people that bought them before.",FortNiteBR

I thought the reset was a day and 1 hour but it turns out that the featured is leaving in a day after it was release which was lame. No I can't buy it either because I am a poor 17 year old so don't say for me to just directly buy it but I just wanted to know how long it took for others to get it refunded.

First of all, I know its just a first offical implementation of anything competitive in Fortnite BR; and I know that we are just getting started. But thats why I think that feedback is needed.

After playing around 15 games so far, I've noticed that people are playing a lot smarter, avoiding fights they dont have to fight and for fights they take, they put a lot of ""passion"" into them.

However, I feel like scoring / ranking system is quite bad. I understand that this is Battle Royale game, winning is the only thing that matters, BUT , can you even compare a victory with 2 kills and victory with 20 kills? In what world are those the same thing?

Fortnite BR without action isnt Fortnite we all love. Scoring system like this makes camping inside of a house ,as long as youre in a circle, more viable than doing anything else. It leads to dull and boring gameplay which Fortnite is not known for.

Something simple as getting 3 points per kill, 1 point per 300 dmg done to players and 1 point per assist would make it a lot more interesting.

I hope that rest of the community feels the same way, if you dont please tell me why in a comment. Cheers.

TL;DR: Please add additional points for kills, dmg and assists to make camping less viable and game mode less boring.",FortNiteBR

I think that the storm should change a bit because it's not fun to land somewhere and have to run across the map for 50% of the match to survive. 
I think that the circle should change size 10 time instead of 5 time per match and the storm timer should be shorter so the game won't take 30min (the storm change numbers are just examples i don't actually know how often the circle changes size)

 I think that if a wall has like 20 hp and you shoot that wall with a bullet that dose 100 damage the bullet should pass through and only like 60 damage
1 hp on wall -2 damage from bullet

Imo, kills should be multipliers for the points you earn for each place.

Example:
X kills give X/2 multiplier or so (min multiplier is 1).

If 1st place is 100 points, a 1st place 8 kill win should give 400 points because it's better than a 1st place 1 kill win (100 points), or 3 kill win (150 points).

Practical example:
Imagine getting second place with 16 kills and dying to a bush camper who wins by killing you and getting your first kill. Who's the actual skilled player here, you, or the bush camper? 

If second place gets 75 points and first gets 100 points, imo he'd unfairly get more points than you. 

But with a multiplier, he'd only get 100 points and you'd get 75 * 16 / 2 = 600 points, which is an accurate representation of the skill here.

Obviously epic would have to tweak the points and the multiplier status so you can just land tilted, clean up 10 people and just die but get an amazing amount of points, but imo this would be a better system.

1-10th place gets you 10-1 point(s).

Each kill (if you die) gets you 1 point.

So if you win with 10 kills you get 30 points.

If you get 2nd with 10 kills you get 19 points.

The .50 cal would be a heavy sniper rifle.  It would be a chest up one shot, even with full shield.  It would have the same zoom scope as the bolt, however it would hold 5 shots per mag\(I chose 5 cuz 5 is a nice number, but this is debatable\).  To prevent this from being OP, not only would it have massive recoil so you can't spray it\(it'll be semi\-auto\) it'll have a large gap of time in between shots\(1.5 seconds\) it'll shoot tracer rounds\(when you shoot there will be a little smoke trail behind the bullet.  This lasts about 2 seconds.  It'll have a lot of muzzle flash, so that you can see it being fired, even from a distance.  And on top of all that, it'll take anywhere from 3\-5 seconds to reload it.    Think of the delay like the hand cannon delay and recoil, but with an extra .5 seconds added onto the delay, and it would have a bit more kick..

The weapon will be based on the Barrett M82A1 sniper rifle\(huge Mw2/Mw3 fan, sorry lmao\).  This design will be both badass and unique.  

The gun would heavily impair your movement speed.  You will move about 15&amp;#37; slower, there will be about a 5&amp;#37; longer gap between jumps so you can't halo jump, and a decreased jump height.  The swap in time will be slow \(2\-3 seconds\) and the swap out time will be the same speed \(2\-3 seconds\).  

This gun, like the real life variant, would shoot through materials, however, it will only shoot through wood, to prevent it from being too OP, and to encourage the use of materials other than just wood when panic building.

It will have a small amount of sway when aiming, very subtle.

So basically, you're sacrificing movement and jump speed, quick weapon swaps, and fast building\(reactive/panic building\) for an almost guaranteed one shot.

Building has us pretty stumped, and Ive seen now how you can edit structures before placing them, and we know you need 300+ of your resources to be safe. Is there a Best way to get good at building? I know there isn't a sandbox mode, but we hella need the practice. 

My other two concerns are jumping and shooting. Ive tried everyway under the digital sun to get to the ground first, but there still seems to be people getting there ahead of me, is there something I'm missing?

As far as shooting goes I just can't hit shit. This could be because I'm not a top tier gamer to begin with, but we play a fair amount of games and I'm not _bad_ at video games.  I'm not sure what it is I don't do/understand that's leading to bad play.

In High-Stakes Blitz, you pay in a certain amount of cash or V-Bucks, say $1.50 or 150 V-Bucks, and get a great payout depending on where you placed. 

Placing in top 25 would allow you to break even. 

Playing in top 10 would award you 300 vbucks.

Placing first would award 500 V-Bucks!

Blitz would be the mode of choice to prevent camp abuse.

I think this would be a great introduction to a more competitive side of fortnite that everyone could have a chance in! 

Do you guys have any suggestions? Value adjustments? I would love to hear them.",FortNiteBR

Any possibility a 6 yr old at that time in 2013 would have been remotely involved with Fortnite? Lol. He flipped shit and raged when i disproved his claim of experience. Any help would be great.,FortNiteBR

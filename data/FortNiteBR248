The only way to change it is to keep being vocal about it.

The building nerfs, smg sprays, shotgun nerfs etc has ruined the way the game is played. The skill gap is being destroyed and what made the game so fun is simply not there anymore. Not to mention the fact that console is almost unplayable. 

Comments will say “don’t play if you don’t enjoy it” and believe me, I haven’t been. Doesn’t mean I’m not bummed that my favorite game with so much potential is being ruined. Everyone I know has gone from playing the game a few hours a day to barely playing a couple times a week.",FortNiteBR

* Over the past week I've noticed more and more people complaining on this subreddit about the current state of the game, the spam meta. I've also noticed the average people online sticks around 25k(ish) when previous weeks have been 40k(ish)  

* I'm sure y'all have noticed that Epic has been keeping us in the dark lately. Previous weeks/season they have been pretty active in the forums and updating us but I see a lot of people complaining and epic not addressing it. Suspicious eh?  

* It seems like Fortnite competitive is not efficient and before you say ""wHaT aBoUt SuMmEr SkIrMiShEs"" I feel like there has a lot of controversy around them. You see all these eSport teams like (optic, tsm, faze, \*insert any eSport team with a Fortnite team\*) sit around and don't really do much. Maybe the occasional ""FORTNITE PRO SCRIMS"" or whatever but the comp scene needs something.  

* I don't even feel like getting into the explosions, building, weakness of shotguns, the drum gun, or SMGs but y'all already know about that ;)  


I want to write more in the post but got too lazy and don't want to be repetitive to what others have said already. The few things I said above are just some of my observations before some tryhard tries to prove me wrong in the comments. I've been playing since release date and have noticed a decline throughout the seasons and thought I'd see what others think. \*Let's try and have a constructive/positive conversation about this.\*",FortNiteBR

Had no wifi or service and definitely couldnt play but after returning i couldnt wait to play again and when i get on im just mowed down by everything with SMGs in literally 2 seconds. Since when do SMGs do so much damage in so little time and the building has less health now so SMGs just fuck up anything you put down and then SHOTGUNS suck now. Its like the game completely changed in a few weeks and tbh i dont like it at this state. Hope they fix the smgs and shotguns and building health or i hate to say it, but i might quit the game.

Positives:

-Always at least 2-3 other players, more if the bus starts near Risky 

-13 chests by my count (including the truck and tree nearby)

-Edge location, lowering the chance of an opponent coming from behind and potentially 3rd partying a fight

-Rift locations, both northeast of Risky (at the Noms sign) and southwest (Easter head near Tomato)

-Great source of metal if you have time to farm, depending on storm circle you could end up with near max wood, stone, and metal (if you rotate to Wailing)

Negatives:

-Usually have to rotate out of Risky, even if it’s just a small amount 

-Unlikely to hit double digit kills unless the bus goes directly over 

-Not much loot aside from Tomato (which isn’t much loot anyway) when you rotate to the center of the map 

TL;DR- Risky has plenty of chests, decent amount of kills, and rifts nearby, making it a good place to land for 7-10 kill wins. ",FortNiteBR

My name is ray and I have autism. I have always had trouble in social settings and never been much of a talker and not to quick with my hands. About 9-10 weeks ago I was introduced to fortnite by some friends and instantly feel in love. I’m not great at and never will be as I can’t move as quick as others. That said I’ve made a lot friends with in the game and am invited regularly to play squads with about 20 guys who have never met me and deal with a bit so great game play. It’s made me very talkative and helped me even in the real world with communicating with other and even some eye contact. I will admit my autism isn’t as severe is others so I am able to help with other like me at a local school and the therapy centers. I’m very lucky compared to most who have Autism or other special need disorders. My 8 year old son also has autism and seeing him communicate with people online while I’m with him and able to witness him verbally exchanging conversation at such a young age has given me great hope that he will develop much faster than I have or did. It’s great that we have made friends with such great people. But seeing my son battle through this with social gaming and developing faster is the most rewarding thing I’ve ever witnessed. Even the doctors and therapists say LET HIM KEEP PLAYING !!!!  Thank you to everyone who has been kind here on reddit and online !!! Sorry for grammar mistakes.",FortNiteBR

Literally everytime I fight someone they're carrying almost no material and a Tommy Gun/P90. I hate the fact that I have to take half of my match farming material just to be sprayed by a P90/Tommy Gun or blown up by some guy carrying 90 million explosives. And even when I do manage to kill them, they are carrying little to no material. I'd rather get double pumped at lightspeed rather than get outdone by some dude spamming.

Turtling has become even worse, despite the fact that they wanted to basically get rid of it. During the last few circles, it's become just straight hiding in 1x1s. It's the same thing over and over everytime I play. I know you all most likely don't share the same opinion, but this game is honestly becoming everything I feared it'd be. Things that didnt need to be nerfed have been, such as materials and shotguns, both which basically feel useless. I used to enjoy the thrill of seeing someone and preparing to get into an epic build battle, but now it's simply just spraying down structures with no way to outbuild it until they eventually get you. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Fortnite, but I havent had nearly as much motivation to play after all of these constant unnecessary buffs and nerfs. ",FortNiteBR

I pulled [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/1k3mv6b.png) from a presentation Epic was giving on Fortnite development.  They're targeting 2160p for the One X, while the Pro seems to be neglected to only 1080p.  The One X is not 4 times more powerful than the Pro, it's less than 2x as powerful, yet it will soon be 4x the resolution of the Pro.

The One X has ~6 teraflops of GPU power to the Pro's ~4 teraflops, meaning the Pro has roughly 65% the power of the One X.  With these numbers, the Pro should be able to comfortably output 1440p as that's only 43% of the pixel count of 4k.  

I know the Pro has some minor graphics bumps compared to the base PlayStation, but these are pretty minor, and imo they're a waste of the Pro's GPU. On consoles, a higher resolution is almost always preferable to improved graphics. I point to Horizon Zero Dawn and The Last of Us Remastered as examples. 

I really hope Epic considers a resolution increase for the Pro as it would do wonders for the game's aesthetic on 4K TVs.",FortNiteBR

Let's look at the current meta.  SMGs shred buildings and players from medium and close range, even after the recent nerfs.  If a player is able to get into range, maneuver around buildings, dodge SMG fire, and land all pellets onto their opponents head, they should be rewarded.  It is by no means an easy feat.  One pump used to be overpowered because of dual pump, you could spam potential one shot damage faster than it was ever intended, but with the delay between switching shotguns (get rid of the delay between switching between pump/heavy and tac) that one shot potential spam is gone.  A one pump is now a high risk, high reward, high skill maneuver. 


No one has an issue with one shot headshots from snipers, however getting one shot by a shotgun is ""better.""  A sniper can be disengaged from you and the battle, sitting alone waiting for the perfect shot.  There is very little to no risk involved with taking a sniper shot, you may give away your position, but not even that is guaranteed. However, with the shotgun you are actively engaged with your opponent.  


This gives every gun a role.  The shotgun is the ultimate close range deterrent/tool and is countered by building and distance.  We have launchpads, jump pads, building, SMGs (if they miss their one pump, they'll get melted), and other shotguns to counter the shotgun.  We have SMGs which counter spam building and do huge close/medium range damage.  We have ARs which are an okay long range tool (could use some love), and we have snipers that ""safely"" do huge damage from a long distance.",FortNiteBR

(No bitching and moaning),"So for EPIC to see standing out from all the crying, whining, and screeching that is allowed to fill this sub, these are the top issues that need to be addressed. 

Constructive comments only please. If we want issues to be fixed we need to stand out from the people who do nothing but bitch and moan no matter what happens.

1.) Console lag, frame drop, stutter, etc.

It seems a lot of people lately (especially xbox) are experiencing crazy drops in performance. This seems to not be a PC issue. This needs to be fixed soon on the basic premise of making the game unplayable for a lot of people.

2.) Hardscoping issues.

For some reason when using certain skins, aiming down the site causes your character to cover 2/3's of the screen including your target reticle. ""Purely cosmetic and offers no competitive advantage"" no longer applies and definitely needs to be hotfixed ASAP. This isn't the usual issue that can wait 2 weeks to figure out. This effects all players.

3.) Support

Its non-existent and it literally takes a reddit post to get anywhere... The money EPIC makes is massive and definitely necessitates making a real support system. People get locked out of their accounts instantly when they issue a refund, but it takes 2 months to get a wrongful ban resolved.

4.) DDOS'ing

People on console are literally DDOS'ing the server to get a free win. In any other game this is easily detected and the offender is instantly banned. 

Not to mention the rampant cheating and exploits to come out of solo showdown.


Again, this is for ACTUALLY getting our problems fixed, not to whine about dying in a video game. Go whine in your own threads.",FortNiteBR

The HP nerf really wasn't that bad. Build-battles still happens every game. Ramp-rushing still works. Turtling with wall spam is still a thing. If you feel you are being shot down more often this season it's because players load outs have changed. People now carry 2 automatics instead of 1. And that's OKAY. Breaking structures was perceived as 'harder' before only because most people ran shotgun over SMG which meant that the only gun worth picking up that could bring down a building efficiently was the AR. I think the hard-to-swallow pill here is that because building is a core mechanic of Fortnite it mustn't be allowed to have any kind of counter. Which is ridiculous.

The pump-shotgun needed to be addressed. Being 1-shot at 200hp was not okay. Double-pumping was also not okay. This extremely accessible gun made season 4 insufferable for anyone that didn't conform. It was a must have weapon and if you didn't have one then you were losing any close-range fight to someone that did. It was promoting an incredibly unrewarding experience and sorely needed to be reworked. It is still viable and works very well on its own or as 1-shot into AR switch, which feels much more balanced.

While shotguns reigned supreme, the SMG gathered dust in the corner. No one touched them for multiple seasons. Then they were buffed and for a short time they were too strong. Which sent this sub into meltdown. They were tweaked once more in a recent patch and now they seem to be in a good place. No, they are no longer over-powered. Personally, I'd drop my SMG for explosives or Heavy. And I won't even touch the P90 anymore.

The SMG nerf did absolutely nothing as ANY SMG shreds you no matter how much you try and build, nothing will counter the amount of DPS it has to structures and its firerate. The TAC SMG was basically useless at destroying building. You maybe used it to spam a wall twice and had to reload, it was balanced. The P90 and Tommy Gun + LMG NEED to be vaulted. The minugun should get have an insane cooldown after maybe 150 bullets are fired. I don't think the mingun needs to be vaulted.

Spoldes are also abysmal and always have been. 100 flat damage once you're in the damage radius whether that be on the farthest edge or right on the middle of it is so broken. Grenade launchers and rocket launchers IMO should only be obtained from supply drops (have your own opinion on it) and the max ammo should be reduced to 8 for grenade launchers, and 8for rocket launchers. You DO NOT need rocket launchers early game. They are designed to counter buildings, I know and that.That is why they should be kept till mid/late game where building is at its peak. The nerf to ammo was amazing at the start because we were used to infinite spam, but you can still spam the hell out of people. The grenade launchers are completely RNG IMO in the sense that sometimes it damages people through structures that appear to be there and sometimes it doesn't, maybe it's just me but it seems like most of the time I get sploded while in a box trying to counter it. Damage from splodes should also be reduced to 50 - 100 damage depending on how close you are to the explosion.

TL;DR: Spam meta is near impossible to counter, vault P90 + Tommy Gun + LMG, make splodes mid-late game only, reduce splode damage.

Epic completely made shotguns unviable,   lowered building health and added a bunch of spam friendly weapons (the SMG, Compact SMG, and now the homing missile). In that time the meta were SMG's but after not even a week they nerfed them and now there's not really any meta active. Their plan was to nerf building which in my opinion didn't need to get nerfed( if someone starts building over you, you can try to outbuild him and learn the main mechanic that makes the game special and not just stand in one place and hold down M1 until he falls down and you kill him thru the buggy walls that stay there once you destroy them). Epic lowered the skill gap to the point where new players have a bigger chance of winning than experienced players( if an experienced player builds over a new player, the new player can just shoot him down and kill him with fall dmg or just random RNG from his bullets). Also the camping that epic is encouraging with the addition of the homing launcher is just unbelievable because they said that their goal is to REMOVE camping.

I realize there have been many posts of similar topics, and that many great points have been brought up.  I realize that change is essential for keeping people's interest towards the game, but I just can't agree with a lot of the balance changes that have made it into the game, and have stayed.  I'm here to hopefully shed my light on the subject, and hopefully bring something new to the table.  I may or may not fail; I have many misunderstandings with the hype-trains of this particular subreddit.

I started playing this game back in mid-season 3.  I was a hardcore League of Legends and PUBG player.  I'd known about Fortnite since its release, but I had no interest as I was a PUBG elitist at the time.  My thought process around Fortnite was the stereotypical: I'm 22 years old, why would I want to play the new cartoon BR marketed towards little kids?  I had watched a lot of Shroud, Dr. Disrespect, and Ninja, and I noticed they had played a few games of Fortnite.  It still looked uninviting, but a seed had been planted.

I later found out one of my friends from college had started playing, and that the game had cross-play.  We booted into a game one day, and we found that this game was like a high school reunion with all of the people that I actually liked.  We had a good time, and with my previous BR knowledge, my friends were impressed by my skills the first day of playing the game.

I started playing cross-play Duos heavily with my main friend.  Building was something that took some time to get used to, but I'm an extremely competitive person and I was focused on ^(just) building ^(lol) good habits right from the start.  I recorded my gameplay, and analyzed every death or fight and decided where I went right or wrong.  Note: I found it extremely easy in Season 3 and 4 to spot out my mistakes, and get a solid routine in to fix the holes in my play, whereas now, it's less intuitive or even impossible.  I grasp that the majority of this is because the closer you near the peak of the skill cap, the more minimal and abundant the improvements needed become, but this is not the same thing.  The game has recently added a drastic amount of RNG factors that come into play every game, and I understand a lot of this is just the nature of BR games, but there's just too much on Fortnite this season.  I don't like taking gambles every game, and losing or even winning due to shit that's out of everyone's control is just fucking stupid.  If I want that kind of psychotic craving, I'll go play poker or bet on sports or even more inviting: eating steel nails.

This entire season, with a bunch of big game mechanics being removed (building being nerfed SO MANY GD TIMES) with most nerfs being indirect and more discreet.  I can honestly say I haven't had a single fight this season where I FEEL like I was outplayed or that I was killed by a better player.  I had a 1v1 fight with FaZe Cizzorz about 2 weeks ago that I won by just spamming drum gun and getting lucky-ass bloom.  It wasn't satisfying, and it felt unfair.  I feel like a fucking scum bag holding mouse-1 on SMG/Drum Gun this patch, because it's a cheap, no fun strat.

In Season 4, shotgun meta was MY SHIT.  I felt so confident in build battles double pumping.  In my opinion, (and I guess I'm the minority?) the game was in a healthy spot, because of the wide range of skill of players.  You actually felt the improvement.  I was loving the spot building was in before the nerfs came in.  Your wood isn't made of paper mache, so building while playing squads and especially solo squads was extremely rewarding. In close up, 1v1 scenarios, blocking shots with a quick build, then having their shot break your build and now you have the next shot advantage felt clean, and it was just another one of those things that set you apart from the rest, and set you up for more advanced plays.  Shotgun meta was amazing because it took into account all of your skills to avoid (as well as deal) damage.  You didn't absolutely require as many heals or shields (more RNG) as you do now with SMG spam.  You're practically guaranteed to take damage in a fight against a competent player.

It used to require much less luck to outplay 4 decent players.  With good aim, good build placement, positioning, editing, blocking shotgun shots, and mats that can take more than a fuck of damage, you could turn that whole squad into a bunch of dizzy bois and take them out 1 by 1 fair and square; even if it involved one-taps.  I have never been one to complain about the pump shotgun one-tapping people.  To me, it was balanced, predictable, and added greater reason to take high-ground;  I KNEW and COULD ACTUALLY PREDICT how much damage my pump shots were going to do.  The second I pulled that trigger, I knew if that kid was going to drop, and could get a quick rotation onto the next opponent.

I played this game the most around this time, and I actually enjoyed playing.  This season, if you try and hop into solo squads, you can't outbuild 3 sweats holding mouse 1 shooting you and your build down, with one of their guys pushing/flanking.  You literally can't beat them unless 2 or 3 of them have heart attacks and die in their DXRACER^tm 's from the intense holding of their mouse click.

The following may unnecessarily offend some: 
I don't care about the casual part of the player base.  I think games should be unfriendly to new players or players that don't care to improve, because it actually should take time and effort to get good and understand really fucking anything in life, and I think enough people will keep playing Fortnite and enough new players will join Fortnite because of the wide demographic it attracts.  I do, however, think that balance decisions, especially these consistent, drastic decisions, can deter players like me away from the game.  I enjoy a game that rewards players for being better than their opponents.  A game where some spammy boi doesn't tilt the fuck out of me and ruin all of the good parts I had playing the game.


TL;DR
I think less drastic changes (mostly revolving around the meta and mats) are more healthy towards the longevity of the game.
I dream of a game called Fortnite Meta: Season 3-Early Season 4, but with all S5 map changes.
I can't play this game with shotguns being as bad as they are and spam guns being as RNG as they are.  Reworking bloom (removing it and adding a new system that takes some sort of skill), rebuffing mats, or bringing back old shotgun mechanics and damage will bring me back into the game.


AND WITH THAT, I'M OUTTIE, unless some big changes happen that satisfy my hunger for Season 3.  I really don't expect any of it to actually become parts of the game again.  It seems like they've completely moved away from it, so it's highly unlikely that I'll be back.
It's kinda really shit, though, cause all I'm left with is no clout, no bitches, no money, a small peepee, and a whole lot of upset.


Oh, and fuck the spammy meta and paper mache lookin-ass walls. Won't miss those fucks.

This LTM has been such a fun experience that I'm left feeling quite sad to know that it will be gone very soon..

Which raises my question.... Why?

Why do these modes have to be LTMs and not permanent... I get it , there stuff to workout like bugs ect.. but the mode seems flawless at the moment , is it really necessary to take it down for further analysis?

This is the one time I'm gonna post about an LTMs should be permanent topic, because it's honestly saddening to know I might not have this much fun again anytime soon..

First of all, the reason people bought the Halloween skins were to look “scary” for HALLOWEEN. If you really think about it, what’s the real point of putting the halloween/christmas skins back? Is it because you’re obsessed with that holiday? I guarantee not. You don’t want the Gingerbread Man/Skull Trooper because you love Halloween/Christmas so much that you have to beg Fortnite to bring it back. You want it because it’s rare. I’m sure if the default skin was hella rare everyone would want it. Point is, you don’t need a Halloween skin in August, you aren’t that obsessed with Halloween, I’m sure. And don’t say “But the gingerbread man looks SICK!” No, you aren’t obsessed with Christmas and love the skin, you only want the skin because it’s rare. Look what happened to the Red Knight?

 Some people are saying, ""Console has more players, therefore more of them should be in the top 50."" But that is flawed thinking. There are just as many, if not more, top players on PC. It doesn't matter how many players there are. It matters how many players are good on average in each lobby. If there are 30 good players in every PC lobby, then very few of those players will have high kill games, and none of them will be able to average a 15 kill game necessary to win. It's simply impossible.

So instead we're left with PC players who want to compete for high scores being forced to switch to PS4 and use Keyboard and Mouse. Look at the 2nd place finish. He averaged 14 kills and won like 80% of his games. Absolutely impossible to pull that off on PC. Period.

I watched his stream, and he's certainly a very talented player. But about 70% of the players he fought literally didn't know the basics of build fighting. Here is a also a link to him admitting that console is way easier....  [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/290257164?t=03h53m30s](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/290257164?t=03h53m30s) 

There are good console players for sure, and but there is just a higher concentration of good PC players trying to compete in the Solo Showdown, making it far harder to score well. Only solution is to combine lobby so PC and Console play together--or to have separate leader boards for fairness. ",FortNiteBR

I cannot even put a number to the amount of posts just aimlessly complaining about the new meta that I have seen the past week. Everyone is well aware of the ""problem"" by now (I'll explain why I used quotes there in a second, just bare with me), so please, if you must post about the new meta, atleast make it constructive. The new SMGs have been around for long enough now that the complaining posts need to stop. No one cares if the game is stale for you. No one cares that you got killed for the millionth time by an SMG. Stop complaining, start helping.

It seems everyone just wants to complain about certain weapons being unbalanced, some being overpowered, and some being downright useless. This game is far from perfect, and in my opinion, all weapons right now are unbalanced. ARs  are too unreliable with bloom, smgs tear through walls too fast, shotguns don't do enough damage anymore, and pistols are downright useless. The explosion radius of most splodes need to be adjusted, and they need to find a happy medium with building. Right now, everything needs a bit of tweaking. 

Epic HAS TO, and IS trying they're best to balance this game for both new players, and veterans. Without any kind of matchmaking, this game is extremely hard to improve at. Playgrounds helps a bit, but nothing helps more than just hoping into a game and playing against people who are better than you. I like to think of myself as average, and most of the time I just feel bad for new players that I run across in games. At the same time, I feel bad for myself whenever I run across any real pro at this game, cause I even destroyed by better players from time to time. Some days, no matter how good I'm playing, this game just feels impossible to get great at. I can't imagine being a new player at this point, I would have probably given up. 

So what can we Epic do about this? Well, only one or two things really. Skill based matchmaking would be the first option. This has been discussed plenty, and it seems most people lean towards no. I could see this only working one way, with 3 tiers of skills. The first would be everyone with no wins. Noobs against noobs. The second tier would be anyone under 5 wins. So atleast everyone then has a basic understanding of the game, it's controls, and it's weapons. Not hard enough that it will take them months to get to 5 wins, but just hard enough that players will be forced to get better. The final tier would be everyone else. Then atleast even the worst player in the lobby has a chance to stand his own, and get better. 

The only other option is to balance building, the one shot meta, and the spam meta. In my opinion, you should not be able to one shot someone from 200hp with a shotgun. There's a certain amount of luck that can come into play with that (for instance if someone is just standing behind a wall, and as soon as your head comes into view they take a shot, it's lucky on their part because you happened to be close enough, and walk right into where they were aimed). At the same time, you should be rewarded heavily on  if you hit someone directly in the head from a close enough diatance. I get way to many 57dmg headshots on people directly in my crosshair. Double shotguns should absolutely not be a thing. SMGs have to be balanced so that they can tear through someone's build, but at the same time be easy to counter with the right amount of spam building, timing, and headshot damage with a shotgun. In my opinion, lower the damage to building a bit more and they will be in a good place. Pistols need a buff overall, every single one of them needs some major tweaking. I will never carry a pistol with me to mid-late game. Ars bloom needs to be reduced. Snipers are in a pretty good place, especially after the Semi buff. 

Finally, building. It goes without saying that because of building, this games skill ceiling is incredibly high. Every fight doesn't need to end in an intense build off. Sure they're fun, but they can get tedious, especially if they're you're equal and the fight has been going on for 5 minutes. There is a post on the front page now that had a perfect example of how this game should be, where SMGs can easily counter building, building easily counter shotguns, and shotguns easily counter SMGs. It's not there yet, but it's close.

The bitching about the meta needs to stop. Being constructive, and offering helpful feedback is what we need now. I'm not saying this is something that needs to be swept under the rug, this is obviously affecting most players. Many pros have even voiced they're concerns, or threatened to quit, this is something that needs to be addressed. But my god does the bitching need to stop. You don't deserve to shit on noobs all the time. You should have to put up a fight with EVERY player you go against. The SMGs was epics first test on adding a major balance change to the game. It's not perfect yet, but nothing in This game is. This game is updated literally weekly, and things are changed. This sub is just turning toxic with all the negativity. If you're going to talk about the new Meta, keep it constructive. 

TL;DR the meta is a problem right now. Many things are unbalanced, WE KNOW. Bitching about them isn't going to help, keep your posts constructive, or keep them to yourself. ",FortNiteBR

I've been playing since March and up until a point I've enjoyed this game very much and had a blast playing it. But ever since Epic set out on a quest to make new players feel like they are actually good at the game even though they've played for two minutes, I haven't really felt like there was a need to play the game anymore. The shotgun mechanics are stupid, building doesn't matter as much as it used to, and the only way I feel like I can win in a fight is to spaz my mouse all over my desk holding down left click until the enemy is defeated. 

Ninja made a pretty good statement about how he would change the game, saying (I don't quote, but paraphrasing) that double pump, pump tac, and pump heavy should all be brought back and smg's should be nerfed. What Epic is trying to do is shorten the skill gap between good and bad players, which would bring in more players, therefore producing more cash for the company, while completely giving all the OG and good players a big ol'slap to the face. Is it good for money? Yes. Will grow the game? Yes. And that ladies and gentlemen is all that Epic see's at the moment, at least from my persepctive.

For example, Lucky would be lit up by lanterns and this new Tokyo inspired area would be lit up with really colorful lights like it is in real life. Would be cool.

This is just an idea but I think Fortnite needs some color added to it, most of the POI’s are the same vibe. I wanna add some different areas that stand out.

*The time shift to darkness could just be implemented for a Lights Out LTM instead of in a regular game mode*

The other day I tried launching Fortnite on my phone to complete some challenges and I was constantly getting an error and I shrugged it off thinking it was bad service, even though every other app worked. When I got home I tried to log in but I was greeted with the message that my account has been has been disabled. I contacted epic and asked them well how do i enable my account and the robot said that I was banned for cheating. (I don't cheat by the way, nor do i have any cheating applications). Confused, I looked through my computer and found nothing that could be considered a cheat but I did not find anything. The robot also said that the ban was final, and I don't think that's fair because I did not do anything. If it was something else I at least deserve to know what it was, seeing as though i spent a lot of money on this game. It couldn't have been cheating because again i did NOT hack.

PS: They also banned my IP so even if i wanted to start over, I could not.

In this current meta, the p90 would win 10 times out of 10, but if the pump was back to how it used to be, then that’s an ideal counter to this smg meta. Now, you may be saying ‘but pump was too op and will then be too hard to counter’ but that isn’t true, because the one update to the pump that should stay is the damage to structures, so building could still be the pumps counter.

Weapons/items to vault:
Pumps/tacs/heavys

Tactical smgs (fuck it, still OP. Better vault it again)


Changes to materials and building:
Have every destructible item put out 5968 mats just in case a few of those pesky smgs find their way into someone’s hands outside of the vault.
Using the take the L emote makes wood youre standing on completely indestructible and also adds seven slurp juice to your inventory.

Also traps do 7 damage.

This same concept works with clingers.

When the first clinger or remote explosive blows up, they destroy the walls protecting the enemy, then the rest of the remote explosives/clingers blow up instantly in the opponents face. 

Why would remote explosives blow up at different times? Why would destroying a wall instantly blow up a clinger in someones face?

It feels very unfair when you die this way. Walls all around you, then instantly blown up. 

This has been around for awhile and has never made sense to me

It is extremely accurate at close medium range, you can quite literally hipfire it from 30 meters and get 3 - 4 headshots on someone unwary of your pressence. Unlike the P90 it also doesnt fire extremely fast so those 50 bullets feel like youre being constantly barraged + if you dont build you are potentially dead in 2 or 3 bullets. For a gun that is everywhere and is so easy to use, it shouldnt have 50 bullets with a high fire rate, extremely high damage and good accuracy. The LMG's main drawback is that its extremely inaccurate, but the Drum gun does not have this drawback and only really falters against ARs at medium long distance, where the gap can easily be closed by building into drum gun distance.

* !
* Need materials
* Need healing
* Need shields
* Need ammo

If you start playing the game today, those are literally the only ways you have to communicate with your team outside of voice comms. 


Before we go into this, there are a lot of different reasons why people do not, or cannot talk in this game but here are a few

 * Person doesn't have a mic
 * They don't enjoy talking because they are shy/not good at it.
 * They want to play somewhere that you can't be talking to your squad mates
 * They physically cannot talk


There is no ""Thanks,"" ""Let's go"", ""Stop/Go"", ""Follow me"",  ""Group up"", ""Acknolwedged"" or even ""Hello"" that are given to the player for free. All other non verbal forms of communication are locked behind a pay wall AND some of them cannot even be gotten anymore as they are from previous seasons. That Thumbs Up/Down...in a previous season's battle pass. 



Not to mention, in the larger team modes like 50s or 20s, where you can be on the same team as a person but not in the same squad, communication with the 5 given forms is nigh impossible.


**Solutions:**

* **Certain stickers need to be made free**

The Thumbs up/down for example. Stuff like that should never have been behind a pay wall in the first place. 

* **Squad communication needs to be able to be used without an animation**

Why do we need to stop to use these things? Let us keep running instead of the completely pointless hand throw animation. Just make the sticker pop up over our heads and let us keep moving. And while we are on the topic, let us use some stickers while down. Why do I need to wait for my character to get up all the way to throw up the thumbs up/heart/fist bump when a teammate has revived us? That is just extra animation and time delaying us healing or moving out. 

*  **We need more squad communication stickers/emotes.**

All those questions I asked above about the !, yeah we need some ways to answer them. Something like a chest to indicate loot. Maybe a little man with a gun to indicate an enemy. Maybe a trap sticker to indicate a trap. A little man ducking to indicate your buddy needs to get down. A wall to indicate someone needs to build. There are so many things that could be done. Hell, even if only one thing is added, there is still room on the squad communication menu right now for it as is. Or they could add 3 and give us the full 8 like on the rest of the emote wheel. 

And for the love of all that is good and holy, **GIVE US SOMETHING TO INDICATE ""FOLLOW ME"", ""LET'S GO"", ""GROUP UP"", or ""THIS WAY.""** I cannot stress this enough, especially with the big team game modes. There is nothing worse than having your team dicking around right before the storm is about to come in because they were too blind to look at the timer. At least if you are in front of them spamming this sticker/emote they might pay some attention. 

* **Flash the emote next to your squad mates name on the left hand side of the screen**

In League of Legends, when a player uses an emote, their portrait and the emote pop up above the minimap. You don't have to be looking at them to know what they are doing. A similar thing could be done for the current squad information section of the HUD. You can't always be looking directly at your squad mate, so if you pushed ahead and they found something useful, they could flash the chest/loot emote and you could know to come back to them. 

* **An actual, animated emote for things**

Like the ""Follow me"" emote. Literally just needs to be the character looking over their shoulder and motioning for a person to follow them. If you don't know what that looks like, well [let Frankenstein waste a minute of your time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3zEi14PhTo) to help you picture it. Obviously this would need to be free. No pay to win, or withholding good communication from people.  ",FortNiteBR

Ghost peeking? If your camping in 1 by 1 and not pushing what do you expect to happen.

Maybe I should've been more cautious, but isn't 150 damage a bit ridiculous? With just two traps you can instakill anyone, and trapping someone really isn't that hard when you get the opportunity. I'm questioning the balancing of traps, but what do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

Despite all the hate for it, double pump still took some sort of skill in regards to hitting your shots rather than just hipfire spraying an SMG or aiming a reticle and shooting or throwing some type of explosive. Also, building was way more effective in the past metas than it is now, something that I think they need to emphasize more rather than less. Continuing to nerf building in the form of material gain/HP of builds makes the game more noob friendly and makes me want to play less, as I have started to do. Thoughts? ",FortNiteBR

""Building sucks now!"" ""Someone less skilled than me just beat me with an SMG!"" Sound familiar? Of course it does, we're on the Fortnite sub. But is the game really as bad as people are saying?

I've been playing off and on since before seasons and the battle pass were a thing. I remember when supply drops didn't even exist, when there were about six POIs on the entire map and what felt like only three different guns. Some of you other old-timers might even recognize me as the guy who ""suggested"" Haunted Hills, even though that was just a coincidence with the name. And I'm writing today to say that I like playing Fortnite, and this is going to sound crazy but I even like playing Fortnite right now.

Let's talk about the meta. Yes, there are lots of ""spray and pray"" weapons right now that fill very similar roles. SMGs, LMGs, drum guns. Hell, people even use the minigun now and that used to be considered an absolute garbage tier weapon. At the same time, building health and mat harvesting have been nerfed. Is the game worse off because of it?

The main complaint I see is that it ""caters to casuals"" or ""makes building skill not worth it"". That's simply not true. Building still gives you a massive advantage and everyone who's good builds. Do less-skilled players with SMGs occasionally get lucky and win fights now? Yeah, and I think that's good. They're getting just enough of a taste of victory to be having fun, but if they have two brain cells to rub together, they'll recognize that they're still losing most of their fights to people outbuilding them. I think that's good incentive to keep practicing and working on building skills while still having fun, instead of quitting in frustration because the good players are light-years ahead and they have zero chance.

I think some people want a game where the more-skilled player wins 100% of the time. I think in a game without a ranked mode with skill-based matchmaking, that's a good way to lose the more casual players that make up the vast majority of the playerbase. I also think a lot of people just burned themselves out by grinding to 80 last season for the Omega unlocks, and need a break from the game now regardless of what the meta's like. Maybe it's because I didn't play much last season that I'm playing a ton now and loving every second.

Are tweaks needed? Sure. My biggest beef is that brick is now strictly better than wood, since they both have the same starting HP, but brick has a higher max HP. I liked it better before when they each had their place. I also liked getting 30 mats from chests instead of 20. The pump is pretty bad now, but after having its place in the sun for almost the entire life of the game, I'm okay with that. People now take the heavy shotguns even though they used to get passed up for lower-rarity pumps, so to me that's a sign of better balance. And there are probably too many SMG-esque weapons now, but I'd be shocked if one of them doesn't get vaulted, probably the drum gun once all this time-travel stuff is over.

I don't know why I felt the need to write that huge post. I'm just having a lot of fun with Fortnite right now, and changing metas are good for the game, even if you're not a huge fan of the current one. I'm sure we'll have a new one soon, so take a break and come back then if you're really that unhappy. I'll be here playing and enjoying myself because the game is still a blast.",FortNiteBR

Secondly, i know for console, if turbo building was gone it would be a nightmare, this is more in regards to PC. Ultimately, turbo building made it where anyone could engage in decent build fights without nearly as much skill as those who don't use turbo building, it has turned into an all too powerful crutch that a lot of players use, and would be met with backlash if it were to be taken out of the game, because it has almost become a core part of the game at this point.

Epic is threatening community-developed content with take-downs,"Hi, I'm the developer behind the Companion for Fortnite app which has been helping StW and BR players for a year now.


After my first e-mail contact with Epic back in February I've supplied lists of vBucks scam apps and apps similar to them in order to further help out the community. This time the e-mail took an unexpected turn. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Now according to the Epic Games legal team:**

-----
**Any Website or App that uses as much as one icon from the game has to be de-monetized, or have all the assets removed, otherwise they will face a legal take-down.**
-----

&amp;nbsp;

You can view the entire e-mail conversation here (personal information replaced with red): https://imgur.com/a/uLHPyY4

&amp;nbsp;

It should be rather obvious that this would **hurt the community immensely** if all the tracker sites, shop sites, cosmetic trackers and Apps would be removed, or have all the images and icons removed. All of these community resources use assets in some capacity and even just having a vBucks icon as a supportive element to the price in the daily shop rotation is enough to break their policy. Most websites would not be able to operate without Ads due to the costs of servers, so having them Ad-Free is not really an option- if you add development cost then the **community developer side of Fortnite would be gone**.

&amp;nbsp;

The logical reasoning should be (taken from the e-mails, so if you read the e-mails, this is a repeat):

-----
""So what is the main difference between these Emote Apps that violate the Fan Content Policy and the Companion Apps?


Well, they monetize your content, the entire purpose of those Apps is to show content that is yours, and monetize it.


While the Companion Apps provide features and services that are only **supported** by game related assets.


A few examples from my App (the other Apps are BR only, while mine supports both BR and STW):

* Many of my users use the App to check out the current missions in StW, see what the rewards are and what the mission type is. They can filter by zone, rewards etc so they can save time by not having to look at the in game map.
This feature also has icons from the game, of rewards and mission types. The users are not using this feature in order to look at your content(icons), they are using it for the sake of feature, getting a much more user friendly mission browser.
* When a user looks up a Hero in my App, it will also show the hero portrait, but they are most likely not using the feature to look at the portrait, they are using it to get a list of the perks and bonuses. They can also select a Perk/Bonus in order to find Heroes that match the desired Perk/Bonus, this will also show portrait and icons, but it's not the main use case.
* If a BR user is going to compare the detailed stats of two weapons in the App then he has the option to see all the weapons as the game icons in order to easily find the correct weapon, he is not using the App to view the icons, he is using it to compare weapons stats.
* If a StW user is looking up his profile in order to see his Alert or Storm cooldowns, level or other profile information, then the view will have icons from the game representing the different data elements, the main objective of the feature is still to show the profile stats, not the icons.
* If a StW user is looking in the resource list he will see the in game icon of the resources, but what he is after is the description, sources and uses of a resource in order to make in game decisions or just finding where to farm the resource.
* When a StW user goes to the notification settings and ticks the ""vBucks - Plankterton"" topic (in order to get a notification when there are vBucks missions in Plankteron), he is doing it in order to make sure he won't miss the vBucks mission in Plankerton when it arrives, not to look at the vBucks icon.

**The main point of these examples is to show that any Fortnite content used is used as a supportive element, never the main element of a feature. This is by far the most important difference.**""

-----

Add to this the weird irony that according to the same policy Youtube videos are allowed to be monetized, even if the user just records 10 seconds of an emote from the game, converts it to a 10 minute video without any other work done, all good to go, ad-monetization: OK! :) Makes perfect sense *shrug*

-----

If the community doesn't let their voices be heard then in the very near future:

* You would have to login to the game to get a glimpse of your stats.
* You would have no way of looking up the stats of other players.
* You'd have to start the game to view the daily shop.
* You'd have to wait for the daily shop to contain a certain cosmetic to even view it.
* You'd have to look at every mission node in StW to see what/where the rewards are.
* There would be no way to see hidden data like Alert and Storm cooldowns in Save the World.
* There would be no way of seeing the detailed stats of weapons.

Could go on for a while but the point should be clear by now, there's been a staggering amount of features created by this community. It would be an absolute shame to have them disappear.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

-----

**TLDR**: Does it make sense for the legal team to issue take-downs for simply using icons as supportive elements in community developed content? I certainly don't think so, but it seems the legal team has made up their mind now.

-----

&amp;nbsp;

**So, what does the Community think about this? Does it sound reasonable?**

In my opinion, it is why people play online video games to begin with, to earn acknowledgement and show off the things they have achieved.

This was a... Odd, time, to simplify it. No one was too good at the game and building just wasn’t used ever, and shotguns could one shot from 50m away for whatever reason. Oh, and AR headshots did 70 damage. Was it fun? Meh, everyone seems to like it simply because “gOoD oLd dAyS”

My rating? 3 Stars. Game was increadibly broken at the time.

Season Two: Double Pump, Sniping, Big 1x1 sniper towers.

It’s season 2. You’re in the final 10- This may be your game! Nope, Sparkle bitches double pumping eachother while blue squires can’t do anything but hide. You sit nested in your 10 story 1x1, sneakily sniping everyone, picking them off, one by one. Until someone of course decides to do something crazy— Build up to you! A crazy idea, no one has ever dared to build before! You get one pumped with 200 health.

My rating? This season was fun, I guess, but the fact that the only way to get kills was shotgunning people really ticked me off then. Everything else was decently balanced. 3.5 Stars.

Season Three: Pump-Tac, Splodes

Double Pump is finally gone! Yes, the wait is over! You’ve never been happier about the course of the game. You leap around Fatal Fields, happy as ever, With 8 guided missiles chasing you from behind. Yay! This season was when the game blew up, And according to most people was the most balanced. To me, it wasn’t, mainly because even though double pump was gone, pump-tac was in to take over for it. Oh, and Guided fucking Missiles that drained 112 health everytime you got hit, and were so ridicuously easy to manoeuvre. The majority of the playerbase was new because the game had gotten 5x more popular, seemingly overnight.

My Rating? 2.5 Stars. Nothing at all made sense about the fact that you could sit in a box shooting controlled RPGs and kill everyone. People using RPGs as shotguns and pump-tac over double pump made this the 2nd least balanced season, at least in my opinion.

Season 4: Double Pump’s Revenge, Building.

Welp, double shotgun has lived 4 seasons now, and something had to be done. 

*Live from EPIC HQ!*

*Hey guys, i got an idea! let’s put a delay on pulling a pump out, but also allow double pumping! And, let’s nerf all shotguns so people have to double pump!*

Double pump is back, and you’re pretty much forced to use it due to the fact that one pump is obsolete and unless you use two you’re at a disadvantage. Everyone went extra try hard with their building. To me, this was the most balanced season (apart from the jet pack which to out the point of building). I was content with double pump, even though it was quite broken. 

My rating? 4 Stars. The game was really balanced, nothing too overpowered or underpowered- Patch 4.5 Balances were the most balanced, at least in my opinion. There were plenty of different playstyles, and building took off and became a ton more fun, especially with “build battles” as most people call them.

Season Five (so far- 2/5 through the season) :

Jesus christ. A P90 that shoots faster than you can build walls to protect yourself. A green drum gun that has a higher dps than a golden p90. What is going on epic. Add in a broken P90, ok. Nerf building along with it so you can’t out build it or counter it no matter what. ok. The only way around the P90 is by using another P90 against it. God help us. We’re only 4 weeks in, so i have faith, but this is getting out of hand. Shotguns were nerfed so badly in previous updates to prevent doubling them, and now doubling them is just not possible- but yet the nerfs remain- a “Run-N-Gun” playstyle is the only one supported- Especially with the fact that a Silenced SMG can be used over a AR, and is more accurate than one because the bloom on a AR is ridiculous. God help us.

My Rating? 2 Stars. SMGs or Nothin’. Building doesn’t help at all. See someone with a P90 and you don’t have one? Leave the match, you ain’t winning this. 

PS: Fuck Sony.

PPS: Something has to be done about SMGs Buff pumps. Remove switch delay, Buff damage, add a chamber to the pump. (This means the pump has a max hold of one ammo- EX:

Pump has one ammo in. You have four extra shells. You shoot the pump. You have zero ammo in the pump, but cocking the pump reloads the pump, putting one ammo in. Repeat.)

Tell me what you think, and what your opinon on most balanced season is.

Not only is it annoying to be killed simply because they had a gold scar when you had a green ar, but it would make for easier balancing when it came to any weapon, plus it could open the way up for more variety when it comes to weapons. They could easily change up the fire rates, damage, and ammo capacities of weapons without having to do so to all the weapons of its kind, plus it would give each weapon its own personalities, much like the difference between a scoped ar and thermal ar. The scoped ar is a faster fire rate, lower damage scoped weapon, where as the thermal is the harder hitting, but slower alternative. ",FortNiteBR

If someone dies by a trap placed 10 minutes ago, the person who placed it may already be dead and not get the satisfaction of seeing the kill, and the person who dies by the trap just gets frustrated, it’s typically a lose lose when the game is about having fun. I’m not saying there is a trap epidemic or that it’s ruining the game, but the only time I see a trap as a strategic addition to the game is when someone places it while building while in a fight and tries to lure the other person into it. Outside of that it’s just unnecessary. This is why I think it would be more beneficial to game strategy to have traps break after 5 minutes of being placed, and since this would be a nerf to traps you could counter that by increasing trap damage or trap reaction time.

Last time i tested KBM on Console in Fortnite was about 6 Months Ago, it felt Awfull. As someone that was really good on Pc, it was literally not Playable, because of insane input lags and other Factors like Optimized OS of Consoles. Well so i alway told People that its not that big of an Advantage, which was true back then. Some Reddit users answered that they cant feel any Input Lag at all, so i took my KBM out of my old Chest full of Gaming things, plugged them in started Fortnite hopped into a Game aannnnddd.... It felt really Good. Now, dont understand me wrong here, there still is worse Input Lag then on Pc, but its actually really small nowadays. Thats probaly because of some Optimization sides Sony and Fortnite/Epic Games. So, i hopped into my first Game and instantly got 13 Kills and win. Ive never had so much fun playing Fortnite in the last 4 Months. I mind u guys that im Playing on a PS4 Pro with an ssd inside, and using a Razer Deathadder Elite with an Razer Destructor 2 Mouspad and a Razer Ornata. Those arent Cheap Gaming Peripherie, so i cant tell if u will Experience the same. I completly Disagree with my Own Statements i made so far, KBM on Console and Fortnite Improved alot, and now is a Big Advantage on Console over Controller Players. Even tho i dont want it to get Forbidden, since its alot more fun to play Fortnite this way, but it is indeedn an Unfair Advantage on Console, and shoudln't be allowed. Its hilarious how much Optimization can do nowadays.
What do u Guys think about KBM on Console, is it fair? Should it be Forbidden? Would be Interesting to know.",FortNiteBR

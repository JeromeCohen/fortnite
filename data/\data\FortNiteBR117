I call it #AtM! The whole point of this is not to remove turrets from the game, no that would be too easy. I have come up with a fool proof plan to stop turrets, and I will use a diagram to explain it.

Lets say Player A is fighting Player B

Player A shoots Player B for 67 damage with a golden scar

Player B quickly boxes himself in to drink some minis

But then, Oh no! Player C comes out of no-where, 60m away with his turret and starts spraying his turret!

Now there are 2 ways this could go, the #AtM way, or the normal way.

In the normal way, Player A and Player C would team up on Player B and kill him! Completely unfair I know!

But what should happen, The AtM way, is first, Player A would block for Player B, Letting B heal. Then Player A and B would both grab their legendary scars and Silenced Sniper Rifle, And BOOM! Player C, the toxic player, is dead.

After this, both players would go out about 40m, And resume their fight.

So what are you waiting for, next time you see a toxic, thirdpartying player C, make sure you #AtM!",FortNiteBR

It‚Äôs so obvious to see how little they actually care for the game when they literally just copy and paste challenges from different seasons, keep allowing game breaking bugs to ruin the game for people, and only care about releasing new skins every two day. Imagine if they actually put that same effort into developing a working game that doesn‚Äôt have game breaking bugs EVERY single update. How has it been almost 7 full seasons and I‚Äôm still getting bugs from season 3? It‚Äôs embarrassing to be one of the most popular games out right now but still being unplayable sometimes. Maybe y‚Äôall should try taking pride in your work instead of trying to make another billion dollars off of little kids. ",FortNiteBR

We know the Switch isnt capable of Replays but we don't want to keep screenshoting our every win. We want to know our K/D ( kill to death reatio ).

There's a reason that people who had their dances ""stolen"" arent taking legal action. Nathan Barnatt, the guy who made boneless and the best mates guy marlon webb aren't taking legal action. They're a little upset. But they know that they wont win against epic. 

Hypothetically, Lets say that they do win the case. Those dances are now removed and they get a shit ton of money for it. Don't you think that the fortnite community would harass these people?

It‚Äôs becoming such a common strategy to get like 40 balloons and a sniper and just camp in the sky the entire game - which means that noobs can get wins by only getting one kill, the last one, or none at all if the final player dies to the storm. 
Now, I‚Äôm not complaining TOO much about a strategy that gives me free wins - wins are satisfying and give you a sense of fulfilment.

A slot that can only carry utilities such as grapplers, balloons, impulses/shockwaves(rip) and now the new upcoming glider redeploy. When you think of al the items in Fortnite Battle Royale there aren‚Äôt a ton of items you use or carry, the average load out consists of 3 weapons and 2 healing/consumable items or if you rock a sniper you will take 4 weapons and 1 for of healing. In the current state of Fortnite you pretty much have to run a shotgun with either a SMG(sub-machine gun) or a Hand-cannon so there‚Äôs 2 slots already. Then of course you‚Äôre going to carry your AR(assault rifle) so there‚Äôs another slot taken, then with the final 2 slots you are either taking a sniper rifle or heals such as mini‚Äôs, big pots, or med-kits/bandages. There‚Äôs just no space to really carry a utility item and or a explosive such as grenades, dynamite, or stink grenades. All these items just get over looked and just pass up not because they‚Äôre bad but because no one has room to take them. So I believe that a 6th item slot or a designated slot for either explosives or utility items would be a great addition and is very much needed. This wouldn‚Äôt hurt the game if anything it would bring use to more items in the game allowing Epic Games to keep introducing new items and would still keep core gameplay in check. I just can‚Äôt see a reason why not to bring a 6th slot or utility slot and I think it‚Äôs time they add it to the game. Run this post up and let‚Äôs get Epic Games to see this and hopefully make a change for the better.

When Glider Redeploy was around, there were several suggestions thrown around about how to balance it. Epic literally took every suggestion I disagreed with and ran with it, but I digress.

For the sake of transparency, I liked Glider Redeploy. I know the feelings were split, and I was on the positive side. I liked landing at Fjord Falls (I think the community calls it Viking Village) and having a safe way to get down the mountain quickly. As a rather mediocre player, what I never encountered until reading others' feedback were the downsides to Glider Redeploy: lazy building, abusable build battles, toxic third partying. So, I guess I'm trying to say, I'm not whining to have it back in unchanged; I would just like it back in some capacity.

My list of suggestions as an alternative to itemized Gliders

* Everyone has access to it, like how we used to, and how it still is (at least for now) in certain LTMs. Not an item, a mechanic.
* No charges. No limit on how many times you can use it.
* The original speed. Not the nerfed speed we currently have in certain LTMs.
* Being unable to re-enter the skydiving state was a fine nerf. Keep it.
* The Big Two
   * If you enter free fall because the structure you are standing on was destroyed, you CANNOT redeploy. If this needs to be an even stronger nerf, you should not be able to redeploy by jumping off a structure that is self-destructing.
   * Landing should have some sort of extended animation or wait time which prevents you from immediately pulling out a gun once you hit the ground. This would be to discourage third-partying.

I would love to hear feedback on this, both positive and negative. Commiseration. Insults to my intelligence. Whatever. Just to keep the conversation alive, because despite being split over Glider Redeploy, I think we feel unanimously towards itemizing it.  


TL;DR

Put Glider Redeploy back in the main game, un-itemized.  
If your build gets destroyed, you can't redeploy.  
You can't immediately pull out a weapon after landing.",FortNiteBR

I've seen so many people on this sub say something like this.  The problem is that it's simply wrong.

The rate of third partying occurances is something Epic can very much control based on game design decisions.  

Epic can...

- Make moving fast harder to do.  Reduce the amount of vehicles, launch pads, port o rifts, glider re-deploy items.  Boom.  The rate of third partying goes down.

- Make fights end quicker.  Reduce the amount of materials people have and boom, fights end quicker, third partying rates go down.

- Decrease the volume of guns by 10%.  If players don't hear fights in the distance, they won't rush to third party those fights.  Boom, the rate of third partying goes down.

Can everyone just stop saying this and realize that Epic is in complete control of how often third partying occurs in Fortnite.  I mean, if you believe they don't then you really didn't play in S1 or S2.  ",FortNiteBR

I was on the side of glider redeploy when it was first introduced. It made sense to me as a way to increase mobility, and to allow players more options to maneuver and reposition when encountering a third-partying team. I understood the arguments against it, but in my opinion its benefits outweighed the downsides. 

I was upset when it was taken out of the game, despite having support from multiple competitive players and allegedly half of the user base. But, I got over it, and now... its back! But, it‚Äôs an item now.

So here‚Äôs my plea: **please**, don‚Äôt shove it back into the game like this. I don‚Äôt want to effectively lose a slot in order to keep up with every other team. The benefits of redeploy essentially force you to take this item if you don‚Äôt have it, and it lowers the rate of useful items like shields dropping from chests. I‚Äôd rather not have the mechanic at all than have this iteration of it. My solution at the time was to increase the deploy height so as to enable fall damage (i.e. three stories to 5-6 stories), but if there is not a reasonable way to implement it, it shouldn‚Äôt be in the game.

I believe that there are already enough ways to traverse the map, or rather, there was. We had shopping carts, golf carts, ATVs, launch pads, rifts around the map, and even rifts on the go. Hell, we even got zip-lines.

When we got glider redeployment, at first, I was elated. No more needing to run around the map hoping to get an item to traverse faster. However, I slowly began to realize that every time I got into a fight, more and more teams would pile up onto that spot because they heard shooting. Third, fourth, and even fifth partying became the norm, and you couldn't do anything about it. Basically, you're punished if you're going for kills because you're likely to get jumped. People also built giant staircases all over the map just because they could without having any repercussions.

Then came planes. Planes were fun at first as well, but as time went on, you can begin to realize it's flaws. Not only do you get a turret, but if you're in squads, you have 3 more people able to shoot at a spot and all jump out and destroy you just by landing on top of you while you're in a fight. Couple this with boomboxes, dynamite, and planes with the occasional rocket launcher and grenade launcher, and building no longer is the strong suit of the game called ""Fortnite"". 

With itemized glider redeployment, were going to see those giant staircases again, we're going to see third partying more often (as if it wasn't bad enough already) and the storm will be even less of a threat than it already was, which wasn't enough to begin with.

It's just saddening to see a game that was fun for the building, get completely changed around to favor those who can't. I can see why players who aren't as good at building would be happy with changes like these, but you've got to see it from our point of view, aswell.

Who else thinks the scoped ARs are a bit bent when they shoot? I have it on point, crosshair on the body, somehow misses completely. Me and the opponent and still,still miss when it shouldn‚Äôt (within 250m by the way!)

Bullets going through people, arrows not spawning in in big team modes, just mayhem. I hope people working at epic can see this, I wanna see what everyone else thinks.

We both came to the conclusion that the experience of getting third partied isn't fun.  The game is at it's peak when you're squaring off with you an another player/team.  

Fights last a long time.  Both parties jockey for position. Expend resources.  Then a winner emerges.

When you get 3rd partied 20 or 30 seconds into a fight it just feels random and bad.  It feels like you're playing a 1 on 1 basketball match and during a possession some random person runs on to the court and takes the ball.

There should be a tier system based on how many v-bucks you‚Äôve spent that give you in-game weapon/item/building perks. The tiers would be color coded from white, all the way to platinum. 

Some perks of the higher levels would be things like start all games with 3 gold weapons, and heals. You could customize your perks based on your tier level for more mats or full ammo.

Some of you may think that this is pay to win, but if you take an intellectual approach it‚Äôs actually pay-so-other-people-can-keep-playing. Without v-bucks Epic would literally have like no money. Players like me who have spent hundreds are keeping Epic alive... this means people who don‚Äôt buy skins can still play without having to buy v-bucks. 

If Fortnite wants to actually do something good for its most loyal players it should implement this soon.  Otherwise, I‚Äôm taking my parents money elsewhere.

Fire God

Water Warrior

Earth Emperor

Snow Snapper (Scuffed name i know)

Elemental Leader ( tier 100)

In the end its another thing that people would want to work towards, and thats being as good as they can be to get the highest possible rank. Thats how i was with cs:go at least",FortNiteBR

Can this community even research the topics of the complaint they're making or wonder how this thing will work like instead of just hating?
I just say it cus:

1-Can't you wait till the thing is released to hate it? 
2-Weapon and healing/utility are different pools with different chances on chest. 
AND
3-The fixing and the adding stuff people work in two different teams, they can't stop adding and focusing on fixing because of that!

SOLUTION: Have a 10 seconds cooldown when you are knocked so that you can't get greeded and that your teammates can try and save you from your fate (spectator mode). The 10 second cooldown will start after the first stormcircle has passed (early thirst is understandable due to lack of recourses and weapons).

Ofc, I‚Äôm always trying to get better and what not with everything but building or out dueling someone or even getting that victory royale  isn‚Äôt really what I play fortnite for(since getting one is so rare for me lol). I couldn‚Äôt care less about that. I find fun playing this game as a stealthy assassin. 

 If I have a suppressed load out(sniper is a must) a grapple and a bush, I can really play this playstyle. However I struggle a little in the endgame and was just curious if anyone who plays this way or have played other stealth games have any tips on playing stealthy.

I hand cannoned my way into his 1 by 1 and placed a trap. I did 150 damage to what I assumed to be a full house player. He scurried away and hopped on to a zipline that carried him to a parallel mountain. As he was fading into the distance I sprayed a whole clip of my purple scar in his direction. All 30 of my shots, in which my crosshair was directly on him, missed horribly. He then turned around and one tapped me in the head with a bolt... I screamed. It was then that I thought of the idea of a bloom mechanic where the longer you spray the more accurate your bullets become. In other games it is know as the glass half full perk. First shot accuracy is great don't get me wrong, but when you can't hit a shot without it, it makes no difference. If I have the time to spray at someone for 20 seconds, I should be able to eliminate him.  In most fights you take the opening shot for the suprise damage and they build. If you can manage to find someone who is not building, glass half full mechanic will help you teach him a lesson on how to play fortnite. The game will reward higher skill players, make aim more important than building, and make the game more consistent overall. Please consider this, it would please everyone in the community. Feel free to comment suggestions to build upon this idea, and refine it into a working game mechanic.",FortNiteBR

Now, in Season 7, it all changed. This season made me decide to quit Fortnite altogether and go back the CS:GO, who I've quit because of its repetitiveness.

Today alone, I've played 23 matches. 4 of which I've died to a rocket launcher, 2 of which I've died to a minigun, and 5 of which I've died to a boom-box. Epic, why the hell is adding a SCOPED REVOLVER... more important than fixing the game..? I know everyone I play with is fed up with Epic. This game used to be fun, now it's just frustrating. I don't consider myself a tryhard because I don't really care when I die, it's when I die to stupid stuff Fortnite has added.. It just baffles me to think that Epic Games isn't listening to the pros or influencers in Fortnite. I know many other popular players like Ninja feel the same way about the game. Ever since they added the turret, the game went downhill drastically.

 I have posted about problems in Fortnite before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ace4tr/issues\_with\_fortnites\_meta\_and\_proposed\_solutions/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ace4tr/issues_with_fortnites_meta_and_proposed_solutions/)

&amp;#x200B;

***Rocket launchers and miniguns are still in the game??***

***Planes still have turrets?***

***and scoped revolvers..?***

Listen to the pros. Vault the minigun, and rocket launchers.. PLEASE. AND the turret for the plane. The Unvaulted LTM has been the best thing Fortnite has done in many, many seasons; not because of the stuff that are unvaulted, but because of the items that were removed. The first game of Unvaulted I played, I won with 21 kills. Solo squad. I didn't even pick up a suppressed, or tactical SMG, or a blue rocket launcher, etc. I used a SCAR, and a pump. The last time I played a regular solo with 20+ kills was season 6 (I believe.)

&amp;#x200B;

I know Epic Games won't listen. That's why I'm quitting the game. It's very sad, actually. I've had so much fun playing, even last season. I don't know how they manage to mess up the game in the span of a month.  Someday I'll look at this game and remember how much fun I had.. that is until season 7. Hope it gets better in the future and becomes more playable. ",FortNiteBR

those are my favorite game modes, even more than normal BR modes (yes, i'm probably a casual player for saying that), and i've saw MANY posts here about making respawns LTMs permanent (mostly for Team Rumble, but it hink both Disco Domination and Food Fight deserves a chance too, even when they're not as fun as Team Rumble lol), so why not keep that rotating playlist permanently in the game?

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, it would still be considered limited time modes, since you can play a mode for 3 days, then wait a whole week to see it back, even when it could split the playerbase across all game modes, i think there should be both a Casual playlist, and a Pro playlist, most casual players only care about practice to get some kills, level up and unlock stuff for their battle passes (i consider myself guilty about this too), and the pro players care about winning and keep good stats every season, those can entirely focus on the basic modes (solo, duos and squads), while the casuals can play a different mode where they feel more comfortable, so that could be a good solution in my opinion to keep both the casual and the professional playerbase happy :)",FortNiteBR

I'm sorry but this needs to be said, especially after the shotgun buffs. 

We are only supposed to be queued with people that have mouse/keyboard, but I consistently get put into games with console players, or PC players with a controller. 

I know playing with a controller is harder than mouse/keyboard. I used to play a lot of different FPS games on XBOX, aim assist is necessary.

What I don't agree with is aim assist on PC. You're telling me that out of dozens of millions PC players, and millions of active players on the east coast at all hours of every day, that I should be going against console players or controller players? 

With this meta, and everyone turtle builds, and people still phase through, its not that hard for console/controller players to get off shots even if you out build them. 

I'm truly getting sick and tired of being railed for 150+ by a controller player. There is no reason for it. 

I even tested this theory with my buddy who is an XBOX player, queued into solos, out of 10x, he got into the same game as me 4x. 

I have nothing against console, nothing against aim assist, I'm not trying to flame that community. 

But I can't be the only one who is tired of getting 1 pump'd by controller players because they ADS on every shot.

Bronze: 1-1000

Silver: 1001-2000

Gold: 2001-3000

Platinum: 3001-4000

Diamond: 4001-5000

Elite: 5001-6000

Top 500: 6001-IDK

I would like the elo ranks to be simple to understand for newer players and give competitive players a reason to play this consistently.

Decay would start at diamond. You have to play 1 match every 3 days to avoid decay. Each day after the 3 days will drop your elo 10 points until you are at the lowest of your rank. Top 500 players will decay to the bottom of Elite. For placements, your TEAM has to be in that place when all of you are eliminated to get the points earned.

Gaining elo would be like this:

Placement: 20-10 - 5 points   9-4 - 6 points   3rd place - 7 points   2nd place - 8   1st - 10

Kills: You will not gain elo until you have 3 kills minimum. Every kill after 3 will count for 1 point.

Wins: 5 points per win on top of the 10 for 1st place.

Every match will always have 100 players. The modes will be Solo, Duo, Trios, Squad. The Trios mode will max out at 99 players in a single lobby. For placement matches, you have to win 5 games to be placed. You can only win 1 game per 12 hours during placement matches. Seasons will last as long as regular battle pass ones do. Your elo resets every season, but you will be placed similarly to what you ENDED at last season. Long term challenges will be in place to earn skins, edit styles for skins, pickaxes, gliders, trails, emotes, wraps, and even v-bucks.

A system similar to Overwatch's where players can earn wraps for weapons will also be here. Each win you receive, you will gain 50 wrap points ( I will just call them wrap points for now until I can figure out a name ).

There will be 3 wraps:

Gold (5000)

Platinum (7500)

Diamond (10000)

For Duos and Squads, you can only play with people within your rank. 

How you LOSE elo:

Placement: 100-75: - 10 points    74-50: -8 points    49-21: - 5 points

Kills: 0: -10 points    1: -8 points    2: -5 points

Each loss will also decrease your elo by 3.

No fill/fill will be turned off for this mode. You must have the a full duo/trios/squad to play in these modes (similar to the pop-up cups).

Now, the most important part will be the gameplay. It will be very different than casual. In your settings, you will create a standard loadout you will spawn with no matter what. Your choices are: 3 minis, 1 half pot, a medkit, a gray AR, a gray SMG, and  a gray tac/green pump.

The following changes will also be implemented:

VAULTED - regular pistols, balloons, turrets, planes, grapplers, boomboxes, rocket launchers, quad launchers, grenade launchers, minigun, compact SMG, suppressed pistols, bursts, port a fortresses, dynamite, bushes.

NERFS - Traps do 125 damage. Heavy sniper body damage down to 125, deagle cannot 1 shot freshly placed metal or brick.

Let me know what you think! This is just a rough draft. Lastly, mat cap is 750 for everything.

Would love to hear Epics oppinion about this feature and if we can excect something like this in the future?",FortNiteBR

I closed Fortnite in the middle of the game and it took like 5 seconds for the sound to go away. It freaked me out and the person I was playing with didn‚Äôt hear it, but that was most likely due to her game + voice chat sound being off. Today the same happened to me, I was alone on the lobby and I start hearing this kid talking in a foreign language with someone. I closed the game and opened the sound mixer and it was coming from Fortnite. Once again, it took about 5 seconds to disappear. About 3 hours later, it happened for a third time. I was playing on creative only with my sister, on her server. We were alone. This time I heard the sound of the default dance (like when someone‚Äôs playing without headphones and you hear what they hear) and a kid talking. I didn‚Äôt close the game and opened the sound mixer and it was indeed coming from Fortnite. It went away after 2 minutes while I just kept playing. I looked it up and found only like 3 other posts with the same experience, saying it might be a problem with the voice servers or the modem.

The Paradox (Male) skin also on his coat has a goose with a red eye that could hint the Eye Of Ra which is similarly connected to Egyptian History.

&amp;#x200B;

Google specifically auto corrects Ouroboros into Borobudur which is the worlds biggest Buddhist temple that doesn't really connect to Egypt but I thought I would include it.

&amp;#x200B;

The Lace (Female) skins back-bling (Stitches) has some linen cloth covering its right eye with could somehow lead to mummy's in Egypt (I am going by any interesting details to the set, anything)

&amp;#x200B;

The Paradox (Male) skins back-bling looks to be some sort of Tomb or Coffin usually containing Egyptian kings/queens, and ironically its named Eternal.

People always say that ""Aydan was destroying Nick in the skirmish. Aydan's the better player!"" but if you look over the fights, Aydan had the most amazing luck ever. Aydan in every single fight had max shield, and continuously got shield when hit low on health. Whilst Nick struggled to find a small pot. Aydan also had explosives handy and stink bombs for the upper hand. Nick played those situations extremely well, but Aydan's luck when it came to loot couldn't be deal with.

I think Aydan's kills on Nick were impressive, but very overrated with the way the game was set out for Aydan.

Also, NICKMERCS is someone who I've learnt so  much from. I learn more from Nick then I do watching Tfue or Ninja because he's a Console player with average building mechanics, but amazing game sense and awareness. 
As a console player, i can't learn much from watching Tfue or Ninja, because some of the flicks, and things they can do with a KBM would be impossible for a controller.  So watching someone who knows every in and out, every escape route, every little thing about the game, is more helpful than watching someone who can do an 18 layer ramp rush, and then instantly flick their mouse and no-scope someone from 236m away.

Sorry for my C Grade English, hopefully I conveyed my point half decently.

Right now, the only OG skins that have no chance of returning are the Season 2 battlepass skins. The Season 1 shop skins are said to be returning sometime in the future, so these will no longer be OG.

Between rifts, vehicles, ziplines, launchpads, and balloons traveling has never been easier in Fortnite. Which sounds convenient, but comes with game breaking problems. 

For one thing the storm is just not a threat anymore to anyone paying attention. What was once just as much of a threat as other players is now just an arbitrary nuisance. The storm is only dangerous late game when it damages your health more severely. 

Another thing is the flow of matches. Now that players can traverse the map so easily everyone is dying too quickly. The good players suck up all of the action, and everyone else barely sees anyone the whole game afterwards. This creates a disparity and matches feel very lonely/uneven. 

Rewind to season 4 and pre-season 4. We had hop rocks. That was the extent of mobility items in Fortnite. I don't want to sound like I'm some OG cause I'm not, but I was playing back then and it felt much different. Matches felt more populated and slow paced. The storm was a legit threat. And it was less likely to get 3rd partied unfairly. 

Fortnite feels much different than when it began. And enhanced mobility is the reason why. Epic Games has overplayed their hand with it in my opinion and need to roll it back greatly. 

But look this is meant to be a discussion what do you think of mobility in Fortnite. Do you love it do you hate it? Do you miss running simulator 2018? Let me know I'm curious what everyone thinks.

Which shows a lot about what the community believes would fix the game.  
Unvaulted - was probably one of the most active limited time game modes from the 14 days. I believe this because there is no vehicles or super overpowered weapons within the gamemode.  
Sniper shoot out - Because who doesn't love sniping someone from 180 meters away and dinging them for a headshot!  
Siphon - because you are rewarded more for your ability to play the game, however, maybe rewarded too much for a regular lobby.   


Now here is how I would combine some idea's and make Fortnite even better in my own opinion.  
1) Get rid of all vehicles in the game that can easily break structures. Planes and Quad crashers, I would keep shopping carts and golf carts only.  
2) Vault balloons, turrets, grapplers, boomboxes, and the P90  
3) Bring back tac sub, silenced smg (rare and legendary rarity so the regular smg is finished), bouncers (in stacks of 1 or 2)

4) Reward kills with 25 hp or shield if hp is 100   
5) Make launch pads more common as it was in unvaulted more mobility around the map instead of glider redeploy  
6) Give people who have earned x amount of total wins some sort of achievement to be wearable in game to show their commitment to the game and time dedicated  


  


Thank you for reading this and any other idea's would be greatly appreciated and would love to hear them!

We currently have the Stormwing, Quad Crasher, ATK, Rifts, Ziplines, Shopping carts, Grappler, Balloons, Rift-To-Go, Launch pads.  Coming from a OG players who's been playing since the start, I oppose soo many methods of travel. It takes out the sense of learning the map an awareness, it takes away many players dying to storm, it make rotation easy for noobs. As a player who loves the game an gets excited for new items, I loved it alot more without all the modes of transportation, it was more of an adventure and a struggle that paid off for the Victory Royale. What I'm proposing is LEAVING in Quad crashers, Rifts, Rift-To-Gos   Grappler an Launch pads and bringing back Bounce pads. That is more then enough modes of transportation. Especially since once a player is SKILLED enough they can basically fly with the Quad Crasher! It's just my opinion an I'd like some feedback from the community.

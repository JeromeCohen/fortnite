It really saturates and decreases the satisfaction of earning the rewards. It happened with John Wick. In my opinion, I think Epic should introduce challenges that reward skill and dedication towards the game. It would allow players to truly be able to have an achievement that they actually worked hard for and that is not easily achievable by every casual player that plays the game. For example: I think the Level 80 Omega lights is a step in the right direction as the grind for it is real.

You could give them a new glider for reaching level 80, similar to season 3, where you did extra challenges for an item, but the end reward for the battle pass was a complete skin.

Adding an upgradeable skin as the final reward, but then making that reward practically unattainable for many people is a really bad idea, and I hope the season 5 rewards will be better thought out.",FortNiteBR

It may seem picky, but disorganization of items can lose you a split second in a fight. 

My suggestion is to give the ability to hold ""nothing"" - essentially bare hands - in empty slots of your inventory. Picking up an inventory with your ""bare hands"" puts the item in that slot (similar to how it works in minecraft). ",FortNiteBR

Changes that'll make the game greater than it is now.,"Anyone else remember the guilded missile? Maybe smoke grenades or even crossbows? I think they all should be brought back but changed of course.

Guilded missile - This was like my favorite weapon of all time because the thought of being able to control to backup your friends during squads was awesome! I enjoyed it for the short time it was here and I'm sure many of the other players who knew how to counter it did as well. I think we should bring this weapon back but with a fee changes since people will still cry and say that it was op. With you now being able to hold only a limited amount of rocks this is the perfect time to bring them back! First I think that they should do only 75 damage that way it'll take three hits to kill an enemy rather than two so people won't say that it's op, secondly I think they should only be available in supply drops so that a ton of people don't have them, and lastly I think the missles should have only 50 health to be shot down which would also decrease the amount of players that say it's op. It was a game changing weapon and I would love for it to come back!!

Smoke grenades - I know not many people used these weapons much but they were most definitely useful!! I used them to revive my teammates that were knocked or just to surprise an opponent. Along with the thermal scoped assault rival they would be awesome to have back! As long as you don't make the spawn rates too high.

Crossbows - It was a little aggrivating walking into a building and getting a crossbow rather than a shotgun so if you had these back please decrease the spawn rates by a million. Anyway, I think a new exploding crossbow would be nice. Maybe they're the same as a regular cross except if you had explosives in your inventory (grenades, c4's, stickies) it uses one that you can shoot using the crossbow. I just like the idea of having a weapon that didn't run out of ammo. It definitely needed a buff and the only other problem was that they spawned alot when they were here.

Other issues - Shots aren't registering, with the nerf to the pumps I think that you should increase the speed of double pump maybe back to the original, people jumping through walls (I know you guys did this so that we're able to build through trees but I'm sure you can find some way to fix it so that players can't jump through solid walls.), We need more mats honestly because farming takes up alot of the game and If not I'd like to see blitz be up as long as 50's was, and lastly we're still waiting on that playground mode 👀.

Last week, the Risky Reels challenge had 20-30 people dropping at it for 3-4 days. Pair this with the Shifty Shaft elimination challenge, there were 10-15 people left before the first circle closed in. I had games with 8 people left before the first circle. I just got off after seeing that. Now this week there is a Salty/Pleasant challenge, and again 15-20 people are left before the first circle closes.

Furthermore, people are taking to Squads and LTM modes to do these challenges. Theres more solos in squads than actual squads. 50vs50 was completely ruined all of last week because people just quit if they didn't get the bus route over Risky Reels. People are going to different servers in other countries trying to finish these challenges, forcing natives to play against people with 200+ ping.

This is 100% not because I want it, it just makes good business sense. If you disagree then youre a virgin loser with a tiny weiner.

Also, the game is too RNG based, because I lose a lot and its obviously not me. We need to remove bloom and copy every single mechanic from PUBG so I don't have to face the fact that I cant build or aim. Speaking of building, the material nerf is fine so stop whining, otherwise I might have to learn to build.

Lastly, I think the best thing to do to fix the game is to give me level 80 because I dont want to grind for it and it feels bad that someone has something I dont. Instead of having basic adult coping skills, EPIC needs to cater to my thinly veiled tantrum and childish demands for free stuff.

I have read a lot of people writing back and forth on how bad the grind is to unlock the full Omega skin. So I figured. Why not just post our stats and level?

I don't want to advertise any specific stat websites, so I'll just post the average of two that I know of since the numbers vary a little.

I'll begin:

Level: 70

It just does. It’s simply more competitive, people actually fight on PC, they don’t sit back and snipe everyone the entire game. I have run into a recurring issue however, and it’s not the cherry picking I’ve been experiencing. The problem is building. More importantly, **why console players don’t build**. It’s something I think I’ll never understand. I had a 1v1 today. I was 9 kills deep. I saw the man, a sole John Wick in greasy grove. I thought man this is it, I’ll have a great build off with this guy, show him that I am the upper man. I push using my double stairs, he builds a 1 by 1 and continues to build up. I easily overtake him with high ground and am waiting at the top for his next move. Suddenly I hear a noise of the wood below me breaking, and I plummet to my death. I spectate mr John Wick, **1 Kill**. He then proceeded to orange Justice on me. So, to any console player out there, if someone wants to build off with you, pllleaasee just try. Even if you die it shows you tried to make the game fun and fair. Do not shoot us down, it ruins the fun. I’m begging you. Thank you and god bless.",FortNiteBR

So, similar to my previous events, I want this one to be grand. If you guys want to see what the community can pull off again, please help us out by upvoting this post. I’d like to keep these events exclusive to the reddit community of this game as it isn’t as toxic and we’ve pulled of some great things before. Read below for all the details on this event &amp; as this is our first official *Community Drop Night* This all for us to have a good time and have some fun as a community :)

**The Great Wall of Sprays**

**Landing Location**: *Wailing Woods*

**Queueing Server/Mode**: *Oceania* (Solos)

**Queueing Time(s)**: 8 PM *Pacific Time* + Every twenty minutes after up until 9PM Pacific (8, 8:20, 8:40,) so it’ll be three different waves.

**Platform**: Once again, this event will be across *all* platforms

**Objective**: We’re going to destroy every single tree at Wailing Woods. Once every tree in the general location is gone, we’ll start building a *massive* wall (it can start anywhere, but every wall piece has to be connected). Absolutely *no* outlying wall pieces, connect every piece so it looks like a massive wall and *not* a maze. The wall will only be one unit high, not two, not three, *one*. Once we have a decent sized wall, every single person in the lobby will start spray painting any choice of spray onto the wall, so that it looks like a huge graffiti wall. You only have the ability to use three sprays, so use them wisely ;)

**Rules**:

Shooting is once again, *not* allowed.

If anyone does start shooting; griefing or trolling the event, immediately charge &amp; execute them by working together and pickaxing them.

Absolutely *no* griefing by building. This includes building pyramids/floors/stairs that have absolutely no correlation to the event. Please, to make the experience for everyone, do *not* build anything besides the wall.

No destroying of the wall, we want it to go fast so we can spray paint it ASAP.

**Participation Requirements**: 

Because you need to have the battle pass in order to have sprays, every person participating will already have the Carbide skin. Equip the Carbide Skin with any back bling/glider/pickaxe. All you need to have equipped is the Carbide skin so that we can tell who the players who are participating are.

And that’s it for the rules! If you want to see this all unfold, please upvote this post so that we can make it happen and get as much people attending the event as possible. We have exactly 24 Hours after this post goes up to get as much upvotes as possible so we can have as much attendance as possible.

I *will* be streaming this as I always do on my Twitch for everyone who wants to watch it all go down. Fortnite Reddit Community, let’s get it done!

Head on over to my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/xsqoof?lang=en) bio for a link to join the Official Discord for the events! (@xsqoof). You can also share your thoughts and feedback on the times/planning of the events in my [Twitch](https://m.twitch.tv/sqoof) chat when I go live as I’m really interactive with chat as well. Thank you all for reading, and once again, let’s get this noticed!

How to fix this

1: Make every single gun have a recoil pattern that is consistent (Constantly up, constantly up a bit to the side, etc)

2: Make RPGs, Shield potions (Only the halves) Chug Jugs, Scars, Snipers, and Heavy Shotguns airdrop only

3: Get rid of stupid shotgun combos, I'd say Pump/Heavy to Tac is the only exception

4: Get rid of skill based matchmaking, it has made it much harder to get high kill games without it.

5: Add more casual modes.

They continually make the wrong choice and push for new content instead of fixing fundamental issues with gameplay. For example, I have been unable to fix my sensitivity issues AT ALL. I CANNOT PLAY THE GOD DAMN GAME IF MY SENSITIVITY AUTOSAVES AT 7 EVERY TIME AND DOESN’T LET ME CHANGE IT. If this were an isolated instance, I wouldn’t be mad, but unfortunately this follows a clear trend in the game: quantity over quality. 

Epic is a company that has historically run their games into the ground. Paragon was a promising competitor to modern MMOBA’s like LOL and DOTA, but their continuous changes to gameplay and the meta (striving to keep the player base interested with new content, sound familiar?) rendered the game completely unplayable. This company got really lucky with a game that appealed to a widespread audience, but I swear to god they are trying their hardest to ruin it. 

The fact that a billion+ dollar game has the worst player support infrastructure and I have to wait weeks to receive any kind of support for anything is atrocious. Notice how the only thing these people listen to is skin or cosmetic suggestions and not gameplay/mechanical conventions? I swear, if they release another stink bomb type thing before they fix issues that have pissed everyone off for months, I’m going to quit.

B. Land in tilted towers and hope for the best. I don't like landing here cause its basically a war-zone where you can very easily die the second you hit the ground

There is no strategy to survive, there is no real thinking to do....Honestly I'm not even really whining. If anything I've gotten to the stage where I'm like. What's the point? Why even bother?

  
I'm just trying to see if i got this right. Are my only options to beat everyone at their own game or just uninstall and find something else?",FortNiteBR

This is going to be a decently long post, so if you dont wanna read it, now is the best time to turn around. Also, just as a note, there are going to be things i bring up about my life personally, i am only doing so to give context to things, and my playtime as a whole.

I myself have been on disability, going through treatment for a bone marrow disorder, for almost a year now, and it has pretty much made it where i am home 90 percent of my time. Gaming has always been a big aspect of my life, so i have spent most of my free time playing video games, Fortnite being the main game since about mid October. I have got every battle pass, and maxed it every season without worry, or fatigue of the exp grind. I have always been more of a solo's guy, with the occasional matches with friends here and there when they have the time. My play time has been pretty consistent over the seasons, give or take a few days here and there. Now seeing as i have all the free time, i can see where people who don't would have a hard time getting to lvl 80, it is just a timegate. You can get it earlier if you are skilled yes, but at the end of the day, if you have the time you can still easily reach lvl 80. Hell im only lvl 70 at this point with all my time, yes i will still get it, but it has just taken more time then any of the other season's. By now i usually was around 80, and that as about the point i felt the exp slowed down significantly, but this season, i felt the exp slowed down immensely at lvl 65. Ultimately, i don't feel the battlepass is where skilled players should be getting exclusive rewards, or time gates should be a thing, im not saying hand everyone everything, but i feel if you want to give good players something to earn and be proud of, make it an over all season thing, that from day one they can start working towards, like 100 wins, or something like the Blockbuster challenges just on a different scale.In the end, by putting a time gate, or making people feel like the Levels are some massive grind, people are going to reconsider buying next seasons battlepass.. People that i know, that had no issue last season hitting 80 are now feeling like the exp is slowed, and like Epic is adding all this to give incentive  to buying battle pass levels early for those exp boosts, which, can you really blame them for feeling that way? I know people want rewards to feel challenging, but For a lot of people, the battle pass is the one thing they normally use to support the game, and by making it harder to achieve the end goal, you are making it less likely that people are going to purchase..

I'm pretty confident the majority of the people here and on the game enjoy their games as intended. And we all have one thing in common: game functionnalities (here, the shopping carts) are taken away from us because of a minority abusing glitches.

This post's goal is simple. The number of upvotes is the minimum number of people who want Epic to be more aggressive toward people abusing those glitches. They have nothing to do here anyway.

When I say aggressive, i mean it. Like, automated ban system.

""Uh you're out of accessible areas once, it happens, warning.""

""Twice in a row uh? 1 day ban.""

""Already banned once and you keep doing it? 1 week ban.""

That way, Epic doesn't have to disable something that works perfectly when used as intended. We get to enjoy our carts or other features. 

False positive might happen, but i'm very confident people will be careful after a warning. And how many people ended up out of the map without trying to get there anyway?

And, to not kill customer support, those bans should only be temporary and last in CS's priority queue. 

TL;DR: Epic should ban glitch abusers and not disable something working as intended if not abused.",FortNiteBR

1. In squads you can get carried and have teammates to help you out.
2. The general quality of players in squads is lower.
3. Solo’s has tougher clusterfucks to deal with
4. You have to outbuild people in solos, while in squads you either don’t have to or your teammates do it for you

So the next Season rolls around and Epic provides a reward that's achievable, but requires commitment to the grind. Level 80. And now we have a flood of posts telling Epic it's too hard... and they should make it so that everyone can earn the reward.

We can't have it both ways. No matter what difficult challenge is derived to generate a cosmetic reward, it will be earned too often in the opinion of the sweatiest players... and too hard to get in the opinion of the casual player.",FortNiteBR

There’s very little incentive to play solo, but it’s really unfortunate when your friends are hardly on when you are on, so the XP boosts don’t happen as much. 

The other thing is, the amount of XP gained from challenges, as well as the amount of challenges available is honestly a bother. 500 xp doesn’t really get you anywhere from a daily challenge, and once you finish weekly and daily challenges, it’s boring grind and when you play the game without breaks in ways to earn the most XP by playing every match the same instead of how you want to, the game starts to burn you out. The challenges aren’t giving me enough incentive to complete them. Finishing them doesn’t fulfill me. I play this game very often, and I realistically can get to Omega, but I just don’t want to play this game for hours and hours every day.

To improve challenges, and give people fulfilling reasons to seek certain challenges out, there should be challenge tiers that rotate daily. Give us normal 500 XP challenges, two per day, and also include harder challenges with varying XP. Maybe 5 headshot elims in a game, 1k XP, 10 elims in a match, 2k, that stuff. It encourages people to play in different ways AND rewards you fairly

Basically: Solo XP and XP Gained in general in this game is low. There should be more daily challenges, higher XP challenges, as well as an increase in XP gained solo or just a tad bit more in groups. ",FortNiteBR

This post is not meant for me, it’s meant for other people:

-	People who can’t get the amount of XP in time. 532,500 is a lot. Some people have other shit that comes first. Personally I’m a fan of it, I kind of like the grind and I’m lucky enough to have time for it. 
-	People who feel as if the BP should give all the rewards through it’s actual expected amount of time to complete (didn’t it say 75 hours? Omega takes so much longer).
-	People who don’t think XP is a good enough skill check for reward. I agree. You can play 2000 matches and still get Omega. 

So, what do y’all think about rewards based on wins, Battlepass or no Battlepass. Everyone gets a chance, and you don’t have to spend money. Maybe a character with three tiers, or just 3 different characters that must be earned throughout the season:

-	50 wins: character unlocked.
-	150 wins: character tier 2 unlocked. 
-	300 wins: character tier 3 unlocked. 

This would show off the really *hardcore* players who dedicate a lot of time to this game and deserve something for it. It’s unable to be affected by XP, so buying the BP from day 1 doesn’t help you like it did this season. It also allows a more casual but still good player to earn something. Personally I would never be able to hit 300 wins in a season, but I know there are people who can and they deserve something for that insane kind of dedication and skill. (It doesn’t have to be these numbers, I’m just spitballing here)

Wins could be replaced with kills, snipes, splodes, smg kills, etc etc. Just something else besides the huge amount of XP required. 

TL;DR - replace XP with something else, allow it to be unlocked by free and Battlepass owners, but make the last unlockable *really fucking hard.* You have to play well to get that shit. ",FortNiteBR

So in save the world version of fortnite vindertech extracts blu glo from the hop rocks and meteor shards to fuel things.(Vindertech is the government basically) In battle royale all the cars and pick up trucks have the vindertech logo and are transporting all the hop rocks and meteor shards to the villain base so that Omen and “The Visitor” can extract blu glo from them and fuel the rocket!

My next theory is that Omega could be secretly helping the bad guys by building the army of diecasts and chroniums. Everyone should know by now that they have the vindertech logo on them so what if the meteor shards were used to build a load of diecasts and chroniums!!

Remember the UFO from season 3? That is going to destroy 80% of Tilted Towers. The rocket? Well that is supposed  to hit Tilted Towers but the superheroes are going to change its direction to hit a not really populated place. Moisty Mire

quick maths:
&gt;Level 80 requires 532.250 exp

&gt;You get 35.000 exp from all the weekly challenges and 35.000 exp from the dailies.

&gt;532.250-70.000 leaves you with 462.250 exp you still need to earn by playing the game.

&gt;Placing #1 with 6 kills earns you about 1.550 exp (keep in mind that I'm calculating in epics favour, because obviously at the start of the season you won't have that sweet 120% exp bonus you have aquired til now.

&gt;Due to storm circles shrinking, games typically last the same amount of time. Calculating in epics favour again; the fastest games take about 26-27 minutes. Adding queue and loading time, we're easily at 30.

&gt;1.550 exp per 30 minutes

&gt;1.550*2 makes 3100 exp per hour.

&gt;462.250/3100 equals approximately 149 hours.

But the worst thing is the grind it takes to reach level 80 to fully unlock Omega's armor.
At first I liked that this time it's not gonna be possible to simply buy the full Tier 100 skin and that it's not gonna be as common as John Wick used to be last season. But in the end everyone who instantly bought it also bought the 120% XP boost + bonus XP for everything so it's no difference.
Moreover I'd be fine with the level 80 armor if it was somehow binded to skill. But I got many friends who have 100+ wins this season and a good win ratio and still won't reach level 80 because they are too far away from it anyways.

My suggestion for next season is a more individual Battlepass that you level up similar to skill trees in some games. I also hope there will finally be something that actually rewards wins or kills.

So let’s look at the pros and cons of this: 


Pros:

-People could easily trade skins for other skins, V-Bucks, etc.

- Buying accounts would no longer be very necessary as people would be able to trade for their desired skins rather having to buy whole new accounts (which are usually scams anyway).

- V-Buck giveaways could actually be done directly in-game.

Cons:

-some more scams could arise where people are requesting real money for their skins, then just don’t trade the items.


&amp;nbsp;

Epic is clearly aware of all the scams that go in with buying accounts, and this (in my opinion) would at least somewhat reduce it, while allowing more freedom for people trading skins and other items. Can you guys think of any reason Epic does not want to add it, aside from scams involving trading? 

Note: I don’t think this is an absolute necessity for the game but it would be nice to be able to get that one skin or axe you’ve always wanted.

1. Console lag needs to be fixed as it has been since 4.1 (although it had been increasingly worse with successive patches. Ex: used to be just as you died, now can occur more frequently, sometimes in the middle of a fight.
2. Shotgun consistency they said they would work on it, and nothing has been done. Hitting 8s with my muzzle down someone's throat little absurd.
3. Phasing through others structures as well as your own, this issue has been more and more annoying as this hasn't been fixed and has caused me to lose top 10 games. And it isn't my connection it happens to streamers. If it has to do with latency, I don't think it is on my end.
4. Server latency? As this seasons patches have rolled out I have had several more issues with individuals having very weak connection and somehow gaining an advantage from such. Along with more hitmarkers on players who build something, neither the less damage doesn't occur and having poor connection should not provide an edge.

I may just be irritated with the game lately and issues that should be resolved that haven't.

But I think that Epic is at least trying to address this. With the replacement of Dusty Depot with Dusty Divot, I think Epic has a strategy for the upcoming seasons.

Epic is going buff the the other POI's rather than nerf Tilted. With the current situation of the missile, I think that we can expect one of the POI's to be buffed.

The two leading theories for season 5 is the removal of Moisty and the removal of Wailing. These are two of the least commonly visited POI's. Perhaps Epic will take a similar route with what they did with Dusty. They are going to buff one of these locations and attract people to the spot.

Personally, I feel like adding more POI's is a mistake. At this point, it will only spread people out even more. For example, the addition of Risky Reels did in fact attract more people, but it also took people away from Tomato Town, Wailing Woods, and Anarchy Acres. This is not what Epic should be doing.

But overall, we should all be hopeful, because Epic is trying to fix things. So rather than complaining, we should just let Epic do their thing, because they do hear us and are trying very hard to address our concerns.

Thanks for reading.

470,ig_fortnitecircle,1529502791,8sih25,57,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8sih25/fortnite_is_dying/,0,Fortnite is dying,"Firstly, I just wanted to say that I love fortnite and have played it ever since the start of Season 1. Its probably the best game I have ever played and I have spent so much time playing it. That being said, I honestly feel like the game has gone significantly downhill. Here are some of the reasons why:

1. Tilted towers
We all thought that the comet in Season 3 was going to crash into tilted towers because it was well renowned in the fortnite community that this POI was just way too overpowered and was breaking up the dynamic of the mid game. The reason for this is that a 1/3 of the players land here as it is so saturated with loot and in the centre of the map. So this means that loads of players land here and die instantly meaning there isn't many people alive mid game.. slowing it down. I am yet to figure out why the meteor hit Dusty Depot and not Tilted to this day.

2. Too many POI'S
So we have already established as a community that Tilted Towers is ridiculously overpowered and has slowed the game right down compared to that of season 1 / 2. But what about all the new POI's? Because there are so many new spots to land on the fortnite map it means you become less likely to see anyone for the duration of the game, unless you land at Tilted. Right now, its either go to Tilted and have a 1/30 chance of coming out alive or go to a random POI where no one goes where you are forced to play passive for the entirety of the game as theres a much less chance of running into anyone.


3. Nerfing materials 
So before this nerf in the recent patch, the games were already too slow. Like most the games I play there is between 20-30 players left before the first circle has finished. But now, they are even slower. Why? Because no one wants to fight. The reason for this is because very few people want to risk losing their materials to fight when they know that unless the opponent has a substantial amount too, they will have to spend 5 minutes wacking trees to gain back the materials they used for the fight. It should be so that throughout the game you know you can farm a decent amount of materials to fight with in a short period of time. But now, it just feels so tedious farming and getting into fights most the time isn't worth the risk of losing all of your mats.

4. No fall off damage with AR's to structures
So not only is it harder to gather materials. But now people can beam your walls down from 250m away as there is no fall off damage. How does this make any sense? If AR's have full power from miles away we need MORE materials to combat this. I just don't understand the logic in that change at all.

The game has become significantly slower and passive as time has gone on and this is a fact. I myself, and many others are losing interest in the game purely because it is quite frankly boring to spend 80% of the game farming and not see anyone because they all died in Tilted. 

I'm not gonna sit here and slate the game and not offer some solutions to fix the pace and dynamic of the game. So here is some suggestions:

1. Nerf tilted.. Reduce the loot there, maybe remove some of the buildings. Make it so its not so centralised so its not always in the circle.
2. Remove some of the POI's.. Everyone is either at tilted or extremely dispersed around the map because there are so many places to land. Its supposed to be a fast paced game from the get go. So get rid of some places like lucky landing eg. Some people will say this is wrong, but look at how perfect the dynamics were in season 1 when there was half as many POI's. It was so fast paced, loads of fights. Because you knew there would be people wherever you landed.

3. Buff materials back ATLEAST.. IMO if anything resource yield from farming and floor loot should have been increased, to promote build fights and engagement. But i think everyone was happy with how it was before the decrease. Maybe as time progresses through the match the yield increases or reward materials for killing someone eg 50 wood for a kill or something. Or just increase material yield from harvesting or floor loot back to what it was and more. Also buff the Llama back so maybe it gives 250 of each material in solo, 350 in duos and 500 in squads. 

If Epic carries on with these random, nonsensical updates that only slow the pace of the game down even more. I think it will most certainly be the death of the game.",FortNiteBR

I've maxed my tiers for every season, still grind out daily etc etc

I remember when BR first released, nobody would build. My third game, I came second. It was so intense, I tried building a little but I wasn't quick enough to stop the other guy rushing me, this was the game that got me hooked to Fortnite. Not winning made me want to win even more than before as I was so close but didn't deserve it. I started learning from my mistakes and as time went by everyone did. We all watched as building played more of a role over time throughout each Season. Now that players have been playing for a while with plenty of experience failing while building and even winning gun fights, games etc, we now use Building as way to counter each others plays, it almost seems in an abstract form that it could be like a game of chess. We make a move and the opponent attempts to counter it in real time.

I don't think anyone in season one could ever expect fortnite building to progress to where it is now. I for one love build battles. Every build battle is fresh as every player has different experience and skill levels, you win some, you lose some. For me it would be pretty boring without it as I've gotten to the point where I win consistently in solos. (Not bragging by any means, there are much better players out there than me) I think everyone learns from their mistakes, especially in build battles, which makes you want to come back better than ever.

Look I get that Epic wants to appeal to new players, we were all new players too at one point or another but why force the experienced players to have boring fights. We love fortnite for it's main mechanic that separated it from other BR and shooter titles. It's so unique, why try nerf it? Because new players can't keep up to experienced players? Just like every other game? For me anyways it's a little grating that Epic doesn't want to support this type of ""competitive"" gameplay. Build battles in my opinion allow you to enjoy your wins as you earned it! Give new players the opportunity to practise with the playground mode. 

Once Epic introduces the playground mode, it will be a great addition for new players to practise without the discouragement of losing. I would hope that this mode is permanent. It also allows experienced builders to practise and improve once again from their mistakes. As stated by another reddit member, please don't allow us to edit teammates walls etc in this mode as it will ruin practising

I'm saying all of this as a quick rant as i'm concerned that possibly my favourite game is changing too fast and unnecessarily. A lot of these changes seem to me anyways (regarding material nerfs), extremely pointless, take away from the fun of what makes Fortnite, fortnite. 

I love the support you are providing for us Epic, but please from a concerned fan, don't change stuff for the sake of changing just because a new patch is being released. The game is getting crazy changes at the moment such as Trap damage, shotgun nerf, building nerf attempt and rockets nerf. Some were needed, some were unnecessary and take away some of the fun aspects of the game

Ps sorry for my rant, I have more to say on it but this is fresh off my mind.",FortNiteBR

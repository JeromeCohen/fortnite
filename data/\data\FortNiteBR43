So you could complete old Battle Passes. Here's how it would work.

* You can only complete old Battle Passes IF YOU PLAYED IN THAT SEASON.
* Progress from that Season would not be reset. Say you were at Tier 47 during Season 2. When you'd come back and complete it, you'd still be at Tier 47 for it.
* You can buy the old Battle Passes. Say you played in Season 3, but didn't buy the Battle Pass. You could buy the Season 3 Battle Pass for the same price.
* Battle Stars would go to both the current and unfinished Battle Passes. Earing 10 Battle Starts would get you 1 Tier in every unfinished Battle Pass.
* You could also work on the free pass.
* Some rewards would be discarded, like XP Multipliers.

I feel like this system is the most balanced, because it makes it so if you were a Season 2 OG but never got to Tier 75, you could still do that. The most probable thing is that Battle Stars aren't shared, and are instead multiplied.",FortNiteBR

And supposedly Epic is **certain** they‚Äôre gonna fix ping issues in 8.5 too.

Also with that, people have been recently figuring out how to mess with settings and create their own FoV slider which Epic instantly patched.

So thats first tip to learn second is switch out the keybindings i use ""Roll Left as button A"" and ""Roll right as D"" this will enable you to make quick and fast turns to either evade shots or quickly turn right or left after them.

i have a video demonstrating this showing how to get pro with the plane doing this things with dpi and the bindings it will make you a better pilot.    [https://youtu.be/zMXSv3ytOyE?t=170](https://youtu.be/zMXSv3ytOyE?t=170)",FortNiteBR

Honestly. I was just watching one of tfue‚Äò something iconic games, his 36 frag solo squads, and was just seeing how many people were left in the game after the first 3 circles. Now, within the first 4 minutes 80% of the lobby is already gone, making you just wonder around the map doing nothing. The 8.2 patch claimed, ‚ÄúWe feel it has resulted in an unhealthy level of aggressive play, diminishing other viable strategies,‚Äù and everyone started acting so fucking stupid like they had no idea what that meant. When you have people dropping heals for re-deploy because they can just go push people is stupid. 

Kiwiz, last night. posted a video on solo squads in season 8, and constantly complained about not having health or mats. First of all, solo squads isn‚Äôt meant to be easy, so stop complaining when 4 people have more combined health and mats than 1 person. Second of all, he would hit a few bushes and fences and say the games trash for taking away health and mats per kill. Third, he‚Äôs not an insane player. He‚Äôs really good, but not insane. Health per kill made everyone think they could pull a tfue and drop 30s every game.

Now, everything I‚Äôve mentioned is partially Epic‚Äôs fault. Adding health per kill in my opinion, is the death of the game. Health per kill was fun to most players, and even thought I felt it was unnecessary, I‚Äôm not complaining about health. The only problem is Epic introduces something that a majority of the community loves then just removes it. It like you wishing you never knew your ex because you can‚Äôt stop thinking of the good times with her. Epic did this only to bring their players back from apex, and instantly regretted it.
 
Everyone keeps saying that this is, ‚Äúthe worst state the games has ever been in.‚Äù I feel like everyone just loves throwing that phrase out there because just in season 7, y‚Äôall were saying the same thing, and I‚Äôm pretty sure planes and on shot deags are worse than no health per kill. I think the only to solve this is to increase shield spawns and to decrease all the balloons and clingers we find in chest. This way aggression is still rewarded because everyone has shield on them so you can lot it after you kill them.

I think the bunker was created as a last minute resort which the cube used when it tried to escape. I think when the cube exploded instead of riding of the cube it cursed the entire map with his power so the butterfly transported us to a reality where the cube is helping and not evil where it creates sunshine and rainbows and not darkness and lightning.

You also need to remove the ability to make stuff go down faster. I hate when those try hard sweats can build so much faster than me.

Following the volcanic eruption (see last post) everyone will have to take shelter in the bunker in the centre of Loot Lake. As explained by another users post (Forgot their name lol. I‚Äôll link it in the comments) who expanded on my theory. So, as I was saying, everyone will have to go in the bunker, and the servers will go offline for season 8...


Now, onto the battle pass. I theorised that the next season shall be a Post- Apocalyptic type season. The tier one skin will probably be some type of survivor from the blast who may upgrade and get some armour and stuff. The ‚ÄúTroll‚Äù skin I believe will be some sort of Cockroach (there is a cockroach banner in this seasons Battle pass. I also believe that tier 100 will probably be some sort of monster created in the ‚ÄúFallout.‚Äù

Onto the Map...

The map shall probably be drastically changed next season. I think Snobby shores will be renamed Viking Village. The volcano will probably be exploded in the blast and shall probably destroy the following locations: sunny steps, lazy lagoon, retail row and lonely lodge.
It will also most likely melt the snow more, destroying parts of polar peak and possibly bringing back greasy grove.

Because they've managed to become great players at the game and they're using their skills and knowledge of the game to defeat you, they're sweaty tryhards??? Like how does that even work?

So according to these people, as we get better at the game and learn new things we SHOULD NOT do these things and we SHOULD NOT play to the best of our potential so kids like this have a better chance of winning?

I'm sorry kiddos, it doesn't work like that.

If you're tired of fighting against ""Sweaty tryhards"" maybe you should get better at the game and fight back?

I mean that with respect too. Analyze your deaths. Every single one. Watch replays. LEARN FROM YOUR MISTAKES.

Coming on Reddit and complaining that people are trying to hard (in a game where there can only be one winner out of 100 players) is pretty pathetic.

For example the lags; People cry because epic didn't fix the lags yet, but they are introducing new stuff, but these people don't realize how much work all of this is. They think you just have to open the code, do a little CTRL+F ""bug"" and then right-click and press fix. No it's a lot harder and all while they are trying to fix the bugs, they put in new stuff so people don't get bored and keep in mind they also have to work on the battle pass and stuff. Another post was about creative mode ruining the experience because bad players stop playing BR and play creative, blaming it on epic, because they shouldn't have introduced a fun new mode with unlimited possibilities to make the game more fun. They of course should have known that some sweaty soccerskin wouldn't like it if he couldn't destroy kids anymore. Epic did a great job with creative, because not only did they indirectly introduce arena mode, a thing that the community wanted since S3-4, but also the possibility to make your own mode and also to train building, do 1v1 and all sorts of stuff.

Epic isn't doing as bad of a job, they actually did such a good job in giving the community what they want that the community forgot how good epic is. Look at how bad other games are handled, fortnite is in a good state.",FortNiteBR

All the kids who were playing Battle Royale before now only play creative. So there's less easy eliminations now essentially, which makes everyone who plays it frustrated. 

It's lazy on Epics part because they have to do less work now in favor of user generated content that's also subpar compared to official curated content. 

And creative just isn't fun or interesting. It's Minecraft but in an after Minecraft world. 

And the worst part of all, Epic made such a big deal about creative that there's no getting rid of it. It's just something we're stuck with because the higher ups at Epic are too prideful and fearful to admit that it was hastily added without foresight.

What I do not understand is that Epic Games is a company worth $8 Billion dollars but all they can do is make new updates to the game instead of fixing issues the community is facing, or actually listening to the community instead of implementing features that only the employees like. Besides that, I'd like the fortnite developers or anyone that can fix this to answer this post and give a clear explanation of this issue.

&amp;#x200B;

For everyone else: *Do Not Say It's My ISP because it's not... Every other game than fortnite is playable perfectly fine* 

*playing with 20 ping or lower + 0% packet loss at all times.*

&amp;#x200B;

(Because I know some idiots will still ask for my internet speed and such)

Ping: **12 ms**

Download Speed: **550 Mbps**

Upload Speed: **3 Mbps**

&amp;#x200B;

What I'm trying to explain is that it's not an issue on my side but on the side of Epic and that they need to resolve this issue before they're going to lose players because I can tell I'm already switching to different games than fortnite since I've been facing this problem.

&amp;#x200B;

We're spending tons and tons of money to 'enhance' our gameplay experience and in ""return"" we're getting connection issues and high ping? Something isn't right here, at least I can tell that I've stopped spending money towards this game until all problems in fortnite are fixed especially the high packet loss issue's

In that right, I think it's fair to say that Fortnite in its current state isn't really a shooter br, since the building skill ceiling is so incredibly high, that its become such an essential part of being able to play the game. You just can't compete unless you devote countless of hours to practicing building in playgrounds or whatever. 

I totally agree that the game should have a learning curve and a means of separating good players from bad ones, I'm just not sure if building is a healthy mechanic to separate such a gap between skill.

I have a few friends that started in Season 1, when the building was mostly utilized for base building and not much more than that. They've stopped playing since getting the building down is such a monumental task. I really can't blame them for thinking that.

As for what should be done, I really have no idea, since building has become so integrated in this game, it'll take some smart decision making to shift the skill gap into a more healthy state, where good players are rewarded, but players that choose to rely on shooting more rather than building have a fighting chance.",FortNiteBR

The other 4 runes shall appear during the course of the next week and will make their way to loot lake as the first one did. Each one will cause a tremor that will make the volcano smoke even more. Once all of the runes are in the lake, the event will happen, and here‚Äôs what I think will happen...


The volcano will explode causing rubble and magma flying towards the island, destroying lots of things and possibly filling dusty up with lava. With the volcano erupting, it will not be safe for the inhabitants of the island- us- we will have to go somewhere. And that somewhere, is the bunker in the centre of Loot Lake. I believe the bunker will be a passageway to the ‚ÄúIn-Between‚Äù- the place that we teleported to in season 6 
We will then be teleported there once again, and once we return back to the island, it will be nothing but rubble, perfect for the arrival of season 9, which I believe to be about DOOMSDAY",FortNiteBR

Now, I've got more of an idea of how Epic operates, so I can easily say I'm requesting more practical things than before.

-Still hoping trios comes back as a permanent game mode

-Update the rest of the lobby UI to match the new style of the challenges tab and compete tab

-A season introduction animation that actually demonstrates what happens, not what happens after (looking at you, season 8)

-Performance fixes. I personally don't run into too many but I know a lot do, so that'd be nice.

-Smaller changes that happen throughout the map (like the Retail Row shops and the rock couple). 

-Some new, fresh additions to the game. Not something that's going to hold my attention for a few days, but something that really adds to the game itself.

-Gun rebalancing. The bow is OP, the tac is shit, and the pistol is almost worthless. Each gun should have its own strengths and drawbacks, but the pistol and tac have much stronger drawbacks than strengths.

-Remove supply drop icons from the map in non LTM modes?

-b a l l e r c h a n g e s

-Maybe reduce the amount of snow? I'm pretty sure it's the biggest biome right now, but it's pretty bland and it's hard to see some HUD elements in the snow

-INVERTED CROSSHAIR! Take Minecraft for example. The crosshair shows the inverted color of whatever you're looking at. It makes the crosshair visible at all times, which I like a lot and think Fortnite would greatly benefit from. Especially for our hard of seeing players!

-Further console controller button map editing. Still pretty limited.

Honestly, for now, that's it. Please let me know what you guys want to see and what you think of my list!",FortNiteBR

In my opinion the only gun that should be able to one shot a full health full shield target is a sniper. I'm not saying Shotguns shouldn't do damage but 1 pumping a player for all thier life just doesn't sit right with me, and I dont think its really that fair.

I think the solution that I have would still keep pumps in the meta give tacs  more action and stay inline with the current meta of shooting your pump and following up with another weapon whether it's an AR or SMG. I think the pumps headshot multiplier should be lowered from 100% to 75% allowing for the pump to still one shot players that dont have full health full shield and also rewarding players that have good aim or that get lucky with a shot an almost dead player if the player has full health full shields. This would allow players to still keep the same meta while allowing players to still use tacs depending on its rarity (grey tac still trash). This will add more variety to the game. 

Please let me know what you think of my opinion and critique it as well.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Coaching is basically when a experienced player that is level 45 or up or has 15 wins helps a new player by joining their lobby and teaching them the game. If the coach does a good job then the new player can recommend it by rating them. If not,they would report the coach. If the player has three reports, the coaching feature becomes unavailable for him. There can also be spectator mode where the coach gives on screen directions for the player.

However, when it comes to Fortnite, a casual player is playing a COMPLETELY different game from the pros. This makes transitioning into Competitive very hard. To solve this problem we should balance casual around competitive play like nerfing those damm balls and reverting the shield and mats per kill removal. this wouldn't increase the skill gap either as new players would get better a whole lot faster than now. When everyone is good and the game is centered around competitive play, new players get better a whole lot faster.

Some ideas for this to work could be:

&amp;#x200B;

* Let everyone start with 100 shield.
* Increase farm rate
* Remove floor loot that is just ammo.
* In addition to placement points, also add points for surviving each circle, e.g. 1 point for surviving the first circle/zone.
* Reduce weapons that are useless on it's own (the first weapon you pick up), e.g. scoped revolver

- quit flying into the storm just for the fun of it
- if you‚Äôre being shot at, don‚Äôt do a knife turn, you make yourself a bigger target, and make it so your gunner can‚Äôt shoot back. 
- quit flying into every tree and building you see, it chases massive damage to the plane. 
- actually fly into the red chests, they heal you, stop trying to avoid them, especially in a fight. 
- don‚Äôt jump out if the plane just because someone it shooting at you. 
- stop flying like a maniac. 

Also if you are a terrible gunner, fly the plane, the better shot deserves to be the gunner. Not you just because you don‚Äôt wanna fly. 

Hope this helps",FortNiteBR

I look up and down and get 150 FPS, but in most areas when I look at eye level I get maximum 20. I've tried turning down my settings but it makes no difference. Interestingly, the game runs mostly fine on my other PC with an i7-6770HQ and intel iris pro, but I'm going to be upgrading the PC i play on soon and don't want to do that if it won't fix my errors with fortnite. My specs on the pc with errors are as follows:  


Intel Core i7-920 Quad Core (Heard TheStevieT say quad cores were known to have issues after 8.30 but 8.40 did not fix)  
AMD Radeon HD 6870 1GB

500GB SSD

12GB DDR3 ram  
1000W Dell PSU (no model number)  
Alienware motherboard (no model number)  


The only post I've seen that made me feel better about these issues was this:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bc1tw2/massive\_fps\_drop\_and\_lag\_after\_v830\_update/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/bc1tw2/massive_fps_drop_and_lag_after_v830_update/)  but there has been no update on this for a couple days, so I thought I would ask for help while also trying to remind the staff in case this was forgotten.

I usually run fortnite with USEALLAVAILABLECORES in the launcher, but since the patch have been using the  NoRHIThread recommended on both PCs. Really disappointing as this computer is a lot more powerful and I can barely even play the game.",FortNiteBR

Eventually I leveled up and I unlocked 100 more V bucks as part of the battle pass. Since I only had 100 v bucks, I never got around to spending it since there is nothing that cheap in the store. Today I logged in and noticed I had only 50 v bucks left. 50 v bucks isn't much at all so I don't really care but I'm just super curious as to where those 50 v bucks went??? there's nothing that cheap in the store. I'm just really confused, and I was wondering if this has happened to any of you? please let me know, and maybe we can figure this issue out! Thanks :) ",FortNiteBR

* Level 80 is not hard to get, its tedious, having long term difficult challenges would have been way more enjoyable compared to just grind, plus it allows people who have other commitments (i.e college, jobs, kids) to have a reasonable shot at achieving it.
* Not everyone who doesn't want the Halloween skins to come back have the skins, I do not own them and I would rather have them stay out of the shop. Like i said before it adds something to the skin that makes it that much cooler.
* Mats are in an odd place, they are stuck between spammy and hard to come by, you either spend half the game farming or you have no mats whatsoever, epic needs to either bring down the mat cap or revert changes to gathering speeds.
* C4 is doing a good job counter spam building but has a side effect of being way stronger than they should against pre-built bases and buildings, a slight decrease to damage would probably be for the better.
* It would be possible to grind form 75 to 80 in two days but you would have to GRIND.

I know its tough for some people, but this constant my opinion are fact, holier-than-thou attitude on ""the reddit"" needs to stop. In all seriousness though people are entitled to their own opinion, even the OP of the ""Hard to Swallow Pills"" post, but you should never take your opinion and guess work as fact and you should realize that other people may have other ideas than you, and that does not make them wrong.

That way the players who win the game more are able to get the lights and don't have to reach level 80 if they don't have time (because being a responsible adult sucks). Let's say 50 wins per part. 


This should've stopped people from complaining about the grind and it would've gave solo players a fair chance at getting full version of the skin.

All my friends play it. Everyone in the universe seems to love this game. But to like a game, I need to enjoy playing it, and that's something I can comfortably say about BR. I have reached the point where I seem to be caught in an unbreakable cycle, where I boot up the game and tell myself I am going to enjoy playing, hop into a solo match, die, shrug it off, die, shrug it off, die, finally reach my breaking point, and uninstall the game. I've tried changing controls, sensitivity, keybinds, playstyles, weapon loadouts, and nothing seems to change the steps in that cycle. The only time where I can say I have some sort of fun is when I play with friends, but then again, I only have one friend who has a PC capable of running the game, but he is more of an RTS kind of guy, so I essentially have to force him to play.

My question for all of you is, well, what should I do? Should I just throw in the towel? Should I sit down for a long time and really get to know the game? Should I watch thirty in depth guides and train myself until I finally win my first game? I honestly don't know what to do at this point.

Discovering a gun that doesn't exist (Whoa!)

Serching for some meme
Banning aimbots

Finding gold SCAR
Spraying an Omega poster

If you look at the cracks in the sky, they're are 3 distinct tears or clusters of cracks. Also, we've had 3 objects randomly appear on the map. The anchor, the carriage and more recently, the pile of bones.

Currently, Epic has released two teasers for season 5, and I believe tomorrow will be the third and final one.

So here's the theory. Each teaser is linked with an object that appeared on the map and represents a timeline. Each tear in the sky will open to each respective timeline, and so on.

1. Vikings = The anchor is linked to the Viking axe teaser.
2. Samurais =The Japanese mask is somehow linked to the pile of bones (Haven't been able to make the connection, maybe one of you can)
3. Cowboys = The carriage and according to my theory, tomorrow our third and final teaser will be linked to the wild west.

Epic games is one of the best developers we‚Äôve had in the video game world in the past decade. They know what the people want and they do it, so here‚Äôs another problem I found that should be addressed ASAP. Currently, I am level 72 and I know most of my friends are also close to level 80 but won‚Äôt make it before the season ends. Before you say something like ‚Äúyou probably don‚Äôt play enough‚Äù or ‚Äúyou just need to git gud,‚Äù let me tell you that I play Fortnite almost every day, and on rare occasions spend 10+ hours straight playing it. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that someone who‚Äôs devoted so much of their time to complete every part of the battle pass can‚Äôt level up to 80. This problem was temporarily fixed with the double XP last weekend, which gained me 4 levels when I was playing casually. Currently I have to grind nonstop to get XP in hopes that I‚Äôll possibly get to level 80 but I don‚Äôt think I will. I‚Äôve heard many people complain about this and I‚Äôve come up with a solution. You know how last season when Epic granted 20 free battle pass tiers to the players? They should do the same thing, just with 5 XP levels, and then have double XP for the rest of the season. This would give thousands of players the final push they need to get to level 80. Of course these changes need to be implemented immediately if they are to have effect, given that the battle pass ends in 2 days. Epic, if you‚Äôre reading this, please, take my advice.",FortNiteBR

-Level 80 should not be an easy thing to attain but it also shouldn‚Äôt be based on the amount of hours you put into it solely. It should be based on performance as a player.

-I don‚Äôt own any of the original, or Halloween skins but can completely understand someone‚Äôs desire to express their long term fandom for the game in an exclusive way. (Actually prefer this to epic milking a few cheap bucks out of their largely child player bases, Parent‚Äôs pockets. Would much rather see Epic create new worthwhile skins.)

-Mats current state encourages less close range encounters, and for the average player, with average aim, and skill the assault rifle is not reliable enough to be used effectively in mid to long range engagements.

-C4 is an extremely low skill ceiling weapon. (it‚Äôs easy to use) it is an unrewarding item to use because it is not hard to use. As opposed to the sniper, or grenade launchers which are higher skill ceiling weapons the C4 often feels cheap, and unfairly hard to counter. (Potentially add a 3 second beeper on the C4 so a player can reasonably react to it.) I find myself taking C4 over snipers, and grenade launchers now just because of how viable it is however I find kills with C4 exceedingly less rewarding than kills with other power weapons.

-There is a huge problem with over deletion of thought out posts by mods in this thread.

Sometimes constant complaining is a result of a true need for change not just complaints for complaining‚Äôs sake.",FortNiteBR

Imagine if in different POI i.e. Moisty Mire, Wailing Woods, Tilted Towers, they added neutral monsters or animals or even like a small army of bots to kill in solo, duos, or squads for a in game reward like loot, weapons, or mats. The reward could vary based off the difficulty of the enemy, and the health or the power of the enemy is based off what game mode you're in. If in solos the enemy can be weaker with less health and damage, or if an army of like warriors they could have less warriors than they would in duos or squads. Think of league of legends, how there is the jungle/buffs in the game that don't effect the players unless you approach them or attack them. Kill them and you get a reward.

Think of how cool it would be to just kill of a squad or solo and be low on health or mats so you pull up your map to check the area and see if there is anything near by you could try to go kill for a possible helpful reward. 

The enemy type could match the location i.e. if you were in wailing  you could fight a team of black knights, or if moisty turns into a dinosaur esque tarpit area there could be a T-rex that attacks you and breaks builds with its tail, or at titled above the big grey brick building in the middle have some giant eagles flying around that you can fight if needed, and in haunted it could be zombies or something similar to that creepy vibe.

And for after you kill the enemy a notification can go off to the rest of the map notifying everyone that that location has been cleared and there is a person or team whose killed it. 

Maybe have it in the kill feed like:

&lt;player name(s)&gt; killed the &lt;location name&gt; monster/enemy/horde/knight

 That could make for good rotation changes and fun ways to flank a team that may be fighting the enemy.

Epic said they're focused on changing the meta and season 5 so i doubt this idea will go anywhere but i think its an interesting idea and could possibly change the pace of the game and maybe give incentive to land other places.",FortNiteBR

And it's not due to me playing the game for a long time, I've played games for much longer periods of time and still love them so much (Payday 2 and R6S have been my main games since their releases). I really believe that Epic need to implement a reward system for players who win or just do good in matches.

I'm not a bad player at all, I win quite a lot of my matches (obviously not the best player out there but I'm far from bad) and genuinely wins don't feel good at all to me. I might be alone here but when I win a match, be that a solo, duo or squad, I go ""nice"" and just re-search for another map. There's no reward for winning games or getting high amounts of kills apart from the occasional challenge in the battle pass for ""winning one match"". You could argue that the battle pass skins and tiers are a reward but you don't have to play good or win matches to earn them.

What I personally think would fix this is:

- RANKED MODE (score is calculated for placements and kills, kills work as a multiplier for the amount of score you earn if you earn a position in the top five, die top 40 and lose points) I think this is definitely what Fortnite needs, imagine there being special rewards for the top ranks too like a skin for the top rank that can't be gotten anywhere else and the ranks reset each season. This gives so incentive to keep playing and getting wins to get that all-exclusive skin to show off your skill. 

- customizable unlocks for large amounts of wins, kills etc (win 50 matches or come top 5 for 50 matches and win a pickaxe or something like this) I think something like this would really work as instead of how you can essentially buy the top battle pass skin, this you can really work towards as a big project, and it doesn't have to just be wins. Something like build 5000 structures to unlock a backbling or collect 20,000 ammo for an emote. Challenges like this that are supposed to last the entire season that give big, exclusive rewards and can't be earned through paying would be a beneficial addition to help Fortnite in the long run

Please leave any criticism or discussions because I'd love to see this actually be perceived as a real thing.

Certain areas are believed to change, Moisty Mire into Pirates Point, Motel or Prison into a Wild West Saloon, and many more areas from different eras. Yesterday (7/9/18), Fortnite tweeted a picture of an Egyptian like style cat with a rift coming from the eye, which could hint towards an Egyptian style desert area. This means there is a chance for a Greek/Norse mythology area. The Season 3 Battle Pass had astronauts and special agents. The astronauts were hinting towards the comet being in space, and the special agents were tied to the government setting up around the comet in Dusty Divot. The Season 4 Battle Pass Tier 100 skin is called Omega, which is a Greek symbol. Earlier today (7/10/18), the Fortnite Twitter tweeted an axe with a rift. The logo for God of War is an omega symbol, Œ©. Until the new God of War, Kratos had been in and around Greece. The new God of War takes place close to somewhere like Scandinavia, where Vikings lived. In the new God of War, Kratos uses an axe called Leviathan, which looks similar to the axe tweeted earlier today. In the God of War campaign, it shows pictures of Egyptian gods and hints at the next God of War possibly happening in Egypt. The rocket at the villain base was believed to be called the Leviathan. We have not had the name officially connected to anything besides the legendary skin with the fish bowl. Fortnite had the Avengers: Infinity War Limited Time Mode with Thanos so a cross over from a popular game isn‚Äôt impossible. And considering how popular Fortnite is, another cross over is bound to happen again. If Kratos was part of the Battle Pass, it could profit both companies and draw in more players. ",FortNiteBR

I was level 65 two weeks ago and honestly didn't think I could make it. I'm 30, married, and have a 55 hour a week job. I simply don't have the time to dedicate to the grind. But alas, a vision came to me in the night and that vision said ""Excuse me sir, may I have a moment of your time to talk about our lord and savior, Fortnite Mobile?"". It was at that time I set out on a mission. 

Now I didn't reach level 80 in the most...honorable...way, but it was the only possible way to do it. While I slaved away at my 55 hour a week job, my phone lay in my desk...and on that phone, there was a pickaxe gripping Raven sitting in a bush...embracing the bush. Wireless headphone in my ear, I listened ever so vigilantly for that song of storms to play in my ear, signaling time to bush wack my way to the next circle. 2 Weeks of 10+ games a day being a wookie warrior, I was able to average 800 - 1100 xp a game, I finally made it. 

So thank you Epic!! Even though it's a pain in the ass to play on, Mobile gave not only myself, but a lot of members of the community a tool to assist us in the grind and for a lot of us, we would've never reached that goal without it. ",FortNiteBR

This gives dedicated players something to show off and be proud of. 

The problem however, is that Fortnite is set up with a seasonal timegate for these prizes, which means once they're gone, they're gone. This is great ad it keeps the game fresh,  however if you're going to have these types of challenges you should address your community at the start of the season to set expectations. 

You're a business and you want to make money, if you had set expectations I would have probably brought your 10 tier battle star thingo to get to lvl 100 sooner. This is because I work full-time and share my ps4 with a 10 year old, so I don't have the luxury of time to complete the grind.  Hell, I'm not even going to unlock Omega's chest Armour.

I feel burned because you gave me the option of having the prize, but didn't tell me about it until it was too late. Well actually, the community told me about it. Please Epic, if you're going to have challenging prizes that require time gated time sinks, give us a heads up! ",FortNiteBR

* Causes players to get burnt out quicker due to numbers ramping up at higher LVLs
* Solo and Duo players are at severe disadvantage in terms of gaining XP compared to Squad players
* Higher placement is A LOT more rewarding than higher number of kills
* Engenders passivity and camping

And those are just some examples

**There are actually lots of ways of improving it:**

* Same amount of XP needed for every LVL up
* More EXP for kills (Most Requested by the community)
* Kills should give the same amount of EXP (Right now it's 50 for the 1st and 20 for the following)
* Higher EXP rewards in both Solo and Duo (2nd Most Requested)
* Battle Pass rewarding higher amounts of EXP (1,000 is simply insignificant)
* Different in-game activities rewarding XP (Opening chests, ammo boxes, consuming certain amounts of shrooms/apples, e.t.c.)

So please, EPIC, think of some way of reworking the system, so, maybe, in Season 6 the game will become even better.",FortNiteBR

What I really think Epic should do is give 50-100 exp per kill (at least on solos) so people will be more tempted to go for kills rather than camping. Giving more exp for kills will also help solo players get to level 80 next season, as this season it seemed unfair for them. What do you guys think?

TL;DR Epic gives too much exp for camping and not enough for kills

I've heard that argument a million times and I am sympathetic to it I don't like epic punishing skilled players to reward noobs and make more money but hear me out here.  I'm not advocating a serious nerf to building, just a small one to make the range of playstyles and tactics more diverse and to punish spam builders.  Maybe eliminate turbobuild or create a very short building cooldown.  Maybe after you place so many blocks you can't place another one for 3 seconds.  This is partly to punish spam builders, which would end up rewarding skilled builders who place their blocks in the right places.  

But the second reason is this:  Back in season 2 and 3, most good players were either good shooters or builders.  The best players were both.  Players like me with good gun skill could not do a whole lot of building and win games through solid gunplay.  Season 4 comes around and between turbobuild and more players learning to build players such as myself couldn't keep up.  So like most other players like me, I learned to be a good builder.  Now here's where removing bloom comes in.  The way I see it, a minor nerf to building and removing bloom will allow players to rely more on shooting to win games but also still allow players who are great builders to rely mostly on their building skills.  Of course players should still HAVE to be good builders.  You can't just be all shooting and no building, that's why I'm advocating for a minor nerf instead of a big one but doing this will allow players to have a more diverse set of playstyles to win games. Removing bloom will reward skilled players, and a minor building nerf targeted at Spam builders will reward skilled builders who know where and how to place their blocks.  In effect, this would hurt noobs more rather than punishing good players.

Thoughts?

Tl;Dr make these changes to allow for a more diverse set of playstyles and punish spam builders",FortNiteBR

The average player then rebuts with ‚Äúit makes omega‚Äôs lights special...‚Äù and ‚Äúmeans you need to work for it‚Äù. 

The problem with this, is that reaching lvl 80 shows no skill whatsoever. It‚Äô simply just quantity of games over quality of games. If epic plan on continuing this XP bar for rewards then they either need to reward XP for skilled gameplay, eg. Wins,  Winstreaks, Kills etc.  Or on the flipside, just add challenges back, like with John Wick‚Äôs Car, but instead make them involve skill, such as winstreaks, kills with harder guns etc. 

Most players of fortnite are casual, fair enough, most people have lives, but the rewards should then help cater to these people by being skill based. It means players who actually deserve to be rewarded get rewarded instead of people who can afford to play multiple hours a day.

There is an issue right now because the largest rewards in XP are winning and time in the match. This makes sense in theory because rewarding staying alive and winning should work in a game that is all about being the last man standing. but it doesn't make exciting game play, nor does it lend itself to quality competitive play. 

So a counter to that is increase the XP for kills. But if you do that you run the risk of making the game the most rewarding by jumping into high population areas, get as many kills as possible then getting killed or killing yourself so you can rinse and repeat. 

So here is my suggestion, make the placement in the match reward an XP multiplayer and not a static amount of XP. BUT it doesn't apply to the time in a match XP. it only applies to the XP that you gain by doing things in the game. 

actions in game you get XP for:

Opening Chests (5XP)

Searching Lamas (5XP)

First kill (75XP)

additional kills (25XP)

Revive when teammate is downed by an enemy  (25XP)

Placement multipliers:

10th 10&amp;#37;

9th 15&amp;#37;

8th 20&amp;#37;

7th 30&amp;#37;

6th 40&amp;#37;

5th 50 &amp;#37;

4th 75&amp;#37;

3rd 100&amp;#37;

2nd 200&amp;#37;

Win 300&amp;#37;

XP you get that does not get multiplied by placement.

time in match - 1 XP per second

This means that you can earn 200 XP in tilted in kills and looting, you could jump off a cliff and get 200 XP placing 30th. Or you can fight to win and that same 200 XP turns into 600 XP! that seems like a worthwhile reward for fighting to win while also giving players a reason to strategically engage enemies.

Calling them immature, childish, basically whatever demeaning insult you can think of. Everyone posts this like it's some controversial opinion but it's very clear a large majority of this sub feels that way.

But I must ask: Why? Why do redditors feel hell-bent on telling others how or why they should enjoy the skin they purchased? Why is liking a skin for aesthetics okay but liking it because of it's relative rarity a mortal sin?

Take the Skull Trooper as an example. Let's be honest here, the skin is ugly. It doesn't have a unique model or anything like that. It's a low quality skin. If Skull Trooper were to release tomorrow for the first time, this sub would be full of very disappointed people. And rightfully so. The quality of skins has increased vastly since the Halloween update, and frankly, the Skull Trooper has not held up well. The reason that skin has so much appeal and notoriety is because of how rare it is. If skull trooper were to release again tomorrow, as more players purchased it, it would lose all qualities that made it unique. We saw this exact same thing happen with the Red Knight. Before the re-release seeing a Red Knight was a pleasant surprise. Now they're everywhere. The ""OG"" owners are lumped in with all the new buyers and the skin has basically become a meme. It's been ruined for anyone who owned it previously and used it because of it's rarity.

And for the record, I don't own the Red Knight, or even the Skull Trooper for that matter. But after seeing what happened to Red Knight, I hope that the Skull Trooper never comes back.

And a final note, just because you personally may not care about a skins rarity doesn't mean that it isn't a factor for other people, or that it's an illegitimate concern. To those who really think that way, I would ask that you try and remain open minded when discussing the issue. There are other perspectives than your own.",FortNiteBR

Plus, it is near impossible to search chests when 20 people go to that location. And some other challenges such as ‚Äú Visit center of circle 3 times‚Äù were pointless and time consuming. I think challenges for this season should be tied more into gameplay that comes naturally, so that we don‚Äôt have to go out of our way to complete them and waste a game.

For every skilled Fortnite player there are hundreds of bad players. A company at the end of the day regardless of what you wish want money and they will do and change the game to make that happen. Lets say the skilled players got their wish of fixing the game in a skilled persons favor. Those things might consist of (depending on who you are) a nerf of explosive weapons, smgs, miniguns. No more phasing through walls. Balanced trap damage. Balanced shotguns. Sorry but pumps to a head can't do 9 damage. Not when the game is this big. Other weapon balances. And last but not least that bloom. A skilled player would get the build battles back and if you're not building up you're dying. To the skilled player that sounds like a step in the right direction. Issue is this. That type of game is not catered to the new audience and new wave of people massively flooding into the game. The new players don't stand a chance and there are new players that quickly give up on the game when they are running around in the middle of loot lake and next thing they know double ramps are on top of them and a red knight is double pumping them in the face. That constantly happening to a new player is disheartening and would drive them to quit. When that happens these players are no longer buying skins, battle passes and etc. As I said in the beginning there are hundreds of bad players to every skilled player. So OFC Fortnite is going to start favoring the game towards the newer players. They want that money. They would be dumb not to. That's why as much as I hate saying it......they truly truly truly need matchmaking. I shouldn't be in a game with someone on their first game and I also shouldn't be playing with someone on their 5,000th win. ",FortNiteBR

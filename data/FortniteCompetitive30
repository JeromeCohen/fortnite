Why do you get 2 points for 3 kills but getting 2 kills gets you the same reward as 0 kills?
How about a more comprehensive system that actually rewards skill? This is what I propose:

PLACEMENTS
- You get a point per placement. So you come 99th? You get 1 point. 2 points for 98th placement all the way to 100 points for finishing 1st.
ELIMINATIONS
- you get 12 points per kill. So you finish a game with 7 kills? You get 84 points for your kills.
ADDITIONAL POINTS 
-You should get additional points for different milestones. For example, 3 kills should get you an extra 10 points. 5 kills should get you an extra 10 points and 7 kills grant you 10 more points. This means that even if you died on 1 or 2 kills, those kills are actually rewarded because each kill deserves a reward and makes engagements more incentivised despite the threat of 3rd parties( which is inevitable in this small map with 100 decent players). 

-Placements should also have milestones for points. For example top 75 get 5 points (good luck hot dropping constantly and missing out on 5 points each time if you keep dying early). 
-Then every tenth placement after top 51 gets extra 5 points to push people for endgame to simulate actual tourney practice. So placing 50-41gets you 5 points, 40-31 gets you 5 points, 30-21 get you 5 more points and 20th to 11th get you 5 more. 
-Each placement from top 10-6 should get an extra 3 points and top 5-2 should get you an extra 6 points per placement. 
-Victory Royale gets you 25 points 

Your final point at the end of each game is divide by 10 so the number isn’t too large. Say you got 205 points in your first game, this will be represented as 20.5 points to keep things concise.

Now I’m not saying that these numbers can’t be tweaked a bit but let’s simulate actual tournament practice boys, there’s not 28 people left by the time first circles closed in skirmishes.

If you haven’t quite noticed yet, Epic does not cater to the competitive side of their player base. 

They continually ignore optimizing their game whether it be QoL updates, fixing building/shooting bugs, or adding mechanics other competitive shooters have (custom crosshairs, FoV slider, etc.). The only thing Epic games seems to focus on is adding items for less skilled players to compete with people who’ve mastered the game mechanics (grapplers, splodes, planes, mythic swords, etc.).

The longevity of Fortnite ultimately depends on ranked matchmaking, long term goals/rewards, and competitiveness. I think it’s time we take a stance agains Epic and show them that they HAVE to change their pop-up cup system and show some gratitude toward their experienced players who’ve grinded to get to their skill level.

Maybe someone can make a graphic that can be shared so more people will know about this. If we get enough people and possibly a few streamers, we will finally get what we want from Epic.",FortniteCompetitive

9,3030Gold,1549523577,ao1787,15,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ao1787/competitive_fortnite_in_asia/,1,Competitive Fortnite In Asia,"Hi, this post is for Epic Games to read...

Fortnite is an insanely fun game to play, however it isnt when you get over 300+ Ping... 
So in this post I want to tell you what it's like to live in Asia and trying to play Fortnite Competitively...

So, to start Fortnite in Asia only has to servers. (Singaporean and Japanese) 
Most of Asia heavily relies on Singaporean Servers and the servers were fine until the middle of Season 6.
In Season 6 the Japanese servers were added as Japanese people use to get high ping. (This is all fine as in Season 6 nothing was wrong) Now if we fast forward to Season 7.
Season 7 is a great season but is being ruined by Planes and etc. Asian players also have to deal with matchmaking not choosing the right servers.

For Example : My friend who lives in Indonesia (Its a country right next to Singapore)  Gets 20 ping which is great if we get Singaporean Servers.. however getting GOOD servers are extremely hard now and 7/10 times we get bad 100 - 150 Ping Servers...

Now... in India( where I live ) I get 90 Ping. Now 90 ping is good and has grown on to me. But ALL the time I queue up into any normal game mode I only get Japanese Servers which gives us  MiddleEastern/Indian players 300 - 500 ping.

Therefore, not many players from Asia cant win Pop Up Cups as the Pop Cups are held in Japanese Servers and screws over everyone else who lives further away from Japan. That's why it is crucial to make better SEA Servers. 

Thanks for reading, if everyone could please upvote and @Epic Games to read this post it may make a difference.",FortniteCompetitive

With the positive uproar that apex has been experiencing these past couple days such as the fact that they doubled their concurrent players from 2 to 4 million in ONE day and basically every well known streamer is praising how great and fun the game is on social media, I’m sure that Fortnite has become weary of the fact that if they do not address the wants of their own community that they will not stay on top for as long as they would like.

I've noticed that there is often a lack of public servers that run solo scrims during the week, especially on NAW.  In attempt to remedy this issue, a few guys and I recently made a scrim server that is strictly NAW and runs mostly solos with some duos.  We started accepting members about 4 days ago, and we currently have about 1.7k people in the server.  We run solos all week for 4 hours a day, and on the weekend, we run solos and duos all day.  Duos on Friday are for money.  Also, we use strictly EU rules.  However, we are still very new, so we are still looking for staff and a bot with more features.

 To start, Pop Ups are only available for 5 hours a day and the meta changes every week (mat count, editing everything, etc). It's super frustrating to get out of work and have an hour or two to play the pop up especially when you spend most of the time adapting to the new meta. Then on top of that, you play with actual potatoes (worse than pubs)  until you get closer to 20 points. Then you play educated potatoes who splode spam + deagle, storm push, w key with planes, etc. And then the pop up ends and you wait until tomorrow to have the same experience but this time with a teammate. 

A permanent ranked mode would be so much better than these limited time pop ups. It would improve the quality of this game by so much if the bots could play with the bots and the sweats with the sweats all the time. 

Also fixing/vaulting all the broken weapons would make this game so much more enjoyable and competitive :) ",FortniteCompetitive
49,Warejackal,1549481216,anuf8t,32,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/anuf8t/ranked_wont_work/,1,Ranked Won't Work,"The daily posts crying for ranked are getting out of hand, and I'm finally driven to post this to explain why Epic would fail if they created a separate ranked playlist instead of the pop-up cups. Simply put, there isn't a player base possible that would allow for a working ranked system unless it completely replaced the normal game modes.

**The Player Base Problem**

Fortnite is possibly the most played game ever (don't quote me on that), but even that isn't enough to have a player base large enough to support a ranked mode on top of the normal game modes and on top of the various rotating LTM's. Do you realize the difficulty in matching 100 people who are the same rank? Pop up cups are the only viable method because they concentrate the player base to specific times. If you can play ranked any time then you'll never have the amount of people you need at once to have a chance at actually balanced games. 

Even now players complain about pop-up cups being hit or miss, especially in the mid-range of points, because each person you run into could be a hot drop kill god or a bush hiding bot and you never know which. Imagine halving the player base at any point and you can see how that problem would be exacerbated.

Consider the top tier players and streamers as well. In order for them (and others) to have a competitive game, they should only be playing against themselves. Can you find 100 top tier players at any given point playing? Probably. Are they all going to be playing ranked and queuing at the same time? Probably not. Thus, queue time becomes an issue. Many players say that they'd happily wait 5 minutes to have balanced games, but that time is laughably short compared to what it would actually be - especially at off peak hours. Overwatch has a ranked mode and it only searches for 12 players with very clearly defined wins/losses and rankings and even then queues can be extraordinarily long for high ranked players. I'm talking about hour and a half long queues for a single game. Nothing would kill this game faster than streamers having to wait for 30 min to even get in a game, thus discouraging them and their viewers from playing ranked and thus creating a cycle that diminishes the player base even further.

**Persistent Ranking Problem**

Another frequent complaint is having to slog through the early games in pop ups to get to the more fun and balanced high point games. Many say a ranked mode would fix this by allowing you to pick up where you left, but many miss that a ranked mode would have to incorporate a way to lose points and therefore create the most ELO hell-like system ever designed. Fortnite, and BR as a genre, is too heavily RNG to accurately allow a ranking system to work. Many of you who have played other games probably know that charges of ELO-hell can be common but rarely ever accurate. Certainly even in Fortnite the better players will accrue more wins than worse players over time - similar to a game like Poker, but supposing players are evenly matched than the deciding factor becomes random: loot differences, circle placement, who previous fights were against and more. Combine this with the player base issue, which would result in ridiculous queue times that would ripple outwards and kill the game or large differences between the lowest ranked player in a match and the highest and the RNG becomes too high to accurately move players up and down a ladder. 

TLDR:
This community has not thought through the sheer problem of 100 people matchmaking that pits its efficacy against speed and available players. Games with vastly lower spots to fill struggle to do it properly even with vibrant and dedicated player bases. Further splitting the player base with a permanent ranked mode would cause the matchmaking system to either fail in the long term or take too long.

It is not in Epic's interests to create a ranked mode no matter how much this community cries for one. I expect them to address this by continuing to use pop up cups and possibly allowing custom lobbies down the road for streamers and high ranked players to create their own practice sessions with concentrated player bases. If you disagree with this, feel free to let me know why but I simply don't see ways to overcome the concurrent player issue for 100 person lobbies in a viable manner that allows for persistent and accurate ranking without preposterous queue times.",FortniteCompetitive

I dont feel like I'm going to have to go def to play the game. Meaning I dont feel like I need to have my volume up high like I do with fornite. Notice in fortnite the ARS are so damn loud? And notice how you have to hear footsteps... but increasing volume to hear footsteps means the consequence of the ARS being loud asf? 

Apex I can hear and the sounds are balanced decently.. I could go in more depth but I dont need to tell you what you guys already experienced.. either sacrificing the sound of footsteps over chat volume or having to have the volume super loud just to hear stupid balloons or footsteps but as a consequence having your ears blown out from guns.

Then, it took 2 hours to get 2 more points, and I got frustrated and gave up. I was continually getting w-key'd by players who were certainly mechanically better than I was, but imo they mainly made very stupid plays. My last game for example, was nearing the closing of the 3rd circle, 15 people remaining, I had ultimate highground on top of a hill and a perfect setup to rotate for the late game. Then I get plane dived and the guy 50/50'd me. He was better than me mechanically so got highground after knocking my structure down and got the kill. All evening I died to better players, that were making very stupidly aggressive plays, risking their own placement. I have heard the 20-30 point range is quite like this. Do I have to be more aggressive in this range to break the 30 mark?

Over the last month, 95% of the changes from updates have been great. However, the game is still not in a good place. There are many core, blatant issues:

&amp;#x200B;

Sounds absolutely need reworked. I have talked about this in a past thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/agdkfd/fortnite\_sounds\_are\_terrible/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/agdkfd/fortnite_sounds_are_terrible/)

&amp;#x200B;

Farming mats IS NOT FUN. I do not want to spend a significant amount of time per match farming in order to be relevant for a build fight. Farming is BORING for both casual and competitive players. I literally dread farming every single match. The farming rate needs to be at least as high as in the pop up cups (40%) in all game modes. Period. 

&amp;#x200B;

This game's shooting model is not sustainable for the future. If you are a competitive player, I hope you can agree that the current shooting model leaves more to be desired. Don't comment ""people will get lasered from 200 meters."" First, this test was never confirmed by anyone legit (to my knowledge) that it took place. Two, in a hit scan, no-bloom shooting model (that was apparently tested), damage would be adjusted to do less per shot plus there would be actual range drop off. Time to kill really would not change if implemented correctly. However, any shooting model would be better than the current. A change is needed.  

&amp;#x200B;

There are WAY too many game breaking bugs/glitches. I just played Fortnite for 2.5 hours. I died to the double fall damage glitch in an end game. My character froze for 5+ seconds after hopping off a quadcrasher, which got me killed. My pump did not shoot multiple times in the same fight, resulting in my death. General server lag, frame drops, and micro stutters are a general occurrence as well. Some bugs, like the pump not shooting, have been around since at least season 2 from my experience. Fortnite is not a beta. This is a full game that will have ""beta"" slapped on it for the rest of its life as an excuse for its mistakes. There are no excuses to have glitches from a year ago still around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shields still seem to not exist. Shield drop rates need to be higher, and/or we need a consistent way of gaining shields (like HP per kill, even something lower like 20 or 25 HP). 

&amp;#x200B;

Planes need to be vaulted in S8. I really do not think I can get through another season of Fortnite with planes. They ruin the game completely, especially scrims. This issue speaks for itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

Third-partying is often talked about. Third-partying, in itself, is not an issue. It will happen in any BR game. HOWEVER, the problem in Fortnite currently is the ease of third-partying. Planes, for example, make it extremely easy to locate a fight in the distance and absolutely ruin it. I can fly around in a plane all day and watch a fight take place below me. I can land whenever I feel like. It is so easy to get free kills. 

&amp;#x200B;

The floor loot system is terrible. I should not be able to loot dog house and come out without a weapon. Ever. We need more floor loot (with drop rates of items changed to compensate.... the goal is to not inflate the loot pool). Ammo floor loot should not be a thing. That is what ammo boxes are for. Overall, floor loot needs to be much more consistent with more spawns. 

&amp;#x200B;

The quality of life changes we ask for go unnoticed. We have asked for an interact key for ziplines for 9 weeks now. Still nothing. This is such a simple change, but Epic does not care at all. We have all had games (especially scrims) scuffed from ziplines. 

&amp;#x200B;

Apex Legends just dropped, and it is extremely refreshing. It boggles my mind that a game *upon release* has little if any bugs, is optimized, and is extremely fun. Epic has the resources and capabilities for Fortnite to be a polished game. Apex Legends may or may not relevant in the long-run, but Fortnite will eventually get real competition. Epic should keep this in mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are so many other issues I could mention from a competitive standpoint, but the above points are holding this game back for me. I want to love this game; I truly do. But, I cannot keep investing time into this game if these things remain to go unnoticed by Epic or unchanged. If you want to downvote me, go ahead. I do not care. I do, however, care about this game, and it's future.

Here how to fix traps
-traps only deal 75 damage
OR
-traps only activate 10 seconds after being placed
OR
-traps are one hit from a pickaxe regardless of what material it’s placed upon

Nobody wants to risk losing 150 health so people don’t jump in others boxes too often to finish a weak opponent after you’re done with bot lobbies (10 points upwards) This is an even bigger issue in skirmishes where there’s 76 alive in the 7th zone. Epic clearly want more definitive action midgame with their recent edit changes. I think my first option is by far the best, followed by the third option. This would be perfect with a deagle nerf allowing skilled players to be able to turtle and protect themself even when weak",FortniteCompetitive

If you want to be good at the game, and you want a skill gap, then be prepared not to be handed things like not having to aim. To truly have a skill gap this step of removing the broken ads spam is apart of that. I've seen a lot of people comparing how ads spam is needed because PC players can: build fast, edit fast, aim with a mouse, etc. The difference is building, editting, and aiming, takes a lot more practice then clicking and unlinking L2. These are actual skills that help create a skill gap, where as ads spam does not. I'm prepared for negative votes but I feel this needs to be said.",FortniteCompetitive

We NEED 50 shield/health and 50/50/50 mats on kill in normal matches more than ever now. ",FortniteCompetitive

1. No longer had to sacrifice an item slot for a deagle strictly for utility.
2. No longer had to spam 800 bullets into a wall while someone turtled, or pickaxe their wall and attempt to replace it while they held Mouse 1.
3. No longer had to worried about whether or not it was my wall in a fight, which allow me to focus on the player more.
4. Allowed me to navigate with little to no materials through builds that were already built, which helped me during third-party situations.
5. Made knocking one by one's down a lot easier as I edited the top of the walls and destroyed only the ramp.
6. It felt like the game flowed more. Every fight I took was non stop action with both players moving in and out and working hard to outplay there other, quick edits, fast rotates and drops, and timely builds made fights fun again (for me)

While health per kill and mat per kill is a step in the right direction, i think it incentivizes dumb w key plays too much. 15-25 lobbies especially suffer from this. What would be much better imo is to have mats per kill, but when your out of combat, have a slurp effect (1 or 2 health per second, maybe even limit it to 150).

This would incentivize good positioning and placement while still having a good balance for going for kills by gettings mats on pickup.

I'm va1edictorian and I started playing Fortnite around the end of season 3/beginning of season 4. I initially played the game casually (with friends/family) until around the beginning of season 6. By the time Pop-Up first rolled around, I had only scrimmed in FNPL and even then I wasn't consistent in terms of my schedule. I averaged around 15-18 points in the first round of Pop-Up Cups (the time limit was much less than the 5 hours it is now) and ended up with 24 points in the Winter Royale Qualifiers. Within a month (from Winter Royale Qualifiers), I went from averaging 20 points to maxing out at 33 points in the Explorer Pop-Up Cup on 12/17/2018. Here is the leaderboard post for that day : [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a7dvp4/solo\_explorer\_popup\_cup\_1217\_community\_leaderboard/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/a7dvp4/solo_explorer_popup_cup_1217_community_leaderboard/)

I went on to score 40 points in the Explorer Duo Cup using similar improvement strategies

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img m8zv4sz9bre21...*

Below, I have outlined a list of tips/tricks that helped me improve (Note that all of these are a matter of perspective and this is just what worked for me). Also, they are not in any designated order of importance.

1. **Do not hot drop.** ( I know it sounds like the way to go, especially early when everyone has 0-3 points, however the RNG associated with dropping in an extremely populated region is not worth the maximum 3 points that you can get off of kills. After watching countless hours of pros playing these pop-ups, I realized that they always go to their preferred landing spot and hunt kills mid-game when they have a safe amount of materials/loot. 
2. **Find your ""spot"".** ( Understanding the floor loot spawns and chest spawns of a location gives you a tremendous advantage over opponents that land in your ""area"". You might have noticed that top Pop-Up Cup performers tend to go to the same location every game and it is for a reason. They know the area EXTREMELY well and even if someone randomly stream snipes or hot drops them, their knowledge of the landing spot gives them an immense advantage. Also, you want to keep in mind that your landing spot should allow you to max out on atleast 2/3 material types. To remove RNG even further, I suggest landing at a place next to Mushrooms, so that if you do not get shield from Chests/Floor Loot, you can still get to 150 total hp and even if you do get shields you can save them for late game use. Ghost Bizzle does this with his Dusty Divot drop and Liquid Chap/72hrs do this when they go Wailing Woods.
3. **Play for placement ALWAYS!** (Mid-game kills become more and more difficult as you climb the point ladder. Furthermore, if you're going for a 30+ point score you definitely do not have time to waste so dying 10-15 minutes into the game because you W-keyed someone is definitely not ideal. Have a game plan before you start playing and tell yourself at what point range will you switch to strictly playing placement and getting kills on late-game rotations.)
4. **Get a plane and don't fight!!** (With recent changes to plane spawn rate and increased plane damage when breaking structures, ramming into people's 1x1s is no longer ideal. Planes can essentially give you a free ticket to top 20 in a competitive (25-30 point) Pop-Up game if you play correctly. To prevent being shot out when you're in a plane early-mid game, be aware of where the bus route was and which locations are going to be highly populated. Also, pay attention to the next circle and always try to fly as close to the storm as possible. People on the ground that cannot outrun the storm will likely be worried about rotating instead of shooting you down if the storm is on their heels. Another small tip is to take your wrap/skin off your vehicles. This can not only confuse players to thinking that no one is in your plane but it can also allow you to park your plane off  the edge/cliffs of the map and not be detected as easily. If people want, I can show the different locations that you can park ""off"" the map on with a plane in a separate post.)
5. **Confidence wins games!** (I cannot tell you how many times I've rotated in the last couple of circles without even using materials and haven't been punished simply because I had the guts to make the call and move. With a 1500 material cap, and also no longer being able to instantly get materials for kills, saving mats late game becomes extremely important. You should always be thinking about how many players are left, where they are, which side of the map will be least populated, which angle you can rotate from without getting pressured, and who you can pressure for late game eliminations. One thing I've noticed from Ghost Bizzle in these Pop-Up Cups is that he does an OUTSTANDING job of conserving materials and knowing when he has to actually build and when he can sneakily rotate without cover. Later in the game, his advantage in terms of materials becomes extremely important as he is able to contest and then maintain high ground, increasing his chance to win the game.

These are just some tips that have helped me improve my performance in Pop-Up Cups, some may be more obvious than others but I just wanted to share them with the community. If anyone would like to discuss these tips further in the comments I will gladly reply and also if people would like to see an in-depth VOD review analysis of a 40+ point Solo Pop-Up performance by a particular pro just let me know in the comments of who you would like to see. Also, let me know if you want to see a video showcasing places ""off"" the map that you can park planes on, which can be useful in conserving mats and also not getting shot out.",FortniteCompetitive

183,JackTheDalek,1549356117,anc8t1,12,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/anc8t1/architect_editing/,1,Architect editing,"So I managed 21 points on the pop-up cup last night, and as a controller and Original PS4 user I was pretty happy. 

It's just concerning to me that as I played, I realised it was actually impossible to keep up with the amount of editing going on. It felt like my only option at times were to just sit and wait for a person to edit on me and try to hold them, however this led to a lot of 50/50s thanks to psycho W-Keyers. 

I don't like the fact that the skill gap between console and PC seems to be ever increasing, and yes I understand I'm on the ""inferior platform"" or whatever but some people just aren't in a situation to upgrade. We need more options on console because it's becoming an epidemic. If changes like these are going to continue then surely we should have our own console lobbies to make it fair?",FortniteCompetitive

So short background story. I’ve been playing the game since towards the end of season 2 and had only a short break during season 5 where I didn’t play the game for about a month. I’m still playing the game but not nearly as much as I did when I was new to it. The main reason being the constant questionable changes and items added by Epic. I’m able to adapt well enough to stay ahead of most but to be honest, I got tired of the routine; 1 step forward 2 steps back endless cycle. I’ve experienced both the good and bad times this game has had to offer and so I’ve decided to construct my own ‘perfect version’ of the game. I think it will be interesting to see how people view my ideas of how this game can be improved from my standpoint and whether anyone will agree with these changes.

**Map**

There are plenty things I would like to change regarding the map such as bringing back Greasy Grove, Flush Factory and Factories in place of Polar Peak/Happy Hamlet… reviving Dusty Divot + Factories. This among many other things I would like to see changed/reverte. HOWEVER, I understand how Epic adds new locations to fit the seasons and their battle pass so changes I will be suggesting are adaptable to any of Epics regular changes to POI’s and the map itself. 

**Gameplay**

· Remove all zip lines except the ones connected to Polar Peak

· Reinstate all original rift locations.

· Farming increase to match the same rates seen on Pop-up Cups

· Material cap – 999/500/300

· Vending machines re-worked to cater to these mat caps (e.g being able to deposit any amount into it. This will also be great for duos/squads)

· 50 Health/Shield granted directly on kills. During duo/squads, the player who downed an enemy receives health when fully eliminated.

· Materials dropped on elimination – 50/25/25

· 3rdPerson view reverted to its state as seen in season 3

***Vehicles***

· Shopping Carts

· ATK

· Quad Bike

**Game modes**

***Trios –*** Should be made permanent and a competitive game mode in place of squads. Squads should still be available for pub games

***Ranked –*** Add it.

***Competitive –*** All competitive games (Tournaments/Pop-ups/Ranked?) should be separated by platforms. With all the recent hype surrounding the use of L2 spam on controller it has become more apparent than ever that no side likes being at a disadvantage to the other. The only way to solve this is to completely separate them. Because during a tournament with thousands of dollars on the line, everyone deserves a fair chance. It’s a shame because this is the first game to successfully implement cross-platform on this kind of level.

Thanks for reading. I may have left out a few things out that I’d like to see changed, so let me know what you think of what I’ve got so far and also what you would like to see added/removed from the game. If I like the suggestions or if you can convince me otherwise then I’ll add/remove it. 

Let’s try and make the ultimate game mode together and hope Epic see’s it!",FortniteCompetitive

My biggest issue was not being able to see how long is the path I had to travel. Recently I finally started to realize what I had to do. Right now I am in a place where I consistently improve week after week, day after day. I am not at pro level yet, mind you; but I'm getting there.

To really achieve growth in anything, you first need to get a faint idea how tall is the mountain you want to climb. Struggling to improve without any means to judge how far you've come, can be overwhelming.

Consider this:
Two people set out from Paris and are told to walk towards a certain direction. Person A is told that he is going to Germany which is roughly X km far. Person B is told nothing. Who do you think will have the hardest time walking?

Prologue over. Moving on to my actual advice. Here's the four simple things I do.

1) Identify your mistakes and work on them. Even if you don't think it will help. I thought kovaaks wouldn't help me. Well it did. Big time. Trust me and start playing kovaaks and warm up courses in playground. Everyday.

2) Stop watching pro player stream. Tfue is a god and all but you cannot do what he does. You are not yet at the level where you need to have pro level game sense. Learn to shoot and build first. Making the best decisions won't save you from messing up your moving circle edits and dying from storm. If you want to watch something, watch more average players and learn from their mistakes.

3) ALWAYS favor stream and pop ups over pubs. I don't care if you don't have a duo. Go to looking for group and find one.

4) MOST IMPORTANTLY you have to ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS play a couple of pubs after playing scrims for a couple of hours. Yeah it seems unorthodox but hear me out. After warming up against good players you will dominate in pubs. The thing is that THERE IS WHERE you notice your growth.

In scrims it takes a long time to notice improvements. Yeah you will win from time to time but since there is no ranked mode, you can't really tell how much your performance gas improved. In pubs however, you will start to notice the little things. That 250m quick scope. That quick edit kill. The 1vs3 you won easily. You will start doing all those things unconsciously and that's when you will realise that you are improving.

After all when you return from the gym you ALWAYS flex in the mirror. You need to see your biceps growing. Same thing in Fortnite. Give yourself some form of gratification for that's where confidence comes from.

Hope it helps someone somewhere. I am enjoying the game much more now and that clearly is reflected on my performance.",FortniteCompetitive

This is why they haven't made a Console Only tournament yet is because on console everyone lasers everyone so people would be hiding the entire time and whoever got in the least fights would win.

But most of this community in this subreddit is a teen and they don't understand how logistics work business wise. Fortnite currently has a massive player base. Adding a ranked playlist splits that player base up. Then further more it is splitting players up in the ranked mode based on their rank. A 100 player battle royale game would never find players in a respectable time. So this is slowing loading times for casuals and the small competitive community which isn't a good user experience at all.

Just look at the popup's for proof. They have 4 different platforms queing up and it still takes forever to find matches. Why do you think pop-ups are during a time where everyone is home after school and work? It's a population problem and I think epic is doing their best with the pop-ups. 

So keep posting all those suggestions for ranked etc. Just wasting your time before you fully understand the business side of it.",FortniteCompetitive

1. Always eat/sleep before pop-up cup, your health irl = your performance in game, you should be in good mood aswell
2. 1v1 worst type of training for pop up cups, you barely do 90's in 20+ point games, instead focus on turtle wars (CQC with edits even more important rn since we have new rule set with Architect Mode) and edit courses (thanks to all ppl who share their courses on this subreddit)
3. Music, I really thought music would distract me from sounds in game, but Its not, it helps to keep calm condition at least for me, dont overthink pop-up cups try to play like pubs at least till top20

If for whatever reason you can't play during these time slots, you're basically out. A lot of people (myself including) can only play 3 hours+ of pop-up cups during weekends. They currently have squads on both friday and sunday and duos on saturday (at least this saturday, not this weekend). So I can't play solo pop-up cups. This is really frustrating, and I don't think it's that hard to do something to make pop-up cups accessible for everyone:

\- Different time slots. For example in EU it's 5 pm - 10 pm CET. For example, why not make this 1 pm - 6 pm in weekends? I think a lot of people would love to play during the afternoon in weekends. 

\- Shorter time slots, but more frequent. Take a look at the way they did it for Winter Royale: 3 time slots of 3 hours on both saturday and sunday with a break between the time slots. No worries if you can't play during 1 or 2 time slots, there were enough chances.

\- Being able to choose your game mode. Why not give us the option to choose between solo's, duo's and squads each night? This would make it more fun for people who don't have a 4 man squad 3 nights a week or for people who find squads too hectic. It might cause queue times to be longer, but this could be fixed for example by putting people within a larger spectrum of points together in a lobby. 

There's probably a lot of simple things I haven't thought of that would make pop-up cups more accessible for everyone, these are just a couple ideas on top of my mind. Bottom line is that there's a lot of people missing out right now. And with Epic talking about building competitive Fortnite around pop-up cups, it seems that these people are missing out on more than just good practise. ",FortniteCompetitive

I ussualy got anywhere from 24-34 points in popups without edit rights. I was able to compete with pc players and not have to worry about a symfuhny wannabe editing down into my box when im healing from 10 stories above... i managed 16 points in my 1 solo session and came to a conclusion that with editing rights to all in the game it gives pc players a huuuuuge advantage over controller and if epic wants to ""keep all platforms competing toghether"" then rip comp controller players.",FortniteCompetitive

-Gun shoots uncontrollably after switching out of building mode 
-Build immediately doesn’t build immediately 
-Ghost shots with shotguns after switching modes 
-Shotguns show pellets hit but give no damage
-Ammo disappears in weapons when swapping (Ex: I have 60 bullets, pick up an enemies ar while looting, his gun is empty, I pick up my again and I’m now down to 30 bullets even without reloading his weapon)

-Frame drops/freezes
-Game freezes for 5ish seconds when in a plane north of loot lake
-Yesterday I started drinking a fucking shield while in building mode, no bullshit
-Gun won’t ads and sometimes wont ads or fire

This is all I can recall. This is in the last day of play time alone. Some are more common than others such as my gun shooting by itself, while others are situational like the plane freezes.

The ranking system is entirely novel in its approach – as it is one of only two Fortnite player rankings and the only one that directly compares each player to their competitors.

The metric that we have created to ultimately rank these players is VeLoScore. VeLoScore essentially measures how well each player performed relative to the other players in a tournament and gives them either a positive or negative score for that tournament. These single-tournament scores are then added and the cumulative VeLoScore is what we rank the players by. 

It is interesting to note that only a few players have negative scores, and this can be easily explained. To make our data more structured, we set a cut off that noted you had to have played in at least 7 major tournaments to be ranked. Very few players were repeatedly asked back to the skirmishes if they didn’t place well, and as a result all the players with negative scores did not play in enough tournaments to make the count. 

Along with comparing players relative to the average player in each respective tournament, we also gave each individual tournament a unique weight to properly evaluate their importance and the skill of the players that played in them.  

We also provided an adjusted solo and duo placement to provide more context as to how each player performed in each type of event. The adjusted solo and duo placements measure each players average finish in either solos or duos in relation to how the rest of the players in the tournament performed. 

The rankings do not stop here, as each week they will be updated and a new feature will be added. In the future I am looking to add team rankings, as well as add more advanced stats and metrics to the page.

The main idea is to invite people that are also in college and have everyone assigned roles based on the school they go to. This way others might be able to meet people from their Universities that also play and so people can organize things like 1v1s, turtle wars, etc.

IF it would pick up enough traction creating a league the way FNPL has it but purely for colleges might be pretty fun. It would essentially be setting up a Collegiate League that actually scrims and the games are not just pub stomp/frag outs. 

I am the President of the Fortnite Club at Ohio University and I already have a discord that I have started to do this with. Only a few players from different colleges are currently in it but it might be a pretty cool community to have.

Recently, I've been getting into games and jumping off the bus and my textures won't load. Trees, ground, and buildings are just blobs. I have to fully land, and often, my textures still won't load and I cannot go through doors and appear just to be floating. This isn't only happening in game however, I start my game and the news pops up, however the only thing I see in the 3 boxes of news are white screens. Regularly it might've shown a new gun, event, or skin, but for me there is just white. I go to events, and the thumbnails for the cups appear to be loading. I also get hitching while playing. This only happens in Fortnite, I play CSGO with 150-250 FPS. This doesn't happen to my friend and we have the same specs.

Specs:

GPU: GTX 1060

CPU: i5-7400

Fortnite Settings:

Resolution: 1600 x 1080

View Distance: Epic

Effects: Low

Post Processing: Low

Textures: Epic

Shadows: Low

I do stream, but get the same results while streaming, and without streaming. I have overclocked my GPU. My fortnite is on high priority, and my OBS is as well. I usually have Timer Resolution, Discord, OBS, and Spotify open with my game.

What I've tried:  
\- Turn off my stream (same results)

\- Lower settings

\- Capped my FPS at 200 or 144

\- Getting rid of my overclock

\- Restarting my PC

\- Put my Fortnite on High Priority",FortniteCompetitive

This leads to many unfair advantages.
 If you had a gray assault rifle. But your oponent has a gold scar. Whos gonna win? 
3rd partying is a huge problem. You finish off an openent and someone shoots you down 1 second later. Is it fair that you can get killed from a mile away from someone you couldnt even react too.

Controller players have tried to explain how this is mostly a prevalent issue on PC (prevalent really being a placeholder for only to avoid flames, theres maybe 5 controller players in each pc lobby). We point out every instance and explain every scenario besides the two PC players are complaining about. We make no leeway and get flamed. 

&amp;#x200B;

PC players have explained how Mid Range Tracking and AA seeming to lock on (when on a good pc with a controller and low ping, read: not a console player) are slightly too strong. Most have requested a COD sticky assist for PC, or encouraging ADS delays (can't believe this idea is gaining merit, who wants to shoot an ar, let go of ads, and attempt to reshoot the ar and get a cooldown, reddit could barely handle the single shotgun delay). They make no leeway and get flamed.  


Partly this is because the white knights on both sides refuse to bend, or acknowledge anything outside of whatever they are complaining about. Then there are those of us on both sides getting tired of typing pages of actual good information to paint the picture and make it clearer. We also make no leeway and get flamed.  


TLDR: Create a Sticky Thread, or Ban the Topic. We couldn't even make a post about Kevin (saying cube) when he came out. You honestly like reading the same 2 or 3 arguments from both sides with nothing added?

(I did some calculations),"So we have very little actual facts about Fortnite player pool, but winter royale gave us some information. There were 9,2 million people who tried it, but the theoretical maximum number who finished even one 3h session out of possible 18H was about 36 000 players. That is if every other 9 million players died in 30 seconds and never tried again. Of course, the real number is much much less than 36 000. That number should also be divided between different regions, so the number of top tier players for different servers could be actually really really small for a game with 100 players lobbies. Fortnite is the biggest game there is, but the number of players who would rather play ranked instead of fun modes could be much lower than with most games, and Epic maybe knows that and tries to find different solutions than 24/7 ranked mode. Nothing is just black and white, and Epic themselves said that they want to do competitive that is fun and exciting so there is, of course, that philosophy behind their decisions, but there most likely is also some facts they need to deal with, that they do not want to tell publicly. So it is possible that there just are not enough competitive Fortnite players to fill balanced ranked lobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

To start, there is one thing I think everyone here can agree on: that an early game RPG is overpowered, and much more so than other strong early game weapons.

Imagine this as an example:

You are one of the best players in Fortnite, and, in a competitive match, decide to land at Pleasant Park (which, granted, is a normally a hot-drop, so you can't expect to win every time there). If you were to get, let's say, a grey pistol, and your opponent was to get one of the other extremely strong early game items, such as a golden pump, if you were clearly better than that player, you would still have a very good chance of winning that fight. That is because to shoot you, your opponent has to be directly in your line of sight, meaning it still comes down to aiming (bloom of the pistol aside), as well as some limited early game building/editing. If, however, your opponent had gotten an RPG, your chances of winning that fight drop significantly, because there is virtually no counter to an RPG in the early game. Your limited building would be ineffective, and since the RPG does splash damage, your opponent would be able to kill you *without being able to directly see you*. This is obviously a huge issue in competitive play, as a mode designed to highlight and reward the most skilled players, turns into a mode of rewarding the luckiest players, just like public matches.

**The fix:** I think there are multiple ways to go about fixing this issue. I think a way that shouldn't be used to fix this issue is slightly dropping RPG rates as Epic has tried in the past, as it still allows the underlying problem to continue to exist. I think that the best way to fix this issue would be to eliminate the RPG from the early game entirely. The most popular way, according to the community, to do this would be to have the RPG spawn exclusively in supply drops, however, there are other ways that this could be achieved as well. The bottom line is that somehow, in some way, the Rocket Launcher should be eliminated from the early game, so at the very least, it can be countered when other players are more looted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on, I believe the second prominent issue with the RPG is its ability to spam so effectively. The reload time, as well as the ammo of the RPG, have been nerfed before, and nerfing them again could be a quick fix, but I think that there is a much better option that would not only increase the skill gap of using this weapon but also give players facing the infamous gun some breathing room. 

**The fix:** Have rockets deal different amounts of damage depending on your distance from the explosion. For example, if you get hit head-on with a rocket, it does the exact same damage it does currently, but if you are right on the edge of the hit-radius, reduce the damage dealt significantly, maybe by 80-90% (and of course, the damage dropoff would increase the further from the explosion you are, starting at 0% moving upwards). 

Another potential solution to this problem would be to keep the damage mechanics that RPGs currently have, but revert back to the structural damage that the original rockets did, so that one rocket doesn't completely obliterate an entire structure, allowing the opposing player to breath, and giving them a chance to still out build/out play their opponent.  

&amp;#x200B;

The final issue with the RPG in its current state is more of an issue with its best friend, the Deagle, however, I may as well mention it here for the sake of it. The RPG-Deagle combo is virtually unstoppable, and the only thing determining if that rocket gets into your box after the Deagle shot is ping (and maybe a tiny bit of luck). Of course, by the very nature of the RPG, this isn't something fixable with an RPG nerf. On top of that, you can pull off the same combo with the Deagle and other projectile weapons. For example, you could throw a grenade and use the Deagle to get it inside a box, or in Duos/Trios/Squads, even use the Deagle in combo with a sniper rifle to get some cheeky headshots. 

**The fix:** It goes without saying, but the obvious fix to this is a Deagle nerf. 

I think there are many ways that the Deagle could be reworked to make it effective, without it being broken. I think the first (and most fun) way to do this would be to temporarily vault it, and bring it back as a replacement to the hunting rifle, which could then be vaulted. What I mean by this is, bring the Deagle back as a gun with 100% perfect accuracy (or at the least very little bloom) and bullet drop, the damage of the gun could even be upped a little bit after a change like this, as it would suddenly be even more skillful to use. The new and improved Deagle could be made to where it still one-shots newly built structures, but also can't one-shot any fully built structures, including wood. 

The above is the fun fix but probably won't happen any time soon. A more realistic and practical fix would be to keep the Deagle in its current state entirely, but stop it from one-shotting wood. 

&amp;#x200B;

If anyone from Epic sees this, I would really appreciate any sort of communication, and if you were to implement any of the above changes, that would be amazing, and something virtually all of the competitive community would appreciate. You've made a great game, it just needs a lot of work before it can truly be a competitive eSport where the most talented players have a fair opportunity to showcase their skill!

&amp;#x200B;

No. Wrong. Epic's 3 part 'Competitive Fortnite' series thus far has been extremely underwhelming. After being told theres huge announcements to be made, all we have is a leaderboard which resets every 24 hours. Literally everything else is the same, except they may fluctuate the time of each tournament to accommodate everybody.

485,imbAndes,1549075849,am9yjg,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/am9yjg/discussion_the_skill_gap/,1,[Discussion] The Skill Gap,"With the introduction of the new pop-up cup I see a lot of people talking about whether this change **increases/decreases the skill gap**. On one hand you have people saying that the new popup cup **increases** the skill gap because it requires you to:

1.) be more aware of your surroundings (you can be edited on anytime)

2.) be really good at editing

And on the other hand you have people saying it **decreases** the skill gap because:

1.) build fights/strategies matter less (coning opponents isn't as strong, height isn't as strong and getting height takes skill, etc.)

2.) recognizing which build pieces are yours is part of the skill gap, if everything is yours it dumbs down the game.

Regardless if you think the new pop up cup change increases/decreases the skill gap, I'm here to discuss how you can tell if something increases/decreases the skill gap, some examples, and whether or not decreasing the skill gap is fine under certain circumstances where it's negligible (QoL changes).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**How to tell if something increases/decreases the skill gap**

Imagine the best Fortnite player in the world in a game with 99 other bot level players in the new pop-up cup. Let's use Tfue as an example as the best Fortnite player.

Let's say Tfue gets in an engagement with 1 of the 99 bots. He wins the engagement but takes damage. Another bot comes along and third parties Tfue. Tfue dies because he is unable to heal up in a box safely, a realistic situation. Because of this, I personally think the new pop up cup lowers the skill gap. In the old pop up cup, Tfue can kill, heal up, kill some more, and so on. With this new pop up cup, it makes it harder for Tfue to survive against bots, hence **lowering the skill gap**.

Another example to illustrate my point. Although a bit extreme, imagine if every gun in the game did 1 damage. That means that if a casual player wanted to kill a player like Tfue, Tfue would have to ""misplay"" 200 times. Tfue would never lose. Now let's flip it. Imagine if every gun in the game did 200 damage. Tfue could potentially lose to any casual player because all it would take is ONE bullet. Tfue has no margin for error. It wouldn't make sense to say ""*if every gun did 200 damage, it would increase the skill gap because everyone has to be more aware of their surroundings and have a high game sense IQ and good positioning!*"" This is what people say who support the new pop up cup because they believe it ""raises the skill gap"" and I have to heavily disagree.

Basically, if you want to know if something increases/decreases the skill gap, just imagine a really good player, and think to yourself ""Would this player survive **longer** or **shorter** if a new change was implemented into the game?"" If it's **shorter**, the new change causes the skill gap to **decrease**. If it's **longer**, the skill gap **increases**. 

In conclusion, I believe the new pop up cup lowers the skill gap because of the reasons stated above.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Stuff that lowers the skill gap but is GOOD for the game (QoL changes)**

Often on the sub/forums I see people hate a change because it decreases the skill gap. What they don't realize is that yes, although the change does decrease the skill gap, it is **DEFINITELY WORTH IT**. What are these changes you might ask? Here is an example:

Auto material change (your mats switch type automatically when you run out of a certain type)

Back then, some people were against this change because yes, it does lower the skill gap because you no longer have to pay attention to your materials as much. However, if you were to ask any player today if this feature should be removed, most people would say NO. Why? It's a nice quality of life change and although it decreases the skill gap, it is totally worth it. It makes the game FEEL so much better knowing you don't have to do some mundane task. I bring this up because it saddens me whenever a good QoL suggestion is brought up and people say ""*No, it lowers the skill-gap*"", ""*You might as well have markers that tell you where every enemy is and how much health they have and what their inventory is*"", etc. 

Let's imagine that Fortnite had no pre-edits to begin with. Then, a patch came along and said ""*we're allowing you to pre-edit your structures!*"" You already know people would say ""*OMG MUH SKILL GAP, PLACING A WALL AND THEN EDITING IT IS A SKILL, NOW WE CAN JUST PLACE A PRE-EDITED WALL?!?*"" Today, people WANT to disable pre-edits. Regardless if you like pre-edits or not, having an OPTION (yes, I know there is no option to disable pre-edits) to have pre-edits on or off SHOULD be in the game despite it may ""lowering the skill gap"". 

I bring up this previous point because I actually have a QoL suggestion but I know people would disagree with it because ""skill gap"". My suggestion is to be able to **bind each pre-edited piece to a key.** That means you can have a separate key bind for your wall, and a different key bind for a wall with a door. Just like with the pre-edit example above this may lower the skill-gap (although I would argue it would increase the skill gap because it's not like casual players would be able to utilize all the extra inputs anyways). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anyways, I'm not sure where I was going with all this. I just wanted some discussion about the skill gap because I see it on so much on this sub. And tired of people turning QoL suggestions into rants about decreasing the skill gap. What do you think? Is my view of the skill gap correct/healthy?


**TLDR**

I believe the new pop up cup decreases the skill gap because it makes it harder for a good player to survive against casual players. Sometimes, lowering the skill gap is worth it if it enhances quality-of-life. I have a QoL suggestion to be able to bind each pre-edited piece to a key. Anyways, hope you read the whole thing so we can get a good discussion on this topic.",FortniteCompetitive

The traditional ranked system last for weeks, or in some games forever as long as you keep playing. The consistency in which a player can maintain his skill level is very important too. 

The only thing ""evolutionary"" about this thing, is that Epic can now use it as another marketing tool, or as they put it ""allow as to better promote community activity around the events"", like they have been using ""competitive Fortnite"" for the past year. ",FortniteCompetitive

Please change the schedule...,The lag in these games is unreal at the end. Having 28 people in the second moving zone is causing me to take storm damage when on my screen I'm a solid 15 meters from the zone is bad. Either fix the lag or make it solos and duos until you can make it work. Everyone wanted more duo dates and solo dates - You gave us more squad dates... Leave squads for Friday nights only. ,FortniteCompetitive

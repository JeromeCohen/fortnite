I've been playing Fortnite since Season 2, but for that Season and Season 3 I didn't buy the Pass, because at the time I wasn't too sure I would keep playing for this long. But there are some items I'd really like to own.  
I understand that some of you may not like this idea, because Season Pass cosmetics are liked for their exclusiveness. But I think it might be an interesting idea and it would please many players. It may sound weird, like a child whim maybe, and a bit selfish also, but in my case, I've played these 2 seasons with the Free Pass, I enjoyed them, and I think I would have enjoyed them even more if I had the Season Pass. So if Epic would give us the opportunity to get at least one item, it would be a kind, but also symbolic present.   
It would be any type of cosmetics that are suitable to be bought in the shop. So it wouldn't include Backgrounds, Emblems, and others items like that. The offer would be available on Christmas Day only, and as said in the title, it could be one and only one item, whatever type it is. And maybe you could buy items only from seasons you've taken part in, so it would keep a bit the exclusive aspect.  


I hope I've been clear enough.  
Open to opinion and comments from you guys, thanks !",FortNiteBR

The main idea was just exciting things around the map. Season 4 had a huge storyline with the movie and all characters like Omega and Carbide. I think season 7 is going to have a big storyline as well.  Reaching the end of season 6, a snowstorm is heading in the map northwest of Flush Factory. I believe the map will be covered with snow, different POI, and bushes and trees that have lights around them. Season 7 battle pass will consist of something to do with snow/winter(maybe a snowman or elf) and snowballs as the toys. But the main idea of season 7, I think that The visitor will come back in the rocket and revisit. The A.I.M can very well be friends with The Visitor, showing that the A.I.M could possibly come out of the snow, which is a totally different world coming to fortnite. It could very well have a big location destroyed especially if Visitor comes back. I don’t think Tilted Towers will be destroyed, but I do think the broken building in the middle of Tilted will be a Christmas store. But, it could be possible Salty Springs or Lucky Landing could be replaced with something new, especially with theory’s before about them being destroyed.

I also just killed 6 people in tilted and everyone had weapons and was a pretty fair fight, but I’d keep getting hit for like 10 minimum by each of them, so eventually once again I can’t find meds and a dude shows up and lands a 7 damage shot on me and I die.",FortNiteBR

I know you guys like pictures and photoshop but you're getting a list of things instead. 

The Battle Pass for next Season should have Challenges that span the length of the Season. 

1. Play 1000 Matches

2. Kill 500 Players

3. Win 5 Matches

The specific numbers should be adjusted to whatever works best, i think you need challenges that are **simple** and will accumulate over time no matter what.. 

These should be worth **15-25** Battle Stars. Maybe more. Maybe these Challenges will help people who don't like the weeklys as much but they know they are still playing towards a big reward. 

i suppose they would come easy to a certain group of players, what do you do in that case? 

i'm not sure but i would love a long term goal to work towards over the next Season.

I have made up a list of some positive and negative aspects of life steal. Positives and negatives that are **bolded** could be considered either a positive or a negative depending on how you view it. Which ever category the aspect is in is where I believe it falls under.

*Positives:*

- **Passive players won’t be rewarded**

- Players that are too unfortunate to find any form of shields still have a chance at gaining shields

- Encourages players without shields to look for fights which can decrease camping in bushes and buildings

- **Players fighting more than 1 enemy (e.g. solo squads) will have a significantly better chance at winning**

- **Aggressive more confidant players can spend less time healing and more time looking for fights**

- Medical consumables will all around be more common considering people won’t be using them all that often

- Being “third partied” will be easier to deal with


*Negatives:*

- **It will be harder for newer and less skilled players to get kills**

- “Thirsting” players while playing team game modes will be increased

- **Players randomly gaining health (*Scenario:* Two players are build fighting, Player 1 placed a trap some time ago, random default dies to trap, Player 1 gets +50 health/shields in the middle of the build fight without Player 2 knowing how, Player 2 dies because they thought their Pump Shotgun shot for 90 damage would kill Player 1, Player 1 is left alive with 40 health)**


*Thank you for taking the time to read all of this.*

I actually found that concept on google images and couldn't resist sharing it to other people. I couldn't find the source though so I decided not to say that I did it myself so you guys wouldn't think I'm a reddit post stealer.

I found the original maker of this concept u/Zubtub 

So please don't be mad at mefor sharing this wonderful and pretty cool idea.

All credit goes to u/Zubtub and also don't go on hating if you don't know the backstory reddit.

Insgightfully

Someone has uploaded a “leaked” season 7 trailer. There are a couple of explanations as to what it is.

1. A REAL work in progress trailer.
The animations and quality are really bad. This could be up to the trailer being unfinished. However, with less than a week till release, I would think they have the trailer fully complete by now. This would also explain why calamity is the centre character and not a new one. The department making the trailer may not have received the new character models yet and are just using base calamity as a placeholder. The fact the wizard skins are shown also goes with the season 4 trailer, where the detective skins where shown.

2. A fake trailer.
The most favoured opinion. This does seem REALLY good for a fake. The fact that they managed to get the whole Fortnite map into a program is amazing. They also used never before seen models (the plane) and animations (the cowering calamity and then the one where she is looking at the snow). On top of that the weird portal/symbol in the sky looks really hard to fake aswell.

If anyone could provide evidence that any of the animations or models are from things like SFM, please link it and I will update the post.

I think that it would make the game a lot less spammy and would mean that annoying teams wouldn't be able to spam rockets while their team runs at you spraying and just killing you without any skill or even effort.

It cannot deal 100 damage to the body like the blue and legendary/epic shotguns can, and can 1 hit to the head the same as shotguns yet has less bullets in the clip, reloads slower, and requires more precision. 

They were really fun to use by hip firing and weren't OP back then and most likely won't be now.

I think that there should be a limited time mode or some sort of separate mode where the old map and old guns exist. The last few seasons have been ruining the map in my opinion because personally I never land at any new places such as paradise palms or lazy links very often. I think there should be more open landscape how it used to be to offer a more tactical style of playing (rather than everyone landing at tilted and there being 20 people left when the first zone isn’t even in yet). This game mode/new map would have all vaulted items such as the revolver that were in since season 1/2 included and have the newer weapons removed such as miniguns, new SMG’s, hand cannons, and you get my point... I think this would be a brilliant addition giving a nostalgic and better feel to the game

Now that we have the heavy AR and I've been using the silenced ar for a long time. I can safely say, I don't think it's very good, if not just downright bad. I can't find a reason to pick this thing up.

The gold silenced has the same exact DPS as the blue AR, but has significantly worse bloom, and the purple one does less damage. The regular scar beats it in both damage and bloom.I seriously think I'd rather run a blue AR than the silenced scar usually.

So imagine a system where there was 
this new currency (Gold, Candy or whatever) that you would earn 1 of for every minute of game time (In game, not lobby or spawn island). This new currency would be used to buy a llama for somewhere around 250-1000 depending on what is it (250 being pickaxes and 1000 being skins) and that llama would give you a random item from whatever theme is available that week until rotation on update day. That ends being around 16+ hours of gameplay for a skin. Also these skins would be the same as the skins in the item shop but llamas can’t be bought by vbucks.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

So say your internet is out and you want to play in playgrounds, you can launch the game in ""offline mode"" and you can go to the lobby, locker and that is it since everything else requires a stable internet connection. In your game selection its only playgrounds and is run in the latest installed patch. You can run that match for 1 hour just like a regular one without any players or connection. This would be pretty neat to practice building or explore the map or do the challenge games.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/tcwon2k19s121.png

&amp;#x200B;

Krampus serves as one more old Germanic mean to scare children into good behavior.  According to his lore, he takes naughty children away forever.  He serves as the counterpart of Saint Nikolas (AKA Santa Claus).  To this day, he is celebrated as a horror fan's favorite holiday monster and has his own day of recognition on December 5th.

&amp;#x200B;

This particular design is based on his looks according to a few old illustrations of him plus a couple of extra touches.  The design elements from said illustrations are his asymmetrical legs, long twisted tail, handcuffs with chains on his wrists, a human-like face, long ears, goat horns, and fur similar to a gorilla where the palms, fingers, and foot bottom are left bare.  The red suspender straps are included to make back bling look good when worn.

&amp;#x200B;

Speaking of the back bling, it is the iconic wicker basket with a red and gold thick ribbon around it that Krampus puts naughty children in.  Since Fortnite is not a game about kidnapping brats, it is used to carry many items that work great with Krampus' lore.  The first notable thing in there are the bundle of sticks; the preferred weapon of choice to whip the children.  Next is a spare pair of his handcuffs, which can be seen in some old art of Krampus as he walks away with a bunch of children chained together.  He also carries lumps of coal; the one thing Santa Clause gives to naughty children and it's a crafting material in Save the World Mode.  The last items are a couple of demonized toys based on the Feisty Pet toys.

&amp;#x200B;

As suggested by a few others, I added a couple strands of chain strands that wrap around his torso that is held together by a golden lock.  This design aspect is to serve as a nod to Universal Studio's version of Krampus from their 2013 movie.  It's the only thing based on it since I am not a fan of the design.

&amp;#x200B;

My personal touches are the reindeer skin loincloth and brace plus a ring on his tail and a more animalistic face.  I am aware that each skin has a significant amount of clothes on and all skins do not have the crotch or butt exposed for many good reasons.  The loincloth is to cover a majority of those concerned parts to make it suitable for the game's intended audience.  The leg brace is there to simply add some more flair to the skin as well as the tail ring.  The monstrous face brings out more of his goat-like features and to allow this skin to bear intimidating fangs just like the Dire skin.  I kept it flat in order to make rigging easier to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest challenge with getting this exact skin design into the game is the potential technical issues with rigging the model.  I know how tough it can be through experience [creating legs for another game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czmx2g2C7ao).  If the asymmetrical legs serve as an issue, I am willing to compromise in order to make the skin work.  Out of the two ideas, the idea of going with the human feet will be the most preferable and may work with the game's style design with the addition of a second leg brace.  The other idea would be to make them both goat hooves shaped similarly to Dire's wolf legs.  Another concern would be the tail because, as far as I know, there isn't the ability to add bones similar to the jiggle bones in the Source engine.  Clipping through the back of longer back bling items like capes may be a potential issue as well.  I am willing to have the tail be changed to a short goat one that won't require bones to make it work.

&amp;#x200B;

Why do I want this skin in the game?  It is proven that skins with animalistic features work with the game and the holiday season is approaching us.  Krampus is a fiendish touch to your typical holiday cheer; breaking the monotony and giving horror and monster fans something they would enjoy during this time of the year.  It will also be a great nod to the Germanic mythology.

&amp;#x200B;

I am hoping this is convincing enough.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: Krampus is not a ""furry"" just because he has goat features.  Anthropomorphic creatures have been around since the dawn of mankind and tbh, some people need to calm their tiddies...  Besides, if the furry fandom likes this skin for reasons, why does it matter to you?  Let them have their cake and you eat yours, ok?",FortNiteBR

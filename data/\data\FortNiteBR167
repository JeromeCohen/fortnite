So I'll make a helpful suggestion instead of just being negative about it being removed.   

**Make it so you can only redeploy off MAP objects, such as mountains, tall houses, buildings, trees. Not off player built structures.**   

I think this change allows you to still use the re-deploy function, but only in a limited capacity, you can no longer just glide away from a build battle, you can no longer build super high and glide to the zone. But you can easily get down from mountains, off buildings in Tilted, etc. ",FortNiteBR

I think to help reduce the RNG levels of Fortnite, when opening CHESTS (GOLD MOTHERLOVING CHESTS), you should NOT receive weapons like scoped AR/thermals/snipers...AT LEAST on your FIRST chest opening...

I think if your first chest open was always a proper gun that you can fight people with immediately in short distance - shotguns/ars/pistols/subs then it'll help reduce the RNG. It's not a major change, but I think it would help frustration for a lot of people!

I'm not going to do a technical breakdown of how glider redeploy has dynamically affected the games core elements and whatnot, because a million other people have done that already.

I am a very regular player of Fortnite and by no means consider myself amazing at the game. I can build and fight, but I whiff pump shots like the rest of us and have been sniped healing in the open many many times. I've played since Season 4, so I'm not a veteran of the game by any means. I was as an avid gamer able to grasp the amazing new mechanics of Fortnite and learn the ropes thanks to some veteran players who got me into the game. As I understood them, the mechanics and skill gap of the game were clear: Building wins the day, time and time again. Coming from PUBG, I was delighted that I could raise cover from thin air when a circle didn't work in my favor. It solved a huge problem in PUBG: getting screwed by lack of cover. It challenged and fascinated me.

Aside from these base mechanics, there were other core elements of the game that I had to grasp, and a lot of them I disagreed with vehemently. Most notably, RNG and bloom being a huge deciding factor in how well shielded and armed you were, and whether or not you hit your shots (which is still hard for me to come to terms with). The core mechanic of building made these problems I had with the game annoying, but manageable. I learned to accept them.

Epic hadn't messed with the formula of this game very much in the first few seasons that I played, but what they did add were common sense minor mechanics that seemed to make sense most of the time. I didn't feel they necessitated any advanced communication from Epic, nor did I request any such dialogue. Changes like bouncers, rifts, grapplers, and vehicles  all seemed inevitable and in place in a BR. I remember distinctly speaking to my friend about the introduction of ATK's and rifts at the beginning of season five and saying ""mobility is important in a BR"". Well, all I'll say about glider redeploy at this point is that Epic went a little too far. But that's not why I'm writing this.

I'm writing this because Epic has an issue with how they change and develop their game. Epic, unlike many other developers that provide meaningful data about the meta and gameplay trends, provides little to no data or analysis that brings them to their decisions. Hell, when they changed explosives to do 25% damage through walls, it took this entire subreddit screaming at them to get them to tell us *why*, and took another 12 hours of REEEEEEEE to get them to remove it. And on that point, they provided very vague information about what led them to that conclusion (um, we wanted to counter turtling, so we decided to make RPG's uncounterable). In this case, there was a logical way to get from point A (turtling and defensive building seems to be a tad powerful) and point B (design an aspect of the game to directly counter turtling) but they didn't really give us A) any prior information or data to tell us why they were changing things or B) any way of testing or easing into the feature. It was BAM! this is how things are now. Shock and awe, Epic, is quite possibly the least effective way of developing your game, and this incident was only the beginning of the symptoms of your developmental disorder.

With 6.2 we got glider redeploy, and like the explosives update, it was thrusted upon the community with no warning and was not optional in any way. (also, Fortnitemares dynamically changed the game in a similar way, but I have less gripes about that because it was undoubtedly temporary). Now, to their credit, Epic had been experimenting with redeploy for some time in a certain capacity. Soaring 50's became a popular gamemode because of this feature, and for a short time soaring solos and duos also were LTMs (though I suspect they were removed because of a lack of interest). However, there is almost no doubt within the community that Soaring 50s and the classic playlists entertained a somewhat different audience, and the testing of this mechanic was an incomplete picture of how it would impact the game. Again, to Epic's credit, they insisted that the soaring feature in all playlists was a test, to last only one week. One week passed, and we got a surprising message with the patch: soaring was to stay for more testing. I was disheartened as a player to hear this, and a little frustrated with Epic's explanation. Insisting that ""positive feedback"" was their incentive was not enough of an explanation. I need to know what soaring's impact was on the game, what it made better and exactly how. I don't want to know from the community, though we're all *great* armchair developers out here, because we're not in charge of the game, and we simply don't have the raw data that Epic does in front of us. I need to hear it from Epic.

This is just one side of Epic's game development process that I have a problem with. The other side is much more annoying than anything, but certainly has the potential to become just as bullshit as the lack of any insight on how they develop their game. Epic has this seemingly insatiable desire to keep pushing new things into the game. New toys. New guns. New features. New NEW NEW! Every week it seems there's a COMING SOON on the dash when I boot up fortnite. It's not that I don't want fresh content in the game. I'd love a new map and love the idea of new weapons that are properly balanced AND fill a gap of range/damage/utility that is lacking, and most importantly, aren't a flashy addition to the game that is useless and/or meant to help ""set the mood"" (I'm looking at you, six shooter). Epic has to realize (and I know, I'm becoming a great armchair developer myself) that although these types of additions are passable and don't break the game or anything, they are clearly meant to keep people looking away from glaring issues with the game and important changes to it. Glider animation and audio is scuffed? Oh look! A new AR is coming soon! Wait, FPS drops are still happening even on high end rigs? Oh wow more explosives soon! NEW POIs! Halloween! Zombies! Isn't Epic great they keep making the game fresh! 

I'm sick of it!

We need clear, no BS communication. I know that one of the most important pieces of data that Epic looks at is playtime. Playtime = more time that a play could spend $$$ on the game. Epic you've got the largest playerbase in the world and put out sick skins and dances that always blow me away. You're GOING to make MONEY! But at the end of the day, we love the game. We love the building. 

I just want to understand your decisions. Stop adding stuff for one minute and fix issues, but more importantly, ADDRESS them. Don't make us scream at you for days and days and days just to get an inkling of dialogue, and when you do communicate, go into detail! Not everyone will read it, but dang it I will! And many many other players too!

Thanks for the read everyone (and hopefully someone at Epic). The community makes this game better.

This is not just about glider redeploy. This is about how you make this game. So please. Talk to us. Help us understand. And most importantly, give us some indication that our feedback is received, and how it is processed, and how it affects your decision making.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to getting swanton-ed on by eight defaults after I waste all my mats in a never ending build fight and die from fall damage because the glider doesn't redeploy for some reason.

3. Simple Ballot, a)  keep glider re-deploy or b) remove the re-deploy mechanic c) Add 30 second debuff before you can redeploy again 

3. Collect votes over three (3) days Fri-Sun

4. Announce the results and Implement the Winner

DISCLAIMER: Given we are users and did not create the game Epic has no obligation to do this, but it is also fair to say the glider re-deploy mechanic is a much bigger change to the fundamental gameplay than just vaulting a weapon or removing double pumps.

I personally love being able to redeploy, but several content creators are not as positive about the change. Epic has always been about being the FIRST to do things (Avengers, NFL, Cross-platform, etc) why not be the FIRST to let the users decide which way to play the game.

...HOWEVER, I do greatly miss seeing TimTheTatman die of fall damage so that is a persuasive reason to remove... #WayoftheRoad

&amp;#x200B;

I have been playing this game since mid season 3 and I have found it very challenging to actually become good at the game. Every time I play the game, i always get killed by somebody solely because their skill is SO MUCH greater than mine. I barely get any experience with trying to get kills, i still struggle immensely in trying to build, and it is overall a very rage inducing experience for me. I know I could just give up, say fuck the game, and leave, but it's so hard to because I really just want to be good and I spend money on this game. If I were to actually get into a lobby with people more of my skill, then just maybe I would have a chance at getting better. I know that I speak for many other people when I say this because somehow I have found worse players than me. I really think that this needs to be an option because this game will die simply because new players will find themselves having a really bad time with the game.

Everybody gets unlimited materials, everybody will land onto the map like usual but now chests give will give powerful weapons, these weapons will include the Heavy AR, any shotgun that isn’t a tactical, heavy snipers, etc., oh yeah, everybody can respawn 

After the first circle. Pieces from the destroyed battle busses will start to fall down onto the map, which at this point we should expect structures and build battles caused by players to be scattered all over the map, the idea is for these battle bus pieces to fall down onto the map and destroy structures or kill players which should tamper with build battles and other structures

Players will not lose their weapons, when they die, they will drop ammo just like in Disco Domination, however grenades, gas grenades, and other explosives are dropped as well and have a higher spawn rate from chests

The way to win is by making sure your team has the most kills by the end of the match, this should encourage more fights to happen

So, in season one I bought the Renegade Raider, five seasons later (This just started happening today btw), the skin will no longer appear as a Renegade Raider, but instead a Redline skin. I have no clue why this is happening. I've been told it could be because I changed pack files but I don't know how to change, or even access, a pack file. 

So I came to Reddit, 'cause quite frankly, I'm stumped.

My son (11yrs old) has been playing fortnite for about a year, he loves it. It has been his longest running and current hyper-focus, he is on the autism spectrum. I love it because the community is great for him and he has chance to be social without the in person contact being required. Throughout his time playing he has always played to just have fun and because winning a match is difficult for him it isnt usually a big focus for him. He loves it and to all those that have played with him thank you for making it fun for my son. Today he was downstairs playing when out of know where I here a bunch of screaming and yelling, thinking that my kids got into a fight or something I call them upstairs to find out whats going on. I was pleasantly surprised to find out there was no fight, but my son could barely get it out, because of his excitement, that he had won a match. I was so excited for him, and congratulated him and told him I was proud of him, he had done something that he never though he could. He looked at me and and contained his excitement long enough to say ""no, dad you dont understand, i won a solo match"" and he resumed his excitement. I was so happy for him and we talked about the whole match together, and he explained it all in great detail. IT WAS FANTASTIC! Once we finished up he headed back down to play some more. I loved it, the pure excitement and joy on his face was fantastic. I just want share this because it is such a big deal for him and totally worth sharing with this community.

Compared to other games I play Fortnite has the worst currency system to obtain items. Free Pass Owners only make 200 vbucks every season while Battle Pass Owners make 1500 vbucks every season. Since these vbucks are mainly used for cosmetics there should be a way to earn a decent amount of vbucks. I think a challenge that appears every week to give 50 vbucks would be a great addition since it allows people to earn some vbucks without grinding the battle pass or buying some. They can't be stack and have to be completed in the normal solo/duo/squad game modes only.

Epic should bring back the old battle passes (Wait, let me explain) but only for the ones who bought it. The way it works is: Epic adds something that detects if players have the tier 1 skin for every battle pass (because if you have the tier 1 skin that means that you should obiously have the battle pass. Epic has done this before where it detects people's skins, like recently the Zoey skin was temporarily desabled for those who had it, so for people that bought the any of the previous battle passes should have an extra tab on the battle pass menu where if they press (for example) the right stick, they have an option to see the old battle passes and complete them, and for those who dont have them, show a lock on it.",FortNiteBR

We all have had that unpleasant park experience early game on a regular basis where we drop at a house/location and get bandages, a grey pistol and scoped ar while the guy next to you gets a blue ar pump shotty and minis. IMO it would make things WAY more skill based and balanced if everybody simply dropped in with a grey ar, grey tac, and one mini (only one clip in each, no extra ammo AND these weapons are not loaded so if you land next to somebody you just want to barrel stuff you die). Now with these items imagine going up against the guy with a blue ar, pump and minis. If this happened no matter how bad the RNG is, you will still have a fighting chance because it would close the gap on how unlucky you can get. I feel like these are the most basic weapons you should have. With this they would have to make everybody invulnerable until you land on the first drop and because everybody has weapons already we may need to give everybody 30 resource as well. While you could just run at people right away, I feel like people will still loot where they land for more shields and better weapons. The only difference will be you won't get completely screwed by rng. 

&amp;#x200B;

And no I am not going to drop at the end of the bus route and go to the farthest corners of Narnia just to guarantee myself solo loot. That is not fun. Really think hard on how often you get frustrated by dying to a guy with obscenely better loot within 20 seconds of landing. This would also help balance out early game for a potential ranked mode if that ever happens. I would love to see this as a LTM to test this out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now tell me why this suggestion is terrible because change is a scary thing. To me it seems like a better alternative than a dice roll each drop.

Extra Life was a tremendous success this year. Thank you to everyone who streamed, donated, and watched streams. While we did fall short of our overall goal amount, we still raised a total amount of **$11,187**! That is more than double of what we raised last year.

Donations are still open through the end of the year if you would still like to donate.

https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.teamParticipants&amp;teamID=41165

We had a ton of prizes to hand out to those who donated. The drawing has been completed, and the results are below. I have also attached a video of the drawing for verification purposes, if anyone wanted to see that. Please see the reminder disclaimer below, that was posted on each update thread. The exact wording is being copied for consistency purposes, so some of it may seem out of date.

For **every $5 USD** donated to the team, via our donation link or any streamer who has signed up with the our team, between now and 11/4, 12:00am EST, you will **receive 1 entry** into the drawing. The drawing will be recorded and posted with the winners approximately 1 week after the event ends. We will be reaching out to the winners no later than November 14th and they must confirm response within 48 hours of being contacted or the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Contact will be made through the email provided when donating to Extra Life. All prizes with the exception of the Save The World Game Codes will be in this drawing. The game codes will be given away throughout the event by the featured streamers.

*You may only win a donated prize one time. The Save The World game codes do not count toward this limit. Additionally, in the event a winner is chosen and they do not meet the delivery requirements of a prize they won, we will first work with them to attempt to have the prize shipped to a valid delivery address. We will make every attempt to work with them to get them their prize. If no conclusion can be reached, the prize will be forfeited and redrawn. Unfortunately, with the nature of this drawing and complexity involved, this is the best option.* ***Additionally, all winners must be comfortable sharing their shipping address with a moderator.***

##**Additional Prizes**

We were able to snag some additional Smasher Statues and T-shirts! Those have been added to the prize pool!

##**Winners**

With the above being said, here is the video to the drawing, as well as a list of winners we will be contacting!

(Re-post because it seems more relevant with glider re-deploy staying),"Hi! If you are reading this that means you took the time to check out my post about my Utility Weapon Concept so thanks! Now let's get into the Idea!

&amp;#x200B;

The Net Launcher is a no-damage-weapon (Like the Grappler) that launches a Net into the direction it is pointed at and that's it!... No it isn't silly, When the net catches a player it makes the player 30% slower. The ''Net Effect'' can be worn off if the player walks a small distance of 10 meters!

&amp;#x200B;

The 10 meters do not count if the distance is by falling.

&amp;#x200B;

The Net can actually deals damage **only on buildings** and doesn't do a lot of it (90 damage)

&amp;#x200B;

The Net Launcher is great to catch players gliding, driving or running faster than you. That's right you can actually catch a player while he is gliding! It **will** deal all the fall damage!

&amp;#x200B;

It will also force the players out of a vehicle such as an ATK or a Shopping Cart

&amp;#x200B;

The propell rate of the Net is the same as a Grenade Launcher.

**So anyways instead of boring you with all the details here is a list of all it's stats!**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

|Rarity|Building Damage|Reload Time|Re-Uses|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Epic|90|2 seconds|8|

&amp;#x200B;

Well that was pretty much it so yeah! Tell me down in the comment if I'm missing something or if you liked it or yeah!

The reason I have my inventory this way is so that when switching from your shotgun to a follow up weapon you will always press RB/R1. Also if you run out of bullets when shooting your smg, you can instantly switch to your AR. Also, the reason you have your grappler/shockwaves in the 5th slot is so that you change to your shotgun straight away as that will almost always be the weapon that you wish to switch to.

- Hit markers appear on all sides randomly so the player can't tell where they're getting shot from.
- The sound of buzzing makes it really hard to hear footsteps or gunfire.
- And the stinging hurts a bit.
It would be a good thing to toss before storming a fort or breaking cover to approach an enemy. It would be annoying to get hit with it, but you're not helpless like you are with the Boogie Bomb.

[Part 2],"Title, part 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9vlaav/my_fortnite_lore_posts_got_stolen_word_by_word/

[And image because it got removed](https://i.imgur.com/tPgDbx9.png)


Yesterday hundreds of negative comments were left on [this youtube video](https://youtu.be/7O-dMgO467c), coming from this subreddit and supporting me.

Following that, MacMacs deleted his Reddit account and proceed to delete every single comment on his video calling him out for stealing my post, my script and my images, all that I did in photoshop. Word by word.

After all that trouble, all he did was edit his description to add that I 'gave him the idea' which honestly was outrageous, all the content in the video was made by me.

Following that and the help of this subreddit, I managed to do a report for Youtube, but they never contacted me back like they said they would.

After my post got removed, MacMacs deleted all negative comments, so his video has no 'main' trace on him stealing the content from me, replies to his pinned tweet are still there [these are the ones that are still up since you cannot delete replies](https://imgur.com/a/WUxsvDf)

**His video was 200k views yesterday, it is now 500k** and I honestly feel robbed, I've seen this subreddit call out youtubers and content thieves like this many times, [right now there is a post about Ricegum buying accounts, but it isn't removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9vmrzz/ricegum_is_buying_accounts_and_heres_some_proof/) or [this one about lachan fake accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9vwmhp/by_the_power_of_reddit_i_will_let_lachy_know/)  so when the moderator told me the reason mine was removed because **''the subreddit can't help you''** I was upset.

Now I'm posting this again because I felt my previous post was going somewhere, I had support, evidence and I'm pretty sure Content Steal is something that breaks the Support-A-Creator terms, if HappyPower got removed then this guy, stealing all of my work, can be removed too.... at least.

How many times is this going to happen, how many people just trying to play the game and have fun, and we’re unlucky enough to be better than Ninja? He’s cocky, and he knows the kids who watch him will do anything he says like a cult, so enough is enough.

There should be more emotes, loading screens and banners instead of mostly emoticons. Toys/pets too.

&amp;#x200B;

Tier 1\~

&amp;#x200B;

The two first tier skins (male and female) should be a Snowman (part of the snowstorm set) and Mrs Claus (part of the Christmas set)

Snowman should have a black top hat, a black bow-tie, carrot nose, a red checkered pattern scarf with a white outfit with black buttons and his back bling should be a large rainbow snow cone named ""Icy Treat"" with the description: ""Keep em coming!"". He should be named ""Frosty"" after ""Frosty the Snowman"" (Jack Frost would be copyright). His description should be: ""Was a jolly happy soul..."" - derived from the lyrics of Frosty the snowman. Can change his face from happy to angry.

Mrs Claus should be named ""Carol Noel"" with the description: ""Wishing a happy victory"". Now while she is based on Mrs. Claus, she's not actually the wife of Santa here but a friend. She has 6 stages. Her base stage is a Christmas jumper with a reindeer and casual Christmas trousers and shoes. Stage 1 should be where she is wearing a winter coat with a santa hat. Stage 2 should have her in a full santa outfit for women with red shoes. Stage 3 should have her wearing baubles around her body like they are grenades (they actually are) plus Christmas lights around her waist like a belt. Stage 4 should have her lower face covered with a red and white/christmas bandanna and small white and green striped gift boxes as shin guards, elbow guards and as full plate armour. Final stage should have riding a reindeer with a red nose (Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer). Her back bling should be a large white and green striped gift box named ""G.I.F.T."" (Giving.In.Festive.Times).

&amp;#x200B;

Tier 100\~

This skin should be Santa Clause but named ""Saint Terror"" (Saint Nicholas) with the description ""He doesn't care if you've been naughty or nice"". His base stage should be him in his santa outfit, but his other stages should be based on the Krampus ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus)) who punishes child compared to Saint Nicholas who rewards them. It's these two figures combined. His stage 1 should be where his clothes are ripped with small goat fur grown. Stage 2 should be no shirt on and half his trousers ripped with goat and demonic features partially. Stage 3 should be where his face changes more demonically and more goat like and grown horns. Stage 4 should be where there is no more clothing and his horns have fully grown. Final stage he should have a special effect of windy snow surrounding him. He is part of the Christmas set. His back bling should be

&amp;#x200B;

The Other Tier Items\~

A Snowwoman skin with a beanie, green checkered scarf, carot nose, red cheeks, a white and black outfit with black buttons and her back bling should be a snow globe named ""Global Winter"" with the description: ""Christmas wrapped up"". She should be named ""Olympia"" after the world's tallest Snowman/woman. Her description should be: ""A frosty night"". Can change her face from happy to angry.

A harvesting tool should be a large stick with carrots on the stick and be named ""Carrot and Stick"" with description: ""Reward and punishment"", referencing the meaning of the metaphor. Part of the Snowstorm set.

A glider that is a flying snowman referencing the great animated film ""The Snowman"" named ""Blizzard"" and its description should be: ""Walking in the air"" - referencing the song at the end of the film. The glider should have animation of snow falling like a blizzard and the snowman should bear a resemblance to ""The Snowman"". Where you hang should be sticks protruding from the snowman's knee area. Part of the Snowstorm set.

A Christmas tree harvesting tool named ""X-MAS"" with Christmas lights, baubles, wooden dolls, tinsels wrapped around and a star on top. You can have the option to change the star to an angel and the colour of the Christmas tree from green to white, red or blue. Part of the Christmas set.

A Santa sleigh glider with all the reindeer pulling it with gifts at the back and should be named ""Sleigh-er "" (a nice little pun) with the description: ""Merry Christmas!"". The glider should make sleigh bell noises as you glide (like this:[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCvTPiKNvt4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCvTPiKNvt4)). Part of the Christmas set.

A female elf skin who is obviously the couple to Codename E.L.F. and her name should be ""Codename A.L.P. (Agile. Loving. Passive"" - basically the opposite to ELF where he is the violent one and she is the friendly one so to say. They should belong to a set named ""Code White (white reference the themed colour of Christmas)"". Her back bling is a giant snowball named ""Deadly Cold"" with the description: ""Small but intimidating"".

A harvesting tool that is a double rounded wooden hammer (like Judges use) with a wooden chisel hammer through the top of this hammer. It should be named ""Workshop"" as these are tools elves use in making toys with the description ""Crafty and solid"". Part of the Code White set.

A glider based on The Polar Express (a locomotive) named ""X-Press"" (Christmas + The Express) with the description: ""Onward to the North Pole!"" Part of the Code White set.

An emote based on this ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Q7sbfMFJI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Q7sbfMFJI)) named ""Jolly"" with the description: ""Christmas come early"".

Two emotes based on the first two dances of this video ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5kMMGwPpYc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5kMMGwPpYc)).

There should be a snowball toy. The fancy version should be a snowman head with an evil looking face.

A male skin named ""Alexander"" (named after the drink, Christmas Alexander""): so his clothing colour should be the colour of this drink. His back bling should be a Christmas pudding tied to a plate; so the plate is on the back with pudding tied to it named ""Pud"" with the description ""A traditional classic"". Part of the Sweet Treat set.

&amp;#x200B;

A female skin named ""Negroni"" (named after the drink, Christmas Negroni): so her clothing colour should be the colour of this drink. Part of the Sweet Treat set. Her back bling should be the dessert ""yule log"".

&amp;#x200B;

A bauble toy where the fancy version is a glittering one. Can change the colours between red, green, orange, blue, purple, pink and yellow.

A loading screen of Power Chord and Gingerbread Gunner and Merry Marauder together at a gingerbread house.

A Gingerbread House back bling for Merry Marauder - The gingerbread skins should be part of the Hansel and Gretel set.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just browsing through skins and I noticed there are A LOT of oriental based skins, and I was wondering if Epic would ever add more cultural based skins. I get that some of you guys are gunna be countering my argument by saying stuff like ""ORIENTAL SKINS ARE BADASS"" but please hear me out.

 To name a few off the top of my head: Shogun, Hime, Musha, Guan yu, Wukong, the Chinese new year uncommon skins, and not to mention that other skins have oriental based designs: Drift and Dire both have oriental clothing/weapons. 

I get that they are trying their best with the Hacivat skin and the Day of the Dead skins, but I would defo encourage them to add more!

I feel like I would definitely look forward to seeing some South American, African, Arabian, etc... warrior skins as they would certainly make the game more creative. In Overwatch, (Another game I enjoy) the characters are from all over the world, and they certainly have skins which define their character and sometimes are a mix of different cultures.

I'm afraid I won't get the dire skin. What am I gonna do? I dont have any money to buy skins, and at this point, its way too hard to get battlestars from levels, or it takes too long, I wouldnt able to get enough.

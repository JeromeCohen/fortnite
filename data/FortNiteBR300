My friend sucks so bad at fortnite.,"Ok so me and my friend have been playing fortnite since December. I am a decent enough player with 169 solo wins on pc and 72 solos on console. My pc KD is 2.7 and my console KD is 4.2. My friend has 4 solo wins on console and a 0.79 KD. I transitioned from console to PC back in early January so PC is my main platform. I just want to vent about my friend because playing with him just honestly makes me not have fun in the game sometimes. I don’t understand how he started playing this game at the same time I did and still plays it’s to this day and is that bad at the game. THATS 7 months that he has been playing this game and he only has 4 solo wins and a 0.79 KD. And it’s not because he doesn’t play this game a lot because he at least plays for 2 hours almost everyday. I mean I was playing with him the other day and I did because this dude left me in the storm fighting 2 other people(which i killed by the way, but then died to the storm). He got out of the storm and was rushed by another team and he was straight up building like a noob that just got the game yesterday like his building was that bad. Whenever I go down, the whole game is basically over because he never clutches up. He always loses the battle against another player when I’m not there. ALWAYS. He doesn’t know how to play intelligently either. When there are people in a house, he will just rush in through the front door and get instantly downed. Then I will have to save the day and rez him. Whenever we play it’s literally like I’m playing no full duos because he doesn’t help at all. During a build battle with another team, I’ll have two people on me, one spraying me with an ar and the other having a build battle with me. This dude WON’T DO ANYTHING. Then when I die cuz I had two people focusing on just me, I’ll get eliminated and when I go to the spectator screen this dude is just sitting under the base like a pussy! And when we do get lucky enough to win a game which is like never, I always have like above 10 kills and this dude has like 1 or 2 kills. And this is how it is like literally every time we win. I love my friend, I love hanging out with him in real life and all, but when it comes to fortnite, I just can’t do it. It literally makes me rage so hard playing with him because I know that if I had a decent enough teammate we could win most of our games. Anyways, I just needed to get all of that out about my friend because it’s been irking me for a while. I mean, dudes been playing since December and he is this bad, idk how that works, but thanks for reading and enjoy your day. If you can relate to what I’m saying, then please tell me in your reply. Peace ✌️ ",FortNiteBR

It will trigger the 'Championship Riven' effect.,"This is my opinion on whether the 'OG' Skins should be rereleased or not and if we had something similiar in other games.

So let me start of by saying I don't have the Skull or Ghoul skin myself but i often see people posting how they really want those skins because they are ""so good"" or ""so rare"".

1. ""So good"": The skins aren't really that good. They are basically recolours of the standart skins. Most people saying they really want the skin because they look so good , but thats simply not true in the most cases ( not all ). They want this skin because its super rare. There are skins that look waaaaaaay better ( in my opinion ofc ). But people tend to say they really want a skins because its goodlooking but its only rare.

2. ""So rare"": The super rare point of this skin is gone at the moment they rerelease it to the shop. Literally everyone gonna buy but ""because it looks so good"", but as soon as they realise its not rare anymore the people wont play it.

In the game 'League of Legends' we had something similiar.
A championship skin only available during a short period 6 years ago. That skin never came back until ~1 year ago. Everyone was bagging Riot ( League of Legends creator studio ) to rerelease that skin ""because its so good"". And guess what happened. Everyone bought that skin. U saw that skin literally every game for ~1 month. After that first month u basically never saw that skin again, because in reality there were better skins for that Champ. 

As someone who owned the Championship Riven skin it was frustrating to see that skin rereleased, because i had a OG Skin for the most time, but now its just a normal skin. Nobody plays it anymore, no one thinks its cool to have it or something like this.
And thats frustrating.

I would like to hear your opinion on this topic!

I just watched a video on Fortnite and it's current state. I'm a bit late on the response but this got me thinking about the current meta of the game and what the game should do and what it should not do in the future.

You can find the video i'm talking about here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGJ6rD3Gz28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGJ6rD3Gz28)

Before I begin, I do have high level experience with this game and am currently ranked #5 on the global leaderboards for duo's. 

Here are my stats: [https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Heavy&amp;#37;20beats&amp;#37;20pump](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Heavy%20beats%20pump)

* First off, let me say that bloom is needed in a game such as Fortnite. I think the first shot accuracy update and how the game currently works is the best way to handle AR play in this game. Fortnite as it stands is not very skill based in terms of aiming, as it's a 3rd person flick shooter. There is some skill based in aiming, but the skill lies in building. If bloom was removed, the worst players could easily laser you from across the map. There would be less incentive to engage in build fights and to try to outplay your opponent. The pace of the game would DRASTICALLY slow down. I believe if there was no bloom, nobody would play fortnite, since everyone loves the core mechanic that the game was based around. Building.

* But how does epic tackle building and make it able to be outplayed, and give newer players a fighting chance? Simple. They've done it multiple times already as a matter of fact. I do not believe items such as the ""Satchel Charge"" are the way to go. I believe personally after having some time to test it, that this item is very overpowered. However, items like Impulse grenades, Bounce pads, hop rocks, etc, are very good ways to go about this. They allow for the most skill based counter in terms of you still having to aim and know when to place them and where to, etc. When it comes to satchel charges, left click right click will kill even the best of players. **I do not think that nerfing materials will be healthy for the current game or the future of the game.**

* In regards to the recent nerf to shotguns, I also do like this change. I do think it was kind of stupid that the pump shotgun could 1 shot you. It lowered the skill gap in my opinion. As I said before the aiming in fortnite isn't very difficult. I find it more skillful for you to continuously outbuild somebody and land multiple shots, than to land just one. I'm sure you all know how frustrating it was to outplay somebody just for them to flick and instantly one shot you. That is gone now, and the player who lands the most shots, not one lucky shot, for the most part, will win the fight.

* The most recent nerf is the nerf to the RPG and the amount of rockets you can hold. I do believe the amount of rockets should have been limited in such a way, but the RPG nerf was completely unnecessary. The RPG as it stands currently, and pre patch, is not worth carrying. The pull out time really affected the gun. Without the pull out time nerf, it could compete with the grenade launcher. The RPG was always better for 1v1's, but since the pull out time change it just isn't worth carrying. It's much better to carry a second shotgun over the RPG. It'd be a lot more beneficial to carry a grenade launcher over the RPG as well, since max explosive distance with it in the hands of a skilled player is one of the more broken things in fortnite.

* Lastly I want to talk about playground mode. I'm extremely disappointed that this mode is an LTM mode. This far into release and with the current popularity and budget of fortnite, this mode should have been fully implemented by now. I do understand why epic would be hesitant as it is definitely going to draw a ton of focus away from their actual game types. However, this mode is extremely healthy for the competitive life of the game. It will allow pros to discover new things and keep the skill gap growing.

##So, what does all of this have to do with anything?

As with any game and a competitive nature, the post round &amp; post game chat was always the same. No matter what role you took on or fell under, win or lose, a mixture of words was always thrown at one another. Sometimes by foes, and sometimes by friends.

&gt;You're TRASH
&gt;&gt;You can't even quickscope
&gt;&gt;&gt;You run around with shotguns like a little bitch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Gargabe ass, noob tubing piece of SHIT
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;No gun skill
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Various forms of * I fuk'd ur mom!!*

Diverse and numerous insults of all kids were hurled, but one specific phrase was uttered the most amongst the pre-game chat..

&gt;###1v1 me

With spectators eager, sometimes an entire lobby of 18, the backing out noise on repeat before loading into a private match. 

###Gamemode: Free-For-All
###Score Limit: 30 kills
###Map: Rust

***

If you had beef, Rust was the slaughter house. If you could talk the talk, Rust is where you walked the walk. If someone in the post-game lobby was calling you a trashcan, you immediately backed out and invited them to a private match on Rust. If you and your squad got into an argument at school about who was the better player, you set a time when you all got home to boot up your consoles, and you already knew the place.. 

####Rust

***

##Jump to mid 2018

Skull Troopers flossing. Power Chords rockin' out. Brite Bomber appearing more frequently in the shop than FPS drops at Tilted. You and your squad have a dispute on who the better builder is. Someone claims they can out snipe you with a bolt, even *if* you're peak-shotting with a hunting rifle. Maybe you have 2 friends that want to play as a pre-existing team of 3, and you don't have the heart to tell one of them no.. 

###Soon, for a *Limited Time*, we will have a *Ground* to *Play* on that we can use for these various occasions. 

Once again, we will get the endure the nostalgic feeling of Rust, the *end all be all* spot of MW2, years later. This time..

At first I just brushed it off as regular BR theory stuff. But last night while I was grinding out a little STW it hit me. Every time in Save the World before you move on to the next area of the map you have to do a ""Launch the Rocket"" mission to launch a new storm shield to a new area allowing you to push the storm back.

It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility for Epic to be doing that for a new BR map.

Also note, epic has finished with their desert map assets for Canny Valley in STW as well, this could also be a clue towards another map incoming.

I'll try to make this clear.  We need more xp.  Now I understand that you guys want us as a community to play more but we all have and still haven't received the max Omega.  And the xp needed from last season is a lot less.

For example I was level 78 last season and I needed 16,000 to level up.  I looked up how much I needed for this season to level up and surprise 17,800.  That's a huge difference.  And it's hard to get that much because it all adds up for previous levels.

I'm not asking for much, maybe a double xp weekend or something.  And we as a Fortnight Battle Royale community need to explain to Epic Games what we think should happen.  If you guys have any thoughts please comment I would love to hear your suggestions too.

To fix both these issues and make mats farming at the start less of a chore is have changing mats per build.

At the minute it is 10 mats per build all the time, I think a system where the number per build changes with each new zone would work well and make mats management more important (adding another skill gap).

For example when you first land it could be 5 mats per build and then after the first storm starts moving in up it by 3 to 8 mats per build and so on with each new zone. Obviously they are just numbers I picked and could be changed but I think the principle would make building more balanced.

This Make-A-Map mode is an extension from the fabled Playground (yet to be released). 

My hopes and dreams for Playground allow you to modify all settings. Including weapon spawns (box, floor, rarity and weapon type), item drops (speed, amount), storm settings (damage, speed, location), bus drop (height, speed, angle, amount of busses) and so much more (health, damage, revival time, etc, etc). With the ability to customise these options and create our own map the possibilities are endless. 

Imagine spawning in to a new island that you can modify. Sim City has great landscape modification tools, something along those lines. Imagine being able to create your own towns, including houses, shops, chests and secret spots. You can design the map for intense 1 v 1s on duos or squads to verse each other. Upload your map and allow other people to use it. 

Personally I think this would be an awesome idea for the creatives out there.

The PC I have here is a classic workstation build - i7-8700k, 16 gigs of DDR4 and a meagre gtx 1050, mostly here to serve as a display adapter for multiple 1440p monitors. 

The thing is - internet connection is stable, but transfer rates are abysmal, so it will take like 4 hours to download the ~15 gigs the game claims to need. So I don't want to spend 4 hours downloading the game just to find out it won't run. 

Will I be able to hit stable-ish ~60 on lowest settings while sticking to native resolution (on a single 1440p monitor) on a gtx 1050 or should I just skip it and download LoL?

When I say enemy movement, what I mean is them running jumping etc. It's just so bad? It can't be my end. I play wired with 0 percent packet loss and 60 ping. 60 ping is not bad don't hate on it because ninja has 2 ping.

When they move, they don't move fluidly. They more, blink. Like your character moves fluidly. Their characters just mini teleports all over. But very small distance. It's stupid. Also, jumping is retarded and rng. You can literally line up a shot, go for it and by the time your finger travels to the button plus your input lag plus the server, they've already jumped. But there's no animation or start up for it. It's more like, they teleport 1 character height into the air INSTANTLY. Now if you had a pistol or something you just shoot between their legs, if you have a shotgun then half the bullets graze their balls and you do 30 damage. No I'm being too generous more like 16..

155,Jefforee_Liam,1530002666,8tyfxa,27,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8tyfxa/fortnite_br_suggestion_megathread/,25,Fortnite BR Suggestion Megathread,"The following thread will be a compilation of many suggestions i've read and bookmarked from the subreddit, and others my own thoughts. I'm going to split this thread into two main categories, and many minor categories. The main being Functionality and Quality of Life. As a little side note to help establish credibility, I'm a player from launch, with almost 3500 matches played. First off,

# Functionality

The first and almost definite most important thing that must be addressed is the current shooting model. I've seen a few clips including [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUkFYTxMhg) that shows gameplay from the supposed leaked Shooting Test #2 mode, which was for some reason never released, and I saw a clip from the Save the World mode with a similar (if not same) model as the link (i cant find a good clip so if someone could post one in the comments). The current model is too RNG based. We've all seen the clips of streamers having their sights linked on a player and not hitting a single shot. A better and more realistic way (i know FN isnt a realism type game) to have the shooting model is the higher accuracy and high recoil. This would require quite a few changes in AR fire rates and damages, along with damage drop off, as stated in the comments of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8tk897/every_update_epic_introduced_or_will_introduce_is/). This will fix many complaints about AR shots being so RNG based, along with pistols, as the accuracy on pistols is absolutely attrocious. However SMGs should stay the way they are, damage wise, accuracy and fire rate regardless of variant.

The second point is the recently arisen bugs with building and especially players jumping through walls as demonstrated by thatdeverguy on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgjgR_6La7k). This is an extreme exploit that must be removed, hopefully in v4.5. This isn't just with players wall edits, this happens with floors and stairs, alowing players to jump through ramps and floors whilst you try to build away from them.

The next point will be the statement on material adjustments. (I understand the likelyhood of this being very low but the [source ](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/counterplay-and-play-styles)never implies nerfing, so I will refer to it as such). Per say the materials are capped, using figures from a [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8tk897/every_update_epic_introduced_or_will_introduce_is/) cited earlier in this, 700 wood, 600 brick, and 500 metal; These caps would be far past the extreme and would extremely downplay the experience of aggressive style players, and I understand that EPIC wants to create room for more play styles, but a material nerf this extreme would be excessive. Many things heard about the potential material nerf is that it will reduce the number of players turtling and camping all game. I personally don't believe this, feel free to disagree with me in the comments but if anything it will encourage it. If players don't have enough materials to play aggressively, then the turtling strategy will become a much more popular and viable option.

Another point I wanted to make is the current state of shotguns. The shotguns are perfectly fine in the state they are in and don't need a nerf. I believe the pull-out time on the pump shotgun should be reduced after the damage and headshot muliplier reductions to the pump shotgun. As stated by Daequan at many times, double pump is easily combatted by good building, and with Tactical SMGs becoming more popular, we are seeing more and more double-pumpers being killed by the SMG, even without building a lot.

A point I won't elaborate a lot on is the current overpoweredness(?) of the Remote Explosives. They do too much AoE damage to structures and should not deal damage through structures.

Another minor point is the issue of leaves blocking bullets, which shouldnt happen as a fairly objective statement.

The rocket ammo nerf was needed as the amount of times me, my teammates, or a streamer I've seen clips of getting grenade launcher spammed or rocket spammed at the end of a game is absurd and the cap put in place is justifiable and fair.

# The last few points are leaning between quality of life and functionality, so I will put them here.

[A post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8to0vf/what_if_we_disabled_ammoonly_floor_loot_drops_and/) I saw suggested removing ammo-only drops in order to reduce the likelyhood of a player landing at a location, picking up four stacks of ammo and no gun, leaving them helpless to fights until they find one.

An issue that many players have been complaining about is the placement of the player-built structures. The guidelines for where a structure is built should be completely reworked in order to prevent situations like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8tkshg/why_cant_the_ramp_just_build_like_this/) from happening. they should attempt to link with other structures first, before going to the next suitable place. 

The last, and probably most suggested topic of this category is a ranking system. This will help new players learn the game more while still having fun and not being destroyed by Launch-Players. This should be an optional system, leaving the current Solo, Duo, and Squad games the way they are, but also adding Ranked Solo, Ranked Duo, and Ranked Squad for players who would prefer to have more action and difficulty in their games.

# Quality of Life

This is an idea I've been thinking about for a while, but also probably has been mentioned many times on this subreddit: an in game chat. This feature would help people who don't have a mic communicate better. If nothing more, Squad Comms should appear on the left side of the screen in a distinguishable color so that teammates with no mics don't have to shoot and give away their position in order to inform a teammate theres extra shields.

This idea builds off the previous and has been mentioned before. We should be able to use stickers/ emoticons while spectating a player. Whenever someone outplays me and I want to compliment them, I don't like having to find their name on the Playstation directory just to message and say GG. It would be much nicer to just throw a sticker above the spectator eye that says ""gg"" or the ""salty"" sticker.

Emote categories would also help in order to reduce the time it takes to find the perfect emote you want to use to dance on your enemies grave. For example splitting up dances/ Emotes and stickers/ Emoticons in the scroll menu in game.

Another idea I've seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8tvzqv/concept_new_menu_see_teams_inventory/) showcases a improved menu screen that allows you to view the items that the players in your party have without having to ask the same monotonous questions every game.

The last suggestion would greatly help the Fortnite Friday tournaments and has almost definitely been suggested a million times before: simply put a kill count next to the players name and health bar in the top left corner.

Thank you to all who stayed and read the whole thing.

I feel like this game now more than ever needs either an incentive to get wins (unlockable skins that can be purchased after reaching certain amount of wins) or just competitive ranked mode where there will be some kind of reward based on ur ranking performance like many other games at the end of the season.

It’s a shame that it was such a huge problem in Overwatch, and now it’s probably an even larger problem in Fortnite..

Microsoft claimed ages ago that they give developers the ability to block people using adapters, so why haven’t Epic done anything?

This is becoming worse due to the increasing skill gap.

Below are the reasons why the need to separate players is imminent.

1.	It will change the gameplay environment at lot, if players in the same lobby are with similar skill level. Each game will have a more healthy and fair competition.

2.The game is too harsh for new players and too comfortable for dedicated players. Not only new player will get frustrated, good players have a tendency to get bored/not rewarded even they won.

3.The learning curve for new player now is way steeper than it should be, because most players in their game is much better than them. Not all players are tryhards that aimed to be the best in the game.

4.Balancing changes will be meaningless/inaccurate because the players in each individual game are not in the same league.

5.You cannot make this game an Esport if the top players are not directly facing each other.

Level 63 atm was on holiday for most this season probably about 5 weeks I lost all in missed the first 2 weeks because I grinded my son's account for him before mine and then I was on holiday. I can get anywhere from 2/3 wins a day during the week and double that at weekends.

So much so that they nerfed the pull out speed for the pump? So why wasn’t Daequan banned?? 

I’m not saying any of these streamers should get banned but I just don’t understand why the sudden ban on Tfue... I personally really love his stream and I honestly think it’s great when he shows exploits. He’s able to broadcast a clip across the entire community within hours so use this to be aware and fix the game. 

Now FortNite BR has been far from a beta for a long time. They’re keeping the title to allow for speedy cheap updates but here’s the deal: what is the point of a Beta? To find the imperfections and bugs in the game so that the devs can fix their problems. Stop being lazy, EPIC. Fix your game, don’t just selectively ban people that “exploit” it.

This ultimately leads to another map. There was a game file mined at the beginjng of the season, that shows the movie rustlord watched in the Season 4 trailer.

The hero’s either die, or travel to mars to finally beat omega.

 Battle royal games are about winning so i thought i needed to incorporate a way for wins to matter while also combating how pro scrims/snipes end with players sitting in sky bases and whoever has the most campfires and heals wins. This is the system that I came up with while trying to award players who slay out while still awarding the more passive players too. This is what I believe to be the most competitive way to make fortnite. ***K******eep in mind nothing is set in stone so I would love to hear feedback and thoughts on this as this is just a concept I came up with after seeing daequan's most recent video!***

*  Must be at least level 20 that way you a basic concept of the game 
* 10 Preseason games to determine placings
* 6 ranks, 6 being lowest and 1 being highest
* Rank 6 starts at 500 points ends at 800
* Rank 5 starts at 800 ends at 1100
* Rank 4 starts at 1100 ends at 1400
* Rank 3 starts at 1400 ends at 1700
* Rank 2 starts at 2000 ends at 2300
* Rank 1 starts at 2300 and goes on forever
* Top players will receive rewards exactly like that of the showdown rewards
* One win is 25 points, two straight is 30, and three is 35 points being the max win points you can get consecutively, once you lose, it resets back to 25 points obviously. 
* 2nd place is worth 20 points, 3rd is 15, 4th is 10 (no consecutive win bonus)
* 5th place - 10th place will earn you 5 points (no bonus as well)
* To start off the game first 25 players (player counts between 100-75) kills are worth 1.5 points each because it's less random
* Kills with the player count between 75-50 are worth .50 points each because its more random
* Kills between 50-25 players are worth 1 point each because slowly its getting less rng based
* Kills between 25-10 players are worth 2 points each because its getting less random once again
* Kills with 10-5 players remaining are worth 5 points each because you pretty much have an idea of where everyone could be located
* Kills within the last 5 players alive are worth 10 points each
* Normal circle time for the first 2 circles, all the others are the same as blitz timing
* Instead of showing ""#1 victory"" at end it shows the top 5 players, 1 being with the most points out of the 5
* For duos and squads it would be team based score and ranks, everything else is the same
* If added in a private server, there would be no ranks or consecutive win bonus, but everything else will stay the same.

As someone that plays this game only for build fights, it's simply not rewarding to fight. I burn through all my mats and after i get the kill im lucky if i get the same amount i started with. I'm more excited to get a ton of  mats than any grenade launcher/c4/scar/sniper can make me. Playing to win is too easy and very boring, drop in a lowkey location, ride the storm, build with metal, get the W. Solo Duos is fun but the amount of farming required to win burns me out. I believe the game needs to focus on the building aspect more because if i wanted some stale boring gameplay I'd play pubg. As ive heard from Daequan, If the problem is too many mats in the map at once backing up servers make the storm destroy buildings/resource. However i'm not sure if that many objects simultaneously being destroyed is too much information for the servers to handle.

As i do not have close people to share this story with cause i am an aging married 25 year old man with just one friend that doesn’t play fortnite sadly i thought i’d share this awesome experience i had here . 

So my experience with fortnite is all about LTMs .This is my first season. Solos feel like a damn horror game as i get a jump scare every time i play that mode . I tried Duos and squads many times but people are not in voice chat or they drop somewhere else. So i stuck with LTMs up to where i am now (level 69 , so close to 80 hype !) 

I jump into an LTM game and i get teamed up with 3 people, one of them is a guy we are going to call cookie cause he has cookie in his name obviously😅 He was a no skin with all the basic equipment so i thought he was just a new player with no experience. Game starts and i mark a point on the map and to my surprise he follows me there, I salute him we start dancing for about a minute before looting the place, we literally destroy everyone that comes in front of us !  The way he builds, knows when to initiate or hide, pre predicting where the storm is going etc. i follow his footsteps and mind you, i thought i was “getting good” with time until i was with him and saw how really fortnite should be played.  We stick together all game long and win the LTM with around 9 kills under our belts. 

I am in the lobby again and i ask myself, why the hell not add him, he was the first person i had a friendly interaction with in this game plus he would be the first friend on my list so i start looking for him in the list and i could not find him. I reboot the game thinking that maybe it hadn’t loaded the list yet but to no avail. I accept the fact that i will not find him and go take a break for half an hour before qing again. 

Game starts and one of my teammates IS THAT COOKIE GUY AGAIN. I literally spam jubilation next to him in the starting area but i guess he was afk. I drop in the football field next to Junk Junction and the guy doesn’t drop with me. As i was looting the area there i see him running all the way from where he had dropped (guess he was afk) and we do the jubilation dance up until the storm starts moving, get back into the fight, win the LTM again and instantly add each other after this one ended. We chit chat about how weird it was that we got teamed up again and that it was meant to be for us to become friends (mind you i was thrilled i got my first friend in game as well ). He gears himself as John gets his friend in and we 3 man a squad game and  WE FREAKING WIN ! it was my FIRST squad win ever all thanks to this guy who carried me and taught me with not more than 2-3 games played with him, how to up my game and become better. 

The game is alright to be played alone but with friends the whole experience is just better. So if you are still skeptical about adding people online and thinking that they will judge you based on your poor performance, get that shit out of your head, add whoever you think will not just help you get better, but make you enjoy the social part of this game as it heavily enhances you experience. Thanks for the add cookie 🙏🏼 and thank you everyone for reading !! and sorry for the poor english here, it is not my first language so i apologize for any mistakes! 

Have a great day everyone ! 😁",FortNiteBR

It’s not nervousness, it’s something tied with a will to not die and win that causing me to make the stupidest mistakes and underperform in the worst times. 

In one of my games, I try an editing tactic for the first time, before I do the edit, I think to myself, “pull out your shotgun first so you have the right gun out when you edit”. I disengaged the edit (inconsequential to my losing the fight), and instinctively switched to my burst less than 3 seconds after intentionally pulling out my shotgun. I then edited a hole and died because the burst didn’t kill him and he shotgunned me. 

Another match, I beat a noskin to a shotgun and he has no gun. He is standing still and I failed to one hit him, it later takes me 5 shots to down him, and I lost 30 health to his pickaxe. This is so far below my accuracy for any other game. I can only think that it’s anxiety related.

How can I beat this? I know I’m so much better than these mistakes I’m making.",FortNiteBR

I know it’s only an early game weapon but it’s just awful, worse that the grey silenced smg ever was for me, which since its buff is now a pretty solid find early game.

You don't want wall hopping in the game? Remove it, don't ban players utilizing the feature.

One thing that kind of throws me off as a player that's come from Pub and CS is that you have to constantly stop to move your inventory around. 

The game is so fluid and fast as far as almost every other aspect but I hate how clunky inventory management feels sometimes. I keep bringing up to my friends that I wish there was a 'preferred slot' option as in if you designate a rifle to slot 1, if you pick up a rifle, no matter what it goes to slot 1. 

This could work with other items not being bound too because I understand there's more than 5 weapon types, but you could either potentially double bind (grenade launcher and grenades on same slot) or you could have it simply fill an empty space like how it is now. 

Wouldn't it be nice to run into a house, quickly loot everything and know that the AR is on slot 1, shotgun slot 2 and pistol slot 3? I feel like constantly having to look down at the item bar at the beginning of the game is just odd, especially if the only way to 'fix It's how you want it is to auto-run in one direction or stand still.

Is there Skill Based Matchmaking in BR right now?","For those who don’t know, Skill Based Matchmaking, or sbmm, is where the players is matched in games with people of the same skill level. This mechanic has killed several games, and is not very fun. The way Epic should do this is to add their competitive mode back, and have sbmm in there, while keeping casual untouched, and matchmaking is random.

Epic, back in February, sent out their [State of Development](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-state-of-development-v4), and one of the things brought up was sbmm. Epic got a whole load of backlash and hate for this, and decided to listen to the community and [canceled their plans](https://twitter.com/fortnitegame/status/962411873814577155?s=21).

But did they? Recently, players have been complaining how every battle is just sweaty and not fun. Build battles all the time, and never any noobs around. Epic, however, never talked on sbmm since they stated they stopped their plans in February. And seeing how much Epic has been catering to new players rather then experienced players recently, sbmm could be in the game.

If sbmm is in the game, why? Adding it into the game will just cause players to get worn out of having to sweat for every single kill. New players will eventually have to get out of their shell, so practice against experienced players will train them. If sbmm stays in the game (normal playlist, not competitive if they add that) players will move away from the game after being worn out from sweating too hard after every kill.

So what everyone wants to know is, ***Is Skill Based Matchmaking in the game right now?***

Why? Why are they so thorough with wanting to nerf building, sure I don't care if they change weapons, since that finally might mean removing the double pump, but building? That is what makes the game special! Why do they feel the need to change the resource caps? I'd say that one of the only reasons Fortnite is so popular is because of the massive building. It is the one thing that can make a battle between a skilled player and a newer player more even.

Hello I want to make a post with a few ideas on how to balance Fortnite at the current state that it is in. Most of my ideas revolve around gun play so not much will be said about building. This is the second version of this post, I will be adding some new points and some further reasoning and comments to the points already made. Enjoy!

# Shotguns:

The first topic will be the shotguns. The shotgun nerf introduced right before 4.4 came out was a good start to the balancing of the Pump/Tactical shotguns. This nerf did cause a massive problem to arise in the use of the ""double pump"" strategy or the ""Pump Tac"" strategy. Even the ""Double heavy"" has arisen as a problematic meta. All of the strategies are things that fortnite should have removed not nerfed around. With the recent updates to the Suppressed SMG and the Minigun we have seen Fortnite attempt to push the use of other weapons into the meta of the game. The goal is to make every weapon viable in any slot of the players inventory, but with this they have made 2/5 slots reserved for shotguns. Which leaves only 3 slots to use for Snipers, Assault Rifles, Sub Machine Guns, Machine Guns, Pistols, Grenades, Heals, Shields, and Utilities. The two shotgun strategy is killing weapon variety within the game because everyone feels the need to run two shotguns. With that being said the shotguns pull out time has to be significantly increased or you cannot carry two shotguns.

# Tactical SMG:

The second topic is just a weapon balance for one of the guns, it will be short and sweet. The tactical Sub Machine Gun is one of the most broken weapons of all time. It is creeping into the meta slowly as everyone realizes that it is exceptionally good. The weapon does 16 damage in it's lowest variant (Uncommon) and 18 damage in it's highest variant (Epic). While doing that amount of damage it has one of the highest fire rates in the game of 13.0. Now after hearing this you would assume the weapon has a small magazine to compensate for the shredding the weapon is capable of, but it has the exact opposite. the magazine size is 35. If you were to hit every shot with an epic variant of this weapon you could kill 3 fully shielded opponents, this includes no head shots. You are only requires to hit 12 of your shots to the body, once again including zero head shots to kill somebody with 100 health and 100 shield.. The weapons magazine size or fire rate needs a nerf in some way. In the first post people were saying ""Nobody uses this gun so why change it?!?!"" But suddenly after the post HighDistortion and Ninja started using it. Not saying this had any involvement, but people do use it.

# Pistols:

The third topic is the Pistol bloom(This excludes the hand cannon). The pistol bloom is too large to compensate for. The weapon is balanced damage and fire rate wise, but after the first shot even within a room it struggles to hit the wide side of a barn. This goes for Pistols from the lowest variant (Pistol - Common) to the highest variant (Suppressed pistol - Legendary). Nothing more has to be touched except the bloom. Reducing it by a third or a fourth of what it is now would sufficient in my opinion.

# Remote Explosives:

The fourth topic is the remote explosives and how overpowered they are. The explosives got a buff that increased the blast radius. It felt good and the explosives were balanced. Then without warning they were updated again? The balanced explosives were now able to decimate a whole building with just one. They can stack to 10 as well. The way to fix this in my opinion would be to reduce the blast radius.

# Minigun:

For this point I would just like to address the good work of Epic games sticking with this weapon and seeking it's correct balance. With the latest update i believe they overshot a little bit and made the minigun slightly overpowered. There are in my opinion 3 ways to fix this weapon. Either reduce the light bullets cap to 500 which would remove insane amount of minigun spam toward buildings. Reduce the structure damage which I personally don't agree with, but is an option to balance the minigun. The last potential change would be to make the charge up time(the barrel spin) to a much higher time to prevent just switching to it and immediately mowing down everything in your path.

# Revolver/Hand Cannon:

Now this point is rather short. The Hand Cannon and Revolver need to have their damage fall off reduced significantly. Hitting a shot with the Hand Cannon from a distance sounds cool until it does 30 damage. The two guns need to have some reward for hitting shots with them. Hand Cannons should be removed from Supply Drops.

# Rocket Launcher + Supply Drops:

The last topic that comes to mind is making the Rocket Launcher a crate only weapon and possibly nerfing the splash damage done to players off of the explosion.. This is a good idea for a few reasons.

1. Removes being rocketed in the beginning of the game when materials are scarce.
2. Brings players towards Supply Drops making more quality gun fights.
3. Makes Supply Drops worth going for.
4. Reduces the Rocket Spam problem that fortnite currently has.

# Conclusion:

Comment with any ideas you have or if you have anything to say about what i think would be good balancing. I'd love to hear and discuss some opinions on this. if you're reading for the second time the only change that was made to an old point was the Tactical SMG.

We split screened through dozens of games on my old Xbox 360 and had the time of our lives. But as my brother grew older and moved to college, a void has been left.

He has less time to play games with me and I had missed spending time with him. I’ve never been the closest with my parents either, so when he left for college it really left me feeling alone.

Since FortNite came out, this dynamic changed. Since FortNite became such a pop culture phenomenon, it pulled my brother back into gaming. We started playing together again, and since then I’ve regained that bond that we lost a couple years ago (and we’ve won 12 times :))

So for that, and hopefully plenty more wins, I thank you Epic Games and all of the FortNite developers!",FortNiteBR

Most people don't use the mic much, but they do respond to questions by dropping pins on the map or sharing supplies etc. She has even won a few times and does well calling out enimies she sees.

However today she was playing and was threatened with rape, murder, and other agregous acts by teammates. She said her teammates ran outside the cirlce and got in a large gun fight as the circle was closing and they where knocked down. She couldn't go back to rez them because they were already in the storm and she was far away because she wasn't going to run out of the circle as the storm was closing in. She told them she could not go rez them as she would  die as well. This is when theother 3 players lost it. While dying they threatened her. After they died they spectated her and continued to say horrible things to her.

 I was taken aback when she told me what happened, because usually it's 12 year olds trying to get us to subscribe to their YouTube channel or people who are playing for a good time.  This is the first time she has played a shooter  and it has left a bad taste in her mouth. She really doesn't game at all. I think it may have permanently soured the game for her. She really only recently started using the mic because she felt comfortably playing and talking, but after this I don't know if she will play anymore.

Please be respectful to other players. No one wants to play a game, no matter how great it is, if the community is toxic. Please don't let this game devople a toxic community.",FortNiteBR

You get 17xp/minute survived.

Surviving 1 extra minute gets you almost as much xp as getting a kill.

Attacking someone for a kill means risking your life, and either ends in you getting 20 extra xp or your game ending.

Avoiding that person entirely and surviving 2 extra minutes gets you more xp than killing the guy.

So why would you go after someone and risk your life? Why wouldnt you just camp the whole game for survival time and placement xp?

I once did an experiment to test whether camping or playing aggressively was a better tactic for xp grinding.  

I played aggressively, got 3 kills, and died fighting the 4th guy. I placed ~25th and got ~500 xp.

I then tried camping. Jumped and killed 1 guy who approached my hiding spot, and continued hiding for the rest of the game. I placed 6th and got ~900 xp. 

This shows that camping is a better xp grinding strategy than playing aggressively.

This is unhealthy for the game because camping ruins the flow of the game.

Why would someone want to risk their life to lower the number of people remaining when they can just hide and let everyone else fight each other?

The game cant flow if people are just hiding and no one is dying, but the game rewards large amounts of xp just for staying alive as opposed to kills.

To combat this, I propose the xp for kills is increased and survival time is decreased so that its mostly even (im not whining because i want maxed omega to be easier to get, i want kills to be more valuable and desirable).

I could not hit 5 shotguns hsots in a row and it would be normal for me. The reason Im asking people about it now is that they nerfed evry single f\*cking shotgun in the game and they mostly do under 20 damage and before the6y did consistant dmg. Look, so if im in a build fight and i have a clear shot on them, when I try to hit them it misses nearly every time and somettimes it hits and it will do 9 dmg even tho all the pellets hit him. Are there any ways I can improve upon aiming with shotguns? Please, I am losing matches because of this.

I play tactical shooters. Rainbow Six, Overwatch, you name it. CS:GO sometimes.

- Positioning (Where you are, where you want/need to be, how many angles you have covered, how many angles you can be shot from)
- Overall situational/positional/spatial awareness
- Crosshair placement
- Overall tracking (even with bloom, tracking is still very important)
- Baiting

Is anyone else having unplayable mobile lag recently? I play on PS4, but my sister plays mobile, since it's all she has. We live in different cities and it's one of the ways we ""hang out"" together living far apart.

We used to crossplay together a lot, but in the last two or three weeks, my games will be running flawlessly, while she'll have unplayable lag. We're talking .25-3 fps kind of lag. This happens about 75% of the time, to the point that we can't really play together.

Then, when I change to mobile to play with my friends who are on Switch, I experience the exact same thing. A handful of rounds will be fine, but the majority will have such bad lag that it totally freezes for a couple seconds at a time, before dropping to like 3 fps.

We are both playing on iPhone 8, so that shouldn't be the problem.

Anyone else having this happen?",FortNiteBR

Here's where I get confused- they say that the late game should not come down to ""lol just build"".  Okay, now lets think about that statement for a second. Hmm. So, from what I am to gather, Epic thinks that build offs should not always happen (or never happen) in late game. 

Okay, good so far? Now I must ask the following; what type of gameplay do you propose then? What new tactics? This is where I'm getting lost. **The games tactics and strategies are built around building.** 

So if there's no building (or build off) in the late game... I guess these ""new tactics"" will be just us sitting in the fucking open shooting our gun? You mean embracing the already RNG weapon bloom out in the open and see which person wins the coin flip? Removing ways of outplaying your opponent via building? WOW, never saw that in a game before. I'm sure plenty of tactics will arise with such shallow and lame gameplay. /sarcasm

""lol just build"" - yes, epic. That's right. That's what the games about. It's funny how the only thing that keeps your cash cow intact, is being mocked by your own selves. Your game is too much of an rng shitfest for you to just remove the one thing that shows creativity and skill, for us to just be playing call of duty battle royale. Because from what it sounds like, that's exactly the direction they're headed. 

I mean I guess I can't be surprised. Epic was never good at making online games. Remember how unbalanced gears of war was online? And who gives a shit about their other f2p shovelware. So go ahead, ruin your game. ",FortNiteBR

Nerfing mats is not the answer.,"Fortnite has been the most fun video game that I have played in a long time and has brought my love for them back. However, the enjoyment of starting something new and getting better at it is taken away by the lack of balance within this game. There are many levels to this game on which to improve on and the fact that Epic wishes to nerf mats to cater to bad players that refuse to get better and learn how to build is absolute bs. I shouldn't be able to get shot in the back by a kid camping in a house and not be able to build and protect myself. 
That being said, the gun balance in this game is already catering to bad players more than ever. The fact that I can put 4 shotgun shots in someone and they don't die and then they turn around and shoot me twice with a shotgun and i'm on the ground is complete and absolute bullshit. On that fact too, the fact that bloom is a thing is dumb as fuck. The fact I can shoot at someone standing still with a scar from 50m and bloom out and hit them 1 time, only to be turned on and shot through my walls and lasered down by the same thing is the worst thing ever.


tl;dr 

This game is unbalanced and epic is going about it the complete wrong way. Dying to unfair RNG shit is the most annoying thing in any game. I'm fine with dying fairly and being outplayed, but when a game caters to people that refuse to improve themselves is bullshit. ",FortNiteBR

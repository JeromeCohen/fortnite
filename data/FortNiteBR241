I really love this game and am quit good at it, but the current state is bad. Take it back to season 4 where we could double pump but it wasnt too OP. Everything was balanced back then. And for those who say the game is hard for new people!. I disagree I became good by getting killed and learning from my mistakes. I played the game from season 1 till 3 on PS4 then from the start of 4 I start learning on PC and it took me one season to become a really good player.

Hi! I go by Kariyu or Ivan, and I wanted to discuss the abomination known as Fortnite in the Heights. This tournament was designed to imitate Summer Skirmish and give underground players a chance to show their skill. What resulted from this event was a ton of unfair, unjust ruling and a lot of sad players. Let me explain further on some of the unsettling actions taken by Silicon Harlem, the organizer of the event. 
1. There was a shortage of knowledgable staff.
-The two shoutcasters had no idea what was going on, they commentated on everything possible (e.g: ""oh looks like player x is trying to snipe someone"" they were in the lobby..) They didn't understand the concept of lag, which I'll get into later, and they hardly knew anything about the aspects of the game. 
-The stat recorders only recorded a portion of the people that played, they didn't care to record anybody's kills, let alone mine. This resulted in a ""winners circle"" of a bunch of lucky players who had their scores incorporated.
-Barely anyone knew where they were streaming the event, it took my buddies 2 hours to understand that it was hosted by ""BeTerrific!"" There were multiple twitch accounts correlating to the event that did not go live.
-The social media managers could not answer any question, and if they did, they answered with an extremely broad and blatant assertion that could already be found in their event page. Furthermore, they purposely avoided responding to unsatisfied participants who were waiting for at least 5 hours.
2. Concessions
-The ""Fortnite Cape"" offers Hot dogs for $3, sandwiches for $8, drinks for $2. I really don't have much to prove here, it's just overpriced.
3. The (false) Rules 
-We were first promised 100 PCs, and what we got was 40 ThinkPad laptops.
-They promised Private Matchmaking, only to switch to pubs when the event started.
-The Schedule said 11 AM-1 PM prelims, they started at 3:00 PM and I got to play at 4:30 PM.
-Wins were said to give 5 points, victory royales were impossible when they altered the rules.
-Given a few minutes to set up, they said, but they did not make sure everyone was ready and started prematurely.
-They tried to improvise by changing the given rules and saying most kill in 10 minutes becomes a finalist. I checked the time once in one of the rounds, it wasn't 10 minutes per round it was 5. Fucking jackasses.
4. Gameplay &amp; Equipment
-The Laptops were not adequate to prove anyone's skill. The laptops could not go over 58 fps. There was an extreme amount of latency and you could not play on medium settings without feeling lag. Speaking of lag, ping played a factor in ruining at least 10 participants day. On the big screen, you could see someone struggling to open a door and chest, and spent his allotted minutes trying to move. He got no retry.
-No time to install drivers, many people were in the login screen when they started the game
-Pub games... if you landed somewhere in the outskirts you had no chance of winning.
5. The Players
-The Majority of the players were cool! I saw a ragnarok cosplay and met some nice people (shoutout to youngboyfreash, the professional soccer player that vapes, and the guy with the 2.5 KD and played console)
However, some of the community cheated. Players were supposed to only be allowed 1 round to play, but I saw a few people who did not give up their seat and sat the entire time.
-Okay, it's about to be hella egoistic, nsfw and whiny. I consider myself a good player, I won Solo Showdown, I played near 5000 matches, and have racked up 630 wins. This is for credibility. Some people who were playing were very unskilled. There were people that could not jump, run, nor open doors. You could tell that there were only a handful of skilled players, (I met a few and saw a few after walking around) but they didn't make it to the final. I had 4 kills in 3 minutes and didn't make it, why? These fucktards would not even bother to notice me, I tried to ask a question but these pieces of shit did not even bother to acknowledge my existence. The final circle was a bunch of fucking cheaters that do not deserve any of $10,000 prize.
TLDR: Inadequate staffing of $10,000 tournament, full of cheaters, false rules and a bunch of sad kids.",FortNiteBR

We are looking for more members for Team UNDAUNTED. We are a highly skilled competitive group looking for players of our own caliber or of potential in order to push one another to reach the peak of their game.

If you want a group of people that you can hop on, squad up with and start racking up the wins, practice playgrounds having epic build battles, learning new tips and tricks, doing fun mini-games, tearing it up in some tournaments or just to hang out with some other amazing players then this might be the group you're looking for. (Star Wars pun intended)

Each team member must be voted in unanimously by all members (including you if you make it) so that team chemistry remains at a high level. We want everyone to be a valued member of the team who pulls their own weight and has a say.

Requirements below are set to a lesser standard as we know tournaments, skirmishes etc. affect stats and sometimes you just wanna have fun and do amusing challenges (ex pickaxe victory, pistols only etc). That being said some exceptions ***may*** be made on a case by case basis.

Requirements:

* W/R of at least 15% or higher with at least 350 wins
* K/D Ratio of at least 3.5 or higher
* Age 18+
* Willingness to practice skirmishes in playgrounds, 2v2 skirmishes in squads, tournaments etc.
* Good Attitude (No egotistical bullshit, we're here to build each other to be our best, not shit on one another)
* Can take constructive criticism and a joke
* \*\*\*PS4 Only - NA East/West\*\*\*

Ever since I first played the game, I’ve loved it. I’ve played the game for 2-3 hours a day (sometimes more), maxed out all the battle passes (still working on S5 but have done S2-4), played with friends, and watched lots of streamers/youtubers. I’d estimate I’ve played around 500-700 hours over these 8 months. However, I’ve always struggled to improve at the game. After all my hours, I only have 68 wins (17 solo, 22 duo, 29 squad) and a K/D of 1.58. During season 4, I was really good with the double pump (although my shotgun aim has never been very good), and I managed to rack up 12-16 kills per win and would win a game nearly every day. However, in season, I’ve only managed to win a single solo match, and a few duos and squads. I’ve tried to adapt to the meta, and I usually use pump+SMG or heavy+SMG, yet I never seem to win fights, especially early-game when I don’t have a full loadout. My aim is atrocious and has been that way for 8 months, and it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. My building is fine (I play on 10/10 sens) but even if I have the high ground, I’ll either lag off of it or end up getting shotgunned from below in the head for 170 or something ridiculous while hitting a headshot for 20 looking straight down on someone’s head. I just need help. The fact that I’ve invested so many hours in this game and am constantly getting crushed by new players frequently leads me to raging and not having any fun when I play.

IF YOU BUY AN ITEM ON YOUR PS4 THEY WILL REMOVE VBUCKS FROM YOUR PC ACCOUNT ALSO! 

This is the second time this has happened to my account and the first time when I complained they denied responsibility ( I have the emails to prove it). And now that I've bought the burger guy it has happened again.

This constitutes outright theft by Epic games, though admittedly, likely unintentional. Though, regardless of intention; protect yourselves! and if they do not refund me, or you, pm me. Because with my proof and more we have a class action lawsuit on our hands.

Let me take a moment to say that I love Fortnite and Epic by proxy. But no company should get away with defrauding its customers.

I think this was a terrible mistake. 

What the tac sub did so great was it was extremely balanced. While it could melt if you were at the proper range, it had drawbacks. 

It performed best at closish medium range while it was still usable at super close to medium range but did not excel. What this did, was made you chose between a shotty and an ar or to take all three and lose another slot. 

Another drawback was that since it shot so fast, it ran out of a magazine very quickly which made spraying at buildings have a cool-down unlike the drum gun or the p90 where u can spray forever and makes very boring and uninteresting fights. 

I don’t think they really thought it through when they took it out of the game in place if the sub and the p90. It had a proper place in the game and should not have been touched. 

Let me know your thoughts to this topic because as of now, fortnite is very uninteresting compared to when that was in the game. (Made even worse when they nerfed the health of buildings). But yeah im kinda bummed theyve been more keen on adding new additions to the game rather than perfecting a formula which they have been so close to.

4. A new legendary explosive item that grants you 1/2 of the fall damage you should have taken when you fall. Maybe?

5. When you detach the guided missiles, it disperses into mini rockets whose damage adds to the original rocket damage.

6. A grand fortnite tournament on private servers and only major pro players and whoever wins it, the game makes an ultra unique skin based on that player. Like a myth skin, a Ninja skin, a cdn skin. Sound cool?

There are some that don't have a partner and I want to ask you.

1- Who is a lonely skin that needs a friend?

2- Who should their friend be?

3- Who is closest to their friend right now in your opinion?

I'll go first

1- Raven

2- Either female Raven or an Owl skin

3- Skull trooper",FortNiteBR

My native display res is 1920 by 1080 which i normally get an average of 120 fps. I changed to a stretched res (1440 x 1080) because I herd it is better for building and you get more fps. Once i change to stretch tho, the fps dropped to 100. Anyone know a good stretched res for building/hitboxes and fps?

Thanks.",FortNiteBR

the fact that we reached this number in such a short amount of time is just phenomenal i-im just amazed, thank you all so much

for supporting this channel and helping it grow I-I love you guys, you guys are just awesome.

so as you can probably tell this isnt really a montage parody, this is really more like a kind thank you / update video

so in this video im quickly gonna go over two things: firstly advertisements, and more importantly : the future of this channel

and what kind of direction its headed.

okay so firstly, the advertisements. believe it or not but montage parodies are actually a copy right minefield

new content is getting claimed every day. we could use something from.. lets say.. 5 years ago, and tommorow a huge company could come along

and claim that video as theres and we have no control over that. and any video we use that product in could either get

copy right stiked or lose monetizeation, meaning that all the money made from that video would get sent to the company, and not

us. the only real way to counter this is to get advertisements placed on my channel, i mean its a win-win for everyone involved

you know i get a safety net generated for myself and the company gets exposure and you guys, my sub subcribers, sit through a two

second ad that will be as short and painless as possible, so next im gonna talk about the future of this channel, this doesnt mean in anyway that im actually quitting montage parodies, its basically why you subscribed to my channel and i enjoy making them and

theres no reason to quit because im in full time education i have less time to make and upload videos it use to be weekly uploads

and now its pretty much once a month but in my opinion uploading once a month isnt enough id like to upload more than that, i mean, as much as possible

but montage parodies take a long time to make, collecting the resources, coming up with an original idea ya know, all this stuff takes

time and planning and that combined with me being in education means that they take a while to make, a good video that goes into

detail about this is rubber rosses video ""future of independant animation on youtube"" it is a different theme'd video because I

dont do independant animation, but you can still kind of relate because uploads become more infrequent; channel traffic slows down

this is why i want to make videos that are related to montage parodies, but arent exactly meta montage parodies, like I said before:

im not quitting montage parodies, its basically seen as either you wait for me to upload one video a month or i upload one video a month with a bunch of you know, funny gameplay stuff in between. A great example of this would be counter strike global offensive

but at the end of the day, its all down to you guys, you guys are my subscribers and id love to hear your feed back on what youd like me to do next,

leave a comment below: your thoughts and ideas. Im gonna try to respond to as many comments as I can to this video. I would love to

hear your feedback on what kind of videos youd want to see, any future ideas for the channel. I feel that because your subscribed

to an extent, you're inclined to, you know, share your thoughts and ideas, and have a say on what i should do next, and its really

appeciated guys. and lastly i want to thank you guys, thank you guys for helping this channel grow so quickly, in such a short amount of time

I mean I started doing videos like these just over a year ago and i would have never expected my channel to grow so quickly in such a short amount of time

just from montage parodies its amazing, you know ive been reading the comments and some of them have just been genuinly amazing

ive been told people have depression and they find these videos you know therapeutic and have enjoyed them, and lifted their spirits

and stuff and its just amazing how my videos can do that to people and that really motivates me to do more of these videos, and just thank you all so much

for giving me this opportunity, it really-it really means a lot guys you have no idea, and lastly i want to give a shout out

to all the people who helped make this video whether thats voice overs, animations, stuff like that. firstly we got Harvey Rothman

he designed my youtube profile picture, and has also designed a what the fast intro for my channel, and its just amazing. i love his animation style he is just a really nice guy to talk to, be sure to subscribe to his channel, hes got an upcoming animation

for five nights at freddys ""foxy gets hooked"", he does music production, hes all around a really good guy, next we got Hitlerspimp

hes just so talent with SFM, he designed the intro for me, its unbelivable how talented he his, be sure to check out his videos, hes just

amazing. and lastly check out creamforce for his sexy voice over he did in the video honestly he does a lot of montage parody esc videos, definintely check him out

his videos are just amazing and he just has a great personality all around. and thats it guys thats all i wanted to explain, thank you all for sitting through this video

and taking all the information in, dont forget to comment down below your thoughts and feelings, id love to hear your feelings on where to take this channel montage parodies are still coming, ive got at least 2 videos in the works right now and will be up very soon. thank you all again for a quarter of a million subscribers im just still amazed that we reached this number in just a short amount of time, thanks guys.",FortNiteBR

I have a 2.27 KD this season with a 7% win rate, however this win rate mostly comes from squads. My solo KD is 2.17 but my win rate is only 2% because I can’t seem to quite get those last couple of kills. When I play squads, I usually play with my friends who are not as good as me and I try to make the calls for rotations and fights to take. Usually I make really good calls but then other times they won’t listen to me. Today I decided to ignore them whether they listen to me or not and do my own thing and I ended up with a new highest kill game of 12 kills. I have had 5 games with 11 kills, 3 in solo, and I can usually hold my own. 

The purpose of this post is to see if anyone can help me or the other people in this community to raise their gameplay to the next level. I eventually want to get into tournaments and see if I could maybe win some money out of it. I am open to any suggestions and hoping that you guys could help out me and other in this community. 

TL;DR: Any tips for an average player to raise his gameplay to the next level and be able to consider him as one of the higher tier players in this game. ",FortNiteBR

1. It's tied to an ACCOUNT'S EMAIL instead of SMS / any authenticator app / any OTHER email, which in itself is a huge blow to the account's security, all things considered.
2. The email itself isn't even masked. I know it sounds pointless, but if it was possible to redirect 2FA to another email _with its own 2FA_ to provide an additional security layer, it would've made MUCH more sense.
3. Codes are supposed to refresh at VERY short intervals, yet it's been more than 10 minutes in between 2FA code requests, and it still sends out the SAME CODE for a single email.

**ADDED**: The account itself looks like it allows infinite auth attempts, which is another huge blow to the account's security since it encourages consequence-less brute-forcing. Would love to be proven otherwise, but if that's the case, Epic, /smh...

Taking Blizzard and Steam into account (those have their own authenticator apps AND offer cellphone linking on top of that - hell, most of 2FA-powered services offer Google/MS authenticator linking!), I'd say that this is an **Epic** fail on behalf of Epic's security team. Would be MUCH appreciated if they patched this up. I know that it's better than nothing at all, but it's still more of a placebo than anything worth the salt, imo.

Please, make it as visible as possible. We don't need any more hacking victims.

Well, with V-Buck discounts, items that you can receive, you can lower the price a little bit to make it affordable for yourself!

I have no idea how you would actually obtain these. But here’s how they work.

They are little cards with a certain item name and percentage on them. The percentage would mean how much of the V-Bucks will be taken off of your item, and the item name means that this discount is only compatible with that certain item. The percentage could be the same for all discounts, but if not, there could be Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary discounts, with each lowering the price more and more. The rarity could also mean that, for example, if you have a Rare discount, you could use that on a Rare item and below.

I’ve been running into so many kids with anger management issues in playground ltm with fill on who flame me because i just keep killing them over and over again.

This is coming from someone who is definitely above average at the game. Stop catering to casuals. Add things to the game that increase skill gap. Double pump can be mastered within a month. It’s not that hard and neither is it OP ever since the dmg nerf to pumps. It was in a good spot in S4. To add on, SMGS have bloom.

Ever since season 5 rolled out I just haven’t been able to do it... It feels like a chore now. After all the grinding of a season, having to do it all again seems like torture. Alongside having to keep up with the skill bar that is constantly being raised (PC fortnite is consistently becoming more and more difficult to keep up with).

Non of us want to play anymore, we dread it almost.

I don’t won’t wanna miss out on the season, but I’ve only completed the week 1 challenges so far.  Might as well take a break from fortnite for a while as I’m probably not gonna get the full Ragnorok suit anyway.

I just feel like after ~3 months of playing the same game everyday really crashed me out. It’s probably time for me to move on to another game for the time being.

For example, let's say you see an uncommon skin that you like, but aren't sure if you want it or need it. for, say 200 vbucks (renting price could go up with rarity), you could ""rent"" that skin for either a certain amount of time or a certain amount of games. after that limit is reached, there could be a prompt asking if you want to buy the skin.

the skin would be at a slightly discounted price for a one time offer, but not discounted enough that it's just as much as regularly buying it; you would lose some vbucks by renting, then buying. I think this would create an incentive to buy the skin (you already rented it, so why not just buy it?)

to prevent people renting it over and over, you should only be allowed to rent it once, for obvious and multiple reasons.

of course, im no expert on marketing and business, and maybe this is a useless/bad idea, so please (respectfully) tell me in the comments why this is a good or bad idea. this idea has been floating around in my mind for awhile and i am curious to know what people think about such a concept. thanks for reading!

So, the galaxy tab S4 released today and we were promised the exclusive new Galaxy skin with the purchase of this device starting at $700. 

Here’s the link where epic promised the galaxy skin for a purchase of either the tab s4 or the note 9: https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/android

Many people, including myself, purchased the galaxy s4 tablet today as today was the release date. Many of us with the main intention of getting this skin (yes it may sound stupid but some people love collecting fortnite skins). 

However, upon receiving the tablet, NOBODY has received the skin onto their account and it did not show up in the item shop as promised. Some thought the shop just needed to do its daily update at 8PM EST but that turned out to not be the case. 

This has been a massive disappointment for many and whats worse is that EPIC has yet to say anything, but samsung customer support is saying that the skin should be showing up. I’m asking for the communities support to upvote this to get the attention of EPIC so that we can get a response. 

There are multiple videos of people on their tablet showing that they do not have the skin and even a reddit post about it, but I don’t think the post has gotten nearly enough attention that is why im writing this.

Heres A couple of the videos showing off the lack of galaxy skins. Its so sad :(

BUILDING. What does any spammy gun counter, BUILDING. Every material (even though starting health has been increased) can be broken in a few hits.

Here's a lineup if you wanna win a game:

Some sort of shotgun

an SMG

A Tommy Gun

A Minigun (I don't mind the miniguns ability, I think it's fair)

10 minis

The meta should be skill based tactics, skill based mechanics and it should be about building instead of spraying and praying.

I play with this meta and I don't feel skilled or even feel rewarded for my kills because it's just shooting at someone rather than the old build battles, double pumping and not being killed in 0.5 seconds from an smg on full HP and Shield.

Build battling is probably the thing that made this game big, along with the building system altogether, so why try and stop this from being the great thing that it once was.

What we need is this:

Buildings to the old way - old hp and starting HP

SMGs when the tac got buffed during the first playground patch

Removal of the Compact SMG or a large nerfing

Double Pump - This required skill and timing and wasn't 'op' just because old timmy over here couldn't do it.

Epic are catering to casual, new players and instead of them learning how to be good they can just use the new meta as a crutch. Even attempting to build battle just ends in someone using an SMG to obliterate your high-ground and immediately kill you all with 1 clip.

Epic are destroying the game like they did for they did in a former game (I don't recall the name)

I love how epic respond to these issues and I love that they engage with us so much, but please, do something about this meta, give us a large counter so we have an alternative, chucking in a new gun every week isn't going to fix anything, unless it's a gun that can compete and doesn't suck like the Double Barrel Shotgun. I honestly agree with Daequan when he said it's Reddit's fault. We cried about the double pump and we then get a new meta, then we cry about this. It's a continuous cycle. Double pump by miles would win in which we would want.

TL;DR: Read it please. There is no easy way to explain it all.

Please leave any feedback in the comments because I want to know everyone's standpoint on this issue/meta.

I'll answer it to you right here, and that is no, FortNite isn't dying. Is it losing players? I'd say so. To start off that season 5 is killing fortnite. Not because the skins, not because the map change, but because of the meta. The SMG meta is terrible, terrible. It requires no skill, when you just get shot when your low hp trying to build but the bullets are to fast so you die. I think shotgun was fine on its own. Pump is more effective when your good with it, and if you can't aim then you could use a Tactical shotgun. Not saying all tactical shotgun users have no skill. Then heavy shotgun is in the middle. Don't feel like mentioning C4's, although they did get a decent nerf. But the smg nerfs still haven't made the shotgun meta again. C4's and SMGS don't require a lot of skill. And then comes the popular debate of Epic trying to make fortnite easier for new players and less effective for better players. Which I think is a terrible idea. No player should win or have success when they haven't worked for it. If they want to get good, play more. Then the last point for me, my friends, and some others is that the game is repetitive. That's not Epic's fault it's a battle royale game there's supposed to be one mode and one objective. Epic does release new modes like sneaky silencers, 50v50, esc. But their still is one objective and one play style (don't know how to word that). That is drop, loot, kill, win. That's it, repetitive. I would LOVE to see Epic release new game modes with different objectives. For example, Overwatch a decently popular game that has a whole different game. Kinda like COD but with abilities and a whole lot different, FPS. Anyways, each time of year Overwatch has events with a different game mode. Their is capture the flag, soccer, and 2 PVE's.

Shiet, I almost miss getting one-shotted by RPG’s all the time. ",FortNiteBR

WHY does it matter if someone’s screen is stretched or not? it’s simply a preference and shouldn’t affect you at all, if you really like myths streams but you ‘can’t’ watch them because he plays stretched you need to either just stop complaining or grow some balls and deal with it, it’s not that bad. Today i watched cynical jokers killing streamers montage and the whole comment section was about wintrrz stretched screen. it’s like, SHUT UP! it’s not a big deal! if you don’t want to watch stretched gameplay then don’t watch stretched gameplay, just watch your normal res and we can all be happy. now i’m not gonna say that it increases hitboxes or makes players bigger since it makes your whole screen wider but i believe that helps me in some way. my aim has increased SIGNIFICANTLY since i started playing stretched about a month ago. in addition to that a lot of people including me have played csgo or other games stretched for a long time and it’s what we’re used to. and to conclude this argument - no one needs to listen to the 10 year olds who can’t dickride myth whine anymore, we get it, now grow a pair and walk away from it. now if you made it to the bottom and still feel like whining about it go ahead and downvote me, you’ve earned it since this is an opinion and you were open minded to it. and if you play stretched and are tired of people complaining then you’re a hottie",FortNiteBR
317,Cone26,1533949459,96cmr5,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/96cmr5/the_bullying_needs_to_stop/,3,The bullying needs to stop.,"Before I make my point I want to make it clear I’m in no way a ‘myth’ fanboy. I’ve watched his stream as well as about 20+ others. I have a relatively neutral opinion about the lad, anyway, here goes.

I’m a frequent r/fortnite and r/fortnitecompetitive browser, and over the last few days I’ve encountered an absurd amount of criticism and complaints about TSM\_Myth. Issues over the fact he’s ‘arrogant’, ‘huge ego’, ‘trash’ etc. You know the gist, you’ve probably read it yourself and you might even agree with it. Personally made threads bashing him into the ground that somehow weren’t taken down and the chat in stream after not making it into a game due to a crash, full of complete hate, comments that he’s trash, to quit competitive fortnite and in classic 12 year old fashion, to kill himself. 

Whether you like him or not, or rate him as a competitive player is irrelevant, you’re absolutely allowed to have your opinion. Disliking someone is not an issue. It becomes an issue when you go from voicing an opinion or complaint to straight up bashing someone, or in the more hard hitting term, bullying him. 

As far as I’m aware he’s 19/20 years old. As someone older than that, if thousands of people were telling me that I should quit pursuing my career and in some extreme cases, to kill myself, simply for under-performing in something as minuscule as a video game, I’d be genuinely mortified. Please please comprehend what you say before you say it. Just because he sings, dances, laughs, jokes or whatever he does on stream, doesn’t mean he isn’t affected by it. Just put yourself in his shoes and ask if it’s ok to say shit like that, without sounding like a 45 year old mother to her son, how would you feel if someone said that about you?

Just be careful what you say to people, you’d be surprised how much it can really affect them.

If you think Tfue is a better player than SypherPK, go tell Tfue he's a great player, you don't need to bash someone to build someone else up. 

**Sidenote:** 

I've seen multiple posts with constructive criticism and in no way am I referring to them, the specific examples I'm talking about is both popular threads on reddit in the last few days and the twitch chat during the summer skirmish tonight both on the official stream and Myth's personal chat.

I'm also completely aware that twitch chat is full of very immature children that will not be reading a post like this on reddit. But I'm also aware that there are certainly reddit users who have crossed the line on here as well as likely engaging in the twitch chat bullying.",FortNiteBR

Reasons why it should be taken out: The major problem with how the circle works during end game is the fact that somebody could’ve easily gotten lucky with a gold rpg or minigun and now they will dominate end game and ofc you can’t push this team because there’s five other teams trying to kill you meaning your only response is to build.

A nerf that I’ve been waiting to see is a cap on smgs and miniguns ammo, smgs should only hold 350, minigun should only hold 500. What this will likely fix is the spamming of these weapons. The recent nerf too smgs is great but a nerf to their ammo is needed especially when it’s 1v4 or 1v2.

Just like in Save the World, classes would be a huge bonus to the game. I've been thinking about 5 classes and how this would keep the game fresh.

1) Close quarters

Players will have season 2 shotgun performance. No more 6 headshot damage, no weapon swap delay.

2) Assualt players

ARs will have 30% less bloom. No damage fall-off before 100m.

3) Farmers

Resource gain will be buffed with 60%. Double floor resource pick-up. The weak spot when farming is now larger.

4) Builder

All buildables will build to 70% of max health and will build 50% quicker. No jump cooldown.

5) Medic

Any heal-ables will be used twice as fast and a 40% more likelihood to find heal-ables in chests.

This way I think it will counter the build and pump as well as the toxic SMG meta. Every class here is important and choosing one over the other will ensure we have a multi-meta. Shotguns won't be prioritised as much, as resource gain will be buffed on the one class, but the medic could also seem appealing.",FortNiteBR

Wooden structures were nerfed to not have as much starting HP. Explosive radius' buffed. SMG's shred through any structure you place. Isn't it weird that small ammo weapons do the most DPS to structures? It's almost as Epic is discouraging build fights and encouraging the newbie with an SMG to shoot straight through all of the walls and kill the seasoned veteran. 

There is no learning curve to this. No progression in skill. Just spray and pray with a high success rate. While this is good for new players, it discourages the experienced or anyone looking to improve at the game, which should be everyone. This is because building itself is almost irrelevant. No more build fights? No more Fortnite. 
The bottom line is: people who are better at the game should have a higher chance of succeeding over people who aren't as good. This will encourage people to play more and improve their gameplay! 

While I'm here, let me discuss the dreaded pump shotgun. So Epic wanted to get rid of double pumping, a strategy commonly used by more experienced players. Good! So they added a longer animation. Not good enough. They added long delay before you can shoot! Nice, it worked, problem solved. BUT THEN they nerfed the damage by A LOT. So the pump shoots slower and does less damage? Why don't you just vault the thing rather than drive it into the ground? It's no longer viable. I hit countless 6's and 7's at close range with the pump, which is supposed to be a close range weapon. If I wanted to hit a 6 on someone, I'd use a common pistol to shoot someone on the other side of Loot Lake. Not a pump shotgun standing 10 feet away. The delay timer is good and needs to be kept, but the damage needs to be worked on. The pump is not easy to use! Make it rewarding when used correctly!

IN CONCLUSION:

-BUFF the starting HP of structures
-BUFF the pump shotgun damage, but keep the delay time

-*NERF SMG damage vs STRUCTURES ONLY*
-NERF (slightly) explosive radius'

Well now thanks to the spray and pray, or left click meta, you can't even do solo duos in some cases. You haven't seen pros playing solo squads lately, you haven't seen pros clutching up in solo squads anymore. I think that new players seeing the pros wipe squads would make them want to play more to get better, but now, they just see the pros even raging in solos! It is insane what meta changes have occurred in the past 4-5 weeks. It didn't change over time. The change was drastic, and instant. Seeing pros play solos only and not any insane solo squads has declined their viewership. Fortnite is killing the viewers off on their own game.  Way more people would rather see some crazy solo squads than boring old solos which the pros would win pretty easily. But not with the current meta, tailored to newcomers. But in actuality the newcomers don't even use this really. I see plenty of noobs in the games I play who when I kill late game, aren't even holding an smg. They aren't even using what is meant for them. But we sure would use something if it was tailored to us. That's why we build. That is why we snipe, because everything else is including so much RNG, and not having any skill gap. Of course aiming and tracking is skill too, but it isn't too hard to do. 

I would love to see either of these two things in the game in the future.

1: A nerf to the sub-machine gun fire rate.

2: No pump pullout delay, as that was to prevent something which is no longer in the game, and maybe a slight damage increase. 70-90 headshots are very frustrating.

I am also sure we can all agree that the servers need to be better. I wouldn't mind a 10 second queue time to help with this. I don't think 20 tick servers are good enough for the esport area. Or 30 tick late game. I think it should be a bit better like possibly 40 tick servers at the start and 50 late game. This would prevent those weird hitmarkers you get when somebody places a wall in front of them. It would prevent the whole 0 damage thing. It would make building more smooth, and players hitboxes more accurate to where they display on screen.

Tons of players could care less about the SMG's if you'd actually start buffing things that require buffing and not mindlessly changing the SMG's. 

Changing the magazine size of the drum gum/p90 from 50 to 40 is not going to change anything. Nerfing the damage from 22/23 to 21-22 is not going to do anything. These ""nerfs"" are so pointless, hardly can call them nerfs, let alone love taps. These ""changes"" are less than a slap on the wrist.

The majority of the community couldn't give two fucks about the SMG's, you guys mindlessly nerf and implement unnecessary changes that weren't needed in the first place. 

Start giving attention to shotguns. The double pump was unnecessary to add. I cannot see one situation to use it unless I absolutely cannot for the life of me find a Pump/Heavy/Tac. Once again, a useless gun that will probably go into the vault sooner or later. Great idea! Hardly anyone asked for a double barrel shotgun, instead asked you guys to give attention to the shotguns already in the game.

There's a timer until you can shoot a shotgun after switching to another one. This defeats the purpose of double shotgun. Great, but why was Pump + Tactical Shotgun also removed? That was balanced. What's different about Pump Shotgun + Tactical Shotgun compared to shooting someone with a pump and switching to my 50 round magazine to spray and hope my bullets land? 

Absolutely nothing. 

Allow players to use Pump Shotgun and Tactical Shotgun together, remove the timer for that combo specifically. It's so unnecessary and was not unbalanced compared to Double Pumping. There's a significant amount of players who loved playing around shotguns, (can you blame us? a lot of us come from gears of war and shotguns were fun to use, regardless of the bullshit)

Back to why the pump shotgun equip delay is still implemented in the game? Revert it, allow players to take their shotguns out as fast and smoothly as the rest of the guns in the game, how they were in S1/2. 

Shotguns, specifically Pumps need attention. You guys shit on what tons of players enjoyed about this game. Instead of increasing material health generation, and adding what are basically placebo nerfs to SMG's, give shotguns attention.

Oh also, 


Where the fuck are central servers? Hello community, why are you guys not making central servers a bigger deal? Are over priced skins really the only thing that's on most of your guys's minds to not pressure Epic into investing the millions and millions and millions x50 of money they've gained off you guys to provide players with central servers? 

I guess letting them get away with adding regional servers is okay, with their net worth/revenue amirite.",FortNiteBR

I ended up selling my older 3DS XL and other games to GameStop so I could buy Save the World and some V-Bucks with the money left over. I showed my sister the Panda skin as well as the Durr Burger skin because of how hilarious it looks.  


Last night, I left my game up while in a squad with friends to take a quick shower. I noticed on the clock in the bathroom that it was 8pm so I yelled out to my sister and asked if she could check the shop for me to see if the skin I wanted was in there. She was mistaken and thought it was the Durr Burger I showed her that I said I loved, and she ended up buying the Durr Burger skin and the rest of the set, using up all of my V-Bucks.

   - What can I say? To get a kill you had to hit your shot, no spray and pray, no camping still. Literally the best mode out their!

    -What would I change?
  ~Only weapons that require heavy ammo allowed, with an exception on revolvers. 
   ~ Jetpacks! Would be fun to add them in. (Crossbows maybe :)

• Close encounters 
   - A mode only available for 10 seconds due to sky-basing. 

  - Possible fix? Yes!
How? Add a build height limit 

• Sneaky Silencer 

  - Go back to the old days of hiding in bushes, and allows people to experience a weapon not many carry the suppressed pistol

 Ways to make this a more interesting game mode? 
  - Smaller circle on start. 

• Solid Gold
    
     - What’s more fun than having all gold weapons? Plus theirs a lot more weapons now. 

   ~Things to remove 
      Jetpack, gave no point in building.

Can't change it back for 2 weeks, and the only way to contact Epic support is through what apparently is a months long email wait period. Epic pls fix.**

This morning I woke up to an e-mail saying my Epic account password had been changed. Now, obviously I didn't authorize this change, or else I wouldn't be here on reddit complaining about this. So I reset my password from that e-mail. (It does say "" If you did not make this request, please reset your password immediately."" in the e-mail.)  

I enabled two-factor authorization and was about to relax when I realized that my display name had been changed. I went to go change it back when I got hit with the problem I'm complaining about today. I cannot change my display name for another 2 weeks. 

So I decided to contact Epic, explain the issue and hopefully get it resolved within the hour. I tried looking for an instant messaging help line, because I didn't really think solving this issue would be big, probably only 10 minutes tops. Nope. Epic doesn't have that feature. So I decided to see if I can give a support line a call, explain it to someone over the phone and get it done right there and then. Nope. No support phone call. I can only get in contact with Epic support through e-mail. Which isn't really all that helpful, as when I google the average response time from Epic via e-mail, and I see that people are posting that it's been months and they still haven't heard from Epic. 

So if any Epic employees are browsing the subreddit, please. I'm aware that you're probably a developer and have nothing to do with how the support works; but if you can try and talk to any co-workers who are in the support department to try and get faster methods of support, I think that would have a much greater impact to your game than nerfing SMGs or building or whatever the hell people complain about on reddit. 

Or, alternatively, if there is any support staff lurking, DM me and we can discuss getting details for fixing my little issue. Thank you for reading if you did. ",FortNiteBR

I also hate the rocket launcher and the Quad launcher because unskilled players gravitate to these items and they require no skill to use. 

I also think that adding health per kill will tilt the scales in the other direction. They will make better players better, leaving the causal players with less opportunities to kill more skilled players. Getting third partied is very annoying but it is almost essential for newer players to get more kills. With health per kill third partying becomes a risky proposition, because the victor will have more health than they should. 

I think health per kill is to good players as planes are to bad players. 

In short: Newer players will win less games with less kills because better players will almost always have a good amount of health from all the kills they get. ",FortniteCompetitive

10,TheDream-,1546636900,acmtma,17,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/acmtma/does_anyone_else_feel_that_drop_locations_and/,1,Does Anyone Else Feel That Drop Locations and Rotations are In A Really Bad Place Right Now?,"    Everyone is currently riled up about planes and boom boxes but no one seems to care about how the map rotations are basically useless.


Currently there are a few places people drop but with the addition of planes the map just feels incredibly small and cramped. 



What I mean by this is there are only three battles a player can get into currently in this game: 



1. Drop Locations skirmishes



These fights only take place at the location you drop at. Unless you drop tilted these fights aren't very long or extensive. The biggest problem with this is they don't happen unless you drop directly on a location under the bus route. Because of the addition of planes and vehicles there is no incentive to plan your rotation or drop anywhere except under the bus route.


2. Mid game third partying



I'm not sure how many of you remember planning your rotations while timing your looting sprees but it used to be an important part of the game. This brings me to my next point.
The reason no one lands in certain locations is because unless they leave the location on a plane, they will be instantly targeted by other teams in vehicles patrolling the edge of the safe zones. You essentially have 2 options in the beginning of the game that effects your mid game: drop on the edge of the map and rotate to the zone via vehicle or drop in the center of the map and wait out a couple of the mid game zones. The reason for this is because in the mid game people usually fly planes and or drive vehicles into and around the zones with the intention of either third partying or avoiding third parties. Intentionally taking a mid game fight is not a smart move currently because of having to deal with the zone movements and lots of third partying.

3. End Game Fights.


End game fights are currently in a weird position. I've observed 2 different main occurrences in the end game. 


A. Because of so much mid game third partying there is only a few players left and the game ends rather quickly.


B. Because of so many players avoiding fights due to third partying the end game is full of players dying due to all of players being forced together.




The main problems are as follows:

1. The mid game is in a horrible place due to third partying (mainly in planes) and a lack of incentive to drop in certain locations (honestly when's the last time you dropped Junk Junction or Happy Hamlet?)

2. The Named Locations are in a bad place because rotations and rotational battles are made obsolete due to vehicles and rifts. First drop locations are mostly dictated by the bus route. If a player attempts to land in a different location than one directly below the bus the route by the time they land half the lobby is dead. There needs to be a a change to make players land in different locations and also keep fights flowing through out the game.


TLDR: Planes and rifts have destroyed the map rotations. The map feels smaller and full of third partying because of this. No one wants to take mid game fights anymore because they can no longer predict where other players will rotate from to avoid third partying. Mid game fights are essentially all third partying shit shows and are hard to stay in control of (especially in squads).

So my main question is why do we need a gun on the most OP mobility item in the game? Golf carts and 4 wheelers don't have them and you can't shoot at one another so why does the plane have one? I get the dog fighting thing but that is what a team is for. 

At the end of the day the plane is going to be more useful than the other vehicles even without a turret. This is just my opinion. ",FortniteCompetitive

Railerik here :3

I've been obsessed with the question in the title for a few weeks, mostly because of the POP-UP Cups and the fact I've had to face better and better players while not having enough time to practice and stay on top of my game.

TL:DR: I made a video discussing the topic, but it's too long so Reddit won't let me upload (over 1.5Gb) , here it is on Youtube if you don't want to read the whole post: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpyfTQCum5k
--

That being said, it means that I can't ever really be as good of a builder, editor, or generally player than others whom spent 30-40-50 hours a week playing and practising.

Yet, I still want to do my best to compete and get high points in the pop-up cups and found myself really changing my playstyle completely to account for the fact I'm no longer capable of outplaying almost anyone.

**I think this topic might interest anyone here who has a hard time reaching 25-30-40-points during the events, or feel that they’re not improving fast enough for the amount of hours they’re actually clocking in the game.**
--

If you’re already a god, already extremely skilled, this could help you a BIT, but keep in mind who Im addressing here.

-------------
--------


I’m by NO means a great Fortnite player.
--

My building is somewhat sloppy. 

My editing isn’t always sharp.

I don’t keep up to date with all the new amazing techniques people use to break into your 1 by 1 and I certainly don’t have Shroud’s AIM.

Yet I've still been able to pretty consistently reach over 40 points in the cups by basically changing my entire strategy entering games. 


I’ve been watching and analysing loads of lesser known players that clearly have a lot of knowledge and skill but that still can’t seem to make it past that 30-40 or even 50 mark when they clearly have the skills to do so.



**THE MAIN IDEA is to get better at analysing who’s got the INTRINSIC Advantage in any given situation.**
--

Logistically, the only way you'll ever beat someone that is better than you, is by the game giving you SOME form of advantage over them.

Let's take my favourite example using our boi TFUE.

When asking myself the question ''How to beat a player that's better than you'' I always had TFUE in mind.

I got to play against him, Cloakzy, Liquid players and a bunch of other pros during the events, and those players are MUCH better than me.

In which scenarios/situations do I legitimately believe I could kill someone like TFUE?
--

Here are my answers:
--

**-Intrinsic Load-Out Advantage**
-

Given this is a BR game, there is RNG that comes at play, and this can certainly come to your advantage if you ever hope to beat a player that is better than you.

That's the easy answer. The long answer is you need to constantly figure out whats the main ''strength'' of your load out and how can you abuse that to ideally outmatch someone who's SKILL is higher than you.

**For example:**

Better player has : Gold Pump, P90, grey AR, balloons and heals.

Insanely good loadout for CLOSE range.

Bad player: Tac shotgun, grey smg, SCAR, heavy sniper, heals.

Insanely good LONG range.

Given this loadout, the BAD player should basically shift his entire strategy around getting a high ground position in the zone and holding it to pick off opponents from a distance.

On the other hand, the player with the really bad long range loadout is going to want to change his strategy to get up close and personal and maybe push players that are turtling.

Load-Out advantage goes further than that and you need to get good and recognising what your opponent has too.

**For example, having a lot of shields (let's say 10 minis) is REALLY good if you use it to your advantage by trading shots with other players.**

If you keep trading shots with your opponent, you can keep healing back to 150 while they likely won't have nearly as much heals to keep up with you and eventually you'll be taking away their ''effective HP'' to the point where they run out of shields and now you have a clear advantage for the kill.

If you have a load-out with 10 minis, but you push players up close and personal where fights end quickly, it's much harder to take advantage of those extra shields and you effectively minimise the STRENGTH of your ''build''.
-
**-Positioning**
-

This is an obvious and often talked about point of advantage.

If you are NOT great at the game, positioning can be one of the easier ways to give yourself an advantage over other players.

Dropping in areas where there are planes/rifts and using those to quickly position yourself in the zone once it starts moving can save you the trouble of having to FIGHT and OUTPLAY players on your way inside the zone.

Lots of great players will use the zone as a chance to push and pick off players, but if again, you're not TFUE, your best bet is using safe rotation methods to avoid any fighting while having to move.

Also, even if you are the weaker player, being on top of a hill gives you a clear edge over any player that would want to push you.

Your best bet when positioning is not necessarily to be dead in the middle of the zone since that will usually draw yourself a lot of attention, but being at a high-point that is *centerish* will help a lot. Let the better players fight for the ''best spot'' (top of a hill or whatever), settle for the second/third best you can find.
-
**-Situational Weakness**
-
There are PLENTY of situations in a game where our boi TFUE is at risk of dying, even to a bot like myself, no matter his loadout.

A few examples of this:

Whenever a player is fighting someone else. 3rd partying is basically the bread and butter of ''average'' players.

Mastering the art of 3rd partying can really help you rack in those precious kills/points during pop-up cups.

Also, realising when an opponent is healing is also a great way to abuse a weakness. If you hear or see a player healing, pressuring them can grant you an easy kill as they need to stop moving and can't build. 

Other situational weaknesses include when a player is looting/farming. If a player is actively farming or looting, there's a good chance they're not paying as much attention to their surroundings and that can give you a chance to sneak up and potentially snipe or get a few good shots in before they even see you.

There are tons of other situational weaknesses, try to practice noticing and spotting when players are at your mercy.

**-Defensive Power (Turtling)**
-
 What a ton of players don't seem to realise is that TURTLING or playing defensively (AKA not trying to build battle every player you encounter) is an extremely effective way to play the game.

Not only are you saving precious mats for late game, you also have the advantage over the player pressuring you.

Why? 

A player W-KEYING is effectively putting himself at risk to secure a kill, which you can take advantage of.
-

Firstly, if there are other players in the area, the player pressuring is at the mercy of 3rd partying and on-lookers that might want to join the fight.

If you're safely in your 1by1 while the other is trying to break in, they're risking being shot while you are safe.

Also, if the player is shooting his SMG, not only can you sneak shotgun shots in between builds, the player also eventually needs to reload, which is a great moment to step out and turn the situation around. 

Another thing I LOVE to do in Pop-up cups. Let's say a player is AGRESSIVELY pushing you and even if you're running and trying to escape, they won't stop following you and really want that kill.

A good way to deal with that, as crazy as it sounds, is to run towards OTHER players nearby and hope they effectively ''help'' by shooting the person chasing you.

At which point you can go back to turtling like we mentionned earlier, and your opponent is now the one in the weak spot.

Mastering the art of turtling and defensive gameplay is KEY for less mechanically skilled players like me who can't win most build battles.
-

**-LASTLY, rotations/vehicles/rifts WEAKNESS.**
-

Something I don't see enough people do is constantly try to shoot players that are rifting or jump padding while they're in the air.

Practice with your friends to get better at this and I guarantee you'll score quite a few kills in the late game or even earlier.

A lot of players use Rifts as a last resort during a fight to escape, if that's the case, they're probably low on HP and that's a free kill waiting to be taken while they're at your mercy flying around in the air.
-

Not only that, but because players are in the sky while rifting/ in planes or jump pads, you're not putting yourself at ANY risk by shooting them if you're boxed in with your roof open. 

I recommend also giving planes a hard time when they're circling in the air if you have enough ammo, it may seem hard but you can sneak quite a few shots on a pilot, forcing them to ditch the plane and AGAIN be at your mercy while gliding down to safety.

In my last game I used a hand cannon open this guys box and pumped him for 100+ damage I then wall replaced but he simply just ran out phasing through then stood on me while I tried to build up he just phased though my ramp and shot me for 100+ and I got shot from above trying to get off of him.

I feel as though even being kinda cheated a little by the phasing, there still should have been a way for me to get away from him without getting 1 tapped.

So really I'm looking for any suggestions or any advice on how to either keep people from getting that close or what I should do when they do get that close. I'm on the grind to improve so any and all advice is appreciated, thanks! ",FortniteCompetitive

I feel like this would fix the endgames somewhat, and since epic clearly hates endgames this should be the correct play, rewarding more points for players who frag out, instead award more points to players who play in a box.

I’m thinking this format:

3 elims: 1 point
5: elims 2 points
7 elims: 2 points
top 5: 1 point
top 3: 1 point
win: 2 points

this promotes aggressive gameplay to get high scores, and makes these pop ups and tours more aggressive and can show off skills in players better, as oppose to residentsleeper box simulator.

It would eliminate the need for anti-build items to be added into the core game.","I posted this in the main Fortnite subreddit, and it didn't gain traction (unsurprisingly). I'll preface this by saying I am a casual player, but used to play Halo 3 competitively when I had more time to devote to video games. I was incredibly good at it and can understand this community's outlook on anti-competitive changes because I was a competitive player once. 

So why not make Ground Game permanent? Epic is clearly afraid of losing its casual player base to the increased skill gap so they add items in that counter building hard. Not only would Ground Game eliminate the need for things like ""boomboxes"" and planes, but it would also limit pub-stomping in a way that ranked would have a harder time doing (smurfing). Plus, it seems Epic is unwilling to add a ranked mode, so why not do the inverse? 

I for one would play the game a lot more often if this were a thing. I'm not the best player (96 wins since the tail-end of season 3), and would rather not rely on cheese items to take out better builders. The casual players Epic is so afraid of losing due to their lack of building, will have an entire mode for themselves. Even the best players would have a harder time stomping their way through every game without building, not to mention the fact that those players would be playing regular modes anyway now that some of the items they hated have been taken out. 

Games like Halo 3 and LoL have all had at least three types of modes. A regular/social mode, a ranked mode, and a casual mode. Halo had this with its many permanent playlists like Multi-team (which had no ranked variant) and LoL has this with ARAM where there's only one lane, no jungle, and random champions. Both of these games had *permanent* modes that completely changed the way to play the game. I still know people that play ARAM exclusively, so it undoubtedly has kept ""more casual"" players from quitting the game altogether. 

In the same vein, Ground Game would fulfill this purpose. Many casual players (and probably Epic themselves) never imagined that things like ""build fights"" would exist when they heard about a battle royale with building. We assumed you could build some cover and build ramps in order to get to hard-to-reach places. 

So in the absence of a ranked mode, Ground Game would be the most casual friendly thing Epic could ever do. You'd have pop-up cups for the ultra-competitive, regular modes for everyone in between, and Ground Game for the ultra-casuals. No one gets frustrated. No casuals feel like they're ""left behind"" and quit. It's a win-win. ",FortniteCompetitive

Let me explain:

From what I've seen on my timeline and on reddit most pro players have the same thought process and mindset. They want to remove the items that are lowering the skill gap (Planes, Boomboxes, Quad launchers, turrets, ect...). If you're a part of this subreddit I'm assuming that you'd petition for the same thing. But if you're over at the FortniteBR subreddit, you want Epic to remove building all together and add an indestructable tank that shoots rockets and is as fast as the quadcrasher. 

The mindset of pro players and players that enjoy the competitive scene is so different than the casual (or less than casual) player. Unfortunately Epic ""needs"" to please the casuals, as there are a lot more and it just makes sense. I agree with the idea that a higher skill gap will kill the game faster, but Epic needs to find a way to balance things out. Their desire to lower the skill gap has been very evident for a while now. It explains a lot of their additions, as well as their unwillingness to add certain things to the normal game mode (HP/shield per kill).

I just look at it from the standpoint of ""how am I going to have the most fun playing Fortnite?"". And I'm pretty sure i'd enjoy it more if I wasn't getting third partied by planes every game. 

Epic should take into consideration the ideas from the respectable pro community and maybe implement them into the game. Unfortunately I feel as though the competitive end of Fortnite doesn't really matter to Epic and in my opinion it's the least of their worries. If they're going to add things that destroy the competitive integrity of the game, then they should stop hosting tournaments for large sums of money. 

Just my thoughts. IN MY OPINION, the pro players and the players with the competitive mindset know how to make the game most enjoyable

-The turret should receive a huge nerf by lowering the damage to 10-20 and receiving more bloom.
-The pilot should be more exposed when flying.
-Amount of boost should be lowered.
-Every spawn apart from the ones in the snowy area should be removed.
-Upon crashing into builds or natural structures once during a boost (Max speed), the plane should explode or atleast take a few hundred damage.

Planes should be used solely for mobility around the map and not as a weapon or to destroy builds, I think this would make planes balanced whilst still viable.",FortniteCompetitive

1. Pop-Ups: these have been a huge experiment. Each one has had different rule sets. The reasoning is quite obvious: figure out which rule set will work the best with a true ranked mode. Think of these like a beta test. Yes we all want them to be permanent, but don't we also want them to be perfect once permanent?
2. Unvaulted: why would Epic release a game mode that goes completely away from new items if ""all the want is to push new content onto us to advertise the game"". This doesn't make any sense. You would think they would NOT want people remembering what the old FN was like, as this may cause even more hate towards the current version of the game. My theory is they're testing with Unvaulted just as they are testing with Pop-Ups.

So... where does this lead? In my mind, a ranked mode that uses all of the items and weapons in Unvaulted. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I hope not. I think Epic may have a great idea of what to do for a ranked mode. Maybe the next Pop-Up will introduce item-set changes similar to Unvaulted.

It is difficult to get good at Fortnite BR because of the large number of good players, but here’s the thing, that’s all multiplayer games. Back in the day when I used to play Minecraft, I got into the PvP scene and wanted to get really good but I got destroyed most of the time. So I tried harder, learned, adapted and then began to dominate those below me. Same thing with Call of Duty WWII. I was horrible at the game same with all new players and best I got the game four months late, I had to face people who were already 3rd-8th prestige. Once again, I learned and prevailed. I quickly began dominating and became the person to carry my team to victory and be in the top position for both teams. 

Multiplayer video games that have a player vs player aspect is always going to have a skill gap and new players will have to try very hard to get good at the game. All of the “sweaty” players also were at a point where they would get dominated frequently and would easily get outbuilt in a matter of seconds. I know this because I am a prime example. I take great pride in my building and editing ability and take it very seriously but I put in hours and hours just perfecting my 90’s. Aim was tough because I just switched over to PC gaming and FNBR was my first shooter game. This is a long ass post but all I’m saying is in order to get good and succeed hard work needs to be put in. Epic needs to stop the BS and stop rewarding new players for knowing how to hold down mouse button one and pressing spacebar to crash through a build fight that had just occurred or knowing how to hit a wall with a piece of dynamite or throw a boom box at the base of tilted towers and destroy the whole thing. 

This is obvious but Epic is catering to the new players to keep them around but the financially smart move would be to cater not towards specifically the competitive scene but more towards the older and better players. Many youtubers are getting frustrated with the additions of horrible items and causing them to quit. This is only the beginning on the death of FNBR. There are still millions of people who play this game but as bigger and bigger youtubers quit, so will their biggest fans. 

The main takeaway from this post is:

     To get good at a game it takes discipline, hard work, and commitment. The “sweaty” players put in hours of hard work every chance they got to become as good as they are now. Epic is giving handouts to the new players which is completely unrealistic to real life. Not saying this will effect a bunch of people but new, young, and impressionable players will believe just because they’re new they should have an easy way to succeed. Thousands of other games force players to learn from their mistakes rather than allowing them to mindlessly crash into things and expect the bess.

There's no reason that weapons like this should be in the game. The rpg deals over 100 damage, has an insanely large splash radius and explodes on impact. 

I don't really see the rpg get talked about much when it comes to balancing items, and I think that's mainly because no one can really see it being vaulted, but I do believe it needs a big nerf. One possible nerf is definitely making the reload time longer.

&amp;#x200B;

# NECESSARY DOWNLOADS

[ReaPlugs (Compression VST Plugin)](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/)

↳ Install this into your existing VST folder, or make one in *C:\\Program Files\\Vstplugins*

[VB Virtual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm)

↳ Make sure to run the .exe as an administrator if the install comes up with an error.

[Pedalboard 2](http://www.niallmoody.com/apps/pedalboard2)

↳ Pedalboard 2 doesn't need an install, just open the .exe file, and make a shortcut of it to your desktop if you want.

&amp;#x200B;

# Instructions

To get to your playback settings, go to the speaker icon and right click on it, and then click Sounds

[*(image here if you need help)*](https://i.imgur.com/7fYk1LW.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Then, change your default audio device to the virtual cable we just installed.

[*(another helpful image)*](https://i.imgur.com/1VHcStQ.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Next, go to pedalboard2 and go to options&gt;plugin list, then click options&gt;Scan for new or updated VST plug-ins, then select the directory we installed ReaPlugins before (*C:\\Program Files\\Vstplugins*)

[*(helpful image)*](https://i.imgur.com/eLRnS1X.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

After that, go to options&gt;Audio Settings&gt; Set Audio device type&gt; Windows Audio, then set the output to your soundcard/headphones, and set the input to the CABLE Output

[*(helpful image)*](https://i.imgur.com/qh5JEU1.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

You have now routed your computer sound through an effect board. Yay!

&amp;#x200B;

Now we need to put the effect on. Firstly, double click on the background to open up the menu, then click on reacomp-standalone.

[*(helpful image)*](https://i.imgur.com/iV075M9.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Now you have to connect the compressor to the inputs and outputs. *If needed, expand the window to show the outputs on the right.* This is done by dragging the little open ports on the side and a cable will come up. Connect this to their respective ports shown in the table below.

&amp;#x200B;

|Start here|Drag to here|
|:-|:-|
|Input 1|Main Input L|
|Input 2|Main Input R|
|Compressed Output L|Output 1|
|Compressed Output R|Output 2|

[*(connections shown in this helpful image)*](https://i.imgur.com/t7g6qOW.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Next, press the little ""e"" in the bottom right of the compressor module. This will bring up the menu for the Plugin. You can use my settings, in the screenshot below, or pick and test your own while in game. Later, we will use AutoHotkey to be able to switch audio devices with a hotkey, if you so desire.

[*(My settings shown in this image)*](https://i.imgur.com/50yeGgR.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

To compare, you can press the little ""b"" in the bottom right of the module. If it is bold, that means it is uncompressed and the module has been bypassed.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: If you want Discord/Skype to be compressed as well, set the output to the CABLE, shown [*here.*](https://i.imgur.com/7oLDzy8.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

# AUTOHOTKEY SWITCHING TUTORIAL (optional)

In this section, I will show you how to set up a keybind to switch your device from compressed to uncompressed.

**Credits: This section was paraphrased and the code is directly from** [**O'Brien Labs.**](https://obrienlabs.net/use-autohotkey-toggle-default-playback-sound-device/)

&amp;#x200B;

# NECESSARY DOWNLOADS

[AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/download/)

↳ Install normally

[nircmd](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html)

↳ open the nircmd file, NOT the nircmdc file

↳ NOTE: Make sure to open as administrator

&amp;#x200B;

After opening the nircmd file as administrator, click on the ""Copy to Windows Directory"" button, as shown in this [helpful image.](https://i.imgur.com/NcrfCTy.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Next, right-click on your desktop, go to new, and click on AutoHotkey Script, shown [here.](https://i.imgur.com/hz0rdTh.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Name the script, then right click, go to open with, then click notepad, as in [this image.](https://i.imgur.com/G2XVOWU.jpg)

&amp;#x200B;

Paste this code in, and change the ""Headphones"" to your desired sound device's name in the audio settings we accessed earlier.

    #Persistent			; This keeps the script running permanently.
    #SingleInstance		; Only allows one instance of the script to run.
    
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
    ; Win+A to change Audio Playback Device
    ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
    
    #a::
    	toggle:=!toggle ; This toggles the variable between true/false
    	if toggle
    	{
    		Run nircmd setdefaultsounddevice ""CABLE Input""
    		soundToggleBox(""CABLE Input"")
    	}
    	else
    	{
    		Run nircmd setdefaultsounddevice ""Headphones""
    		soundToggleBox(""Headphones"")
    	}
    Return
    
    ; Display sound toggle GUI
    soundToggleBox(Device)
    {
    	IfWinExist, soundToggleWin
    	{
    		Gui, destroy
    	}
    	
    	Gui, +ToolWindow -Caption +0x400000 +alwaysontop
    	Gui, Add, text, x35 y8, Default sound: %Device%
    	SysGet, screenx, 0
    	SysGet, screeny, 1
    	xpos:=screenx-275
    	ypos:=screeny-100
    	Gui, Show, NoActivate x%xpos% y%ypos% h30 w200, soundToggleWin
    	
    	SetTimer,soundToggleClose, 2000
    }
    soundToggleClose:
        SetTimer,soundToggleClose, off
        Gui, destroy
    Return

&amp;#x200B;

Save and double click on the script to load it. Now every time you press **WindowsKey + A**,  it will switch devices.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it!

You did it!

Every time you open Fortnite, if you have the pedalboard open, you can press **WIN + A** to quickly switch to a compressed version of your system sound. When you're done, press it again to have non-compressed sound.

&amp;#x200B;

*NOTE: You can hot swap in game, it works and switches over instantly.*

*NOTE AGAIN: If the compression isn't working, make sure the plugin is configured correctly. I've had it randomly switch back to default settings a few times.*

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helps!

It seems like some people don’t understand that when more competitive players talk about SBMM they don’t want to apply it to casual mode, but add a separate ranked mode so fortnite can have its on 24/7 competitive mode. 

Now I don’t understand why causal players would have a problem with this they’ll still have a mode that is less stressful (casual). And if they ever felt like the competition wasn’t good enough as all the good players were playing ranked, they could do it themselves. At first average players will have the mindset as if they are not good enough because their bronze or something, but eventually as time goes you’ll win more games and eventually rank up, becoming better. 

Not just that but if epic  decided to listen to the pro players and take out the “unskilled” items of ranked mode it would be even better. It would make ranked better to as winning and killing players would take more skill. Personally I’m talking about planes, boombox, dynamite, and quad launcher.

Now there is no reason why epic should not implement a ranked mode because it wouldn’t badly affect the community but make the community happier. This is because the pros who have been asking for this are the ones with a voice, if they leave the game so will others and eventually it will die. Knowing the fortnite community if epic does introduce a ranked mode there will be mixed opinions but surely enough if epic listens a little bit those major issues would be fixed.",FortniteCompetitive

122,AcceleratorPrime,1546538236,ac8789,143,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ac8789/my_thoughts_on_the_deagle/,1,My thoughts on the Deagle.,"It seems that the **Deagle** is the flavour of the month when it comes to what should be nerfed/vaulted and so I thought i'd just share my thoughts regarding the weapon.

Currently I feel that there are two different groups who want it either nerfed or removed from the game entirely: 

**1) Pros/aspiring comp players who find it annoying to fight against, and thus want it removed.**

*IMO whether or not something is ""annoying"" to fight against should not be a factor to the balancing of a weapon. SMG spray can also be very annoying to fight against as it wastes a lot of mats and sometimes goes through turbo builds, but that doesn't mean Epic should heavily nerf the fire rate of SMGs (this would negate the purpose of SMGs entirely) or vault them. Any pro or good player has the skill and general know-how to defend against Deagle users to differenting extents*

**2) Players who has once or multiple times gotten killed by Deagle users and thus want it nerfed/vaulted as they are having a hard time find a way to fight &amp; defend against said Deagle users.**

*IMO this is entirely a matter of skill, in several different ways. Often times when I use the Deagle my opponent will not switch from wood to either brick or metal, which allows me to keep 1-hitting their builds with ease. They also tend to stay in the same build which makes it very easy for me to line up shots after breaking their wooden builds. When I myself face Deagle spam it's usually a short story as switching to brick/metal results in my opponent either end his spamming and switch to defensive mode or go full aggro with a push towards my position.*

&amp;nbsp;

**My personal opinion on the Deagle** is that it's in a pretty good spot as it is a unique weapon that rewards good aim and can be used for both aggressive *and* defensive play. Some change could be made, like lowering the magazine size to 4-5 while slightly lowering the reload time as well. 

 I feel like in the hands of a rookie-average player it's not much of a threat unless they become bloom-jesus and get a headshot in, while in a good player's hands it's something you'll need to use your own player skill against to defend against, which is honestly pretty much the case with any weapon anyways as a good player will accurately land more shots regardless of weaponry",FortniteCompetitive

**Things that should get vaulted/changed:**

&amp;#x200B;

**Sixshooter**

The sixshooter is one of the most useless items in the game. I don't think anyone will miss it and it should therefore be vaulted.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scoped Assault Rifle/Thermal Scoped Assault Rifle**

Meanwhile these items are not exactly useless they are not good. The thermal is epic/legendary rarity yet i would take a grey ar instead of it. In my opinion the normal scoped assault rifle should be vaulted meanwhile the thermal receives a buff to make it a viable weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

**Burst Assault rifle**

Meanwhile not completely useless this weapon will always be replaced by the regular Assault Rifle. It should get vaulted as it doesn't really add anything to the game. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Grenade Launcher**

Meanwhile this weapon can take a lot of skill to use properly it is very hard to counter in a competitive setting because it applies so much pressure. I think it should get a nerf by decreasing the fire rate.

&amp;#x200B;

**Boombox**

INSTANT VAULT PLS

&amp;#x200B;

**Bush**

Useless item that was fun to use when it came out. Could be kept in regular playlists but should be removed from competitive gamemodes.

&amp;#x200B;

**X4 Stormwing/Planes**

It will be hard for epic to remove these vehicles by now and they probably wont. Therefore i think that they should add a fuel option to limit the time that you can stay in the air. They should also remove the feature were planes can damage players by bumping into them. The only way that planes should be able to damage players should be via the front cannons or fall damage after bumping people of for example cliffs. They should not inflict direct damage. On top of that planes should take more damage from ramming into structures than they already do so that people think twice before they ram builds.

&amp;#x200B;

**Ziplines**

Should be press to interact.

It's simple. 

•Clean up the item pool.
This is one of the biggest things I see wrong with this game. There are so many different rarities for so many different weapons, devices, meds, shields, etc. I think that there should be only 3 snipers you can get (blue hunting rifle, purple bolt, gold heavy sniper)  This by itself reduces the item pool by 3. 

ARs need to be heavily changed aswell: vault regular 3 burst, remove blue AK (I for one think the AK is a really strong weapon and shouldn't pack that type of punch as a blue rarity AR.) The famas, as far I can tell doesnt need to be touched. Sure, no one really uses it, but this post is already too much to ask from epic.

Shotguns. Why doesnt the pump have a grey rarity like the tac? Good question. I say either remove the grey tac or add a grey pump. I cant tell you how many times I've landed on a grey tac and gotten smacked by someone with a pump, ""jUsT hIt YoUr ShOtS"" Nah. You can't really win a tac vs. pump duel unless you outplay. As far as the heavy pump and heavy shotgun, I'd say they are pretty fine the way they are. I like the heavy shotgun for long accurate shots, and the heavy pump is great for one pumps.

Devices such as the turret really need to removed. The item is very very useless now due to the fact that you can get sniped from any angle after the nerf. Boomboxes, (how is this still in the game?) Launch pads NEED to be blue, and bouncers NEED to be readded and made green.

All these changes would make the RNG aspect a little less unbearable.

•Ranked.

This game is over a year old, and there still isn't any sort of skilled matchmaking playlist of any sort. I think there should be a number you get after playing 10 games (calculated by placement and eliminations) Numbers from 0 up to 3000

0-500 Bronze 
501-1000 Silver
1001-1500 Gold
1501-2000 Platinum 
2001-2500 Diamond 
2501-3000 Master 

This would completely revive this game for me, dealing with all these terribly unfortunate RNG based deaths makes me want to quit.

•Projectile bullets. Like the sniper, all guns should have bullet drop and lead when shooting opponents. This would balance the gun pool very nicely IMO.

These are 3 solid points I believe and feel free to discuss down below. (I will be replying) ",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

I'll structure this post to keep it as brief as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll have a quick tl;dr at the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I've spent thousands of hours on COD4/MW2 playing through a developing MLG/Gamebattles scene, spent around 5000 hours on Dota2 playing ranked at a high level, and followed their competitive scenes. This doesnt make me an expert, but has given me insight on a possible route EPIC can take for a Competitive Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

My proposal is that EPIC take a mix of both the COD and Valve approach to competitive gaming.

&amp;#x200B;

# 1- Custom Lobbies

The COD games ***never*** had a ranked mode. As far as I'm concerned, they still don't. They had prestige's but that just showed how much you played if anything. The one thing COD did have was ***custom lobbies.*** This is important because it allowed independent organizations to set rules, ladders, and a way for teams to compete without interrupting casual matchmaking.

&amp;#x200B;

As time went on, rules *changed* for the scene. As the community found 3 stuns was an OP perk, they **Banned** them. 3 frags too OP? **Banned** them. Claymores? **Banned**. Killstreaks? **Banned**. Akimbo 1887 destroying everything? **Banned.**

&amp;#x200B;

They had settings for this when you would try to set a match up on gamebattles, but there was a standard ""***MLG Playlist***"" that was developing which said what can and cannot be used.You were able to create a lobby, and if proof was found that the enemy team used any of the banned items, it was a forfeit for that map.

&amp;#x200B;

EPIC would need to implement custom lobbies, where you could enable/disable items, vehicles, weapons. Boombox comes out? OP, **Banned.** Planes destroying every build battle? **Banned.** P90's OP, **Banned.** P90 Rebalanced? **Re-enabled**.

&amp;#x200B;

EPIC can continue to release their items, make changes to the game, keep the casual community happy with whatever quirky items they add, but ***let the competitive community decide how the scene develops****.*

&amp;#x200B;

Have an organization like Faceit create a fortnite ladder, listen to feedback from the competitive scene and let the settings change. 

&amp;#x200B;

# 2- EPIC recaptures the competitive scene

&amp;#x200B;

Now the one thing that may be stopping EPIC from doing this, is because they want to control the competitive scene. They'll have their name on all the tournaments, they'll dish out the prize pools, they'll be on top of it all.

&amp;#x200B;

By creating custom lobbies for the public, this would mean an independent organization like Faceit or MLG can start creating their own tournaments, and EPIC may fear that this will steal a lot of potential. But this doesn't mean all is lost.

&amp;#x200B;

For Dota2 custom lobbies were available and independent tournaments were watched. Valve didnt mind. This brought attention to the game and Valve still hosted their yearly 'International' tournament with a huge prize pool. After a few years, Valve basically recaptured the whole competitive scene by introducing 'Majors'. These were big seasonal tournaments that would lead up to the one huge international. They're now one of the most watched tournaments, while independent tournaments were still going on, scrims on ladders were still possible.

&amp;#x200B;

What EPIC *SHOULD* do is allow custom lobbies, let the community decide the settings, take that same playlist and introduce a tournament with a HUGE prize pool.

&amp;#x200B;

I can almost guarantee that every major team will compete in that tournament, and the community will most definitely watch it. Casual or not.

&amp;#x200B;

# 3- Keeping everyone HAPPY

&amp;#x200B;

By doing this it allows the competitive scene to grow, using settings that they like, and it allows the casual scene to play with all the new toys introduced.

&amp;#x200B;

EPIC pumps out their changes as usual. New skins, new weapons, and everything is available to be used. If they keep their map changes to new or changed hotspots, and NOT floating islands (unless they allow that to be disabled) then this wouldnt affect the competitive scene.

&amp;#x200B;

The competitive scene would be unbothered, continue to do their thing, and participate in all these tournaments.

&amp;#x200B;

# 4 - Ranked

&amp;#x200B;

I'll close out with an explanation of why I think ranked wouldn't be the best option. It's best to understand this from a realistic perspective, and see how EPIC thinks.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, EPIC wants to secure their bag. They're making money right now, they don't want to implement *ANYTHING* that may discourage someone from playing the game. Sure this would boost some gametime for competitive gamers, but you introduce an element of a 7 year old wondering why he's rank wood, and his friends are rank stone, and ninja is diamond. They just want to keep 7 year old Johnny happy, playing the game, begging mom to buy a skin and battle pass. They don't want him to get upset and quit, they don't want him to start getting competitive and frustrated. they don't want his 13 year old puberty hormone brother yelling at their mom because he's frustrated that he can't break out of his ""HELL GOLD TIER SCRUBS"".

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, rank works in plenty of games. But I think keeping these pop-up cups that seem more like ""competitive challenges"" than a full ranked system would keep everything ok for now.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, at high level Dota2, it would easily take 7 minutes to find a match with 10 people around the same rank, and even then it would be imbalanced. Finding 100 would either take waaaaay longer, or would still have a wide variety of skill.

&amp;#x200B;

Keep the competitive scene in custom lobbies, and not in a ranked mode.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tl;dr.**

**Implement custom lobbies.**

**Let the comp community decide the settings.**

**EPIC copies these settings, creates tournament with HUGE prize pool.**

**Competitive scene happy.**

**EPIC still releases their quirky updates.**

**Casual scene happy with new toys.**

**Ranked may cause playerbase disrubtion/stir the pot.**

**EPIC no-likey playerbase disrubtion, leave as is.**

&amp;#x200B;

That's just what I think EPIC ***SHOULD*** do***.*** Whether or not they do something like that... who knows.. They may keep things as it is, with a monopoly on the competitive scene, and it never gets to fully bloom to its potential.

&amp;#x200B;

MrWabbit

Here’s my suggestion.

- Reduce damage Hand Cannon does to Brick/Meal so you can actually have a counter option when someone spams their hand cannon. This will reward people who can switch to brick or metal in the middle of the fight.

Personally I think the damage the hand cannon does is fine, but with the loot pool being over saturated. You most likely won’t find yourself at 200HP. 

- Reduce the damage the hand cannon does at mid-range headshot to 125 from 150. 

In most of the games I play, I’m almost never at 200HP because I keep pulling balloons/boom boxes from chests. Changing the headshot damage from 150 to 125 or 120, will give players a chance at fighting

TLDR: Hand cannon shouldn’t 1 shot brick/metal as they’re being built and Headshot damage mid-range should be 125/120 since most players are at 150HP these days due to loot pool being oversaturated. ",FortniteCompetitive

With your builds you can mix in the other huge skills in fortnite that makes great players so with your builds you can mix in, (re)positioning, game sense, and then your average aim or great aim to set you up for the victory. 

Im mainly thinking about this in terms of matches where player(s) come and keep on.

Why are rarities a thing if the rarity colors are not accurately represented. 

I feel like this happens with guns as well. For example, six shooters (green - purple) drop like candy, but other guns at lower rarities seem to drop way less. 

Should not all common weapons have the same drop % among common weapon spawns? All uncommon items should have the same drop % among uncommon items. So on and so forth.

I’m a solid player (console), but by no means great, but feel like the last few weeks I’ve really been able to improve by reading some things here, thinking more, and reviewing VODs. I’ve been able to win a lot more the last two weeks, and have moved closer to being able to pubstomp. I’ll share a list of the things that have noticed and hope y’all add any thoughts you have for those of us that are almost good enough to slay out / carry in duos/squads. Even if some of these seem sorta basic, I feel like focusing more on them can really help some of us take the next step towards being better. 

 - First thing, and definitely the biggest one for me - really focusing on minimizing the damage you take. This goes for going against bots and really strong players. Even when I’m playing well, I would find I don’t block off people and edit and instead just take the 50/50 way too often. This isn’t even totally about being third partied - being smarter helps so much against really good players where I might survive with 30 health instead of dying. 

- Next thing for me was paying attention to angles in fights. Learning to anticipate and really paying attention to the split second where someone might expose themself when building. Have your crosshair ready before they appear, and get the shot in even if it’s just a chip for 30 or so, every bit helps. 

- Don’t be overconfident when peeking. This goes with minimizing damage, but don’t get too hung up on outaiming / outblooming in AR fights. Take cover, get some damage in, and get a good push once you get that damage

- Cone people’s ramps - a lot of decent/good players won’t automatically come jump, and getting too used to this thread and pros just jumping to the side isn’t realistic to expect all the time, especially on console. I never used to do this that often, but I’ve tried to make sure I do it whenever I can and it’s helped a ton

- Play slow - it’s too easy to get caught up seeing great plays here and not be able to execute them as fast if you haven’t practiced it enough. Slow is smooth, smooth is fast. You’ll see yourself holding high ground much better and protecting yourself better too

- confident but humble - always be confident, but never underestimate. Do what you know, and trust yourself when pressure is on. And always die with a good attitude

- review your VODs - beating a dead horse here, but this matters just as much to us pretty good players as it does to the pros. Do it, you won’t believe how much you learn 


Sorry for the super long post, and I’m by no means u/convertibleFN, but I hope this helps anyone who’s almost there but missing just a few things to be closer to competitive. Please leave any feedback y’all have or anything you did that helped you get to that “next level” when playing. I don’t think this is at all the end all be all guide to this, but if it helps anyone else I think it’s a success. 

TLDR: focus on taking less damage, learn to anticipate, always do the basics, and slow it down to think. Good luck y’all and thanks

How many times have we went through asking epic games to remove shit out of the game? I'll begin:jet pack,guided missiles, fortnitemares,zombies, rpg doing damage through walls, redeploy glider, planes, swords, boom boxes, spam meta season 5. This actually makes me wonder:do you even test the items you add? We can also see that epic games is trying to nerf the turtle meta(not seeing through edits, guided missile and rpg damage through builds) but why? Is ANYONE asking for a turtle meta nerf? Remember how economics work supply and demand. I tbh find it so unfortunate that a company like epic games had luck with fortnite, honestly every company would've been better off with fortnite. Epic games needs to stop adding items to the game because I think that they feel a kind of responsibility to add something every week. 

1= make traps do 145 damage so that you won't die instantly if you have 150 shields

2= Give the balloons a GODDAMN sound.

3=make planes only a mobility item and make them very sensitive just like in gta 5 ( this would just not prevent third partying).

4=Reduce the spawn rate of boom boxes by 1.

5= Vault the six shooter and fill in that spot with a silenced or tactical smg.

6= Shield per kill would help a lot against third partying meta and lack of shields.

Basically something I’ve been noticing ever since planes have been implemented is a really annoying balance and concentration of players at specific places. 

What I’m saying is that usually around storm boundaries during closing times, there will be 4, 5, even 6 teams at one place because planes literally just let people go anywhere anytime.

I get it, third parties are a part of the game, but with so much mobility, the game is enabling 5th and 6th parties, and it’s kind of ridiculous.  

It makes rotating in pubs super annoying and if you’re playing for kills, great then slay out and kill 7 players at once, awesome. You do have to be on top of your game the entire situation, and really don’t have a lot of room to take damage in these situations, mostly because you don’t have time to heal up between fights because there literally is no in between. 

I often find me and my teammate(s) getting unintentionally separated during these ordeals, one of us getting killed and bm’ed, and only one of us making it out. 

Honestly just asking if you guys are noticing this too? And do you have a problem with it? Personally I don’t like it, and while I understand the importance of mobility, I think the planes allow a little bit too much. ",FortniteCompetitive

2. The scrim meta use to be heavy snipe plus double barrel to kill someone unexpectedly but now all I need is deagle pump which is way more common then the heavy sniper (this is way more skilled to die by because with the sniper you only have one try)

My friend has an FX-8350 and says he never lags like consistently gets 144, I want something like this but I can't trust AMD I just feel like it'll blow up on me or some shit.

Everyone. Plays. So. Passive.

The standard battles are obnoxious and feel so different. Everyone keeps their distance and is so afraid to fight and push. Every battle feels like it takes place at midish range because no one wants to push and get close. Everything is outside of throwable range. Each team just builds a bit and takes little shots behind cover and it’s BORING. Whenever I try to push, just out of boredom, I can barely do so because they are trained on shooting down my builds and pushing me away out of fear I’ll get to close. Honestly the majority of my battles (other than the first drop and final circle) is all mid range garbage. For me personally, it’s also the types of battles I dislike the most because it’s all up the the luck of the bloom. Build, bloom shots, hits, duck back behind cover, heal, repeat. 

The other super passive nature of everyone in “Events” is the planes. Ugh planes. Every single game I play there are at least a couple teams simply flying in circles above waiting for people to die and waiting for the circles to close in further and further. If you want to take shots the plane, and hopes to possibly blow it up, you might draw attention and get shot by other teams around you. Or that plane might see you and you might get swept by them, especially if the team is in separate planes. Last night in duos though people mainly just used planes as portable rift and a means to escape everyone from below. Planes were flying non stop, but not really aggressively as much as to just wait it out to try to get those placement points. My brother and I really only use the planes to get out of our initial drop area if it was far from the Circle. But almost every single game we played there was a plane flying with 10 or less people alive, let alone the fact that their are multiple teams flying planes throughout the entire game just to NOT get killed and fly away from danger.

On top of that, I’ve never had so many teams rift away, launch pad away, fly away, etc. then in Events mode. When ever we would get the jump on another team they would often just rift away to escape instead of fight.

What are the more infuriating and obnoxious things that I noticed an event mode is how everyone always runs away to their teammate. I know everyone wants to get a good placement and no one wants to die, I get that. And the stakes are different and the standard mode. But I can’t even tell you how many times a team of two would be separated and we get the jump on one guy only for him to literally run away his teammate for back up well not even firing a single bullet back. All the player would do is just build launch pad, build, escape, etc until the teammate finally gets there. And with the luck of the bloom, sometimes you’re able to take the player down, many times they escape to the teammates safety. And then the same boring midrange battle takes place where everyone is just hiding behind cover and barely moving. 

People also survive SO much longer in events because they run, hide, heal, and play so passive. No one goes for the high risk high reward plays. One of our games last night was a hilarious example. The circle was moving, MOVING, meaning that we are in the final circles here and the whole circle is shifting (not shrinking) and 20 people were alive! 20!!! We were in a little bit of an odd area right outside of pleasant, but I have never seen that many people alive at that stage of the game. A shifting circle usually means there are 5 people left? 10 max? But 20!? We took down a team of two, I barely survived but my teammate didn’t make it, and I was then killed by two guys who had 0 kills and 1 kill, so I was the first, because they were hiding in bushes on the bottom of the hill waiting for me to be running from the storm... I died with 15 alive still. 

It was VERY rare that the game ever felt like the normal Fortnite (whatever normal is anymore). I took a break from playing Fortnite super hardcore, but the events mode has had me excited to come back and hope to do well. The problem is that everyone plays so passive and the games balance just sucks when everyone is playing like this. Rifts just to run away. Planes flying as high as possible to avoid confrontation. Battles being super mid-range because no one wants to push. The bloom never feeling so annoying because all of the battles revolve around it.

The whole thing just feels so different and obnoxious. Even early game I have so many people running away instead of fighting. In the game lets them run away with all of the mechanics. The only time the game finally feels normal is when there are maybe five or six people left and the storm is really forcing everyone to fight. Then it finally gets into regular good all build battles that made me fall in love with the game. It finally has that great balance of made in close range confrontations. But good luck even getting to that place with how everyone else is playing. And have fun for 25 minutes waiting for the game to get interesting in the final seconds.

Idk, maybe it’s just me? Does the game feel DRASTICALLY different in Events to anyone else? I’m also aware that the super talented players out there can probably still just clean up everyone. But me, as someone who would consider themselves above average and that’s about it, it’s infuriating that the game feels so different and that everyone plays so differently and that the game’s mechanics allow for such random luck based battles that just aren’t fun.",FortniteCompetitive

Tfue has poisoned this community. Here’s Why.

Turner “Tfue” Tenney and his family are known around the area to discriminate against minorities. This provides a bad example to the rather young playerbase of Fortnite: Battle Royale.

His whole brand is based on toxicity and hate toward bad players and minorities in developing countries. I can’t fathom watching Tfue for a **minute** without closing my eyes and keeping myself from watching this unfold before me.

Tfue is the most disrespectful, toxic human being the gaming community has seen in years and it’s time to stop him. For once, will the Fortnite Competitive community come together and stop Tfue?

Make the change.

&gt;Ban Tfue from participating in Fortnite tournaments

262,Afro_ps,1546386703,abnio5,42,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/abnio5/the_real_reason_why_epic_is_nerfing_building/,1,The Real Reason Why Epic is Nerfing Building,"Preface: Not at all trying to bash/villianise epic here, so sorry if it may come off that way. And i understand that epic isn't a monolith, so when i refer to epic i'm talking about the team that hold creative direction of the game :)

(You might as well read the TLDR cos I feel like it sums up my point pretty well)

I have been thinking about the possible reasons as to why Epic wants to nerf building so much, and I think i've arrived at the most plausible conclusions.

If you think about it, the build battle meta was not made by Epic, the fort meta was made by Epic. Build battling is a meta made by the player base, and i think directly contradicts the visions Epic had when going into this BR. Looking back on the first official trailer for fortnite, towards the end of the trailer you see squads in forts, shooting at each other from a distance. This is what Epic envisioned buiding to be used for. I think this is further supported by the introduction of the Port-a-Fort and the Port-a-Fortress.
 
However Epic soon realised that building was being used in a different manner to what they wanted, as we the player base used fast building for close quarter combat instead of defense. Epic tried and is trying to promote the building of forts with the port-a-forts and even the introduction of playground mode (as its inital purpose was not for 1v1s, but to experiment with building as seen in the playground trailers).

The building of forts is not a difficult task requiring a whole lot of skill, whereas build battling is very challenging (to learn) and requires great skill at the game. I think Epic wanted and designed building to be a task requiring almost no skill but still helped you in combat. Even the editing system reflects this, the different structures made from different edits and the whole pre-edit system is all for the building of elaborate forts. The pre-edit system is useless for combat, which is a given since building/editing it appears was not intended for combat. I dont think the devs at epic imagined in their wildest dreams the player base would essentially abuse (in a good way obviously) the editing system for again, close quarter combat. Epic never intended for us to gain the skill to build, make a fast edit, build etc etc

Another aspect that supports this ""theory"" is the original default binds for building. F1, F2, F3 and F4. Such inconveniently placed key binds shows that the building feature wasn't meant to be used for combat.
I'm not sure about you but i have never played a game which requires such fast finger movement. We were never meant to be switching between building, shooting and editing this quickly. This requires skill, and obviously requires countless hours to get proficient at. Epic doesn't want to drive away new players because of this.


**TLDR:** Epic designed building to have no skill gap, yet it became the defining skill gap in the game after the player base turned fort making meta into build battling meta, and as such epic is trying to essentially damage control by adding all these items that nerf building in order to reduce the skill gap. We, the player base, have completely transformed fortnite, and it seems that epic is trying to take back control.


Of course, this opens up a shit ton of new questions which this subreddit has discussed at length, such as:
If what I said is true, why hasn't Epic added a ranked mode?
If build battling is what made the game popular, why is Epic going against their perceived best interests by nerfing it?

Sorry if i repeated myself a bit, i've been awake for 24 hours. Anyway, I'd like to hear you guys' thoughts :)))

So I recently created a video [(here's the link if you're interested)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5DSfKeilfs) for tips/strategies that can potentially help a viewer improve at pop-up cup in Fortnite... in terms of macro/rotations/decisions/evaluating options during a game. In this particular episode, I focus on coming back from a disadvantageous situation in the ENDGAME. I got heavy sniped (and had no heals) but managed to make the best of the situation by proactively looking for opportunities to refresh my HP. Decisions you make can single-handedly decide whether you win a match or not.

**Summary of points in this video:**

* Why Lonely Lodge is a BETTER alternative to Dusty Divot
* Importance of looking around when dropping from Battle Bus
* How to play when you DON'T have a shotgun (only grey burst, etc.)
* How to effectively use the Tac Shotgun (DPS wise)
* How to recognize when you have the advantage in fights
* Role of planes in the current meta 
* 4 STEPS to transitioning from early game/mid game into the top 15.
* When to give up positions in order to conserve HP
* Role of supply drops in the current meta
* How Rifts/Grapplers in the endgame give you EASY rotations (with little to no punishment)
* Following the path of someone else's rotation to give you SAFETY
* Early rotations vs. Late rotations
* Why rotating down a HILL is terrible

In any given scenario in Fortnite, there's always many decisions that one can take, but usually ONE is the most ""correct""/optimal play. I'd like to think that I'm an above average Fortnite player so I want to give back to the community, encourage discussion, and explain the way that I play so people can understand the game better, and ultimately improve. **Feel free to disagree and challenge my ideas too! I'm not perfect, I can be wrong as well.**

That's the whole point of the ""Inside the Mind of Zykoma"" series, where I think out loud, so that viewers can hear my thoughts vocally, and understand the thought processes behind my decisions and the reasons for why I'm playing the way I am, with the hope that they benefit from it.

I just wanted your guys' feedback on how I can improve the series in future episodes so that I can help the viewers the most. This can be anything from criticizing the format of the video, the video length, my voice is too quiet... etc. Anything goes.

Any positive feedback is appreciated too, so that I can continue focusing on that part of the series and work hard to keep it in the series! Also, if the video ended up helping YOU guys improve your Fortnite, let me know!

Appreciate every bit of feedback I get here :) I'll be replying to every single one!

This is the reason building is popular, because no matter where or what you do, every one in the game has access to building. This is different to shooting, as shooting still has a lot of RNG and bloom associated, so of course people are going to rely on building to get close (pushes, offensive building) and finish off with shotguns, one of the least spammy/more accurate guns in the game. This is also the case with defensive turtling, which mostly happens because: A - player 1 has trash guns and doesn't want to die (RNG again) or B - competitive turtling wherein its ""last man standing"" so of course thats going to happen, the only way to stop that is too add more incentives to kills. Overall, If EPIC's goal is too minimize overbuilding, they must reevaluate the entire shooting system as well. ",FortniteCompetitive

Too bad I don’t got a duo partner to play it all the time.

Why can’t they just make it permanent, I wanna hear a reason as to why? Pop up cup is perfect and feels competitive, I don’t understand how a game this popular with tournaments after 1 year has not gotten a competitive mode, r/fortnitecompetitive is begging Epic to add this mode, streamers are begging Epic to add this mode, why is it taking so long? 

Epic literally can add it if they feel like but they are taking too long, I just don’t get why. They could keep pop up cup permanent and make some adjustments when they feel like. 

Tfue and other streamers are willing to play EU pop up cup with high ping because is more enjoyable than normal modes.

I'm working on setting up a scrim league exclusive to xbox. I've been playing fortnite since last December and while I'm not the best, I am at the point where I want to start playing a bit more competitively. I surfed around some of the current scrim leagues and there's really nothing that caught my eye other than the Fortnite Console Wars server, and it was a little too toxic for my liking. I have a bit of experience building and moderating servers and have an artistic eye which helps with laying out everything, so I'm thinking its time for me to start a new project.

I want to build up a server for scrims, and have some unique features. I'm having a bot being built, and am really looking for anyone interested and willing to put in the time to get this going. Thinking of naming it somewhere along the lines of Apex League.

Let me know what you think, and obviously there's a lot I'm not including in the post, as I don't want ideas stolen. I want this to be chill, and smooth sailing.

It's been over a year since this game has been released and there is still a garbage shooting system in place. We've become used to the system but that doesn't mean the system is intelligent or a good design. Recently I was watching a Pro's stream and they spent almost an entire clip to kill a bot that was standing still. Sometimes I lose concentration during a fight because I spend more time screwing around trying to reset my first shot accuracy than focusing on my actual aim.



I honestly feel that fortnite would be an incredibly different experience with true aim, recoil and damage fall off. I've heard the argument that adding true accuracy would result in people getting lasered everytime they peeked or ran from cover. However with the current skill gap in the game I don't think this makes any sense anymore. Due to the huge skill gap of building a lesser skilled player has the same chance of survival against a mechanically skilled player regardless of whether true accuracy is at play. Epic dislikes that building is so dominant but they don't seem to realize that players build because if they take riskier plays they can not rely on hit shots to survive in a battle.


Epic implemented this weird bloom system to give lower skilled players a chance in certain situationsbut what is currently happening is higher skilled players are simply using building to secure victory in those same situations. If Epic wants to see less building battles they should allow players to hit the shots they take. The idea behind this is regardless of how much you build you have to expose your self to what ever opponent you choose to target.



Another thing to consider is this-&gt;

The 3 aspects of a fortnite battle=

1.Shooting
    Is based on an RNG system which lowers skill. Literally the most unbalanced thing in the game. Nobody talks about it but everyone dies do to missing shots they should have hit and lesser skilled players getting lucky headshots.





2.Building 
     Is currently being nerfed continuously. It's currently the only skill based aspect of the game and that's why it's always being nerfed 





3.Anti-Building
     Is being overbuffed and being continuously added. Because it's impossible to accurately shoot people who are building is necessary to destroy building non-stop. There were skill based ways to counter building (traps, grapple plays, impluses) but they've been neglected.

It should be a cycle of:


 shooting-&gt;building-&gt;anti-building-&gt;shooting

I could continue to write an entire essay on this main point is:

TLDR: Epic needs to stop trying to Nerf buildings and add true accuracy to counter excessive building. Building is pointless if you die when you expose yourself.",FortniteCompetitive

Fnatic_Eryc, arguable one of the best players in the game, even has something to say about the counters to builds in this twitter thread: https://twitter.com/ErycTriceps/status/1079764330965544962
Epic is pouring a shit ton of money into the competitive scene but releasing items to cater to the 10 year olds. But I feel at even this point its just to much even my 11 year old cousin hates all these additions. He may not be the best but he still sees how dumb it is. Epic really just needs to re-evaluate their entire thought process on updating this game. Turbo build is still broken, edit delay is still a thing, there is so many bugs plaguing the game right now, its not even funny. #stopaddingstartfixing

The list of reasons goes on and on.

But Epic has released us the Holy Grail of competitive and has literally said - ‘Do it Yourselves’ with the new creative game mode. We are able to create 1v1, 2v2, 4v4 maps, with static spawns, loadouts, and symmetry. No more bullshit items released right before a tournament. Our rules, our maps, our competitive environment. We have seen the talent of creators with deathrun maps, death matches, turtle wars, go karts, yet no one has taken interest in actually developing the only true way to make this builder shooter competitive. 

All it takes is a well designed website, with rankings for teams.
A rule set to be followed in game.

When you say stuff like ""what the fuck, why are epic trying to kill building, the mechanic that made their game popular"" you're implying that epic is a single hivemind entity. Which is what the people responsible for prioritising profit over fanbase satisfaction want. What ""epic"" substitutes in your sentence is the epic games management part of the hierarchy. The ""corporate"" part of it. It's them that trying to keep building at bay, not the hard working people actually developing the game (and doing a great job at it imo). 

Do you think anyone in the working part of the company had any say whatsoever, when for instance, they wanted to put Thanos in it, despite it being a completely artificial (especially stylistically Thanos felt incredibly wtf in Fortnite) crossover? No, management just had a talk with disney (a shareholder of epic btw) who was pushing avengers to kids and then on monday told the people working on the actual game ""hey put thanos in the game, ok? cool"". People were fine with Thanos(myself included), since it was a different game mode and that's ok. But the decision process doesn't change if that's not the case.

Similarly, how do you think the boombox or planes or whatever were added? It boils down to some guy in management who hasn't been actually working on games himself for at least 10 years being fed genuine feedback + information from competent employees on the one hand and on the other hand orders, directions, partnerships and target numbers from his bosses, who are completely removed from the playerbase or the game but are the actual owners of the product and only care about profits. It's always a compromise between these two sides and decisions will always be left to the absolute discretion of the shareholders and management, causing the game to tilt towards their vision over time, which is one of marketing towards casual gamers and especially children. 

This is why their actions feel so dumb and contradictory, because you think of them as a single entity rather than conflicting forces inside a behemoth trying to make money. Your concerns are being heard by the people doing QA, PR etc. and passed on to management, who make the decision that you can go fuck yourself if they can get 10 kids to play it on mobile instead and show the shareholders a +9 statistic.  

This is how the hierarchical corporate structure completely destroys any real quality in f2p games sadly. If you want it to stop, address the actual issues behind it and push for employee control of the product rather than pointlessly circlejerk about evil companies. EA isn't evil, it's typical. So is Tencent (40% share of Epic, 100% share of Riot). ",FortniteCompetitive

When we compare Fortnite tournaments to other games, there is one big difference. The game pros play is completely different from the game casuals play, when you look at CS:GO for example, the pro games are basically the same as casuals but with higher skill level, so you get to see why these people are good.

&amp;#x200B;

The solution in my opinion is not to add weapons that completely ruin the building experience, but instead reduce the material cap on high level games so that we would see real fights from the beginning to the end of the game (maybe 150 for each material).

1. The bots are WAAYYY more bot like but the high tier players are gods. Obviously the average skill level is much higher
2. PC players play much faster overall. I never felt like I couldn't keep up with them in terms of speed but I'm also used to being one of the faster people in console lobbies. The only place I felt much slower is editing 
3. PC players are very accurate close range and can hit shots that aren't reliable at all on console. I will say midrange console has the edge with aim assist but close range (especially when people are jumping and moving) is definitely PC
4. PC players take MUCH more advantage of broken items. This actually surprised me the most.

&amp;#x200B;

The key words in that definition aren't 'as good' or 'better'  The key word is comparable.

&amp;#x200B;

If fortnite wants to truly be competitive then it needs true segregation of skills.  Matchmaking 100% enforcement.  Barring that a handicap system would be acceptable.  

&amp;#x200B;

Every sport out there seperates rookies, intermediates, advanced and pro's.  Sports that allow those skill levels to mingle employ a handicap system.

&amp;#x200B;

Football :  Flag, Tackle, JR High, Highschool, College, NFL

Golf: Youth Leagues, Jr High, Highschool, College, Qualifying Circuit, Pros (Golf allows open play at some tournament levels and overcomes this by having a handicap to make the playing field level when different skill players play each other)

Hockey:  Rec, Travel, High school, College/Minors, NHL

Bowling: youth leagues, teenage leagues, adult leagues, professional.  (also uses a handicap system through most levels)

&amp;#x200B;

So two realistic options that should be do able.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  Seperate players by skill level.  simple enough
2. Institute a handicap system, where lower skilled players get an advantage to bring them up to the higher skilled players level in open matches.  aka give those players extra shields/health.  Nick Mercs spawns into a pub and has a 13 k/d, the highest in that lobby.  Every player with a lower KD rating gets 100 health extra for each whole number difference.  So basically a .5 KD rating player against nick mercs would have 1300 HP when he spawned in.  Which makes sense.  Nick typically kills 13 players to that persons 1.  So then we get into the player with a 5 kd, vs the 1 kd player.  The 5 KD has 900 hp vs the 1KDs 1300.  Still fair, see where I am going with this.

Okay, so its obvious that this item creates a situation where the worse players have an opportunity to kill a better player which you think ""oh Epic wants to cater to the casuals."" Now I do agree, but this is bad for everyone involved. When playing a shooter dying should create a learning opportunity. You should be able to look back and say what could I have done better or how can I improve. Even when killing people you need to think what did I do here that worked well. 

&amp;#x200B;

There is a huge skill gap in this game BUT if you are a new/casual player you die to better players a lot already now add in the frustration of not only dying to better players but also to the anti-fun items ie. sword (thankfully vaulted), plane, boombox, dynamite, turret, and future items epic has surely concocted.   

&amp;#x200B;

What's the solution? It is so simple it blows my mind that this billion dollar empire Epic can't figure it out... Create a matchmaking ladder with competitive rules and items that runs solos/duos AND then you can have regular playlist that you can't continue to let the monkey who designs new updates do his thing for the regular playlist.

Competitive players wont be able to pub stomp so the casuals will have a calmer environment to build their skill.

&amp;#x200B;

The pts would need to be averaged out over all games.  So set up like 5 different tiers

0 pt lobbies

1 pt lobbies

2 pt lobbies

&amp;#x200B;

etc etc.  And only count whole numbers.  

&amp;#x200B;

So tfue plays his first match of the season, gets 9 pts.  he would be in the highest tier lobby ( you could prolly set the highest tier at 5, most players couldnt average 5 pts in popup cups over 100 games).  He would only be against players with that same skill level.  So he gets zero pts his 2nd game, he drops down to the 2 pt lobby, he then gets another 9 pt game.  No he is at 6pts average so the highest tier.  Over time all the players would be segregated into skill levels.

&amp;#x200B;

Reset the pts each season and people who spent a season in a lower tier getting better, would then be able to move up tiers when their pts average reset.

&amp;#x200B;

I truly believe that if they made all the 'competitive' players only be allowed to play with others of their skill level, the competitive players would be complaining that its all too sweaty and not as much fun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Me I personally don't mind epic lowering the skill gap.  Give the new players a chance to have a fun game!  I am all for it, it is healthy for the game as a whole.  Competitive players make up a VERY VERY small percentage of fortnite players.  Epic should 100% cater to them.  

Seperating that small minority through enforced matchmaking would be the best thing they could do.  Prevent top notch players from playing with rookies.

The state of this game is soooooo fucking broken!

""The battle is building.""

Guess that philosophy didn't last long huh? Because if you were to hop into a game in season 7 the only battle I see are flying turrets running INTO your builds, and shooting you down so you die of fall damage, or a turret just completely mowing down your builds, dynamite blowing up literally everything, and oh, let us not forget a fucking BOOMBOX that is basically pulsing dynamite.

Whenever I play now I don't feel like I'm really enjoying myself, more of just playing because I'm bored and all of my friends play fortnite so I play with them. 

Everytime I get into a build fight I feel like building is so useless, I also feel like I've already lost the fight. There are so many counters to building it almost feels like did epic forget how their game started?

Every week, we're getting some new dumbass item that:
1. Counters building.
2. Op item that epic obviously didn't test before adding it. 
3. Counters building.
4. Some new mobility item as if we didn't already have enough.

No new items that make the game more fun, no new bug fixes. No performance fixes.

As of right now, I'm having insane performance issues on pc. This new season has completely obliterated my framrate. But that's a whole nother story.

Epic doesn't address or fix real issues.

We still don't have a fix for performance, almost a month into season 7, but we got a fix for FREE 35 tiers in an HOUR. Do you see it? They fix what makes them lose money but doesn't fix what does affect money.

I am just getting tired of epic doing so many stupid things and doesn't care what we think. Only what makes them more money.

Hell, we're 7 SEASONS into this game and we still don't even have a confirm button when purchasing something?

This obviously shows something, I've been playing since season 4 and this game is so bad I feel like quitting.

In no order: Planes, Dynamite, C4, Turrets, Grapplers, Jetpacks, Infinity Blade (and probably their entire plan of Mythic items before they backtracked and re-evaluated), initial launch of the p90, nerfed mats so it's slower to farm, and now the Boom Box. Building issues that have gone on for many months without fix: Builds sometimes won't place, Edits not working (yes it wasn't just you), getting shot through your own builds that just placed. These issues might be because Epic had no idea building would evolve the way it has, but that's no excuse at this point. The game has earned billions of dollars (3 billion this year) and has been out for almost 1 and a half years.

I love this game. I'm not all doom and gloom. Epic has made amazing progress and improvements with the game such as increased initial hp depending on material type, general QoL changes, map changes, new guns, bug fixes, etc.

But I think most will agree this needs to stop. It's ruining the competitive integrity of this game. It's ruining what made this game so great in the first place. I'm so sick of Epic not learning their lesson each time they add stupid shit every week.

TL;DR Epic needs to stop adding things that are anti building in their building game, fix game breaking issues, and re-evaluate their entire process on updating FortniteBR.",FortniteCompetitive

SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP

The BoomBox is awesome. Finally 4kd players can much quicker kill the 2kd playground warriors that would normally just go hide in their invincible box.

Even if the BoomBox is overpowered, give it a day or two before you decide, don’t just watch a Twitch clip and come on here and whine. Figure out what counters it (hint: you have a gun, shoot the person) before you give your final verdict. Literally all this subreddit now is complaining and bitching and moaning! God, if I see one more post from a user with &lt;2kd about how this is made to help the casuals... It’s time to accept that building is no longer the skill gap. With turbo building and infinite materials &amp; no fall damage in PG/Creative, the amount of building sweats that can’t do anything but, rises every day. Building has become too strong.

Bottom line: stop complaining every fucking time a new change happens. I’ve never made a post like this before, not even when they nerfed and removed my beloved Fortnitemares because of all the babies on here complaining, but seriously mods this has got to stop. Peace out ",FortniteCompetitive

Here me out...","We should really just push Epic constantly about fulltime competitive mode instead of making the main game more competitive. I just commented about this but felt like I need to post. Many people here are parroting that Epic is not listening to the community with add-ons like the boombox, but that thing is hilarious for really young kids, and there are much more of them than there are slightly older people. Also, kids actually spend more money than slightly older players, as the kids are using their parent's money. We do not want to lose those kids and other casuals, as them playing made the game into the mainstream and they will grow to competitive supporters making the games lifetime longer. All you here know what Epic added during the last few months and the boombox fits totally into that history. This should not be surprising to you. They are going for a crazy and fun experience with the normal battle royale mode, and what we need is just a more mature competitive version. Your imagination about competitive Fortnite is just too far from their idea for the basic experience, so we should really just keep pushing for the competitive and not be frustrated about the main game.

489,Throwing_Foreskins,1546163627,aaup9y,23,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aaup9y/i_made_this_comment_on_the_stickied_post_on_the/,1,I made this comment on the stickied post on the other subreddit and I was just curious what other people thought of what my friend and I came up with,"What items should return from the vault? In my opinion more items should be removed rather than added back. Not only because the huge amount of weapons that we have in the game now seem to reduce game performance (more and more people have started complaining about this, and I personally experience it too, it's ridiculous) but also because we have weapons that I personally feel are unbalanced. I talked to a friend about this and he agrees that all these weapons should be vaulted or adjusted.

-Quad launcher should be vaulted. It's basically a quadruple RPG that does 40 less damage per shot and they're way to quiet. The amount of times I got quad launched without hearing anything is absolutely absurd.

-I don't think this game needs the Heavy Sniper. I agree it's really fun and the long reload times make it more balanced and all, but this is about what we need. Do we need a sniper that does 150+ damage? In my and my friend's opinion we don't.

-The Deagle needs to be adjusted. No doubt. The one-shotting wood is really fun but it's so dumb that it can one-shot a structure that has finished building. I feel that damage to players is fairly balanced, but the structure damage is actually dumb.

-My friend and I feel that all the burst rifles other than the Famas should be vaulted. They're guns that people only use when they can't find anything else. I see many people take a grey AR over a golden Famas. We don't need the bursts, and it would also decrease early game RNG, because let's face it, getting a burst at the starts usually ends in a death for me.

-PLANES. Don't even get me started. Remove the ramming feature, remove the turret. I've launched too many players off mountains and build fights, it's actually dumb. I've shot down countless of fights with 2 seconds of my turret fire. It's dumb. It should only be for rotations and your squad should be able to defend it from shooting from their spots, but in no way should the planes have a gun themselves.

-Turrets were used a lot when they just came out, now no one uses them. Everyone I squad with drops them as soon as they get them in their inventory. Basically the same as Freeze Traps.

-Six Shooter can be vaulted. Was fun, not fun any more.

-Suppressed Pistol can go to. Same as the six shooter, was fun and not any more. I have seen absolutely no one use them in the past months.

-Now this is something that I'm not really sure about, but Grapplers. Do we need grapplers? I don't think so... We have planes, quad crashers for early game rotations and Rift-To-Go's for late game rotations. And people can just grapple up to high ground because that is very skill based.

Most of these changes are to do with the fact that we have so much items in the game and I feel that it is seriously degrading performance. Over the last seasons we have seen serious performance issues, which came with all of the new items that have been added over that period of time. Are these items the only reason for performance issues? Probably not. They are most certainly a part of it though. Let me know if there is anything you disagree with because I could definitely see people wanting to throw in their own part of this.

This being said, items that I wouldn't mind returning would be the Bouncers, and we could maybe use some more SMG variety.",FortniteCompetitive

It’s almost impossible to hit someone flying straight at you shooting, and then they boost through your fight with 0 consequences.

This, 100%, **should not be in the game**. Usually with epics shitty items and updates I can find *some* reasoning. But planes and the sword have/had 0 reason for being in the game other than letting shit players get free kills on better ones they’d never otherwise get. 

It’s bullshit that I, or any other player, can easily win a game just landing in a plane and ramming competent players in fights.",FortniteCompetitive

495,Jilted11,1546155566,aatzsf,17,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aatzsf/casuls_wont_like_it/,1,cAsULs WoNT lIkE iT,"This sub, generally, has an odd stance on 50 hp in the normal game. Every other comment is ""the casuals won't like it.""

First off, Epic has tested things in the vanilla modes that have were negatively accepted or split. Zombies, Sword, Redeploy, P90 (pre-nerf), etc. I also see mixed feedback when it comes to planes front the main FN sub as well as my in real life casual friends. (Most of my casual friends have actually quit the game; some specifically because of ""annoying"" planes.) 

This sub needs to stop speaking for casuals on everything. While the game is catered to casuals and they should be kept in mknd, health on kills, at the least, deserves to be tested for a few days in vanilla modes. Epic can gather feedback from the casuals directly. If they absolutely hate it, I would honestly accept it being removed. The key word here is *tested*. The other things mentioned above were tested, and the community spoke. Epic acted accordingly. 

Also, do not say the pop up cups are a true test for HP on kills. The pop up cup is not played by the average joe. Also, I imagine 99% of pop up cup players like the settings anyways. 

HP on kills is not bad for the casual player. Not one casual on earth enjoys playing a full game to find no shields. Ask any casual player, or ask any competitive player. The casual friends I have all want the harvest rate and HP on kills in the main game. Casuals, when getting a kill, benefit by getting health just like everyone else. If a casual wins a fight, it gives them a better shot against a third party.

""Casuals will have to fight good players that have shields all the time."" People are acting like this never happens now. Shields are RNG. The better player may have shields, and the casual does not. Vice versa. Casuals run into better players with more shields all the time. It's part of the game, and guess what, maybe that casual would have more of a shot if the one or two kills they got in the match gave them HP.

Epic needs to at least test HP on kills in the normal gamemodes. Then, if casuals truly hate it like everyone claims, (although I have yet to run into a casual online or from friends that dislikes it), I will gladly accept it as a pop up cup thing only. Epic has tested much BS in the past, and I guarantee, if tested, casuals would enjoy the HP on kills much more than this sub gives them credit for.",FortniteCompetitive

He want €80 for it

~  2 month
~ no damage
~ no scratches on the screen
X only some visible marks with his dirty fingers.

The problem is that my fortnite runs minimum 160 and maximum 240 , so i don't take the full advantage out of it
will this be a big problem or no?

Im using freesync supported monitor + AMD GPU

Note, currently using 1080i TV panel on 1079x1080 30hz
so the jump to a higher hertz will be a big yikes


Comment your thoughts :)

I will thank you in advance

**Things to clear up:**

I used gimp to create this and this is my first time using gimp. This took at least an hour and I only had to search how to scale layers.

I did not have enough room to add Contrails or Emotes but they will work the same way.

You will be able to create unlimited amounts of Custom Outfits.

You will be able to name each of your Custom Outfits e.g. Brite Commando.

**How this works:**

Each Custom Outfit can choose between any of your items including, Contrail and Emotes. You can either select an item, choose to randomise your items or randomise your favourite items, which are separate per Custom Outfit. You can also favourite the complete Custom Outfit.

Once your Custom Outfits are complete you can either select which on you want to use, randomise all of the Custom Outfits or randomise your favourited Custom Outfits.

**Pros and Cons:**

**Pros** **-** This will allow players to use all of their purchases, as they will always be able to match (your preference).

This would make some players more willing to spend money on skins if they know they are able to use all of them without having to change their selected outfit each time so that it matches.

**Cons** **-** Is there any?",FortNiteBR

I have been playing PC games most my life so I'm good with a keyboard and mouse however I am no stranger to a controller from the CoD days. You might suggest I play Keyboard and Mouse on PS4 however I have tried this and since I use mouse buttons to build the PS4 does not support them and they don't work, Also I heard Keyboard and mouse on PS4 is going to be removed soon and it will basically be like playing on PC. 

PC players especially in the EU region are very difficult to win against consistently and I have been debating whether to move to console as the players are more casual (like me). I have friends that play xbox (who I would cross platform which normally) and I have won squads with them whistle playing on console gathering a few kills.

I don't know anyone who plays PS4 I only got it to play the PS exclusive games on however all I have played recently on there is Fortnite. I am really stuck as to what to play on as I want to be able to play and win with ease without having to sweat every single fight building and running out of mats going for the highground.

If anyone could give me advice on what to do - I know its personal preference but I'm genuinely bored and don't know what to do. Thanks",FortNiteBR

Fortnite has a gamer base of around the 100 million if i'm correct and the skillset goes from ""i started today and have no idea what this weapon does"" to ""22 kills? not even my best"". this demonstrates that the game has a high skill ceilling and is interesting to improve in and again! this is great! the problem is that 2 players from either side meet in the same lobbies to compete for the same objective : the victory royale. And, apart from rare occasions, we know the outcome will always be the same. the player with 17 kpm this season will win and destroy the young gazelle.

&amp;#x200B;

ok so we have a problem of noob getting destroyed, but that's normal isn't it? -Yes it is. But!

&amp;#x200B;

 But now we have the intermediate players. those who picked the game 2 months ago, 4 months ago and are trying to improve in an unfair environment composed of either noobs, same-ish level players, and ultimate masters, all at once. for those the fights are tricky ; they never know what to expect since the skin don't often tell us anything about the player we are facing. they win easily against the noobs and they get destroyed by the pro, and rarely they have an even fight in which they improve because they understand what lacked in their playstyle when they lost, or what worked well and helped them win.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if we considerate the random aspect of any battle royale and especially fortnite (im looking at you, bloom), pretty much everyone can agree on the fact that dying unfairly isn't really interesting.

&amp;#x200B;

What i'm getting at is that we have enough to players to divide the player base into skill categories, which could work with a hidden (or not) elo system deciding with which players one get matched. the noobs with the noobs, low intermediate with low intermediate, high intermediate with high intermediate, and above with above. 

This would guarantee that you get matched with people of your level and thus can give the best of your skill, help everyone improve, and give a whole new meaning to getting 30 kills in a single game. 

Also one can imagine a way to unlock lobbies such as : say you are a ""silver player"", you win a game and become a ""gold"" player-&gt; your elo gets big enough -&gt; you access a new lobby, the ""gold"" but you can chose to be matched in a higher elo lobby, the ""diamond"" lobby (not the other way around) and try your luck or skill for bigger elo wins.

&amp;#x200B;

so yeah, this is my suggestion, a pretty long text but i had to post it somewhere since i never saw anyone bring the idea of placement matchmaking imported into fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

tl/dr : players have different skills, going from absolute gumbo to God of K/D is unfair for everyone, having an elo system could help match players with eachothers based on skill would be a good idea to help everyone improve

&amp;#x200B;

note : this would apply to solo and would need tweaks in duos and squads

note 2 : of course now we have a problem of smurfing but it's still better than random placement

I haven't seen anybody mention this or bring it to Epic's attention, but they have patched some really unnecessary things when it comes to emotes in the past few weeks. Not sure if intentional or on purpose, so if you have any info, let me know!

Anyway, some changes I'm referring to:

1. With this patch (5.30) you are no longer able to jump to cancel an emote, more specifically with flipping sexy. There was a little trick I loved to do with flipping sexy where I would jump right before I hit the ground and it would cause you to do a neat little backflip.

2. This one was stated in the patch notes a few updates ago, but you are no longer able to crouch while emoting. What was this hurting? There's literally no reason for this to be patched, especially since it seemed as though it was a feature (stickers, the wave emote, etc all worked seamlessly)

3. Similar to the above, which I assume is an affect of patching crouching and emoting, crouching and uncrouching quickly to cancel out emoting no longer works. This was my preferred method of canceling out emotes rather than walking away or switching weapons.

4. This is a big one for me; a few weeks ago, in the patch notes, they stated that they unpatched the ability to do an emote for .1 seconds after you jump. For example, if you had slow clap, you could jump up, hit slow clap, and do one clap in mid air. It made for some funny moments, such as with the L dance. Then, a patch or 2 later, it was patched once again.

Some people might think this is a pointless thing to be making a post about, but I feel like not many people have brought this to Epic's attention, nor have they stated anything on some of these changes. 

I play this game with my friends and just like to have fun and not take it too seriously, and little things like this make it so much more fun, so when they are taken away for no reason at all, it's a little discouraging. Let me know what you guys think of this!",FortNiteBR

I play on PC, and I feel like I’m a pretty solid builder and I have above average aim especially with a sniper, but my game awareness isn’t very good and that’s definitely something that I need to work on. Anyway, the problem is I’m just not very good at this game. I have 4 solo wins in around 1000 solo games with a barely positive KD. I frequently die to 3rd parties, especially early game because I struggle to finish fights quickly and stay aware of people around me, but I don’t know how to get better in that department. It’s not uncommon for me to make it to the top 10 with 4-7 kills only to either be picked off as soon as I finish fighting someone else, or to get completely shit on by a much better player without putting up much of a fight. I try to stay positive and learn from my mistakes but recently I’ve found myself blaming the game/meta because I don’t feel like I’m getting any better. All my friends play console and are really good at the game (15-50% solo win percentages) and we can win cross-platform duos or squads without too much of a problem but they’re all better than me and I definitely feel like I’m getting carried because I struggle to win by myself.

I have an idea. Fortnite is one of the top games in the world right now, people love it and love all its ideas. So, I was thinking, if I put my idea they Could love it and they could put it in the game. First thing, you know that pencil and blueprint that pop out when you put buildmode, why not change that, why not puting a LANTERN or even puting the gaunlet of Thanos, for example, using the lantern to bulid(stairs or walls) and puting traps, same as the gaunlet.

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, I am pretty indifferent to the word in our society because at this time it seems we are working on not using it, but it won't happen overnight so yeah. There is that first. Don't think you should say it, but I am not going to hate you if you do (unless you say it like every sentence because come on man).

&amp;#x200B;

However, I feel like someone like Daequan should not be able to say it on Twitch. Twitch has community guidelines which are clearly broken when he says these kind of words on stream. If, per say, Tfue (which seems to be an easy target for Twitch Moderation Team Members due to his toxicity and that of his stream) was to say this, he would most likely get rebanned. There are actually examples of other streamers getting punished for saying this word on stream. Look at Pewdiepie. Said it on stream in a sentence and was instantly in trouble. Ninja has said it repeatedly and had problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Not trying to make this a race thing because it should not come to that. However, i feel that no streamers should be allowed to say this. Hope everyone can try and keep this civil. Probably not, but who knows.",FortNiteBR

I read somewhere that every 4 hours a cacti is destroyed. There were 190 cacti, according to the post. 

190 Cacti x 4 hours = 760 Hours. 760 hours =31 days. 

Fortnite Season 5 is supposed to end September 25th, which is coincidentally 31 days from now. What if that is the day Paradise Palms gets destroyed or taken out of the game? It would make sense, as the final cacti would be destroyed on the last day of Season 5, or the first day of Season 6.

Honestly it's a disgrace, the game was underperforming but playable when it first released and it has just gotten worse and worse with every update.

Stefan Karl Stefansson played the role of Robbie Rotten on the children's television show LazyTown. Most of you already know this, but to the few who don't, Stefan's character in addition to LazyTown in general was a large part of the childhoods of many people growing up in the 2000s. A very considerable portion of Fortnite Battle Royale's playerbase (and possibly some people at Epic Games) is of that demographic, so I feel I speak for my demographic when I say that there needs to be a Robbie Rotten skin available in Fortnite Battle Royale.

Stefan Karl Stefansson has already been immortalized in television and partially in gaming with For Honor (he did the Icelandic lines for the Vikings), so let's fully immortalize him with a skin in the most popular game in the world right now.

The context of this discussion relies of the psychological theory of behaviourism, of which the operant conditioning framework I'll allude too throughout. If you've ever heard of terms like 'reinforcement' or 'punishment' in terms of behaviour, operant conditioning is all about that. There are many other theories I could talk about but this one will be my focus. 

I'll present this discussion in 'extremes' for illustration purposes, as well all fall somewhere in between this. 

So we'll start with two players who have never played, going into 1000games. 

One is tasked towards playing for the win passively, (avoiding risk and hiding, only engaging at the very late game) the other also playing for the win but engaging at any opportunity he is presented with. 

Edward Thorndikes ['law of effect'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_effect) states that any behavior followed by positive consequences is likely to be repeated, and any behavior followed by negative consequences is likely to not be repeated.

What does this mean? Basically, if a certain behaviour (in this case your approach to game) has a positive outcome you're likely to do it again but if it has a negative outcome, you are less likely to do it again, you’ll use this less or not at all. So, even though two players might try the same tactic on each other, the outcome for them determines the continuation or not. 

So in their first dozen or so games our passive player can easily get late game (hide in bush/house etc) and go into the1v1 and he'll occasionally get a Royale. With our aggressive player, he finds another player, engages, and dies early.

The trouble starts at this point is that our behaviour is more so mediated/influenced by immediate consequences compared to long term consequences. So, the passive players playstyle behaviour is reinforced with every encounter he avoids (stays alive) and ongoing as the more players drop off (closer he gets to final two). That passive play is reinforced and continues throughout that game and into the next game. 

Back to our aggressive player. His deaths come with any number of learning outcomes (this gun not good at that distance/build ‘X’ in ‘Y’ situation) for the most part the idea the aggressive player gets is 'stop doing what lead to death, do something else &amp; that lead to success, do it more’

So his learning is now being what we call ['shaped'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaping_(psychology)) at a faster rate than the passive player.

Now, take this throughout more and more games, the aggressive player may not have won a royale yet but has many more learning experiences. Essentially, he's learning a lot faster about the behaviours that lead to success and the behaviours that lead to death, or in other words when you lose your getting better at not losing again, and when you win you refine how you won that battle even further. 

The aggressive players behaviour is punished in the short term yes, but shaped by the outcome of his behaviour towards increased skill in the long term. These skills are more likely to lead to a higher ratio of successful engagements/ratio of wins. Compared to our passive player though, he may have some royales yes but a smaller skillset.

The passive player is also 'stuck' in what we call a ['variable ratio schedule of reinforcement'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Effects_of_different_types_of_simple_schedules). This implies he may stick to his passive play even though the success of that playstyle becomes less and less successful over time, so he'll still be sticking to it even though his last passive play win was 70 games ago. These schedules are the same schedules gambling slot machines are under and in studies, animals have 'gambled' themselves to death as they continually persist with a behaviour in the hopes of a payoff. 

This schedule is also highly resistant to behaviour change. For example let's say he goes to an aggressive style but is amongst the first to die. With our 'law of effect' in play and with his extensive learning history of getting further/winning with the passive play, but now playing aggressive and dying early, he's less likely to go aggressive again and revert back to passive, give or take. (Tried that didn't work, do what does work).

So over 1000 games we've had one player not engage until the last moment and only had 1000 encounters (for sake of argument) and a win perhaps some random amount of times, yes he would of learnt some skils through his errors. 

However, contrast this to the engaging player. Alot of his initial games he'll have low kills and no royales but as he continues to engage he learns more skills quicker. Even if other those 1000 games his kill count averages out at 4 per game, he's had 4000 encounters (3000 more than the passive player) all equating to more refined and effective (through shaping) gameplay behaviour across all domains of skills (different weapons, building, use of map, circle etc).

So, you can see where the skill gap would be increasing more and more between the two players at 50 games, 100, 250, 700 etc, and beyond the 1000 games. The aggressive player loses less and wins more often sooner, compared to the passive players slower learning and sporadic royales.

Where battle Royale/fortnite comes in is the game objective and gameplay mechanic variables. 

In contrast to other games, you won by engaging and getting most kills because that was the objective. The same above principles of the aggressive player apply to everyone, you have to play. 

However the objective of battle Royale doesn't necessitate high kills at all. You can win (and people have, I know I certainly have) by not killing anyone and the other final player making a mistake to eliminate themselves, or just camping out for the kill opportunity. 

So, the passive player playstyle is legitimately 'winning' in the current game he is in by getting to the final two, and therefore reinforced and maintained. The aggressive player is 'losing' if dying at 37th even with 5 kills. 

Relative to variability. If you dont engage you're more likely to have underpowered weapons, were as the player who engages more often picks up the best gear from players. So this is where you get to the final 1v1 against the guy with 8 kills, great weapon and health loadout, max resources, 10 traps, 5 cozyfires, 3 jumppads, etc.

Taking the passive players style even further, he is also likely to obtain a minimal amount of gear. They likely get to whatever safe chests they can and go back to their reserved (avoidant and hiding) gameplay. The chances of obtaining a powerful weapon are left absolutely to random. 

On a small side note, because of the randomness of collecting gear, the aggressive player has more chances of winning with a play involving a build and the weaker weapons pistol against the passive players scar. They learnt how to use what they've got even if it's not the greatest gear. 

So, let's say our passive and aggressive player met at the end of their 1001st game. Our aggressive player simply pulls out his bag of skills with his powerful weapons and outplays and overpowers his opponent. And even if he gets hit, has the resources to get back on his feet. The passive player doesn't have the skills and gears to match.

Yes, there are times when not engaging is best for the aggressive player, but even this behaviour world stem from a background of learning trial and error. Eg: don't run into another 1v1 battle, run in at end or in enough time before player heals up / you're at a massive disadvantage somehow with the map, try a different approach somehow. 

This 'learning' by shaping through consequences is largely seen as sub or unconscious learning. (This theory doesn't incorporate 'thoughts and emotion' so to speak). But of course we also incorporate learning from others, eg: we hear or see a streamer tell us a strategy, try it ourselves and if it results in success we continue, if it doesn't we'll likely not use it. Same principle really, and this is just a verbal statement stemming from their own background of trial and error This alludes to another part of the theory (long story)

The end of this, largely in relation to playstyle, is to vary your gaming behaviour. This applies for both the aggressive and passive player, as their behaviour will continually be shaped. Try a strategy a decent amount of times before you decide it won't work for you, the first bunch of results aren't the best measure of whether it works well or not. 

Thoughts? What else would you like to hear about to do with psychology and fortnite? There is a theory out there that explains the diminishing ‘rush’ when you get more and more royales. ",FortNiteBR

I mean, if epic really wanted to get fancy with the toilet paper contrail, they could have made the toilet paper roll coming off your character initially thick as you jump from the bus and become thinner and thinner as you get closer to the ground, eventually losing all paper and leaving nothing behind on your character but the brown cylinder, showing you ran out of toilet paper and indicating you are about to begin gliding (a way to gauge how close you are to deploying your glider),  

Instead, the toilet contrail is nothing but white, ugly lines that disgustingly obstruct my view as I glide down towards the map.

So far these two strikes ended up resulting in each destroying 1 cactus, there originally were 8 cacti. With this information we had enough information to conclude that the rift lighting strikes will theoretically occur at these times below. We theorize that these cacti resemble a clock and when the last one is struck, something will happen, most likely the rift closing.

Months afterwards, I noticed that all of my friends were playing Fortnite and I felt left out of the fun because the only console I own is a Switch. When it finally came out for the Switch, I was so excited. All throughout Season 4 the game was great. I was hyped for season 5, but when it dropped, I noticed that the game was way worse in terms of performance. Since season 5 came out, I have put about 125 hours into the game and have spent about 130 dollars because I was banking on the fact that Epic would fix the major performance issues that Switch users were dealing with. Some of them include major frame drops after picking up the first weapon in a game (usually 1 - 5 seconds), major frame drops during build fights (sometimes less than 10 FPS), textures not loading in, items not loading in, major lag spikes, and extremly low resolution. After all, Fortnite is the biggest game on the planet, and Epic seemed to be doing a good job during Season 4, so I had faith that they would fix the issues that started after Season 5. Yet Here we are over a month after Season 5 released and the game is the worst state that it has ever been in on Switch. I am tired of opening Fortnite after the a big patch every two weeks, getting excited because Epic says that they have improved performance on Switch, only to see that it has barely changed. Sure, the 5.2 patch made it slightly better, but after the lastest patch (5.3), performance has been worse than ever before, even though the patch notes claim otherwise. People will tell me to buy a ""superior console,"" but they have to understand that I'm not going to buy another console just to play one game that should run fine on the system that I already own. I no longer think Epic cares about Switch players, as they have not acknowledged any performence issues on Switch (tell me if I'm wrong), and actually made them worse with the latest patch. For now I am done putting up with Epic's crap, as I can play other games that will actually work as intended. Maybe I'll play a game or two after the next patch to see if performance has improved, but I doubt it will. I love this game and I really don't want to quit, but I can't play it in the current state that it's at, and I can't support developers who won't even acknowledge some of it's biggest issues.

Because it makes aiming extremely inconsistent and goes from too slow to too fast. If you add an abormally high deadzone to that your aim is always going to be too fast or too slow. 

Fortnite not only now put acceleration on everyone on PS4 it also still doesnt have a deadzone slider so pretty much everyone has extreme issues with aiming and half my friends wont play until its fixed. 

Bottom line is. Acceleration should never be on and we NEED a deadzone slider so we can actually make our settings the way we want them to be. 

Im sick of you changing the aim sensitivity without giving us any option to revert it or actually give us the option to fine tune with the new settings. ",FortNiteBR

Doesn’t this tell you that they want it to be like this? Hmm... their approach is very wrong on the game in terms of keeping players happy. They try to make the game too “noob friendly” but every single game you play there are always going to be the superior players no matter how much you tweak the game. But this is where it gets bad because your big streamers primarily play this game for the core of it which is the building mechanics. If the core fun of the game persists to let down people and especially these big streamers. The game will inevitably die. There will be competition who will fill in the gaps and the streamers will find a new hype and where the streamers go... the fans will follow.

We’re aware that MAC players on Nvidia hardware are running into textures not properly loading and we’re in testing to determine the exact cause of this bug.

A current work around for this would be:

* Update OS to the latest version (10.13.6, High Sierra).
* Update GPU drivers via the NVIDIA web installer (here).
* Play on 'Low' settings.

&amp;nbsp;

We’ll keep you updated on the progress of this issue.

Let me tell you all a story.,"Back in the Civil Times, after the meteor struck, us and them got along fine. Our Kingdoms were friendly, in a competitive sense. We would feast together, burgers and pizza, in harmony. 

Then, the Dark Times washed upon us. We lost our God to the Rifts. We mourned. They cheered. They thought their god was the one true God. We began to loath those rotten tomatoes as they ate their disks of dough while we wept. The day came when their god was ripped from them, we cheered and feasted upon our juicy burgers and greasy fries as they shed tears enough to fill Loot Lake many times over. 

Some time passed, both Kingdoms grew to loath the other. The dough flingers kept to their side and we kept to ours. The one common hatred between us was the Rift. A couple months ago, the Rift giveth what the Rift taketh away. It returned our God. 

We rejoiced upon hearing the news our Lord of Greasy has returned to us! We trekked day and night, north bound we went. His shiny metallic bun shimmered in the distance. Droves of us, running, riding, gliding to our Lord and Savior. As I approached my God, I saw the Rift had defiled my good Lord. I wept. We wept. We all wept. 

The Tomatoheads laughed at our grief. I remember the hatred becoming deep fried inside me as they bellowed in our faces. I remember the anger. I remember wanting to squash them all into ketchup and drenching my burger and fries in their blood. Alas, war would be the last thing our God wanted. So, I heeled the rage deep inside. 

A few days ago, a statue of their god was dropped upon the throne of their beloved. We laughed as their god was much more inferior now. Ours was defiled, but theirs? Their god was so small and frozen in stone. Aha, oh did we laugh hard. But now...

Now. Their god not only returned, but he has returned a KING?!? Our God gets defiled and theirs comes back a fucking KING??!! Not only did their god return a King, but they have the audacity to convert one of our own against his will?! I think not!!!


I have talked to the elders. They have returned from the one true God, Durrrburger. On their command, we will strike those rotten Tomatoheads. We will strike hard. We will spray the lands of Fortnite with their blood for all to enjoy with their fries. We will strike and we will destroy their King god thing. We will overtake Tomato Town, Tomato Tombs, Tomato whatever the fuck and we will succeed. 

See you on the battle field Tomatoheads. Just know, Fried Green Tomatoes are my favorite snack. ",FortNiteBR

Greetings to all who have come,

&amp;#x200B;

Approximately 8 months ago, I pronounced myself the mayor of Tomato Town. My town was prosperous and we had alliances in place with people such as the Ogre of Moisty Mire and the Sons of Anarchy Acres. The world was inhabited by only 5 types of human and building was a mechanism that was rarely used. Even though much has changed on our beautiful island, I will only be discussing my fair land and the devastation that has arose.

&amp;#x200B;

I would first like to speak on behalf of the disappearance of my statue on top of our town's favorite, and idolized, Tomato Pizza Shop. When the rift began to create a rip in time and space, my people panicked and thought that Tilted Towers may be a safer place to raise their families. Rest assured, this scuttle was appeased with a late night movie at Risky Reels, the only place that my citizens have ever gone for leisure. Later on, we were relieved to see a rift, once again, where my statue had been for decades. However, when the shriveled version of my statue had come through, the residents of Tomato Town were brought into confusion and fear. At this point, there was little that I could do. As temple ruins began to rise from the ground, they lost hope for a peaceful life in my beloved town. All of the citizens packed their bags for Snobby Shores or Tilted Towers. Except for one.

&amp;#x200B;

The rules are simple:

1. Step in my temple, don't leave alive
2. Steal from the mayor and the mayor steals your life
3. Take my chest, I take yours
4. You will **die** if you land in my land

Please comment if there are any grievances, but beware. I am back.

\-Your Mayor",FortNiteBR

That is not to say I am against these changes, as it's quite the opposite. I think these changes should be implemented, as long as the user is given the choice on whether or not to enable them. If there is one thing this game is lacking, it's options for players to finetune their controls and overall experience. Even on pc, sensitivity selection is vague and its even worse on console, with the recent expermentation. Many games, even on console, provide ample opportunity to adjust the experience to something that suits you. Take Rocket League for example. Even the console version of that game has a deadzone slider. It's insane that Fortnite is creating accesibility options like the on screen notifications of where you are being shot from, before even making sure the average players experience doesn't change on a whim. We as a community need more choice in how we play this game.",FortNiteBR

I do think people are underestimating how many fuck ups play with m&amp;kb on ps4. I admit my sample group is not the biggest but out of 8 people that I know who play fortnite on ps4 , two people already abuse this mechanic. 

I read somewhere that Epic finally wants to put these players in their own lobby. Probably cuz they analyzed some data... Please hurry up. It is really about time!!!!

With a xim adapter people can still abuse m&amp;kb but at least I heard they cannot keybind with that.

I understand that snipers are supposed to perform this way, but is it too much to ask for a subtle queue that maybe you don’t wanna peek? Honestly just some scope glint would be great as it’s not too obvious, but the more attentive player will know not to peek or they’ll get melted by a sniper. The reason this bothers me so much is because every other gun has some sort of subtle indicator when it is being prepared that allows someone else to prepare for said weapon in a fight. Given that snipers bank on a one shot kill, and thus any audible gunshot queues would be negligible once the weapon is fired, is it possible that this could be considered?",FortNiteBR

So I as most of you are not willing to spend 1000$ on a phone for a skin. 

I thought about just going to the store first and trying to get it by logging in etc(you heard this stuff like a million times).

I found out that there's this thing called ""Retail mode"" and the phone is bassicaly an ""LDU"" unit(LDU = Live Demo Unit) which means it has limited functions one of them including installing apk's i believe. Which means you won't be able to install Fortnite.

Also IF the phone isn't in retail mode it might be a demo mode which can be easily disabled(google it). After that you might succeed and even then there's only one use per device.

For season 6, we definitely need a change up of challenges and I believe we as a community can offer some good ideas. Feel free to leave your ideas below and hopefully we can get this seen by some of the Epic Devs...

A few of my ideas (Remember, Challenges shouldn’t be easy): 

- Get a kill while riding an ATK
- Drive 2000m on an ATK in One Match
- Ride a Shopping Cart 2000m 
- Kill someone by making them fall (Hard)
- Place 5 traps in 1 match
- Revive 10 teammates
- Spray Paint on 5 different houses
- Get a Kill with 3 different weapons in 1 match
- Get a Kill with 2 different explosives in 1 match
- Search 7 Chests on the back of Cars
- Build a structure that is 200m tall in One Match
- Shoot 10 toilets at Flush Factory
- Get 5 kills while Crouching
- Get 3 kills while crouching in 1 game
- Get 3 kills while jumping
- Kill an enemy while being 150m up
- Jump off of 5 diving boards
- Jump off the top of 3 different ATKs
- Gather 2500 Metal
- Gather 3000 Brick
- Gather 4000 Wood

Perhaps we can even add in seasonal challenges that reward skill rather than money. People can get special rewards for completing these challenges.(Numbers can be Adjusted)

- Get 10 Wins in Season 6
- Get 25 Wins in Season 6
- Get 50 Wins in Season 6
- Get 100 Wins in Season 6
- Get 250 Wins in Season 6
- Get 100 Kills in Season 6
- Get 1000 Kills in Season 6
- Get 2500 Kills in Season 6 
- Gather 10000 materials in Season 6
- Gather 25000 materials in Season 6
- Gather 50000 materials in Season 6

Obviously there would be special rewards for each of these and they can’t be bought and would let better players stand out more than others and rewards grind rather than just buying tiers in the bp. 

I’d like to hear your ideas for challenges as well as your thoughts on this... ",FortNiteBR

Everything is so sluggish and slowmo like.

The main reasons are probably
1. You can't stop sprint animation anymore (all platforms)
2. Sensitivity changes (Console only)
3. You can't cancel any animation anymore (all platforms)
4. game feel like it's not running constant 60fps on Xbox anymore, not even on the X. (Xbox One)
5. Overall huge ping and sping spikes (probably all platforms, EU servers)

As much as i love the game, this is going beyond ridicilous. Less than 60fps is a joke. Also not being able to cancel animations / sprint animation is terrible, movement feels so slow. I had 35 ping when i started back in season 3, but now it can be as high as 80 wich for me as competitive player is way too high. In other games my ping is around 40. Different sensitivity is something i can get used to, but it's still not fun to start building my muscle memory again.

Since then its been a constant shit show of game ruining bugs. So far it seems that Epic hasn’t addressed these issues going on the switch directly (I may be wrong, please correct me if I am) even though I’ve seen tons of post relating to these issues. At first I thought it may be my WiFi connection or something to do with my device, but when I started checking reddit I realised what the real cause was.... 

The main issues I’ve been facing personally are:
- Massive lag spikes
- Frame drops
- When I go to pick up the first item there is a freeze for a few seconds 
- In crowded areas buildings look like blobs when you first arrive

Other than this the switch already lacks stats and replays but I think that’s understandable due to limitations of such a device. HOWEVER the issues mentioned above are really fucking up a great game for a good portion of users. 

Please fix this. It’s been a while now. ",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;

We mentioned in the v5.30 Patch Notes we’d made adjustments to gamepad options by tuning controller inputs and accelerations to allow for more fine tuning when aiming. Based on player feedback we went a bit too far here. We’re going to revert this change to how it functioned prior to the update. As of now, we’ve reverted what we can via hotfixes but will need to release a client update to solve for the rest. We’ll get this out to you as soon as we’re able to but don’t currently have a time frame.

&amp;nbsp;

We also lowered the dead-zone used for aiming on Xbox One controllers, which we are leaving implemented in-game as we believe this is a healthy adjustment in the long term. In doing this we discovered and fixed a bug that slightly changed Aim Sensitivity for controllers. This means you may need to adjust your sensitivity to get that “just right” feeling back, but you’ll no longer experience the change in aim acceleration.

We thank all of you for the feedback around this, please continue to let us know your thoughts.

Well, this happened to a friend of mine (posting for him since he doesn't access Reddit) and he is out of options now. Yes, he tried recovering his account with every possible method in his reach, so he had to contact Epic.
It's been two weeks since he is messaging  Epic with EVERY INFORMATION he has about his account, that includes the list of items he bought, the last numbers of his credit card, his personal information and even his xbox and PC IP. He also sent the microsoft emails that confirms that he bought v-bucks.
It wasn't enough, today Epic informed him that the account was sold, not stolen, and that violates the rules from the company, so he won't get his account back. The thing is, there is someone playing using his account, his items, and this person managed to unlink both PC and Xbox from his Epic account and link to a PS account (I still have him as a friend, so it shows up who is using). 
So, this already happened to someone here before? What can he do about it?",FortNiteBR

Outside of a few special customizable skins many of the skins are caucasians. I know that other races are minorities but we all know representation matters. That's not to say that Fortnite is doing a terrible job, but when I check the cosmetics store each day it's often very similar to the previous day. Even the battle pass is that way. I see the upcoming datamined skins each patch and it's always a let down. I know I'm probably in the minority (pun not intended) but I'd really like to see more diversity overall. Especially in a game that's so popular worldwide.",FortNiteBR

""You didin't even revert it correctly, sensitivity and aiming feels completely off.

I was so hyped about Deadzone fix for Xbox when reading Patch Notes, but i guess it was too good to be true. 

So here we are, still huge dead zones and sensitivity feels off. Patch didin't fix the first problem, it brought second one. Can't play the game until sensitivity feels normal again.""

I just switched to a PS4 Pro and new 4K TV. While the game looks great, I feel like my character movement is not as dialed in as it used to be. The character feels slow and sluggish, almost as if the dead zone is huge. I’m having trouble aiming well because it takes too long for my movement to get started, and once it does it moves too fast. Hard to explain, but the sensitivity around 7 is perfect for me.

Anyways I’m looking for ideas to resolve this... is it input lag, controller dead zone, or simply getting acquainted to a new TV and controller? 

Fortnite is the only game I play so I wanted to start here.

Thanks for any help...",FortNiteBR

I dont see any other reason they would be.

Why not make the final couple storms do 2 things:

1. The storm circle forms im the area with the lowest concentration of building, or ""free real estate"". This makes it so that a team cant camp in their huge base the whole endgame.

2. The final couple storms deal damage to buildings. This also forces people out of their bases.

These two changes would make the endgame more fast paced instead of allowing a lucky team to be safe the whole time.",FortNiteBR

Ever since Epic reduced the amount of mats you would have gotten from mining , everyone has been proclaiming:' OMG wtf did epic nerf building?How am i gonna build now? They're obviously favoring those who cant build fast enough.' No, fuck off. First of all if your were dumb enough to think getting that extra 10 wood would even help elevate your already scrublord skills in Fortnite, no you just didn't know how to play against your opponent. ""Oh no, i need to spend 30 minutes mining wood now or else i cant build"" ""building is the core aspect of this game and Epic needs to buff mats so we don't spend our time mining wood"" Say, if you were the one spending 20 minutes mining mats, well I would just be trying my best to get on my opponents, kill them get their loot.

*1.You land strategically on a house *2.You farm up every chair,table,shelf *3. You get 50-100 mats *4. You, having said mats are now able to try and overcome your opponents who ALSO have mats. *5. If you win , you get their mats , you don't, then tough luck. Emphasis on the point where you mine the random objects of your house, and based on all of my friends and my experience you get enough to battle out your town that you landed at. If you were dumb enough to farm wood for 10 minutes, then your hella stupid.You don't need 999 mats to play against your opponents. A lot of people argue building is the core aspect of this game, well have they gotten rid of it? Have they remove the ability to be able to build a high ground? No, all you want is to build a 50x50 Royal Palace.Better yet, why not ask Epic to just give everyone 999 mats at the starting round since farming items seems like a burden to all? 
   You play strategically, you don't ramp rush with &lt;100 wood, you play around your current disadvantage and snipe them with rifles , sneak around them , whatever the fuck. Much like chess, you both have a similar starting, you play by those similar pieces and try to take advantage of your opponents mistakes, not complain when you were the one fucking ramp rushing only to realise you don't enough mats to secure the kill. You play by the rules, not complain of it.",FortNiteBR

Epic should include some sort of incentive to win other than obtaining an umbrella. I believe Vbucks should be a reward - now some people won't like this because then it will increase the amount of tryhards but here's the balance.

People with over 100 wins (Ninja/Myth etc.) should only get about 5 Vbucks per win. Whereas others who barely have any wins should get more. E.g First 10 Solo wins = 250Vbucks per win. This would not only allow people to buy the 2000Vbucks skins but it also gives them a reason to get better at the game. Then possibly after the 10 wins the amount of rewarded Vbucks should lower by say 5. 

Again this is just my opinion, any other suggestions to make this better would be appreciated.

Hey, I’m looking for 3 individuals who have the battle pass and want to grind to level up. 
Req:
1. Must have A mic for when we play
2. Must be 15 yrs or older ( I don’t hate little kids, but playing w them can be quite frustrating so I don’t want the grind to be a hassle or get annoyed ) 
3. Must have discord  ( so we can message each other and coordinate a time where we can all get on and play)
4. Able to play Atleast 3+ hrs during the day (the more we play the better...and this game is fun so time will fly)
5. XP boost doesn’t really matter, but the more you’re able to give out, the better :) 
6. Must be consistent. (Kinda hard to level up with your team if most of the people arent as into grinding as you are...I know I’m not the only one who struggles to grind leveling up since most of my friends aren’t able to play as much as I do)
Feel free to comment down below your PSN username and I’ll add you so we can play. 

My time zone is pacific, so anyone with the same time zone, or close to it would be preferred ( easier to get on if we’re both on at 3 pm instead of one being 3 pm and the other 2 am)

If this gets a lot of attention, I’ll invite everyone who comments  to a discord and we can all be in a group of PS players who are looking to grind but have no one to do it with, and maybe you can get a full squad in for the day. (Also a great way of meeting new people and stuff :) )

Not sure if a post like this has been done before, but I’m making one anyways.

But as far as to why I think there should NOT be a Double XP weekend is for 1 simple fact, Yes it is difficult to achieve level 80 for a lot of people and more difficult for some than others.. 

With that being said, it would be an absolute slap in the face to everyone who spent the time and effort grinding hardcore to level 80 without any assistance from the Devs with bonus XP rewards if near the end of the season they decided to exponentially increase XP gain for all the people that are slacking behind, Yes I said it slackers.

I don't mean to be rude but if you have more important priorities in life than grinding level 80 than you should understand and accept that fact. 

There are a lot of people who have made it a priority to ACHIEVE level 80 this season, and even more so there are a lot of people who have done it or will do it soon with quite a bit of difficulty, especially those solo queue players...


It's like asking for the medal of honor without wanting to earn it through being of service in the military..  Like wanting to win an Olympic gold medal without wanting to join the Olympics, it's a slap in the face to everyone that does go through the difficulty of actually putting in all that effort.


I understand everyone wants all the hard to achieve top unlocks that others have, but it needs to be understood that if you want to get what those people have then you should have to work just as hard. 



TLDR;  This is my in bed @ 2am Reddit post sharing my opinion on why there should NOT be a bonus XP weekend like a lot of people are asking for considering how it would basically be giving the middle finger to everyone that has spent tedious amounts of time grinding their asses off in order to achieve their goal.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is special in a genera which is quickly being over saturated by triple A titles. One of the major things that makes Fortnite different and appealing to many  people is the fast pace of matches and building mechanic. The ability to build is such a monumental part of the game that many people including myself find to be the most creative and interesting feature. Slowly the game has been losing its focus around the building because of the recent changes and players patience being lost after countless hours farming. With material drop rates decreasing and more time spent grinding, less people are able to use the ability to build to the full extent. I suggest that the materials be reverted back to the original state and that any for fun limited time modes should drop large amounts in order to decrease the amount of grinding required, speeding up the game and allowing the players to focus on having fun.",FortNiteBR

Death Animations would allow players to feel *satisfaction* and *confidence* when finishing an opponent who happens to have a custom death animation. Players would have no idea who has these cosmetics until they finish off the player so there wouldn't be a cosmetic placebo like fighting a fully custom illuminated Omega. 

**IDEA**: The more wins you have, the more resilient your death animation would be. At 1000+ wins, your character would hold their chest and extend their arm out as they perish. This would also expose a NoSkin pro smurfs in a fun way.

1. One of the theories that we discussed previously was right! As you can see [here](https://imgur.com/lj0pxyl), the object in the meteor *is* a pod, and the meteor has broken open, plus Visitor has emerged from it. What his intentions are is still anyone's guess, but if I were to make an assumption, he'd probably be evil, given the sinister atmosphere of this loading screen.
2. This may be a bit of a big conclusion, but it appears as though either everyone is blissfully unaware of Visitor emerging from the meteor, or Visitor may have killed any 'scientists' that were studying the meteor, because there's evidence of scientists living there instead of the process of taking apart the meteor being automatic, with things like PCs and potted plants around the research site. If either of these above are true, if Visitor has advanced technology, he could take over the island quickly. These ideas are just spitballing; there's no evidence to them, but it's still something to consider.
3. Unless Visitor is the last of his 'kind', if he truly is an alien, this implies that there is more life in the Fortniverse, suggesting that there could be more alien visitors to Fortnite at some point, for instance if Visitor is confronted and he sends out a distress signal to more of his kind.
4. The reason for having so many astronaut skins last season could mean that somehow Fortnite's scientists could have predicted that a meteor was coming, and everyone should be prepared for leaving for space or something like that. This could explain why a research lab popped up immediately when the meteor impacted. If the scientists detected life on the meteor, then they could be developing some sort of way to go into space and live on a habitable planet.
5. Unfortunately, my time travel theory probably isn't correct. The pod just looks like a mean of transportation, without anything special about it. Furthermore, this means that the dinosaur footprints are *still* unexplained. This may be unrelated, but there are new dinosaur related items that will be in the shop in the future, [here](https://fortniteskins.net/leaked/).  


A lot of the above are just speculating on what could happen, but hey, ~~that's just a theory, a Game Theory~~ one of our last theories was right, so you never know! What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

Tactical SMGs are overpowered. I said it once and I will say it again. Too overpowered. Before the update, tac smgs were annoying, but the shotguns were enough to counter, now, if you are lucky enough to find one shotgun, you still stand no chance against an smg. Late game, if you don't have 2 shotguns you will more than likely lose a fight to someone who does. Taking up two slots with 2 of the same weapon, leaving 2 other weapon slots available, with the 3rd being a heal, is not how the game should be played. 

Mats:

Getting 30 wood-brick-metal from floor loot and/or chests was helpful to early game pressures in high populated areas, but 20? I can only build one wall and one ramp and hope to god that's enough.
Also, combining the nerf with Blitz and 50v50 v3 was a bad idea.

Llama: 

500 mats and tons of every type of ammo was great, since llamas are rare to find.


The rest:

Inconsistent trap damage. 150 is too overpowered, 125 is fine, 75 is underpowered.
Too many things happening + removal of old fortnite. Yes we still have our original locations, but putting a movie set in Moisty, a day 1 location, removing the castle area that came along with the map update, destroying dusty depot and the factory is just making old players like me get tired of it. Not to mention a whole storyline for a free BR game.

In every expansion, there were major items that were readily accessible and easily earned by 95% of the community. Then there were items that were sought out by the hardcore community that only .5% of the population would get.
There are items that I could never get, because time !AND! rng were not in my favor.

Fortnite is free. We support the devs by purchasing the battle pass. To complete the battle pass is so casual. For a game that has a very casual and hardcore fan base, this is the first game I know of that doesn't ""reward"" the hardcore. We don't get anything for wins other than an umbrella. 

The crying on these forums about not being able to acquire the extras is ridiculous and honestly straight up entitled. There is no RNG. There is no luck about the leveling system. It is simply about who put the time in and who didn't.

However there are some countries that did not qualify for the world cup such as:

- USA
- Netherlands
- New Zealand

However, that is not the issue, there are several countries that did qualify for the World Cup and are not included, those include, but are not limited to:

- Peru
- Iran
- Morocco
- Serbia
- Tunisia
- Senegal
- Croatia
- Costa Rica

I just want to inform EPIC, on behalf of the community from these countries, that this is very disappointing. Personally, as a moroccan, I’ve been looking forward to this moment since we qualified.

I was baffled when I noticed that Morocco was not included and didn’t feel like playing the game at all.

EPIC, the world cup is all about representing tour country and that’s all we wish to do in game.

So please, if you are from any of those countries and what your skin in the game or if you believe that it is unfair fir us not be represented:
Please upvote this thread so EPIC can get the message.

—
TL;DR: EPIC should add the skins of all the countries that were qualified for the World Cup.

If I missed any countries in my list, please let me know.

I bought the battlepass, so i expect to get everything by playing normal not with excessive grind.

I totally agree it should be a difficult challenge, but to reach a high lvl is just a grind which needs no skill. 'Hard' to get should mean skillbased not timebased. I'm also playing save the world, which is also a grind, but i can plan it myself. In season 4 i have a deadline, a way to harsh deadline. Epic said the same as in season 3: '75-150 hours to unlock everything.' That's not true! LVL 80 takes way more time.

I want to enjoy the game, so don't force me to watch my gained xp all the time.

I don't want to post a big calculation, but even with max boost and friends boost it takes at least 2 hours a day (including waiting time, spawn island, bus, die in the beginning and watch your team,...). No off days. No missed challenges.

I played normal, i played for fun and was lvl 55 four days ago. That's around 37 % of total xp i need. We didn't even get one day double xp.


I want to see a skillbased callenge in season 5 not a challenge that is considered hard because it needs way to much time. Do something like x amount of wins, x amount of top 10 placements, x out of 10 weeks a K/D over 1, killing x amount of enemies in a single match 5/10/20 times,.... 

Players should have it in there own hand, not by the time they might not have because of work, school, family, friends, or any other important stuff.

Not everyone is able to max out their battle pass nor get to level 80 / 100. I will admit that it is a grind to get to level 80, but if you have friends that are good and have the battle pass level 80 should be a breeze. Even playing solos, winning one would give you around 1k exp. Prior to this update, people stated they would be satisfied reaching level 55 (all armor pieces for omega). Now with this patch introducing that you can change the color of omega, I see more and more posts about people begging for a 2x, 3x, 4x, exp weekend. I grinded to level 80 and had fun while doing so, since I played squads and duos with my friends and when they weren't on I would just play solos. I understand that most people want the full Omega skin, but we got what we asked for, a challenge, and that challenge is time. There is still 3 more weeks worth of challenges and once you hit tier 100 your dailies and weekly challenges becomes converted into exp (500 easy, 1k hard, dailies 1k).

But I don't believe the battle pass is the right place for those items. I know some people will call me entitled, but I believe that as you've payed for the battle pass you should be able to unlock everything while playing on a regular, yet non obsessive, basis. Maybe next season epic could introduce a free skin obtainable at say level 100 or a certain amount of wins or kills. I know this wouldn't directly make them any money, but incentivizing people to play a lot would be worth it for them in my opinion. Reaching level 80 isn't really a skill thing completely, and can be obtained through a crazy amount of grinding so its not like getting maxed out omega is completely skill based anyway. I personally liked the flow of season 3 better but do agree it could have been a little more challenging. Overall i'm really thankful for what epic is trying to do by making more skill based unlockable items I just feel it wasn't implemented as best as it could have been. Do to the facts that I can't play a ton do to time restraints, I don't have a ton of friends to play with, and I was out of town for a week, I am currently at level 50 and am now going to just try and get the omega mask.

I’m not saying I hate Fortnite, or think they’re sexist, or think this is even remotely close to being a major issue with the game, I’m just frustrated haha. 

Lately I’ve been losing interest in Fortnite, and a decent part of that comes (stupidly, I know) from skins. Now I know skins don’t affect the gameplay or change anything other than your character, but to me half the fun of earning levels is looking forward to the cool rewards and earning v-bucks. When the rewards aren’t interesting, and there’s nothing that crazy exciting to spend v-bucks on, it’s hard to want to keep playing. 

There have been a TON of amazing skins being released/leaked lately, but it seems like the only time there’s a new cool looking and detailed girl skin, is when it has a male counterpart as well. It’s been frustrating to constantly see amazing skins like Raven, Leviathan, Moisty Merman, and Flytrap, and not having anything similar, or even different but just as detailed, in a female version. The few female only skins that have been released seem to be far less often, and lack a lot of unique details. This isn’t to say they don’t look nice, but they’re just not anything crazy good/super unique.

The other frustrating thing for me has been the reward skins for challenges and leveling up. Now this season, it was nice to see three girl skins as rewards. The most frustrating thing however, is seeing these new skins you can earn new parts/colors for, but not having a girl one. 

TLDR: Frustrated with the lack of unique girl skins, and losing interest in the game, because of it.

Ever since the shotgun delay was introduced, the game just hasn’t felt the same. Being punished for being a better player and a faster editor really hurt my gaming experience I don’t know how other people feel about it. I used to be able to end a fight in 30 seconds by putting a floor/wall, editing a window and a nice solid one pump to the head. Now I’m stuck building over top of him and waiting for him to push up by building, or the storm pushes us both out and I have to worry about getting shot in the back. I’ve always tried to look at things half full, but I’ve been down this road with a game like Destiny and it sucks watching a game you put so much time into and have so much fun with “dumb” down to side with the casuals of the community. Don’t get me wrong I understand especially now for newer players, it’s hard to jump right into this world and be really good, but that’s what I worked up too. Whenever I saw Ninja, Myth and all these other big streamers I always thought to myself “Wow, I want to work and get up to that level one day”.  I hope newer players feel that same way that I felt, but with that being said all these recent nerfs, you don’t get as many of the “WTF” plays that you can look at and say damn, I could do that if I play the game and get better. 

I guess I could say I’m just frustrated and I don’t wanna see Fortnite go down the path of nerfing everything into the ground to where you can’t have these amazing plays people look up to and want to get better at the game because of it.

Challenges where you can't just buy your way to them are a good idea. I do also believe, however, that level is a representation of how much one plays the game rather than skill (to a degree).

As somebody who works full time and has a significant other and other responsibilities, I can't play as often as some. There are others in the same position as me as well. I was perfectly fine only achieving level 65 and getting the mask for Omega, but after the anouncement of color changes I was disappointed. As it stands I can probably make level 65, but 80 will be almost impossible for me, especially since leveling is harder this season.

By allowing the change of colors at 65 like Carbide, at least those of us who don't have the time to grind out levels can at least change the visor color for Omega, while still lacking the glowing lights on the rest of his body.",FortNiteBR

* Tactics officer is an old skin, in the shop for the first time in 82 days. Red Knight hasn't been in shop for 100+ days. Maybe hinting at bringing old skins back.
* New starter pack skin since Rogue Agent is ending today. The new leaked skin looks to be a red/black pilot theme. Probably coincidence but red is a theme.
* E3 is going on right now. What better time to build hype than e3?

I don't understand why Epic are going in this direction, the unique aspect of the game is building, without it, the game is just any other BR game on the market.

A massive complaint people have is currently how dead the mid-game is and people just camping, but the reason why this is the case is because nobody wants to waste materials mid-game which will ultimately screw them over in the end-game, so everyone waits it out for others to fight. Epic have only made this problem worse.

The amount of building materials we gain needs a massive increase, I'm not just speaking about reverting the nerfs done, it needs a massive boost, I'd say to the rate that the previous Blitz used to drop. This can only help the game with more action and less farming and more opportunity to engage in combat throughout the game.",FortNiteBR

Such as a point blank headshot, Neck Snap, or for lols just push a downed player over and it finishes them off, like flipping a turtle on its back.

Only issue is downed players still have health and that needs to be taken down first, so maybe have the emote take a couple seconds of animation where you are vulnerable.

Okay in all seriousness im over exaggerating but it legit looked like his life depended on finishing me off and game\-ruining . Now i think we can all relate to that one time we got killed in duos or squads early on thus making our team unable to compete with other teams . Now a lot of the times we may get caught off or even like fall from our base but most of the times when you get knocked someones rushes over just to finish you off . What can be done about this is they can make it so you cant be killed if 5\-10 seconds have passed after you have been knocked or if a teammate is within an x\-meter distance from you . Now this will affect a lot of things eg. if you knock someone at the start and you run out of bullets so you have to kill the guy you knocked because his teammate is coming or perhaps when you are 2v2 or 4v4 and you kinda have to kill the enemy to make sure they wont revive their teammate  but im sure if they put their mind to it the epic games team will figure a \*somewhat\* balanced way to make it work,FortNiteBR

332,EversorA,1528748529,8qcotm,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8qcotm/two_common_fall_damage_bugs_explained_many/,17,Two common fall damage bugs explained (+ many examples),"Fall damage in this game seems very **inconsistent** to me and there are two common bugs that I've noticed that are happening to the majority of the people, I'll try to explain whats happening.

&amp;nbsp;

First of all, **how does fall damage work in this game?:** 

Fall damage is based on velocity, which also explains why you don't take damage if you're sliding down from a mountain, as long as you don't speed up to much. This means if you hit the ground with rather high velocity even though you didn't jump down that far, you'll still take more fall damage than if you'd jump down a mountain, but could somehow slow down your velocity without hitting the ground first.

&amp;nbsp;

#Bug 1: Sliding before hitting the ground

This is a common Bounce Pad bug that has been introduced with it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Explaination:** When you slide on a surface, before hitting the ground, you will take fall damage, because the no fall damage effect has been deactivated, but you still kept your momentum.

&amp;nbsp;

**Examples:**

* [Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8pstxu/thank_you_jump_pad_for_breaking_my_fall/)

* [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8pyy33/sign_me_up_for_faze/)

* [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8pce4m/fall_damage_bug_that_has_been_in_the_game_forever/)

* [Example 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ovete/died_to_fall_damage_off_a_bounce_pad_in_a_1v1/)

* [Example 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8q5ol9/bounce_pads_esports_ready/)

and there are many more!

You can see it in every single one of them, slide before ground hit = death.

Proposed solution: Extend the duration of the fall damage immunity, after sliding has been registered, so you still have time to hit the ground without any damage or just don't let sliding break the immunity.

&amp;nbsp;

#Bug 2: The double fall damage bug

This one isn't as popular as the first one, but still happens sometimes. 

Explaination: This has to do with how fall damage works, velocity. You get fall damage a second time, because the first hit didn't stop your momentum, which caused you to get fall damage again.

Examples:

* [Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8l4dkl/double_fall_damage_bug_64_dmg_from_falling_off_of/)

* [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8l24ui/double_fall_damage_bug_insane_50_damage_for_a_4/)

* [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8i89b2/can_we_get_a_fix_for_double_fall_damage/)

* [Example 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8omoxw/double_fall_damage_bugg/)

* [Example 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8465sg/double_fall_damage/)

* [Example 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7ypg11/double_fall_damage_bug/

* [Example 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ksynx/double_fall_damage/) (most likely a mixture between both bugs)

Proposed solution: A fall damage protection for a small time frame, as soon as you get fall damage would fix this, while still allowing you to get double fall damage from let's say if you jump down from two big heights. It definitely shouldn't have occured in the examples above.

&amp;nbsp;

**If this post gains any traction and someone at Epic sees this, I'd also like to report another thing:**

People with german keyboards (like me) don't have a = button, which means we can't speed up the replay system camera speed (we need to restart the game for it and change our keyboard layout in windows). A simple fix for this would be either Keybinds for the Replay system, or changed Keybinds for different Keyboard Layouts. 

More Keybinds would generally be better, because the Quick Drop button isn't keybindable either and it's layed out for qwerty keyboards.

&amp;nbsp;

I thought this was a simple problem with my TV’s display, but the HUD in game fits the screen perfectly fine, meanwhile my character model seems to take up more of the screen (so basically it’s zoomed in is what I’m saying)

On top of this, I feel like my character runs so damn slow. I was trying to outrun the storm, and while I didn’t seem to be running slower, something with the animation was just off. I stared at my characters arms and legs, and it just looks like they’re running in slow motion.

Issues that come to mind:
Blank hitmarkers when swapping weapons too quickly is near game breaking for me - happens in way too many gunfights with double shotguns

changes to lama and materials were both unwanted and unnecessary

Turbo build is quite op imo

Recent changes to shotguns were ridiculous and shotguns have become way more inconsistent - getting 6-15 damage with shotguns and then getting 80+ from the same distance and to the same area of the body

Obviously this last point is subjective but imo recent skin additions have been quite underwhelming and even today’s leaked skins were disappointing - though I do really like the edit style addition to the maxed omega and carbide

* Every game fight ends in Dusty Depot - This is one of the worst changes I've seen in this mode. It's so boring. I'm so sick of end games being around that mountain and that crater. There are so many other places to fight. This change doesn't change the odds for both teams. For example, I've seen Tilted Towers and the mountains near Dusty both win in separate occasions many times depending how well teams played. There also hasn't been much difference which team lands in the circle first either. If you wanted both teams to have equal chance to land in the circle first you could have made both buses go the same direction both opposite side of the map instead of one goes right the other goes left. I don't think that would be the best solution though.
* Larger storm circle - My guess this was done to make players show off the new Thermal Scope Assault Rifle. But making the eye bigger doesn't make it as intense as it were before. I'm not bothered too much about this but still. The original storm eye was just right.
* Lower material gain - So you don't want us to build as much forts now? Building huge fancy forts is one of the best things about 50 V 50. Also, this change promotes players to take longer to gather materials before heading to the circle and lessor amount of forts being built. It's one of the main reasons I like 50 V 50 and I'm sure many others preferred it to make it easier to practise building.

If you are not that good at the game and don't have 3 friends with a battle pass (for the XP boost), you barely get any XP from playing. I have literally been playing the game every single day for about 1 hour since the season began and have completed daily challenges each day and I am still only at lvl 53. At this pace I won't be able to get to lvl 80 for sure. Why is it so hard to get XP in this game? Do you really need to grind for 3 hours each day just to get to lvl 80?

Some suggestions:
● Increase the amount of XP you get from playing the game;
● Increase the amount of XP you get from completing daily and battle pass challenges;
● Give more daily missions (2 missions each day instead of 1);
● Double XP weekends;
● Daily login bonus XP ???

Do you think the amount of XP you get in Fortnite should be increased?

Another thing I have to mention is the toxicity of this subreddit. I feel as if it’s the very reason we see fewer posts with “Epic Comment”

What happened to this sub? Back then, we all got along nicely, no downvotes, etc etc. Now, you get downvoted for actually contributing your opinion and your assumptions. The sub used to be helpful, but now all of you are acting like absolute children.  Hell, even epic employees know this, and sometimes they got shit for it.

BOTTOM LINE I FOUND OUT THAT TO JUST BE AVERAGE YOU SHOULD AVERAGE 1 KILL PER GAME WHERE I AVERAGE 1 KILL EVERY 11 GAMES  . My currents stats are 110 games /10 elimination aka kills AND IF IF OUT OF 75   GAMES I “CAMPED” HALF THE TIME I SHOULD STILL BE AT AT LEAST 34 KILLS WHICH MEANS THAT IM STILL 3 X’S BELOW AVERAGE SO AGAIN FUCK THIS STUPID GAME!!!!!!!!!!
This is the only comment I found that sounds like someone sucks worse than me: ( from Reddit) = this guy average  a kill every 15 matches which is worse than even me . This is the comment :
“Ikr, it's a fuckign marketing trick. I have over 200 games 0 wins and like 10 kills only becuase i die 10 seconds after i land. Fuck this game fuck u epic games”
End this persons post  and back to my post :
———————————————————-
Let me mention that I am a middle aged man who has been gaming for 30 years . Have beaten 100’s of games including the Dark Souls games and beaten some of the hardest bosses video games have to offer. 
Anyway back to the reasons I quit this game probably forever .

A1:- you can’t practice , really practice building for fear of getting killed even in a far away area because of random enemies and the stupid storm and you have to constantly be gathering  materials to build !!?? You also can’t really practice fighting either. 

1. Even if I say that out of 110 matches that half were my younger family members with only 10 kills and I know 3 of them are a younger family members that means out of 94 matches /7 kills = I personally average a kill every 13 runs which means I SUCK and I have no business wasting my time playing when I could be playing another game 
And after googling that the average kill/ death ratio is .90: 
if I played 94 matches I should have 85 kills so at only 7 kills I am 12 x’s worse than the average player so fuck this game!! Especially when an experienced player who average 2 -3 kills a game would be at like 160 or 240  kills in 84 matches and yes I understand that in many cases all they do is probably play every day 4 hours a day 

2. I don’t know when I am going to be attacked vs a regular game that has patterns - = anxiety : even the souls games have patterns 

3. I can’t kill anybody due to them “building “ and I get killed quickly because I can’t “build”. 

4. Apparently I’m not good at aiming because I don’t think I have EVER 1 shot killed anybody and you are considered to suck if you hide in a tree or Bush plus that takes too long and you never really get better at fighting . 

5. There is no beginner level so you are always playing with veterans 

6. These people that are so good at shooters are the same people that play on highest  difficulty level on other shooters when I can beat almost all shooters but only on normal difficulty and I can learn patterns of the A.I. and I remember I sucked at destiny too . I just have to accept that I suck at online games . 

7. It really is a lot like sports in terms of mechanics and muscle memory as in pushing the right button at the exact right time quickly  and accurately is a skill = the same as shooting a basketball with the exact right form and the exact right angle with the exact right amount of power and jump

8. I dreamed about the game which kept me from having good nights rest  which means it addictive which is ok if I’m good at the game but I’m not so again fuck this stupid game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bottom line this game makes me feel like a loser and that is not fun so fuck you epic games for not creating a practice mode or a beginner level so that I CAN DECIDE WHEN I WANT TO raise my level.",FortNiteBR

You actually have to be a little into 68 by Thursday,"Currently I've seen people in this sub mention that they have to be halfway through level 66 by Thursday to be on track to unlock the lights for Omega. However that is not actually the case. You see before Epic pushed back the weekly challenges from resetting from Tuesday to Thursday, there was this post posted by the user /u/Kboy25 

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8hnxcs/weekly_milestone_for_level_80/

The most important thing to take away from this is the following:
(Understand ""by the end of week #, i should be level #"")
•	Week 1 - Level 1st quarter-29
•	Week 2 - Level 41
•	Week 3 - Level mid-49
•	Week 4 - Level 56
•	Week 5 - Level mid-61
•	Week 6 - Level 66
•	Week 7 - Level 70
•	Week 8 - Level mi-73
•	Week 9 - Level end-76
•	Week 10 - Level 80

At the time, Week 6 would have ended today and Week 7 started tomorrow, so you should be halfway through level 66 today. See, they pushed back the weekly challenge reset date, but there is still the same amount of days left in the season. So if you are currently following this guide but assume that you need to be halfway through level 66 by Thursday, you will only have 4-5 days during week 10 to get your 7 days worth of Xp to be level 80, so you would either come up a level or two short or grind way more than you would have thought. 

I personally use this guide by /u/bkay16 which breaks down what you should be in terms of level by DAY so you don't have to go by the guide above

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8m1mbj/i_made_a_guide_for_what_season_level_you_should/

So following this guide, by then of today, June 11th, you should be almost halfway through level 66

Hopefully this helps people get on track and not end up a little short by the end of the season as I understand people don't always have the time to play a lot. ",FortNiteBR

I know we shouldnt even be able to make an account due to sanctions and Epic not adding the skin is because of that

But Iran is qualified for WC and all of us really want have that skin.

I understand Thanos being limited time only, but Teams of 20 is apparently now going away soon? That's just great. My favorite new game mode is limited time only for, as far as I can see, just some arbitrary reason. Now I learned that jetpacks are also temporary? I just won a game of duos last night with an awesome aerial rocket launcher attack thanks to my new love, the jetpack, but now I guess I'd better not get used to it since it's temporary. I just don't understand why Epic keeps adding great stuff that I really like only to take it away from me a few weeks later. I'd prefer you not even give me a jetpack if it's just going to be taken away from me as soon as I start having a ""blast"" with it. Oh but of course, the useless ass bush is here to stay apparently. I'm sorry but this doesn't make sense to me, it seems completely arbitrary and designed to generate hype or something. Either way it just kind of sucks that they can't just leave some of this stuff there once they added it. That's all, just a small rant, hopefully someone can tell me why they do this crap.

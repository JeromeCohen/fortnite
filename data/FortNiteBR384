Just excited and wanted to share it with someone who cared,"Though my girlfriend knew I was excited, she could probably care less. After almost 4 months of on and off play, I finally won a solo match! Nothing fancy, didn't even realize how far I was until I looked up and saw only 2 players left. At about the same time I noticed this, I heard the click of a gun switch. Jumped and got shot by a bush, but proceeded to light them up in the face with my purple scar. Sweet satisfaction! I finally didn't choke and sealed one whole win for myself. At least it's progress",FortNiteBR

Here’s why:","For those of you unaware, Fortnite for iOS seems to detect if a jailbreak or even Cydia (jailbreak AppStore) is installed and crashes itself immediately.

Why? Why epic?

I jailbreak my phone for extra features and customization, not to cheat, as do many others.  I’ve spent 30$ on this game in the past month on useless cosmetics and I cant help but feel cheated that I’m not going to be able to play with all of my other friends on fortnite for iOS. 

Here’s why blocking jailbroken devices is bullshit:

1) You might as well ban PS4 too. See r/ps4homebrew , a community dedicated to jailbreaking the PS4. 

2) People dont jailbreak their devices to cheat. The majority of jailbreakers are interested in features, not cheating. I’ve been in the jailbreak community for years, and hate the stereotype that jailbreaking = piracy and cheats. This isn’t true. I’d say only 1/10 of people who jailbreak actively cheat, and banning thousands of potential customers because of that minority isn’t fair.

3) The detection detects the Cydia app file itself, not even the jailbreak. Even when the jailbreak is inactive, the detection still catches you and crashes. Even when my phone isn’t jailbroken, and I have no way of modding the app, I cant use Fortnite.

4) there will always be a bypass. Someone will always evade the jailbreak detection, as we have in Snapchat for years. This only inconveniences the user, and is not ideal.

Epic, cmon man. I’ve been a fan of your work ever since I played Robo Recall and used Unreal, don’t join the dark side.

Edit: and there’s [already a bypass!](https://reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/84pzgj/_/dvriani/?context=1)

Shields as a whole aren’t that bad but the fact that lucky players who arent very good can survive fights they never deserved to win bugs me a lot. it also makes lucky players think they’re good when they’re just lucky. Another idea i had was to change the way shields are acquired. maybe killing players earns you some shield instead of hoping you find them in chests.

this is just an idea. it’s probably been suggested and hated on before, so don’t try to kill me please haha

and no i’m not just salty (but that’s definitely part of it), this seems like something that genuinely could be changed in the game.",FortNiteBR

Pros:

Everything is easily accessible

Aiming is hard

It is really hard to Move and Fire at the same time. (Tap to shoot while moving joystick while swiping.)

Streamers have greatly added to that level of entertainment.

Adding pinpoint / 100% accurate weapons will crush a lot of that entertainment value. It will make the fps gamers suddenly that much better than their counterparts. It will make running in the open far more dangerous and slow the game down. A lot.

It will make players resort to a safe, calculated style of game play rather than just going crazy. 

I think this is the reason we haven't heard much from Epic regarding shooting mechanics... Why would they risk potentially alienating large parts of their massive player base?

I'd like to see fortnite continue as it is. It's obviously working. Does missing a number of AR hits on a target feel bad? Sure. But the game is a building game and anyone who says that they purely died because person A's AR hit more than theirs isn't really playing the game optimally. 2 people standing and shooting at one another in a field will have a 50/50 effect. A player using cover and building will sway the fight massively in their favor.

Anyways, I know this is an unpopular opinion but it's one that I believe several pros have voiced and I think they're generally right. ",FortNiteBR

Was amazing even though it was tough find people heh.

Gameplay is very smooth, had minimal issues with collecting mats building and switching to weapons. There was a bug where I was trying to click minis that I just picked up but kept shooting my gun instead. A fix was to open the inventory click on the minis close and they would finally be accessible. My main gripe at the moment is not being able to switch the button layout of jump and crouch. Seem to be getting those mixed all the time.

Phone did run pretty hot for a full lengthed game.

As well stats aren't saved. So that's a shame. But its a beta so it's understandable.

But Jesus Christ how harsh this game is for newbies! Ok, understood I'm not gonna win in my first 50 matches or even reach to the final 20, but now I've played almost 100 matches and have maybe 6 kills - all lucky. Today I've played like 20 matches in a row and died after 5-10 mins in every one of them. Yesterday I had really nice people in my team and we've reached final 6 or so, but that was the only match from 100 I really enjoyed.
People sneak on me from behind, over my head and shoot me like a scum every time. And also so called ""teammates"" tend to land in the most crowded area and die immediatly.
Game seems very nice, but why noobs are forced to play against skilled players I can't understand. That is so frustrating most newbies will just leave after few matches.",FortNiteBR

When I first downloaded Fortnite, I, like many others, skipped the Epic account creation pop-up. I hadn't even played the game yet so I didn't have any interest in creating an account.

Nowadays, I'd love to play with PC friends from my PS4. So I decided to sign up on their website and then connect that account to my PSN username.

Little did I know that you have to sign up a very specific way for this to work, something I believe most only realize after failing to do it the normal way. Unfortunately, **the email address and username that are connected to my headless account are the same email address and username connected to my Epic account**, making it impossible to consolidate and sign up the proper way.

Looking at how the direction of the game has become more defined over the course of the last few months it's admittedly not even a great idea but an idea none the less. 

GADGETS! Or ""Armor,"" or whatever you want to call it (anything sounds better than gadgets.) Essentially what this would be is the inclusion of armor that provides bonuses to you. For example;

Footwear that allows you to walk and run on water.

Footwear that prevents fall damage. 

Footwear that allows you to have a double jump. 

Foot/legwear that allows for an increase in movement speed.

Chest armor that allows for a continuous shield and or health regeneration of 25 shields/health that is the same rate of a slurp juice. 

Gloves that allow for more melee damage in your pickaxe so you do more damage with your swings which allow for more efficient harvest collection. 

Helmets that make enemies highlighted when zoomed in.

Helmets that show the health of enemies.

There are a plethora of ideas here, and how the armor would work is just like any other item in the game, when you pick it up, it stays in your hot bar, and as long as it's in your hot bar, the bonus is provided for you. The armor doesn't have to appear on characters bodies because I realize with the inclusion of skins into the game it would make characters appear clunky? The primary influence I initially had when thinking of this idea is Tek Armor in Ark: Survival Evolved and all of the amazing bonuses they provide.

My idea is to have the entire map flooded. With this being said you can still see a lot of the map peaking up above such as tilted towers etc and most buildings (mainly the ground area is flooded).The main idea of the level is you jump out of the bus and wherever you land there is a 6x6 floor below you that spawns. You know need to start building your base/boat and you have around 1 minute to do so. After the minute ends everyone can exit there area. As previously stated the entire map isn’t water so you will still be able to loot buildings just basically being that the ground isn’t touchable and you would lose health if you do so. I would also add that everyone has 999 of each resources and it stays unlimited so that you can get to the other side of the map if you wanted to do so.

They could even add a random spawned boat with several llama drops inside.

Most people will probably find this retarded but this was literally a shower thought and I decided to share it with you all to see what your thoughts are.",FortNiteBR

*Crossplay tutorial*

things needed: *2 PC’s, either XB1 or PS4* depending on what console you are on. keep in mind XB1 and PS4 cannot play together.

if you are on XB1 or PS4 you will need to have your account linked to an Epic account if you don’t already. once you have that done go ahead and download the Epic Games launcher from the [website](www.fortnite.com).

once you have downloaded the launcher go ahead and sign into your Epic account. now, you’re signed in what next? go ahead and send a friend request to your friend that is on PC. you can do this by clicking the icon at the top of the [launcher](http://oi66.tinypic.com/2hid08o.jpg).

once you have your friend added, go ahead and load up a lobby on Fortnite and make sure that your privacy is set to Public. from here your PC friend will have to click your name on their friends list and press “Join party”.

*reminder: for XB1 users if crossplay isn’t working for you, go ahead and load up StW and you should be prompted with a confirm window for crossplay. (haven’t seen many people with this issue just a heads up).*

*Cross progression tutorial*

for cross progression all you will need to do is make sure your XB1 or PS4 account is linked to an Epic Games account. once you have that done start up the Epic Games launcher, launch Fortnite and you shall be good to go.

The reload time is way too fast. Either make it longer, or make it reload after the missile has exploded. The current spam rate is just rediculous and so is the blast radius.

Limit max ammo to ~10 rockets to prevent spam and promote tactical use. Something like that.

Step 1: Log in to the Epic Games website as the PS4 player's Epic Games account. 

Step 2: Link the PSN account with the Epic Games account in the top right corner. 

Step 3: Give the PC player (THAT YOU TRUST) your Epic Games log in information. 

Step 4: Log in to the PS4 player's Epic Games account via the Epic Games Launcher on your PC. 

Step 5: Send the PC player's Epic Games account a friend request with the PS4 player's account.

Step 6: Log in with the PC player's Epic Games account on the Epic Games Launcher and accept the friend request.


The process of set up is done! Here's how you join:


Step 7: Launch Fortnite on the PS4 and on the PC. (Both players should be logged into their OWN accounts.)

Step 8: Let the PS4 user make a lobby. 

Step 9: On the PC player's Fortnite, go to the top right corner, click on the icon that looks like 3 people.

Step 10: Click on the PS4 player's username in that menu and click ""Join Party"" (If it isn't there, remake the lobby and make sure it is public.)

Step 11: Ready up and figure out where to drop!

I hope this tutorial helps someone, me and my brother do this all the time to play!

Good luck!

2. If i place a C4 but don't detonate it, can I place another C4? If so, does the 2nd C4 replace the first, or will both be planted an explode at the same time?

Why not fix it?,"Seems like the thing I see people complain about the most on here, in popular memes, fortnite  facebook communities etc is the inconsistency of shotguns. I think we have all seen hits inexplicably for 7 and 24. Initially the feedback was ""your aim is bad."" Then streamers began replaying it in slow mo and with perfect aim getting crazy low head shots. 

The general opinion that I have seen is that this is caused by Pellet RNG. That the gun in total shoots a bunch of pellets and all have their own RNG path so even with the reticle at close range, ADS, crouching, perfect aim etc the pellets could choose to shoot in a wierd pattern having all but 1 miss giving you seven damage.

In addition from personal experience I have found that wierdly at extreme close range I am more likely to get randomly low numbers whereas if the target is the distance of 2 floor tiles away getting a head shot over 100 damage seems to be very easy and consistent. Has anyone else noticed this? 

Could this not easily be fixed by having shot guns fire a slug? The gun could have perfect aim for 10 meters and after that have greater and greater RNG as distance increased? That would seem to solve the problem of random low damage shots and you wouldn't be sniping with it.",FortNiteBR

Everyone expected that most of the playerbase would be landing there for perhaps a week or two. However it stuck and now every match has 30% of the players going there, which is slowly making the mid game more and more boring. 

I propose one of two things;

1st: Re-locate them. One reason why allot of people drop there because the POI is very centralized. Therefore the battle bus goes near them almost every time. If it was a bit more on the edge of the map, maybe this would discourage some of the players going there.

2nd: Downsize it. Make it smaller not in terms of height but width. Also one of the reasons it's so popular is because you can drop virtually anywhere and still get a gun. Giving them a fighting chance. If you would make it smaller and therefore less floor spawns, people might look to drop anywhere else and have a better chance of survival. 

Those are just my 2 cents. What are your opinions? Do Tilted Towers need a re-design? And if so, what would you change? ",FortNiteBR

What in the world... I feel like this mainstream validation for online gaming taken to a whole new level. 

To give some context: Even my city's newspaper is posting about this stream on Facebook, that is unheard of and to the confusion of many older folks in the comment section, haha.

Feels pretty euphoric to have been on this ride since October, seeing the game truly become a phenomenon. Massive urban instagram accounts that have nothing to do with gaming are posting memes/clips daily, parents are going on the news to say their 10-year-old can't handle the game so it should be *banned.* Walked into the windows store at the mall and every screen was playing Fortnite, most with a small crowd gathered around watching.

The last time I felt this kind of golbal community was when I was 13 and the last Harry Potter book came out, when we all waited in a massive line at midnight to get the book, seeing half the town there giddy with anticipation. 

This has been such a fun ride, thanks Epic, truly.

I'm starting to think the reason the shooting model isn't changing is out of fears that it will drive away players who aren't good and therefore cause Epic to make less money theoretically.

Hardcore players will stick the game out regardless because it's (IMO) the best BR game on the market in terms of gameplay and stability, and the amount of skilled players who will leave due to being sick of bloom is probably lower than the amount of poor players who would leave out of frustration if a recoil-based model was put into play.

Got some questions.,"Hi, yeah I started playing casually a few weeks ago but got really into it a few days ago as I sometimes do get obsessed with things. Started playing this game a lot. Not very good at it yet, no victories aside from 20 v 20, but I do have some questions, quite a few in fact.

1. Why do people prematurely jump? Especially in Squads or 20 v 20 where you team is trying to go to the same place. I often find I'm one of the first because I wait until the exact opportune moment to jump closest to the point but I see people jumping way back. This really staggers the team and I find it sometimes causes problems if another team is more like me they get the loot and wipe our team a lot more often.

2. Why do people want to congregate together a lot, and why do they feel hunting kills is a better game plan than surviving? I often find I make it father in solo games by jumping where not too many people are, getting a lot of the loot and being smart, crouching around if I see an enemy, waiting on them. Sometimes I'll sit inside a house for a minute or even longer listening to them run around until they enter the room I'm in and gank them. I think it's a pretty good strategy, although I've yet to win in the end where of course you need to be a bit more aggressive. It really confuses me as to why a ton of people jump right as soon as you can or alternatively jump a ton of them over one specific popular hub like tilted towers or retail row.  When you go to places less traveled you get all the loot. Or most of the loot and it's easier to tell where people have been so you can hunt them down. I guess I feel playing conservatively, looking out around you and making moves from cover to cover is better because I tend to make it towards the end a lot despite not winning yet. It'll come some day I hope! My aim just isn't great and I'm still getting used to the whole building thing so I can do it faster. So yeah I get there with 2-4 kills, but I make it farther in the game. Isn't that the objective, to survive and battle it out as far as you possibly can?

3. People who leave immediately why? It doesn't really make sense. I've watched come backs from smaller teams or even a solo guy getting to at least second or sometimes winning when our team might've been the lowest! I know people want to get in on the action but....at the cost of throwing away a potential victory?

357,cheesymacgyver,1521073022,84ibxe,40,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/84ibxe/changes_that_are_lowering_the_skill_ceiling/,3,Changes that are lowering the skill ceiling (double pump/jump fatigue/pickaxe MS/shotgun inconsistency),"     1. Double pump.
- Lower clip size, slower reload speed, lower damage a bit or anything else you could come up with. The
current pump feels awkward to use and it used to be one of the most fun weapons. All of these changes would have nerfed the strategy rather than removing it. If you really need to remove it just don't let people pick up 2 and leave the gun alone.

      2. Random shotgun spread.
- To make shotguns feel more consistent and rewarding they should really use a fixed spread pattern. This will likely lead to higher damage numbers at mid range, tweaking damage will be required.

     3. Quote about pump changes and other changes in the future.
-  ""This feature will only be enabled for Pump Shotguns, but we will closely monitor other weapon types for similar concerns.""

- Nobody knows exactly what this means, I assume its something to do with revolvers/hand cannon and maybe the double tactical shotgun.

- As someone who really enjoys pressing a lot of buttons while aiming (R.I.P Gunz the duel). This Quote scares me because honestly I feel all the double X strategies require enough dexterity from the user that they don't need balancing and should not be completely removed.

- I'm not saying to balance Fortnite around an ancient game like Gunz, its just the only other game I could think of that has double pump. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgmPpd9Qbz4

- Maybe this is a bad point. I just love strategies and things that are hard to do but very rewarding, double pumping in FN is definitely not as taxing as anything in Gunz but I hope the comparison is at  least a little bit fun to think about.

     4. Lowering movement speed while swinging the pick-axe.
- Why are we slugs when farming materials? This is one of the most common things a player has to do and at the same time one of the least fun why make it take longer? for the sake of 1 out of 10 games someone gets pickaxed before finding a gun. Too real https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/83ydwy/trying_to_explain_the_basics_of_the_game_to_my_gf/

     5. Jumping multiple times in a row results in not being able to move at all?
- I assume this was mainly put in for console as it seems much harder to hit someone who is mashing jump. Any experienced PC player can tell you that in any game without airstrafing jumping is one of the most predictable things you can do. It is a very easy way for a good player to exploit a less experienced one.


- Perfect example of this https://clips.twitch.tv/ExquisiteSillyAnacondaJebaited both me and my partner knew exactly the moment to shoot, you can hear me saying ""im shooting right..... now"" just waiting for the enemy to jump and my teammate was on the exact same page.


- I don't know if epic will ever change certain things based on the platform but this is a real killer for me. It just slows the game down for no reason, imagine how much faster good PC players could build without this clunky console jump cooldown. It feels really bad to be restricted on how fast you can go  by the game itself and not by your fingers and own ability.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry this was so long but I put a lot of thought into it and I hope anyone who reads it weather you 

agree or not had fun thinking about my points. 

**ULTRA TL:DR**

**Double pump**: Id rather the strategy get nerfed and not removed

**Shotgun Spread**: this video explains how it works in Team Fortress 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?

v=zXlbdaJC-nQ

**The future of changes toward double X strategies**: I hope the dexterity required to pull off these 

strategies balances them out and if not that they get nerfed rather than removed.

**Decreased movement speed while pickaxing**: going fast is fun and I wouldn't mind someone hitting me 1-2 more times with a pickaxe before I find a gun so that every single game for the entire game I can collect materials quicker.

**Jump cooldowns**: IMO isnt required on PC and is just restricting good players from being good. Someones practice and speed should be rewarded not punished because its hard to hit a jumping player on console or mobile.

You don't need something that fancy to run it and it does pretty well overall with a [49% Percentage passed on Can You Run It](https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri) *– scrolldown a bit to see it*.

i just bought myself a laptop (brazilian, brand doesn't matter) with the following specs:

Intel HD Graphics 4000  
8GB Ram  
  
I didn't really care about it running Fortnite or not because I already have a Desktop that runs it pretty smoothly on High. HOWEVER, I downloaded and tested it anyways.

Very badly though, nearly unplayable. Mainly because of the Intel 4000 HD built-in graphics card.  
  
This made me wonder: **why not get what is ready for Fortnite Mobile and release it for PC?**

It's a win-win situation, Fortnite gets more players and casuals get Fortnite!

**Jump Pads** are often referred to as *Meme Pads* or *Trampolines*.

Due to the design of the Shield Potion, **Shield Potions** and **Small Shields** are often called *big* and *small pots* respectively.

Both the **Boogie Bomb** and the **Impulse Grenade** are sometimes referred to as *Meme Grenades*, but after the impulse was released, the phrase has shrunk to mainly that.

**Tactical Shotguns** are almost always referred to as a *tac*, and the **Pump Shotgun** to *pump*. Both are referred to as *shotties*.

The Epic and Legendary tiered **Assault Rifles** are called SCARs. The models of these guns were made in the likeness of an actual gun, abbreviated the SCAR. (Some will also refer to standard **Assault Rifles** (rare tier and lower) as M-16s. Again, the guns were modeled after it.)

Standard-tier **Assault Rifles** are usually called *ARs*.

Similarly, **Suppressed SMGs** are often called TEC-9s, or just TEC. these guns are also based on real guns. (**Tactical SMGs** are sometimes called *tacs* as well, but this gets confusing since that name describes a shotgun as well.)

The **Hand Cannon** is often referred to as the Deagle, named after the real gun, the IMI Desert Eagle.

People who hide in bushes are referred to as *bush wookiees*.

*Other Things*

The tallest building in **Tilted Towers** is usually called *Trump Tower*.

The gas station and house above **Flush Factory** is colloquially called *chair,* due to the presence of an oversized wooden chair.

The buildings immediately to the west of **Anarchy Acres** are called *Motel*

The buildings immediately to the east to **Junk Junction** are called *Broken Castle* or *What the fuck is this place but it has a lot of loot*.

The buildings to the west of **Tilted Towers** are called *Soccer Field* or just *YMCA*.

The equally-sized complex to the north-east of **Flush Factory** is called *fake factory* or *the pallet place* (it has a lot of those).

The place below **Lonely Lodge** is called *snake*, *squiggly line*, or what it actually is, *racetrack.*

I started the game a couple months ago and since then have played 1000+ matches.  I absolutely love it.  One of the most satisfying parts of the game is a sweet sweet bolt action kill from a distance.  However, lately I’ve noticed that when I finally land a shot with a bolt actions, I rarely actually get the kill.  I’ll hit them in the body (ik ik get good) and they will either build or run away or jump around and make it hard to reload and hit them. 

Please let me know if you’re different but I think of the bolt action sniper as a 1 hit one kill gun.  For me, that’s why it only has one bullet in the clip.  It does 105-116 damage depending on rarity. 

My point is that with the advent of extra shield options, the bolt action sniper has lost its luster as a dangerous gun because the target can just eat the shot and then recover easily instead of dying.  I think that since it is very common for players to have 150 health+shield, the bolt action sniper should be pushed to 150+ damage. Players smart/lucky/good enough to have shields stacked abnormally high are rewarded like before and the average joe is 1 shotted like before.  

If the shotguns can end half of my matches in one shot with a lucky headshot at 150 health, why can’t a skillful sniper shot do the same?

Was happy with my purchases, thought nothing of it, time marched on.

Last night, I had some issues logging in. Figuring at first I'd just aped out and was mistyping my password, I eventually went on to resetting it and knew something was up. Went I got in, I found that my battle pass had been boosted to 100, a slew of skins had been purchased from the shop, and 40k V-bucks were attached to my account. Immediately, I went through all the steps to resecure things, changed email passwords, game passwords, disputed the $400 worth of charges on PayPal, contacted my bank, went to haveibeenpwned to see how many breaches my email had, and attached 2F authentication onto my Epic Games account (admittedly, I hadn't know they had this beforehand).

After resecuring everything, I've opened a ticket and DMed a few of the flaired Epic employees on the Fortnite subs. As it seems that *this* is the quickest—and, scarily perhaps only—way to really get their attention, I'm also making this post and doubling it as a reminder, as well as to dispel some of the armchair cybersecurity I've been seeing on similar posts.

**Main Points:**

* No, not everyone who's had their account compromised is falling for Nigerian prince schemes and getting phished on ""Vbucks generators."" While I am sure SOME people *do* fall for those, that is not so commonplace as to explain all of these accounts being compromised. Anecdotally, I can confidently say I've not fucked with anything that stupid, and nothing else on my PC/in my life has been compromised, JUST my Epic account: the password I used for it was one of the rarest I use in a group of a dozen+ passwords/variations I have.

* While I can't concretely explain the skins/battle rank/all that, one of the charges was for a Super Deluxe version of the game. It's likely that these are purchased on the regular account holder's dime and then the bonus CD keys received are peddled off on third party markets for cheaper than Epic Games sells them, thus explaining WHY people's accounts are being targeted. I can only assume the rest of the purchases are made on the off-chance that the account isn't reclaimed, and/or just to fuck with the account holder.

**Suggestions:**

* I'll admit this is probably my ego speaking, but as someone who's gamed online since he was a little lad and has never had an account compromised, this was sobering. I pride myself on my ""can't get got"" mentality; I've seen friends lose accounts and money by the dozens over the years, always thinking ""well, I don't click on sketchy links or download shady files, it won't be me."" Clearly untrue. As such, DO THE SAME. Remember to **UNLINK YOUR PAYMENT INFORMATION** (per /u/wimpoy, go through the Epic Games website -&gt; account -&gt; payments). Epic Games autosaves your information and as best as I can recall, they don't tell you that. Individuals with unauthorized access can't really do anything with your account/won't want to if there's no payment method saved on it. What are they going to do on a free to play account, queue for a match and ruin your stats?

* Make SURE your Epic Games password is **ENTIRELY UNIQUE.** A lot of cybersecurity can really be summed up as a battle between safety vs. hassle. ""There's a slim chance it happens to me, it isn't worth all the trouble of having a password manager or having dozens of unique passwords for individual things,"" you might say. Unfortunately, while I don't want to fearmonger, any Google search will show that this is a bit of an epidemic in this game. I'm not in a qualified or informed enough position to talk about the *why*, but undeniably, it is safer to err on the side of caution and take any extra measures you can with your Epic Games account.


* **ENABLE TWO-FACTOR AUTHENITCATION.** This should be obvious, but I don't feel like this feature is very well-advertised. A lot of games/companies shove their security down your throat: I didn't know Epic Games had this as an option until it was too late. Yes, you can blame me for my negligence, but that won't accomplish anything. Just help spread the word that way future cases can be avoided.

Just looking for some help/info.

I bought the game on PC on the 22nd Feb, however i hadn't realised that i wasn't allowed to use my xbox linked epic account.

I sent the customer service an email explaining the situation on the same day (22nd Feb) and havent heard anything back since.

Also i tried again on 4th March in case i had messed the original email up some how.

Currently i am using an alternate email account to play the game but want to be able to use my paid version.

My question is, Do Epic/Fortnite customer services usually take this long to reply or are they really that bad with service to their consumers??

So instead of just making a new type of gun that is used to take out other players,  there  should be a gun that shoots prebuilt structures

So this new gun goes in your regular 5 slot carry and take 100 material to load.  When you shoot this gun it acts like a shotgun but instead of shooting pellets it shoots built structures (walls, stairs, that odd triangle etc...) and shoots 8-9 pre built structures.  Yes you should looses a little each pull because it would be a faster way of getting built structures into the battle which can be used for cover or a start to a new building.   

This new gun won’t cause any damage to enemy players and needs more then lets say 3 building spaces before the structures can be shot out of the gun and placed in game 



My thought on this is, why have a bunch of guns/pickups that are mainly for killing the enemy teams.   Lets get a gun that can help you and your team when being attacked by others.  Plus when you have 3 people down in squads and your being attacked,  you can shoot this and hopefully distract the other team/teams and get some teammates up

When under fire, the fence will always be where you were going to place that wall.

You will only remember that you were not the one who placed that trap after it has already hit you.

If you are in a building battle, the enemy will invariably have more materials than you do.

If you have just jumped down from a ledge, you will find that you can't build there. 

If you have just found and used a big shield potion, the next chest you open is guaranteed to have mini shield potions.

The most likely time for the enemy to place a wall down in front of you is just after you have fired that rocket.

If you have your bolt action sniper rifle pointed at someone and are waiting for them to stand still, someone else will already have their bolt action sniper rifle pointed at you.

Don't look conspicuous, it draws fire. 

Incoming fire has the right of way.

If a third party enters your ongoing fight, they will always be shooting at you first.

The problem with the easy way out is that someone has already placed a trap there.

If the next circle has a convenient high ground, someone will already be holding it.

If you happen to check a bush, noone will be camping in it. If you overlook a bush, someone is guaranteed to be camping in it.

If it's stupid but works, it isn't stupid.

Teamwork is essential, it gives them someone else to shoot at. 

There is always a way, and it usually doesn't work.

If your attack is going well, then it's an ambush. 

If your ambush is properly set, the enemy won't walk into it.

The one item you need is always in short supply. 

If you go in through the bottom floor and your opponent enters through the first floor, the shotguns will spawn on the first floor. The order is reversed if you go in through the first floor.

Fortify your front; you'll get your rear shot up.

RPG's are an area support weapon.

The guy waiting for you around the next corner always has a pump shotgun.

The guy you're trying to assault on the high ground always has an RPG.

If the enemy is in range, so are you.

If you build yourself a base that's tough for the enemy to get into quickly, then you won't be able to get out of it quickly either. 

When your teammate starts to laugh and says ""watch this"", get in position to rez them.

If both sides are convinced they're about to lose, they're both right. 

Your stairs will always rotate at the most inconvenient time.

Try to look unimportant, they may be low on ammo. 

If you think you'll die, don't worry you won't.

The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions:

* when you're ready for them.

* when you're not ready for them.

If a grenade looks like it may bounce in one of a number of directions it will most likely bounce back at you.

The damage radius of a grenade is always one foot greater than your jumping range.

The competence of your next opponent is inversely proportional to the amount of hitpoints you have at the beginning of the engagement. 

If everything is going well, you must have overlooked something.

Anything you do can get you killed, including nothing.

It took a while to finish so when I got home I logged in and played my first ever online PC game. What I mean is I am an Xbox one player and have never had a PC that was good enough to play any games on. So when I loaded up the game on my laptop (ill list laptop specs below) I had to use the worst settings possible, I mean the lowest possible settings you can go on the game. I got into a match and initially was using the keyboard and trackpad and man was it hard and after a while of looting like this I did hide and hook up my xbox one controller which helped a lot. So basically I hid took some pot shots at some things I think were players and next thing I know its 5 people left than 3 than just me and one guy. He goes to loot his kill I point my crossbow and somehow kill him and win the game. This was not skill I am not gloating this was pure luck. My first ever online match on PC and on Fortnite and I won. I now have a 100% win rate on the PC in Solos. 

My Laptop Specs 
Make//Proccessor:  Asus//AMD A10-9620P RADEON R5, 10 COMPUTE CORES 4C + 6G 2.5 GHz

 I think I posted correct info about my laptop specs. Again I am not gloating or saying I have any super skill I play on xbox regularly but have only won solos twice. To me this is just so funny and so lucky especially since I do watch some you tubers and streamers and have seen them take a bit to get the first solo win so just the simple fact I did it by luck on a laptop on my very first time on PC in my first match. 

My gamertag on Xbox and PC is THAT Townz you can search it up and see. This might also be something that has happened before or often and I just do not know about it but for me personally its hilarious and my only and greatest Online PC achievement.

TL;DR
 I have only ever played one PC game online ever and only 1 match. It was a match of Solo's Fortnite. I did it on a basic laptop with an Xbox controller. On the worst settings the game has and I won. Luckiest win ever???

PS
Sorry I do not post very often and I am not very good at this so I apologize for any errors. Also I have a video of the win as well, sadly I didn't know how the capture worked and I started recording after the shot (and a mini high pitched freakout) Once I figure out how I will post it if people wanna see it.

Edit #1: I think this is correct. If posting a link like this is wrong than everyone can know I am a reddit noob when it comes to posting. Below I will post a link to the video I captured. Its not good as again my laptop is nothing special. Its all I have to prove this and I am not faking it at all. I have played one solo match and I won again by pure skill. Also I know I do not have a 100% win rate actually Im sure more games need to be played for it to actually count. It just funny to me when you search my gamertag and see my stats it says 100% win rate 1 game 1 win.

For example: Cuddle Team Leader would come with the skin, the bow backbling, and since its a valentines day skin it could have hearts as the contrail. So if you see someone falling with hearts coming out you would know that they own the Cuddle Team Leader skin.

Never have I played a game that has the amount of issues with shotguns as this game. Between doing 0 damage and 9 or less every shotgun fight is just a game of dice. Posts pop up all day every day showing the inconsistencies, and yet sadly it has only become more common for them to do sub par damage.

I know you devs play too so you can't tell me that you don't have this issue happen. Why is this still being shoved to the back burner? My play time has been cut in half because I'm tired of it and I have a few friends that are refusing to play until it is fixed. If I don't hit all my pellets then I don't expect full damage, I get that. But all too often you can put your barrel to someone's stomach and get 7 dmg or worse (I just got a 5 at point blank, dude had his back to me). Tell me how any pellets would miss when the barrel is forcing entry in the opponents belly button or spine. Just tune in to some peoples stream, it wont take long at all before you witness a low damage shot and the confusion on the streamers face.

I enjoy this game a lot but between all of the bugs, bloom, and shotgun inconsistencies it is getting harder and harder to want to play. Everyone has been asking that you focus on bugs and you did good last week by not adding another item and fixing some issues, though with the mobile release it will probably bring a lot more bugs to work on. After only one week though you are adding in another new item. Clear your plate before eating dessert, please.

Edit: to clarify I do not want full damage for all shots no matter the pellets. Some low damage shots are required to balance shotguns obviously (distance,pellets, and where the pellets hit). I get that that is a lot of data being sent and received at once and likely the ping/latency is causing some shots to do lower damage than intended. I'm just asking that they work on a way to make it not happen as often due to latency/ping.

This sub is constantly having videos posted showing questionable damage on shots, I'm making this in hopes of seeing less.",FortNiteBR

Why are things taking so long for the shooting model to improve or see meaningful changes?

The bloom issue has sucked all but every bit of fun out of playing this game anymore, for me. I log in and play just for as long as I can tolerate the game's shooting model to stay praticed for when changes do come.

The game is otherwise brilliant and fantastic, and incredibly fun to play. 

But when I put a crosshair on someones head, and see 10 bullets from 1st shot to last simply go everywhere except hit them... it's discouraging. And it makes me not want to play the game anymore.",FortNiteBR

I’ve had friends tell me this too.  Fortnite should make an are you sure button before buying an item instead of just buying it by hitting one button. This has never happened to me but I don’t want it to. What do you guys think?,FortNiteBR

I've decided that i'd like to coach a newbie or simply a player that feels like they wanna improve as a new series for my Youtube Channel. How this would work is, basically you send me some clips of you playing some games and I will review them and leave my commentary over the video pointing out potential mistakes, strategies and what is going through my thoughts in a situation like that. 

The reason i decided to do this is because I feel like a lot of people want to get better at the game and this would be a good way to help them. Also people might just find it entertaining to watch, who knows. 

Edit: Alright, so what im thinking is full gameplay from start to end (preferably like 4-3 games) so I can get a good sense of your gamestyle rather than instant death clips. 

Would uploading to YouTube and then sending me the link work for you?",FortNiteBR

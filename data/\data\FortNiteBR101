3,pastyp0rr1dge,1549269025,amzqm1,37,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/amzqm1/bring_back_the_mechanics_from_season_1/,1,Bring back the mechanics from season 1,"So I'm a big fan of epic games. I've been playing footnote since September 2017. Before season 1 so I think it's fair to say that makes my opinion a lot more valid. Here's a list of things I would introduce to fortnite if I could


1. Remove first shot accuracy and drop off.
 Some noob players might think that it's balanced, but I've been playing since September so I know what I'm talking about. Scars don't do enough damage anymore. They're so weak. 97 damage headshots at any range was what made them good and now they're garbage.

 
2. Remove all explosives and anything that implies explosions.
I'm sick and tired of dying to explosions that one shot my builds. Everyone knows that in real life, a poorly constructed wooden wall can withstand a supernova at least. So either nerf them until they're useless or remove them entirely.


3. 200 damage pumps.
Basically I hate getting one pumped, but since I'm  og I should get special treatment. Only I should be allowed to deal damage with pumps while everyone else has to use nothing but grey pistols.
Pumps are overpowered. Speaking of which...


4. Bring back double pump.
Double pump was perfectly balanced and took lots of skill and only I should be able to use it because I'm og. 


5. Remove all smgs. 
They're broken and overpowered. All you have to do is hold down the shoot button.


6. Remove auto aim.
Console players are at a huge advantage. They can just spam ads and get easy wins. If they need so bad, then so should we.


7. Don't bring back any of the item shop skins that I own.
Once again, I'm og so I deserve special treatment. Never bring back any skins that I own because they're rare and I should be the only person who gets to use them. Besides, everyone knows item shop skins are exclusive.


8. Automatically remove any weapon that I die to.
I'm special and og so whenever I die to something, it should instantly be vaulted.

To rectify this I have to take my aim off and re align my shot. I've tried turning aim assist off but that's even worse lol!

After our first game we couldn't even pick squads and had to play ""Showtime"" which seems like fortnite for people who aren't good at fortnite as when you die you just respawn? It said we had to sit in this game for 20 minutes until this ""concert"" started and my boys were telling me that during the concert which lasts like another 15 minutes nobody can shoot and only dance around lol.

They do too much structure and player damage and are more than likely going to be used in the final fights of the match. In my opinion it isn’t fun playing against someone with an rpg and it isn’t fun rpg spamming someone while you’re on high ground and have the circle on you for an easy win, I hate winning like that. I know a lot of people would prefer they only spawn in supply drops or just receive an ammo nerf but I think it would be better if they were only in high explosives or big team modes only. I also know there are people who would say “just build a wall lol it’s easy to counter” but majority of the time a good player with an rpg is gonna spam with you his other weapons too which could be a deagle or ar or whatever. Plus you could be in a fight with more than one player so you’d need all sides covered anyways and RPG’s are simply to good at doing every weapons job. They do huge damage, have a huge explosion radius, have no drop off damage and requires no skill to use or aim. Plus it’s super annoying when you’re solo squadding and someone decides that they can’t beat you normally so they’ll just suicide rpg you knowing that their teammates will be able to revive them and more than likely be carrying the heals to get them back to full health facing pretty much no consequences for their actions.",FortNiteBR

I don't know if that's how daily missions work (there being rarity), but almost every single day I get a Place top 6 in Squads/Place top 12 in Squads/Outlive opponents in Squads. I'm not exaggerating when I say they end up being my daily mission pretty much every single day.

&amp;#x200B;

Right now all 3 of my daily missions are Place top 6/Place top 12/Outlive in Squads. One of them used to be Place top 12, but I replaced it and got outlive opponents in squads. It's ridiculous. I'm always getting squads missions.

&amp;#x200B;

It'd also be nice if a little bit more variety was added. Seeing the same missions over and over is kind of boring, so I think adding some new daily missions would be nice.

At first I was gonna write a short comment but as I read through some of the other comments it just got to me and ended up writing a lot. 

“Honestly I’ve been posting stuff and reading the debate between aim assist and what I’ve learned is that a large majority of pc have never used a controller before to play fortnite. It truly blows me away when I read it’s aimbot and automatically shoots at the head. Honestly if you don’t know enough about something or never tested it out, then shut the fuck up about it. You’re just making it worst and splitting the community. As a controller console player I’m starting to get pissed off about this.

Why I’m getting pissed off because I’m starting to think it’s no longer about aim assist but respect. I’ve got pc bros I play with and hear some pros defending us and do think it’s because pc players numbers largely dominate this game and that’s why you have a lot of know nothing dumbass comments about aim assist. But as of late it’s hard to ignore the feeling that there is a pc master race out there who resent the fact that we are in their game and competing too. The feeling like every success we have is disregarded because of aim assist and a player like Aydan couldn’t be that good without it. 

Let me tell you pc guys why it is that we use controller. It’s because for a lot of us, it’s all we know. A majority of us have only ever played games on console. We didn’t choose between a console and pc for fortnite but it’s because all we had was a Xbox or PS4. I’ve been a console gamer since I was like 8 years old. Using a controller to game is the only thing I know how to use. I’m sure that’s the same experience for a lot of my fellow controller players. 

My opinion is that I always thought that fortnite was a pc game and that the console version was merely an adaption to it. All the OG know what I’m talking about when in the beginning we didn’t even have hotkeys to build and that shit was a struggle. It has since gotten better with the controller but there’s just things we will never be able to do that mnk can. I know in my heart that we will always be at a disadvantage against mnk but that doesn’t stop us from trying to compete. You guys can keep saying shit like aimbot or whatever when you see a controller competing but in my eyes I see a bro who worked his ass off the make it in a pc game. I can promise you that there will be even more controller players in the future who will shake things up and blow up like Aydan. We are here to stay, deal with it.”",FortNiteBR

I grew up on games like Halo 2, COD4, MW2 etc where precision shooting was rewarded and im about at my whits end with the shooting mechanic at this point. I understand the argument that we cant have zero bloom, im perfectly fine with that. But the bloom could be dialed back massively and still preserve the integrity of the game.

In this post , I will go over how this form of matchmaing can be utilised and how it works during different game modes . 

**Solos** 

How it works in solos is  when you ready up , you will have a leage based on your TRN rating in solos and your leaderboard rating . Based on your score , you will be given a rating . The possible ratings you could receive are listed highest to lowest : Rookie , Trooper , Intermediate , Special Forces , Challanger , Titan , Legend . Based on this , there will be a score rating so there will be a match saying , for example :11,000 to 11,500 and you , if you were 11250. Based on how you do , you will be put with higher or lower , so say you came 98th, your next match would be 10900 to 11300. 

**Duos And Squads** 

When you ready up , the average rating of you and our buddy(ies) is found and that is where you are placed . It works the same and goes by the chain is only as strong as its weakest link as the next game's matchmaking depends on the preformance of the player with the least rating .

**Ending Notes** 

This shouldn't work with large team LTM's as that should be normal . Also, there should be a setting and a different server if you don't want ranked matchmaking.

Aim assist doesn’t give you perfect aim it only give you assist hence why it’s called “aim ASSiST, PC players still have a huge advantage compared to console players when it comes to mechanical aim. Aim assist only help at mid-short range and ads spamming really only works well with the Deagle and AK. So don’t say that console players have an advantage cause we don’t, at all. Like seriously do you know how much better aiming is on a mouse then on the right stick? Plus we are limited in our bindings cause you know, controllers. I mean at least pc players have a chance to go above 60 FPS and ya console players are locked there for the most part (even the “pro” and “x” consoles respectively) like it pisses me off whenever I 1v1 a PC player and everytime I kill them they just something like “oh it’s just aim assist” “aim assist” you only beat me cause of aim assist”. Like it’s so dumb cause if that pc player was actually good they would beat me easy because Mouse and Keyboard. Let me list the advantages of KBM vs controller.
__________________________________________________
KBM
Aim is easier. with a mouse therefore aim assist is not needed

Keyboard makes for more customizable and comfortable bindings.

PC players get the ability to up their frame rate to 60+ if they have the hardware.

For most people a keyboard and mouse is easier to use.

There is no advantage simple as that. This might sound a little bit toxic so I warn you to skip ahead if you don’t want your feeling hurt. If your a PC player and you die to a console player then THEY played better than you in that fight. It doesn’t matter if they have aim assist or if they turned it off or if they use a **€¥+*# NES controller. If they kill you they played Better in that fight. Of course the are situations where you might be low health or being 3rd partied but then the guy is smart for waiting for the fight to be over and then pushing. Like I’m sorry man (or woman) but it’s GGS if they kill you. Just cause they play on controller doesn’t mean you can go call aim assist OP. And these pro players calling aim assist OP don’t even know what their talking abt to be honest.(I’m just rambling now I’m going to stop lmfao)",FortNiteBR

TL;DR at the bottom","EPIC - First off, I applaud you for your recent contributions to the Switch version of BR. You have highly optimized the texture pool size and GPU performance on the platform; thus solving the issue with terrible rendering power, streaming performance, and graphics. The game looks better than ever! However, like every other effort of yours in the past of revamping the Switch version of the software, you correct several features, while diminishing several others. 

Don't get me wrong, the Switch is a limited platform. It has a fairly weak graphics card and will never be able to perform as well as other console platforms, however that still does not compensate for the fact that it capped at a reasonable 30 FPS and 1600 X 900 resolution at launch (nothing compared to Xbox and Playstation with 60 FPS). 

The pattern of these Switch optimizations are as follows: like previously mentioned, it ran smooth and graphically adequate at launch, with its ceiling of 30 FPS; it stayed this way until about halfway through season 5, when several content updates degraded it's performance drastically. Textures would not load, graphics would not render, frame-rate would decrease dramatically to a mere 14 FPS at some times, EPIC went as far as ceasing the ability of clipping on the platform. This occurred for several months without any acknowledgement from EPIC, all the way until update version 6.00, or season 6. EPIC finally improved the GPU and CPU, as well as optimizing the texture bindings; graphics were smooth, frame-rate was back to its high of 30, the game felt right again (clipping, however, was, and still is not available).

However, this only lasted, one again, for a few months. EPIC had been going strong up until this past December, when, also once more, a few small content updates decrease performance drastically. You know the drill: graphics fail to render, frame-rate drops, unplayable game, etc. 

This brings us to present day. With the most recent update v7.30, epic has resulted in moving to a more efficient memory allocator. This freed up space on the platform and allowed for, once again, better graphic renders and texture pools. However, that's it. It only freed up space to display a better appearance of the game, it did not improve frame-rate at all, in fact, it's become much, much worse. 

For a game that has a ceiling of 30 FPS on the platform, taking drastic measures to free up space (such as removing clipping, upgrading CPU performance, and switching to a better memory allocator) should not only fix the graphical problems, but the frame-rate problems as well. But is hasn't. The game now runs as it did in its earlier hard times on the system - around a mere 15-20 FPS.

This now brings me to my main point. With recent findings that a low frame-rate results is a faulty aim assist, Switch players have no hope. We are already (supposedly) tacked in at 30 FPS, but that is not the case. If there are too many in-game things going on around you, frame-rate will drop exceedingly (from the atrocity it previously was), resulting in a sheer broken aim assist. It does not work. This also piggy-backs on the disadvantage given to Switch players as they are forced to cross-platform play. 

EPIC, stop this detrimental disadvantage and let us Switch players play each-other on the systems intended, untethered specs.


TL;DR - EPIC's most recent update has improved the graphics and renders on Switch, but diminished the frame-rate. This makes it very unfair to play against forced cross-platforms when aim assist proves to work more inefficiently on lower frame-rates.

Then I think about what COULD have been. Just imagine, If the sword wasn't removed, and we got snowboards like we were supposed to, we would have had sword wielding snowboarders being chased by zombies into dense fog while a plane shoots from the sky and another guy has balloons and is shooting rockets, all while Marshmello plays a concert in pleasant park. Just imagine. It could have been REALLY crazy. It interesting to think about.

Overall I enjoyed season 7 quite a bit. I just started in season 6 when I got my switch. I have 50 solo wins this season, up from only 15 in season 6. I didn't mind planes, I love balloons, the zombies were annoying but I just kind of accepted it as a fact of life. I really wish we had gotten snowboards though. And don't even get me started on the sword. Fun to use for one person, but ruins the game in so many ways. 

Anywho, just wanted to point out to people that it could have been a hell of a lot more chaotic this season. Remember how crazy Polar Peak was when the sword was in play? The castle and all of its loot were still under ice, and it was an all out bedlam in every match. It kind of ruined the lobby because 40 people would drop Polar and the rest of the map was empty, and you would just die to the sword guy eventually. I don't even want to think about the hell it would have been at polar peak with the entire castle thawed, zombies in play, and some maniac(s) with the sword. Polar peak is kind of a quiet place now. It's amazing how much one item can totally change a game. 

Anyway, here's to a good season 7 and an even better season 8. Lets hope for the best. Happy Hunting all.",FortNiteBR

Every time something is causing issue, instead of coming up with creative solutions, they just add a delay/timer. Double pump is an issue? Delay shotgun swaps. The pump pulls out too fast? Add a weapon equip delay. ADS spam is an issue? Add a delay. It makes things slow and sluggish and this will make using a controller feel like crap because it’ll force you to play slower.

Last night was really rough, but today when I woke up I realised that myself and my gf hadn't done the challenges to get the event pickaxe. 

Now I know it's not particularly difficult to do those challenegss regularly but my head is taking an age to process anything just now and I'd only had a half hour to do them for us both. (Its Sunday and she's asleep or we would both play. Plus if I woke her up for that there would be possible backlash!)

Anyway, I had managed it. The first feeling of accomplishing something and it came from a game I love. Honestly this game and this community have been a literal life saverfor me at points. So thanks Epic, Fortnite, Challenges and reddit. You've made a huge difference to my day and had a helpful impact on my life.",FortNiteBR

Mostly when people land houses and search for weapons the TAC is only used if a pump is not found, until then the gun is replaced. This happens for a very specific reason. (Damage drop-off and Range). The TAC shotgun becomes absolutely horrible when a 2 or 3 tile radius. The damage can differ from 23 - 15 damage from a 3 tile radius. This is extremely bad numbers for a shotgun compared to the pump shotgun. Many people may assume fire rate makes up for the damage, but honestly it’s doesn’t. The pump can do up to 110 damage a headshot from a 3 tile radius, while the TAC can’t even average 30 damage. For example, when you’re in a build fight, and you have an open shot you’re not going to be able to do an high amount of damage with the TAC unless you’re extremely close. This is not always the case, and most times the damage on pumps completely out-rule the tacs damage and fire rate anyways. This is why Epic Games should consider giving the tac shotgun some type of buff, until then the TAC shotgun will continue to not be used by most player(s).",FortNiteBR

And of any of you guys say “how much did this really take off dev time” let me list the things

- arranging this
- choosing a location
- creating the stage concept
- creating the stage assets
- putting the assets together to create the stage
- do all that at least 15 times for every unique item in the concert
- create damage disable and ui hide
- bug fixes (there were still a lot, I got locked into build mode for a lot of it and managed to get out by scrolling, random buildings wouldn’t render, and a few more smaller ones)
- optimization (this wasn’t done great if at all, my FPS personally dropped from 120 to about 50
- figure out how to stream that all live

 If you had a gray assault rifle. But your oponent has a gold scar. Whos gonna win?

I believe that all tier 100 skins should at LEAST have the colored styles. After Omega had some color options available in Season 4 it was expected that Ragnarok would have some nice color palettes to make the skin more unique. That was wrong. I also think the Reaper should be updated with some different suit colors and maybe even hair colors to make them unique to those who earned it (and to differentiate from the 100s of thousands that also use The Reaper.) of course, Black Knight should get some love, but it wouldn’t make sense for it to have different color styles because the skin is called a Black Knight. It could have a name change that would permit for a Red or White colored style. What are the community’s thoughts on this?",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is heavily based on RNG (Random Number Generator) Almost all your actions are based on chance. What gun you may get out of a chest. If your bullets it your target. This leads to many unfair advantages.
 If you had a gray assault rifle. But your oponent has a gold scar. Whos gonna win? 
3rd partying is a huge problem. You finish off an openent and someone shoots you down 1 second later. Is it fair that you can get killed from a mile away from someone you couldnt even react too. 
I believe that there should ba reward for kills. Such as instant hp and shield boost. 
In fortnite's current state at best its a casual gane. We shouldnt be hosting tournaments for huge amounts of money for whats basically a casino game. Any thoughts?",FortNiteBR

Here me out, we have the ""Default"" pickaxe but no ""Default"" regular axe? It would be awesome to be able to choose two different Harvesting Tools (1 pickaxe 1 axe) When you would mine a rock or something metal your pickaxe would come out as normal, but when hitting anything wood it should seamlessly switch to your axe! 

We have axes in the game (Fable as an example), and this would alow you to use more of the tools you have no being used currently. 

Personally this is something that has slightly triggered me since I first downloaded the game, just try and pickaxe a tree....the only thing you would get to build with from that is wood chips lol! 

*This obvs is not a nessesary change by any means, I just feel it makes sense, and by being able to use more of the items I have at once the better! :)",FortNiteBR

So, I was playing some Fortnite Mobile while I was out in school during lunch (I'm a Junior), and when some of my friends saw what I was doing, their immediate reaction is ALWAYS something about how Fortnite is complete garbage. In fact, that's how the whole school takes Fortnite. So me and my friends got into a conversation about how Black Ops 4 is way better and how zombies were ripped off of Black Ops in this latest update. I explain that Save the World has existed, and that they just transferred that idea from Save the World, but they don't listen. Also, they say that BO4 is better than Fortnite because you have to pay $60 for it. What the heck? (or that's at least how I interpreted it)

Now, what aggravates me the most about this? *They don't even play the game!* Yep. That's right. Pretty much everyone I know puts Fortnite to shame and they don't even play it.

Also, you may have seen on this subreddit from time to time some meme saying how someone will complain about adding a feature, and when they want the feature added, they don't want it anymore, and when it is gone, they want it again. But look at it this way - Epic Games actually listens to the community and keeps it active. They keep updating the game every week or two to keep the game interesting. There is no one ""overpowered"" weapon, and even when there is, they take it out and rework it so that the game is actually fun again.

But is it just that when something gets popular, everyone starts to hate it? That's how I am seeing it right now.

If anybody has anything to say, feel free to comment. I will try to respond as soon as I can, if needed.",FortNiteBR

I get all the shield consumables in the world and I never run out of health but it’s the materials that’s the problem. I normally farm up 2000 materials early game and then I push kids and get 10 - 19 kill wins. Not a lot of people farm so I normally end the game with a couple hundred materials because after each kill I don’t get a lot of materials back from my enemies. Since the update I never have materials, it seems that people have started to farm less and I often have to spend more materials defending myself from the husks and the players.

I don’t see myself playing the game until the husks are removed and I’m curious to know if anyone feels the same way? If you love the new update and you’re enjoying it more then BR was before husks were added then good for you, it’s just not for me.",FortNiteBR

please for the love of fortnite make solos back to normal without this rubbish.  


Kind Regards

Happy Fortnite player :)",FortNiteBR

I’m Ben, the User Experience Lead at Epic Games. My team helps to research the experience y’all are having when playing our games. The research takes many forms, but there are two methods I would like to talk about today specifically:

&amp;#x200B;

**Surveys**

We regularly send out surveys and we know that folks here are getting them because we see the posts here saying that they are fake and ways for people to steal your data! It is great that you are being cautious, keep that up. But, also keep an eye out for official communications from Epic, that is us and we want to hear from you.

We are also aware that our surveys are sometimes very long. That is because we really want to know what you think and we want honest answers. To be clear, we want the brutal truth. We also ask about a wide range of topics (often across multiple different surveys), some of which may be weird or not seem relevant, but in all cases your feedback is incredibly valuable to us.

To talk about our process a bit more, when we send out surveys we send them to a representative sample. That means that not everyone will get a survey. Don't worry though, over time we try to make sure that everyone gets a chance to give us feedback.

Also when you do get a survey please know that the link you have been provided is handcrafted just for you. That means please don't share the link with anyone else or we will have to exclude your responses from the survey, which sucks for you and us. 

In summary keep and eye out for our valid surveys (stay skeptical folks), let people know a survey is out, tell them to check their inboxes and spam folders, but don't share your link!

&amp;#x200B;

**User Experience Testing**

One of our other approaches is to bring folks that are local to us in North Carolina into our HQ to give us feedback in person. This may involve playing or seeing something that is unreleased or playing the current version and giving feedback on that. 

If you are interested in taking part, and live within 50 miles of Raleigh (sorry, but that is a hard requirement), you can sign up to participate here: [https://www.epicgames.com/ux](https://www.epicgames.com/ux) 

Please also get your family and friends to sign up as well, even if they don't play Fortnite or play games in general. We need a wide range of people and we do compensate people for their time.

If you want to have fun and win a match then go and play an LTM. Leave the Solos, Duos and Squads alone and make Fortnitemares an LTM. I see why EPIC is doing this, to make the game easier and more appealing to NEW players, but almost all of the OLD players dislike the change. Metas such as double shotgun and the peak glitch have been taken out of the game and replaced to new metas in order to help NEW players. They don't dislike it because they win less but because they take it seriously, so leave the zombies and auto-deploy gliders to the LTMs. How can people not see it as ""super sweaty MLG try hard competitive shooter"" when EPIC is spending millions on the competitive scene. While you might be gaining new players with all of the updates and additions you are losing many old players who have spent many hours getting good at a game. Do not focus on new players only, look back at what you were doing right and how you obtained the players in the first place and think ""what can we do to satisfy them as well?"". Allow old players to still have an advantage like building or bring back double shotgun which took skill, to balance out everyone holding down mouse 1 with an SMG. The reason why people complain about not being able to win is because they haven't put alot of time in the game unlike old players. In all quit focusing on getting new players and remember the players who helped grow the game in the first place. I love this game so don't ruin it for me or your giant fan-base of players.

I do enjoy the battle royale genre, but the biggest problem I have with it is the amount of downtime in between fights. PUBG, the Darwin Project, Realm Royale, Fortnite, Nyne, etc - there's always the initial drop fight, a few minutes of running around to a circle/fight, another small fight, a few more minutes of running.... Repeat ad naueseum until the game ends. That downtime between fights is always way too long, and makes the game feel monotonous unless you're lucky enough to get a good drop line and rotation.

With Fortnitemares, though, everything feels far more fast paced, a bit more dynamic. You no longer need to drop in a main location to make sure you've got some equipment - you've got the zambo spawns everywhere that you can use. You're constantly being told where other players are from gunfire and the glowing rocks. Other players aren't your only problem anymore. You're constantly fed a cycle of ammunition and materials from killing zambos, so excessive mat farming isn't a necessity - but that comes with a tradeoff of others finding your position far more easily. You can bait the zambos as distractions to get a better jump on people, etc.

It's taken all of the awkward, 'hold w until something happens' middle ground that's so painful in most battle royale games, and replaced it with a legitimately more dynamic experience. I freakin love it. I know that this is only going to be a short event mode, but seriously - if they came out with an Apocalypse LTM, I would most likely only play that. I feel like it's a complete improvement to the game. Great freaking work, Epic.",FortNiteBR

&amp;nbsp;

We had two different backend issues related to order fulfillments during the Season 6 launch on September 27th.

&amp;nbsp;

One was an instance of our PC / Android payment processing backend running out of memory, which resulted in us taking money, but not granting V-Bucks. We rectified this by refunding additional purchases and granting the purchased V-Bucks.

&amp;nbsp;

The other issue occurred when we deployed an outdated backend that didn’t play well with some changes we made to the PS4 login and authentication flow. This resulted in some players receiving an error when purchasing V-Bucks and delayed fulfillment of that order (e.g. you had to either play a match or log out and in again, etc).

&amp;nbsp;

We resolved the PS4 issue, but didn’t put together that some players might have purchased V-Bucks again after seeing the original error message. This is especially disappointing in light of us making that connection on the PC / Android side.

&amp;nbsp;

Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) reached out to us on the same day, informing us about a spike in customer support requests on their end with regard to the double purchases. We incorrectly responded stating the handling of the PC situation and closed that discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

On October 19th one of our developers came across this thread and internally escalated again. A deeper investigation resulted in us identifying a number of PS4 players that might have inadvertently double purchased V-Bucks.

&amp;nbsp;

We are working with SIE to identify affected players and where necessary SIE will be in touch with players regarding additional information (or instructions) regarding refunds. No action is required from the players impacted, and refunds will not impact V-Bucks balances.

&amp;nbsp;

We are sorry for our poor initial handling of the situation and the delay to rectify it.

Here’s why...,"I’m a player from south east Asia region and I am very disappointed with how epic games is handling the situations they’re facing. 
Epic games is very keen on making the game as fun as possible For the players which is a good thing as this is why the game is still alive but there are a few other things that they should try to focus on like, matchmaking and their networking technologies. 
We all have seen during the skirmish events how the game starts to lag during the end game when there are a lot of players remaining in bounds. Fortnite being a highly competitive game, rewarding hundreds of thousands of dollars to the players during the tournaments should focus more on such basic things. 

I have played this for an entire year on 130ms ping but earlier they introduced the sub regional match making which got us 45ms, it was a really good change to feel. I’ve seen my gameplay improve drastically because of it but with this new Fortnitemares update we are thrown back to 140ms as the sub regional matchmaking fail to withstand the content update and there is a lot of trafficking and I personally wouldn’t  like to play the game ever again on a much higher ping than what I expect for the least. 

This being highly disappointing, I haven’t felt like playing the game for the last 3 days. My friends and I have now decide to move to COD as we are tired of seeing the game disappoint us after each and every update weakly with some or the other bugs and functionality/performance issues. I believe if we friends are doing this there will be thousands of more players doing the same. 

I love Fortnite but looking at how epic is managing things is not acceptable, their aim is to same the game from dying rather than stabilising their game for which they are constantly trying to make changes and I’m afraid there will come the time where the game will die not because of what they’re doing for trying to keep the game alive. 

Peace. ",FortNiteBR

One big thing that a bunch of people are liking is the glider re-deployment. I'd have to agree on this because its adding an extra sense of mobility and gives me that blackout feeling. I play this game to get away from that one. We already have a bunch of mobility items. This also takes away fall damage, now I understand that most people are enjoying this feature, but, I don't think that it was that great of a move. I assume this was a way to get rid of the ""third party"" accusers during large build fights. Both players that are building could now just redeploy their glider as everything is falling down. Now, onto the zombies. This was a good AND bad move by epic. An interesting point some people make about it is, that this game is meant to be enjoyed by everyone, which yes it is. But, there is also a competitive side to it. Having them spawn ALL around the map is a little much. Maybe, keep it down the corrupted area. AS WELL AS having them not spawn in late game. There are a bunch of clips of scrims and it just looks dreadful. Watching people lose and die because of these zombies opening up different spots for different players while they are being shot at from a different spot... Maybe its just me, it was a good idea on paper.. overall, this was one of those updates that was... meh? Not enjoyable, they could of taken so many different routes with kevin and the corrupted areas. ",FortNiteBR

Currently, most people I talk to agree that being able to rotate faster, push aggressively with the glider, etc. is kind of cool and also makes for more dynamic games.

That being said, I think also almost everyone agrees that fall damage is a core mechanic and needs to stay.

Only allowing for  you to re-deploy the glider if you jump firsts fixes a huge part of this problem.

If someone shoots your ramp under your feet for example and you fall, you can't redeploy since you will not have jumped and will then die to fall damage.

If you're a build and it falls, you die.

If you fall off of your OWN build by accident while trying to do a build battle, you die.

A LOT of the current situations where you die to fall damage will still occur.

This means the only time this deploy mechanic is useful is when you purposely jump off of a building/high ground.

I know this probably won't stay in the game, but at least this would be, IMO, a better way to go about it.",FortNiteBR

Not only is it aesthetically much worse imo, it appears to have taken leaps backwards as far as functionality is concerned, too. 


Prior to the update the Epic friends list was distinctly different than the in-game PSN friends menu, and was very accurate from what I could tell regarding who was online and their current status, regardless of whether they were appearing offline via PSN or not. Now, it seems the epic friends list has changed, as this doesn't seem to be the case. 

-Friends are entirely not showing up on Epic or in-game friends list, whereas they clearly are via PSN friends list. These friends can see and invite me, though. 

-invites delayed and sending minutes later

-pressing start and clicking ""Epic friends list"" now brings you to same generic PSN in-game friends list.. not epic friends list.

Fortnite is the only game that I have been playing since last October. Before this update, the game was the most balanced it has ever been.

Here are the ways that Epic can fix the issues created in the newest update.

Problem: Cube monsters
-Cube monsters were a great idea on paper, but they have literally taken over a PvP game, which grew tremendously because of it simplicity.
-You are unable to hear whether you are being pushed by a cube monster or another player.
-Shield and mushrooms might as well be vaulted now that all you need to do is kill monsters to get it.
-It is extremely hard to get a revive off in duos and squads since you have to defend yourself from both monsters and other players (especially when the downed but not out damage changed from 1 tick to 2 ticks per second). This is basically creating a lack of team play.
-Too many cube monsters (especially in final circles)!

Fix: Epic needs to remember that less is more. The game used to be great when it was simple. I see what Epic was trying to do with the addition, but one major fix is to have the monsters only spawn in the corrupted zones. There is no need for them to spawn everywhere on the map. Cube monsters only needed to be a cool small addition instead of taking over the battle royale game mode.

Problem: Glider redeploy
-No more fall damage.
-Too much mobility.
-Running from fights.

Fix: Epic needs to remove glider redeploy!! Fall damage was a very large part of the game. Glider redeployment allows people to build high without fear of dying. Also, there is already too much mobility in the game (Shockwave, Grappler, ATK, Quadcrasher, Shopping Carts, Launchpad, Rift-to-go, Chiller Traps, Rifts, and Shadow Stones). You already have the opportunity to redeploy your glider when using a launchpad, rift-to-go, rift, or the loot lake island. With glider redeployment you are also able to run and hide from fights.

In my opinion, fixing these two major issues would change the game for the better.",FortNiteBR

here is **my opinion** on the topic:
I think this feature effects the game in a bad way on multiple levels.
-In buildfighting you dont need focus on what you are building and how stable the structur is you are standing on. Getting knocked is not a problem anymore since you just can reposition after falling down.
-you losing the build off against your opponent? No Problem anymore since you can just sneakly jump off and repostion somewhere.
-there is no need to waste materials when you go down a hill, you can just jump off an glide towards the fight you just wanted to push... 

this are my three big points i dislike about the new Feature. I think it moves building in a wierd place. In the past it was your own fault if started your biggest build battle only on two ramps, so it was totally reasonable to die in that situation and realize that two ramps are not enogh in a 10+ storyfight...
Honestly i had a lot of fights where i outbuilded my opponet multiple times and when he got low he just jumped away and i needed to follow him to get the loot, which is not a problem if he wasted a jumpad for that move. But having all the time the abbility to make this decision is a bit much in my opinion!

in conclusion i really liked the feature in the 50v50 mode and it gives it a funny and other touch ( not getting knocked down by you own teammates is kinda nice ) but in the normal BR mode its a bit much and game changing.

Let me know what you think about the new Glider Redeploy!

I read the patch notes for 6.20 and honestly thought everything was going to suck. I was pretty bummed out all day. But I realized all the things Epic has been doing lately have been pretty fun and positive changes for the game. Even if things could be better, they've still been pretty good. So I decided to try the patch with an open mind.

&amp;#x200B;

I Have absolutely loved it.

&amp;#x200B;

First, mobility is through the roof now. No slow mid game at all; just non stop fighting if you rotate constantly. Second, RNG (Random Nature Game) is cut way down. If you don't get good loot, kill some zombies. I leave my starting area with all purple and legendaries almost every game now, and full shields are available any time at all. Third, the zombies make so much noise third partying has been cut down. Its hard to hear anything in the distance so you only get third partied by people in the immediate vicinity, no one from a far way off. Fourth, less turtling, because the zombies destroy structures! I would say this patch fixed most of my complaints with the game from prior.

&amp;#x200B;

But there should be way less late game zombies, just saying.",FortNiteBR

When a game is this competitive, there needs to be real balance between guns and counter play and stuff.

There is literally no counterplay to these zombies end game, it’s nearly impossible to heal, or even fight the other dude. Literally no one is farming mats or can farm materials because everyone is fighting the zombies trying to kill them, so everyone end game has like 100 wood, and you’ll be lucky to kill them before they use all of it up anyways.

The glider redeploy doesn’t even need to be tested, it was already a LTM for solos and everyone hated it. It works only well for 50vs50, not actual games.

On top of that, if most people didn’t know which I don’t they do since no one is complaining, **but you literally die 2x as fast when down**

Even if any one of you wants to continue to suck Epic off, this was still a terrible idea to do before a tournament with *millions of dollars involved*

It’s so very obvious they literally don’t care. I joked when the spam meta with drum guns and p90s was a thing that’s someone’s kid at Epic is making all the decisions and now I really don’t know. This update is only more bad changes on top of already bad changes no one asked for.

My stats for reference - https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/buhzaRR

In other words.. I play... A lot. 

For any of you who care, this is my unbiased opinion on the state of the game right now.

**Fortnitemares.**

I enjoy the fog, adds a new element when realistically not taking much away from the overall visual and render distance. 

Now the two most controversial things.. 

**Zombies** - I get the idea. I like it. Halloween, zombies... Name a better duo.. But things need to be reworked with them.
Here's my list. 

Their drops -Too many health items like shields, chugs and medkits spawn from them. In my opinion it should be strictly 5 shield per kill and ammo with light resources. Nothing else. 

Their noise - You can't hear a thing in and around their spawn. Hearing your teammates talk is hard but manageable with setting adjustments but other teams footsteps behind you... Forget about it, they're as silent as bill cosby slipping a pill. 

**Deploying your glider** - This is something I feel very strongly about. It's fun. Really fun. Who doesn't love being able to build as high as they want without fearing a fall to your death? I know Myth does.. The thing is, that's all it is and should be... Fun. When you mix it with a competitive game mode (and yes, normal public games are competitive game modes because they are ranked) it adds an element that should not be there. There's many scenarios I can name on why this should be removed but I strongly believe Epic will see it's not the way to go and remove it themselves... Especially with the shadowstones/max height and glider spam/exploit going on right now. 

Aside from those two things...

Fortnitemares is great, I love the additions to the map, especially the updates in fatal fields. 

My only recommendation is this...

I know Epic is riding a hype train right now and although not as strong as it used to be it's still a big train without any sight of derailment right now.. However, you need to focus on the things that need fixing in the game rather than the new add-ons/items being added to bank money. We still live in a spray meta, we still live in a shotgun being outperformed by pistols close range meta and for god sakes, vault the double barrel.

2. She has no idea what she's talking about so just said what she knows

Either could be valid at this point, so take all of this with a grain of salt. The fact that the items were added yesterday and weren't given to Galaxy owners yet seems odd. Makes me think it'll be part of a new skin set coming (female galaxy) ",FortNiteBR

The obelisk should be kept in normal mode, but only when it meets a certain criteria, (4th-5th circle should start spawning obelisks).

Anyway, what you're going to want to do, is find the menu for your TV, and from here on out it's different for most TV's. It can be under picture, screen, resolution, and so on, and you're gonna want to go through all the options, to see which one fits your TV the best.

hello Reddit,

I live in India and have a fiber internet connection, I have spend over 200$ on this game over multiple accounts. But I am still forced to play on 160 ms ping on Asia servers and Eu servers. On a rare occasion I get to play on 90 ms ping on SEA servers. Post Fortnitemares update those servers have been shut down completely. Now I can't even make myself play this game because I don't like to lose and have 2 Kill/Death.

&amp;#x200B;

On SEA servers I get 90-100/60-70 which is unplayable cause edit menu takes at least an year( 0.1 s ) to load up so I have to force myself to edit slowly. Building sometimes becomes a hassle on 90 ping too but it is decent for the most part.

&amp;#x200B;

Major issues start popping up when I try to do literally anything on JPN servers(150-160 ms). I can't play a single match on that server because of the lag. I will elaborate what I mean by lag:- Can't edit (fast), Missing shots, Player movements are very rough and unnatural and every interactive mechanic in the game is delayed.  I am sorry to say but it makes me wanna quit playing this game.

&amp;#x200B;

So for the time being please try getting us dedicated SEA region. I don't care if Duos, 50 Vs 50, Limited Time Mode on SEA server gets disabled. It will help in increasing the people matching to get into a Solo or a Squad game in the SEA server. Kindly do justice to the players in our region. So that 100% of the matches we load into, we don't have to leave to get a good server.

&amp;#x200B;

Long term, try to get us in India 'Mumbai servers' in playground ( Cause I think we lack the player base to run 100 player lobbies 24x7 ). And I have also noticed a lot of people from South Africa complaining about the ping too, I am not affected by this issue but hopefully you guys at Epic can help them out too.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't deny the fact that I have not had any fun playing this game. But Emotions towards the game are changing, now as I get better at the game I am noticing the fact that my ping is limiting my play style and performance during a match.

&amp;#x200B;

I have ample amount of respect to Epic and the people who helped in the creation of this game and I am not trying to bash anyone. I am just putting this post out there cause this topic deserves more attention as everyone of the 200 friends I have in the region want the same. This may look like a new issue but its not. There are not a lot of us on reddit or twitter cause of the language barrier. But they do have strong opinions about the issue and will be very grateful if they get to play and have fun by playing on a server with a much better ping.

Thank You for reading through the entire thing.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR : -**

**Problems high ping players in SEA face --&gt; Can't edit (fast), Missing shots, Player movements are very rough and unnatural and every interactive mechanic in the game is delayed.**

**Solution to SEA ping --&gt; Get us dedicated SEA region. Disable Duos,50 Vs 50 and Limited Time Modes on that server to concentrate players matching in Solos and Squads ( The most common and essential game mode, I believe ).**

**Solution to IND ping --&gt; Add Mumbai servers to playground since the player base in India cannot make up 100 player lobbies 24x7.**",FortNiteBR

It prevents players from cheaply shooting down your builds from miles away while you're trying to have a build battle with another player(s). They should make this permenant and remove all other mobility items (launch pad, atk, quad).

Horses make camping more difficult yet make building actual *forts* viable, if you build trap tunnels and stuff, and make the endgame alot more intense in a good way. They just make battle royale have much more of a fortnite vibe to it.

Tonight I was excited for the update. Genuinely  thrilled. Zombies that drop loot and no more fall damage?!?! What could be bad about that? Well I wouldn't have minded had it been an LTM. However playing in the tournament mode especially and losing  matches because of the zombies and newfound ability to glide into a third party has changed the game completely. It caters to the unskilled that mop up after fights and leaves aggressive and  skilledplayers aiming for kills(like the tournament mode leans towards) with little to no options left. In the 15 matches I played 4 of them were lost simply because of zombies being so agro we couldn't turtle properly in a fight(that a third party had entered). 4 other matches were lost because a third party team ramped and glided in to clean up what was left of the fight we were in with 200 health on each third party member. Now third partying, because of rifts and other mobility options, has become quite the choice for the not so skilled members of the game. 

Now here is where people argue, ""WeLl yOu HaVe tO hAvE sKiLl To kNoW wHeN tO tHirD pArTY"" and the simple fact is you don't. They are just easy kills that would be far less abundant without so much mobility. This is just my argument against the gliding portion of this update and really any form of accelerated mobility in general. 

As far as the zombies go, this is a battle royal game, not a PvE and PvP combined game. This takes away from the BR concept as you are adding in characters that do damage and simply take away from the PvP aspect. I can honestly say fighting the zombies in general only leads to problems. The first and foremost being you can't hear shit while fighting them leading to an easy third party due to no ability to hear and the reasons listed above. Finally my last example of the zombies being a bad addition is one that happened in tournament mode and it hurts me to repeat. But I went down after a fight in a corrupted zone where zombies were spawning. Due to the pure aggression and amount of zombies that accumulated my partner was unable to revive me leading to a 1 v the rest of the game. Sucks yeah I know. Butt there's no reason something other than other players should force your hand like this if you're making clean and early rotations away from the storm. 

Finally, like j said, I'm trying to be understanding of it all while forming my gripes but the negatives to the gameplay heavily outweigh the positives in my and it seems most other opinions. Personally I don't think I'll pick the game up until it's fixed. Good for those of you that keep playing, I wish the best for ya. As someone who has spent around $2000 on the game it will be hard to put down. But this update really put the salt in my mouth for myself and many other people I know.",FortNiteBR

I've seen countless games get nerfed/patched/metabombed into oblivion, and I've seen games do well. I love shooters and I love Fortnite.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand that some if not all of these changes are most likely not permanent, but there are many changes and lack there-of that are staying around. Why get good at building when you can re-deploy your glider, or get spammed down by one RPG that takes down 3+ walls? The pro meta will  always be different than public play, but even still being forced to adapt to a meta surrounding spam of an assortment of shrapnel rather than rewarding good aim and good builders is ridiculous. The last AR added is less accurate than the SMGs after the second shot, and can't compete with the current scar if you have any brains and can hear on an average level.

But forget all that, lets add a game mode that you *have* to play and create more server lag than already exists. We can have skins and new things that look shiny and are fun for two games, but get old very fast. If you guys want to see pro skirmishes end in 40 person build-offs in the final circle, with every players lagging off their structure then by all means continue this trend. Personally, it's all getting old and I don't see it going on much longer for me.",FortNiteBR

with that out of the way, I'd like to talk about progressive outfits. we've had them for 3 seasons now, and for 2 of those seasons we've been able to finish the outfits outside the season that we earned the base skin. the only exclusion is season 4 with Carbide and Omega who were level-based instead of experience-based.

Many people I’ve seen complain about how they don’t have time to heal or that they have a bunch of zombies attacking them. I don’t understand this as they are actually quite slow and easy to outrun as well as having a relatively short range of attention. Late game, there is now minimal incentive to camp as you are getting attacked by zombies. It’s almost as if epic has wanted to make camping less common (storm movement, mobility items, they even tried the storm breaking structures) this change made the endgame last a lot less because it is better to attack the last team than wait around and get attacked by zombies.

This leads on to the second point:
2. Glider redeployment makes sense, but can be improved

Glider redeployment is a useful mechanic for mobility. Being able to glide from anywhere means you are able to get into the action quickly. Out of all mobility mechanics/items, none of them were available at all times in the game to all players. This gets rid of part of the RNG that everyone seems to hate. Another thing is that this also decreases camping because at any time you can have a guy fly into your base/1x1 and attack you.

The improvement I would make is slightly increase the height needed to deploy the parachute so that you can’t do it as easily and there is a point where you will take fall damage and not be able to glide.

Let me know what you guys think cause it seems like it could possibly be that the majority likes the update but usually you only see the people complaining about it.",FortNiteBR

I couldn’t heal because I had at least 10 zombies on me and the other kid 3rd partied at the very end of my last fight. So I’m building against a scar getting shot at me and at least 10 zombies breaking my walls from all sides. I finally escape the zombies and push the kid. We get into a build battle and he flies away. The zone is relatively small and the kid already built up a little by the time I reach him. I still had these 10 zombies on me and still had no time to heal.

If they were to bring them back though, it really should have been when the update went live, similar to what they did with skull trooper and skull ranger. Although it would have been predictable since they'd already did it once in the past, but it would have been a great way to get people excited.

I’ve seen so many posts on this subreddit complaining about this update. But this entire day I’ve played with my friends and we all like it. The zombies or husks or what you want to call them give you a FREE look into stw. The fact that you can’t decide to play normal doesn’t really matter because you can avoid the zombies all together, or grab some explosives to get rid of them. Speaking of explosives, the pumpkin launcher coming back with the hoards of zombies is perfect. The new gun has good amounts of damage in a short period of time, but when you run out of bullets, you have to switch weapons making it one of the most balanced weapons in the game rn. The deagle buffs are AMAZING hitting that 100 headshot from 200 meters feels so great and if they are going to change anything about this patch please don’t change the deagle. The re-deployment change is what it should have been in the first place so I don’t know why people are complaining about it. I feel like the crossbow could use a buff against players but the damage it does to the zombies is great. The only thing I think this patch actually needs is less zombies late game.

I left after two games and am deciding to not play again until this event is over. Fortnitemares ruined the game for me. I don't want to shoot zombies, If I wanted to I'd play Save The World. The zombies ruin the experience entirely. In my second and last game I got into a build battle which I won only because a zombie boss kept destroying and killing who I was fighting. This is unfair and not fun in the slightest. Sure, it's a good option for people who want a casual experience, but it ruins it for anyone who just wants to play the game and not care about lore or new additions. I wouldn't have a problem with this new update if there was a way to queue into normal games without zombies, but since there isn't I don't have a reason to play the game. Fortnite could have taken a cute or cliche approach to Halloween, but making this event was too much. Sure, make the map foggy, add decorations and jokes, but for the love of god remove the zombies. Farming zombies isn't fun and is just overall tedious, distracting players from farming materials or moving around the map. In my second game when I was top ten, I didn't even realize because a zombie boss had been chasing me. I had to kill it which ended making me die.

Always being able to glide? I know it’s a test but why even test it. It was already a solos ltm everyone thought was aids and it really only worked well in 50vs50. Everyone builds like playground build battles and unlike when we had *bouncers*, when some dipshit decides it’s time for a 6 story resort to be built our only option is to break it down, with doing no damage. Or burn through 300 mats if not more trying to get up.

DBNO time was cut in half..? Why, who even asked for this? Having it at 100 secs was way better than 50secs, 50secs literally is barely enough time for your teammate to clutch up, then get to you without you already being dead or being at like 2hp.

Zombies. We’ve heard enough and seen enough. Either need to be their own **seperate** ltm or literally not spawn everywhere every 5 feet with spawners being easier to destroy. Who even thought this shit was a good idea with twitchcon soon? I cannot wait to see high tier players all just turtling against waves of zombies, until final zone where literally it’s just whoever has the least on them. 

Zone moves faster end game. Again, why? It felt not perfect, but fine before. No one said “yeah fam crank that shit up dawg yee yee”, this just has more people possibly dying to zone. I do like the 8dmg instead of 10 though.

Can we fucking stop with these ridiculous updates that consistently are making usually always the wrong moves?

It does not feel competitive what so ever and the zombies have added more RNG and are unnecessary.

 It would be nice if they could make fortnitemares a separate playlist but i don't see that happening. So this might be a good opportunity to get outside and actually have a social life haha.

It wouldn't be as bad if they kept the fortnitemares modes separate. The husks/zombies or whatever you wanna call them ruin any fight in each solo, duo, and squads. They make far too much noise and you have to give away your position to kill them, also if the ""battle is building"" why are stupid and annoying zombies currently in the game which destroy your buildings and do soooooooo much damage for no reason the fact they legit spawn everywhere is also shocking, I'd at least like to see a change to the HP level of the Totem they spawn from is like 10k. There is so much lag anywhere near then, I feel like I'm playing on a slide show with how un-fluid peoples movements are when I'm fighting them anywhere near the zombies, or even just in the open map. I don't know if it just the servers can't handle all the new things at once, or they are just ""having a bad day"" but since this update nothing has been right.

You can keep double pump nerfed, you can keep 200dmg pump headshots in the grave, you can leave the double barrel in the live game, you can keep bouncers in the vault, you can keep all the good you've taken away.

How is it that half the time when I land in everything is ice cream, yet the devs have time to develop and add the quad launcher, a splode no one asked for.  The devs have time to add STW zombies to the BR game, add the revolver back as a direct rip off of overwatch's McCree after it was just removed, add rocks that TURN YOU INVISIBLE and LET YOU FLY. THERE IS ZERO DIRECTION TO ANY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF FORTNITE IN THE PAST YEAR.  This entire season has felt like an ad campaign for the skull trooper, hiding under the guise of ""halloween fun."" I swear it feels like a 9 year old with ADD is developing this game... ""omg i love flying 50s its so fun we should have deployable gliders in every game mode hehe xd."" it's great that the Dev's try to listen to the community, but when you have literally millions of 9 year olds screaming at you online to change the game in their favour, you eventually have to put your foot down and develop a consistent and competitive game on your own.  How can Epic be earning so many millions of dollars, yet can't give us custom matchmaking, can't give us a rated competitive system, can't give us good servers, can't make up their mind about a single patch decision they've made... at this point I genuinely want to see a stream of the devs playing just to see their skill level at the game, because every patch has been catering to the opinions of new players, and people that don't want to put in effort to be good at the game . /rant",FortNiteBR

Give me a break. You mean to tell me just because someone doesn't like the update, we can't complain? Can't give feedback? This update is straight trash. If I wanted to play zombies I'd go buy COD.

Can we talk about this update for a little bit?

The amount of these monsters that spawn is RIDICULOUS!!! I died late game and came in 2nd place 3 times because of the monsters. I can't even get a heal off?? C'mon Epic. I thought you ""listen to the community""?? WHEN DID WE ASK FOR THIS, LMAO???  Can't farm mats because from the second I land, I have to fight off either sweaty kids or monsters. Real fun, yo... Sign me up!! I've invested so much time and money into this game I should be a shareholder for Christs' sake...and I know I'm not the only one!

I'm not even mad about the glider deployment. It's just easy kills for me when idiots think they can just float away after build battling me for 5 minutes HAHA. Jokes on you fools who try it.

BUT HOWEVER! There are some positives to it. Most of the bots will be so caught up in fighting the monsters, that they're easy to pick off. The D-Eagle needed a buff and finally got it. The end game zone changes are great, keeps people moving.

I will continue to play, and I'll be avoiding the monster spawns as much as possible.  Going to just try and ignore them for now until Epic realizes they need to tone it down a notch.  In my opinion, this is a great LIMITED TIME MODE. NOT meant for the actual game.  That's just me.  There's always going to be 'that guy' who defends everything Epic does like they pay their bills or something.  I'm not that guy.  ",FortNiteBR

Complaints about the redeploy feature, cube monster interference, and other negativity prepared me for the worst. 

After I got back to my room, I jumped right into solos to check out the new features. The first thing I noticed was of course the new skin on the battle bus. The spooky music, the bus, and the fog over the map all came together to give a really cool and spooky atmospheric feel. I haven't been so impressed by the atmosphere since the early seasons.

Besides the spookiness, we got the long awaited deagle buff, and the new six shooter (which has some amazing animations by the way)! We also got unique sound cues for each trap when selected!

So all in all, I think this was a great update. Thanks Epic!

P.S.

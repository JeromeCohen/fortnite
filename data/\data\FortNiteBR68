This causes the down and not out state in Duos and Squads to be almost pointless as you go down and get finished.

Lowering this to around 25 HP I think will give the game a slightly healthier state in the long run as it takes away the urgent need to thirst as soon as a player downs someone else.

And the people who are just gonna tell us to switch to PC just STFU this post is not for you. It used to be bad before but nowadays even if we just turn we can feel the fps drop. I literally played solo squads today morning killed two squads and when I am about to kill the one last guy in the third squad my ping goes to like 100 and my fps drops harder than my grades and I die. The servers for fortnite are also literally garbage it's so unstable (I have half giga bit internet and play wired) when I play in my Asian servers it says 24 ping but it feels like 300 builds just fuck up each other and stuff. I feel like the entire ping thing is fake and they just added the ping fix in the recent update and I feel like it's just fake ping to keep the player base calm. Don't care if you agree or not.

The reload time is so slow, by the time you shoot someone's wall down, by the time you're done reloading, they've already rebuilt the wall and then some. It's balanced with the damage, getting hit by the shot is like getting hit with a truck, but if it's not a headshot you can probably heal back and run away, and the person would still be reloading.

TL;DR Heavy Sniper has a really slow reload time and it's pretty fairly balanced.

Not everyone plays the game to team(as it‚Äôs against the rules)and some people actually shoot you when you‚Äôre playing a shooting game.

-Building isn‚Äôt sweaty. Doing 90s after a victory isn‚Äôt sweaty. It‚Äôs for fun since, what do you know, people have fun while building.

-Stop saying people build the ‚ÄúTaj Mahal‚Äù. A 3 layer ramp rush is considered a Taj Mahal, when it‚Äôs actually just protecting yourself better.

-Stop defending broken items/weapons. The ball may be fun in pubs, but it‚Äôs an absolute nightmare in any sort of competetive play. The planes and the sword might have been fun, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre balanced.

-Stop attacking things that are balanced. Building and double pump(was)for example. Building is balanced ATM, we don‚Äôt need an LTM without building or any nerfs. Double pump was slightly balanced, it just looked op when you killed someone who was AFK quickly, as anything would look like. Anything looks OP when killing bots with it.

Take the ball for example again, it‚Äôs fun in pubs, but terrible in comp. That doesn‚Äôt mean when Poach complains that he hates balls in general and wants them removed from every playlist.

When I play usually at one point or another a gun will instant kill me cause the guy using it is that good, maybe it's an smg or assualt rifle but more often than not I can react and have a fight I still lose but it's fun can it at least feels like it's my mistake for not building better or shooting better etc.  


I don't really feel that with shotguns, shotguns for one deal so much damage I had 100 health and 75 shield last match and instantly died.. no second chance no way to react just dead and this has been more and more matches. It's been made a bit worse on console with the auto aim, when someone plays on console by default their aim is puled towards a target, combine this with the second aim assist that snaps your aim to any target close by when ya zoom in not many weapons can compete.  


So can we get something anything to mitigate this one shot there are a few items that can help but they never spawn as commonly as shotguns.

However, I don‚Äôt think Epic is planning on vaulting it any time soon since it‚Äôs more of a new-player friendly gun. If they unvaulted the heavy, I think we could allow a new playstyle to make the tac and also the heavy picked up more(since it was vaulted because of how underused it was).It would be heavy-tac.

Essentially removing the circle delay when switching ONLY from a heavy to the tac.

Some people argue that pump-tac is OP, and the reason for it is because the pump can hit for 200+. However, the heavy can‚Äôt, making it more balanced. And don‚Äôt forget it only has 77 body compared to the pumps 100+.

I think this would allow for a new playstyle, which has been needed, since for almost 5 seasons pump-smg has been the reigning meta. It would also make the game a lot more fun and fresh. Season 8 could be a new turnaround for the game.

I'm not saying there shouldn't be a ranked mode, that's completely fine, but balancing the game around competitive is the way this game would die.

Let's look at (in my opinion) the best FPS every made. Team Fortress 2. This is the ultimate game to look at for balancing. They always fix OP weapons (even if it takes 1 and 3/4 years) most overpowered weapons get fixed, and mostly they become what they should be. Sidegrades to default weapons.

TF2 also has a rudimentary Comp mode. TF2 is one of the highest skill ceiling games, and has led to a lot of community comp modes. Valves tries not to restrict anything, but in that has created a massive unbalance. This is where I believe things could've gone wrong.

There's nothing wrong with nerfing things strong in comp, but ruining that casual feeling is what I'm afraid of. Let's bring this back to Fortnite.

There's nothing wrong with the removal of the plane, it was very strong and continuously trying to fix it led to it's eventual vault. There were a LOT of players who hated it (me included) but there's also a lot of players who loved it, the silent minority.

They lost something they loved, which is what I'm afraid of. There's now the Baller (I'm planning to make a breakdown on it, give me some time) which is pretty overpowered in high level gameplay, but with the mentality of the 1%, it would be nerfed hard enough that it would probably lose it's fun value.

I'm under the belief this game needs to stay casual, I'm not the biggest fan of the Shotgun meta, but it was better then the spray meta.

Let's look at Season 4, at the end, shotguns were decent, the SMGs were still very strong, Dualies were a fun sidegrade, and there were more options.

Now, you MUST run Shotgun, SMG, AR, Splode/Utility and usually one med if you want to have a chance against good players. It's something I really don't enjoy, and I want more variety. I love the Baller, it's quick, fun and unique.

If we keep on the nerf/vault mentality that most competitive players have, I'm worried this game will lose it's spark.

The only solution I could think of is to have two different versions of the game, pubs with all the fun items and Ranked with non of that, but that can get really annoying to keep track of for most players.

This went on way longer then I had hoped, so I'm going to wrap it up by saying

If we make this game to competitive, it's going to get stale and unfun to play especially with all the good players around, causing casuals to quit everyday, we NEED variety to keep this game alive, and forcing the game into being a competitive powerhouse will cause a majority to quit, then who's left?

I think I had more to say, but I can't remember, so I'm leaving this here. I'll edit if I have more to say. What do you guys think, try to keep it civil, and not devolve into Sweats vs Bots.",FortNiteBR

I'm honestly getting tired of every single ltm being squads or duos. I'm a solos only player who only dare touches squads for daily challenges and just goes afk to complete them. And despite having like 20 or 30 friends, none of them even like playing with me because I'm a casual and nothing else and I'm. that typical guy who dies to a sweaty ttv every game and my only hope is solos.

I know that playing with friends is one of the most fun and awesome things you can do in any videogame, but Epic *HAS* to understand some people don't really have an opportunity to play with friends for various reasons.
Solos ltms are still fun for everyone. They're different from the main modes and provide variety, but they're very rare. Everything is squads now, I don't think I've seen a solos ltm in season 8 yet, and that's unfortunate, isn't it? 

Even if I play with randoms I still always get some dumb kids who always drop tilted WITH RANDOMS, who are people you don't even know if they're pros or potatoes, and then they die immediately cause they didn't get a gun or they got one pumped. 
And I dont even want to attempt solo squads, never happening, just no. 

How hard is it to even put a solos ltm. It's so easy, but Epic won't do it. It's frustrating only having solos and big team modes to play, the same old gamemodes and no variety. Ltms are refreshing and keep players entertained and not get bored of the same thing, but if you got no friends, no variety for you. ",FortNiteBR

When I asked him what‚Äôs wrong he replied, ‚Äúeveryone hates me, even an adult just called me a bad word.‚Äù When I asked him what word it was he replied saying that the adult called him a little f*ck and that it had happened multiple times before to him. 

He was also getting bullied by the other kids in my lobby because he had only started playing in Season 7 and this, plus the previous mentioned story, broke my heart. To hear this little kid so visibly upset made me realise that people really need to pull their finger out.

I‚Äôve read a few posts and comments (mostly comments), and my god are some of you annoying, ignorant, and/or stupid.

One of the things that people are complaining about is that players are building too much so they are sweaty tryhards

I don‚Äôt know if you guys have been playing recently, but there are ALOT of good players. If you don‚Äôt build immediately after getting shot and trying to get high ground, there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre going to get s**t on. Also, why are people complaining about this? If you don‚Äôt wanna build battle that high up then don‚Äôt. You can always break it down. Instead of carrying around a sniper that you‚Äôre probably never going to land a shot with, then try carrying some explosives. 

What do you guys think?, I‚Äôm curious.

-the first cat pet
-a revamped pet ‚Äòstand‚Äô that has a more personality than battlepass pets that are simply just backpacks with cushioned cut outs for the pet to sit in

It‚Äôs such a petty thing to be upset about saying that it cost more more than the battle pass when we buy rare quality skins for a high price. Now if it was another dog with the same style stand as other pets, I‚Äôd be upset, but Empress brings a fresh unique model for us :)

It comes as a surprise to me because in no other game have I seen so much hate and toxicity towards players for being good.  I get that it's hard for casuals to compete in an ever-so increasing environment, but pinning players who've put in time and dedication to get good as the problem is doing no good for anyone.

The common theme I've discovered is that some members of this sub view good players as people who don't enjoy the game; I ask you:  what makes you think that just because we are good and want to win we can't be having fun?  Entertainment is subjective to each player.  Some enjoy messing around in playground with friends; others enjoy build battles.  Some enjoy exploring the map and testing out the new guns; others enjoy going for high-kill games.  Some enjoy doing challenges; others enjoy fighting for Victory Royales and leaderboard spots.  What I'm getting at is everyone plays this game differently, and hating on someone for their style is a terrible justification.

Fortnite is a silly, creative, and easily-accessable game capable of satisfying everyone's game style, but in the end, it's a shooting game that, with the ability to build, has an extremely high skill game.  The end goal for many players is to be the last man alive, and they're willing to do whatever it takes to win.  Don't expect a better player to not use their skills and try to kill you; afterall, if they are capable of finding and executing ways to kill you, what makes you morally superior that you shouldn't die?  You can shoot back, correct?

Overall, using the excusd that someone is better than you as a way to hate on them is stupid.  If ""sweating"" is fun to them, who are you impede on that fun?  Just because we don't enjoy doing the conga all match and would rather go for kills and then win doesn't mean we aren't having fun.

It‚Äôs just hilarious how the majority of this sub think that a 4 second reload time makes it okay that a gun can do 150 body shot damage from a distance. Imagine if I see an enemy walking around, he doesn‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm behind him. I can just line up a shot and hit his body pretty easily, if he has 150 hp he‚Äôs dead without even reacting. 

Also, the bullet drop of snipers is pretty low right now. This makes it pretty easy to hit (body) shots and it doesn‚Äôt really reward a ‚Äòlot‚Äô of skill. Sure you need to be a bit skilled to hit your shots but I think the skill gap isn‚Äôt that high for using the sniper.

Heavy snipers should do less body shot damage",FortNiteBR

Platinum would have the same abilites as an employee, including recieving all cosmetics+ recieving cosmetics up to a week early. Gold, would have these, while omitting the ability to system-ban players, and would get all battle pass cometics. Gold would omit the ability to perma-ban players and would only get early skins, while being able to buy skins at a significantly reduced price. Silver would be able to issue warnings and mark suspicious and rude players for review. Bronze would get the early skins and player tagging.

B: No 

r/fortniteBR: You seriously don't see the problem in the game rn? Fucking sweat...

-------------
Question 2: Alright so what are your opinions about a ranking system? 

r/FortniteBR: We NEEEEEEEEEEEEEED SBMM in EVERY game. 

Also r/FortniteBR: No we need one permanent ranked mode to divide players into different groups based on skill when they want to! SBMM would just turn the game into a grind fest! 

r/FortniteBR: bUt RoCKeT LeAGuE DoES iT! 

Also r/FortniteBR: But Rocket League doesn't have the concept of third partying, nor does it deal with more than 6 players at a time. Furthermore the goal and practice are almost always the same. 


r/FortniteBR: well a ranked mode would still put casuals against pros in normal games, so thats not an answer either. 


--------- 
Question 3:
Why is the game a ball ache for casuals now, but not before in seasons 5-7 when the game was plenty old, but for some reason pros were not as common. 


r/FortniteBR: .... 

-------- 
Question 4: 
Ok... What did pros not like about season 7? 

r/FortniteBR: FERKEN PLANES! 


------- 
Question 5:
Why were planes not well liked by players? 

r/FortniteBR: People can just hide up in planes all game and camp, then divebomb you! They require no skill to use! 

-----
Question 6: But this skill gap virtually didn't exist while the game was in this ""unbalanced"" state? 

r/FortniteBR: NO! IT WAS THERE! Noobs just used planes and didn't have to fight properly.

--------
Question 7: 
But noobs enjoyed that gameplay much more than they do now.... Right? 

r/FortniteBR: ....


------- 
Question 8: 
It almost seems like an overpowered tool or weapon may unbalance the game logically, but in doing so gives a foothold to players who can't play every day to compete with people who play hourly, making the game somewhat more of a battle royale and less of a constant grind against the same battles, and genuinely more fun (albeit slightly more annoying) for everyone involved.

The hamster balls are probably the best vehicule released yet, they are so much fun to use and great to move around the map. However, regarding competitive games like the gauntlet cups, I strongly believe they should be removed from the playlist, endgames are just people rolling around in balls doing nothing and literally teaming with other players in balls. It's basically the same issue that happened in winter royale with planes but worse because you are basically immune in the ball.

Before anyone tells me ""why don't you just shoot the balls"", its because in end games wasting your ammo and peaking for too long will make other players focus you and laser you",FortNiteBR

If I'm being honest, I would say I'm for sure far above average in this game. I know all the building techniques, I've mastered multiple versions of 90's with some being faster with less support and others being a bit slower but with more support, and I'm pretty quick with my edits. Regardless, I honestly believe that Epic needs to consider doing something about the building in this game. Now, I'm not suggesting a huge nerf because at the end of the day building is what creates the massive skill gap in this game and helps it stay competitive and consistent. However, I truly believe that it would help the game if it was tweaked a little bit. I think there's far too much emphasis on building which leads to awkward 2 to sometimes 4 minute build fights where a gun is shot maybe only a couple times within that time span even though it could end in less than a minute if there was more emphasis on gunplay. I have a lot of little suggestions for how to fix the building but I was just wondering if other people agree with me or if they like the game fine the way it is currently. Also, let's keep this post mature and act like adults upon the matter... I'm just looking for a simple discussion. ",FortNiteBR

10 gliders should NOT be part of the loot. Don't tell me it's in case someone accidentally loses theirs and wants them back. If that happens, screw that person, not literally everyone else who ever plays the mode.

this is some simple ass decision to make, honestly. No gliders in loot on modes with 50 gliders to start. God damn. I should work for epic. ",FortNiteBR

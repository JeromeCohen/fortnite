I think Epic should give players that were from season a second chance by letting them buy one non-seasonal skin (ex: Renegade Raider) of their choice. Although some will say this will make old skins less rare I disagree because not many people played in season 1.,FortNiteBR

Then we decide to play the Steady Storm LTM and fill with other players forgetting that mobile and pc players using fill does not actually work. We enter a game, and while I'm loading I hear a clicky keyboard thinking okay, well there's probably just a guy in our game with voice chat on, but when I loaded in there was no guy to be found. My friend could not hear him at all throughout the entire game and only I could hear his keyboard sounds. Start to end I could hear his keyboard like he was playing a regular Fortnite match. I died and my friend was still questing what I was hearing, no background video, not logged into twitch, all windows of Microsoft Edge closed and was still able to hear his keyboard. I decided it was time to pull out notepad a little suspicious to what would happen, I typed ""Hello?"" in notepad and all of the sudden right after I typed that message I heard a young boy say ""Oh no"" I then told my friend I would restart my computer and after that I never heard from him again.

Why do people make it seem that shotguns are complete ass?
Almost everybody wants to have a shotgun in their kit, they are still the kings of close range combat, you just cant spam with them like you used to, it's way more healthy to the game when people switch to a smg after firing a shot from their shotgun, IMO.
There are some specific weapons that are a bit too strong i agree...FE the tommygun should receive a nerf. Also i feel like the AR's need some kind of buff, the reason they are not used is because they are very unreliable(bloom) not because everything else is op. But they cant completely remove bloom else AR's would be op med-long range.
But the rest of the smg's seem completely fine, you can do over 150 dmg with a shot gun close range, there is no way you can lazer somebody with a smg that fast.

Instead the mechanics of building should become dynamic to give both guns their purpose, such as through build fatigue.","Balancing two weapons for the same scenario through their firepower will only make one stronger than the other. In order to make both close-range weapons viable in a build battle it needs to be dynamic so that both weapons have a purpose. 


An example of this is build fatigue, the more you build the lower the starting HP of your walls and the slower they build. This means that at the start of the fight a shotgun push is viable and build battles are still possible. However if the fight becomes extended to the point of who has more resources then building becomes weaker allowing for high fire rate weapons to be more effective over shotguns.",FortNiteBR

I don't see a whole lot of people who use a keyboard and mouse on console, or at least obviously do so. I have mixed feelings about Epic's upcoming matchmaking tech regarding this, and I feel a great way to deal with it is go ahead with what they're doing, but also allow there to be an option for controller users to go ahead and be mixed in with KB+M users for the same experience they've had since day 1. Kind of like how console and mobile players can opt-in to playing with PC lobbies. I just want it to be known that I'm not complaining about this change, but that I'm just speaking my mind.

For me personally, when I switched from the standard PS4 headset to a legit gaming headset, that was the single biggest difference that any single piece of equipment has made on my gameplay.  And it’s not even close.  I’ve played on normal PS4, PS4 Pro, with a gaming monitor, with a 4K big screen tv, and yes, I’ll go ahead and admit it, also w a kbm on console.  But the headset made BY FAR the biggest difference.  And it was immediate, with zero adjustment period or downside. 



Maybe I just suck w kbm (spoiler - I do) because I’ve always been a console gamer and never really played any games on PC, but when I tried kbm on my PS4 to see what the hype was all about I thought it was hard as all hell.   I was terrible.  Way way way worse than w the standard PS4 controller.  I tried it for a bit and then scrapped it bc it was so much harder for me.  



But when I switched to the gaming headset?   Instantly improved my gameplay in a material way.  No downside.  No adjustments.  All positives w no negatives.  I only bought the headset for Fortnite, specifically because I was told it would be a major advantage.  And it is.  Does that make it wrong or mean that I should be in a different lobby than someone who doesn’t have a headset or has the standard PS headset?



If not, then why should kbm be separated on console if we aren’t separating people based on headsets?   What about someone who just plugs in a standard kbm versus someone who buys the high end gaming ones?  Or any number of other things that make a difference in gameplay?



TLDR - I know the downvotes are coming, but I can’t resist posting this anyway.  Tell me why I’m wrong - a good gaming headset compared to no headset or the standard PS headset is a bigger difference maker than kbm on console is.  Tell me why separating players based on kbm is appropriate but separating them based on headset isn’t.  ",FortNiteBR

So based on the new datamined Week 5 and 6 loading screens, it is pretty clear that Brite Bomber and Drift have a thing going on  *( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°),* so here's a theory about the upcoming weeks.

Here's a rundown of what has happened so far.

1. Drift is teleported into the world of Fortnite where he is found by multiple characters, the first of them is Brite Bomber. 
2. They jump onto an ATK and show Drift the world, again with Brite Bomber accompanying Drift.
3. They have fun at the racetrack, again with Brite Bomber being the center-focus of the shot.
4. They are seen at the pool having a party. Drift finally gets the mask.
5. Drift and Brite Bomber are obviously getting along quite well, seen both ""rawring"" in front of the dinosaur
6. They both sit and watch a movie, surrounded by obvious couples. (We know this because of the Leviathan and Ramirez sitting in the front, a callback to the Week One loading screen from S4). This could be where they get into a relationship (or at least become closer friends). Drift is seen without his mask, and visibly uncomfortable, maybe knowing something bad is to come?  (Roadtrip skin?)

Now my theory of what will happen in the 7th and 8th loading screen is that the crack will open up completely in the sky and drop the Roadtrip skin. In the process, it will also allow a way for Drift to get home, which will create a difficult choice.

Drift could either leave the Fortnite world, or stay with Brite Bomber and his friends.

Obviously, the Drift skin has to stay in-game, so we know what choice he's going to make. 

The last, 8th secret loading screen could be him hugging Brite Bomber as the rift closes, or it could be in the animation for Season 6.

Another option would be that he chooses to stay, and then they defeat the new Roadtrip skin. (Or maybe befriend the skin)

A **huge** ""Thank You"" to the people who read this entire thing through. It took me a while to think of this. **c:**

TLDR; In the final weeks, the crack will open up completely and Drift will have to choose whether to stay or leave the Fortnite world. He chooses to stay with Brite Bomber and his friends and (possibly) defeat the Roadtrip skin.",FortNiteBR

I landed far from everyone, typically went into one building, grabbed any healing items I could find, and then hid in a bush, moving to new bushes when the circle closed in.  When I couldn't find a bush, such as at the very end, I would hide under some stairs or wherever I could.

I never built anything or fired a shot, and I don't know the map.

Out of my 5 matches, I came in 2nd twice, 3rd once, 9th place once, and 18th place once.

If I were experienced and put some effort into the game, I could have actually started fighting once I got to the end and would be able to win lots of matches.

Meanwhile, people who run around shooting each other are rarely going to make it to the end easily as I did.

Either I'm just an amazingly good bush camper, or else this is the best possible strategy.

I did put a lot of effort into my hiding and bush camping and fight avoidance.  For example, at the end when the circle was getting small and there were not many people left, I would wait until 2 people were fighting, and only then make my run to a new hiding spot that would still be in the circle.  This works pretty well, as people ignore the person with the pickaxe running away when someone else is building and shooting at them.

I am sure that most of you guys are rather unhappy with the current state of the game or at least find it less enjoyable than it used to be. Many players are hating on the spam meta, the weak state of buildings etc. Most of those complaints are due to one major factor: Not enough (quantity) meaningful (quality) mechanics in the game to improve on or in short: Few ways to CREATE A SKILL GAP.

In every Esports worthy title there are many aspects you can improve on (in League of Legends that would f.e. be CS´ing, map awareness, ganking, etc.). Improving in one aspect means you get better, you get skilled, you create a Skill Gap to someone that does not improve. Being able to improve in many different aspects means you create an even greater Skill Gap. What aspects to exist in Fortnite?

There are mechanical aspects (micro):

\- Aiming: You can train your tracking and your flick shots as well as juggling between different targets quickly and precisely etc.

\- Building: You can train how you open up on someone that pushes you, how you push, how you track people in the middle of a build fight, how you maintain high ground, how you drop safely, etc.

\- etc. 

There are game knowledge related/tactical aspects (macro):

\- Rotations: Where to go for a certain out come, be it high kills, surviving at any cost, getting a lot of a certain material, etc.

\- Different traits for different materials (f.e. metal highest maximum health)

\- etc.

What I gave you here is a couple examples of different aspects that create a Skill Gap. Let me give you an example of something that DECREASES the Skill Gap but adds ""DIVERSITY"":

The newly added Shotgun has no use apart from the situation where you are actually in the face of someone and can shoot him point blank without him shooting you. Realistically that happens when someone does the infamous W-left click in the current meta without building at all while you are in your 1x1. In any other situation it is more reliable to hit a headshot with the heavy shotgun (or blue pump) and immediately build if the target did not die. You do not risk to get shot as well and die or lose to a third party because you did not have enough health. Additionally the cross hair is so big that you can hardly miss point blank.

This leads to the inevitable fact that this gun might be fun short-term simply for the fact that it is a new weapon, but it adds no Skill Gap, it rather decreases it. It enables players that have not improved in certain aspects (building, aim) relatively to you to have a higher chance of killing someone (or severely damaging).

The complaints about the spray meta, buildings being weaker etc. can all be tracked back to one core issue that many people do not really realize: The lack of aspects to improve on by which you diversify yourself from others and create a Skill Gap in your own right. 

How to fix that issue? There are many ways to do that and it is up to the developers to come up with something. Let me throw in a couple examples in a sterile environment just to make you understand the point: 

\- Damage multipliers for each weapon for different materials (SMG shredding wood, AR shredding brick f.e.)

\- More reliable shooting mechanics (Dual Pistols being a severe negative example)

\- Getting more materials by hitting every box when chopping

\- etc.

 I wrote this post in the hopes of having an impact on the future of the game. I myself will be taking a break this patch because I cannot take it anymore (let´s go MHW), but my wish is for this game to make me smile once again and admire people that OUTPLAY me. Not make me tilt, rage, being salty and hating on RNG.

A big thank you to everyone who took the time to read this!

tl;dr:

Not enough ways to create a Skill Gap. Severely needed to make people feel proud about outplays and humble when getting outplayed rather than salty and toxic. Existent in the prominent Esports already and the reason LoL stayed at the top for so long and Sc2 is still being played. Fortnite will bleed players over the next months if nothing is being done.

Epic Games rather listens to the Reddit Minority (Yes reddit is a minority of the players) and tweak their game around the whining reddit tryhards. This way the casual players will soon go back to a simple Call of Duty game which doesn't change its gameplay every week to adjust to the needs of the reddit minority. Example: Mouse and Keyboard on consoles. This subreddit is being SPAMMED with people whining about Mouse and Keyboard. I as a reasonable human being can think of a few things: Mouse and Keyboard isn't the problem of you losing your game it is either your skill or low IQ. If you have a high fortnite IQ you can win almost every battle you're in (except if the RNG is really stacked against you) no matter if your playing with a controller or mouse and keyboard.

I myself have been playing the game less and less this season due to it simply not being much fun anymore. Battle for Azeroth is coming out on the 14th of this month and I was going to skip it completely as I was having a lot of fun with Fortnite, however with the current state of the game I have decided to buy BFA and dedicate my time to that instead. Don't be mistaken, this thread isn't to shoot down Fortnite and say how much of a great game wow is, instead it's to point out people won't blindly follow Epics decisions and will play other games if they lose interest. Epic please don't ruin your game further and give people a reason to leave. If I'm not mistaken a similar thing happened before with Paragon and we all know what happened to that.

TLDR: Other titles are being released in the current months and will leave Fortnite if you don't give them a reason to stay.

I started playing Fortnite back in S3 and spent all of my time in 50v50 and squads, never solos. I have only managed a couple of squad wins because my friends carried me. I was completely fine with this because I didn't want to put in the time and effort it takes to git gud.

However, over the last few weeks, I have begun to experience more success. My favorite gun is the drum gun, and I collect as many of these as possible. My favorite way to eliminate opponents is to keep shooting at them until they run out of materials. I am really good with the minigun and rocket launcher. If an opponent ramps up toward me, I just shoot them down. I'm not a good builder, so I choose not to build. This allows me to focus on my strengths. I gained the courage to play a few games in solos and managed to win a game!  If I keep it up, I think I might be able to have a successful Twitch stream. Does anyone have tips for me?

#veterans 
I'v invested a lot of time and effort into mastering this skill..so why is a day one noob able to counter it so effectively? I'm supposed to be in the top tier of players, yet i'll have to struggle to beat the average or new player.

#noob
As a new player, i want to be able to join a game and have fun, and not get destroyed by a cosmic architect wielding a magic scar #jack 😘 . i'm less likely to keep playing.
The veterans will eventually slowly get bored and play less, and if there isnt an influx of new players to replace them, the game will likely die.

Now as a developer you really dont want your game to die..so its more advisable to be on the side of the noobs and help them.
 Solution? At first thought, skill based match making. The veterans can sweat it out in thier lobbies while the scrubs have fun in thiers. The problem is, the noobs arent going to get better if they keep playing with other noobs. The veterans are going to have extremely sweaty lobbies that just arent very fun, at the end of the day its a video game the goal is to have fun.

So what do you guys think should b the solution. Not just in fortnite, but in games in general that come accros this problem?",FortNiteBR

# Ragnarok LTM

*Description:* Stop the Ragnarok in a 99v1 Battle! Work as a team to avoid the world destruction.

## Rules:

* Normal Battle Royale game until someone gets the Ragnarok's Skull.
* The player who gets the artifact becames the Ragnarok in a 99v1.
* The skull, unlike thanos gauntlet emerges from the ground, making noises so others can get.
* Players near the skull will get a proximity meter to get the skull.
* Ragnarok must kill everyone to win OR fill Ragnarok Meter
* Players need to stop the Ragnarok Event by surviving most time.
* Every player knows the location of others, Ragnarok can't see survivors on the map, survivors can see Ragnarok on map if he gets damaged for a small period.

## How it Works:

* The casual battle happens until someone gets the artifact, playing a cutscene to everyone, the location of where Ragnarok was will be shown for 15 seconds and a 15 minutes timer will be shown, if it gets to 0, Ragnarok loses. The main objective of Ragnarok is cause the Ragnarok (End of the World), to do that, Ragnarok must kill to fill the bar or it will rise slowy, killing will progress in the bar slowy, he can't die, shooting him just makes the bar go slower for a time and decrease his attack to 35% every 50 Damage received and resets on 5 seconds

Ragnarok Skull spawns randomly, someone need to get it then the game turn to a 99v1 where Ragnarok is invincible but there's a timer, fill the bar before the time to win, bar gets filled with kills

## Attacks:

Ragnarok deal less damage than Thanos.

* Frost Scythe: Deals 50 Damage and makes Ragnarok go further to reach players, can destroy buildings
* Frost Beam: Uses both hands to make a Frost Beam, which will damage players and buildings.
* Cold Jump: Makes a diagonal jump travelling 3 Floors (not charged) 6 Floors (50% Charged) and 15 Floors (100% Charged) with a cooldown of 15 seconds

## Map:

The map is the same, but it changes based on the Ragnarok's bar fill,

0% - Nothing.

10% - Storm clouds are forming on the sky and darkens a part of the map based on the percentage(If the percentage is at 50%, half of the map will be dark).

20% - Weak wind on the map making trees and grass moving like as if it was on the storm,sky turns a little dark red.

40% - Medium wind on the map with lightnings and a medium dark red sky.

60% - Strong Wind on the map with a dark red sky and double the lightnings.

80% - Meteors falling, dark red sky, strong wind and lightnings.

100% - Ragnarok wins.

## Ending:

If Ragnarok fills the meter, a cutscene will play to everyone of Ragnarok's triumph, with a island freezing with vikings banners.

If the survivors keep Ragnarok from not filling the bar for 15 minutes, Ragnarok will be teleported to a rift and disappear.

## Explanations:

Ragnarok is in the nordic mythology the end of the world.

Ragnarok can win by filling the meter, survivors must slow the process carefully, if there are enough survivors, they can save someone weakening and slowing the bar, while also revealing his position.

Ragnarok is bigger than the skin.

If anyone on the game haves Ragnarok with stage 4 or 5 it will be shown as stage 3, players with stage 1,2 and 3 remain the same.",FortNiteBR

I’m here to talk about the recent patch.

Okay so the new shotgun is.... eh. You literally need to be at EXTREME close range to get a shot in for over 100 damage. That’s terrible considering it comes in epic and legendary rarity. Now, playing with this gun is amazing. It feels so fresh to play with shotguns and blast people again. It actually feels rewarding to hit your shots instead of holding down the trigger and waiting for the “Eliminated Player252” to come up. This is why we need epic to let shotguns back into the meta. Smgs don’t have to be nerfed to hell, just leave them at the same or maybe a little lower level than shotguns.

The double barrel is not an ideal weapon to take though. No shotgun is right now. Every single shotgun needs a buff, especially the double barrel and heavy. Epic is now scared to make a powerful gun because of everyone’s complaints. We are not against overpowered guns, we are against overpowered guns that everyone can use with no skill. Shotguns actually require skill to use, and it feels much more rewarding to hit your shots with them. Again, this is because of all our complaints.

It is 100% our fault. Everyone is saying they miss the good old days in season 2 and 3. But remember how back then everyone was bitching about double pump? We all asked for a new meta and complained about the double shotgun meta being stale. They gave us what we wanted, and now we complain. 

I do think we should let epic experiment with things, and give them a few more weeks. To clarify, I’m not demanding anything from them, just suggesting how they should move forward. Remember when traps got nerfed and everyone complained? They were just experimenting with it and ended up putting them up to 150 damage. The same thing could happen here with smg’s but in vice versa. They buffed them more and more and now they may drastically nerf them.

I hope that the new meta will involve shotguns. No, I don’t want double pump. I want shotguns to be the main weapon in close quarters combat, and they should be doing over 100 damage with every  3 or 4 pellets that hit. This is not OP because it takes skill to hit your shots. Maybe even a pistol meta. It would be brand new and there are different pistols for different players. Dual pistols for players who like shotgun type weapons, suppressed and normal pistols for people who like spam (that’s not overpowered) and deagles/revolvers for ranged fights.

Season 5 has been a disaster so far and Epic hasn’t been very communicative. Not only that, it seems as if they’ve turned a deaf ear to all the sub as a whole. Yeah I know people whine, but there are some really good posts on here that deserve attention.

They didn’t meet any of the expectations people would have liked to see such as: 

—Nerfing splodes back to their original state

—Nerfing the spam meta

—Buffing shotguns (damage for the tac, swap delay removed on the pump)

—Old music

—buffing silenced pistols

—buffing mats

Epic has done a lot of things right in the past, and I think everyone was expecting this update to be a good one and one that begins to fix the problem, but it wasn’t even close. I was extremely disappointed when I read the patch notes. 

P.S. Who asked for the dual pistol nerf? I don’t even use them and always thought they were underpowered, then they get nerfed? What’s up with that?!?",FortNiteBR

Have you even been in a fight since patch 5.0 where any player has used anything but the Smg or shotgun to fight with you?

I think their needs to be a complete weapon rework. if I was the lead multiplayer designer at epic I would do this please think about this epic because shotguns and smg's are being abused way too much in PvP battles ",FortNiteBR

The community is getting fed up of the spray and pray meta and the constant use of smgs, also to make the situation better the material drop rate is getting nerfed at an alarming rate preventing good build battles which is what makes this game so successful. 

Meta;
There is a lack of diversity in the meta meaning that everyone is constantly using the same weapons and no one is any different within a battle because of the current meta, everyone is either using smgs. Or drum guns creating a detour based on spam which makes building almost useless. To counter act this there should be more significant balances to these weapons to make them powerful in certain situations however nerf them on other ways to make them play how they should be.

Material nerf:
The material nerf is the massive killer because it discourages building which is what this game strives on and without it it will destroy the game. So make buff harvesting again and make it so materials are easier to gather to encourage more build fights to cancel out the current meta.

So please epic and reddit make this happen so we can revive fortnite and get it out of the hole it has gotten itself into.

Thanks for reading

Most skins are white coloured and male. I'd love to spend more money but I think Epic is only catering the white American male audience.

Currently on the Epic store, this is the breakdown of male/female and ethnic minority make-up compared to the American population.

On Fortnite:

Male - 78%     
Female - 22%    

USA population:

Male - 49%    
Female - 51%

On Fortnite:

White - 90%   
African American - 5%
East Asian - 1%
Latino - 0% representation
Native American - 0% representation

Non human characters - 2%

USA population:
  
White - 62%            
Latino - 17.3%       
African American - 12.6%      
East Asian - 3%    
Native American - 0.8%

We can clearly see that there are discrepancies between the two. Epic Games is an American gaming company that should cater to ALL Americans. 

I hope the developers read this so we have a more inclusive environment that's more family-friendly and diverse.

Instead of fixing bugs that genuinely ruin this game they continue to “fix” and change what made this game fun in the first place. I love this game and want to see it succeed for years but the way epic is going about most of the changes in recent months isn’t the way to do it, I don’t want to see this game go down like paragon.

They really do try their very best. They listen to the players and make moves based on what they say. Which is exactly what put them into this mess. Epic games listens to its players. When everyone complained about the double pump: it was removed. Plain and simple. Everyone complained about the building skillgap? Nerfed. People complained SMGs were no match for a shotgun? Not anymore, thanks to Epic. 

The problem is that gaming communities are toxic, whirling balls of nonesense filled with actual children, who will complain about anything and everything. And game developers who take this as actual feedback struggle to make any sense of it. Game developers like Activision and EA get alot of hate for ignoring player complaints, but there is a reason those two own the gaming industry. They don't listen to the crying masses of players that got all upset when things didn't go their way. They have independent playtesters, they get the feedback they need, they make their own decisions. 

I can think of so many examples, but Destiny 2 is probably the most recent. Bungie, like Epic, listens too closely. When people from D1 complained about all the difficult, grindy activities, and the difficult, unbalanced PVP, Bungie devs took it to heart. They constructed D2, which was the perfect amalgamation of all player feedback. No more waiting to get into the action. More stories, less grindy loot system, easier stuff to obtain, easier activities, and PvP was so incredibly balanced that no weapon was anymore powerful than the next. So, everyone played D2 even more than D1 and everything was fine, right? Absolutely not. D2 is an actual graveyard that even hardcore destiny fans stay away from. 

The fact of the matter is that a playerbase for any game is going to be full of toxic people who complain about anything they can. Good ideas get drowned in the noise. People who play and enjoy the game until something gets changed are the ones that get trully alienated when you listen to this nonesense, and those are the players that matter. This is the hole that Epic has put themselves in. If Epic games kills Fortnite, it won't be because they don't listen to us, the players. It will be because they do.",FortNiteBR

I went through all the most used stretched resolutions ( 1600 x 1080, 1440 x 1080, 1154 x 1080, and 1024 x 1080 ) what I have found is that any resolutions under 1600 as your ""ResolutionSizeX"" will cause your crosshair to look transparent and almost impossible to see. My guess is this is epic's way of getting people off of playing stretched because it gives players a strategical advantage. 

If you don't know what stretched does it gives the player playing a lower resolution but stretches the screen horizontally making heads and bodies bigger. Counter Strike pros do this A LOT and most of the community plays this way as it gives them the best chance to get headshots. 

This is just what I found if someone finds a way to fix the crosshair then you would be an OG. For players like me who played on this res for years ( 5 years in CS for me ) then this is tragic. Sensitivities feel different and it feels like learning a whole new game. Thanks for reading hope epic decides to revert or change it so we can have our center dot back :)",FortNiteBR

Vault drum gun, the drum gun does exactly what the mini gun does except it’s used as more than just a building destroy, and it does just about every job better than every other gun. The mini gun is actually really good right now but there’s just no reason to use it when you have a drum gun with 50 bullets. It’s not quite an AR but it does better than SMG damage, it’s blatantly OP. 

2.	Reduce P90 mag to 35 bullets like the Tac SMG was. When they first vaulted the Tac SMG and came out with the compact there were more than a few times I wasn’t used to having 5 less bullets. This lets it keep that purple legendary specialty over than white-blue. 

3.	Buff shotguns. They are crap lol. I remember EPIC released a big statement once when they started to nerf building and shotguns, they want there to be multiple available load-outs not just shotguns. Ok so now guess what the game is all about SMGs, what happened to wanting diversity? You carry a shotgun yeah but you have to have an SMG to back it up because a shotgun alone you’re 100% going to die against someone with equal skill and an SMG/drumgun.

These 3 changes I feel would put the game in a good state. In point 3 I reference that statement EPIC made at one point with the game not being just shotguns, I had just thought about that right before I typed it. Anyway, the more I think about it the more they basically just made themselves hypocrites cause SMGs/drumgun currently rule the game as shotguns did. A change is needed.

First of all, the second i dropped out of the bus, my sound cut out entirely.  Voice chat worked fine but no Fortnite sound.  Which is beyond stupid and hasn't happened with Fortnite before nor was this currently happening with any other window i had open.  (i.e.: youtube.) . Then, when the game was over, I tried restarting Fortnite to see if that would correct the already stupid issue.  So i pressed the red X, told my squad i would brb and then the window pops up: ""Are you sure you want to quit Fortnite"" . I couldn't press confirm fast enough.  But APPARENTLY, I CLICKED IT TOO FAST because Fortnite froze right there.  I tried a series of keyboard short cuts to get this piece of trash to close.  Alt+F4 did not work.  Just didn't want to happen . Ctrl+shift+esc.  Nope!  Task manager wasn't even openable.  Alt+TAB to press the red X on fortnite.  NOPE!  And, I even clicked on the task manager in the alt tab menu, but that just brought me back to fortnite.  Because that's what I was supposed to be looking at at that moment.  A frozen screen of fortnite that would have probably lasted an eternity if i didn't become so enraged that I just unplugged the power cord from my computer.  I even tried using ctrl alt delete and logged out.  But when i logged back in, the computer screen just went black.

One of my favorite things about the new playground was the 3x loot. This insured that the 1v1s me and my brother had were fair, not just luck on who got the better stuff, as we were pretty much both guaranteed to get great stuff. With it going back to 1x loot, it will again go back to luck. And please don't mention supply drops, as they seem to 1, always be SUPER loud even if they are across the map, and 2, never be close enough near be to be worth it. WE usually start 1v1ing around 10 minutes in, and I will have MAYBE seen 1 supply drop by then if i'm lucky, and that doesnt mean its anywhere near me. As well as that, you're not even guaranteed to get good stuff from it, you could just NEED an RPG because my friends have one, but I wasn't lucky enough to get one from chests or supply drops, so now i'm at a huge disadvantage over my friends. I just hope that this can be but back to 3x, as it heavily reduced the luck factor of out 1v1, and increased the skill factor, which I overall want.

TL;DR, Reducing loot drops makes the 1v1s and whos wins them more luck based and less skill based, which I (and I am sure many others) do not want.",FortNiteBR

Epic actually pays attention over there, so the likely hood of this ever getting fixed is nil.""

Many of us can only play on the Switch using gyro-based motion aiming, which was a God-send when the feature was added with the 5.0 release coinciding with Season 5. But with the 5.1 update, they made what seemed to be intended quality-of-life changes... and inadvertently broke the entire system. The X-axis movement method was changed to a method that only feels natural when holding the Switch in portable mode, and they **accidentally** inverted the Y axis, so now the gyro goes in the **opposite** direction of the joystick. 

Since then, there has been no acknowledgement of this issue - Epic has yet to address the oversight, identify it publicly or anything (there was one ""I'll pass it on"" comment on the forums that SEVERAL people have kept pointing to as the only real response from Epic on this issue). 

Three patches have since dropped on the Switch (including one fixing a Playgrounds nameplate issue, something the other systems didn't need a hotfix for), and not a single patch has addressed a problem that has made the game unplayable for a measurable portion of the Switch player base.

**At this point, the motion controls have been broken for longer than they have been implemented, and we still don't have a single hint showing that Epic is addressing it.**

So another patch has come and gone and Epic still seem to be refusing to acknowledge the 'spray and pray' meta which is plaguing the game. The new shotgun is arguably the least useful shotgun in the game and is literally outclassed by grey SMGs. Build fights are becoming a thing of the past. Yet still Epic refuse to act or even communicate their plan with us. They've received CONSTANT negative feedback regarding the state of SMGs and the constant building nerfs yet still they continue in this direction. We had a thread with 11 THOUSAND upvotes a few days ago that detailed the current issues and still... nothing. 

Now, I'm not here to demand changes or tell Epic what to do with their game etc. I'm just asking for clarification on what their end game is with Fortnite. Because if it's to continue restricting building and emphasising RNG based spraying then, I and many others, would appreciate being told so. Because, with all due respect, I don't really feel like sinking more money, and time, into a game I probably won't be continuing to play. Right now, I feel like I'm playing out of habit and just hoping they'll eventually fix the MAJOR issues with the meta. But if this is going to be the long-term direction for Fortnite, I'd rather just move on now. 

Again, they're welcome to do what they want.. but the vast majority of this community are unhappy with the recent changes and I'm sure we'd rather know if this is going to be for the long-term. 

Thanks,

Caul ",FortNiteBR

TL;DR: Fortnite without shotgun buildfights isn't FortNite for those of us who have been here since season 1, it's now just a crappy arcade shooter with unrewarding mechanics. Which makes wins as unsatisfying as losses.



My stats, if anyone is interested in where I'm coming from. I've got 1000+ wins, and thuroughly enjoyed this game for longer than I expected to.

This game will go in 2 directions, a somewhat balanced one, and a chaotic game breaking one. The balanced one will see many people running 2 weapons, 2 heals, and one explosive item (rockets, c4, clingers, Etc.) / utility (impulse, stink, etc.). The 2 weapons people will have will vary by play style, variants being: short + long range, short + medium range, and medium + long range weapons ( I personally would run something like pump and bolt: short+long). Pretty balanced in my opinion. Now, the other direction the game could go would be much worse. It would basically be an even more cancerous version of the current meta, and many people would run 2-3 (spammable) weapons 1-2 heals, and splodes. Overall we will definitely see a domination of explosives in the upcoming meta. Also, take what I say with a grain of salt because I have to assume that the smg’s that currently dominate the game are not going to see any game changing nerfs, and that building is not going to be largely buffed anytime soon. Now if all of this seems like a scary thing to you because you love this game just as I do, then do something about it. Instead of confirming to the current meta, make your own play style that you can use effectively, if you are comfortable with the pump shotgun, USE IT. Being proactive against any meta is the best thing you can do to counter it. This requires a lot more attention to detail within the game, and some deep strategizing, but it will also make you a much better player. Overall, please take what I say into consideration, and hopefully we can turn this awful meta around and make the most of the current state of the game, and thank you. PS: Much love to Dakotaz and his stream for being welcoming of what I had to say in the first place.",FortNiteBR

I used to win games left and right during season 3 and 4, But recently I've been getting into unavoidable situations that only god tier skill would make me survive in, Like getting teamed on, Getting 2 people doing nothing but shooting at me and not even building, Running out of ammo extremely fast, Running out of hundreds of materials very quickly with no idea why..

I'm getting really close to just quitting the game because of how unfair it can be at times, When you're constantly dying over and over again to the dumbest situations it's not fun anymore, I try to play every day but can't motivate myself to.

And don't just quote Ninja and say ""oH, jUsT lOoK aT yOuR rEpLaYs AnD sEe HoW yOu DiEd"", Because i already do that. And it doesn't ever work, Every single situation i get put into is or is close to in-escapable. And also, I have taken breaks, That doesn't help either.

I've been playing since season 2 and i used to be really good, But i now i just die right as the game starts, I'm much worse than i usually was and i have no idea why, This is my cry for help.",FortNiteBR

Remember when people were getting pushed under the map when being in buildings when they were being placed. How did they fix it? Make people walk through your buildings.

People use ATKs and shopping to get under the map so they make it so you can’t place build on the tile of the vehicle??? This can easily get you killed and once again it’s a nerf to building. 

The community has complained for ages about material floor loot reduction, the building nerf, the p90, smg spam, nerfs to things like the white trees and some bushes and all we get is the ability to honk in the ATK.

I've been playing since season 1, even before there were duos and supply drops, and this has got to be the worst meta I have seen. The most recent updates to Fortnite have changed the game, and not in a good way. The last 2 C4 nerfs(yes, including the one that just came out) are needed, but C4 is still very overpowered. ARs are almost obsolete as smgs do much higher DPS and shred even if you are blocking shots with building. I feel like rocket/grenade launchers are in a good position right now, as they are supposed to be MILITARY GRADE explosive weapons, while the c4 should still have a rarity upgrade to make it rarer/a building damage nerf. shotgun smg is fine but SMG DPS should still be nerfed across the board. The minigun is also in a very strange spot currently, as it is extremely overpowered when used right, but never seems to be used that way. Miniguns can easily shred through buildings and should have some sort of a cooldown timer after firing for a certain amount of time. ARs should get a DPS buff by slightly increasing firerate, as they feel extremely slow now. The pump shotgun should have had it's pullout time(as in edit building -&gt; pulling out pump) fixed at the VERY BEGINNING of season 5, yet it still hasn't, that should definitely happen, along with the damage nerf being reverted to be able to 1-pump enemies, as double pumping is nonexistent now.  
Now, onto building. the nerf to wood's beginning health should not have happened. When taking someone head on, brick is now almost the same as wood, as both of their beginning health is the exact same(as of what I last remember), and wood is only better for it's faster health generation speed. The nerf to ghost peeking is fine, but the edited tiles should be completely see-through at the beginning of the building placement, and as the building gains health, the edited tiles should become less opaque, until the tiles turn to how they are currently when the building reaches full health. All buildings should also get an increase in maximum health, to partially stop people from shooting down build fights.   
I would talk about bloom, but everyone already knows about how bad it is compared to a system with fixed recoil patterns, and it seems to already be too late to change such a core game mechanic as the recoil system of the game.",FortNiteBR

While I appreciate this was implemented for the ‘fun’ aspect of the game. But while they are adding things like that. The current state of the game, and the meta, make the game even less fun. 

Also why did they change the animation of your character swinging their pickaxe??? This was totally not needed. 

What is needed it shotguns need to be put back where they used to be. SMG’s need nerfing. Building needs buffing. 

And all while these problems are in the game. They are changing the way your character swings their pickaxe?? 

Why.

Not to mention they add new weapons LITERALLY EVERY WEEK. 

Why not take a week off introducing new weapons and instead make the game more balanced and more enjoyable to play on a competitive level, and a casual level at the same time. 

Adding weapons literally increases the RNG that already ruled this game.

By doing this, we can use the upvote system to measure severity/frequency and also provide the developers with more info than simply, ""Hey, this thing is not working, can you fix? Thanks."" While allowing less severe/frequent bugs some more visibility instead of flooding the thread with the same bug.

Dusk probably bit Drift and he turned into Sanctum (he looks just like Drift lmao) Brite Bomber was probably killed by Dark Bomber (if we take a look at Dark Bomber's art posted on Fortnite's reddit, we can see Brite cuddled up into a ball as she looks on to Dark) and Rex and Cuddle were possibly also killed by their Dark counter parts. (Not revealed yet, hinted at because of the Ghost Portal backbling). That could also explain (from a storyline stand point not from a business one) why Brite, Cuddle Team and Rex started appearing less and less in the item shop. They are dead.

I was beginning to find it a bit repetitive to play fortnite lately, and then apex came out. Since the first time I played apex, I could not be happier, and that's the reason. Although a lot of people are saying something like ""apex will kill fortnite"" and other people saying ""apex is too bad"", I think it will be different. I think now that Fortnite has a strong competitor, we gamers have nothing to lose. When Apex loses its strength a bit (this is going to happen in a while, because the game has been released recently), if the Apex developers do not make any big mistakes ( I hope not), the developers of both games will always be giving your best or trying to bring new things or new mechanics, in a ""race"" to see who does the best. This possible future competitiveness will be very good for players, who will generally be receiving the best that developers could offer.

The boulders cracked through the ice, the snow that was left melted, and then everything went still. Lava crept down the newly formed volcano and I thought to myself, “Where is my phone?”. I promptly searched for it and eventually found it, I opened the map and polar peak had been replaced with volcano (something I don’t quite remember).

The trailer had us all questioning the characters.
The images/teasers they posted were awesome.

Season 4 brought us many new things. Styles, Sprays,  the Challenge skins (Blockbuster, etc.), etc. while also keeping true to Fortnite.

Many of us joined in this time, others before. This season was mostly balanced in guns, and the battle pass was great. Having super hero/villain characters with some wacky ones (Zoey!) that some consider fan favorites. 

Season 4 brought a storyline into the picture. It wasn’t just about skins anymore, it was about a big meteor crashing into the Fortnite map, and the story that came from that.

Season 4 started live events. The rocket ship set the standards high, and for their first try at an event was amazing.

Weather you like it or not, Season 4 was *almost* the perfect season. It could’ve been tweaked a little bit, but other than that it is the reason Fortnite is.. well Fortnite. The events, wacky characters, storylines are all because of Season 4.

I hope you guys leave your opinions on this season. I have played Fortnite for a while, and Season 4 was magical in my opinion. Dropping into moisty mire with some friends, hitting the prison, getting those hop rocks and winning the games. Even the shopping cart glitch was hilarious and I kind of wish it was still here.

This season ends with a big earthquake. Trees falling, sinkholes, parts of the map underwater.

Last Season we learned that Castor and Elmira (the wizard skins) are able to control the rifts, right?! The Emote that came out with their skins showed us they can spawn and despawn dancing Llamas around them by using said rifts. We also saw that the same people that were building around the main meteorite in Dusty (the government?) set up a bunker underneath wailing woods where they managed to create a permarift and portals. 

So i believe that either the wizards or the government is going to rift/teleport us into the in-between we were in during the butterfly event. And instead of finding a new island, we are going back in time...  I'd say Season 1 or 2, long before we saw a meteorite in the sky. And I'm ONLY talking about the map, not the meta... no old weapons/items, no double pump etc. JUST the map. Simply because Epic is giving us way too many Dusty Depot hints. The battle pass tier 98 loading screen, all the pictures around the map and (IMO the biggest hint) the thumbnail of the ""Unvaulted"" LTM. The thumbnail wasn't shot in just any of the 3 Depot's, it was inside of the blue on (the only one that got completely destroyed). 

Maybe it's not the in-between we are getting teleported to, maybe just into the sky so we can actually see how the map is evolving backwards. 

And everything ends with the visitor going back into his capsule in the meteorite and it launching off the ground. Just play the season 4 trailer backwards so you guys know what I mean :D 

OR

People (the government?) are rebuilding a better version of our current map on a different island. No big crater, but instead the old Dusty; the leftovers of the Cube runes (shadow stone spawn locations) around the map are gone; A massive Durr Burger restaurant instead of Tomato Temple (because Durr Burger won the vote, remember?) etc. and before the inevitable happens and the the islands sinks into the ocean, we are getting rifted/teleported to the new island. Or maybe the (then born) Dragons are giving us a ride to the new Island and therefore saving all of us

This feature.  
Is the breakthrough in Battle Royale. 
How many of you have said
‘okay time to reset’
‘Damn this could’ve been a good match if you didn’t get bursted back there’
‘It’s cool we’ll just restart’ *has 4 kills but teammate has been bursted* 

The time is now to make a huge fortnite change that we have all been longing for but haven’t discovered what the necessary change is. 
For me and for a lot of players like me, the dub is good, yeah. But the dub is 100% better, more worth while, feels more achieved, and it’s an all around better feeling if you win while your team is still with you in the game. 

Me personally I usually squad up with my buddies. And more matches than not one of us gets bursted and we are stuck in a 3 man or 2 man situation. Because either your teammate didn’t land on the pump shotgun, or was stuck with a Scoped weapon or handgun in close range combat while the enemy pulls a Rocket Launcher from their first chest. Yeah you can win. But imagine after you wipe Salty Springs or Tilted Towers or Pleasant Park. 

You have the option if within the time limit to go and retrieve your teammates banner and revive him at an expedition outpost station. 
 
Think about it
The time is now for change 
Revive your fallen bursted comrades and still enjoy the match you’re in, instead of constantly playing for the next game. Play the one you are in!! 
After you or your teammates get bursted in combat if a surviving member of your squad retrieves your banner in under 90 seconds they have the ability to revive you at certain outposts. 


Think about it and tell me positives and negatives. ",FortNiteBR

Now i already have my arguments layed out and know how i want to make my point.

However while i ahve played the game for like ten hours or so i am not a regular Fortnight player, so if i were to record footage on my own it wouldn't really properly represent the game.

I couldn't really show the (tactical) decisions that you have to make at every step of the game, starting with deciding where you land until the last point in the match where the last survivors cumulate in a last firefight.

Thats why i would ask those of you that dabble in the game if you could bare with my mediocre butt to play and record some sessions for this video with me.

Your help would be appreciated.

Planes would be an amazing thing to have in the game if you could rely on them to get to the zone and people not being able to knock you off a mountain or spraying unlimited bullets at you. 

But now you can’t even use them to get to zone sometimes because only one or two planes spawn now, and by the time you finish looting and need to rotate people have already taken the planes. 

It would be great if they took the gun off planes or gave it limited ammo. Also make it so they can’t run into people and do 50+ damage, and reduce the knock back so you can’t get hit off mountains. That would make planes perfectly balanced. ",FortNiteBR

These explosives have been recommended a need all the way since around season 2-3 since then all epic has done has been to need the ammo but that hasn’t done anything because the real problem is the splash damage on these damn things, I don’t think I should be like 2 blocks away from an rpg and it should do the max damage it does, it really just doesn’t make sense for this game that is said to be balanced. Not only is splash damage a problem but there’s also other little exploits that the community uses to get an unfair advantage on people who are less experienced like that one where you shoot the rocket on the side of the pyramid build and you can easily get into someone’s 1x1. Epic continually ignores the request for a nerf on explosives and instead adds more into the game like the bottle rockets for example. And I get some explosives are less effective like grenades, but the stack size on those are another problem within themself as when someone has a max stack of 10 grenades it’s nearly impossible to come away alive from being attacked by that many. I feel in fixing splash damage on explosives and changing stack size on some explosive items like grenades or dynamite could easily make this game way more enjoyable as both sides of the community have equal complaints towards explosives.",FortNiteBR

Here are some hazard ideas:

Junk Junction - Vent ducts that spray poison gas at random, cause 5 damage just like the Stink Bombs. WARNING: Destroying a duct can spawn a massive cloud of poison gas. 

Haunted Hills (idea by u/Ohayward) - Zombies! Yup, Zombies. Exactly like the ones from Fortnitemares and Ice Storm.

Lonely Lodge - Bear Traps! Just... Bear Traps. Cause 10 damage, traps the player for 5 seconds.

Tomato Temple - Nightshade and Tomatohead NPCs that throw tomatoes at you, but they won't deal any damage to you. If you get hit by a tomato, your screen will be filled with tomato sauce! (That means it'll block your view for a few seconds) Only 3 Tomato NPCs spawn in Tomato Temple per match. 

Desert Biome/Paradise Palms - Quicksand! It's... Quicksand! :D

Polar Peak - Ice Fiends may spawn sometimes...

And that was pretty much it. Would you like to see POI Hazards in-game? Do you have anything that could make this concept better? Any ideas for hazards?

I can't speak on behalf of everyone else but let me share my story. From the end of season 3 when I first got really into Fortnite, many things drew me in. I had never played a game like it, a massive kill everyone and be the last alive was really cool, but i was way more interested in it's art direction and attitude. I loved the cartoony art, the not so serious tone and the really fascinating and innovative storytelling. I watched all the top lists ranking all the guns, locations and skins. I loved the community and how despite it being a pvp game, so many players where still friendly to each other and would just dance about together. I even did a lot of blogs and ranking lists of my own on other sites. But no interest lasts forever.

&amp;#x200B;

First was my interest in the story. I stopped caring because they stopped doing unique storytelling in favor of just doing random stuff with very little connection to each other. Really how did the randomness of the cube turn into an iceberg hitting the island? Does anyone even understand the cube or was it literally just extreamly random nothing? On top of it all, season 5 felt like it was building something up with that cast of characters. Drift, Bomber and Rex all felt like they were gonna do something in the story continuing on, but they just abandoned them like they died. Heck in season 7 there was no story in the loading screens. Just a bunch of loading screens for each character that never connected. I'm sure there is still a story going on, but it all feels too random and loosly connected just so the new skins can take the spotlight rather than actually build something cool with already established characters. 

&amp;#x200B;

Next was casual enjoyment. You used to go in, find a quite spot and take your time. Maybe meet a random player and dance a bit or help out. Now it's nothing but competitive players who build a skyscraper at a moments notice and don't care about anything but winning and killing. No longer can I do a shooting range challenge without some tryhard killing me despite dancing to show i'm not here to fight. Just strait up I become an easy kill so tryhard can brag about his 8 kill game. Also let's talk challenges. They used to be fun, unique and different. Remember the puzzle search in season 5? Now cool challenges like that are like one every two to three weeks. It's nothing but rehashed challenges from old seasons, find this and use it or land here open this challenges. No longer can you play a casual game and all challenges feel like chores. There's so fun left. Even here on Reddit most of the top posts now are just impressive plays and cosmetic ideas. Which cosmetics are pointless if you never get to show them off in games when you get merced immediately.

&amp;#x200B;

While on that topic, let's talk about Cosmetics. There are too many coming out too fast. Nobody has the money when they come out and when someone does have the money, they never come back, at least not for months. Instead they just keep adding more. Finally you buy something else when oh boy, it came back finally and you wanted it so badly you shell out more money. That kind of marketing is soooo genius but sooooooo manipulative. I both hate the system but also give it credit. But now I own too much stuff and I don't know what to do with it. I don't use 75% of my skins and 80% of all other items. I'm kinda just burnt out on cosmetics, and don't even ask me how much iv'e spent on cosmetics, doing the math scared me and has me depressed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think season 8 is my dropping off point. I don't care for anything in the game anymore. I don't care about the story, I don't care about cosmetics and I can't have fun casual games. Maybe I just need a season to take a break, but considering that you need to keep playing an online game to stay within the skill ceiling, I think this might be the end. Heck, even Ninja seems to be trying to move on now. Apex is a lot of fun. But what do you all think? Are you all getting tired and burnt out too, do you still love this game to death or are you new and only just getting into it? I want to have a bit of a discussion.",FortNiteBR

* How much of an impact do zombies have late game, in terms of gameplay?
* Are they more of a useful asset to the game or an inconvenience?
* Could the spawn rate be adjusted for certain points within the game, if so, how much?
* Should loot drops from zombies provide more or less loot to provide balance?

The stronger points are below.
Firstly. Wailing woods has been one of the most mysterious points on the map for a while, including the unused bunker. 
Secondly, if there does end up being a sinkhole like some of mentioned, it would be an awesome move to have it over the tunnels below wailing. It could make them much more accessible and act like a bit bit full of loot and rifts. 
It also creates a reason for there to be a sinkhole, maybe the tunnels all collapse when the earthquake occurs. If this isn’t already the case, EPIC, get on it!

MAJOR POINTS:
1.) SPOILER ALERT: According to leaks posted on the sub, the earthquake is meant to included a trees falling phase. Usually these events are permanent, so any effects are going to carry over to following games.
Why would EPIC remove trees?! That’s one of the most important farming mats. Even if only a few are destroyed and left permanently, it wouldn’t be a very exciting difference, and all it would be doing is increasing the skill gap (and we all know how EPIC feels about that).
This event WOULD MAKE PERFECT SENSE FOR WAILING WOODS! All the trees will be gone and a crater/sinkhole/volcano and so on will happen. They’d have to remove the trees first so people can see it happen love especially if it is. It would spice up wailing woods again and make people go there again. All the trees will fall from wailing when the probably live earthquake happens so players can see the rest of the event clearly, and also because they’ll be destroyed by the event.

2.) the top right section of the map is the only major area that has been unaffected. The other 4/5 sectors of the map have been changed by each season.
S4 = centre (dusty divot)
S5 = bottom right (desert biome)
S6 = top left (leaky lake)
S7 = bottom left (snow biome)
Now it’s season 8, and the only place left untouched for the most part is top right (wailing woods).

3.) Wailing woods is the closest point on the map to the supposed season 8 relevant (volcano) mountain north east of the map people have discussed. The mountain is missing in season 8 loading screens, meaning something must happen to it, possibly a volcano. It also has a mysterious light on it people have spotted. If it explodes, wailing woods would be the first place it hits, since it’s in very close proximity.

I noticed there are some great skins in the paid battle pass, and I really love the Lynx one. I can't afford it, but I have heard mentions of people earning the currency through winning matches,  is this right? Then I wanna aim at winning even though it's really difficult.

The gunplay is incredibly different and takes a little getting used to, but what I truly find overwhelming is the building aspect. I find it so difficult to switch between different structure shapes on the spot, so I can defend myself from the players shooting me. It’s even worse when I attack someone. They usually build an entire building around them, while constantly building and climbing stairs so they get above me and start shooting. 

Apart from all the things that players should experience first-hand, do you have any tips for someone who is currently looking to get into this game? Thanks. ",FortNiteBR

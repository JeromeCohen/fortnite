In PUBG, you can play in, well obviously, first or third person, I actually prefer first person for the game, and I realized about in season 3, that Fortnite in first person mode could be a reality.

&amp;#x200B;

BELOW IS A CONCEPT IMAGE

https://i.redd.it/imrou0qqik021.jpg

The reason I believe this is a good idea is because it'd feel like a new game entirely, from building, to gunfights, or even looting. Fortnite in first person mode would be EPIC (get it?)

&amp;#x200B;

The way Fortnite could implement this is by adding a new LTM, or just merging it into solo entirely, which when before joining a game have the option to be in first or third person.

1. The 100% mat buff + the mats you get from kills 

2. The matches don’t last as long. Some people like quick matches. Crazy right? 

3. less people makes it more of a tactical battle and not chaos like in disco domination and 50’s. You can’t ever kill more than like 5 people without the whole team lasering you in the back because the areas are condensed with enemies.

4. Less lag. I had so much lag in disco domination and 50’s it was ridiculous. At least on console the experience was horrible and laggy. Food fight has no lag because there’s not a lot of people.

5. When people leave it doesn’t matter. I’m just putting this point because I see a lot of people say “If two or three people leave in foodfight we can’t win” that’s absolute horseshit because I won a lot of games that was 9-12. Who wins has more to do with skill level on each team and position of the mascots. Stop worrying about how many people are on your team and just play

6. No explosives(except dynamite). Disco domination had way too much no-skill rpg suicide bombers.

7. Can properly build around and protect the objective. In disco domination you can’t build over your dance floors which gives the other team easy kills since you literally can’t build and have to dance which makes you a sitting duck.

I’m sure a lot of people like it for some of my reasons. Some people seems to think **everyone** hates food fight but that’s not true at all.",FortNiteBR

54,Ramman321,1543189630,a0dtkm,16,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a0dtkm/my_full_opinion_on_season_6/,1,My Full Opinion on Season 6,"Season six is coming to a close, and all in all, it was somewhat decent. For me, the second worst season (following Season four). Please read all of this before you start roasting me to hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start with this: Season five was a breath of fresh air. Maybe it was the major map overhauls that kicked off the season and continued throughout, or the carts, who knows, but it was by far my favorite season. My friends and I would be done with most weekly challenges within the day they came out. Going into season six after what was my favorite season, I had very high hopes.

&amp;#x200B;

As soon as I launched Fortnite following the update, I thought the pets were a cool addition, and I liked the variety of skins. For whatever reason, the cube at this point wasn't very interesting to me. It just went to each part of the map and did stuff. I couldn't care to pay attention, HOWEVER, I do really like what Leaky Lake has become, so there's that. It heavily optimized Loot Lake into something actually navigable. Besides all this Leaky Lake stuff, however, there weren't very many map changes. A few subtle ones here and there, like Wailing Woods getting an overhaul, and the Halloween event, but not much more than that.

&amp;#x200B;

However, those are mostly personal nitpicks. Time to get into some factual problems.

&amp;#x200B;

**Challenges:**

This season, these felt like one-off tasks or chores. Most felt very random and didn't flow with other challenges. That's something I've always liked about Fortnite - the challenges could be done in groups at a time, but not this season. Most challenges, like the explosives-related ones, you'd have to go out of your way to get. There were a lot of challenges this season that involved you going from location to location to discover where one specific, little thing is. As someone who isn't a huge fan of looking online for locations, this irritated me, and many others. The music sheets, pianos, games, things like that, were very time consuming to find, and I did eventually go to a guide for them. There's nothing wrong with these challenges, but I feel there were too many of them. Oh, and the sniper challenges; yeah, those were hard, but that's not Epic's fault.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all is bad, however. I'm a casual player, not someone trying to specifically go for the win every match. I like to fuck around on quads and try new things. I've been playing since season 3 and only have 11 wins for that reason. That said, I'm not that great at this game. Most of the kill challenges tend to give me problems, and these certainly did, but it was great. None of the kill challenges (minus the explosive ones) were impossible, and they forced me to come up with new plans to attack and gain new skills. I liked this. This is what challenges should do: help you grow.  


**Bugs:**

Bugs are bound to happen with frequent updates, which is understandable. What isn't, however, is Epic flooding the game with new content, while leaving these bugs in and creating new ones at the same time. Like I said, I'm a casual player. I don't mind the bugs and glitches, but when it gets to the point where I'm even questioning what's happening, there's an issue. I couldn't possibly list off the amount of bugs that currently exist, but I know a solid amount of them have effected me. The big legs bug, the invisibility bug/exploit, and the various build exploits. These normally wouldn't bother me if they only happen once or twice, and are patched and fixed, but these have all happened multiple times throughout this season, and that's not fun.

&amp;#x200B;

On the flip side, some bugs and exploits are kinda cool and can change the meta of the game. I can't think of any off the top of my head except for the infinite quad flight trick. It requires skill, it doesn't make you invincible, and it's fun, and hasn't caused many issues. Like I said, some bugs and exploits can eventually be turned into actual game mechanics, and maybe, at least one of these this season, will be just that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fortnitemares:**

I personally had no problem with this game mode. I thought it was a fun twist on things. However, I can understand where the anger is coming from. Replacing the three main modes with a zomb- *ahem*\- cube monster shooting mode? That's not everyone's cup of tea, and I think that Fornitemares should've been it's own game mode. It was turned into one after the main event, but, obviously, it was a little too late at that point. Like I said, I had no problem with it, but for many, it turned the game into a complete shitshow.

&amp;#x200B;

**Verdict:**

This season introduced a lot of new, cool mechanics, and focused on throwing those out as often as they could and didn't focus on quality of life changes that truly matter the most. In the long run, those are the patches and fixes that will have a lasting impact, not the introduction of balloons or a gun that's going to get vaulted in two months. I feel like this season would've been way better if challenges were more organized, created new animations and models for the shield pots, and improved other things WHILE introducing new things.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I love this game. I know my opinion is probably shit to most, but I think it brings up issues that all of us can admit to coming across. Not everything is bad here, though. The skins are pretty great (especially the one for completing seven weeks of challenges) and the map changes, while minimal, are nice to an extent. Still salty about them destroying the prison though.

&amp;#x200B;

**Too lazy to read it all? Here are the main points:**

**- Challenges were random and chore-like**

**- Not enough meaningful items and changes**

**- Bugs galore**

**- Non-patched bugs**

**- Fortnitemares wasn't fun for everyone**

**- Earlier seasons were much more fun**

These are my (trash) stats if anyone wants to see them: [https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Jesdga95](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Jesdga95) (PC K/D is better because I've played a lot of shooters on there, but I don't play a lot of Fortnite on PC)

I'm tier 100, level 99 currently.   This game requires too much time to hit those levels.   People buying tiers is literally paying money so they don't have to play the game.

This could be something such as a hug which is where you literally just hug you teammate. Only 1 person would need the emote for another person to join in to make it more interactive. Enemies can also join in with you to make it that much more enjoyable. Some examples of teammotes could be:
  
• hug: arms would be spread out asif ready to hug somebody. If somebody near you opens the emote screen, if they are close enough then there will be an option to join in with the hug. If nobody joins in the hug within a certain time period then it could do something such as stumble and look down or just put your arms down and continue with life
  
• kiss: same as the hug emote however with kissing (obviously)
  
• handshake: shake hands with another person
  
• secret handshake: like the handshake however with more twists and more complexity (secret handshakes in movies or real life where you make them with your friends etc)

• wheel barrel: like the wheel barrel where one person is on the floor holding themselves up with their hands and one person has hold of their legs whilst running together (same speed as walking, can be done while moving)
  
• high five: literally a high-five

Obviously there are not an infinite amount of possibilities however there are a lot and i feel like this would be a great addition to the game. The emotes would not be too expensive and as i said only one player would need the emote for multiple players to take part. These emotes could also be done with more than 2 teammates, maybe an emote where multiple t-pose in a line whilst holding hands or something like that.

TL:DR emotes which can multiple people can join in with. Emotes teammates/enemies can join in with.",FortNiteBR

Some of PC players are like gods and they will for sure make good controller players like bots and noobs just because they can :  ""turn faster"" ( they have a higher sensitivity than console player max is = 10 ) , ""edit faster"" ( epic did a great job til now for console when they reduced the edit time but still needs some improvements of editing's sensitivity  ) + "" flickshots"" + "" insta swap between weapons"", ""making their camera stable""  in the middle all the time ( do you know how hard it is to keep your camera stable in the middle of the fight/building when your sensitivity is higher than 9 ( i use 10x/10y ) , ""moving/controlling the mouse"" with their hand not like controller player when he needs to do that only with one finger + ""easy aim"" (tracking)....etc

im not bitching here as some of you may say that, but all we want is a fair challenge against players who has the same advantage/disatvantage. 

We ""know"" exactly pc players will be dominating the tournaments forever i have no doubt in that. ( Wake me up when controller players win 2 tournament in a row against pc players ) 

I wish you could understand how it feels when you get rekt everytime by a god/very good pc players.

Epic created so many tournaments right , so how many controller player won the tournament against pc players , you may say 1 or 2 max in total of more than 20 tournaments at least in the past few months. 

How many controller player was participating in skirmish ( 4/6 max players in a lobby with 96/94 pc players ) and they got rekt by god pc players that are in the same lobby with them. 


My question is : why would we compete against players (pc/k&amp;m) who have already huge advantage on controller players and they keep all the time winning the tournaments.

( my respect to all pc/controller/mobile players )
But it doesnt feel right when you put mobile players againt controller players in the same lobby and expect mobile players to dominate the tournaments. Its litteraly unfair. And its the same thing for controller/ k&amp;m players ... it will never be fair.

Could epic make tournament for different type of device ( mobile/console/pc ) !!!

They say no matter if if you hit only one pellet, youll be rewarded like you hit three. While it will make shotguns feel somewhat more consistent, the problem is a person hitting two or three pellets isnt being rewarded at all for having better accuracy over the person who only hit one.

My suggestion

Shotguns should have a base damage plus pellet damage. For this example well be talking about the blue pump. Keeping the max damage output of the pump for all pellets to the body at 100, the blue pump should have a base damage of 28 and additional pellet damage of 8 per pellet for the remaining nine pellets. The formula would be 28+8x=y 

By implementing this change the pump would do consistent close range damage regardless of accuracy, but still reward people who do have better aim. A person hitting three pellets would now hit for 46, while the person hitting one would only hit for 28. 

Now obviously theyd have to rework the other shotguns as well, but i think this is the best route for epic to take that would make everyone happy and make shotguns great again. 

What do you guys think?

I'd like to discuss this season's challenges, their format and what can be done to tweak some annoyances.

Before I begin, I'm going to say that some Fortnite Battle Royale players might not have a large amount of time available to spend while playing the game. Some of these players are working, studying or have a different reason not to be playing a lot. Since I feel like I fall into this category, I'd like to show you why that this season's challenges take a lot of time to complete because of some inconsistencies.

Firstly, I will separate the challenges in three categories: Exploration, Fighting and Stages. Each week has a number of Exploration challenges, like Week 1's *""Dancing under Streetlights""*, where the player is encouraged to explore the map to complete them. Fighting challenges are all about the fighting aspect of the game. For example, challenges like *Deal X damage with Y weapon, use X in Y different matches*. Then we have challenges that fall into both of these two categories, like *Eliminate X players in Y* (location, like Pleasant Park). In this last case, the challenges work really well.

Now I'll talk about Stages. As mentioned numerous times in this subreddit, **one stage can be completed per match**. This mechanic makes the challenges more repetitive. Stages are only either Fighting or Exploration category type. I will now shortly list more annoyances to avoid the post getting too big.

* **Fighting Stage challenges consume a lot of time to complete.** For example, let's take week 6's obnoxious 5-stage Fighting challenge: *Eliminate 1 player with a common/uncommon/rare/epic and legendary weapon* respectively. This challenge requires a minimum of 5 different matches in order to complete. If the stage mechanic could allow different stages to be completed in one match, this challenge could be completed easily. What's more, there are similar challenges to this one, such as Week 7's *""Regain Health with Apples/Bandages/Medkits/Slurp Juice""* and Week 9's ""*Gain Shield Using Mushrooms/Small Shield Potions/Shield Potions/Chug Jugs"".* It goes without saying that these two could also be completed in a single match, but they force the player to complete them in a minimum of 4 matches, provided that they are lucky enough to find the items. 
* **Exploration Stage challenges are really annoying.** In Week 6's *""Find and play sheet music two times""*, one could easily complete the first two stages as the Sheet Music and Piano are in close proximity. Stage Exploration challenges like *""Visit X and Y in a single match""* could also have multiple stages completed using Quadcrashers or Balloons. What's more, we have Week 7's *""Destroy Trees/Rocks/Cars""* which is actually possible in one match but instead forces the player to complete the match in order to start the next stage. 
* **Stages (except the final) are not visible in the Suggested Challenges menu.**
* **Previous Stages are not shown in the Completed Challenges Menu** in the Lobby.
* **Imbalance between Fighting Challenges and Exploration challenges adds time difficulty:** Week 8 is dominant in Exploration challenges, like: *""Score in Shooting Pigeons"", ""Dance with a fish trophy"", ""Visit X and Y in a single match"" (Stage), ""Visit different named locations in a single match""* and *""Get trick points""* will take a lot of time to complete as I have to keep running around time map to complete. It would of course be much easier if that Stage challenge could have multiple stages completed at once, because that would add synergy to the Exploration. The same applies to Fighting dominant weeks. Week 2 for example, had players use pistols, ARs, Sniper rifles and SMGs to complete.
* **The Suggested Challenges tab is not suggestive at all.** In the current Food Fight LTM, there are no explosive weapons (Grenade Launcher and RPG) that spawn. Yet the Suggested Challenges still recommends that I should go for *Grenade Launcher and RPG Eliminations/Damage* instead. There should be some sort of priority in which challenges are shown. In this case, the Suggested Challenges did not really help me at all.
* **The Suggested Challenges has limited space for challenges.** If it's intended to stay that way, the proper challenges should be shown instead. If not, show ALL the challenges in this screen and let us choose (favorite/pin) which ones we want to be seeing first. The week number should be shown as well.

To conclude, I believe that stage match-lock, the imbalance of categories and the Suggested Challenges screen need a bit of tweaking. I know I'm not supposed to complete all the challenges in one match or fifteen minutes, but since I have limited time to put in this game, and the challenges from previous weeks are hoarding up, it's either complete the challenges or play the game. 

This post is a place of discussion, and I'm eager to know your ideas and opinions about this topic. At the end of the day I could be overreacting, but I still want to know what you guys think.",FortNiteBR

It doesn't help that there is a ton of problems with fortnite in general that are making the game worse, but you literally can't fight people in this. I try my damn hardest, but about half the time I die to some random dude lagging from retail to snobby after he shoots me in the head even though his bullet dodged my head. The framerate drops to 10 if i go into a remotely populated area, and hooking my switch to lan doesn't help at all. The graphics get worse each update, it runs like ass, and every person you fight seems to just lag around. For the minor stuff, we (and mobile) still don't have a career tab, we can't turn on streamer mode for some reason, every single skin is a ramirez (I understand it's probably for performance issues and whatnot, but it's annoying to waste money on cosmetics and not be able to show them off) and we just can't compete with cross-platform in squads and duos. I think it's unfair that ps4 players can be in the same lobby as 2 switch duo players due to the input merging thing they did at the start of the season, and although it's good for keyboard on console, it doesn't help us at all. I just can't understand how it could run so well in season 4, and then get so bad in season 5. FiX yOur GaMe epIc!

1) Reduce the range of which shots are heard from (Maybe not snipers cause it’s a high caliber, rock your tits off sniper rifle)

2) Reduce rift-to-go spawn rates (for being purple it and balloons for some reason spawn quite often)

3) Give the ownership of buildings to the person who killed the other person (so if you’re trapped in a one by one and someone starts quad launchering your stuff you don’t have to try hold your edit button on a wall and think “oh shit” while you pull your pick out and die cause a quad launcher is faster than a pick)

Even with all that being said and all the problems the meta and the game has with all its items and mechanics, epic (knowing them) will add a explosive nobody asked for, or a Ralph LTM (which would be cool...but there are bigger problems to attend to) anyways rant over, this’ll probably be taken down for being too “EPIC PLZ FIX!!1!!!!!” I just needed to get that off my chest

I know there are players out there with vastly greater skillsets than I have, and I still don't consider myself a great player (especially when it comes to aiming and making my shots). What I'm about to say has worked for me, but it's not necessarily guaranteed to work for you.

However, I've started winning a lot more recently, and I mainly credit it to two things: staying near the edge of the storm, and hiding until the last possible minute. I know it's common knowledge that you don't want to run straight to the middle of the circle, but seriously, if you can stay close to the edge you'll be able to ambush people a lot better when the time finally comes to reveal yourself. I will usually hide out somewhere, run with the storm, and find my next spot to stay hidden until the storm moves again. Try to gather traps if you can so you can use them to catch people in your hiding spot. It's such an easy way to get loot. Once you get to the final circle or so, when there's less than five people, you don't have to worry so much about staying hidden (and at that point, it probably won't make much sense to do so anyway). Focusing on taking out your opponents when you get there, still staying somewhat hidden. Once you're down to one other person, try to hide again and wait for them to come towards you. Once they do, you've basically got them. 

I'm curious to know what methods have worked for you guys.

 • infinite health, it cannot be broken, no amount of RPG’s or Minigun bullets can even put a dent in this bad boy
 • invincibility - anybody or anything inside the tank can not be damaged by anything, there are no holes or no weak spots in the tank
 • it can carry up to 8 players, this would be very balanced in LTM’s and other game modes with more than 4 players per team.
 • there are multiple turrets, at least 4 to make it balanced. Turret bullets destroy all buildings (even metal) within a 20 meter radius of the bullets landing. It also hits for 350 damage to the body and 10,450 to the head. There is no cool down delay and infinite ammo. Reload can take a reasonable time, maybe around 0.3 seconds to balance things out.
 • machine guns - atleast 5 mountable machine guns, whilst using the machine gun you can not be shot. Machine guns will have infinite ammo, infinite clip size (no reload necessary) and will hit for 70 to the body (150 to the head). 
 • tank can travel as fast as necessary, maximum speed is slow (as it’s a tank) so i’d say around 150mph (something in kph). 
  • if a player is hit by the tank then they are instantly killed (not knocked, killed, even in duos/squads).
I still believe the tank would be underpowered so any suggestions would be much appreciated",FortNiteBR

People say there is no skill gap, but this is an obvious one. Why should a level 2, for example, get put into a lobby with many, many high levels? If Epic wants no skill gap to attract more new players and make sure they don't quit, put them against people their levels! You could also do it by stats. People with similar stats will be put against people with similiar stats. People who abuse the system by making new accounts to get easy wins should be warned or even have moderation taken against their account.",FortNiteBR

Disco domination and Food fight have the same issue: people not playing the game. Respawn gives people too much freedom, and people such as myself get frustrated when people don't play the game mode. Soaring 50s at least sort of forces players to play the game, or else they'll die. 

Also, Wild West is a ""reduced weapon duo battle royal."" There's no real change in the game mode.

Anyway, I always get annoyed when I get somebody SUPER low, then they decided that since the haven’t been able to hit a shot on me the whole fight , that it will be a good idea to build a wall and then trap for 150+ free damage . I think it’s insane that they can go off almost instantly after they are built , 

I’m not asking for the damage to be nerfed. I just want it to be how it used to be where the building had to be finished in order for it to be activated , or maybe even a little five-ten second timer for it instead. 

I like to think of myself as a good player , I’m on Xbox but I plug in a mouse so I get put into PC lobbies for a harder challenge. I’m not some noob who gets trapped killed 24/7 , it’s just whenever it does happen I get mad that a really good fight was missed out on, or that they can’t aim so they just put traps down to do damage for them.

And while we’re at it there’s also the hitching, specifically when someone uses an smg in a close range battle. I’ve also heard people say it has happened with other weapons but I haven’t personally seen it.

If Epic truly cares about the toxicity of the game, it needs to handle things that breed toxicity. You cant scare people straight with bans either because bans are a broken system. The option needs to be taken away altogether.

Especially if you have multiple traps.

Full disclosure I play with standard controls on PS4. If this messes up other control schemes please let me know.

My idea is that when you are in build mode you can select traps the same way by hitting square. However, rather than a menu popping up have the normal build options get replaced with your traps. You can then toggle between them with triangle, and go back to regular build mode with square, or exit back to weapons with circle. This keeps everything on the HUD. You could even have a settings option to retain your previous trap selection so you can pre-select the trap you want.

Just some thoughts!

I kind of liked the fact that shields used to be sort of rare to find thus making the game a little more intense. Now it seems like in EVERY gun fight you have that enemy has a shield on and It kind of takes away from the Cat&amp;Mouse/Predator&amp;Prey aspect BR used to have. I like how bandages and Med Kits are now easier to find but I feel like having a shield(s) should be difficult to find like it was in the beginning. When literally everyone you’re fighting is able to get/find shields so easily (myself included) it makes me feel a little too safe??? If that makes sense, and in a BR kind of game that feeling of “safety” and security kind of ruins the whole vibe; And makes you less alert of your surroundings.

I hope what I wrote is making sense. Not saying that shields are bad to have and should be taken out of Battle Royale, but its when EVERYONE you come across has one on it makes it feel like everyone is the same; And you start to think less about things like “Should I try and take this guy out or let him pass” and “If I do Im gonna give away my position” You see? Having to think and make decisions based on you’re load out/health (wether is at 75 or 100) vs his doesn’t happen anymore because everyone (even me) feels “safe” running up and going at each other head on with the amount shields you find in the game now.

I don’t know if it just me but I liked the intensity Fortnite was when shields were hard to come across. After a good gun fight and you only have bandages and 75 health, That Cat&amp;Mouse kind of feeling where you turn around and check behind you every couple of feet because you were nervous/paranoid that someone is following you to the next circle. Now its like people are just running around carelessly because it’s so easy to find shields now vs how it used to be where everyone would question their movements and people would have to second guess trying to take out a enemy or not.",FortNiteBR

I had revived both teamkillers earlier in the match.,"Here's the story from start to finish. (I'd upload the video but PSN isn't working)

I spawn in and followed my teammates to the unnamed, northeaster corner of the map. One of our teammates gets downed and executed pretty quickly, but the rest of us survive a big battle and come out on top with good loot.

As we pass through Tomato Town we get attacked. It's a pretty even and heated battle, and both of my teammates get downed while two enemies are downed. I killed their last two standing players and revive the first teammate. As I revive the second teammate, the first immediately grabs up all the loot from the 4 dead enemies and makes no indication of sharing with me. I'm a little ticked but at least I have a green rifle and some ammo, and I'm too relieved to care. I t-bag near the loot-grabbing teammate in hopes he'll share, but I don't shoot or do anything like that. I decide to deal with it and go along.

As we head over to the next eye of the storm, my two teammates quickly exchange gear while I'm not super close by. It's extremely apparent that they're talking to each other outside of the game's voice chat. Again, I'm a little ticked but don't do anything that could possibly make them mad or harm our team.

At some point I shoot and kill a straggler that was closest to me, who had a blue rifle but nothing else special. I take the loot and both of my teammates make no indication that they want it.

As we get into the eye of the storm we take refuge an an abandoned house. From the roof we see a 4-man team running out of the storm, and we start shooting at them (They're very far away, at least 30 seconds sprinting distance). We down 2 of them before they start building, and they start building big. I get clipped by a few bullets and get downed, so I drop from the roof behind the house. Both of my teammates immediately stop shooting and drop down. 

One of them immediately finishes me off with his rifle before they shuffle through my stuff. The other guy makes no indication of surprise, again I'm positive that they're talking to each other. I keep watching and there's no enemies nearby, no reason that they couldn't have revived me. When they killed me there was 18 people left, and we were doing very good. They die a while later to a group of 4 people that had no chance against due to numbers rather than weapons.

Throughout the entire match, they made no attempt to express their disapproval or ask for anything. I did absolutely nothing to tick them off. When I got downed they saw that as an opportunity to kill me and take my mediocre loot. I was too stressed at the moment to report them, but I doubt Epic looks at reports anyway.

I'll try to upload the video later, but you know what happened. Epic needs to see this. Epic needs to punish teamkillers, especially ones that do so for no good reason, without trying to communicate with their teammates. While this is an extreme example, teamkilling is still very common, at least on PS4.

TL;DR I got executed by 2 teammates that were clearly in a party/talking to each other. I had revived both of them earlier. I did absolutely nothing wrong, and they didn't make any indication that they wanted anything from me.

83,jonovian13,1512967015,7izst0,11,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7izst0/weapon_switching_on_console/,0,Weapon Switching on Console,"I see that there has been mention of this before, but I really feel that it is something that should be addressed. I feel that switching between build modes and weapon slots is far too cumbersome on the console (I play PS4). At this point I have become fairly accustomed to hitting triangle enough times and looking at my slots to determine which item I am going to switch to, but despite me being used to it, there is still a very obvious limit on my ability to switch efficiently.  There are a few factors that make the current system especially difficult, and after watching a lot of computer players, it makes me upset that there is not a more efficient system in place. 

And yes, I understand that computer will always excel in this and other categories, but that does not excuse avoiding a couple simple fixes to this problem for console. 

To begin: the current cycling system is not entirely flawed, but it poorly executed. Multiple repetitions of a single button to cycle through the build modes (by default), is not very complicated. 2 things I can think of make it more complicated than it should be: cycling THROUGH the options as opposed to cycling left and right every time AND the fact that your inventory setup will change from game to game. With regards to the former and because of both, I am forced to glance at my bar to determine my selection as opposed to just being able to know instinctually. A simple fix for this is something like the combat pro layout, but even then, the latter issue still causes problems. 

To complete with the fluidity and function of the computer there should be fixed buttons for slots. My personal favorite being, 1-4 building slots on D pad (with circle remaining as build mode toggle. Square still works for traps and pads), slot 1 weapon on Triangle, and slot 2-5 weapons on D pad. Pickaxe should be switch to double tap triangle. This allows for quick and easier switching between ALL slots AND allows for more simplified customization for console players. 

On to customization, which is another major issue for console. The ability to quickly and easily pick the slot you want your weapon in is paramount for this system. Theoretically you could force PC players into cycling through their weapons, and they would still be better off with how quickly they can equip their weapons to whatever slot they want. For a game like this, where you never know what weapons you will get, this simple slot customization is necessary! In my opinion, there is a simple fix for console! HOLDING (for about 1 second) the respective button for the slot you want to move your EQUIPPED weapon to. Booyah?  Booyah! 

I understand that this is my personal preference, and I do not expect everyone to agree with my exact layout, but I think it would be liberating for most players. Past the specifics of the button mapping, I feel that some of my general suggestions would help simplify the process of allowing players to pick their own controller layout. You could even leave the option of weapon cycling or ""slot mapping"" in the options! Although, god knows why anyone would want to continue cycling through that....BAHAHAHA. To each their own. I hope that some of you agree and I hope that EPIC can look at this relatively simple, but serious issue, more seriously. 

Besides this issue I have felt no need to comment on anything else because I constantly see you guys improving the game and continuing to move in a very strong and positive direction. Continue the great work and thank you so much.",FortNiteBR

Plus, this also helps estimate travel time between two waypoints. I'm sorry if someone has posted something like this before, mods, feel free to take it down if thats the case. 

Please note that all this math was done using a base player speed of 5 meters per second which is the rounded down full player sprint speed in game. (tested in game actual sprint speed is closer to 5.76 m/s)

Time = Distance / Speed

For the sake of safety, we're going to round down the player travel speed from 5.76 m/s to 5 m/s to make sure we give ourselves a little wiggle room for hills/obstacles etc. 

The square size is 375m.  At a rate of 5 m/s that will bring us to 75 seconds or 1:15 to travel the length of a square on the grid. Now really this is about 65 seconds on a flat(ish) surface, but just in case we have to stop or have something to go around, its better to use the 75.

SO:

    1 square = 75 seconds = 1:15
    2 squares = 2:30
    3 squares = 3:45
    4 squares = 5:00
    5 squares = 6:15

    ¾ square = ~1:00
    ½ square = ~ 40 sec
    ¼ square = ~20 sec
    1/8 square = ~10 sec
    1/16 square = ~5 sec

Again I padded a few numbers and rounded a few down to adjust for up/down travel time, etc. But generally speaking that is how much time you'll have to give yourself based off of the fastest you can travel. I would suggest padding the numbers a bit more if you don't want to be in a dead sprint the whole time, but, being the procrastinator that I am, I just like knowing when the absolute latest I can move is.

Hopefully this helps someone out. If anyone would like edits or would like to suggest changes, I can't promise I'll get them done, but I'll try!

Either way, I’ll take it!! After struggling mightily to even make it to the end game for my first several weeks playing, over the last several days I’ve had almost as many top 25 finishes as not, quite a few top 10s, and 3 or 4 top 5 finishes, but couldn’t quite get over the hump. 

Now that I’ve got the one win under my belt, hopefully my next one can come in more exciting fashion with me actually landing the final kill... and hopefully it won’t take another 200 games! 😂",FortNiteBR

I’m on this game constantly, it’s my drug of choice, but with the queues yesterday and today coupled with not being able to join with my mates I had to turn it off! Not a biggie you would think, well, that’s were the problems began.

I had to go and sit with the person who also lives in my house (I think she’s called “the wife”?)! Well, at the time of switching Fortnite off, she happened to be watching Britain’s got X factor who can strictly dance whilst coming, or something like that. My poor eyes, fuck me they still hurt... Normally I’m shielded from such hideous tv as I’m playing your game, but I had to sit through nearly two hours off this nonsense. Plus I had the constant threat of her killing me if I didn’t “shut the fuck up or piss off back to the PlayStation” Please Epic, sort your selves out, if I have to watch anymore tv or sit in the same room as that woman... 

Then there are the kids! Or at least I think they are the kids, as they keep referring to me as “dad”!

A guy parachuting down and being shot at while he hasn't even landed yet, he could even die while still in the air.

So guns just need to be reloaded when they are first found, whether chest, house, or airdrop. Also, make the reloading slower on the first-time-reload. Because I find this unfair how you can shoot and possibly kill people still in the air.

I thought I'd share my opinion on some of the issues I have with 50v50, to show a differing opinion.

**1.  I feel like a snowflake in an blizzard**

I feel like my actions are basically irrelevant to the outcome of a match. Every game seems to just be a coinflip, regardless of how well or poorly I do. One game, I landed Pleasant Park all alone, and managed to take the entire zone, killing 9 enemies. If I took pleasant 9:1, then surely my team must have outnumbered the enemy at the other large locations, and taken them, right? 32:37. Winning a 1v9 is about as good as I can possibly perform, but it wasn't enough for us to win that game; my triumph was irrelevant.


**2. Ammo scarcity**

I have frequently run out of ammo in my sniper and my AR. The solution is be on the front line, so that when you wipe a group of 4-10 players, you can pick up the ammo.  Ignoring that I don't like to be on the front line with a sniper, I end up picking up multiple players ammo, and now I have 300 AR rounds. It seems to me that a small number of players on a team have more ammo than they could possibly use, and the rest have essentially none.

**3. Kill chasing**

Once you start winning, you get to a point where its 22:6, and if you want to get another kill, you basically need to break away from the group and hunt for the last players yourself. This generally leads to me getting 1v4ed, and I die. Alternatively, I can stay with the group to guarantee my survival, but then I only get 1 kill at most.

**4. Winning isn't special**
Solos is my favorite way to play BR. I have fun playing duos and squads with friends, but those wins aren't quite as rewarding as in solos. When you win in solos, you have beaten 99 other players for the championship, you overcame insurmountable odds to claim the W. Wins in games like Rocket League or Hearthstone aren't very special, because you win half your games. When you queue, it's basically a coin flip of whether you'll win or lose. In BR however, I queue *expecting* to lose, knowing that I'm only going to win every 10th game. When I finally do win, it feels fantastic.


I don't mind that 50v50 was added, and I'm glad that epic is offering some diversity of content for players to enjoy. Just because I don't like it, doesn't mean I'm not glad others can enjoy it; but I'm ultimately glad that it's going away instead of being a permanent playlist.",FortNiteBR

I myself prefer to play passive, and even though I maintain a higher win percentage than pretty much all of the aggressive players, the majority of them will talk shit about passive play, calling them pussies/bushwookies/trash players who have no skill whatsoever. Whatever insult they can usually come up with at the time, is the one they typically roll with. 

My argument back to them tends to typically be, well if you have 3x my kills and 2x my k/d, why do you win games at a lesser rate?

Most of the time I'll sit back and just enjoy the comments from some of the aggressive players, but I'd really like to know why they dislike the passive play so much?

Any aggressive players who would like to chime in here I'd really appreciate it.

[long],"I’m sitting on a high ridge, the sun setting, “BrodoSwagginz420” is setting up the last of our hilltop fortification. A man I had not met but fifteen minutes ago, now a brother in arms. After having survived the LZ and two skirmishes for munitions we had quickly established a bond. I wish I could say all was well, we lost good men in those fights. We were down to two members of our four-man squad. “Adaytofath0m” and “Racooonerz”. You will not be forgotten!

A woman brandishing a shotgun makes her way over the ridge, an ally in the remaining thirty members of our fifty-man army. Obviously the lone survivor of her squad, or perhaps a straggler. She’s mute,  the horrors she must have seen, but after a quick dance, we can tell shes still in the fight.

With gunfire in the distance, we climb the ramparts and prepare for the coming battle. A great storm billowing in the distance, its purple clouds fuming, turning with the crack of white lightning strikes. The storm while treacherous brings a greater terror, driving the horde of foes towards us. It funnels them into the valley below, like a horde of devious orcs….. with guns.

From the top of the rampart, I scream “This one’s for you Racooonerz!!” before launching a figurative tirade of rockets down into the horde. I hear a slight chuckle from Racoonerz in the wind, “Thanks dude”, no doubt watching our arduous struggles from the great beyond.

The hail of rockets while powerful do little to cull their numbers. Our mute friend slings grenade after grenade down the slope, most of them bouncing wildly to no avail. It seems she found them in the god damn rubber baby bouncy bumper store.

BrodoSwagginz420 calls out for more light ammo for his useless uzi before screaming out “INFILTRATOR!!” Everything goes slow, a shotgun blast rings, my shields dip, and I go tumbling off the fort and down the hill.

Crawling beneath a set of stairs after what seems like ages I’m on the throes of death. I call out to Brodo. “I’m under the stairs man, can you get me!?”

Alas, it was to no avail for Mr.Swagginz was no longer for this world.

The winds of the ether carried his voice. “My bad mate, I’m out. My mum made dinner so I’m cashing out anyways” in a second softer, angrier female wind I hear. “Jeramy get your arse down here and eat your bloody toad in the hole.

The world was becoming bleak, I laid there making my peace with the world. “If I had just checked my back more often, maybe I wouldn’t be here right now”. It was a sad quiet reflection that I’ve had many times in past lives.

When suddenly my mute compatriot dropped down, a silent angel, she quickly picked me up, even stopping to drop a few bandages before leaving cover to be sniped several steps out. She may have screamed, but I never heard it. RIP.

My cover exploded around me, shots fly overhead as I make a wild dash to safety. Darting in chaotic fashion I barely make it to a group of trees. Leaves falling in the gunfire, I quickly apply more bandages hoping that the tree remains standing long enough for me to heal. My literal last great white oak.

Checking the map a wry grin spreads across my face, a sea of green arrows is making its way to my position. One after another Battlebus army appears by my side. Steel walls go up immediately around my position.  A massive fort swells in all direction, rockets, guns, ring out at every level.

It was glorious, for the five minutes we reigned the battlefield. Our supremacy was not questioned, gods, throwing down bolts from our tower. It was hubris at its finest, quicker then she was erected though, the storm had swallowed her. Gone. Orphaned from the womb of our massives structure we drove straight to the heart of the beast.

Our numbers far superior, it was more of a slaughter than any sort of battle. We routed them from their base and made short work of the stragglers. with the remaining figures at twelve to three, we played a short game of cat and mouse in the dwindling eye of the raging storm to a quick victory.  ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪

An exploitative tactic in many first-person shooter (FPS) video games which involves a rapid succession of jumps, hopping like a rabbit to avoid enemy fire. 

It is a successful tactic mostly because these games do not often simulate the motion of human jumping very well, and it is an exploit difficult to correct from a developer's perspective without impacting other, more legitimate tactics.""

- Cannot switch to guns during the first two minutes of the game (this is recent after the patch)
- intense lag and framerate drop that was solved two patches ago. It has since went backwards. This is the biggest problem for me. I have great internet and I know it's not the problem) I don't care about all these fancy bells and whistles if the game cannot run properly.
- crazy aim assist after you down/kill someone...It pulls your screen down so hard. 
- still delay when you break an object. It's health will be empty but it is still up for around 3-10 seconds
- grenades disappearing still
- shotgun inconsistency (not console exclusive)
- guns are constantly empty after retrieving them from a chest. This has been happening since the latest update.
-one big complaint I have is how weird shooting through windows is. It's so inconsistent and weird? What's up with the red little marker (meaning it won't travel through) when your barrel is clearly not blocked?
-unable to pick some loot up from its spawn or off a dead body. May not be able to pick up at all, or may experience a big delay
- when building walls, bullets can go through them

If you have any suggestions or things that I am missing, please let me know so I can edit it in. This is already my favorite game of all time, and wish it could fullfil it's potential on console. Thank you. I would love for epic to get their eyes on this because I feel console players do not give enough feedback (unless it's about aim assist xD )

50 VS 50 is exactly what I've wanted from PUBG for ages, and I was really excited when I heard this game had that in it now! I immediately installed, which took overnight where I live.

As soon as I got into the game though, I am heavily disappointed. Instead of some epic 50 vs 50, I get discount PUBG squads. My teammates scatter to the four winds, and I'm left with no idea what I'm doing, not even an indication of the other 45 teammates existing. Literally - at that point it was discount PUBG solo. Might as well have been playing solo, because there wasn't any way to communicate with my squad or the other 40 or so dudes. Tried looting guns, and shooting people but it just felt like I had a nerf blaster. 


It really felt like they added 50 vs 50 just for the sake of saying ""hey, we're not PUBG guys!"", you know? I know I said it before, but it felt like discount PUBG squads. I didn't even realise there were 45 others on my team, because I could only see the three guys in my squad. What's the point in making such an arbitrary gamemode? It's super cool in theory, but why aren't both teams dispensed in the same place, rather than scattered in teams of 4? Like, on opposite ends of the island or something. Then place more of an emphasis on the base building too, because that felt rather pointless. The building is meant to be the distinguishing feature between this and PUBG, right??

I only really play PUBG when my friends are around for laughs, but nothing about this game was remotely fun. To top it off, some guy downed me and decided to start dancing instead of finishing me off (This is where I uninstalled lol). Not sure why a battle royale needs emotes but hey ho.

Such a shame, because the artstyle is so much nicer than PUBG.

I admit I only played 5 games, but honestly I only came for 50 vs 50 and that was disappointing enough without realising I couldn't play PvE without shelling out £20 for a game that gave a bad first impression.

Uhh... /end rant, I guess. What's your guys opinion on this? I just really feel they could have implemented a 50 VS 50 way better.",FortNiteBR

That being said, as a 35 year old gamer who has been playing every system since Atari, I can honestly say FNBR has captured my attention more than any other game this year. Hands down. 

I haven’t had this much fun with a game since Goldeneye on the 64. I tend to burn through games and replay value is pretty low typically but I just can’t put this game down. 

I initially heard about this game before Beta and when it came to the ps4, I was all in. Ultimate Super Founders pack. Something close to $300 has been spent, and not a single cent a regret as Epic has delivered week after week updates and new content. I even have 2,900 v-bucks waiting to be spent on new content as I anxiously  await the holiday stuff. Devs are active on social sites, and impress me more than any dev team in recent memory. 

So from someone who is absolutely hooked, thank you Epic for my game of the year. And to the reddit fam, happy holidays!

It started after one of the major updates (bushes), I believe.  I was mid-match when I became disconnected back to the menu screen with the generic ""you have been removed from the match for lag, VNP usage, or cheating, etc."".  To be clear, I have NEVER experienced any major lag (80mbps connection), NEVER used a VPN, and absolutely NEVER used any form of exploitation either in-game or via external programs (I'm not even a 'great' player that would be suspected of cheating).  When it happened, I wrote it off as the update perhaps causing some server instabilities and after getting the boot from 3 matches anywhere between 30 seconds into the match to 12 minutes into the match, I just hung up the towel..


I haven't even played Fortnite since then until last night, when 50 vs 50 was announced.  I updated the game, hopped into a match, and within 5 minutes got booted back to the menu yet again with the same generic message.. Aaarghh!  I exited, closed out all background applications (EVGA Precision, Steam, Battle.net, etc.) and tried several times with no resolution..  After searching online for those keywords, I found many other people are having this same problem and after opening a ticket got a response back regarding a '7 day IP suspension for suspicion of cheating / detection, etc.'.  WTF.  So, I opened a ticket to get my own response, and sure enough 2 days later, it came:


""If you were kicked from a match with a message regarding “IP, VPN, machine, or cheating” but are still able to launch the game, you are likely being removed from matches due to previously detected cheating behavior originating from this IP address.


This temporary IP kick will expire in 7 days from when cheating was first detected.""


A)  I don't really like that response, as my PRIMARY concern is IF I am suspected of cheating, it MUST be a false positive as it simply has not happened, 100% inaccurate detection.  


B)  Even ""IF"" someone has been suspected of cheating, the whole system they are using of 'blacklisting' an IP, allowing them to join games, then booting them during gameplay back to the menu with a generic message that doesn't clearly identify that they HAVE been suspected of cheating / warning them to stop, creates a lot of confusion.


C)  Unfortunately, it appears my IP ""IS"" in some sort of 'list' now, problem is, it most definitely is NOT clearing after 7 days.  I haven't played in weeks, logged in, and I am immediately booted.  That shouldn't be possible according to the response I received.


I mean, luckily, I haven't spent any cash (yet) in this game, but I've really enjoyed my time playing and would like to continue playing :(  I don't want to try and circumvent the problem by creating another account; not only does that seem dodgy, but it sounds like the ban is IP (EDIT: Or worse, registry) based so that's pointless anyway and may lead to me getting into more 'trouble' with Epic.  


I've responded to the e-mail with such remarks as well and asked that ""IF"" my IP is in any form of 'list' that it be revoked, but odds of that happening are slim-to-none, I bet.  I just want to bring attention to the problem, as I'm sure I am not the only one in this boat according to the online comments I've read.  I am a 100% normal (and not even 'great') player that has found myself blacklisted in a list that is NOT clearing after 7 days :(  Added to that, the frustration of being allowed into games, booted, and given a generic message leads to confusion...  Being a free-to-play game, I suppose it's easy enough to just bury suspected players into a deep pit and forget about them.  I mean, according to their response, they aren't trying to do that, and I  should be allowed back in 7 days, but that's obviously not working.. This is definitely not the proper way to handle this whole situation...

Epic was pulling the same shit EA did earlier this year and didn't face half the back lash for the same bullshit. 

Epic making and releasing the Battle Royale mode and going FTP was in direct response to what an initial failure Fortnite was as it was getting lambasted at release. 

While Battle Royale and the attention it gets is very fair please be aware this wasn't done out of love and passion for the gaming community or as an atonement for unethical business practice. 

**Epic is hopping on a trend and they want your money.**

Don't be fooled by friendly posts from Epic on Reddit and their constant attention to Battle Royale, it's all a ploy to distract from their initial failure and an attempt, albeit a fun one, at recouping from the botched release of Fortnite: Save the World earlier this year.

Edit: Maybe my words here are harsh but my over all point is that while Epic is moving in the right direction the were doing the same shady shit EA was six months ago so hold your horses before you call them best dev ever, like I've seen many do on this sub-reddit. 

Once again, EPIC IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I LIKE THEM RIGHT NOW but please reserve your judgement for when they truly prove themselves as competent developers and not just average.",FortNiteBR

Remove the storm already, it's making players restrictive and leads me to die.  This is soooo game-broking.

The map has FINALLY been reduced to only Loot Lake and everyones health is insta-death. Shield now takes 1 hour to give 1HP,  that still is one shot so it's balanced.

I was racking up 25 kills a game I managed to get 1 win and eventually I got bored. I just decided to boot the game backup because I had a BR craving. Now here is why I hate it.

Not really the main issue but it ties in with the second issue. FPS. I have a shitty laptop so with all settings on lowest and 720p I used to get 60fps. Now I have to optimize a bunch of things and only get 45. I don't care too much as long as the game is fun.

Here is the main problem. Now everyone is amazing at the game and or sweating their ass off tryharding. Before everyone was pretty chill not being to cheap and jump spamming. Now it's the same thing you sneak up on someone and manage to hit them once before they pull out the semi auto shotgun mash their space bar and kill you in 2 seconds. Players are so good and abuse every cheap thing that now I can't even kill anyone. I played a few matches and got 1 kill (out of all of the matches) and it was on someone without a gun. I got to 14th place but that was just because I couldn't find anyone and when I snuck up on a sniper he instantly turned around jump spammed and 2 shot me with his shotgun. I don't think it's just me being rusty as before I could always get at least 4 kills.

Hackers. A million of them. You are a mile away and a dude with a burst rifle insta kills you with 2 bursts leading every shot.  Nothing much can be done as that is just what happens with f2p.

You could choose wether to play safe and spawn back further (but get less opportunities for loot and kills), or spawn as close as you can to the enemy line where all the action (and death) is.

It would also create more scenarios where two even sized teams meet up and build 'two worlds' style bases across from each other for epic battles.

The busses could run at any random angle (as they do now), just parallel (and opposite direction) from the enemies' bus and I believe it would have this effect.

50/50 is fun, but it’s just Squads with a bigger team. I’d much rather see something as epic as the trailer with an almost instant all-out war.

Here’s how it could work: 

- Epic chooses a random spot on the map with medium sized circle (approx the third Circle). 
- Each team is instantly parachuted to THEIR side of the circle. 
- No team can see the enemy side of the circle as it’s separated by a huge storm wall. 
- Each team has 2 minutes to grab loot and build their fort(s).
- There are multiple extra caches of weapons around, and large bundles of materials. 
- There is a huge section of ground on both teams sides that indicates a good area for the massive fort. 
- forts can be built anywhere on each side but it’s a good guide to help keep forts in front of each other.
-  when the 2 minutes ends, a war-horn sounds and the storm wall fades, revealing each teams forts and players. 
- instant, mass mayhem ensues. 
- The storm is always moving a tiny amount for the rest of the game until it becomes the tiny final circle. This happens over a much longer timeframe, maybe 10-20 mins. ",FortNiteBR

I have no trouble tracking or hitting people, I am in more control of aim, and everyone seems to have a much harder time hitting me, which is great. Now I'm really not trying to say git gud but is this really that much of an issue?

(Suggestions included)","So I watched the trailer and I was incredibly pumped, however after playing a few games I'm somewhat disappointed.

I was expecting huge, epic battles between 2 teams in huge bases. In reality it's every man for himself (or a few small, unbalanced encounters) until the end, and by that point it's 20v4 and it's a simple steamroll, and building a base seems irrelevant. I've already won a few games without even seeing an enemy.

When it does get to around 15v15 and it's evenly matched it's fantastic, but this happens so rarely that I can't see myself choosing 50v50 over the normal modes.

Here's what I'd suggest to improve the mode:

Have 2 battle busses. One goes down the left side of the map (column B), with an entire team, one down the right side (F) with the other team. Both teams have an opportunity to jump out somewhere on their side (or the enemy side if they're suicidal), and loot up, as a team.

2 storms start on the left and right sides (in a straight line) and move inwards, eventually forcing everybody into the middle for a truly epic battle of 2 teams. Towards the end the storm can also come from top and bottom to reduce the size of the safe zone. You could stay back, play slow and loot up, or rush to the middle to build a base to hold off the enemies, or sneak around in enemy territory picking people off!",FortNiteBR

There are some attempts for a giant fort but the safe zone has a chance of removing it from play.

What I'm suggesting is a new mode where it's 50v50 but each team will spawn on either side of a plains and have chests available for each squad. About 150 materials (50w/50b/50m) per player so they can build a fort. There'll be a 90 second grace period where the teams can't cross over to each other or attack and will use that period to setup. 

Multiple air drops should be down the middle or the sides to incite more fights and to replenish weapons/ammo/hp etc.

I'm sure there are many other game mode suggestions popping up but I feel everyone was excited over the 50v50 trailer and the depiction of a full-on castle siege [(you can even see a team building walls + roof like a ram attack!)](https://youtu.be/sZcuF1T4Vxw?t=48).

Edit:
They should also guarantee in each squad at least a sniper, rocket launcher or grenade launcher. Each team should also have 2 jump pads and a number of traps. Also just give 1 squad all bushes for that epic trailer moment.

An idea for the circle is that at the start it grows in size allowing for more room to move, loot and gather resources. After about 8 minutes or something the circle should start shrinking back normally but at a rapid speed.",FortNiteBR

But, I feel that after playing a few games, it somewhat lacks what most of us hope for when queuing up. I could be speaking only for myself here, and if so I am sorry, but I think this game mode should end in an all out battle.



**My Issues with the Mode**



I could be completely wrong here, and if so, down vote me into oblivion, but I think that this game mode should be an all out war between both teams that culminates in one giant end game battle. Instead though, it plays out as squads taking out other squads and then finishes in a man hunt of 20 people on one team trying to finish off 2 or 3 on the other team. It could happen every now and again where the end game is an even 15v15 or 10v10, but I don't see that happening often. 



**Possible Format for new 50v50**



* Begin with two busses, each with one team of 50, flying parallel to each other on the left and right side of the map. For example, Team A's bus would start in B1 and fly to B7, while Team B's bus could start in F1 and travel to F7, or something of the sorts. Yes, players could still drop and fly towards mid map, but it would make it rarer to have early game kills. 
* Make it so that until a certain time, say 3 minutes, Team A can't travel to Team B's side of the map. Could make it so that if a member of Team A ventures into Team B's half, they take progressive damage similar to being in the storm. 
* Have the actual storm periodically or continually moving in bringing both teams toward the center of the map to make a fair final zone for both teams.



**Final Thoughts**



Again, I just want to thank EPIC for going out of their way to bring this game mode to the community. It has been asked for in other Battle Royales but never implemented. EPIC games is the studio we wish all of our favorite games were produced by (Coming from a former Halo and H1Z1 player).



I know EPIC stated that this is a limited time game mode, but with some fine tuning I think that this mode could become a fan favorite and hopefully they would think about keeping it as a full time game mode. 



If anyone else has any other ideas, or critiques of what I suggested that would be appreciated.

For instance, knowing what weapons he has, how much building material he has, how many bullets he has and how many kills he has would make it a lot more interesting to spectate players.

If someone amazing kills me, I would love to know if he's been slaying half the server up until killing me, or even if it's a bush-camper that just went to stretch his legs for a minute. Also, knowing what weapons, building material and how much ammo the player has allows for the spectator to learn something from the person who bested them.

Additionally, I'd love for the spectator mode not to be so ""snappy"", for a lack of a better word. Anyone who's ever spectated someone knows what I'm talking about here. I'm no programmer, so maybe there's a good reason why it's like it is, but I'm just saying.

It would also be great if you could scroll through all the remaining players - I don't see an obvious reason as to why you can't when you (and your team) are dead(?) Feel free to enlighten me here. While we're at the subject, it would be nice to have the scope bug fixed. The one where you spectate a teammate, then he dies while scoping or you jump to the next teammate and the scope's still there.

All this said, the game is amazing, the devs are amazing and I can't wait for what's to come. These are merely the few things I can think of that I'd like to see in the game.

This brings us to today and an update is released and so many people instantly grab their pitchforks and torches and just light them up and I just don't feel like Epic deserves that.  The patch definitely caused some issues and I am sure it is a matter of time before Epic responds.  Without a doubt they are listening, gathering information and accessing the situation.

The changes to general sensitivity would’ve been easier if my settings didn’t remain the same yet feel different but overall that can be adjusted. 

Perhaps auto aim needs to be fine tuned just a tad more, but I would take this current auto aim over the previous clunky magnet anyday, although being pulled towards a dead body / loot needs to be sorted but I’d assume that’s a bug 

I’d caution epic not to perform a knee jerk reaction to the knee jerk from this subreddit over the sensitivity. Yes it feels faster, but also more fluid just lower the values and it’ll be fine. 

I’d like to be able to keep a sensitivity through multiple patches though.

It's purely based on javascript and I would really appreciate anyone that wants to check it out. I've got a live version over at [Github pages](https://cbrasser.github.io/dropMe).

In the normal mode it just gives you a random spot to drop, it should not hit any water since i'm sampling the color values when i generate a spot, it might do that occasionally though. 

If you hit POI only mode it will only give you locations on the map that are either labeled or have a lot lof loot anyways. I will probably add some more points to that list later!

Last but not least if you check the flight route checkbox you get a start and endpoint to set your flight route really quick, as well as a slider to set the max flight range you are willing to take. You can also combine both flight route and POI mode! :D

The dragging of the endpoints is a little bit laggy right after start up, give a few seconds &amp; just dragg it around abit, after that it's really smooth! I will also try to fix that later on.

If you want to check out the [source code](https://github.com/cbrasser/fortniteDropMe) that would be really awesome! :D

Things i love:

+ New footstep sounds ( absolutely amazing! )

+ New consumeable sounds

+ New inventory

+ The aiming and lack of aim assist

+ Endgame stats

Things i dislike:

- With the decreased aim assist mouse and keyboard gain more advantage imo

- Renegade Raider skin has visual bug in the back of helmet ( Literally unplayable )

- The trap warning sound is too intrusive for traps to be of more use then they were.

- Had a chest that kept the unopen animation for well over a minute. Then the sound happened and it opened visually.

Land somewhere, try to avoid fights at all costs. Find as many shields as you can, preferably full shield with 2 extra. Find a decent AR, shotgun and a longrange weapon. Then go camp in a corner until the endgame. This strategy is undeniably the best one with how shields currently work as there are rarely any shields to be found around the map late-game. So what ends up happening (at least in most of my games) I land somewhere, kill everyone i see in the town until theres no one left, and I leave the town with 75 hp and no shield but with 10 kills. That doesn´t feel rewarding at all, and it feels like I´ve made a bad play, i always get the feeling of ""Damn, should of just bailed the city and camped as soon as I got my full shield"".

Im guessing alot of you will pull the ""But its a BR game, its about being the last one alive. its not TDM"" card. But let´s be completely fuckin honest, is it REALLY any fun to sit in the basement of a house for 10-15 minutes straight just camping it out? I just want some kind of reward for getting alot of kills. And yes you do get their loot, but the chance of them carrying extra shields is crazy low and never actually worth the risk/reward.

My suggestion is, each kill you get has a chance of giving a slurp/shield (Regardless if the player you kill is actually carrying a slurp/shield) and for each kill you dont get one that chance increases until you do, and then it resets. Or something along those lines.. Another suggestion could be having airdrops have a 100% chance of dropping shield(s).

I am a console peasent, but I still play on the PC (PS4 got stolen, long story). Since I suck with mouse and keyboard I try to incorporate a controller with every game I play. Some games is impossible to play with a controller on PC, even for a console peasent ehm CS GO.

Fortnite however worked just fine. I was able to perform well with a controller. I did decent with mouse and keyboard, but aim is something that will take me years to improve with. I thought it was fair as aiming long range was difficult and same with at really close range, meaning that it only helped with medium range. I still did better with a controller because thats what I was used to. Being able to compete with people on PC was a godsend, but this lates update has made things confusing.

First game I entered I knew they had ""improved"" aim assist. They stated that they removed it, which was kind of concerning, but also that they updated it. I landed in a house, got some good loot and went in to fight. As soon as I aimed in the reticle went all over the place and I immediatly died. I was so confused. The sensitivity has been greatly increased. Increasing sensitivity is alright, but they removed aim assist meaning it made me spin out of controll. I couldnt get the sensitivity right. I didnt change it earlier and kept it on default, but now its impossible to get it to a fine medium. Is it too much to ask for a default setting like Call of Duty games has? It seems like they are treating controller with the same ""respect"" as mouse and keyboard. I dont know what they did to the aim assist. Lack of a training range makes it difficult for me to test it without being in game fighting people. I cant seem to get used to this. What did they do? Its not like they completely removed aim assist either, it just feels really off. Why would you try to fix something that nobody complained about?

*For PC master race kind unaware of what aim assist does. There are two types of aim assist. One that autolocks to players and another that slows down. Autolocking doesnt mean soldier 76 hacks. Your reticle has to be close to the enemy before starting to aim. Depending on the game the area of where the reticle is can be big and or close to non existent. A big area tend to confuse people as the reticle suddenly flicks over making you lose awareness. Thats why you need a medium. Fortnites aim assist could be admittely generous on medium ranges, but on close range it was almost non existent. 

The second type helps with long range. It doesnt autolock and instead makes it so the reticle moves slightly slower once its on an enemy. Again, you would have to know how to aim with the controller to do good. The reason controllers needs aim assist is because it can be harder to get precicion with a controller compared to mkb. This is a fact. You can say that concole peasents are so bad that they need aim assist, sure, let me see you trying to aim with a controller. If aiming with mkb is easier then just stop using a controller. No, as mentioned earlier. Precicion is easier, but for people used to controllers it takes a while to transistion. There are plenty of people like me who arent dedicated enough to get good with mkb. To most of us it feels off. Controller support is needed for people like us.

Just a reminder to visit /r/FortniteRoyaleLFG to find friends! Enjoy, folks! It’s been a long wait, but we can finally enjoy Duos. Please direct all discussion here, as to avoid duplicate posts.

&gt; Hey friends,
Sorry for lack of heads up on this, but final plans got solidified and executed late last night. We didn't want to announce this as incoming     until we were 100% sure it all worked as expected. Basically, Duos should now be available in OCE, ASIA, and Brazil server regions during their respective ""peak hours"". Each region has a slightly different overall curve from peak to offpeak due to geo/timezones and such, so that total available time range might look a little bit different from region to region.

&gt; We will be keeping an eye on this and tweaking as needed. Ideally, we want to keep expanding the time range that Duos is available.

&gt; Here are the time ranges per region where duos should currently be available:

&gt; Oceania 12:00 AM - 7:30 AM EST // 5:00 AM - 12:30 PM UTC
Asia 3:00 AM - 1:00 PM EST // 8:00 AM - 6:00 PM UTC
Brazil 9:00 AM - 12:00 AM EST // 2:00 PM - 5:00 AM UTC

&gt; Thanks for your patience on this. I know this has been a pain point for folks and it took us longer than we'd like to get a solution in place that would be a net positive outcome.

Have fun!",FortNiteBR

I really like the developers how hard they work and how much effort they put into this game. Aside from this they listen to us and always up date us when something is being done or about to get done.

Hence I support the game! I do this by purchasing skins. However I feel like I get too few for the amount of money I am paying for.

E.g. You see a nice skin which looks like a normal skin that costs over 1400 vbucks. Well you cannot buy the 10 euro vbucks but you gotta buy the 25 euro ones because that gives you enough vbucks where the 10 euro one is just insufficient.

Why dont they make the skins like LoL?
Normal skins with minimal effort cost around 5 or even less euros. Legendary skins cost more or around the 10 euros.

This would make it so much better. Perhaps more people might buy skins and support the game.

I paid 25 for pubg, for a whole game. Which is the same amount of money for 2 skins in fortnitebr which is absurd in my eyes.

You get 1 point per kill, 3 points for being last man standing, 2 for second to last standing, and 1 for not dying first. 

Most points at the end of the round wins. It’s stupid, but entertaining. Drop points are usually pleasant park, flush factory, moisty mire, and wailing woods. 

We rotate the drops to we don’t always go to the same place. It’s a balance between surviving longer or being more aggressive for points.

[The Debate Topic] - [Popular Sub Opinion] - [My opinion]. I don't need validations just a summarized post to see who's on what page around here.

1) KB/M on Console - Should be removed - I disagree, I think skill &gt; input device, unpopular but ok.

2) Put Console KB/M Players in a separate lobby - General impression is that its a great idea - Personally, I think anyone who is moaning about it still has never actually tried it themselves, it really is not that great and overblown.

3)The direction of the game - People are hoping more competitive - This is the real point as to why I made this post.

I think, IMO, maybe they're taking it in the direction of a *fun* game? This ties in a lot with the RNG - another hot topic , and here's how: 

The RNG is what gives the filthy casuals like myself a chance to win, even if it is by fluke. 
A lot of competitive gamers frown on RNG because it does not allow them to guarantee certain factors with their skill.

The RNG is what makes every match a surprise, a new experience, a new mistake to learn from. At the end of the day,a better player will still win, but there is that chance, and I think a lot of people like myself with 100+ games and 0 wins cling to this hope.

Epic is going for a game that can be enjoyed by all, like the Nintendo Wii's Original Vision. If it does lose popularity, it will either be from a stupid mistake on Epic's part and be devastating, or the more competitive players will see this is a game about fun, not who's best and use their discretion to keep playing or not. Nothing wrong with that. 

My concluding 2c is that this game only needs content additions along with the usual slight improvements, I can see the massive shipments of content potential in yonder horizon.

**TL;DR - With things like RNG, who cares if you use a keyboard?**

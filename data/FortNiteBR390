When you have this in your inventory, you should...

1.  Be perfectly quiet while slow crouch walking.

2.  Not make a sound reloading or switching weapons.

3.  Make less sound while running.

4.  Make significantly less sound while building.

It should take up an inventory slot so you can only carry 4 items while you have it.  Also, shooting weapons shouldn't be any quieter.",FortNiteBR

Heres a list of what should be brought up in order of importance:

* hit detection is messed up, either the bullets never hit or never miss (I understand there is rng to the shooting but 3 dead on shots seems a bit too common now)
* There are instances of shots hitting people around corners
* Shotgun damage feels very inconsistent
* The pump should not be able to one shot someone at 200 health and has a deadly range farther then it should be
* Gold weapons are gold for a reason so why are they spawning on the ground
* The auto build is a bit balance breaking and ends up turning fights into breaking the same wall over and over
* RPG's should have a reduced damage to people, rpg spam at the ground almost always win the last 1v1

I can't be the only one who has been noticing these things as being a possible issue? Let's talk about fixes and not just complain. But give a good idea on how to balance this out.

If youre in the middle of the bell curve you might not notice anything but any higher skill player out there is noticing that the quality of opponents and matchmaking times have gone waaaaay up. No, it's not because magically overnight everyone got gud all at once, that's not what happened.

Also, sorry if this isn’t the place to rant. I’m new to Reddit and am still trying to figure out the boundaries of it. 

I don’t care what anybody says, I HATE shotguns in this game. The pumps are ridiculous. I don’t like how epic only nerfed the fire rate of double pump, because it still only takes 1-2 shots to kill someone. I’m not exaggerating when I say that *every single game* I get killed by a shotgun. I think it’s absolutely ridiculous that I can have full health and shields and get one shot by a shotgun. There’s absolutely no need for a headshot multiplier, and personally I believe it is very much a crutch weapon. Epic has done a good job of adding a TON of great weapons to the game, but yet everyone still uses shotguns and relies on them. I don’t think there should ever be a crutch weapon. Id be willing to be money that half the players that win games with shotguns would stop winning games if they were nerfed, because they never practice with other guns. And this is coming from someone who is an above average player, who wins quite often. Or at least I used to until the shotguns became meta. 

Sincerely, someone who loves the game, but is just upset that it’s hard to enjoy right now. ",FortNiteBR

The first shot fires a green pump shot and then it will shoot purple tac shots until the pump is done pumping and then it fires the pump gain.

It does not need tac shots in between to fire the pump. It fires the pump whenever it is done pumping.

This would be better than a green pump purple tac combo and it would only take one inventory space.

I can't even believe that it's as good as it is, and is free on top of that.

But I just can't stomach spending $20 dollars on ONE skin. Not even a pack of skins or combining the skin with a pickaxe and an emote or anything like that. Just one single skin for $20. 

I get it, they need to make money and all that I have to do is not buy them and it won't affect me, but it got me to thinking. If skins were $2-3 each, I would absolutely end up spending way more than $20 in a heartbeat. It's easier to handle if I am getting multiple items for that price, but then I feel like I am getting a good value, as well.

They wouldn't have to all be epic or legendary skins for that low of a price, those could still be like 5 bucks instead of 20, but maybe ones that are a little less fancy could be those cheaper ones. I do know that they have some of the older common looking ones that are cheaper, but those are still 5 or so dollars in v-bucks each.

I propose a solution, add a landing strip and making it like a airport, it would not only help shift players away from Tilted, but it would keep the area similar combat wise by having long lines of sight encouraging building. It is arguably the weakest looting spot on the game AND it's marked.

Like, I understand you want to perfect it or something before releasing it but that’s the whole point of the test, so the community can play while you adjust, what’s the point of keeping it a secret.

Why can’t you release it and adjust it as people play? 

And for future reference you guys need to start having test servers before releasing things on live and making everyone wait a week on the off chance that things aren’t working as intended or just feel wonky, and by the recent track record something is always broken with each new addition. No one likes the Deagle and no one likes the Hunting Rifle.

Now almost all of Epic (600 employees) has some link to the game, which has been out for 7 months.

I don't want Epic to add an additional map.  I want them to scrap the current map and take all the knowledge they've aquired over the past 7 months to make one map to the best of their abilities.

Now that Epic has sunk their teeth into Battle Royale I think they know enough about the genre to make a great map.

Things they could improve for Map 1.0:

1) The water should act like water.  Right now Loot Lake is a placeholder puddle and the river is a looney toons tunnel (serves no actual purpose)

2)  The northern parts of the next map could be snowy.  The middle parts could be grassland.   The southern parts could be desert.

3)  We're starting to get a bunch of player mobility items like the Impulse Grenade and the Jetpack.  Map 1.0 should have some harder chokepoints.  Maybe the next map should consist of 2 large islands where we have to build over the gap to reach the other side?

4)  There are still too many placeholder buildings.  Only use those where it makes sense (for example in neughborhoods and a few gas stations)

The first map was fine but I think Epic could do waaaay better and I think we'd all rather have 1 amazing map than 1 amazing map and 1 ok map.

Get on it Epic!

Quick disclaimer, you may thoroughly enjoy using a gun I don't rank very highly, but that doesn't make it the best in the game. I will be ranking guns on how well they perform their job, and while some may be very fun to play with, they may not generally rank very high. It does not mean they are unusable, simply not quite as good. I'm also not going to mention rarity. Let's get into it.

1. The scar/m16. Dps, accuracy, range, headshots. This gun is stacked with features and generally dominates the other guns. The ability to deal with multiple enemies and outgun most guns up close. Insta pickup if you don't have it. 

2. Rocket Launcher. I really don't need to explain this. It's perfectly accurate, does insane damage. Can be rode over large gaps, and is much less ammo intensive then other options. People say it's unreliable at close range and is too dangerous, well that's kinda the point.

3. Bolt action rifle. One taps, one taps are amazing. This gun has the damage to insta down a non shielded enemy, and can one tap with a headshot no matter how many shields or what distance. Learn this gun, carry it.

4. Tac shotgun. Really came into its own after double pump got remove. One can argue carrying a pump smg combo is better, but this gun is the best single slot close range weapon if you only have one slot. 

5. Minigun. It's not here really because it's earned it, the only reason it's here is because it can level bases faster then any other weapon without sacrificing the ability to use up close. It has the major downside of leaving you vulnerable during use. Note that picking it up without more then 2-3 hundred small ammo is pointless.

6. Silenced pistol. I think the next two weapons can be interchanged depending on what you want. If you are down your teammates and plan on dealing with enemies up close and need to kill them asap, the silenced pistol can do it for you. Not much more to say, you have to aim well.

7. Tac Smg. It's better at a longer range then the silenced pistol, has the highest dps in the game making it great at destruction, and can insta nuke with headshots. Depending on what you are usin it for it can be number 6.

8. Scoped ar. I'm going to add this with a disclaimer. If you don't have good backup weapons like a m16 and shotgun, this gun will be almost pointless. It's dps is painfully low, but it can reliable plonk away at health from a mile away, and in even team fights or long distance 1v1s this can be very powerful.

9. Standard pistol/silenced smg. These are going in the same spot because they fill the same role. Use until you find the objectively better tac smg and silenced pistol. They are totally viable to spray down up close, will lose to their older brothers and shotguns usually.

10. Grenade launcher. It's a spam explosive weapon. It does it's job, and in teamfights can be very powerful. But the problem is that to be its most effective it needs a metric ton of ammo.  I could see people placing this higher, but since it's found so late it's a bit easier to build around then the highly accurate launcher. I could be argued into placing this higher though.

11. Burst ar. I'm going to get a lot of people very mad at me for this. But the burst ar really gets hurt with weapon bloom. It's not great against structures, often the second and third shot will miss in the burst at ranges, and if you aren't hitting the head it will feel like a peashooter. Another gun with a disclaimer, there is a distance right outside of shotgun range where the accuracy is good enough to land a full burst. A triple headshot can nuke, but this is not a reliable method of damage and as such will always pale in comparison to the m16/scar platform.

12. The deagle. Only lands itself here because of its ability to corner check and because it uses sniper ammo. Since we've gotten this far and the only sniper we've seen is a single shot weapon, you will have a ton on hand. Meaning you should always be able to spam this if needed. Still not worth holding onto very often, but it's defiantly usable. 

13. Revolver. The deagle, but with less damage and a less desirable ammo type. Really not worth carrying at all. 

14. Semi auto sniper. This gun is ruined by shields. And moving enemies. And building. You know how satisfying it is to hit someone with a bolt? Now you have to hit them twice to three times. Only time I carry this is if I'm in snipers only and need to destroy bases.

15. Hunting rifle. You can corner check with it. Maybe mid range rapid peek sniping if you are really really intent on using this gun? It's bad. Not much more too it. 

16. The crossbow. It's a good thing this is silenced, that means enemies can't track the dozen or shots you missed. And when you hit him? Whelp he had shields. Let me hit 3 more shots. Massive drop, slow velocity, crappy damage for a sniper. It's pointless. It's honestly kinda angering me talkin about it. You can't hipfire it up close, it's unusable at close range period, it's unusable at long range, and its outgunned by every ar and sniper at its optimal range. There ONLY time it can work is if you are bush hiding and really want to commit on being stealthy. 


So that's the rundown. I'm always happy to discus this, but again I have to remind y'all that being cool doesn't make it good. 





Hahaha didn't list the pump shotgun! Gotcha! Personally I don't think the pump works. Either you get a headshot where you insta kill up close, making it by far the best cqc weapon. Or you have to actually shoot someone anywhere else, in which case it's the worst. Personally I believe this gun should be removed and reworked somehow.",FortNiteBR

This is the guy you put all of your faith into. He's the one calling the shots, like where to land, where enemies are, where to rotate to etc. Expert shooter and pro builder, you'll do anything to keep him alive because if he goes down, you all go down.

**The Strategist**
Essentially the left hand man of The Captain, the strategist is all about.. well, strategy. He's always coming up with different base designs, weapon combos, and combat strategy. When approaching enemies, he'll usually hang back and try to flank them or get the initial jump on them. 

**The Rambo**
This guy is out for blood. His first instinct when he sees a squad of 4 is to shoot. Likewise, he won't stop shooting until either they're all dead or he is. His inventory is usually strictly weapons, especially a minigun and some form of explosives. Although his play style seems barbaric, it works great for striking fear into your enemies. 

**The Decoy**
Every squad has one. It isn't his fault, he just hasn't clicked with the game yet. Can't shoot, can't build, always falls short of where you're dropping, and for some reason is carrying 30 bandages and one mini shield.  While he may seem like a burden most of the time, he will always remind you of that one clutch moment he had where he killed those 2 guys at Fatal Fields. His primary function is to be the first to walk across an open field, just to see if it's safe for the rest of you.

I always used pump/tac shotgun. Recently after this patch it hasn't done anything to my play style except one thing. I will pump then change to the tac and the pump will show the hitmarker but do 0 damage at all. I then switch to my tac but I lose every time because I already exposed myself unless I rebuild but even then I'm at a disadvantage. it's rage inducing and making me want to switch to primarily the tac which I do NOT want to do. I play on XBOX never had a problem with this before. it's basically making the pump not usable at all unless you primary it. However I watch every PC player switching from Pump to tac in a millisecond with every shot hitting. It's honestly pissing me off to the core. It's ruining my play style.

Looking into further the matter, the official Epic Games website lists the recommended specs as:


System | Recommended Level
---|---
GPU | Nvidia GTX 660 or AMD Radeon HD 77870 equivalent DX11 
VRAM | 2 GB
Processor | Core i5 2.8 GHz
RAM | 8 GB
OS | Windows 7/8/10 64-bit
With the Minimum System Requirements being:

System | Minimum
---|---
Graphics Driver | Intel HD 4000
Processor | Core i3 2.4 GHz
RAM | 4 GB
OS | Windows 7/8/10 64-bit + Mac OSX Sierra
Meanwhile my iMac's specs are as follows:


System | Spec
---|---
Processor | 2.9 GHz Intel Core i5
Memory | 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3
Graphics | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M 512 MB
OS | macOS Sierra
Yet the computer still struggles to run FortNite. So either I'm mentally handicapped or the minimum specs need to be increased. If it is indeed the more likely second option, could someone please help me and explain what's I am doing wrong and IF there is a way to fix it?

It's unique, has gotten me playing with friends again and it's just a hell of a lot of fun when it's running smoothly.  That being said, I've been pretty vocal on here about the fact that the game's devs are focusing too much on new content ($$$) and not focused enough on fixing all the bugs.  Despite an aggravating glitch here or there, it was still fun though, so tonight I went ahead and bought the Season 3 Battle Pass.  And I have to say, after buying the pass, I feel nothing but regret.

As someone who was calling for the devs to step their shit up before we went putting our money in their pockets, I feel like a total hypocrite for buying the pass.  I didn't really care much, because it was only $10, but holy shit guys.  I just played about 10 squad matches in the past 2 hours or so.  That glitch where you lose one of your weapons and can only hold 4 items - it happened in EVERY SINGLE GAME.  The last game I just played ended for me when an enemy came gliding through a doorway, no guns in hand.  I lit him up and got the hit marker on him, but none of my shots registered and my health dissolved out of nowhere.  It's pretty funny that as soon as I bought the pass, the game actually, finally became unplayable.  This is definitely the universe's way of punishing me for not sticking to my guns.  And yeah, it's only $10, but damn, this shit needs to change.  

Because of Fortnite's explosion in popularity, the devs are getting away with bullshit that would never fly if this were a paid game.  They get away with it because its ""free"".  Yet Epic is making a massive amount of money because of poor schmucks (like myself) who wanted a different skin.  I hate to say that I am part of the problem now for having given them my money.  But I'm not giving another damn penny to Epic and I'm calling them on their shit.  This post will likely get buried, but I'm going to keep voicing my opinions and hope that the community gets it through their heads that if we want a playable game, we need to stop throwing money at Epic.  I'll keep checking in and playing to see if this situation improves, but until then I'm not letting Epic 
have another penny and I urge you to consider doing the same.",FortNiteBR

Inconsistency and the fact that the entire premise of the weapon is completely missed. 

To start with the elephant in the room, the rocket launcher. Player to player damage is heavily inconsistent and leads to situations where you can land a rocket dead center mass and do no damage. In other instances players can shoot the ground and kill an enemy player and not themselves. Player to player damage needs to be more consistent and really show that the weapon can kill, as it should be able too. Along with this rockets need more player to structure damage. This really emphasizes the use of steal in the end game for structure placement. This may all sound like one big buff coming to the most crutch weapon in the game, however to balance all of this out, lots of changes need to be made to the core mechanics and principle of the weapon. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD A ROCKET LAUNCHER BE USED AS A SHOTGUN. The reload speed on the rocket launcher should be increased from what it is currently to nearly 3 times its reload speed. It is a power weapon, used to dish out heavy damage, similarly like he pump or bolt action sniper. It should not be a spam weapon. In the current setup, rocket launchers take no skill. As both a user and someone on the receiving end of this weapon it’s flat out ridiculous. It should be a weapon that fires once to start a fight and should take 3+ seconds to reload to not encourage the continuous spam. This would over all balance the weapon, and return it to its core purpose. If they where to keep it at its current state, then surely it needs a damage reduction. 


As for the grenade launcher. Often overlooked, this weapon is by far the best in the game. With its heavy ammo economy and high spam effect, it’s incredibly hard to counter this weapon, even while building as much as you can. It straight needs a nerf. Lowered magazine, longer reload, larger blast radius. While it is very rare to see one used in end game, in the hands of someone who isn’t brain dead it’s a god tool. Not nerfing it into the ground while taking steps to balance it, would surely help the life of them game.

If I recall it was 150 for a specific mode or 250 across all modes.  This is something that most people can achieve in a handful of games.

There's daily challenges that require you to live to place top X for Y number of times.  The solo one I remember was top 50 for 5 times.  That's relatively reasonable as well.  If you really want, you can even drop in an unpopulated area and wait it out.

There are weekly challenges that, thus far, require you to eliminate 3 players with a restriction.  However, they're flagged as ""hard"" on the challenge list and reward 10 stars instead of 5.  You can also complete them any time after they become available and there's no real penalty for that as they don't take up a daily challenge slot.

With all this in mind, the generic eliminate 10 opponents daily challenge seems a little out of whack.  It's true there's no restrictions on it, so that does offer a lot more opportunities for completion.  It's also true that maybe I just need to ""git gud"". 
 However, 10 eliminations seems very high to me compared to other daily and weekly challenges.  Maybe it would make more sense if it was lowered to 7 to line it up with the daily challenge for number of games played, or lower it to 5 to line it up with daily challenges to place top X.

Thoughts?

Edit: For those commenting that 10 eliminations is too easy, that's certainly a valid opinion and one that I can respect, but that's not the point of this question.  This is about whether 10 eliminations is out of alignment with other challenges *as they exist today*.

Keep in mind that if someone is getting 1-2 eliminations, then it's entirely possible that those 1-2 people are getting 0 for the round.  That makes the effective average 0.5-1 eliminations, or 10-20 games.  Compare that to other daily challenge requirements.",FortNiteBR

I just think you should be able to shoot through player crafted walls/ramps until the building animation is complete. And as soon as the animation finishes, it becomes the barrier that we have in game now. I'd even be fine with an increased building animation speed, but just for the first 2-3 seconds you should be able to shoot through without bullet collision. And also, keep the instant collision for players, so you can still immediately walk on crafted walls/ramps as soon as you place them down.

I think it’s ridiculous that a player caught off guard in an open field can immediately lay down a barrier. Part of the tactics in this game is building a fort to hold down a position... not to spam walls that act as immediate barriers.

And before you say “well you can shoot to break them down” I argue that unless you run out of building materials, or unless the enemy has a rocket launcher, you can out build anyone trying to shoot the walls down.",FortNiteBR

One solution would be to not allow teams of 3 to select ""Fill"". This usually results in them being toxic towards the solo player, they will blame him for everything negative that happens and generally be toxic towards him (on CSGO this happens a LOT). Or at least inform them they must speak English and make sure they don't have annoying background noise if they use open mic.

in real life, the biggest cities would be right next to a large body of water to allow for ships to transport goods. Now I know this is a video game so realism should not be a priority over fun. I think it should be moved though since I think way too many people land there right now and none are really punished in anyway.

I like the big city, but overall I think it is bad for the game. If it were moved to the edge of the map, it will be harder to get to the circle making it more of a deterrent.

There is such a large map with unique locations and having most of it be empty now since the tilted update is upsetting to me. My goal in this post is to start a discussion on how we can get a better spread of player drops since right now I think there are too few hot spots.

side note: wailings woods challenge was probably made to get people to land in another spot. I wouldn't be surprised if in the next challenges was something like land on the coast X times. or something to do with haunted hills.",FortNiteBR

The most important item in our arsenal is smoke grenades, and as many as possible. The next best thing is a bush or two, and excusively silent weapons, especially crossbows.

After getting those supplies, we begin the hunt. When searching for a target, we want someone unexperienced and more likely to make mistakes. Many people look for default skins, but we’ve learned over time that what you want to look for is default *pickaxes*.

Upon finding our delightful targets, we choose one to silently take down. This is where the crossbows come in. We down one and kill him. Naturally his teammate will begin to panic and expect an attack, but there wont be one.

Only a smoke grenade.

Not even on him, but just on the ground nearby. Then we vanish. Afterwards, we quietly stalk him. This part can challenging, but hills definitely work for hiding while also peeking on him.

Every time he goes inside of a house or anywhere that will prevent him from seeing, we throw a smoke grenade. He needs to know that we’re always watching. He needs to be afraid.

But what happens when he encounters enemies? This is a battle Royal game after all. We become his angels of death. Nobody is allowed to touch our prey except for us. Strangely, we find ourselves better at the game when we’re doing this than when we actually play to win. 

Now unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Eventually when our prey discovers us, we slaughter him without hesitation. Most likely, new players will spectate the person that kills them. At this point, we stand with our backs facing eachother, about three paces apart, so that from the spectator will see the face of the person that didn’t kill them. That person will give a quick wave, and throw a smoke grenade on the ground and we both disconnect.

So my question is: is it unethical to drop Wailing Woods and open the chests even if I’ve already done the weekly challenge?

Hi, i wanted to share some personal analysis to those who bought battle pass, and are asking theirself ""how far can i go with my playstyle?"". And to those who are aiming the top goal of this season's battle pass, aka The Reaper (John Wick) skin. I want it badly, as many of us. But **is reaching the battle pass 100 possible if you don't play 5h/day or/and play so badly that you never won a game ?**  
  
Answer is : **Yes** &amp; **No**. Let me explain...
  
.  
  
To reach the top of the battle pass, you have to combine some factors aka :  
  
* daily quest (70 dails for 5 stars = 350 possible stars so 35 levels)  
* weekly challenge and battle pass challenge (50 + 485 stars so 53.5 levels)  
* season level (158 + 50 + 100 stars so 31 levels)  
  
Total ? **119 levels**, and possibility to buy extra level with Vbucks. I don't know if people started with extra level from past season).  
  
.  
  
But there is some problems with this math. To get such levels, you have to reach 1 million xp for season level 100, play every day for two months, and success ALL challenges (daily+weekly). Well, are we all tryharder ? Not really. In fact, considering the xp i get for each game is between 100 for bad game (no kill, top 40) and 400-500 for good game (1-2 kill, top 10-20), i would say i get 300xp/game, which mean 3333 games to play to reach one million xp, which means around 50 games per day... Really ? Meeeeh.  
  
Ok, so i 'might' **not be able to reach season level 100** at all. I calculated, otherwise, my potential level i could reach as casual bad player :  
  
* I get 4000xp per challenge if i manage 4 objective, which is easy = 4000x9+4000 = 40k xp  
* I can play up to 3 games/daily, or around 10 games every 3 days (to max dailies) = 1000xp/day = 70k xp  
* the daily challenge give me a extra 500xp/day so 35k xp  
  
.  
  
Here is table with xp required each 10 season levels, that i made to calculate :  
  
* season lvl 10 = 6.300xp  
* season lvl 20 = 18.550xp  
* season lvl 30 = 35.800xp  
* season lvl 40 = 60.300xp  
* season lvl 50 = 99.300xp  
* season lvl 60 = 162.800xp  
* season lvl 70 = 260.800xp  
* season lvl 80 = 403.300xp  
* season lvl 90 = 628.300xp  
* season lvl 100 = 998.300xp  
  
Considering this table, i might end around level 55. I gonna try to push around 60. This will award me 60+30+94 = 184 stars. **I gonna miss 124 stars aka 13 levels over the 119.**  
  
.  
  
I can still reach the goal, but i must try not missing any daily or weekly. Sadly, **my guess is that some week 9-10 challenges will be too hard** (imagine the wailing woods, but on week 10 ? A bad player will never get it if he don't try hard the zone) and the ""win a game"" challenge 'might' never be validated for some bad players, even over 2 months. So if you say the 'won a game' challenge, a week10 10stars challenge, and another week10 5stars challenge, you miss again 25 stars, and you hit the LIMIT before being unable to get your goal without buying extra level with vbuck.  
  
In the end, the pattern still consider you never stop playing for 2 months, at least few games every 3 days to do yours daily, and **if you miss some daily/weekly challenges, you will have to push the season level a bit more far or pay vbuck**.  
  
.  
  
**In conclusion**, if you are a casual/bad player, and still want to reach battle pass 100, you will have to push a bit more far than your casual playstyle, otherwise you will fail. Good players will just have to play on regular basis. Wish good luck to all players to reach the top !",FortNiteBR

The shotguns are simply luck based, you hit someone with a tac or pump to the head at close range and the cross hair is dead center on their head and then it just damages them for 9 or 13 or whatever,
 and then my enemy hits me once to the head and they damage me for 150.

 It is so random and kills the skill.

And by the way it happens to both tac and pump.

I'm trying to say they need to fix it somehow.

Saw a guy launch pad onto this big man-made structure, look around, and then drop to the ground, so I figured he saw or heard something.  Launched one grenade to get them to fight each other.  The launch padder got killed and I then fired 4-5 grenades at the last guy while he was looting.

I seriously just have the “Play with a friend 0/10” and “revive fallen party member 0/5” challenges to do. The problem? I don’t have any friends... okay, no friends that play Fortnite that I know of so I have no one to bring into a party.

If someone can help me complete just these 2 missions, I would really appreciate it. Again, I’m not the best, so for some of you it may just be a pointless run, just letting you know in advanced.

Pros that i see by this is:

Making it more fair in fights.

Blue or toxic zone is more dangerous.

More competitive fights, no one have a much higher advantage, more focus to hit headshots.

I don't see any cons by it but im open for arguements.

A Golden Llama idol that spawns randomly in a chest anywhere on the map. It would be the only item in the chest and make some sort of noise or announcement when found. Since it's random it wouldn't always be found every game.

The idol would take up one inventory slot and drop on death like any other loot only it despawns/disappears if not picked up within 30 seconds or so.

If you or a member of your squad makes it out of the game with the idol in their inventory you would receive some small bonus or cosmetic. A golden glider or parasol perhaps? Or maybe a few bonus stars to the battlepass? The prize could vary from season to season.

I love all the weekly quest stuff that was added in season 3 so I was just toying with other side objectives that could add a bit more fun. More details to be fleshed out but that's the gist of it.

Thoughts?

---------------

1. There's basically no loot rng, so within the first minute everyone is gonna have the same loadout, and everyone also has the same loadout in lategame, which is basically just the starter loadout plus rpg or sniper.

No ""he got a legendary scar and a chug jug but I got a grey ar and a bush"".

---------------


2. Everyone is basically maxed on resources by lategame, so you can have real build battles without cheap shotgunning, and you can afford get creative with your buildings.


No ""he spammed ramps at me and one pumped me when I ran out of resources"".

---------------

3. No shotguns

People actually have to learn to aim and use a pistol and rifle. Also this makes dropping tilted in this mode fun.

---------------


4. Lots of launch pads


This speaks for itself

•100hp. No regeneration. But instead air drops of health aids come. (5)Bandages/(1)campfire
•weapons are Crossbow,tactical shotgun,pistol(all blue rarity)

Ammo can be adjusted but I was thinking maybe Crossbow(infinite as the usual), shotgun(40 shells), pistol(70 light bullets). Infected when killed will drop 5 shells and 10 light ammo.
Storm still closes to a random location to keep the game from campers and fast pace.
Unsure about the material. But I’ll say Max of only 50 wood material only. Infected and survivors can harvest so it

With AR's being very inconsistent and inaccurate, players almost always just rush you down through building and commence shotty duels. Considering they get the bonus of being a weapon that's going to be extremely strong due to the nature of third person shooters, they can just peek and in a split second do a massive amount of damage, something an AR or almost any other weapon can't punish. You can just build your own terrain to jump peek at will, so not only does the game naturally make players gravitate towards a weapon like a shotgun, but the damage and accuracy of shotguns makes them damn near essential at all stages of the game. Maybe the removal of the Tac shotgun could alleviate the current trend, because rushing someone with a pump is higher risk and allows more counterplay, but still has the potential to be effective.

It seems like they are the most used and the main weapon. You have people whos whole strategy is to build just to get in range to shotgun you. Seems pretty counterintuitive in a shooting game to be all about running in someones face and 1 shotting them with a shotgun and not even using a AR or a sniper at all.

Some suggestions i was thinking of is maybe changing how shotguns headshots work, unless someone is right in your face like 2 feet away all the pellets from a shotgun arent going to hit your head and ive been headshot (like 180 dmg) from one from like 20m away which just seems really weird to me. Or maybe making shotguns dmg just lower or maybe buffing smgs to being actually useful especially in close range to give people other options than a 180 dmg 1 shot. Im open to others ideas or opinions.",FortNiteBR

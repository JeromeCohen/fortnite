I’ve been sniping in fortnite for a while, so I wanted to help people learn how to snipe in fortnite. I’ve uploaded a meme sniping video on my YouTube channel, (which I’d post but when I do it’s “self-promo”) and I just put my best clips together, but anyway, fortnite sniping is very simple lol. If you look, you’ll see the markers on a sniping rifle (unless it’s a hunting rifle, which those are easier for sniping) each marker represents 50 meters. Every 50 meters, the sniper kinda drops a little, so you wanna kinda eyeball how far you’re going to shoot. I will most likely try to go into further detail with another post, but for now I’ll just to basic stuff about it. Hunting rifles don’t usually bullet drop until like 100-200+ meters I believe, so their way easier, but their also a lot faster. It just takes patience and understanding how snipers work. I’ll try to post a more detailed post, but I hope I’ve helped you guys! (Probably not)",FortNiteBR

I know none of us are happy about the nerf upon first glance, and especially first gameplay, but what EPIC is doing makes sense on a level beyond making the game easier for noobs. They are trying to make us value our resources more and use each different material to match the circumstance. 
The meta with building for so long has been ALLWOODEVERYTHING and we'd switch to metal and stone once our stack was gone, and then we'd easily farm it back up again. A lot of people don't even bother farming up anything besides wood and once they hit that 999 in that stack, they're set. This is going to change that. 
When the game first released I was making sure I had a decent amount if every material. I'd use wood to navigate terrain and that's basically it. Stone and metal were my go-to for making a fort(only 90s kids will remember). 
I think EPIC wants to bring it back to then, using wood(the most easuly farmed material) for travel  and as expendable material for combat. Using brick as a primary for combat and some slower engagements. Using metal for very slow combat and defensive fortifying like 1x1s.
By no means do I like the change, but I can understand the motivation behind it. There are 3 possible materials to farm up, and I'm sure they noticed that over 60%(made up statistic) of farmed material was wood. With anything when it comes to gaming and high pick rates, it has to be nerfed. 

Side note: I also absolutely believe that this is a first step to cutting down on material caps. Getting us to get used to farming all materials, and getting us less used to seeing 999 stacks. ",FortNiteBR

The SMG’s should undergo a heavy nerf or the shotguns should be re buffed to balance the game and when I say buffed I mean 200 damage headshots to get rid of SMG spam noobs to stop them ruining the fun for better players.

Twitch Name: Bshugan222

Hey y'all I am a beginner streamer on twitch and I am doing a 48 hour stream like the title says but, I wanted to explain a little about the stream and why it is happening! So a few days ago I found out that my wife is coming home from deployment early which is awesome because she's been gone for ages(actually like 9 months). The problem is the plane tickets are super high priced for something on such short notice. Before I figured out she was coming home I just spent a good chunk of money fixing an issue I was having with my car so I can't really afford the plane ticket to get there. I am also in the military so an extra grand + sitting around isn't exactly a luxury we have. But I figured if I could raise a little bit of awareness to the situation and maybe with a little penny pinching and some luck I might be able to make it there for the welcome home. Any questions or anything I may have not been clear on and people may want more info or whatever feel free to ask. Again all extra goes to charity, if you want to know more about the charity just let me know I can send you an email with a pamphlet or just tell you whatever you want to know! Thanks again guys and gals!

With max ammo, the P90 can output:
(999 ammo) * (24 damage per ammo) = 23,976 damage

Let’s say that the person on the receiving end has max mats: 999 wood, 999 brick, 999 metal
For every ten wood, ten brick, and ten metal he can spawn in an 80 hp barrier. Thus we have:
(990 wood) * (80 hp per 10 wood) + (990 brick) * (80 hp per 10 brick) + (990 metal) * (80 hp per 10 metal) = 23,760 hp

Thus we have the damage output on full ammo for the P90: 23,976 damage
vs.  the full hp possibly generated by full materials: 23,760 hp
Meaning that If someone has enough small ammo and a P90, you must build until you run out of mats to make them run out of bullets. Then they have the high ground, lots of mats, and every other gun in their arsenal to kill you.

I'm seemingly in the vocal minority, but I HATE building. I hate build battles, rushes and generally everything that has to do with building. I'm old and can't click to build shit anywhere near what the young'uns are doing. I usually sit and hide at the bottom and shoot out the base while they're building six stories above me still.

Base building in the last two seasons has gotten absurd. People are macro'ing, watching youtube tutorials, etc on how to build at superhuman speeds that outpace anyone who hasn't put serious time into that one aspect of the game.

This game is supposed to be Battle Royale with a building element -- not Build Royale with a shooting element. These changes (lowering health, more effective wall destroyers) help walk the game back in the direction that I fell in love with.

I just wanted to throw my two cents out in the hopes that for every negative, entitled post you're having to filter through you get a little love thrown your way too.",FortNiteBR

Over the course of Season 4 I accumulated about \~15 hours of playtime, things were tough and the learning curve was steep but I’d been a big PUBG player and enjoyed the genre and was hyped for the “FUN” aspects of the game (mobility, silly rocket rides, and bounce pads) 

But then PUBG got a big update and then the battle pass. I have just under 800 hours in PUBG and decided to give the game another shot.

Now that the short-lived return to PUBG has finished and still experiencing a-lot of the technical frustrations that come along with that game, I’m coming back to Fortnite. I have \~35 hours in Season 5 and just under the 50k XP mark with regular 900 v-buck battle pass (no additional levels purchased).

Now with my background out of the way

This game is getting to the point of being impenetrable, the skill cap is just too large and growing. When people come to this game I'd say it can be assumed most know how to do 3 things, move, loot and shoot. There is no chance to win against the majority of the player base using those 3 skills. 

You need to “feel” like you’re being competitive, even if you can’t “win” the ability to just have an inkling that you have a chance is important. It will keep you hooked and give you the drive to want to learn the building aspect.

I’ll use PUBG as an example. No matter your skill level, you always have a chance that you can kill a very skilled player. I get killed by any skill level frequently, because I missed a few shots or they caught me out of position, and when that happens they are rewarded for their good play or my misplay.

The TTK at longer range in Fortnite allows for a superior builder to win an engagement even if they misplay or are in a bad position, would say 95% of the time the only risk to a good builder is a better builder (the other 5% is a lucky snipe) You could be a great shooter, know the best spots for loot and have great positioning and movement, and none of those things matter against even an “ok” builder.

The only current competitive game that I can compare this skill discrepancy to is 1 v 1 Starcraft and even then to a lesser extent because it’s just 1 v 1 and skill based match making can do more for the scene to get you against someone who also sucks or is learning.

When you need 100 people to fill out the server it just exaggerates the issue further. As the skill gap increases the likelihood you will run into someone your own skill level goes down and down and down to the point where it will just be the people who were already good at the game fighting people who were already good at the game and the scene will stagnate. Like Starcraft.

I’m excited by having some more non-building options. I understand the vocal majority don’t want to see the meta change away from being build-centric and I don't think this does that, but if the game stays 2 minutes of building with 5 seconds of shooting, or if the only counter to building is MORE BUILDING, I’m probably out. I appreciate having play style options and having a “chance” against the top level players, that feeling of despair when you engage someone and then their 5-6 levels higher than you in 2 seconds just destroys the desire to jump back in to that next game because I was “*so close and if I’d just done that one thing I could have got him*” No, I had 0 chance, none, zilch, nada.

I understand being rewarded for improving your skills, and the good builders will always be at the top but guess what? I hope they try and keep the meta diverse , and I get a lucky p90 and eradicate your wall attempts and you shortly after with some good shooting because you weren’t paying attention while whacking a tree. Good for me, I deserve it for moving well out of your line of site, getting a good loot drop from a balloon I got to before everyone else and having the presence of mind and skill to shoot on target well even while you jump and put up walls. It took me 3 skills to counter your 1, and I think that’s fair.

TLDR: I am happy to have some options to fight a pro level builder, even if it’s just 10% more at my current skill level, it will give me more enjoyment of the game and will keep me playing while I working my building in the game.",FortNiteBR

Reddit mode is full of fun and exciting features that will let you showcase how skilled you are, here are the changes:

- Everyone starts with 200 of every material as soon as they exit the battle bus.

- Material harvesting buffed to playground mode levels. Never waste time collecting wood again!

- The material cap and max building height have been removed. Annoyed that build battles were just too short in S3? Well now the sky is no longer the limit as build battles can now go on perpetually. If the storm starts closing in on a mega build-off, a bubble of protection surrounds the players until a winner emerges.

- Materials strength is buffed by 500% and reaches max strength instantly. Never get shot down from a ramp again!

- SMGs have been vaulted. All of them.

- Explosives have also all been vaulted.

- LMGs, miniguns, and drum guns have also been vaulted. Actually, everything except shotguns, snipers, impulse grenades and healing has been vaulted because nothing else requires any skill.

- Pump shotguns can do 1 hit kills to players with 200 health again. Tired of only dealing 9 damage on headshots? We've fixed that by rewarding you with an instakill for hitting even 1 pellet to the head at any distance up to 50 meters.

- All limits on shotgun switching removed. You can now swap between shotguns instantly. 

- Only have a single pump shotgun? That's ok because the delay for cycling the next round has also been removed. Fire away as fast as you can hit the shoot button.

- Jetpacks have been re-introduced but picking one up kicks you out of the game.

-Attempting to shoot another player's ramp when he has the high ground will reflect and damage your own health. No defenses for losing the high ground, you should have been better at building.

- If you're getting unfairly teamed up on in solo squads (only noobs play with teammates) you can now hit a single button that will auto-rebuild a wall in front of you that will keep rebuilding and shielding you from damage until you run out of materials.



To be fair it takes a high IQ to be good at Fortnite like us, so Epic should listen to all of our complaints at once and give us skilled masters of gaming our own competitive game mode. What other great changes should Epic make to the game for us so we can all show how good we are?

Double pump was imbalanced at the start, they managed to balance them with the :

- Damage nerfs
- Delay nerfs

Shotguns became actually a lot slower and they were okay.

But, here we go to season 5 - double pumps are out. Why?

Well maybe because a lot of casual players were sick of getting double pumped or getting rushed, outbuilt etc. I just think a lot of guys didn't want to acknowledge pumps, or they didn't want to learn how to build and actually beat someone in that teamfights, where the shotguns were the primary weapons.

So - we come to this final part that is today.

New SMG came out - his fire rate is (needless to say IMBA) too much.
Besides that, we have the reformed SMG, and the Silenced One - they are all almost laser guns, with incredible fire rate and a huge clip (except silenced, it's fine imo)
I even forgot the Drum Gun, which makes it even harder to build with 50 clip gunning you down.

My conclusion :

Epic actually listened to the guys who didn't like the "" build fight "" and "" double pump "" meta. 
They removed that double pump meta, and now they nerfed the materials, the core mechanic to this game, even before they changed the floor mats to 20x instead of 30x.
They litteraly did everything to make players avoid build fights, and to make them crush the whole building thing you could make there.

I remember getting killed with pumps, but only if they outbuild me, then you can prove you are better.

I'm sick of being spammed to death c4ed to death, clingerd, and only dieing to bullshit ways. I never get out played it's always a bullshit death.


I know most of you dont give a shit and honestly I dont care I just need to vent and get my thoughts to some people, flame me and tell me to adapt all you want, the game is just boring not rewarding and this meta is not fun at all. Hope you casuals are happy for what you did to the game.

(Thoughts on Solo mode)","The moaning on here has just been phenomenal today, people that have yet to play a single match moaning about walls being shredded quicker than you can build &amp; explosives being OP. PVP Meta changes constantly in any game you play, this is the true sign of a skill gap... A player that can adapt his game and doesn't just rely on AR, Shotgun, Shotgun, Meds &amp; Explosive will go much further than the people that just hold on to what they perceive to be the best state of the game. In no particular order of importance, these are some of my current thoughts:

* If you're standing still and spamming a wall placement then obviously bullets are going to pass through and hit you, it's not hard to jump around and place a wall, heck it's not hard to jump around, place a wall &amp; ramp at the same time.

* Everyone moaning about how OP the P90 is, but everyone has access to it if its OP...try...using...it...for...yourself! The range on it honestly isn't great, with the wall HP nerf its a lot harder to just double ramp &amp; run up on someone, AR's are vital at range.

* C4 &amp; Spoldes do indeed do large damage to structures, but they still do the same damage to players. You can only carry 13 rockets now and tbh if you aren't able to counter 13 rockets with building and movement, then it's not this patch that's making you lose games.

These thoughts are only really related to Solo's, but I'm sure some could apply for other game modes too. Epic is constantly tweaking the game. The true sign of skill is the players that stay on-top through any 'Meta', the players that can adapt and think innovatively on their feet.

In my opinion, that sacrifice would be worth it to support and represent the minority of female players currently playing the game. It may even invite more female players to try Fortnite and purchase a Battle Pass if the purchasable and unlockable skins included a female version. 

It's a small step toward more inclusivity, something many other games seem to lack in terms of skins and playable characters.

One team of 25 (Defenders), one team of 75 (Attackers). Defenders drop on Spawn Island and fortify themselves. Attackers drop on the main island and push to invade Spawn Island. Defenders win by stopping the attacker’s invasion and attackers win by successfully conquering Spawn Island.

Defenders:
•2X all loot
•Increased spawn of thermal ARs, rocket launchers, traps, and metal
•25 llamas spawn and supply drops fall every 3 minutes 
•Cannot build off of Spawn Island

Attackers:
•3X material and material limit increased to 1500
•Every chest and ammo box spawn
•Increased spawn of Scoped ARs, snipers, grenade launchers, launch pads, and wood
•50 llamas spawn and supply drops fall every 2.5 minutes
•Structures built before the halfway point to Spawn Island cannot be destroyed by the Defenders

Storm:
Storm closes on Spawn Island. First circle always starts at 75% of the distance from Spawn Island to Main Island; lasts 12 minutes. Second circle spawns on Spawn Island; lasts 5 minutes. Third circle lasts 2.5 minutes and closes completely.

I can't think of a single individual who plays this game on a consistent basis that has asked for the core gameplay mechanic to be watered down. You have one of the most unique games on the market right now, and you're ruining it. I'm all for balance changes, I'm all for making things more ""noob"" friendly, but not at the cost of fun. Not at the cost of throwing away your core players. 

Balance changes should be just that. Balanced. Why are guns being made almost obsolete? Why is the pump shotgun even in the game anymore when both of the other shotguns are leagues better? Why are SMGs doing what assault rifles should be doing, arguably better than the assault rifles? Why are explosives the sole answer in every match I play to me outbuilding someone? Counterplay is important, but making things obsolete instead of disadvantageous at the hand of their counter is unacceptable. Carrying 30 C4, a P90 and some minis might be better than having a ""well rounded"" loadout at this point.

Despite what I've said, my biggest problem doesn't lie in weapons being obsolete, or explosives being ridiculous. It lies in the constant building nerfs. You've put $100,000,000 into competitive Fortnite, and at this rate, all of that money is going to waste. You've put money into something that people care about, but then you've neutered it in the process.

Maybe I'm wrong about everything and all of this is for the best. But please, consider listening to the community on this one. Restore building back to its former glory. If pumps stay obsolete and this SMG spraying meta is what you want, so be it. But building should never have been touched.

Sincerely, a casual player.",FortNiteBR

This game literally takes two steps back after every patch, it's honestly getting ridiculous.

The new P90 is honestly disgusting, frankly every SMG right now is disgusting. You don't even need to carry an AR or shotgun anymore. At least with the double pump meta you had to aim and think to get an advantage. The skill gap from double pump meta and this meta has decreased dramatically. 

Half my kills in this game is currently shooting someone with an SMG and them just getting melted. They build, spray through it. Half the time when you're fighting someone even remotely competent you burn through materials extremely fast. After a decent fight with a player I consistently burn through 500 materials or more every time. And with the current structure health nerfs in this current patch that number will only increase. That's only made worse with the current material gain nerfs in place.

If Epic really wants to go down this route of nerfing building structures why not just increase material gain for compensation?

I really don't understand the mindset of Epic nerfing the only skill gap in the game currently. It's like slapping the dedicated players that want to see this game succeed in the face. I'd consider myself someone who is in the hardcore demographic and currently it seems Epic is only listening to the casuals. Casual players will not keep this game alive; they will move on to the next game when something new and popular comes out. You need to keep the hardcore players invested or this game will not stay relevant.

Look at CS:GO, LoL, Dota 2, Quake, etc. Yes Fortnite is the most popular game out right now and yes their everyday players well exceed over some of the games currently listed, but that's normal. Fortnite is new and popular. But the listed games aren't dead, their hardcore demographic (pros) have stayed loyal and are keeping their game relevant. 

Sooner or later the trendiness of Fortnite will die off and if Fortnite keeps continuing down this road of making this game more for the casuals, the game will suffer. If Epic has any interest of keeping this game relevant then things have to change. It could also be Epic doesn't care and they're trying to make the most amount of money possible, if that's the route they choose then more power to them.",FortNiteBR

Also “spraying and praying” takes way more gun skill than people give credit. In my opinion, the game has never been more balanced.


I’ve been playing since season 1 and I had a blast in the old meta. The double pumping and build fight days were great. Double pumping got a lot of hate among the community (mainly the players who refused to take the time to learn it lol)—but it was a hard skill to master, and once I got the hang of it I noticed huge improvements in my game. This aspect of the game was very rewarding, and so was the closing the skill gap in terms of building. Once the top players showed how building could really be used the community took off and build fights became the new norm. You would be excited to see good players because it meant you would build to the heavens in a drawn out fight and when you finally killed him 20 stories up it would be a very rewarding feeling.

However, all good things must come to an end. This game being as popular as it is (and even more popular a few months ago) meant that a ton of people played the absolute shit out of it and the amount of “good builders” skyrocketed. These build fights that once were once in a game fights were now being fought one out of every five fights. This put a huge strain on materials, as the player with more materials would often win. The only counter to a player building above you was to build even higher. Fights were lasting longer and longer, and clearing a popular drop zone was taking so long that I was getting caught in the storm at places like Retail and Pleasant, due to how long these mini build fights were taking. 

Towards the end, build fights had become completely stale. Any time someone would start double ramping to me I would let out an audible sigh and proceed to get the high ground because I knew that wasting any time to shoot their structure would get me killed. After a few stories of build fighting with no end in sight I would just drop down because of how much people had started to shoot down large build fight structures, knowing they could get easy kills. The amount of time I spent searching for someone in the 5x5 20 story maze we just constructed still gives me nightmares. I consider myself a solid player and I have won more than my fair share of 1v2/1v3/1v4. People talk a lot about skill gap and how its much harder to play solo vs teams in the current meta. Yes, it was much easier to beat a team of bad players. But during the height of the build meta, winning against two competetive players was actually impossible. There was no counter. If they were good enough not to let themselves be exposed, one shoots while the other gets high ground. Rinse repeat until you are dead. Bottom line is that all the building became very frustrating, teams were getting separated, double ramps were everywhere and if someone got the high ground on you while you were fighting another player/team it was as good as over because it was so much harder to get them down.

Fast forward to today, and the game is much, much different. Building is a privilege not a right, and a weak ramp push is very punishable. Guns are much more equipped to damage and break structures. Build fights of old are nonexistent, because players have realized it’s better to both shoot and build rather than just have your blueprint out. Players say “building is the skill gap” but that really is not true anymore. Good building is a dime a dozen. To me the skill gap is being able to aim well, build well, and know when to do which. I think a lot of people never realized how forgiving shotguns were in terms of gun skill. With the power shifting to close range automatic weapons, people are realizing how hard it is to keep their reticle on a target while moving and jumping rather than just shifting it there for one frame and clicking. When they die they blame spray and pray, shit gun mechanics (bloom), and build nerfs when in reality they just can’t aim as well as they thought they could. You can’t just rush and jump into a team of four players anymore, no matter how skilled, because odds are enough of the SMG bullets are going to hit you. This is the way it should be. Adapt your playstyle. But you do have a chance again against competitive players because they can’t just build circles around you anymore. The sweet spot as far as high ground is now three stories up, because building is more fragile. Good players know this and lose high ground, get it back, rinse repeat. This is much more balanced than a good player in the final circle being invincible seven stories up with ramp, wall, floor.

This is just a screenshot into how balanced I think the game is right now. It has never been more balanced in my opinion. No, every gun does not have to be good for a game to be balanced, and no, shotguns being bad doesn’t make a game less balanced. Because they really are bad, just like one month ago the SMG was bad. Every gun has its time as the game ebbs and flows, just like every other game that has active development. It’s also nice to see other resources than wood getting some love.

The main complaints I had with the game were explosives—rocket launcher is very balanced but C4 and grenade launcher were too powerful after the damage to structures buff. They just didn’t give you enough time to react and if a good player got into the sweet spot you would be dead with no counter. They reverted this damage to structures in the recent patch, so I can’t pinpoint anything in the game that needs fixing. Change my mind.",FortNiteBR

Many of you say that epic is catering to noobs. How come? Skilled players will still be dominating, and noobs be noobs. Skilled players adapt to the new changes, and it is refreshing to adjust and face a new challenge.

Actually before this meta you could be a good builder and you would be among the best, now even pros will have to be more creative and find new solutions. I think also the skill cap is higher now than before, we will see a big difference between good players and very good players.

I believe all this non sense and whining of you butthurt teenagers is because you all are still noobs that relied too much on comfort. 

Fornite is still be changing with both failure and success and I believe Epic have proven that they will do their best to ensure that their game will be improving and as exciting as possible.

I don’t have to be the one that makes front page but someone does. 

1.  Epic we NEED a meta where double pump, pump tac, single pump, pump lmg, and pump tac smg are all viable. 

      Last season I feel shotguns were the closest to perfection, with the heavy shotgun being the exception. Double pump was strong but could be countered by someone with pump tac because you had to land your first two shots with double pump for solid dmg to kill and if you missed the second shot someone with pump tac could get 2 tac shots off at you before you could swap to your next pump and shoot after missing. Same with tac smg if you preferred that you could use it and melt people really quickly at close range, spray their walls IN A WAY THAT WASN’T OP, and punish people for missing shots. Same goes for pump lmg.
  
     To balance shotguns the shotguns you should SLIGHTLY buff tacs, take out pump swap delay and let double pump take three shots to kill, leave heavy shotguns how they are but SLIGHTLY nerf range. The reason I say take out pump delay is so the game gives you as much control over your guns and not have you wait for something out your control, I say pump should be three shots to kill because this will result in someone most likely killing you because they had good and CONSISTENT aim and you won’t die to very lucky shots and also helps balance double pump so someone can reaction build before they are dead. Also if double pump is three shots to kill it will MOST LIKELY lose to someone with a two shot double heavy as it should since the rarities come into play. Buff tacs because they need some love when is comes their dmg since the nerfs and nerf heavy range because they do over 100 dmg at some ridiculous ranges.

2.   Epic these new smg’s are RIDICULOUS and OBNOXIOUS beyond comprehension. 

       I honestly don’t know where to start about the smg, drum gun, and the p90. They need to do SIGNIFICANTLY less dmg to structures except drum gun, just slightly for it. The smg and p90 both need dmg nerfs and the hipfire spreads still and moving need BIG BOY NERFS. 
I don’t think drum gun should be changed too much that people that want “options” can still use it as an AR.

3.   The ‘splodes nerf was annoying but not game breaking, one of the few major changes that you just had to get used to and kind of left a sour taste your mouth. 

        I feel that the rocket cap being set at 12  is fine because you shouldn’t need more than 12 rpg rockets to kill someone or a team if your teammates are helping as you shoot rockets and same goes for the G launcher, 18 is more than enough. BUT the problem I have with ‘splodes is that they are not easy enough to find at all, I will 6 rockets tops until I kill that one dude that has all the loot right before end game. 

4. Last, but sure as heck not least is building.

      Mat gain is ATROCIOUS. I will start with early game, I  spend early game looting and usually I break the one-hit wood(beds, chairs, tables,etc) in homes Incase I need to get into a brief build battle, I used to be able to leave my landing house with around 200 wood to get into a battle or two because I drop semi-populated areas and  I run into people or just want kills. Now I am finding myself struggle to leave with 150 mats and usually around 100 is where I sit. This may not sound like much but this mats difference can cost you the early game. Now let’s say I survive early game, I won’t have many mats since I collected some then fought collected then fought again, so now I go to let’s say that forest behind Retail Row. I must spend almost my entire mid game to have a good mat count that I am not really comfortable with.  Now It’s mid game and someone starts AR or smg spamming me and this is what happens. A)I push with very few mats and most likely die or win and spend ages farming again and start getting shot at again because someone most like lay heard the fight. B) I try my best to disengage and die by losing all my mats or successfully disengage but only have half my mats left from the spam and then farm back up for ages and have someone shoot at me again because they heard the fight. BOTTOM LINE FOR MAT GAIN is that spend ages getting mats, lose all those mats by getting spammed to death or win and refarm all those mats that you just tediously farmed.

    Return the mat health to season 4’s, 
Meaning buff wood and brick and metal is fine.


Plz comment and RESPECTFULLY tell me if you feel like something should change, If you agree, left out something important. We need to change this disgusting meta or I will simply never pick up this once beautiful F2P title again.

Now, everyone is just running around with these overpowered smgs that take no skill whatsoever. These guns rip through walls and buildings so fast, that you don’t even have time to shoot back if they’re spamming. These shots also go through walls, because it’s physically impossible to build fast enough to block all of the shots. This new smg meta just kills the skill gap immensely. It counters building, and if you get shot from behind, you get shredded so fast, you will have barely anytime to react. The double pump or “double shotty” meta didn’t affect building or other skill-based mechanics. You actually needed to be able to build to use it as well. It was also pretty easily countered if you got the high ground over them. Now, everyone is in the mindset of just spraying and praying, with this new overpowered gun.

Back than I was full of hope that once I will be better and will improve after 2 or 3 weeks of playing.

Now... I can build a staircase before get oneshot right to the face.

""Where is the problem with that?"" you might think

The problem is that in 3 weeks I have won 3 solos by camping bushes and shooting last player from his base when he stopped paying attention to those bushes. 1 duo victory royal (thanks to my friend for carry) and 1 squad victory royal (thanks to that same friend - I died 1 minute into that game).

I recently I got into my first actual build-fight with a player of the same skill level. I won that build-fight and got sniped right afterwards. I finally I understood how much fun it is to build-fight. But for that matter I also understood that it can only be fun if player that fight are of the same skill group.

Therefore I was thinking *""Do I even have fun playing this game even when it is so frustrating? ""*

The answer is... Sometimes. It is absolutely not fun when I meet those John Wick players that snipe me across the whole map while they are jumping and building mansions in matter of seconds. That is 0/1000 fun for me. When I meet player that is way worse that I am (SypherPK calls them BOTs) it is about 35/100 cause they give no challenge but it fun to watch them (I truly believe that on the other side there is a dog) and when I meet a player who's been playing for the same 3 weeks as myself... 100/100 it is challenging it is fun and it is balanced fight.

Even my favorite streamer said that he wouldn't want to be starting to play Fortnite at this point of the time because it has to be extremely frustrating for new players. *""Back when I was new, everyone was new. Nobody new the mechanics of the game and people were learning together.""*

# ----- My solution ---------------------------------

**Skill groups  :   ×**

\-------------------------------

| How wold you measure skill in fortnite? By wins? KD? Nah that wouldn't work and would make the game extremely toxic

**ELO :   ×**

\-------------------------------

| Same problem as *skill groups*

Now you might think that there is no solution possible but there is.

**Make a newbie queue that of course would be voluntary to join. It would be only for playing with under some post-first-game time window.**

***Imagine a player:***

First game - *June 30th 2018*

Played matches - *1256*

Wins: *6*

KD : *0.42*

This is kind of player that needs this because otherwise they won't get any better

But let's say ***this player:***

First game - *June 3rd 2018*

Played matches - *650*

Wins: *125*

KD: *6.3*

I guess this one it pretty good so why would he be joining this queue

***My own stats:***

First game - *July 1st 2018*

Played matches - *795*

Wins: *5*

KD: *0.6*

I think I need something like this.

# How to ensure this?

Look at their winrate in normal queues and KD to see how they were doing. Make every player play let's say 25 matches in normal queue before allowing him to join beginner queue to see if he get's let's say: ***either 2 wins (might get one if lucky) or KD &gt; 1.5 in those matches. If not he is eligible to join beginners queue if they do better they are just smurfs trying to get into this queue.***

# For how long would player be eligible to stay in beginners queue?

**Case of ineligibility #1:** *1000 matches in beginners queue*

**Case of ineligibility #2:** *25 victories royal in the beginners queue*

**Case of ineligibility #3:** *Have been ACTIVELY playing fortnite for more than 6 weeks*

**Case of ineligibility #4:**  Average KD in beginners queue exceeds 5 in last *50 matches*. *(Guess this one would be extremely rare)*

# What would players get from this queue?

New players like myself are getting frustrated because they only way we can practice is either stay hidden in wailing woods and practice our building while other players just slain one another or to go into playground mode with some of our friends (who are most likely not going to want to help because they want to play against good players).This beginner queue would give players option to play against actual players that are not going to destroy them in 1 second after they fight starts.

* **More good experience for beginner players**
* **New players would be getting frustrating and stop playing fortnite after 50 matches**

Fortnite is following a trend that I've witnessed destroy games and communities, and frankly I'm worried for its longevity. When a game gets as big as Fortnite is right now, patching the game and keeping the entire player base satisfied is impossible. But Epic hasn’t been patching the game in attempts to make everyone happy, they’ve been patching the game to make new players happy. The skill gap that many of us play hours a day in attempt to widen, is getting smaller and smaller. Each patch Epic implements small changes that cap a players ability to grow or even reduce the effectiveness of a given player’s current skill set. If Epic continues to diminish the skill gap in attempts to make the new player competitive I guarantee this will eventually lead to Fortnite’s demise. One statistic that is really important to game developers and any game attempting to turn a profit is new customer acquisition and retention rates. Essentially when a person first picks up Fortnite, do they stick with it? Much of this depends on the slope of the learning curve in the game. When developers make the slope of a game’s learning curve more gradual they see an increase in new player retention rates. New players being able to compete and even win the game makes them far more likely to enjoy it and continue playing. But gradually making the learning curve less steep often times this has the inverse effect for top tier players. What game developers need to understand is making new players able to compete with someone with 1000+ hours is not healthy for a game. Players enjoy the feeling of improvement, attempting to level the playing field between skilled players and non skilled players is counterintuitive and incredible destructive for a games ecosystem.

Lets highlight a couple changes for the sake of this thread:
-Material nerfs from chests and environment around the map
-Introduction of the new SMGs
-Introduction of C4
-Cap on Rockets
-New damage to structures change
-Removal of Double Shotgun Meta

Each of these changes whether you realize it or not is diminishing the skill gap between new players and veterans. Epic has come out publicly and endorsed “different play styles”. But the only play style we’ve seen them endorse is the non-builder. As anyone who plays Fortnite knows building is the mechanic that distinguishes the player base. A player who does not build has little to no chance against a seasoned builder. And this is the way that it should be. Epic wants the seasoned builder and the non-builder to have a marginally smaller predictable chance of outcome. With the slight nerf to material collection through chests and the environment it has made it harder and harder for players to acquire a stockpile of materials without devoting a large portion of the game to farming. Alongside that fact is the introduction of the new SMGs, C4, and change to structure damage. That 999 wood you just took five minutes to farm is going to vanish if you run into any player with a P90, SMG, or a stack of C4. Building is being nerfed consistently every patch yet Epic endorses all different play styles? It seems like they don’t really endorse anything but making building a less effective tool for outplay. What they need to realize is building is not a “play style”, building is a core game mechanic and tampering with it too much could be dangerous. 

We are now seeing absurd time-to-kill (TTK). While I believe this doesn’t help anyone in the game, noob or veteran, I believe this is also destructive for a battle royale. Have you died recently in game to an SMG or Scar and thought to yourself “I didn’t even have time to react?” With SMGs shooting twenty bullets a second, with base damage of 20 and headshot damage of 40+ you can die in half a second or less. Fortnite’s TTK is reaching Call of Duty levels, and for a Battle Royale where respawning is not an option this is no bueno. It leaves players feeling cheated not outplayed.

While I wholeheartedly agree with the cap placed on rocket ammo this again is a nerf to the veteran player. Often times I found myself at the end of a game with 8 kills 40+ rockets and a grenade launcher. While rocket spam was incredibly abusive it promoted aggressive play. Players camping, only coming into conflict once or twice before the end of a game, dropping on the outskirts of loot lake had little to no chance of amounting a 40+ stockpile of rockets. You had to kill atleast a couple people to achieve such ammo numbers. While I agree with this change, it is important to highlight again the effects of the change on player base.

There is no variation in close weapon meta. Players are now strictly using a shotgun, paired with an SMG. A shotgun without an SMG is obsolete (pump and heavy) and an SMG without a shotgun is viable. We are now in a state where no shotgun has the ability to one shot someone from any range with 200 health. This means that if you are to hit a shotgun shot, it needs to be followed up by subsequent damage to knock the player. In my personal experience I find players are beginning to rely solely on SMG’s in close quarter combat. The disadvantage of missing a shotgun shot, or not getting a critical hit is too large at this point in time. Giving up that half second or more that it takes to fire your shotgun and then switch to an SMG is getting you killed. Dealing 100 damage with a shotgun is no longer significant when .25 seconds of P90 fire can kill you. Without the ability to down a player with a single shotgun shot, your risking dying to the individual who hip fires a blue FN P90.

Fortnite please listen. I’ve seen games cater to the new player and destroy themselves. Look at world of warcraft. They dumbed down the game to a point where long time subscribers no longer enjoyed the simplicity of the game and felt as if all the time they invested into learning and becoming better was obsolete. I don’t want to see this happen again. Add items to the game that take skill to use, give the noobs a chance, but not an even chance to players that have been here since October. ",FortNiteBR

As far as the new meta being spray and pray we also need to adapt new ways of defending ourselves or escaping situations that are dangerous. The game is becoming newbie friendly but the people who can adapt and overcome will always be on top. 

Finally epic is speeding up fights meaning your not in a fight for 3-4 minutes attracting everybody else on the map to finish you while you heal. Sped up fights equals more action and faster games. 

TLDR; thank you epic for continuing to evolve gameplay forcing us to adapt to new playstyles instead of rinse and repeat battles",FortNiteBR

Yeah they add stuff and have rifts and whatnot, but if this game becomes just a shooter, why would I not go play something more refined like CoD or battlefield when it comes out?

My opinion will most likely change about the patch but I still wanted to post this. It came out way longer than I anticipated so a TL:DR is included at the bottom.


Up to season 4 most players had a 3 or four weapon setup:

* AR

* Shotgun

* Secondary weapon for shotgun (usually another shotgun or an smg)

* snipers/splodes

Then everyone sort of realised how good the tac smg is and some people started to use it as an AR and secondary at the same time.

And then 5.0 happened and with it came the death of double shotguns and a new smg to replace the vaulted tac smg. This new smg is a great weapon for close to mid-range, and because of this some players used it as a shotgun substitute, meaning they only had 3 weapons.

And now came the P90. An smg viable to close, mid and even decently long range. In theory if you can play with just a legendary P90 and a sniper/splode, whatever you prefer. This weapon happens to also have the highest dps in the whole game. As of me writing this I've found no stats other than the per-bullet damage which in case of the legendary version is 24, and it's fire rate is at least as high as the current SMGs.

This weapon makes the shotguns and ARs irrelevant. The worst part is that with the building nerfs there is no counter to it like there was for the double pump. My point is that this weapon does not need to exist in this state since the blue submachine gun is plenty powerful already.

 I get that Epic is a company and they are driven to get money, but with the recent changes instead of keeping your current fanbase of people who are willing to pay you are driving them away and inviting a new more ""casual"" playerbase who may not be willing to invest 20 bucks into the game regularly.

###How could they solve this?

Just nerf the P90's damage and rebuff building. We are at a point where the core building aspect of the game is getting less and less relevant. Which sucks since that is what made the game different.

**Sidenote**: both fast farming and crouch peaking seem to still be possible so yeah that's nice

####TL:DR: The P90 is a weapon viable for almost all situations making it waay too powerful and there is no hardcounter for it since it shreds through everything you could build in front of it? In my opinion the game is headed in a completely bloom based meta and from reading this sub it doesn't seem to be something the playerbase wants.",FortNiteBR

But more-so im hearing a lot of people complaining about SMGs being too powerful. 

I've always advocated against reducing shotgun damage. Nothing is worst than watching someone rush you with ramps, only so he can get as close as possible to one shot you. Y'all gotta understand, the SMG and Shotgun are literally the exact same thing. 

now let me get to the main point here. I think the reason BR are so big is because you can ACTUALLY use tactics, unlike COD. So the fact that there ARE even metas in the game means that it needs to be changed. I always think of this game as the Hungar Games, anything goes and anyone can win...even the smallest person. 

You guys got good with the shitgun, you'll learn how to get good with the SMG, and you'll learn how to get good with the next big gun update. Just because you're getting shit on with a new play style doesnt make you trash. Just because you were great with last season meta doesn't make you a god. Don't threaten yourself to quit because you don't want to learn a new way to play. This is literally the best game ever

We gotta chill a bit. I know we see a building ""nerf"" and suddenly ""EPIC HATES US THEY'RE RUINING THE GAME, DAMN CASUALS!!!"" This happens every single time there is a new update. But to everybody screaming about how the game is ruined now, I have a question. Have you played it yet? Have you even played since the update? Or are you at work or school thinking about how bad the game must be now and jumping very quickly to conclusions? Take a breath and see how it plays out. Give the update a chance before you scream about how bad it is online. And I don't mean one game or two, where someone killed you once with an SMG, or burned your build while you were shielding. No I mean take a week. Play the game. Make adjustments to the new meta. Gather your own evidence and then decide how YOU actually feel about the way the game plays. Then come online and share your opinions in a well thought out manner with a week's worth of experience to speak from. People always freak out about change immediately. These new changes may be good, they may be bad, but let's actually play the game before we jump to either conclusion.

Additional note.... No matter how much they ""nerf"" building, the better player will still win 9 times out of 10. I know that's hard to believe, but just because walls and ramps come down faster does not mean that the game is easy now. If you're really good at the game you will kill that potato, regardless of if it's easier to take down your ramp or not. Good players will still be able to play aggressively. It may be more challenging, but they will adjust because that's what makes them good players.  Being good at the game is SO much more than being able to build quickly. Each engagement is a mini chess game. Each fight is a mix of being technically sound, out-maneuvering, out-thinking, and hitting your shots kid. There is a lot more to a fight than just ramping and shooting.

Been here since the beginning, I've always sucked at shooters, I'm too old, too slow and not experienced enough in gaming since a very young age.

EPIC; ""Hold that thought my man"" enter smg and 'splode spam.

I never double pumped (not good enough) and agree pumps were OP as hell for a while, i agree in the shotgun nerf. But i still use them as i need to take my time to shoot, how can i ever now get off 4 pumps to a head of 200hp when i'm fisted by c4 and smg spam?

It's a real shame, but the game that got me back into games has disintegrated.

I will voice my opinion and give some suggestions, which I think would improve the game. I am happy to discuss those with you.  


To start things off I think this patch made a lot of mistakes, but there are some good changes. Mainly the Slurp and Supply Drop changes. I like those, I think they are healthy changes overall, no complaints here. I also won't say anything about the Circle changes because I didn't get a proper feel for those yet.  


**New SMG P90**  
This weapon is beyond broken. The grey, green and blue SMGs are already very strong and counter building quite well, but this is on a whole new level. If someone boxes himself in you can just shred their building and kill them with this weapon.  
My suggestion (not considering vaulting the weapon): Nerf the DMG of all the SMGs and make the upgrade from blue to purple just the ammo capacity and then increase DMG for the legendary version.  
For example:

* Grey: 18 DMG
* Green: 19 DMG
* Blue: 20 DMG
* Purple: 20 DMG but 50 round capacity
* Gold: 21 DMG 50 round capacity

The numbers are just examples, but I do think there should be a DMG nerf for all SMGs.

**Building Changes**

I don't like this change and wouldn't mind seeing it reverted, but there is 1 upside I can think off, it makes the shotgun DMG to buildings nerf less relevant. I do think this building nerf would be less of a concern with weaker SMGs.  
They also increased Pickaxe DMG to player built structures. I feel like this is fine, but at least increase overall Pickaxe DMG so farming gets faster.  


**Birch tree nerf**  
This was not in the patch notes. I noticed our friend the Birch got nerfed. HP went up from 150 to 300 but it still gives the same amount of mats. RIP Birch.

**Explosive Changes**

Apparently they nerfed splodes (or at least C4) so it doesn't deal DMG through structures anymore. Thank God, good change.  


**Improved handling of collision**  
Its too early to tell how good it works or doesn't work. If it means less enemies phasing through our structures it is a very good and long awaited change.  


**Pump Shotgund equip delay**  
This has nothing to do with this patch except for the fact, that this change is missing. It has been suggested many times and I will do so again. Remove the Pump equip delay. It was meant as a counter to double Pump which got resolved in another way and has no justification to stay in the game.

To end this post I would like to say, this Patch did a lot of things right and I know you (Epic) don't want to ruin this game like you often get accused of. But the bad changes are REALLY bad in my opinion. I hope you see this needs fixing and have faith that if you do, you will find a solution.

[5.1 Patch Response]","I've spent hundreds of hours trying to improve as much as possible at this game. I loved every second of that journey, by mid S4 I had reached a KD and W% I am very satisfied with. I finally feel ""decent"" at the game, I was able to handle multiple enemies at once, I rarely lost high ground, my aim got very good, etc. 

Now with the current meta, I feel like all of those hundreds of hours have been wasted. I rarely, if ever, feel genuinely outplayed anymore. If I'm in duos/squads especially, I just get spammed into oblivion from explosions and fast firing weapons such as the SMGs/Drum Gun. No amount of skill I've curated these past few months getting my building to a good level has been able to save me in more situations than I can count. I am now losing encounters to players with literally a third of my KD/W%, even in solos, just because they found a grenade launcher or something similar spam-wise. 

Is this what Epic wants? To see which players can hold down the fire button indefinitely until they somehow luckily get a kill? Now, I'm not trying to discourage new/casual players, but you should be rewarded for investing time into this game, in the sense that your skill fucking matters. 

After this latest patch with huge nerfs to building/mats once again, I am considering putting down this game. It's sad, it was one of my favorite and most played games of ALL TIME. But now, I just feel I am wasting my time. Where as I used to come away from my play sessions feeling really satisfied and incredibly motivated to play again ASAP, I now close the game in frustration and play less and less.

I understand that  epic does this because they want to give the casual player a more fair experience. Another problem with this update is the new smg the P90. It has way to much ammo and shoot Waaaay too fast and can destory structures and players way to fast and is pretty much the smg but better ammo wise and damage wise. The non casual player the people that play a lot usually rely on the building in this game which makes them better than the people that doesnt build (the casual) and with this update its pretty much lowering the skill gap allowing the casual to win more gunfights against the non casual player and i think that this is a problem. First of all this is a battle royale  and the strongest person in the game is supposed to win not the weakest one. Second of all a point that i dont think epic understands. By nerfing the good players this may result in some of them leaving especially now with new games coming out such as fallout, skyrim, BO4 etc. And the casual player usually follows trends so when no one is playing this game that will result in less free fortnite ads on twitch and youtube (the ads im refering to is just normal fortnite videos) and that will lead to more and more casual players moving away from fortnite to other games.

 Don't get me wrong,  e-sports are not supposed to be only skill-based, they're supposed to be fun to watch, but when someone can get lucky and kill a player better than them because the game encourages it, there's a problem.

 Notice how on all of the new guns there is no first shot accuracy, to promote usage of bloom and casual play of course.

 This game was almost perfect in Season 2 : It was appealing to the casual audience, it was fun and still appealing to the e-sports audience because building wasn't so easily countered by absolutely everything in the game and double shotgun was still viable.

If you try to build with TurboBuilding against it you still get hit so often. People can die within miliseconds if you sneak up or they peek too long... I was always thinking like EPIC has done everything right in the past. All updates were great and useful until it started with the C4 and SMG buff together with explosives destroying all structures around.

Rest does the game for you. 

I enjoyed this game so much and grinded it since I loved it. Got Level 98 in S4 and currently am at 65 in S5 but I just don´t like being unable to defend myself or not be able to kill someone in the start because they find an SMG while I get Pistols.

Since season 4, we've seen a decrease in building battles. The building is what makes this game stand out, and interesting. If I wanted to play a standard FPS game, I wouldn't play Fortnite.

They still have not buffed shotgun, after removing double pump. With this new SMG, the shotgun won't be viable. Even on close range, players will shredd you within seconds. ARs are barely being used.

Before the season 5 patch, after the SMG buff, was a good time. Most of the guns were viable, and you had many options with what you wanted to play.(Double shotgun, SMGs, ARs etc)

Compared to now, which is just SMG.

What changes I would like to see:

\- Buff ARs accuracy.

\- Revert explosive damage, or significantly decrease the radius. You can literally destroy a building in tilted tower with a stack of C4.

\- Cap C4 and grenades. (Stack of 5 just like stink bomb)

\- Buff shotguns, they should obviously be able to one shot in the head. (If legendary)

Yet again, I feel like I have to. This update not only encourages any player to use SMGs even more with the new highly destructive Compact P90, but even worse, it lowers the starting HP of a wall to 80 from 100. 

I'm not saying this because I feel like I need to complain about something, but rather because it literally hurts my soul seeing the new meta SCREAMING ""spam SMG"" even more. It was too much since the buff of them, now the building gets nerfed? I had problems in 5.0 with people in duos/squads spamming my building before I could react, and even if I was a much better builder than them still had no chance to win against two angry left click warriors. 

This is so much of a change, and even if some players won't recognize it at first, slowly you'll see this sorta become more like a spam duel, if it keeps going like that. I love Epic and changes they've made in general but they REALLY, REALLY have to think about the building emphatics as well. I've started playing in the lasy half of season 3, and gathered up 500 wins. All of them which I tried to win using BUILDING + shooting combined, not spamming like a kid every player cause that's just what everyone does, what the game wants amd basically I've got no other choices. Too bad seeing this happen, since day 1 I've been trying to get better every lose and see what I did wrong, try to fix that mistake and move on, but if I'll die from SMG spamming mostly every game when I get pinched (let's be honest, it happens sometimes even though your position isn't really aggressive, unless you're camping in an 1by1) I won't know what could I change about my gameplay, except spamming like a madman as well.

I truly hope Epic will revert this change as it has been unnecessarily added and WILL hurt the loyal part of community that loves the building aspect and isn't here for the rng.

TL;DR: walls just got nerfed, now starting at 80 HP, compared to 100 HP. This along the newly added compact SMG will popularize spamming even more, and unfortunaty heavily damage the good builders. Especially if left alone and getting spammed in duos/squads, it will make the game even more frustrating having no chance to defend yourself.",FortNiteBR

The Rocket- and Grenadelauncher spam was bad too.

But the P90 is the cherry ontop of this now luck based game.

If you don't know what I mean by that, here's a simple explanation:

The P90 and SMG are so Overpowerd that no other weapon can compete against them except for maybe Snipe- oh wait, no, you can still get hit by the P90 and SMG over 250m. So if you don't find the P90 or the SMG you're basically done for. Both the P90 and SMG have no recoil, an insane rate of fire, so much ammo and deal so much damage in such a short amount of time that the game has become a point and click game for everyone who has it.

I'm literally uninstalling the game as we talk because it's becomming a noob and luck fest. You either get the new weapons, play them and in the top 10 you play against 9 other people were everyone has a minigun with 50 bullets and no recoil - or you don't and die in the top 25-100.

Here's a video of the new P90 if you haven't seen one yet: [https://youtu.be/HZrXNamJEQ4?t=1m18s](https://youtu.be/HZrXNamJEQ4?t=1m18s)",FortNiteBR

I played it at a friends house and that's when I fell in love. Unfortunately the game is 23GB and continues to increase by each update - for someone like me with ""potato internet"" this is a huge problem that's like the only thing holding me back from getting Fortnite. I cap around 5-10mbps and sure I could leave it overnight but it wouldn't be done even then. 

I'm not here to only complain about the size of Fortnite but how the creators/developers don't seem to be conscious of how large the game actually is there has been no effort to reduce its size it seems. I'm not sure if you can even get any results out of compressing the game. The game just gets bigger in size and it's affecting the uh, minority with copper connections. And finally, that leads me to question, is all of it necessary to your experience of Fortnite?

I  was thinking earlier of ""Minimalistic Fortnite"" where first, an option that only downloads what you need and you can request what you want as optional rather than it coming with the game. In this mode everything should be minimal, no fancy interface until you request that fancy interface, something that makes Fortnite smaller or ""less modern""/ ""detailed"" for those who can't handle it but does not give you a competitive advantage.

This has been a problem for me for a long time and i'm happy to be able to talk about it now. ",FortNiteBR

It took a lot for me to know my builds and now 8 out of 10 players I encounted will either shoot right away when I build (they wont build anything) or when we build battle and I get a one floor and stairs high ground on them they would turn into w key and shoot your smg warriors when underneath me.

C4 buff, weakening mats amounts mildy, removing drop off against buildings, Rpgs acting like c4s when fired, recently the excessive smg meta, high fire rate and shredding against builds, and now literally giving less starting and total health for wood and brick so its even EASIER to go for the breaking that try to build. 

And for the record, this will only inhibit the speed at which people come up with magnificent new building outplays and ideas, it will move slow as ever when all that matters is trying to block bullets by spamming weak healthed structures.

No, the game is not dying and wont be for a while, but I already saw some comments from old players that had enough of it, and let me tell you, the moment a popular streamer goes public in his hate to the building nerf and backs it up by quitting to play it, it will spiral to really bad things with people following along, and then it might start to die.

Now don't get me wrong Fortnite is a fantastic game, but i think there are many problems that epic isn't addressing and in place of what they should do and fix the problems they add more stuff to the game to bring more players back and make more money. There are many problems i think Epic should fix, for example Epic keep adding smgs to the game, i think they should be fixing the shotguns with how a lot of the time you can get head shots that do less than 50 damage. I also think that should change/update the damage drop off system. I think that it is to harsh with damage drop the revolver does 30 damage depending what rarity it is, another problem i have encounted is mid game. Mid game in Fortnite is now the BIGGEST PISSTAKE. I was just in a game and first zone hast even started coming in and there was only 29 people left, with the addition of paradise palms and lazy links i think the map is to filled up there are to many options to go making a lot of people die at the beginning.

I personally feel like Epic games is making the game to easy for new people to start playing and start winning, with the Over powerd SMGs, you now don't need to learn how to be good with a shotgun all you need to do is spray and pray.

In conclusion i personally thinks epic games are being money hungry and just keep updating to game to attract more people to it and making it easier so new people don't get discourage. These new people will eventually buys skins earning epic money quick money.

P.S This is just a start of what i have to so, no means am i saying this is a bad game i am just pointing out errors that epic will hopefully fix.

Gaming and the Impact on Students: Pastoral care in our school is a growing need. We have many students who are coming to us with such a wide variety of concerns around their own wellbeing and that of their friends. We hold an open door policy and Senior Management and staff are always available to the students to talk to. When the need arises we refer them to agencies who can better support them and their families when dealing with anxiety and situations out of our school expertise.

One of the greatest causes of anxiety that we are currently encountering is caused by the game 'Fortnite'. This game is designed for aged 8-18 children and unfortunately we are seeing younger children 'playing this game in the playgrounds and discussing how many others they have 'killed' after jumping out of the plane (one game scenario). The impact on the older students is more concerning. The division between those that play and

at don't, the anxiety as students are ganging up in the game) and targeting the same child over and over again. The tiredness of students as they 'game' until the early hours of the morning

\- unbeknownst to their parents much of the time.

On a positive note, unlike games similar to 'Call of Duty' which we know some of our students play, even though they are well underage, Fortnite has a lack of blood and gore and has a simpler cartoon quality. However the killing of one's friends at such a young age should be brought to question.

To see the game for myself I have been playing these

holidays. As I signed up I noted that not once was I asked for my age. As a gamer for many years (I am that geek!) I tried to put myself in the shoes of a young

es, I enjoyed the lower level graphics, they were so inviting, and for the first day I actually only encountered three other characters, however I soon found myself wondering as | axed someone to death and watched them simply disappear what impact that would have on them; have they lost yet again? As I shot someone with bullets, how many hours have they spent trying to get that far into the game? I have also found the 'chat' side very questionable - you may definitely wish to monitor this area of the game!

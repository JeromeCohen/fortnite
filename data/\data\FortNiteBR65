First off, here's a list of the things it's been destroyed by:

Meteor
The cube (also known as lovable Kevin)
An earthquake

Now I wasnt too involved with fortnite before season 6 but I have played since I think season 1, mabye I started at season 2.

Either way, one of my best memories from back in the day was an old ltm that hasn't returned since it's 1st appearance, the Leviathan ltm. And during it at one point I saw a faint glow come from the Leviathan and head towards tilted.  I was close so I got to tilted as quick as possible and the building had a faint glow that went away after a bit.

My theory is that the Leviathan for whatever reason cursed the land plot of the building in tilted.

So what do you guys think? Could it be a possible that the Leviathan actually did this? And if so why? Leave your thoughts in the comments below.",FortNiteBR

Last week I tried Fortnite again and I loved it. My building was a bit rusty but it was still a lot of fun. There's so many ways to outplay someone. I was hooked. But although I was hooked, I noticed that I would usually end up tilting when playing Fortnite, as opposed to when I play Apex or Rocket League. 

I started thinking about it and I think that it's a few things. Sometimes you just die and you really can't do anything about it. I get that it's a Battle Royal and there will be campers etc, but at least in Apex you can use Bloodhound to scout if you have a suspicion that a team is camping. There's also no number so if you get the enemy low and spectate that's all you can see. It's a lot less frustrating than literally seeing your enemy ""1"" in Fortnite(ofc that's changed with the 50 shield on a kill but you can still quick maths.) There's also the fact that building just doesn't come out sometimes (PS4, but I'm assuming it's the same on PC) and there's also some micro stutters. But what's really frustrating is when you hit a shotgun shot which clearly should have done significant damage, and hit them again for 90 shield, and then die, only to realize that the first shot never registered.

This NEVER happens in Apex or Rocket League. They both work how they're SUPPOSED to.

Epic, you have one of the biggest games, if not the biggest, games in the world. You created this game using your own engine. It's been a year and a half. PLEASE fix your game. You have millions of players, millions of debug codes, and for christ sake it's your own engine. PLEASE focus on JUST a PERFORMANCE UPDATE!!! It's about damn time.",FortNiteBR

Console:Xbox and ps4 going against each other has made this game so much more fun for me so this i dont have any problem with. What i do have a problem with is when the tournaments/pop up cups are 99% pc ttv btws and the 1% and console players...while i do respect pc players this just is unfair to us controller players.

PC:The PC community has been getting so much more toxic nowadays that they complain about getting killed by any gun and say ""Nerf"" or ""Vault it"" on of these examples is Tfue when he said ""ill support fortnite skins if they remove bursts"" and then what happened next? VAULTED...also These TTV players are really whats wrong with this game spamming ""USE CODE *Code*"" or ""THESE KIDS ARE BOTS"" and even a classic excuse for getting killed ""Sweatys""

New Players:They legit leave the game because of the rng and skill gap...thats it

Switch/Mobile:I recently got the s10 and wanted to play mobile but couldent help to notice some switch players on my team. This is a welcome addition because they are the newest platforms and they were meant to be. HOWEVER when i bring up switch i get REMINDED OF HOW BAD IT RUNS. Which brings me to my next and final topic

Updates/Performance:When i first saw fortnite on switch i was mildy dissapointed because it is not optimized to its max potential. If fortnite mobile can run 60 fps why cant switch? *I know its resolution is different let me have this one* Switch is at a disadvantage with its 30 fps which btw is inconsistent and drops frames every 5 seconds or so when building or shooting...Epic keeps pushing content updates and adds stupid crap instead of focusing on the games performance....And thats me not even talking about all the bugs...oh boy thats another story

If u made it this far thank you for reading please leave comments i love feedback

Now, here we are and the Disruptor is out tonight. I love it, but only almost.

Absolutely, my 2 favorite gliders in the game are the Coaxial Copter and Diverge. I love how they are aircraft/vehicle inspired rather than modified with bottom mounted handle bars.

I just find it hard to grasp why we have the sleighs, car and now 2 aircraft that could technically be stood or sat in yet we dangle from them. Yes, I know the cockpit is a bit scaled on the Disruptor, that's an aside. In my opinion they dont fit in the Fortnite world. 

Don't get me wrong, I do like them aesthetically and really wanted to like the Chopper with guns, but damn it why can't they all be inspired. If we can sit or stand in them, there shouldn't be a spot to do so.

We have gliders in fortnite. Can we please keep the all of the amazing ideas to inspiration? 

Am I being petty or do y'all even understand what I'm getting at?

Everything else would be the same as a normal game. I.E. materials, health, jump boosts, weapons, and other things.

In this game mode, players spawn at a random Point of Intrest at the start of the game, slightly above the ground to allow you to chose a more specific spot for the POI that you spawned at. For example if you spawned in Tilted, you might chose to go Clock Tower instead of Trump.The amount of people per POI depends on how many chests spawned in that location that game. One game 2 people could spawn there, the next there could be 5, it all depends on chest spawns.

Since the game starts with everyone on the island, the first circle moves in more quickly to compensate for the drop time being non-existent, however the first circle is bigger and is more centered on the map to so there are less RNG related deaths.

Supply Drops also don’t appear in this mode, because it’s assumed that the bus drops supply drops later in the match, even though it isn’t seen. To compensate, floor loot gets increased.

Maybe a Bus Driver skin could release along side this LTM, with rewards for his glider, which would be a mini battle bus?

Here would be what some challenges could look like:
Win Matches of the Crashed Bus LTM 0/1 Reward: Battle Bus Glider
Play Matches of the Crashed Bus LTM 0/5 Reward: Battle Bus Spray
Open chests in the POI you spawned at 0/10 Reward: Bus Parts Contrail (Mechanical Parts come out of your hands)",FortNiteBR

I’m not great, but am far from a default. 

Anyways, this conversation stems from me constantly hearing good players called sweats. Mainly from my brother, I always thought it was kinda annoying. Like “they are better than you, get over it.” 

**But the more I play and the more I read this subreddit** 

It’s the same thing, every good player from here to Vietnam is being called a sweat. 

For me, it’s a debate of what is and where can you be a *casual*. Fortnite really has one game mode, the standard BR. Which is what my point is on. Fortnite doesn’t have SBMM, or at least nothing much as like a ranked playlist (gauntlets excluded, that is a tournament after all). So the “sweats” can’t hop into a ranked game where it would “make sense” to try hard. They have to play the normal game mode, where they can in theory get matched with anyone of any skill level. 

Which is where you come in, players. You get matched against these players, and inevitably die against them, call them a sweat, leave game, queue again, repeat. But deep down you know they are just, to put it simply, *better* than you. And since there is only one game mode, they aren’t just going to not play. 

So can we stop this please it’s actually annoying and y’all are petty as shit. Thank you for reading all of this, I typed it during school.",FortNiteBR

That's really when Fortnite started kicking off. We had the rocket event, theories that a new space map would come, the classic John Wick skin, everyone thinking that tilted towers was going to get destroyed by an asteroid, etc. I do feel like that's when Fortnite really started peaking fast.

I have played video games regularly for over 14 years now, and Fortnite is one of the few games I have ever played where the skill gap is so insanely high. I have never got so tired playing a game just to keep up or get better.

For someone who doesn't play Fortnite everyday, because I have so many games that I am busy with, I feel like I am required to play this game everyday just to keep up with sweats or good players. Every match I play, instead of expecting to have fun, I expect to find players who would already build an Empire State in front of me before I could even empty a full AR mag, and personally, this has been turning so many of my friends and I away from the game. They have moved to Apex or other games because you don't have to try so hard just to have fun or even win.

A few hours before I post this, my friend and I hopped on Fortnite after a month and a half break from Fortnite. Not only did we struggled, we feel worn out just to keep up with people outbuilding us.

This may be a controversial comparison, but I'd like to compare with Call of Duty. CoD was such a casual game that any hardcore or new players could pick up and play. I can play CoD for 3 years, stop playing for 5 months, and go back and still have fun and not worry about having to keep up with someone who plays everyday. Fortnite is not that game because of the skill gap.

So, to conclude this post, just to summarize everything. This game, for a Fortnite casual like me, feels like a chore to play because it's hard to enjoy the game. I don't have the energy to build battle everyone I fight. I don't have the energy to learn how to mash all the buttons on my controller flawlessly in Playground. For any casual who wants to enjoy this game now, well, good luck with that.",FortNiteBR

Just kidding, what I mean is, don't flatten out the points at zero, let the score go into the negatives.

What I am saying is only from the perspective of the average casual player that wants to play with similar skilled players.

A zero player now may be, everything from a zero kill points, zero positioning points per match player, to a two kill points and zero positioning points player.  
Basically a 0 K/D and a 2 K/D, and those two are NOT the same thing.

Of course there should be other adjustements, such as a less strict matchmaking in the negatives, since your -45 points player should expect to play with somewhat higher skilled players but should not expect to wait for more than a couple minutes before playing. 

Another thing that I'd do is that when in the negative points the bus fare should be more a playing fare, being subtracted after a certain amount of gameplay (as an example, first kill, a given time on the ground, a quota of mats gained, whatever comes first) and not right after the start, to make artificially lowering one's score a little harder.

TL;DR Limiting the lower score at zero flattens the player too much in the low end resulting in zero lobbies being a bit too harsh, let us go into the negative.",FortNiteBR

People hunting rifle killing you from point blank range, going through every single edit in the span of two seconds, building the Seattle sky needle just for one kill etc. 

The gauntlet solo test event is up and running as we speak but that hasn’t stopped the abundance of try hard from finding their way into regular solo mode and going batshit crazy just to kill you. Disco domination or some type of respawn ltm for solo would be awesome. I stopped playing for the past week because of how it’s borderline impossible to get a win unless you play passively. I would absolutely love for rank play to be a thing but at least filtering out the sweats for people who want a casual experience would greatly benefit a lot of people. It would also give those who play by themselves an opportunity to get better. I can’t tell you how many times I see people on this sub asking for a training partner because they get destroyed in solo but don’t have anymore to play duo/squads with. 

So epic I urge you not to neglect the solo games. It’s been god awful since the season has started and I’m at a point where I’ll only play squads with my cousins, won’t bother playing the game otherwise. I’m just tired of having to sit 2 inches from my screen and my hand being drenched in sweat after every match just to get one or two kills. I used to be able to drop 7-9 fairy easy, now I can’t drop more than 5 and I’m putting in WAY more work than I used to. Almost 10000 games under my belt and I’ve finally accepted that you can’t really get good at an ever-changing game so I don’t want to be good, I just want to have fun.

Today I will talk about why we need skill based matchmaking. Lots of defaults are joining and there was a huge rise around Christmas and other holidays since people were getting consoles as gifts and PCs as well. But most of these players couldn’t improve since they’re put against good players/sweats. And the amount of wins better players got and sweats got increased by a lot due to these people. I think people should be grouped by win/loss ratio as well as kill/death ratio, and even hours played. This will make decent players get better and into better leagues and newer players as well into decent players instead of getting smashed by pros every game. And it will make the pros work harder for their wins, making them more respectful of players instead of thinking they’re the best of something. I hope you guys who read this can understand and help me reach this cause. I’m a decent player myself, but want to make this game fair.",FortNiteBR

And just by saying my own personal opinion in this subreddit, I know I'm going to get downvoted or have this deleted by mods. (Which I have read the guidelines and I don't seem to be breaking them.) But I just want to get my point across: Stretched doesn't help you. It might make people's hitboxes bigger, sure, but in a game like Fortnite with so much bloom, it also makes your crosshair bigger. Sure, in games like Rainbow Six Siege it actually helps because there's literally no bloom if you zoom in, but Fortnite has so much bloom that it just does nothing. This means, yes every 11 year-old TTV soccer skin, it doesn't help you. All it does is make your game look like crap. It literally makes your game nauseating to watch. And every streamer who plays stretched res, you're making your viewers not want to watch because your game does, in fact, look like crap. And why should I care about this? Well, I really don't if it's honestly what you want to do, but I am tired of clips and streams with stretched. It looks terrible and they're usually such good clips too! And some streamers aren't half bad but they used stretched, and I don't watch them because it makes me want to vomit. Also, I don't even want to bring this up but I have to, but people who use it generally don't improve. They're just saying it makes them better, but they don't realize that it just makes their viewing experience worse and probably makes them even slightly worse too.

Apologies to any mythology nerds if I get anything incorrect, and if I do let me know!  
(I will be summarizing so I will not be including most characters from mythology in my theory)

Also, I will be naming the skin Ragnarok, Ragnarok, and I will name the Norse Event, Ragnarök with the Norse ö.

Table of Contents
1. What is Ragnarök?
2. The Cube/Rift
3. The Ice King/Ice Storm
4. The Vikings at Snobby Shores
5. The future; war?

1. What is Ragnarök?
To start things off, this topic has been discussed before for many seasons due to the ragnarok skin, but I think it means much more than just signaling the ice king (another theory from season 7).  For starters, we are talking about the Norse event, Ragnarök, not the skin. Ragnarök is an apocalyptic event in Norse Mythology where the world comes to an end, and a new one rises from the void. Many events lead up to this point, from the world being plunged into eternal darkness, to the world being sent into a deep year long winter, and then the world being plagued by a war between gods, burnt to a crisp, flooded and everything ever created is at its end........ 

So now you may ask, how does this link to anything?Well, let’s dig deeper..

2. The Cube/Rift
The Rift. The main event of season 5 that connected multiple dimensions to the fortnite world. Many things came from this rift; the desert, lazy links (f), but most importantly for the theory, the Viking Village. These Vikings arrived in the fortnite world, and brought their home with them. The Vikings were not talked about, or shown in any loading screens or art for the season. But the Vikings DO have a purpose, they brought their harbinger, Ragnarok. While it is never emphasized, I believe that Ragnarok was brought to the world to fulfill his destiny, but we will talk about that later.—————&gt; Fast Forward a bit and the rift spits out our wonderful friend, Kevin the Cube. Kevin placed runes all around the map, and finally dissolved into loot lake. These chain of events all lead to the Cube rising from the lake, and bringing darkness to the map in season 6: darkness rises. Note the wording, ‘darkness rises’. Remember what I said about the world being plunged into darkness in the first paragraph? Keep that in mind, this is our first link, the Cube brought the first stage of Ragnarök, eternal darkness.

Now that we know that the cube brought the first stage of Ragnarök, now we must get into the second stage, the year of endless winter...

3. The Ice King/Ice Storm 
After the darkness of our friend Kevin fell, a mysterious iceberg/glacier appeared at the southwest corner of the map. The sudden appearance of this iceberg is quite random in the storyline, but there is an explanation, and it all ties back to the Vikings. Ragnarok (the skin) has a certain wording in his skins description: “the cold harbinger of fate”. The definition of a harbinger is someone or something that signals or announces the approach of another. The idea is that ragnarok signaled the approach of the ice king this whole time. ————&gt; Now we fast forward a bit, and the ice king has regained his ‘powers’ and he brings forth the Ice Storm. The Ice Storm was a winter event in season 7 where you had to fight off the ice legion, and the entire map was covered in snow for 10 days (may not sound that long, but event-wise it was a very long event). Remember the year long winter I referred too in the first paragraph? Yeah, that was the ice storm, a year of deep, eternal winter.

Now we know that the second stage of ragnarök has already happened, what’s next?

4. The Vikings at Snobby Shores
It is now season 8. The prisoner created the jungle biome, the volcano, and pirates have arrived. But something else is stirring at the Viking village we are all familiar with. The Vikings are attacking snobby shores! Currently they have conquered one house and will likely conquer the rest of Snobby Shores throughout the season. But what does this have to do with anything you ask? Well remember, ragnarök ends in WAR. The Vikings must be trying to expand their land, and they could possibly be preparing for something big, and soon. Perhaps a war between kingdoms?

5. The Future: A War?
We are now in the present. The future has many possibilities. But we have theories and ideas to find our what it could hold. In the Norse Event, a war leads to the entire world being burnt from fire, and finally flooding. But it was not the end. A brand new, and better world  rose from the seas. With this information, we can guess what will happen this season. I believe that there will be a war between the ice king and the fire king, and maybe even the Vikings and the pirates. This war will have great consequences, leading to the eruption of the volcano, and changing the map forever, or possibly, ending it, and creating a whole new map.

TLDR: The fortnite: battle royale map is going through the ancient Norse event: Ragnarök, and has been since season 5. This will lead to a war, which will lead to the eruption of the volcano, which will lead to the end times: a new map, or the biggest map change yet.

So, it is strictly based on past performance. How do I know? Over the past months I always notice I do better the first couple of games I get on and then start to get destroyed and move back down to worse lobbies. I have played 20 games today and I have died multiple times without getting a kill and moved down to a noob lobby. Call it a coincidence that:

1. I had a default skin with a pickaxe and no gun after 5 min.
2. Guy didn't place walls around supply crate.
3. Guy hid in bush even after I was right in front of him. 
4. No one I faced was even half decent at building. I got 8 kills in Fatal upon landing.
5. This was all one game!!

Now reasons why you may think this is false?

Either you are so new to the game to the point where the people who are ""good"" at the game are killing you or you have what happen to you that I explained above in the paragraph. ",FortNiteBR

so recently there has been a lot of people complaining about the new baller vehicle in fortnite. everybody can 100% agree that the new ball is a lot fun to use, sure sometimes if you try and shoot somebody in them they can escape really easily, but its not like they can really shoot at you or do any significant damage. the people complaining about the ball don't care how harmless they are in public games because in competitive (skip to next paragraph if you don't care about competitive) they're getting away with free mobility while being completely protected without the use of building, this is a huge advantage to the 5 - 20 players who are using the baller because the rest of the players who are all trying to make it to the next safe zone in a tiny ass circle with around 20 - 50 players inside all looking to kill each other with a constantly moving storm that is shrinking, the players not inside of the balls are all slowly using up all of their materials, which about 90% of the time, they cannot replenish from other players they eliminate due to the need to be constantly moving, watching around you for other players and building.

so if you don't care about competitive that's completely fine, but epic are pouring millions of dollars into this and there are people who do care and are working hard to compete. the balls(like many items) are causing problems in competitive games, no matter how much you try to argue that they are fine just like some people did with planes, c4, the drumgun, the infinity blade, the heavy sniper and a lot of other items.

the reason they may not have been causing problems for you is because some of these things were actually fun and didn't matter in public games that were just for fun. epic adding the pop up cups, and more recently the gauntlet cup which is available for players looking to play against players of their own skill level whenever they want. I personally think thats dope, i'm nowhere near as good as a lot of these ""sweats"" and ttv's, but i love seeing good players play against each other, and i love to give the pop up cups a go whenever i have time, i stay up to date with a lot of the pros and like to think i have a decent idea about what goes on in competitive games, and that I have an idea about what does and doesn't work, and honestly i think they just need to make one more big change to competitive playlists which is giving it its own limited loot pool.

the meta in the game as a lot of you know is getting in burst damage and building, usually with a pump. I've seen lots of casual players complaining about this and that is why i think this would be a great idea. I think that competitive playlists should remove all of the gimicky items and not so useful ones in a way that still provides somewhat of a variety and choice to the player, but also eliminates as much randomness, luck or RNG as possible. I'm really not sure what should and shouldn't be taken out, as there is a fair bit of debate around snipers, things like boogie bombs, minigun, balloons, maybe all grey weapons, I don't know. whatever makes the game more about skill, and less about how lucky somebody is.

most items like planes, quad launcher, drum gun and the double barrel were removed because pro players and streamers were complaining about how broken and powerful they were, eventually the community agreed with them. i may be wrong about this part but i honestly don't think it would matter if the regular playlists were unbalanced if there was a competitive playlist available 24/7 that only offered a selection of weapons that weren't as powerful as maybe the double barrel or drum gun, just regular pumps and AKs/scars. maybe epic could tweak some of those things and put them back in the regular games. it could lead to the regular playlists having a bit more of a casual feel. i really don't know how i feel about a lot of the vaulted items being back in the game, i'd probably only play the competitive mode which is why i think its a necessity for epic to keep it around 24/7 if they made this change. but i know if i just wanted to mess around without taking things too serious i could just go into the regular mode and ram my plane into people or something, i don't know, if you think its a good idea then cool, but if not then please let me know why",FortNiteBR

No, you didn't die to a bot, you died to someone who clearly has equal or more skill than you at the game.

Stop acting like you're better than everyone else, because you're not.

You may be good. Hell, you may even be incredible, but for every one incredible player you know about there are 10 equally as incredible players you DON'T know about.

I don’t feel nearly as confident while playing just because of the sheer amount of good players in the lobbies. Literally consistent build fights everywhere, which is fine it’s the way the game is suppose to be played but it wasn’t like this before cross play. Of course you’ll inevitably come across a talented players, but again cross play seems to have changed the entire feel of the matches. 

Does anyone feel the same way? Also was there even a reason that they merged the two consoles? It made sense for mobile and switch but PlayStation and Xbox have large player bases and the game is stable.

But literally nothing you do will beat someone who's accurate with the pump shotgun.

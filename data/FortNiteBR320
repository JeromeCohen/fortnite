It’s been tiring seeing the exact same skins come into the shop 5 or 6 times in the course of a season, with some skins coming out once and never again. It’s understandable that EPIC would try to make some skins “Limited Edition,” (Like the skull trooper, Crackshot, E.C.T,) but skins like the power chord and battle hound have been absent from the shop for no apparent reason. It’s also started an economy online of people dishing out hundreds for a single skin or account and has led to countless scammings.

I am profound deaf gamer. I only played it for almost a week since I started and even bought battle pass. Anyway. I noticed myself that I usually struggle with being killed from behind or not even noticing enemy shooting at me. I bought a device called Woojer The Strap. This device is to be worn on body and it create vibrations according to sounds from tv, movies, Netflix, and games. Only issue with this is it can't filter out certain noise so I had to turn off some sound in sound setting. But even with it I still struggle because I can't tell if there are gunfire nearby in distance and often it happen in long distance which I can not see. I barely can feel footsteps but most of time it is only my footsteps. 




I have been considering buying a gaming sound card that come with Sonic Radar program but I felt like I hit the brick wall when too many players with hearing ability claimed it as cheating program. **I can understand where they come from, but even so it is still unfair to deaf and hard of hearing players because players with great hearing ability have great advantage over deaf and hard of hearing players. So this would be useful tool for us as deaf and hard of hearing players** Price for this a simple program is kinda steep for me and gaming sound card is even useless for me expect for program itself that comes with. So I would like to see Fortnite developers their view on this program.



The issue with Sonic Radar beside ""considered"" cheating is accessibly. Not everyone can buy cards or motherboards that equipped with this program. So I thought of something better. I don't know if you played PUBG on phone but I do and I often survived more than on PC because of minimap showed footsteps nearby and gunfires as well. So I wonder if Fortnite developers are willing to consider to add this feature to all consoles and PC? It would be very useful to all deaf and hard of hearing players. What do you think?

I think that building becoming the only way to be good at the game, changed the game from what it was at the very beginning, and not definitely for the better. The game used to be a lot less focused on building, and it was almost more relaxing than the building fest it is now. Me and my friends would hop into games and we wouldn’t build anything besides 1 wall and 1 stairs in gunfights, and the opposing squad would generally do the same. We could have coordinated strategies and could outsmart the opponent or outgun them.

The game now is just a buildfest that has ALMOST no real strategy involved. The winner of the fight is always who is better at building, and it is just a not relaxing, frantic build battle where by the end of it you have a crazy and complicated remains of the frantic battle.  I think this promotes skill, but it loses a lot of the strategy that I feel the game used to require.

This is just my 2 cents. I still love the game, and I enjoy the building mechanic, just not the way that it has turned it into a frantic mosh pit where the best builder always wins the day",FortNiteBR

At least with the minigun you have to have your own ammo to go with it (and the ammo that drops with it isn’t a crazy amount)

I think it’d be much less annoying if it started with less ammo when you first pick it up. Like you can still load 100 bullets into it, but only 60 or so would actually be in it when you pick it up.",FortNiteBR

You have to make a decision, do I gather enough materials for a base, or do I take my chances on the ground. When everyone choose the sky base it makes for an epic time. It creates such a unique way to fight, because one step and you don’t die, but you might fall to the ground and stay there. If you choose the ground, it’s the same thing as not building in a regular battle on the ground. The person above will have the advantage, and you have to use your own skill and wit to find a way to win it back.

But let's just be honest... those guys aren't the ones hitting long-range snipes.  

In addition, I am sure there is a way to balance the damage/rate-of-fire/magazine size of this weapon so that it would not be OP.


The downfall of the Auto-Sniper is as follows:

1) The one-hit kill potential is incredibly low, and any capable enemy can quickly build/find cover after you land the first shot. 
                            
2) Because of the useful distance requirement put in place by the high-power scope, you can't take advantage of an opportunity to push after your first shot.

3) It doesn't fill any niche weapon category, due to the Scoped AR and Bolt-Action being vastly superior in overlapping ways.

In the end, the Auto-Sniper's most useful function is broadcasting your position to everyone in the area.

Personally, I think the wide range of ways to win is part of what makes FortNite great.  Adding a silenced rifle would fill a completely uninhabited weapon category, and create yet another unique angle to play.

The largest consensus I see in this sub is their hate for the ""harvesting grind"".   People love the boost to material harvesting in the Blitz game mode.  My opinion is that it is not the lack of the harvesting boost that is the core issue, but the length of storms and storm countdowns.  

After the initial drop, there can be huge periods of lulls and lack of engagements.  That is the bigger issue.   There can be a serious lack of engagement for long periods of time which is the root cause of the grind feeling. I imagine cutting off even 30 seconds off the early storms would be a step in the right direction. It would encourage more engagements more frequently, which would at least lead to material accumulation via eliminations. The harvesting boost in Blitz is a little too much with current storm behavior. The Blitz boost to material harvesting alone would be way way too much.  Everyone would high to max levels of materials for 15\-20 minutes of the game.  Effective usage of materials should remain a core component of Fortnite.

Current solo games can stretch out to 25 minutes.  That is a long game.  I think the focus should be on reducing the max game length to closer to 20 minutes.  Making blitz the normal game mode is not the best idea.  You would be reducing the entire map by a certain &amp;#37;.  Some POIs would become obsolete.

Back near the begenning of S2 i just switched from battlefield 1 and rocket league on controller.

However it seemed like most of the playerbase was bad too, so I didnt feel too bad and I eventually got my first win using a scar at close range. I had minecraft skills for building.

Fast forward to now, at least 1 player in the top 5 is good at building and I have to really pull off some of my best edits to outplay them. The noobs of season 1 and 2 are all good now and there is at least 2 in every lobby who will win the game, leaving little chance for the other 98.

My proposal is to have 2 types of fill lobbies, people who have 1 solo win and people who do not have a solo win. If you can win a solo, then you have a good enough understanding of the game to be put in the same lobby against the players who have many wins already. It will also make it so that new players can have a good time in solo instead of getting massacred by good players before they even land.

Also, only those who have won a solo should be eligible for solo showdown. This makes it slightly more competitive so a good player wont get matched against a bunch of noobs in the lobby.

Why even bother getting 200 health when 1 shot from a shotgun can end you. No other close range gun can compete because of this. Even so, why do we allow ourselves to have this in the game? It is not the least bit fun nor exciting to 1HKO opponents or die to it ourselves.

You CANNOT nerf the pump without making it useless. It grants a 1 hit kill for a good range and at great speed with 2 equiped.

My idea is to bring balance to all weapons in the game and that is to Dump the Pump Shotgun and Buff the Heavy. 

Suggestion 1:

The Pump is better than the Tac in both consistency and range. Therefore give a bit of both these qualities to the Tac.

Buffs: SLIGHTLY tighten the spread on the Tactical Shotgun.

This is for consistency and slight range in shots. The Blue Tactical does 180+ on a headshot meaning if you so much as take a bullet as you were pushed you will be in OHKO range for the Tac. Perfectly fair you were outplayed. The Tac has less range than the pump and will be only useful for up close as it should be. This indirectly buffs both Smgs and Pistols for their better range.

Suggestion 2:

The Pump outclasses the Heavy Shotgun in one way only: Damage.

Buffs: Increase the damage of the Heavy shotgun to 197 a headshot and SLIGHTLY tighten the spread.

If the Heavy Shotguns remain of Epic and Legendary rarity. Then then only thing that must be done is to increase the Damage to 197. Therefore in most encounters the potential to OHKO an opponent remains. If they so much as take storm damage, take a bullet, or even not care to fill shield to 100 then they can and should still be one hit killed.  

These suggestions also fits with the rarity of the Heavy Shotgun. Your reward for finding a rare shotgun is longer range than  the Tac and extremely dangerous potent shots. While this new Heavy may not seem as much better than the Tac in comparison it does allow better balance in not making the TAC feel useless compared to the double Pump. Nor does it make it so some players have a crazy good advantage simply by finding one early game.

This change DIRECTLY competes with and does not replace the other close range weapons. Again, indirectly buffing the Smgs and Pistols.


I am of the belief that a shotgun round to the face should do an absurd amount of damage. OHKO even. However in this game it just doesn't seem to fit. People want to truly be and more importantly feel fairly outplayed. Being at 200 health should mean that you haven't made a mistake costing you health therefore are rewarded with the guarantee of not being one hit killed.

As entertaining as it was, it may be time to  dump the Pump and put it in the vault. Perhaps even do an LTM with these changes and see how the people feel about it. I'd  love to be proven wrong. 



Personal note:
I want to restate that this is for the development of the game. I want to see players truly outplay each other.  Double Pumping and searching for a split second opportunity to put out a 200+ dmg headshot has gotten stale. This is not truly satisfying for either player. 

Side notes:
Why not a Slug?

A slug would render Revolvers/Deagles useless. If they plan on keeping those in game.

Should Snipers be OHKO?

Yes.

Should the Semi-auto Sniper have a silencer?

I'm not the poster from this thread, but this is an issue with playing on PC that not only affects colorblind players, but players who don't like the dynamic crosshair or the default crosshair color.

I prefer using a static red dot in almost every other shooter I play on PC. The extra crap around the default crosshair throws off my aim, especially in long-range scenarios with AR's where I can't make out the target because the 4 dynamic crosshair lines potentially block my sight of the player before I can adjust my aim.

It's such a small change that I doubt would take a lot of effort to add into the game, and is not only keeps accessibility in mind for those who are colorblind, but helps out people who aren't as well and need the static crosshair for the sake of focus.",FortNiteBR

For those of you who don't know, this shooting model has no bloom and instead guns have recoil. This removes the luck element from shooting and makes it entirely skill based. With this model, ARs/SMGs are as reliable as you are skilled at aiming/controlling recoil. People would not be so tempted to push with a shotgun if they knew they could rely on their AR.

I think this model will eventually come to Fortnite, possibly due primarily to the competitive scene. At the Vegas tournament, Ninja lost a gunfight where he was clearly all over the guy, and got killed because bloom wasn't in his favor. He was cool about it and calmly explained that's what happened. When there is real money on the line and a pro loses a fight due to bloom, they will complain until Epic is forced to implement this or make a major change at least. That's my guess.",FortNiteBR

Let me start off by saying that I started playing Fortnite early October of last year (*around the same time that Destiny 2, my previous favorite franchise, was being flushed down the toilet*) and I instantly fell in love. I had never played a BR before and was not familiar with 3rd person shooters. I, like many of you, grew up with Halo and COD so this was a fresh experience for me. Everything in this game was so magical and I loved that the community was evolving week to week. I remember when a single wall followed by a ramp was all the building we needed. I remember when sky bases became the norm for many players end game and was an effective way to win. I remember when skull troopers weren't considered good players because of their skin. I remember hearing those obnoxious electric zappers from the next town over.

My point is that I, as well as many others, grew alongside this game. We all learned the game slowly. We all learned to build at the same time and evolved with it. Back then most of us just placed a few walls and ramps per match and a 3 story 1x1 meant you we're probably one of the best in the lobby. We all learned how to win... slowly (my first win was with 3 kills in wailing, using trees as cover).

About a week ago my childhood best friend (who never played before) hit me up to play, I couldn't have been more excited to teach him the ropes. After about 100 games with him this past week I can whole heartedly say this game in near impossible for new players. There's just so much to learn especially if you're new to BRs, 3rd person shooters. How to loot quick, how to manage other players in your landing zone, how to listen for footsteps and vertical audio, how to use 3P and right hand advantage, how to build, how to rotate to zone, not to mention how long it takes to develop game sense.. I could go on forever you guys get the point. 

As you all know, gameplay has evolved so much since the inception of this game. Players use building aggressively and the pace of the game is unbelievably faster than months ago. From the build to shotgun meta, the quick gun swapping, the use of mobility (launch pads, jetpacks)- I can see why getting into this game now and being curb-stomped by players that have been around can be so demoralizing. I just want to say **don't give up!** Keep grinding, that feeling of your first earned solo win, a clutch for your teammates or even outplaying a solid opponent are unmatched as far as gaming goes. 

All that being said I think its pretty evident why modes such as 50v50 are so popular (*coughpermanent 50v50coughcough*) Players can loot safely, they have plenty of allies and can get into actual midranges engagements to learn how to fight. **That playground mode can't come soon enough**, we really need an arena where players can learn the ropes without having to jump into games only to get one-pumped and not really gain any experience.

I know this was a long read for this sub as we're all used to dank memes, sick clips and beloved suggestion posts, but I want to thank the few of you that read this. Let me know what you guys think and if you've had similar experiences. I love this game and I love this community. Have a good one :)",FortNiteBR

I'm garbage at building and back in days that was fine because as long as I could build myself some type of cover I was fine but now a days that's not good enough. Literally every battle is a build battle  and I to admit it's really humbling to realize a good chunk of the player base (on console) can built circles around you. When I see I'm about to enter a build battle I just kinda up 10 seconds in and neither wait for the guy to come down for a regular shotgun fight or just straight leave entirely. Don't get me wrong I can build but not on massive Build Battle Level which is a problem because apparently everyone think they're Bob the builder. 

     Sometimes I get annoyed when someone just builds too much and just wait for them to realize they are wasting materials and come down and fight me. Like one example recently where I ran into a new skin. I didn't shoot at him or anything but as soon as he saw me he started building a city for a good 30 seconds. I just sat there watching him build not even trying to shoot him saying ""so are you gonna shoot at me or keep building?"" Then the storm came and he finally came down from his city only to get head shot by me. On that day I knew this wasn't the same forntie I knew before builder pro. Anyone have tips for build battles because I just can't keep having to back down in these situations.",FortNiteBR

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jJmQFBxA26N0I7ey69p8x8dK7zStQkUBAtxhIUB5ZTQ/edit?usp=sharing


**Notes on this Doc:**

To clarify, If you see a weapon in a column in which I won the match, It was the weapon I used to win the game with(I was not killed that game)

The time of day thing is classified as follows: Morning, before 11am central US time. Day, from 11am-5pm. Night, after 5pm.

If you're seeing 1's and 0's in the columns of the above spreadsheet it means yes(1) or no(0) most of the time. It's a fast way for me to highlight the numbers and get an average or a count, etc.


**My thoughts at the moment**

After taking a more than a month to finish 100 Matches at Moisty, here I am almost halfway home after only a few days days of dropping at Tilted.(As many of you predicted!) The presumed capital city on this god forsaken Fortnite island will break your spirit and humble you. If you land and don't get a gun and die three times in a row, its best to have a short memory. It's seemingly almost unavoidable. Buck up, Kiddo, and get back on the horse. 



The landing **IS EVERYTHING.** Getting down appears to be the single largest determining factor here, which seems obvious, but when you're going there 100 times in a row and tracking your statistics in this way... IT'S GLARING. I haven't quite mastered how to land/drop into this town but I'm improving. 


**Current Win Rate and KD**
4 wins = about an 8% Win Rate, and a 1.73KD. 
(Moisty was at 22 wins and a 2.05KD)



It's feast or famine at Tilted Towers. If I make it out of town, I have a shot to win the dang thing and finish pretty high typically. 


Something that can't be overlooked here is the general trend upward from the first half of these games played to the second half of games player so far. I really expect to play these next 51 games at a higher level after all the hard lessons I've learned from the first 49. 


**Follow the progress LIVE**
You can follow the above spreadsheet live update as I enter the results. 

You can also watch me get my face smashed in daily(Well probably for a few more days anyway) at Tilted Towers here: **https://www.twitch.tv/worstteamonline** or follow along on twitter **@WorstTeamOnline**, I am WadeToBlack on PS4.



**One Last Thing**
This subreddit has been overwhelmingly positive and welcoming to me, just some guy that thought he'd share a thing. It's been a lot of fun to see so many of you pop in and represent reddit on my last post and on the stream. Thank you.

Eventually, it boiled down to the pump shouldn't be able to deal 200\+ damage, and that the only weapon that should be able to one\-shot someone with full shield was a Bolt headshot. The other guy in this conversation stated that this just promotes 'campy and inactive' playstyles, when Fortnite should be about rushing and mega\-aggression. He went on to say that the Pump is fine where it is and needs no changes, since it requires very fine reaction time and precision to kill in one shot with it, but that the Snipers need changes.

I'm imagining a reduced damage profile would look like this:  
Bolt: 70/73.5/77, 175/184/192  
Semi: 42/44, 105/110 \(which is the damage it dealt before its buff way back when\)  
Hunting: 58/60, 145/150

Reasons for this:  
1. Apparently this promotes 'camping' and a more inactive playstyle, which is counter intuitive to the game's mechanics \(Storm, building, etc.\) as a whole.  
2. It would make end\-game fights more intense, because people would attempt to get closer and use other weapons.  
3. It would strongly enforce aggressive playstyles.

And now for why I am personally against this:  
1. Actually landing a sniper shot, let alone one to the dome, is one of the most difficult things to pull off in the entire game. If you get a headshot, it deserves to deal heavy damage or one\-shot the enemy.  
2. They are one of the only weapons that can deal decent damage at long ranges. Making the Bolt take three shots to the body just to kill someone at that distance is just ludicrous.  
3. Sniper shots and duels are very high profile; the sound that they give off is so loud that many people will be alerted to your position.

1. Skull Trooper is not coming out anytime before October. Accept it. EPIC doesn't give 2 shits about your 10th birthday, and how grandma gave you 20 dollars in rolled dimes to spend on FN. Pro Tip : that skin will not make you Myth. Quit dreaming and come back to reality. 

2. Double pumping, or shotguns in general, are never changing. We have bitched about the pump damage since season 1. They don't care. Get used to it or quit playing. Those are your 2 options.

3. Refunds are a privilege, not a right. Stop bitching that you ""accidentally"" bought a non popular skin. Nobody cares. It's yours forever. Embrace it. Next time pay attention. EPIC owes you nothing. They will never make an exception for you just because you cry on reddit. 

4. Jetpacks are not leaving till the end of the season. They suck dick, but they are here for the moment. Get used to it. 

P.S - stop asking about your level and just play the fucking game to 80. Nobody can tell you YOUR progression. If you dont get the fully upgraded skin, well, enjoy being partially put together.

My main account, has 100+ wins and a 3.5 KD season 4

My second account has 10 wins and 3 KD

My third account has 0 wins and a 1.2 KD

I've been play testing these accounts and while this seems to be largely false it comes up as an anomaly in my mind.

THE EXPERIMENT

I played 20 games on all 3 accounts, within the same time frame each day, dropping at the exact same spot every single game, Shifty Shafts. Solo squads every time. I did this to try and ensure the most accurate results but definitely there is going to be heavy deviation in the skill level because the chances of facing the same people each day is so miniscule.

THE RESULTS

First the numbers,

Main : KD 3.2 

Second : KD 3.5

Third: KD 5.6

Firstly, it felt like whenever I played on my third account, no one knew how to build or shoot, they would peek for years into my sniper shots. They would go for rezzes when I'm directly over them. Although, there were one or two squads late game which were organised and played well.

My main account however faced Myth Ninja and Tfue all at the same time, the players I played against were extremely hard to face against, I often lost repeatedly if I had to face early game. Towards middle game I felt like I faced a couple of squads whose players weren't up to the calibre of the other squads but they were still much organised.

My second account felt closer to my main rather than my third account, this possibly be because of the 10 wins the account has?

TL;DR 

I feel like there's skill based matchmaking but I trust epic with transperancy. I'm pretty sure I'm going batshit crazy and I'm losing my mind

- Door-BUG
- Crouchpeeking and Headglitching
- Ghostbullets
- Inconsistent Shotgun DMG
- People jumping through walls
- Tree-Hitboxes
- Jetpacks (super annoying to play against, spawns instead of a

- Clinger damaging you through walls  
- People teleporting with a 30ms ping and 0 package/frame loss

- Bloom and questionable Hit-reg
- micro stutter and overall worse performance over the last patches
- no in-game ladder or competetive mode (showdown is literally the same as solo)
- low xp on kills, which forces you to play passively 
- low trap damage
- no further motivation to grind for wins (unlockable weaponskins, some sort of badgets in the killfeed would be lit)

Has epic ever said that's what they wanted, it is a BR after all and i'm up for everything that allows the meta to evolve and add some more variety.

Again, it is a legendary item and in late game if you ask me about prefering to have rocket or jetpack, it would really depend on the situation which is good, since both are meant to be really strong items.

I am a competitive Fortnite player and recently I've been trying to get better with every types of grenades. I quickly realized that with the current meta, I just can't do that without having a real disadvantage, especially in showdown, the only form of competitive Fortnite so far.

There is my idea to see more grenades in Fortnite competitive games. Sorry if it has been posted before, I didnt see it. It deserves more posts anyway!

**Problem:**

Classic grenades, Impulse grenades, Boogie Bombs, Clingers, Remote explosives, and all futur types of nades... Do not have room in competitive players' inventory today. They can be fun and even very useful in specific situations, but they are just not worth trading for mini shields, snipers, grenade launcher, double pump shotguns...

This results into:

\- A very low usage, we just see few of them being thrown early game when it's the first thing you pick up

\- Epic having to buff them here and there because they should still be part of the game : balance issues

\- Epic probably wondering as well if it is even worth bringing new types of nades into the game

**Solution:**

Adding a new space in the current inventory would not fix anything. Other guns or more utility would still be more flexible in more situations. However, creating a **new specific case for grenades only** could work. The first grenade type picked up would automatically take the new grenade inventory spot, following grenades would go into the regular inventory.

Your thoughts?

Possible changes to the RPG:

•Damage Reduction.
I’m not a fan of this idea myself, I feel like the the damage output for this weapon is key and fairly well balanced and a reduction would nerf the weapon out of the game as it wouldn’t be able to perform its primary job of shooting down bases.

•Time before explosion increase.
This involves the rocket becoming a dud if it hasn’t been in flight long enough. I’m not talking it has to fly for 10s to explode, more 1.5-2s. 

•Travel X distance before explosion.
Similar to the last point, but instead of time it’s distance, whether it be 5 or 10 or X amount of metres the rocket has to travel before it can explode, otherwise again if it hits a surface after only traveling for 3m then the rocket is a dud and doesn’t go off.

Now, after playing Blitz and going back to Solo is just very slow. Beginning is fun, end game is fun, but mid game is very dry.

For Teams of 20 though. The storm is over powered. It's too fast and the damage is like being in the final shrink at end game of a regular solo match. A lot of matches end up with teams losing half or near all their members because of it. There's hardly much time to have a fight encountered on the way if the eye is going to shrink on the other side of the map say from Moisty to Junkyard for example if unlucky.

Alright so what started this was the loading screen wallpaper where the two Dino skins were hunting the Default skin like in Jurassic Park where the two raptors were chasing the kids. 

Now you look at Dusty divot, trees are growing around it and the alien rock has some sort of capsule in it. 

I think the capsule has alien dinosaurs or something in it, which will change the map in a new way. Dinosaur tracks, maybe a fossil challenge that gives you a bone axe 😱

Now the dinosaurs must come to an end so what better way to kill them off than a volcano explosion? It could add a lava field, bits of rock that you could mine (brick or maybe even a new building material, obsidian) the volcano could come out from a hill or one of the known mountains. You could paraglide or build down into it and find caverns with loot in it perhaps. (Which could open the possibility to more underground fighting opportunities in the future) anyway now that the volcano is there it could expand the island somehow since it erupted.

What if you could balance it a bit to add a small combo making it quicker, but at the same time make the normal combo slower. 
I got the idea from a game i played before and if you do the normal combo like you do on Fortnite, lets say switching between shotguns with the buttons 2 and 3, that’s all you have to do for the double pump to work.. But what if we make that combo slower so if you want a quicker double shotgun combo you can add the ”Reload shot”. What this does is that you have to press reload between every double-pump switch for the full capacity of it. So instead of doing 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3, you have to do 2 -&gt; R -&gt;3 -&gt; R -&gt; 2. This will make the double pump a bit more skillfull to use.

Only problem here i see is ps4/Xbox players can’t do the combo cause it’s harder with a controller but epic maybe can do some fixes to it there aswell!

It looked kind of furry and white? I kept shooting it because at this point I was just not taking any chances, but I really wish I had screencapped.

I killed it (it had around 200 health I think based on how many damage points it took) and when I ran over to loot it, there was nothing there. It just disappeared. 

I told this story to my friend and he didn't believe me, so I tried to Google it and see what it was but I haven't found any similar experiences. I promise I'm not crazy! Does anyone have any idea what it was? Just a strange glitch? Or is it a real thing that pops up from time to time?",FortNiteBR

Everyone wants to win. That’s why we play this game. But once you win often, you don’t just want wins, you want kills, you want action, you want a higher KD.

My usual landing spots consist of retail, fatal, anarchy and risky. I decided to drop tilted 50 games, and lonely 50 games and compared the two in terms of kills, placement, and wins. Mind you this is all in solos, so there will be more accurate results, as playing with a team can mean they steal your kills, or vice versa.

Before I begin, I think it’s important to establish how “good” my stats are. I’d say I’m above average, but not top tier, as I have 212 solo wins, a 2.75 KD in solos, and a 13% solo win percentage. 

In this experiment I will play like I normally do, which in my opinion is both aggressive (pushing everyone nearby early and mid game) and passive (building bases, not rushing them late game. I know, it’s a bad habit, I know I need to start playing aggressive at all times, but this is just my style)

RESULTS:

*TILTED* 
Average kills while still in tilted (dead or alive): 2.48
Average kills in one whole game: 4.26
Highest kill game: 15
Average placement: 39
Amount of wins in 50 games: 4
Win percentage: 8%
KD: 4.63

*LONELY*
Average kills while still in lonely (dead or alive): 1.5
Average kills in one whole game: 2.94
Highest kill game: 8
Average placement: 9
Amount of wins in 50 games: 15
Win percentage: 30%
KD: 4.2

In comparing the two, you can see that my kills per game in landing at tilted are higher but not by much. This is due to the fact that 1/4 of the time landing in tilted, I would die immediately without a gun. At lonely, I could loot with no pressure, leaving with the equivalent of what I would find in leaving tilted.

Going to tilted granted me with getting a couple kills for a few games, no kills the next couple, and then a game with a lot of kills. In lonely, I’d consistently leave with only one kill, and then hunt people with over half the lobby already gone, meaning less kills overall, and not a big chance at anything like a 20 bomb.

My KD was leveled out in both POIs simply because I would win often in going to lonely. This brought up my KD, but I found that beginning and mid game were just too boring and slow paced for my liking.

While I do love action, I personally hated landing tilted so many times. It just gives me anxiety and I feel like I fight best when I have a little time in between encounters to regather, reload all my weapons, and pop a couple minis. But nope, at tilted it was a cluster of action 24/7 and I hardly got anytime to regather myself.

Overall, my favorite thing about tilted was the high kill potential. I always dropped in hopes of getting a 20 bomb, but unfortunately that didn’t happen. I got 15 kills in landing here, my personal best. If you are looking for a high kill game, go to tilted.

My favorite part about landing lonely was the loot and the mushrooms. In landing here I’d always leave with what seemed to be 10 minis, 2 bigs, a pump and a blue AR or better, and many times I’d have a sniper or rpg (basically the perfect end game loadout already) and what made things better were the amount of mushrooms. You can literally get full shield with the amount of mushrooms here, it’s crazy. Getting a chance to get it all without any pressure before getting into fights. However, once I got looted up, it took so much effort to find people. I’d usually rotate into retail and then dusty, but by then more than half the lobby is gone. If you’re playing to win, go to places like lonely.

Overall, my KDs at both places are almost identical, yet my win percentage and average placement is much higher I’m going to lonely. Because of this, I can easily say that I won’t be going to tilted *unless* I’m in the mood to get a lot of kills. However, in an attempt to get said kills, I find it takes a few games to do so, meaning the kills level out to what I would have gotten if I went to lonely.

In the future, I’ll continue to land on the right side of the map and avoid all the chaos until I’m already looted, because overall, my KD won’t become lower, and my win percentage will actually become higher. 


TLDR: In dropping at both tilted and lonely, my KD seems to be nearly identical. This is because I’d get more kills and less wins at tilted, and less kills and more wins at lonely, meaning they level out in terms of KD. If you’re going for high kills, land tilted and prepared to get cucked a few times. If you’re going for wins, land lonely and prepared to be bored.",FortNiteBR

I started playing Battle Royale in the fall of 2017 and moved over to playing Save the World almost exclusively in early 2018. I wanted to take a couple minutes to answer some FAQ's that we get over there. My goal is to make this an advertisement for you, though, if you were thinking of making the jump over the Save the World, do it! I am glad I did and I don't even spend my V-Bucks on this side of the game.

#V-Bucks

This is the most common thing we see over there, people asking if you can earn a lot of V-Bucks playing StW. The answer is yes, you absolutely can. There is a major caveat, though, the game was meant to be played to earn the V-Bucks as part of the progression and nearing end game (there isn't much of one, though). StW was developed before BR, so the V-Bucks were meant to be a mechanic in that game and they happen to transfer over between games.

.

V-Bucks are used to buy llamas in StW which provide you with weapon schematics, survivors, new heroes and defenders. It is pretty hard to get a lot of new things without using V-Bucks in some capacity, so it is pretty core to the gameplay.

.

When you start playing the game there are several missions that provide V-Bucks, sometimes under a hundred, a couple in the hundreds or more. This tapers off significantly a bit later in the game, though. Each day you have a daily quest, similar to BR, that rewards at least 50 V-Bucks (only a couple reward more).

.

Once you get into late game (I have beat the main quest line, so I have access to everything) there are missions that show up on a 6 hour rotation which many can grant low amounts of V-Bucks. This quantity is 25, 30, 35 or 40. There are numerous of these per day. For the past several days I have been keeping track of them and completing them. You are able to earn about 315-375 V-Bucks a day with this. **In a 30 day month, that means that you can get 9,450 to 11,250 V-Bucks each month.** That is a lot of skins!

#BUT!!!!!!!!!

This takes a lot of game play to get to this point. As I mentioned, I just beat the main quest-line and I started on New Year's Day. I have played it quite a bit (as I love it) and you wouldn't have access to that unless you are playing the game hard for a month (like, literally 4-5 hours a day). Now, it is summer time and that may be the perfect opportunity, but I digress. 

.

This also takes focus and diligence to occasionally check on some of the resources like the Companion for Fortnite app or Stormshield.One website. It isn't too bad to do, and I use all my V-Bucks for StW, but there are other friends that spend them on BR.

#Game-Play

If you want to play the game, keep in mind that it is a wave based defense game. Many people play and scavenge a ton. I try to get the objective done as quickly as possible, but to each their own. If you are looking to maximize rewards like V-Bucks, the best way is to just play the objective and focus on that.

.

The game is incredibly well designed, IMO, but has a couple flaws. There are a large number of traps (I think 16 types), far more weapon designs than in BR (pistols that over penetrate and ricochet of walls, guns that shoot firecrackers, full auto snipers, full auto shotguns, swords, scythes, cool abilities and a lot more... and bears). **If you make the jump over, please keep in mind that this game is not BR. There are similarities, but it will hurt your experience to assume that they are the same and it should be given time like you would any other video game.**

.

If you are like me, you will start playing this game, love it and split your time or move over to it completely. If I do see you over there, please be respectful and don't be afraid to ask questions. The learning curve is steep and explained poorly at the start of the game (survivors are used to level up, no place explained that for some reason... and many more).

Fortnite is getting oversaturated with random items that make no sense, added for the sake of having more content. This can be random apples that fall from trees and restore health, mushrooms in a swamp that give you some shields, and SHOPPING CARTS that you can ride in. Some of these additions break the game, such as jetpacks. If this keeps up, Fortnite might be a dead game in a few years. Epic Games needs to get their it together and just fix the game, not add more random stuff to it. \(Pls fix servers Epic Games\) ",FortNiteBR

The person who killed them can now revive them and add them to their “team”. From that point on anyone in your team who revives someone adds the player to the overall team. Revive times would be shortened. It would be all about building your team and then trying to win. Teams would max out eventually though at 25 to keep some competition. If you’re on a team and go down, you die instantly. This would kick in after there’s 2 people on a team. ",FortNiteBR

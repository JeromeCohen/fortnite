Many of us really enjoyed playing the Zombies game mode on CoD and I think the mechanics in Fortnite could make this type of game even more fun. Now that zombies (or whatever you want to call them) have been added to Battle Royale, it would be awesome for this game mode to happen!

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously there are many ways to go about this, but the way I imagine it is a dark and foggy map, similar to Fortnitemares, where you and your squad drop in with no other players and have the entire map to yourselves. You could loot like you normally do, while you fight off waves of zombies which become harder and harder. You could build enormous forts to protect yourself from them. I think this would be so much fun and would get a lot of players to play the game instead of CoD Zombies. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know what you think. Thank you Epic!",FortNiteBR

I do like some aspects of redeploy (who doesn't love jumping off mountains?), but overall, it's making healing up after a fight a challenge.  I don't think I've had a fight in the last 2 weeks that wasn't pushed by another team after it was over.   To account for this, healing items need to be sped up across the board.  Not shields, just healing items.  I think knocking a few seconds off medkits and chug-jugs would have a net positive on the game in it's current state.",FortNiteBR

The only problem is, what we have now has lots of plot holes. To explain it easily, a sentient AI Robot, A.I.M, escaped some sort of frozen state (hence the icy arms and legs), flew a plane over the Fortnite island, and dropped down with a parachute to flush factory. My idea is he’s stealthily trying to reach something, hence the reason why he dropped to the edge of the island. What is his purpose? Who created him and where did he come from? And probably most importantly, is the cube still out there, as well as, possibly, the rocket? It never really exploded so it could still be traveling through time. And as for the cube, the droplets of power dropped through the portal are still out there. Could the cube have transferred it’s power to something else, knowing its current body would blow up?

1. Fortifying your ramps so that you can’t get shot down. Essentially under builds are useless now.
2. Learning to escape fights by using jumpads etc was a huge part of the game. 
3. Build fights being risky based on the fact that you can get third party shot down. Now all you have to do is jump off the builds and you’re good to go.
4. The pace of the game has changed totally!

I think epic should reconsider the glider change and revert back to the way it was in all previous seasons. Huge changes to gameplay is what destroys a game. Coming from h1z1 a game that is pretty much gone because of changes to the core mechanics, I would say to epic tread carefully.

The only pro I can see is that fall damage has been reduced significantly.

HOWEVER, once Epic started retroactively adding styles to past skins, they made so much more work for themselves and opened the door for many requests/complaints.  Now, everyone thinks every skin ever released needs to have (a) style(s) and posts a millions times about it on this sub/social media daily.  The ""suggestions"" are never ending.  Hell, even if a style is added to a past skin, there's a ton of ""They should have added \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ style"".  Epic SHOULD (hindsight 20/20) have only added styles to new skins and not cater to the children complaining that their old skin doesn't have (a) style(s).  Products evolve and get better.  If you bought a tv a year ago and a new tv came out today with more features for the same price, do you expect the tv company to upgrade your tv for free?  No, do you see how ridiculous that sounds?  For the love of god, stop with the styles requests and be happy with what YOU BOUGHT.

I eventually got over it and carried on playing until my bad aim started to become normal again but it was when I was messing around in playground and my friend suggested seeing what it was like playing without aim assist that I discovered my aim assist was 'Off'

The bombshell hit and I realised that my aim assist has been off for the last 3 weeks or so.

I've since turned it back on and literally every game I do well in my accuracy is always above 60% and I feel like an absolute don in every exchange I'm in.

My tip is to try going for a week or so with aim assist off then switch it back on. Get used to gunfights without aim assist. ",FortNiteBR

(and I mean try to go on Solo vs Squad or Team Terror LTM and pull a sick escape from 4 player, that feels really great). But I play almost exclusively Solo and 8 out of 10 games when arriving in top 10 and trying to rush someone that has the high ground and investing 500 to 800 materials just to see your “opponent” glide away and just after that being rushed by another player who has full mats is really not worth it (nor fun in my opinion). So I thought that maybe Epic should either get rid of the glider thingy or just make wood/stone/metal easier to farm, for exemple instead of giving between 45 and 60 wood for a big tree they could give between 55 and 70 (or something like that) so that when this situation happens you either have some materials left or you can quickly farm to get a little mats to fight the next player. So yeah tell me if that situation happens for you too and if this solution seems reasonable, thanks guys.

I still remember struggling trying to reach for a chest on the top floor of the old loot lake factories, I spent more time than I’m willing to admit figuring out how and where to build a ramp to get to it (I thought I had to parkour my way up). Anyway, being the competitive person that I am, I had to get good at the game, I HAD to. Never before had I played a Battle Royale game, in fact, I’d never played a shooter on PC. As if learning to aim and shoot wasn’t hard enough, I had to learn how to build as well. Luckily for me the building meta at the time wasn’t as developed as it is now a days and a ramp wall rush was as complicated as it got. 

Long story short I got good, I got very good. The learning curve was rough (my k.d. and win ratio will easily prove that) but in time I broke into the top 10 players with the most wins in my country. I got so good that I became entitled, and this is where it all went south. It wasn’t that I COULD and WOULD win pretty often, no, I HAD to win. And as you know things don’t always go your way in this game and even the best players in the world have a bad game here and there. Now, winning back in season 3 or 4 wasn’t so much of an accomplishment when you were way above the skill of an average player. But the average player got better, they got a lot better. 

This entitlement that I mentioned before is the reason why I’m writing this today. This along with a competitive and explosive personality drove me to get angry every time I messed up, I got outplayed or when luck was simply not on my side. This of course would result in me doing worse and worse after every game and by the end of the day I’d be screaming at my computer screen to the point where people would come into my room and ask if everything was okay. Yelling became throwing and before I knew it I was punching anything that was around. Now my knuckles are purple and swollen and I’ve spent more money on replacing peripherals than I have on in-game purchases. 

There’s a fine line between passion and addiction. I never saw myself as addicted since I never had that urge to play all the time, now I realize the word’s true meaning. When something’s hurting you it’s time to stop, regardless of how much you love doing it. 

As hard as that last paragraph was to write it was necessary, I’m writing this not only as a confession to myself, but also as a reminder; it’s time to move on and focus on my last semester of college, the company that I’ve been trying to get going (ironically eSports related), my health, and most importantly the relationship I just started with the girl of my dreams. 

I felt the need to share this to hopefully get through to some of you guys that might be in the same place as me. Don’t let something you love overtake you wether it’s Fortnite or something different, enjoy it for what it is, be competitive, have fun and most importantly just build lol.

TL;DR: Loved the game, sucked at the game, got good, got angry when I lost, angry isn’t good for me, leaving for my health, sad for having to leave.",FortNiteBR

With the amount of other good items in the game now, and the relatively decreased damage the pump now does, I think that the double pump would be in a very good place.

Some reasons I think it should come back

1. Taking up 2 inventory slots for shotguns limits your space for other items like meds, mobility, or splodes.
2. Fight rarely come down to a full on build battle these days, and if they do, the winner is usually who found the double barrel or RPG first. (If it’s two players of similar skill.)
3. In my opinion it was one of the most fun mechanics ever, and bringing it back may help create some new interest in people who are unhappy with the state of the game

Don’t get me wrong, double pump would still be very very good, but it definitely wouldn’t be op like it used to. At least we could have a chance against someone with good RNG

If you disagree, let me know your reasons why.",FortNiteBR

Ever since Epic released Fortnitemares two weeks ago on the Switch it hasn't been optimized that well for the console. Player opponents movements are jagged, delayed, and sometimes appear frozen (still happening today). 

But that's not what I'm going to write about tonight. 

Despite the Switch version's flaws, there's one thing that has stood out the most to me during the event until now. A seizure-inducing bug from the Deadfire set. Yes, I'm talking about the *entire* set, from the skin to the paraglider. Everything!

Here me out, by using every piece of the set or just one of them and then entering the game, there would be a slight chance of a bug occurring for whatever reason. It's been random at times but once it occurs, the flashing stays until you reset your console (or close the software). Sometimes it flashes once every 3 three seconds at a slow rate and the other time it constantly flashes quicker than a second. Usually, you'd think it would go away when you stand still. Ehh... kinda I guess? However, if you move the camera a bit to the left or right that's when it continues. The effect still stays even after you changed all your gear to something else. I don't have any video proof since Fortnite disabled the clip feature. However, I've posted a link to pictures showcasing what I was dealing with during the Fortnitemares event a couple days ago.

But you’re happy with it for the wrong reasons. Im an active member of this sub and one of the main reasons I see people liking this implementation is the standard “now im not afraid to fall of my build/get shot down off my build/take fall damage” and thats fine. 
But you should realize this is not the reason Epic introduced redeploy. It wasn’t to make build fights or escaping easier for anyone.

Now we can discuss those reasons most players give is another skillgap closer but thats not what I care about.

The only reason I could see Epic adding this feature is for the problem we’ve been having since a lot of rifts have disappeared, the spread of people across the map and the small number of players that are left after the closing of the first circle. I think Epic thought, people would not be afraid to die to the storm anymore choosing remote locations again and helping to give more action mid game.

At first I thought, sure there are a lot of downsides, but if this is what they want to fix and it works its fine.

But it hasn’t. In the beginning of season 6 the biggest 2 problems were third parties and low number of people in the second circle. Its only become worse now. Ive had games where there were less than 15 people alive after the first circle close, and 3rd partying has become worse than ever.
People are still not landing enough in remote locations, and if they are it all gets evened out because every player just glides to everywhere theres any fight going on or any big builds on the map. Which means the winner of the fight gets killed anyway by a 3rd 4th or 5th party, making the number of people alive even smaller. Which also explains why turtling is getting much more common. People fight, 2 seconds later theres already someone gliding on top of them while they are healing. They will either try to redeploy away or turtle until the next 3rd party arives.

I don’t care about the worse players getting a little advantage because they dont have to make steady builds to not get shot down, or falling of their builds and not taking fall damage. The things you tried to solve with this have gotten even worse for the fortnite gameplay.

You can say “weve received positive feedback” but this aint it chief.


So fellow fortnite players, think about this, it doesn’t matter if you like the redeploy for particular reasons, it matters that this was implemented to improve other reasons which have all gotten worse with this update. If you like the redeploy or not the reason it was really put in the game has failed.

Would like to hear your thoughts on this, if youre a pro redeploy or anti, it doesn’t matter. But dont give the argument it has to stay because you like no fall damage because thats not why they brought it in.

In fortnite it was already very good to 3rd party players during fights and created very frustrating gameplay for some people to get into fights because everytime you seem to build fight someone you either get shot at by someone else or get shot down by someone else at least 50% of the time. The way it works now, is players can 3rd party you while you fight, then if you win your fight and try to heal up, they can just instantly dive bomb onto your head when you're low. I do agree with the good things glider redeploy has like getting away from fights etc. If you pick a bad fight however, you should get punished and be FORCED to use your launch pad to get away or waste something that you have so you lose the fight overall to live. Blue pads were a great solution to this issue because they were fairly common and could also prevent fall damage. However they didn't allow you to instantly deploy from 100 meters away onto someones head. This change also completely lowers the skill cap on building. The only time I see players in my lobby reinforce their builds is in scrim games now and even then it's less common. Nobody has a fear of fall damage so every just spam builds single stair cases and doesn't care if they get shot down. You can't punish people for building poorly anymore. I think blue pads should be added back to the game and the redeploy should be taken out, or at least removed until they find some sort of way to make it less dominant. This single change has ruined a lot of the fun in the game for me as well as many other players.",FortNiteBR

Disco Mode was amazing, it was like a Playgrounds with conquering included, some people enjoyed it as a Deathmatch game, others enjoyed it as a good chance to train without fear of return to lobby, and others just enjoyed dancing in the scenario! Though the mode wasn't perfect (we should respawn in land for avoid stalking from the back, and get mats from killing people like the ammo, and maybe, even weapons), it was very fun for me, I was playing this mode all time.

...And 50vs50 was also amazing! I still remember a match which my brother, me and a some persons in our team were protecting the last enemy, we was like 39 still alive and like seven of us was protecting and dancing with the last enemy, it was an unique and funny experience, also it eases many quests.

The point is, why don't keep these modes permanent? Now we have a ""50 - 24"" game mode with zombies where you don't know who's shooting you for focus on zombies, because it has A LOT of zombies stalking you and almost was better as a mode with respawn enabled, the other modes.. just... no, I don't enjoy them, got tired of them, I don't want play as a pro player, I just want enjoy the game!

I hope that both modes comes back soon so I get motivated again and continue playing in PvP!",FortNiteBR

Here’s a few... There is no penalty to losing a build fight as you can just fly away, there is no need to learn how to descend down mountains or build fights using building techniques as you can just jump off, fights last forever as cowardly players will run (or glide) indefinitely to avoid fighting if you even attempt to engage with them, third partying has never been easier, jump pads are irrelevant, advanced ramp rushing is less useful as you can just single ramp towards an enemy as being shot down will result in no fall damage, strategically moving to the next circle no longer exists as you can glide over easily, the list goes on... and on. I’m sure most decent players agree as I know we are wanting this mechanic removed. The game is being dumbed down significantly. Fortnite is a good game that we enjoy, yet lately it doesn’t feel like Fortnite anymore. Skill is not being rewarded and cheap cowardice is being granted success. So my suggestion is simple, remove glider redeploy, and make Fortnite the great game that is once was, reward those of us who have put in the time. Thanks for reading.",FortNiteBR

2.  Volume 11 gear ( power chord ...etc ) : release date it 9th of sep (9/9) 

3.  Skull Trooper : Release date is 10th Oct ( 10/10 ) 

&amp;#x200B;

and those are the OG skins that got released so far and if you look on the release dates you will notice that the Day matches the number of the month ( DD/MM/YY ) which is pretty interesting and brings us to say that on 11/11 Theres a very high chance of an OG skin coming back and it could be the ghoul trooper but something that supports my pattern more is on 12/12 ... the christmas skins will come back .

1- It makes you build like shit, you constantly see people with literally 1 ramp and maybe some kind of protection around it. They take it to the sky, without any drawbacks for them but with all the drawbacks for you, since highground is always more advantageous.

2- It make's all your effort for killing someone go to NOTHING since they can just glide away, and you might say well just shoot him in the air, which is true in some situation, must of the time isn't do. because of other players shooting at you and you not having always sight on them.

Players have been getting better and epic has been trying to reduce the skill gap which means you are going to be losing more health in fights. This one slot would gives an incentive for players to carry atleast one heal so if you kill a player and he does hit you a fair bit. You will most likely get some healing from him to replenish your stock or health. This will also allow you to carry more gund thus allowing you to play a fight in more ways thus adding variety,FortNiteBR

Some like it, some loathe it. I myself can’t stand it and find it to be the single worst addition to the default playlist - It belongs in LTMs. Epic claims they want players to have a non-RNG mobility mechanic, while I disagree with a need, I have an idea.

Remove Glider Redeploy and add in Gadgets. If you are unfamiliar with StW Gadgets are selectable skills, Airstrike, Heal, Teleporter, Hover Turret, etc. Now, I’m not saying to add those in, but to take the idea of selectable skills and have them on a cooldown, in the pre-game lobby you choose what Gadget you want to have. In StW you can have 2, but Epic can limit this to one if they choose so.

Imagine no Glider Redeploy, but you get to choose from the following:

Impulse Grenades - Can only be used once every 20 seconds.

Shockwave Grenades - Can only be used once every 35 seconds.

Chiller - Can only be used once every 15 seconds.

Launch Pad - Can only be used once every 120 seconds.

Rift-to-Go - Can only be used once every 150 seconds.

Grappler - Can only be used once every 20 seconds.

Combat Glider - Can be activated while 2+ tiles above the ground to deploy your glider. Can only be used once every 90 seconds.

All of the above are removed from floor loot and chests. 

This removes the RNG from mobility, while adding in customization.",FortNiteBR

Especially in solos, where it can seem like a never ending stream of players flying in to fights. This can definitely be a good thing and a bad thing. I like the aggressive nature of it and the game being quicker/ more fast paced, but it's certainly frustrating when a never ending stream of players are gliding in on your fight and you have no time to recover. If this is something that is going to stick around, I think heal times need to be shortened drastically. In blackout, where wingsuit redeploy has been a part of the game since day one, you can heal very quickly and while on the move. In fortnite, hitting a medkit and say mini shields requires 15 seconds and you have to be sitting still. This is not practical whatsoever to the new playstyle. 

I propose that if glider redeploy does indeed stick around for the Long haul (really hoping it doesn't) then the healing system needs to be revamped or at least shortened. The glider redeploy promotes more aggressive play but in reality it rewards the least aggressive player who didn't fly in on the fight or flew in at the very end fired one shot and gets to loot 5 people. 

Maybe I'm wrong here, I know that this will in turn effect all fights but something feels wrong about the current playstyle. Ready for all downvotes and comments telling me to get good. ",FortNiteBR

Here are my suggestions:

**A Glide Limit**
Similar to the build limit, but for opposite for gliders. You can only redeploy your glider below a certain, let’s say, the height of 5-6 builds (just as an example). Maybe the limit is a height at which you can’t use your glider below it.

**A Glider Recharge**
Players can only use their glider once ever ___ seconds, such as 30 seconds. More strategic uses of the glider would have to be implemented. It’s almost like a launch pad in your pocket that recharges.

**Minimized Diving**
There should be a penalty for using your glider, which means vulnerability. Less diving time allowed, and more gliding. This gives players the chance to run away but more of a chance to be shot down.",FortNiteBR

Right, apparently I have to spell it out for you, I'm surprised I'm the first to post about this, but yeah here we go.

Everyone knows about time travel, heck, we even got excited for it during season 6, but this time it actually is the case.

When Kevin (R.I.P) exploded we were taken to a space beyond time, where we could view multiple world lines, (John Titor look it up) a countless number of them, this theory is reinforced by the Rift Butterfly, ie. the butterfly effect, which is to do with time travel. This butterfly represented our shift in the world line, sending Loot Lake back in time, this is why it is unrecognizable. This is further reinforced by the runes around the map, they are going back to how they were.

Now I am aware you have some questions, ""Why is Kevin still there if we're in the past?"" simple, we went back in time so why not what was left of Kevin too.

And yes I know this doesn't strictly work as Titor has said, that does not mean Epic are not putting their own spin on it.",FortNiteBR

Had a really rough session today and I really am hoping more people are noticing some of the glaring issues that I have been on this patch. 

Disclaimer, I know this subreddit has been extremely positive about playgrounds mode coming out but performance issues and general balancing on this patch have reached in my opinion a new low.  

-Firstly, in game audio has taken a massive leap backwards. I no longer can accurately figure out where most players are and there feels like there is no longer a sweet spot when it comes to where players can and can't be. This isn't just with vertical audio this also includes when building structures.  Previous patches felt like I had a pretty good handle on player location, now it just feels like Epic has intentionally made it more difficult to pinpoint where people are around me at all times. I don't know why we are expanding the amount of distance a player can hear around them all it is doing is making movement discouraged and making tracking muddled. I sincerely have no idea why we are tweaking sound, what are we trying to fix here?

-Choppiness, frame choppiness and general stuttering are increased since 4.5 went live. Constantly I feel like I am fighting the game to line up my shots and move around the map. More than ever before on any patch.  

-General warping and in game lag is higher now in the past 48 hours. I have watched players phase around reminiscent to old standby freezes that used to happen on the OG Xbox. I've never seen so much of this early game and it is super noticeable now more than ever before.  

-People are still getting under the map in Tilted Towers, in fact parts of the entire island are literally exploitable where you can shoot someone and they cannot shoot you back. How does this pass QA? 

-Ghost shots are gone but have been replaced by the ""your gun won't fire"" bug with shotguns. To my knowledge this only happens with pumps but I could be wrong. Essentially when switching back and forth between weapons back to a shotgun you literally can just fire even though your gun makes the weapon delay sound.

-C4. Being able to pressure structures is completely cool as I agree that late game fornite is an absolutely snooze fest at the highest level but why on earth is C4 still this way? The ease of execution on C4 right now is not even close to balanced. This should come in stacks of 1-2 in it's current state. It's far too powerful at blue rarity.  

-Clingers still are detonating as a wall disappears making survival impossible in some situations. If someone clingers while a wall is being shot there is no counterplay, you lost already. This is purely my opinion but this game is at it's best when you can always fight back. I am ok with clingers being the anti-box but it seems a little heavy handed right now. 
 
-Peaking over structures now randomly causes my aim to reposition somewhere completely different. I've also had instances of just randomly warping to the top of my ramps in the middle of fights.   

From general game stability to balance I have no idea how reddit has been so quiet on this one. Maybe I am losing my mind but I definitely haven't been annoyed with a patch since the great weapon delay introduction. General gameplay is buggy and laggy with audio feeling like it is regressing. The actual meta ingame has made it so if you run into somebody with a lot of splodes you have zero hope of outplaying it with building. To be clear I am not saying that splodes should not defeat buildings but there needs to be a risk of failure from a bad throw.  

TL:DR-  
It does not matter if we are talking gameplay, in game audio or general connectivity stability this patch has been a monumental turd. The only changes I liked here were the ""weapons visible on the water change"". Everything else has left me wondering ""why?""",FortNiteBR

With this in mind, how in the world does Epic keep it in the game? If they weren't planning on hotfixing it why not just remove it till they can balance it? 1 C4 is able to completely reset a building fight, and if 2 people are in a build fight 1 person can come in and blow up the entire thing killing 2 from just 1 C4 (which has happened to me) and its no skill.

At this point many are livid. Many were anxious and still had hope the mode would come as promised, but instead Epic let us down again. 

Come Friday Epic gave yet another half ass update. Basically, it was an update telling us to stay tuned for another update “shortly.”

It’s been hours since, and I don’t know how long “shortly” is to Epic Games, but at this point I don’t even have the desire to play the game that I love.

*You have not played a single round with said skin

*The refund is made within 24 hours after the purchase

* You have NOT checked out/inspected the item in your inventory

*You can only refund an item ONCE a day.

I know I know we never had refunds before and now that they've implemented them we shouldn't be asking for more but I believe this is a good way to improve the system. If there's any loopholes to this idea, please let me know.

**Reason Two:** The *#6 loading screen* shows all the characters on a movie set with the description as ""What a crazy shoot! Those meteors that crashed down sure gave us a lot of free production value! Glad we survived it!"" This means that when the meteor landed, a movie team was filming (also seen in the *#1 loading screen*) and they took the destruction from the meteors for their film set. **This means that omega isn't actually a villain, just an actor, and that his rocket isn't real, its a movie prop.**

The Visitor (Blockbuster skin) is the only actual Superhero/Villain as he came inside the meteor, so if he launches the rocket, it should technically do nothing. Unless this movie company has a very large budget and actually made a working, space suitable rocket.

But still who knows, it might launch but not be made for a proper launch and then come crashing down.",FortNiteBR

The reasoning behind my thoughts of this is that these 2 have been the most requested places for changes yet they've received none at all where as the theorized destruction area, Moisty Mire, has been given an overhaul and has been appreciated. There seems to be no reason to give out such an overhaul that makes it a viable drop spot only to destroy it and leave the other 2 empty places hanging around with scrap to nothing. The bunker in Wailing Woods could be some of the foreshadowing we were given in Season 3 as we learned Epic does hint very much and small easter eggs have great meaning. There is also the thrusters of the rocket that appeared in Anarchy Acres when you went to the time of the starting island in Playground in replay, this hints the Rocket might be going towards that general direction, why else would it be there. For Risky Reels some people may remember the leaked picture of Risky Reels in destruction and thought of it as one of the loading screens, when it got buried under more leaks, people dismissed it as unimportant, it may be now. The circle of impact may involve Wailing, Tomato, and Risky, and this does make sense as well.
2. **The Leviathan Theory/Destruction of Moisty Mire**, if you haven't heard of this theory, I don't know what rock you've been living under. In short, using the leaks and secrets of audio files, people have deduced a Leviathan/Moisty Merman will emerge from Moisty Mire, and plow through causing destruction. You can look up the theory and evidence for more detail, but the rocket doesn't seem to quite mesh with this theory. Some think the rocket will be targeted for the Leviathan, the evidence for it is a bit far-fetched in my eyes though.

I started to understand that Epic Games cannot give us great updates or an estimate of when they can release Playground.

But now, i'm starting to think this game is gonna die out really quick. 

First of all, they nerfed shotguns. That was the first major thing they did that had huge community feedback.

Next, they lowered mat spawns and we lost mats from 500 to 200 in llamas. That was another sign, although in the same update.

Now, we hear that they're going to lower the mat cap.

And finally, they decide to spend 3 hours rebooting 50v50 instead of Playground, completely stopping the train of hard work, and holding back the release by possibly 3 hours. Not that much time, but bad move. Look at the comments on the 50v50 tweet! We're in an uproar.

Epic Games makes Fortnite a game where the community decides. They listen to us. The fanbase is everything in a game. But this game will die soon, because instead of listening to the community, they've gone into that emo phase. They don't listen to us anymore. 

We're not game developers in the least. But if we get what we want, then the game will not die. If we don't like what we get, it will. Epic Games, in the latest updates all i've seen is you saying you added this or that because it'll help the game go on the path you want. That's against the fanbase entirely.

I love you guys as developers, yet, i'm starting to lose a bunch of respect. I was always saying good things about you on the Twitter and Reddit posts about Playground. But now, i'm starting to see that this game is going on a fast slide downwards. They're even starting lawsuits in a selfish outrage. They're suing employees for giving us leaks, yet, that's what we want. You can ruin a life by that, but it certainly did not ruin any of yours.

(Please note. I'm not mad. I may not be right. Just from what I see, players are having a tough time being entirely happy with the progress of the game. You built a community of players that ask, and you usually give, but when you don't give, they start to herd away. The game won't die as fast if you guys just listen to us.)

If a dev reads this, please go into detail why i'm wrong. I'm not attacking Epic Games or you guys. I'm sure Epic knows what they're doing, so don't say that as a point. if you want to disagree, tell me why the game isn't dying. Tell me the community did not get mad at the shotgun nerf, or mat nerfs. Tell me the entire failure of the Playground LTM, one of, if not the most amazing decision you guys have made, and the addition that made the community the happiest it's ever been for Fortnite, did not cause people to turn on you... we respect you.

I'm curious if anyone else here is seeing/feeling the impact of linking a very nice end of season cosmetic to a level requirement that is quite hard to achieve:

I'm noticing that there are a lot more people looking for group/squads without any K/D requirements (which I feel is good for the game).  

I am also noticing though that there are more and more people focusing on hiding/camping to guarantee a higher placement rather than building/fighting.  This is seen through the amount of people in the first/second circle.  I'm also seeing a huge spike in the number of people remaining in the final circle.

Overall I feel this has definitely slowed down the pace of the game - maybe this is how Battle Royale type game is meant to be played but it definitely feels different than the Fortnite before.

In fact, I much prefer it to 50v50 for several reasons. The main, overarching reason is that I play these large team battle modes to increase the amount of fights I can get into, which is why I prefer this mode and the old, one bus version of 5x20 to all other recent team battle modes Epic has released.

50v50's problem is that most matches are incredibly one sided with not much action going on overall. There's two buses going in opposite directions, usually meaning that one team can reach locations (or even reach the circle) long before the opponent can because they're on their side, which encourages everyone to just land on their own side and prevents early game fights. Once the teams finally meet and the fighting begins, the first team to get a significant lead almost unfailingly snowballs out of control. If it's your team that snowballs, you will spend 5+ minutes looking for the last few players who are hiding in a large circle. I ended up quitting about half my 50v50 matches because my team would gain a significant player count advantage and then I couldn't find anybody to fight anymore.

Now, Final Fight 8x12 is a man's mode. There's one bus, so if you land at a location that is early on in the buses path, many members from every team might land there for huge early game fights. However, getting a couple kills early on doesn't mean that your team has a huge advantage like it does in 50v50, the number of teams guarantees that you have to keep fighting all game to win. If you're talented, you can carry your team and end up with 20+ kills. I understand and agree with the complaints about storm progression in this mode, but despite having to spend a lot of time running from the storm, I'm still finding more consistent action in every match of this mode in comparison to 50v50. 

TL;DR: 50v50 has very little early game action as a result of two separate buses, leading to teams just landing on their own side, looting, and pushing to circle. 50v50 is too easy because getting a few kills turns the match into a one-sided stomp where you roam around looking for the last few hiding players. In 8x12, having only one bus leads to huge early game fights and getting a few kills doesn't instantly lead to your team having a massive advantage. This mode certainly does have problems, especially with storm progression, but the amount of action present in this mode is much higher than 50v50's.",FortNiteBR

I'm someone who likes to play video games competitively and enjoys watching people compete at the highest level. Just for perspective, I have 1900+ wins with over 40,000 eliminations. I just have some opinions I wanted to share and see some opinions against mine.

The Good: 
-SMGs (tac and silenced) are now viable for end game loadouts. With this recent buff SMGs are a great option to partner a heavy/pump shotgun. Since the shotguns can not longer one-shot newly built structures, SMGs have found a solid identity as a wall breaker that also has a fast ttk. People have been running this instead of double pump which is a good thing and I think Epic should keep it exactly how it is now.

The Bad:
-Explosives are even more obnoxious to go against. C4s were already annoying to combat and rockets are just as bad. You can either hold 8 or 10 C4s and destroy structures easily while doing damage to the opponent if you stack more than 1 on top of them. I understand that Epic is trying to get rid of the boxing ""turtling"" tactic but it also hinders pushing since you can break the base of their ramp in one blow. It will promote a more passive playstyle where people are at a standstill 3rd person peeking. Epic also announced that they are using at least 100mil on competitive Fortnite tournaments and this buff to explosives will make it very boring to watch. You can barely manage to counter it with building at the expense of material but material is also your lifeline. Once, you are out of mats you are defenseless. This explosive update will also be indirectly buffed more if they decrease the mat count which has been speculated to happen with their post about play styles on June 21st. I think this wasn't a necessary change that they needed to make.

The Questionable:
-Shotguns do less damage to structures. It's good because it makes SMGs a more viable option but it's bad because the pump was affected by 50% less structure damage vs the tac/heavy 25% decrease. The pump is a common weapon to walk out of a town or even a house with but the heavy is rarer to obtain. The heavy beats the pump in swap time, headshot damage, and now structure damage. Someone with double heavy outclasses a double pumper or pump/smg combo but it's up to your RNG and that's bad for competitive play. You want to limit RNG as much as you can. I understand that a heavy is a better weapon to hold over the pump which is why it's less common. I think heavy shotguns should be floor loot but at a less percentage than pumps. It will increase the chance to get it since there are more floor loot spawns than actual chest spawns while staying less common than the pump. 

TL:DR 
-SMGs are better now and have a solid identity in the meta
-Explosives are too strong
-The shotgun structure damage nerf could be tweaked by increasing heavy spawns as floor loot

Kill Count: the game where you can still win after you die.

Every player you kill counts as 1 kill. HOWEVER, when you kill a player, you also inherit all of their kills. 

For example: player A has 0 kills and player B has 4. A kills B, now A has 5 kills. B will retain their 4 kills if they stay in the match.

At the end of the match the player with the most accumulated kills wins, regardless of who is last alive.

This accomplishes two things. First, it discourages camping, because more kills = higher chance to win. Second, it encourages players to stay in the game and spectate until the end. This is because at any given time in the match players can only see their own kill count, so they have no idea who is in the lead and by how much. It isn’t until one player remains that all kill counts are revealed and the winner announced. Therefore, you could potentially die and place #9, but still wind up with more kills than the player who places #1, and therefore win the match. However, if you leave the match before one player remains, you are disqualified and the player with the next highest kill count (who hasn’t left the match) is the winner.

No respawn as usual, and everything else (storm, materials, etc.) remains the same.

Basically the only thing I build in a game is stairs up a mountain or up to a chest, I almost never destroy trees and will just use the materials I get from a chest. I absolutely detest people that start building as soon as you shoot them, it’s not even a last resort type of thing, they just immediately start building a tower. I know this sounds pretty stupid but I refuse to sink to their level, I’ve basically vowed to never abuse the building feature in the game. People always say to get better and get wins you have to get wins but like I’ve said I’ve gotten 5 solo wins without ever having to build to get a kill, it makes each kill/win more rewarding and it doesn’t feel like you’re getting cheap kills by abusing features. When I occasionally spectate/ watch people play every fight ends up being a competition to see who can build the most stairs above the other person to get a cheap shotgun kill. Apologies for the long post but I just thought I’d let you guys know why I said I was “morally against” building even though I know this post will be downvotes to hell
TL:DR if you abuse the building mechanic in the game I don’t like you or you’re playstyle and hope you don’t win",FortNiteBR

In my opinion this isn't needed, I have to do stuff 6.5 hours per day 5 days a week and I still made it, The level 80 *IN MY OPINION* should not be given to everyone, it should show skill and dedication. Not someone who plays on &amp; off and is butthurt they can't get everything, we all asked for challenges that actually show skill and you can feel proud of. Now that we have it everyone complains, I feel quite bad for epic. Yes I understand solo only players may have a hard time but there is the LFG, Discord etc. that you can go to, even without a mic. I also understand some people may not believe it shows skill, which is fair and shouldn't be just trampled on by me, but I *personally* believe it does, simply because you get way more xp for wins and placements. Please please *please* only comment on this post if you want a conversation and not just a fight, as I will not reply. I want to see other POV on this element of gameplay.

“This is my last game.” I said at 4:30am, after multiple “last games” you were worth it. 

I wanted to make this game count, so naturally, I had no real plan jumping out of the battle bus. I found myself free falling around Loot Lake, I am landing later than I should so I go for the first chest I see on a small island in Loot Lake. That’s where I met you. 

We both landed right by the chest and it was opened. You picked up a burst assault and gave me that look. Oh that look....
But instead of gunning me down, you began to dance, so I did the same. You knew I was vulnerable, and like a phat assed angel, you dropped the burst for me to pickup. You did not have any other guns or weapons and thus put your fate in my hands. 

You did not speak, but you never needed to. We communicated through emotes as we set off together. You followed me and I followed you. I thought I was going to lose you when we reached the house in the middle of Loot Lake, but you one shotted the enemy with a hand cannon that I found under the house. We then set off to the nearest shopping cart. You pushed, and I rode along. 

We made our way through the map, decimating our foes until Pleasant. That’s where I lost you. We were chasing a bogey up a small hill when I heard the shot. When I turned around it was too late, you were gone. I attempted to seek revenge for your death but to no avail. We made it to the top 20 together. Though our time together was short, I will never forget it. If you are out there, and you see this, comment or DM me so we may pick back up where we left off. I will wait for you. 


Sincerely, 
Brogittarius

In fact the ping is so bad so regularly that NASA scientists confirmed its a better time keeping device than a pulsar.

Quick peeking around corners, usually with a shotgun, can be annoying if the person playing has a decent 30-100 ping. You can see them walk out, shoot, and walk back around a corner or wall. However when they have 200-300 ping and make quick peeks around corners people just rubberband around corners or even appear within a few frames, shoot, then disappear in thin air. Sometimes if you shoot at them they won’t even register a hit.

All the talk about having ‘professional’ teams or tournaments is a joke when you’ve still got blatant exploits like this. Fix the servers, quick peeking will go away.

TL;DR, Don't listen to people saying it's too late, wait for Season 5, if you buy it now you will profit. Even if you're tier 1, but most of you I'm guessing are much more than that.",FortNiteBR

More importantly the fucking shotguns, for the past 4 weeks they have been doing literally 0 damage. For some reason we were able to switch guns faster than the server can handle, and shoot faster too. This was a ""minor"" issue as most people didnt get it and it happened so little, but i was the exception, i get in a fight, switch to my pump, do 0 damage, run double shotgun and do 0 damage for the first couple shots because of switching too fast, basically any time i pull out a shotgun, and this is still the same, sort of. Ever since yesterdays update that has been fixed, but now instead i just literally cant shoot my shotguns at all, if i switch from pickaxe or any gun to a shotgun i cant shoot it for like 5 whole seconds, and have to switch to another shotgun, it only happens with the pump and heavies. After playing this game since literally day 1 i know how to shoot shotguns, i know how to time the shots, its not an error on my part, something screwy is happening and its costing me 95&amp;#37; of my close fights as i literally cant do any damage.

( Talking About Skins ),"This season has probably been the worst season for skins out of all of the seasons. We can all agree. Now does anyone remember when the shop was weekly items and not featured? I think we all can agree again that season 2 and 1 had the best skins. No, Im not asking for those skins back, I have a lot of those skins. Think about it though Crackshot, Red Knight, Raptor, Ghoul Trooper, Skull Trooper, etc... All of these items were released in season 1 or 2. They were in the shop for 7 days. That meant around every 2 to 3 weeks there would be a new skin in the shop. ( Most of the daily items were repeats or just simple quick reskinned skins ) This means they had plenty of time to work on each individual skin, not having to worry about putting almost 10 skins out every 2 weeks. Ever since season 3 its just seemed like the quality has gone down but the quantity has gone up. Please epic see this and take this into consideration. I rarely buy skins anymore because of the fact that they are just not that good anymore. Because I know if I buy it, it will most likely just sit there and never be used, except for the day that I bought it. We want skins that will leave us sitting there for minutes thinking about which one we want to buy and then use. Im not trying to hate, Im not putting this out there to hate. It just seems like they are shoving skins in our face that are costing 2000 v-bucks but are worth 800.

Edit - Realizing this now that there is actual proof that they are rushing skins, because why now would they be adding the capes to the venturion and the venturia. Also the Battlehound. If werent rushing the skins these capes would have came out the same day that the skins did.",FortNiteBR

However, the weekly updates make this almost impossible. The same thing happens after every update... 

Update drops; we can hardly find a way to win after the first 4 days. After those few days, we get used to all the changes and new bugs which leads to a few 4 - 8 game win streaks. New update comes out, all of a sudden its not fun anymore because we have to completely relearn and a play around a bunch of weird imbalances, bugs, and gameplay adjustments that were completely unwarranted. It makes the game nearly impossible to enjoy for a long period of time.

I'm not saying that Epic should completely stop updating (obviously), but at least open up a seperate test server lobby for people to experience and see all the changes that are planned for the future, and then apply the popular updates at the end of the month so we can all actually enjoy the game for more than 3 days at a time. 

Another reason that these weekly updates are not great for the community is because (believe it or not) there is a large number of players who enjoy this game that have other obligations to commit to. Those players don't have time to constantly adjust to these drastic changes on a weekly basis. It just seems unnecessary.

Edit: I want to address all the people that will comment ""if you don't like it then stop playing the game.""

Siege:
• Two teams of 50 (or 30 if 50 is too unstable/laggy)
• One team attacks while other defends
• Defending team starts with materials in protected circle - attacking team can not enter for a certain period
• During this period, the defending team is able to safely build a large fortress and other structures to protect a flag in the center of the circle
• Attacking team loots during this time (very high drop rate/ammo/mats)
• Supply drops for attackers
• A minute after starting period, attackers are teleported near defending team’s circle
• Infinite respawns with respawn timer (attackers spawn outside defense circle, defenders spawn within defense circle)
• The attackers have 7-10 minutes to capture the flag (by holding Action button on flag for 10-15 seconds)
• After first round, the teams switch between offense and defense
• The team who captures the flag while on offense in a shorter time wins

This type of game mode (WoW - Strand of the Ancients, LoL - Nexus Siege, etc.) has been present in many other games, and I believe fortnite would be the PERFECT game for it.

So far we have 52 emoticons in the game right now and they are hardly used. With there being 13 emoticons in the current Battle Pass, you can be sure we will get around 13 or more emoticons in Battle Pass 4.

Emoticons fill a place in the Battle Pass that could be replaced with a much better item. 

So, I have some suggestions to make this game with tons of potential much better for all us skin junkies out there.

First up we have weapon skins, there are limitless ideas for weapon skins. A few I have in mind are streamers skins and then normal weapon skins. If you look closely at the [M16 Assault Rifle](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fortnite/images/c/c1/Fortnite_M16Blue.png/revision/latest?cb=20180311171123) it has a skull emblem on it.

Just imagine a white and red M16 with the [Nick Eh 30 Logo](https://yt3.ggpht.com/a-/ACSszfGv9fKr2hJ7BEkh1bq9iB4Xhmw4NfsC89mt3Q=s900-mo-c-c0xffffffff-rj-k-no) in place of that skull emblem. I believe that would look beautiful.

Now for normal weapon skins, we’ve already seen weapon skins integrated into Fortnite. In fact there is a weapon skin live in the game right now as of 06/29/18! The grenade launcher, it shoots fire works. In the past we’ve seen the RPG shoot Jack-O-Lanterns and we’ve seen the grenade launcher shoot snowballs. I think we could get some more things like this put into the Battle Pass that we could permanently equip.

Now for my favourite idea, death animations. If you don’t know what I mean by “death animation” I’ll help you understand. Currently in Fortnite there is only 1 death animation, [and here is what it looks like](https://youtu.be/qR6kAQslAXg). The current animation is boring and old. 

I have 2 ideas in mind right now. First idea has to do with Save the World. In Save the World there are zombies or “husks” as they’re called. After you die in Battle Royale husk arms could burst out of the ground grabbing your player model and pulling it into the ground. Your player model could have some crazy expression on their face, maybe something like [this Snorkel Ops](https://i.imgur.com/5wHtlUK.jpg). Afterward a gravestone could pop up and stay there for a couple seconds. This gravestone could show your in-game name and we could have customization like with The Visitor, Carbide, and Omega skins on the gravestone to either show your wins or total kills in the game mode you’re playing.

Next death animation is pretty simple, put a halo above the player model, throw on some angel wings, make them transparent a bit, and have them ascend upward until they eventually fade away.

Last but not least, sprint trails. Unfortunately I couldn’t find a clip of what I am talking about so I will try to clarify what a spring trail is. If you already know or you have a good idea of what I mean by “sprint trail” then you can go ahead and skip this next section.

If you look behind your player when you start to sprint in Fortnite, you can see a little white cloud of smoke that follows behind your character. That is a sprint trail. 

So for customizing spring trails, we could have a huge variety of things. We don’t even have to have a trail, it could be something as simple as making us have glowing footsteps. When you look at the Raven skin in Fortnite, what do you see? I’ll tell you what I see, an unholy necromancer of death and pain. Now do you think that when an unholy necromancer of death and pain runs, he would have a little pathetic white cloud of smoke following behind? Cuz I don’t. I think he would have glowing purple footsteps that put cracks in the ground from each step he takes. Now there could possibly be a risk using these sprint trails. Look at the Dark Voyager skin, we can see this glow stick swimming in Loot Lake all the way from Lonely Lodge. You might be risking being seen from a distance from your glowing footsteps.

This is what I have to say about the emoticons in Fortnite, I hope a lot of you can agree with me and I would like to see some of your ideas and feedback in the comments section. Thank you, Auclyn.",FortNiteBR

Fortnite is announcing a cup next year, I would love to take part in it, but i can't because I can't get better at this 140 ping, they release new skins everyday, they are nerfing things to make it easy for noobs to play, Llama was the most balanced item and it got nerfed, that's not the point here,the point is they are not listening us,the basic demand of Sea Server for better gaming experience, people are putting so much time, money and effort in this game and still can get outplayed because other people switch guns faster than us due to ping issues. Search on twitter Fortnite Sea Servers, you will literally find thousands of tweet everyday regarding this,but nobody addresses it, it's pushing hardcore fortnite fans to the verge of quiting the game they love, give us some hope atleast, 140 ping ain't good dude, it's not the internet, I have the best internet of where I live and lan connection in my ps4, still i get 140 ping, the game is way too slow for us, they gave Brazil their servers so why not us?
Thanks for giving me your time, if you want to help, just make epic hear us, because we also want to purse a professional gaming career, fortnite could be a great start, India lacks streamers because we always get overlooked when it comes to servers, we always get servers when game is about to die, Thanks in advance for your help, i know there are bunch good people out there who would help and there will be criticism, I am open for opinions.

This would make it so that the enemy is somewhat visible if they’re moving, but not so much when they’re standing still, as the enemy’s silhouette would blend in due to the blurring (in some environments). The current state of editing makes it so that the editor is more visible to the non-editor than the non-editor is to the editor, due to wood and brick walls being easy to see through, but this doesn’t apply to fully built metal. As you guys can probably tell, I used to heavily rely on edit peeking. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still very viable, but it sucks to see your favorite technique get a hard nerf. 

TLDR: Make it so that when in editing, the tiles you remove are very blurred. This’ll make it so that enemies are visible only when moving (in most environments).

My goal here is to at least get EPIC to see this (I know it’s a long shot) and to start a conversation. I want as much people to take a second and just put your opinion in the comments, as I’d like to hear as much different ones as possible. I know a lot of people despise edit peeking and it’s unfair, but IMO I think it should still be a strategy that’s possible to use, as it still takes skill to execute. Thanks everyone!",FortNiteBR

Literally the only input for your sensitivity is with a shitty slider. No game I have ever played uses only a slider for sensitivity. It’s common sense that you won’t be able to get a precise value through a slider and that you should be able to type in your sensitivity value like a normal person. You also used to be able to change sensitivity through the config file, which provided a lot of precision, but for some reason you got rid of it. Why? What do you have to gain from that? Plus, you need to add some more fucking digits on to your sens value. For a lot of people, their sens is usually just one digit, such as 0.08. One digit is not enough. The difference between 0.08 and 0.087 is huge and thanks to your awesome slider and digits, it’s impossible to see that our sens is way off. You could easily solve this by just multiplying the sens value by 100. That way instead of being, say 0.08, it would be 8.13. That way we can actually get a precise value. Now I know that your average player base likely doesn’t care about this, but this is a very very easy change that hurts no one. Even the ten year olds who play this game would know how to multiply a value by 10 or allow players to type in their sens value. That is all.",FortNiteBR

""Explosions now damage all structures within range, whether or not they are visible from the explosion center.""

I'm assuming it's an effort to make it easier to counter building, but this change in particular has a negative affect on gameplay.

Yes, explosives SHOULD be good to counter building, but the way it is now is just too much. 

In case anyone didn't know, a rocket that hits the wall of a 1x1 will now destroy the wall it hits, the ramp behind it, and the 2 side walls connected to the wall it hits. A great way to stop someone from boxing themselves in, right? Agreed.

The problem comes when you come across a player who has high ground AND rockets. Normally you could ramp up to them and a lot of times gain high ground to make it an even fight. With the new changes, though, if you ramp/wall towards them, all it takes is 1 rocket to get shot down. There's no good way to rush these people now. 

In addition, in a build fight, a common strategy is to place ramps above and below you, then turn around to attempt high ground. The double ramps gave you time to turn around and get back to the main structure before being shot down. Not anymore, 1 rocket will destroy both the top and bottom ramps

While I believe these changes were made for the right reason, I don't think it was implemented as good as it could be. 

A smart player would see these changes, and where they would have rushed someone before, they won't anymore because it's too risky with the new explosives. Ramping up to someone or engaging in a build fight against someone with rockets now carries about as much risk as building a bridge 1 wide across mountains over the river east of tilted. You're just asking to get shot down to your death

TL;DR - rockets are OP now, and promotes more passive gameplay because it counters rushing too well",FortNiteBR

I think we need to replace emoticons with something better. Not very many players use the emoticons and they just take up room that we can use for better items in the game. We can remove emoticons from future battle passes and added different items like weapon skins, death animations, and run trails. For weapon skins we could literally get anything, we could have streamer skins or Fortnite skin weapon skins, imagine having a Pump Shotgun skin that has the same colour scheme as the Omega skin or having a Nick Eh 30 skin where the gun is all white and blue and has a little “30” on the side of it. I think that would look amazing! For death animations we could have arms from the husks in Save The World pull us down into the ground and have a grave stone pop up for a couple seconds that says our gamertag and maybe the kills we had in that match or our total wins, or we could float up with a Halo above our head and angle wings on our back. The current run trail in the game is white smoke floating behind your character on the ground, if we could get some customization for that it would be really nice. We could have different colours rather then just white, we could also get a run trail that puts our footprints glowing on the ground with a purple black colour, I’m sure that would look amazing with the Raven skin, Fate skin, Omega (Purple) skin, and the Sub Commander skin. Now of course you could be at a disadvantage using some run trails because your enemies might be able to see you better from a distance. I think that would be okay considering with the Dark Voyager skin, players can see you extremely well across the map. ",FortNiteBR

The KBM playerbase is huge (don't know the percentage but I'm sure every death of mine is because of a KBM). Epic, I'm sure you know the advantages of using a KBM but just to remind you, they are:

2x Building Speed

Godly aim

And..... Hotkeys

This is more than enough to prove that it is unfair for controller players. You know there is an advantage but you choose to not do anything about it.

Matching them with PC players or other KBM players would make a big chunk of the playerbase happy including myself and the thousands of people that upvoted the post about this topic.",FortNiteBR

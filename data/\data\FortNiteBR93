But as off recently I have been hearing people saying things like ""Onesie is my new Main"" as if Fortnite Turned into a MOBA or Hero Shooter. The same a Overwatch Player would Say ""I'm a Reinhardt Main"". Some people I've met actually explain that there is a competitive advantage with certain skins. Which has be mind blown.

This makes no sense, one of the good things about the pop up cups was that you could have a chance of playing with people of your skill level (yes, it was still not perfect for lower levels, but it was something).  
If this is not an error and instead is the direction Epic wants to push Fortnite, then the message is pretty clear:  
Epic does not care about casual player experience, or, to put it better, thinks that the casual player is content with stupid items added to the game, LTMs and challenge grinding, hence we won't ever have any form of Skill Based Matchmaking that is also catered for us casuals.

I am really sorry about this because Fortnite could be a long lasting source of fun for more people than it is now or will be in the future if things keep going this way.

First person mode: You've already got it in save the world, just port it over and add hands, it's that easy. This would be great because we all know how when you're in a close quarters battle and you have walls around one guy is going to have the advantage because he can see, the other guy will have his camera stuck in the middle of nowhere and won't be seeing anything. It doens't have to be another gamemode, you can just make so when you press H you go into first person and then press H again to go into third person :D.

Bring back the S2-S3 Map or make a brand new map that doesn't look like it was drawn by a toddler. No one asked for a desert/ice biome, I mean no one even goes there at all just like no one ever dropped moisty no one drop Paradise or happy hamlet, because it's in the corner of the map and only people that are scared of encounters go there, that playstyle in my opinion should not be encouraged with decent loot and a shot at winning the game when they landed in the middle of nowhere. I suggest making up something about time traveling to the past, and the next season can be related to that in some way, with the season 3 map but different skins (maybe gender bender idk)

Add a competitive mode with seasonal rewards for each rank, that will rank players based on HS% and KDA, so bots don't get into high ranks just by hiding and getting to top 10. The mode would have 100% material harvest and 1000/500/250 mats so people can't just turtle with metal/stone to make the game hella boring. The seasonal rewards would go as follows GOLD=Pickaxe, Platnium=Wrap/750 Vbucks, Diamond= Skin/1000 Vbucks, Master= Backbling,glider/1500 GrandMaster/Challenger= Wrap,skin and 2000 Vbucks for being such a high rank.

Remove planes or at least the minigun on them, remove ziplines, add back the normal impules and bouncers + make the launchpad rarity higher and there you go everyone still has alot of movement on the map and they can make more play with the bouncer and impulses again!

1 Pump with , remove tactical and heavy shotgun, because let's be honest they're not as effective as landing a clean headshot, and everyone carries around an SMG now so the tactical isn't use, if you remove the SMG's from season 5+ and add back the old ones then you can keep the tactical and heavy beacuse they will be viable unlike now where the meta is pump then switch to a SMG and pray to good you get good bloom.

Make bloom spread LESS than it does right now because SMG/Long range fights feel like the most rng thing that has ever excisted where the only guy that wins is the one with good bloom unless using an AK/Sniper. Remove the heavy sniper, it's just a bolt that deals more damage and reloads for 20 years with the removal of that add back the bolts you vaulted and remove the supressed sniper, because this game is not meant for stealth, but for constant aggression (that's why we have building right?)

It's so bad that I rarely ever win. Instead I just shut down and stop even thinking and reduce to only trying to shoot randomly at my opponent with it working only like 1 out of 1000 games.After these games I need about 20 min. to calm down and even then I might not be the same for the rest of the day. IDK if there is something I can do to help me stay calm but if there isn't, then I might just quit Fortnite.

Also in the last game I had like that, I shut down so much that I just dropped all my gear and let the final guy have a win. In which he killed me and flexed his builds then did take the L. That had my anxiety through the roof and extremely mad at the same time pushing me into a really scary state of trouble breathing and thinking strait. So again if anyone has any suggestions on how I can keep calm then I would really appreciate it.",FortNiteBR

It makes sense. Every game I have played today with squads or duos only once have I been able to save a downed team mate.

Instead, reward the 50 health or shield when you knock another player.

This way they get their reward and continue to fight, as opposed to receiving their boost and by finishing the other player.

This is a really simple change that I think would fix the issue quite a bit.

We met a kid who sounded maybe 6-10 years old, super nice, and we got to talking to him about school. In the background, we heard a woman begin shouting, *extremely* loud, cursing at someone. We must have heard the word ""Fuck"" about 10 times within about a minute. We both looked at each other confused, and she asked the kid, ""Is everything okay?"" He got really quiet and starting saying ""My grandma is mad"" and he was cut off by her shouting at the top of her lungs at him, telling him to ""Shut the fuck up!"". It was very uncomfortable. I whispered at my girlfriend that I wasn't sure what to do, so she asked him if his grandma was like this a lot, and he got very quiet and said ""I don't want to say, it's personal."" The shouting continued in the background for several minutes until the match was over.  


Both my ex and I were abused growing up, her especially, and it broke both of our hearts to hear these kids going through that. From our brief 10-minute conversation, it seemed the kids lived with their Grandma and she was like this a lot. I submitted a short letter on Fortnite's ""Contact Us"" page, but their options didn't have anything in regards to communications, so I picked ""Network Issue"".  


I know there's not much I can likely do, but it really sucked hearing this and if anyone knows of a way I could reach out to someone and make sure this kid is okay, that would be great. It would hurt both of us if these kids were abused, whether verbally and/or physically, and didn't try to help.",FortNiteBR

But this was supposed to be about L2 spam and if being honest it has never bothered me personally. Still I commented on the posts worried they would remove aim assist or completely mess up the nerf, that would not happen. Well how wrong was I. That happened and thank god they reverted it. So this is my way of admitting to all those guys who argued that if you see this, I was wrong, apologies.

I think the aim assist is fine and when they said in the revert post ""we will look into the issue further"" please don't. Just leave it be, it's fine. If the streamers/competitive guys still complain change it for tournaments or something but don't let the entire console population suffer because of complaints made such a tiny minority. Seriously the aim assist doesn't bother the majority of PC players, I'm sure of that.

Controllers need aim assist and I think this proved that fixing the L2 spam is a lot harder than we thought so just don't. It's fine and it's not that bad.

231,tommywantwingies,1550179992,aqoxsh,20,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aqoxsh/pop_up_cup_rules_and_default/,1,Pop Up Cup Rules And Default,"So this is probably an unpopular opinion here but I’ve now played around 20 Rounds with the pop up settings and it is a *HUGE* turn off for me.  Let me explain why.

A big reason I play this game is because I enjoy the building and playing with my friends.  I’m a casual gamer and I think the most kills I’ve ever had in a round is probably about 10.  I’m not great but I’m not horrendous.  Not the best in fights but I have my moments.

-A lot of my kills come from building smart, playing smart, healing at the right times and choosing when to engage an enemy.  Many times I can salvage a game and grab a win when a teammate goes down and gets thirsted by rushing the culprit and catching him at low health.  No more.  Now any fight I run into where my teammate is down I’m facing a stronger opponent.  It is erasing damage your teammate(s) do as you may just be entering the fight.

-This, as a default, is handing even MORE power to the guys who routinely win with 12, 15, 18 kills or more.  They don’t need the extra help.  Someone that is that good I have absolutely no chance at killing unless my teammates have beaten up on him or I catch him healing.  The better players like this won’t even need to worry about carrying or using meds, another slot they can use and a disadvantage for players like me.

-Killing immediately after landing is now an absolute necessity or you’re pretty much done for.  You must kill to try and bank your shield quickly.  This is far more effective and faster than looking for shield and getting killed in the process of that by someone at 200 health because they already snagged two guys.  I enjoyed being somewhat conservative on landing, looking for a gun and a big pot before rushing.  No more.  The time spent looking for a better gun or shields is wasted, giving the very good players time to kill and shield up.

-Why are LARGE CORE MECHANICS of gameplay being imposed on default game modes?  I have been playing since DAY 1 on PlayStation and this has to be the **biggest change** to the way the game is played since friendly fire was turned off.

-Lucky finds like a Chug Jug, Slurp, Big Pots no longer have a competitive edge for casual players like me.  The guys that just wiped up two squads are all at 200 health, whereas looting was the only way to shield up before or by forcing a fight to grab shields from someone and praying they had them.  No more ... just reward the gun slingers.

-The guy that I get a 150 or 180 hit on thirsts me and walks into my teammates with 70 to 100 health left.  There’s no more outplaying the gun slingers.  They’re the alpha now.

In summary, these game parameter changes are going to kill the fun for me.  There is FAR too much emphasis on being a good *gun* fighter than being a good looter or a good teammate.  Why stack big pots and be the team medic when all you have to do is kill?  This style of gaming rewards the top tier of gameplay and gives people like me a far less shot and grabbing a victory Royale with maybe 7 or 8 kills.  That was the fun of the game for me.  I might not be the best but there was always a shot and now it seems a lot less likely.

Many people here will like the changes and I understand why.  I’m not here to claim that getting third partied isn’t frustrating or losing an 8 kill game to a guy that only has one kill is fun or fair but as it stands right now the game has completely shifted its focus to gun play as the META and everything else secondary.",FortNiteBR

I also wanted to ask how the new cap on materials feels and if they are enough for all end game shenanigans . and how does the new harvest rate feel compared to before ?

This wouldn’t be as much of an issue if epic put in ranked matchmaking but as of now, you’re constantly at a disadvantage when facing somebody who’s better than you. 

Hell, if you land at tilted and get lucky enough to get a gun, that’s free shield at the beginning of the game as is.

2-I care about what others think. I get paranoid that if I die to someone, they’d be saying “haha what a fucking bot”. That paranoia is the reason I no longer go on Playground fill.

Although the nerf to the aim assist they added today was terrible, the fact of the matter is is that the L2 spam is overpowered and there are countless videos and situations of proof.

Being a controller player doesnt make it rightful for you all to think that your ""disadvantage"" should translate over to mouse and keyboard users because you guys cant keep up. 

Mouse and Keyboard being full hand vs controller being plastic sticks or thumbs only is the dumbest arguement ever. If you want to use your whole hand go ahead and use MKB but blaming them for that is just nonsense. I use controller when I feel like slacking because of the free mobility and range, I can use it sitting or lying down, and it makes me feel less stiff at my desk. 

Controller isnt hell and you arent getting punished for being on controller if an overpowered ability such as L2 spam is taken out (not to be mistaken with aim assist). 

For the love of God, learn that MKB users have no control over your lack of ability to catch up to them because you guys use your thumbs.

This will probably get downvoted and lost but I just wanted to state my opinion and if you do see this and disagree, please comment and change my POV, I'm always open to discussion.

TLDR - MKB has no control over whether you guys use your thumbs or plastic sticks and implementing L2 spam because of your lack of full range arm movement is just stupid. Aim assist is fine but L2 spam isnt no matter how much you think you deserve it because you use controller.",FortNiteBR

If you dont have to even move in order to get what used to be so very rare (Big shields/Medkits), you can win a game simply by sitting, and waiting for the storm to lower people enough for you to 1 shot. Meanwhile you have a neverending health pool. I've already seen this being taken advantage of and I'm very unimpressed. 

The updated material cap was introduced to make things more competitive, and to make more competitive streamers return to the game as people have been unhappy with the meta. They feel it isnt as combative and more focus is on building. 

So why then go and completely counteract why you introduced the material cap. People aren't going to really build anymore anyway, and they havent been.

For example, my first 10 games this morning trying out the new update.

6/10 ended with me and my friend being 3rd partied (nothing you can do about that lol) with around 30 people remaining

But 4/10 of those games ended with us in top 10, and not being able to even touch these people. 

One game in particular though where we had lowered them down below 50 health (no shield as we already knocked that off of the guys), and we thought these guys were vulnerable. So we rushed them after 5 seconds of regrouping. In that time they turned around and engaged a separate duo that had just escaped from the storm. One kill each and they were both back up to about 95 Health. Each drinks 2 minis which takes about 3 seconds.... putting them back at almost full in a matter of 5 seconds. Which without this change should have made them vulnerable for atleast 10-15 seconds. As they healed up. (Medkits on top of the Minis.) But no. They were able to manipulate the game mechanics to gain an advantage. And yes I can see they added it as a ""Incentive to get kills"" but how many people are going to think that way and not abuse that system? Just a thought but.... if you want things to be more competitive... add a ""Competitve Solo/Competitive Duo/Competitive Squads"". But please dont continue to destroy a game I've progressively been improving on, and getting used to with things like this. You're catering more to competitive players on what used to be a casual, fun kid oriented game. This isnt an MLG tournament guys and not everyone plays that way... please. I really dont wanna just have to drop this game like that.... I've always had fun, but it just isnt fun knowing that the mechanics are able to be bent in a way that wasnt intended. 

I'm doubtful ANYONE cares about this though. Because I'm not Ninja.... 

I hope this isnt forever. But goodbye fortnite.... it's been a good run 😭💔",FortNiteBR

This game is fucking amazing! I haven't had this much fun playing with friends or solo since the early 2000s with Halo and early COD. It feels like you guys are dedicated to making a unique game. It also seems that your developers spend as much time making new content as I spend playing the game. Which is rare in todays age of copypasta shooters like COD, Battlefield. 

In short I just wanted to say Thank You. I appreciate what you guys are doing and creating with Fortnite. Keep up the hard work and thanks for listening to your community!

Here are my suggestions:


- Get rid of stretched res, since that’s not an option on console (and for the sake of the viewers lol)

- Limit the amount of keys you can bind, to equal the amount a console player has on his/her controller.

- Add a cap at 30 fps, across all platforms, I think that’s been proven to be necessary (thx lupo&lt;3)

- Add a “mess up your aim” feature, that messes up all aim with a mouse every 5 seconds, to equal the lack of consistency the resent nerf has had on controller aim. Either that or just vault the mouse completely, let them aim with the arrow keys.

- Also make their loading screens longer on purpose during pop up cups, so they don’t have that extra time to queue up.

I don’t want to see this community be divided more than it already is on this, but as a console player, I really do not want to play with my friends on pc or to play pop ups. I just don’t think playing at such a disadvantage is fun. It also stings a little that Epic is letting the pc community dictate console play. It really feels like they don’t really care that much about the console community. At the end of the day, you hardly see any console players in the pro scene, so how “op” was using a controller? At times it could be advantageous but overall it was nothing compared to mouse and keyboard.

Sure, spamming the ads could give you an unfair advantage now and again (if you knew how to actually do it right and not just spam), but did pc players really need to complain? A pc player in the same situation doesn’t needs to ads on their smg because they can just hip fire with their mouse and get almost 100% accuracy, while us console players will mainly be flicking around wildly hoping to land that last shot or two we needed. In the the examples shown on reddit of the ads spam I remember thinking “but nobody would stand still in smoke”, and “that smg clip would be even easier with a mouse”. Like are we going to sit here and pretend that mkb players can’t literally have almost perfect hip fire accuracy with a smg after a pump shot? Because the amount of control and accuracy a mouse grants you has sometimes made me disgusted in clips I’ve seen on YouTube and reddit. I won’t stop playing fortnite because of this, but literally all my friends have found their excuse to stay on Apex now, regardless of ALL the other fixes implemented today.

Perfect explanation by r/mbarbul.

PC: „AiM AsSist iS tOo StRoNg!“ 

Console:“ThEy BuILd qUiCkeR aNd EdiT LiKe A gOd.“

So as you can see we have different complaints from the two corners. 
Let us talk about the pc player complain. 
Aim Assist is really not op. The Aim Assist is needed, because without it would be like controlling a plane with a toaster. Every console-shooter has it. If you are a good with m/kb your aim should be better, because you don‘t a help like this. You can shoot with incredible precision if you take some training and the right sens in consoderation. A 5 second delay just fucks the game up for console players. You can not find CQC with a pump and smg. 
The main problem for this nerf was the aim
Assist spam. This was clearly op, but to prevent spam we need a really small delay WHEN you start to abuse it. Only then the player should be punished for it. If you tap the L2 button for 5 times in one second this abusing and should be registered by the system. Only in cases like this!

The second complain is about the better building and edit possibilities on pc. 
The main problem here is that the controller is compared to m/kb just inferior for games, where you need a lot of buttons. The precision of the mouse also helps to edit really fast, if you practice it. There is not really a solution for it. The only fair solution would be to separate the tournaments and dont make them crossplay. 
Or should epic nerf the building abilities of pc players like they did with the aim assist? 
This nerf is just crap.

As we all hopefully know, Aim Assist has been a touchy subject. Aim assist, which was available for controller players, allowed their crosshairs to stick to players they put their crosshairs over, hence allowing them to hit more shots. This was completely justified, as controller players use their thumbs to aim. But this is where the problem began. People began finding out that you could use ADS to reset your aim assist. Hence began the era of Aim Assist spam!

PC players were very upset, and wether this anger was valid is up to you. So, Epic Games nerfed it in 7.4, today’s update, and this is where we are right now.

Here’s what they did wrong:
- The cooldown mechanic was implemented wrong. Simply zooming in or zooming out quickly (like using a shotgun then swapping to smg) begins the cooldown. This can make close range battles extremely wonky.
-Controller players are now at an even bigger disadvantage in crossplay lobbies (such as pop-up cups). While top controller players will still be able to hang, it will take a bit for people to get used to this change. Not to mention Secret Skirmish is fast approaching, and this will be a game changer for controller players.
- Console players are affected. The use of ADS spam on console is much less then controller on pc. Not to mention, everyone could do it. This nerf unfairly affected console players.

How can Epic fix this?
Here are some simple solutions.
- Make the cooldown apply only to AR’s, Deagle’s, and other affective mid-long range weapons. This way close quarters combat can remain natural.
- Make the change apply only to controller on pc players (this is what I’m hoping for)
- Remove the change and rework

Lets hope the 2 games can co-exist i love them both

I've noticed a sharp uptick in good players that I honestly don't stand a chance against. For the past 30 matches, I've been having trouble getting more than one kill in the early game before I just get destroyed by someone who plays much more than me. 

I drop, I grab a gun, and die.

It's gotten so bad to the point where I'm getting extremely nervous in the early game. My heart rate raises up as if I'm in the final circle in a 1v1, which makes me choke and lose even harder. I can't even do cold drops because I know I'll just be stomped on by the first person I see.

I'm pretty sure I used to be a decent player, but I'm just encountering hardcore die-hard players match after match after match. I haven't been able to have a good fight since last season, it's either I stomp or get stomped. I'm not sure if I'm getting worse or if everyone is getting better around me. I've been trying hard to learn and get the muscle memory going to no avail, I can't learn if I die instantly.

A ranked system would help so much. Being able to fight against people my own skill level would be amazing. I say it should be kept separate from the normal playlist. There should be ranked solos, duos, and squads separate from the normal modes.

I'm not going to go into big detail on how it should be implemented because I'd like some discussion, but as long as it's separate and not forced on anyone then I'll be happy at least. What do you guys think?

I don't even care if I happen to have the lowest rank. I just want a good fight for once.",FortNiteBR

I have played a couple of matches after the update l, and my aim is so messed up the 5 seconds cool down is too long, and makes aiming soooooo inconsistent, especially in close fights situations where you use your shotgun then switch to your SMG.

The first shotgun shoot will snap to the enemy, and the moment you switch to your SMG, you basically have no aim assist at all, which makes it VERY hard to hit your shots.

I understand that the snap on mechanic was OP in some cases, but after the nerf it's just messed up. It adds so much inconsistency to the fights, because during the fight after every shoot you are thinking is it gonna snap now or not, it's like adding something that messes up with your aim every 5 seconds.

I honestly think that the 5 seconds are to long, so adjusting it maybe to 3 seconds might be better or 2.5, or just revert it back to how it was.

Competiting against mouse and keyboard player in the pop up cups is gonna way more difficult that how it was.

You might think ooh this guy started whining already just get God. But no I have been playing shooter games for more than 15 years by now I played competitively, and casually, so I know what I'm talking about.

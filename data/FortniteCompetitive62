I only played League before (never played shooters actively) so I know I'm not as experienced as many other players but I think my sensitivity is the villain here. I think I play with 1800 DPI and 0.23 sensitivity. I know that most of the pro players play with significantly lower sensitivity but when I try to reduce it, it feels so slow that I immediately increase it again. Do you think that if I lower it, even though I've been using this sensibility for months I'll get used to it and I'll improve my aim? What sensibility values do you recommend me to try?",FortniteCompetitive

I understand that some people may not have a mouse with extra buttons, but since I do I'm going to focus on that. 

I strongly believe that having your build pieces bound to your mouse (G502, in my case) allows you to equip your full build arsenal to your right hand, whilst allowing full mobility of your character with your left. To me, that is a perfect mix. However, as stated in the first line of this post, I've seen plenty of people plus many popular streamers using their keyboard buttons to equip walls, stairs, etc. (And yes, I'm aware that some people might bind ""K"" to their mouse and use that for their wall, for example, proving that they can be using their mouse to build, however not everyone does this.)

Spamming two weapons of any kind is a cheesy and broken mechanic. 

Creating category specific inventory slots: three weapons, two equipment/healing; would cause greater punishment to those looking to abuse it, but still allow the choice to play that way. 

For a while the pros relying on the crutch of the double shotgun META will use double shotgun and AR. After not too long shotgun, ar, and snipe/splode (yes choose between the two) will be the best and most balanced way set up a loadout.

They are trying very well, but also too hard, to create weapon balance. The not so obvious choice but the most sufficient and logical one is to reduce the weapon slot count, instead of changing unrelated mechanics and changing far too many aspects of the game at once. 

Work smarter not harder EPIC.

This is why they add support for a variety of platforms (mobile, console, pc, switch).

**The Problem**

The skill gap for Fortnite is massive. Players are required to dedicate several hours a day to get better at the game. If you don't play enough then you will fall below the average and get destroyed by the common pro player and Twitch streamer.

Currently since the game lacks a practice mode you are required to play the game with other people and have no easy way to learn building unless you can play constantly.

Having this massive skill gap ruins the fun for noob and casual players which make up the majority of the player base.

**Epic's goal is to give players alternatives to building to provide a level playing ground for everyone**

The C4 and clinger buff, and shotgun and building nerf explain this. Explosives are a perfect counter for building and shotguns.

**How I think this could be fixed**

Adding casual and competitive matchmaking options allow players to decide if they want to play seriously with other skilled players. There are a handful of competitive snipes groups and I can guarantee pros would want to play with other skilled players to improve and have more enjoyment.

Almost all games with a competitive scene have this option and it allows you to decide how you want to play. People who just want to chill out can do so and if you want to play serious and play with other skilled players.

**TL;DR: The Material nerf isn't just Epic blindly nerfing things, they want to allow new people to be able to play and have a good time instead of pros building circles around them.**",FortniteCompetitive

But, this is not completely true. Its not the building that causes lag, its the players that are often inside the buildings that do. 

I have seen evidence to back this up in games I have played myself; when I am in a build fight with only one person and we both burn through a lot of mats, I never notice my frames dropping, even though there has been up to a few thousand materials placed nearby. The only times I have ever had bad frame drops and lag were in 50 vs 50 and in Tilted Towers. In 50 vs 50 my frames sometimes drop to single digits near the endgame, and this is because of the amount of people in a small area, not the building. When Tilted Towers was first introduced lag was a problem, and this was because of the amount of players in a small area. 

Another situation where people think building causes lag is in scrim games. Often it is thought that the lag in the endgame is caused by evryone building, but it isn’t, its caused by the number of players in a small area which can be very large in scrim games. 

TL;DR: Lag that is often thought to be caused by building is actually caused by lots of players in a small area.

Lately I’ve felt pretty stagnant in my gameplay, I have some obvious flaws I’m trying to address but can’t seem to get over the hump with limited interactions against good players. Most of my issues involve advanced building tactics against good players, as well as efficient building, and quick edits. I would honestly say at least 90% of the opponents I face I don’t need to implement anything special in my play, or I’m outmatching my opponent already. Every once in awhile though, I face an opponent that is severely out pacing me in building.

With all this being said, has anyone here found success in running solo snipes? Also, to climb the ladder in the Fortnite EXP discord, is it just about improving k/d and win rate?

I’ve been hesitant about joining a solo snipe discord, for whatever reason it makes me nervous. Maybe I’ll fearful I’ll be exposed for being asscheeks at this game, lol.

I truly only want to focus on improving, because I know with that the KD and WR will come. My goal at one point is to get involved in the competitive scene. I’m 28 now, and I don’t feel as if I have a ton of time left to get involved even though it’s always been a pipe dream of mine. 

Thanks in advance.

Specifically they wanted the botlane duo roles to consist of more than just the classic duo of AD Carry and Support.

In fact, Riot decided that they wanted players to be able to essentially play any champion in any role. The community did not ask for this. This changes the core aspect of the metagame defined by certain roles being played in certain lanes. 

This led to a huge falloff both in fun, and eventually the player base, and as described by a pro player is due to a huge falloff in fun. As is explained by TL doublelift, sometimes a company may have a good idea, but the execution leads to the game being far less fun overall. There is no need to make drastic changes that are not necessary.

The article and post from r/leagueoflegends can be seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8t6xcn/tl_doublelift_faker_is_playing_taric_and_great_ad/?st=JIR8SYLT&amp;sh=169bcf75

Look at the comments. Sounds eerily similar to what we are seeing here. Just a month or two after the fact is all. 

TLDR: don’t shift the meta when that isn’t what is necessary, because even if it SEEMS like a good idea, it may wind up destroying the fun of the game.

Posted this on the main sub, wanted to hear your guys’ thoughts and opinions on the matter as well. I played league at master/challenger for years and perhaps playing ADC it affected me most so it was a direct correlation to my quitting. Really would hate to see the same happen in regards to building because I love this game.",FortniteCompetitive

When it comes to my setup, it's solid, no issues there I was able to spec everything out (this includes a 1080ti, 64 gb ram, i7 8086K, etc.) so my the only thing I would have to worry about is developing my own skill and muscle memory.

This is the first time I play ANY game on PC, and MANNNN has this flipped my world upside down. I'm used to being a really good console player and being able to pick anything up really quickly (typical pub stomper) but the peripherals on the PC are SO different to that of a console controller (for the better) that I'm just absolute GARBAGE ha.

I know it's only been two days but I'm wondering if any of you have any advice besides ""just play more""

There are some things I've noticed right off the bat, and they all pretty much revolve around terrible in game movement due to the fact that I'm not used to moving with WASD since I've always used my thumbs. Really If I want to make it a bit more abstaract, I'd say my issue is not being used to using anything other than my thumb and index finger as input devices despite being extremely good with a keyboard when it comes to other things such as typing (I'm a professional software developer so me and a keyboard are tight ha).

Some of the main things I've noticed:

- Tendency to only ever move forward (using W) and not really utilizing A and D to move side to side

- Tendency to just want to always sprint everywhere, including when I'm in a gun fight. I tend to be ""caught in the moment"" and my fingers continue to mash shift + W

- Even when I stop sprinting I always want to just ""keep moving forward""

- Only utilizing the mouse + w to move diagonally/side to side

Again a lot of it revolves around poor movement (WASD) and over utilization of W and Shift (sprint)

Epic seems to not want every battle to end up being a 700 material build off and honestly I’m not a fan either. I love build fights but lately getting into one and winning results in me not having any materials to pick up from my opponent and I have to immediately go farm for 5 minutes again. 


With this new model players will need to be more conservative of their materials in build fight and not just build to build. It creates a mentality of trying to get shots in more often than building causing fights to occur faster and end quicker. Also, having double material farming you don’t need to farm back up to 500 materials as long to have for your next fight. This would also put llamas in a great spot of giving you almost half full materials.


In my opinion this model puts emphasis on fighting more and less building to the sky, let’s build fights still occur, and doesn’t keep you out of the fight gathering materials as long between fights. Thoughts on this? ",FortniteCompetitive

Currently it seems you need to sacrifice one for the other (higher sens = faster building/worse accuracy)

What do you guys think the sweet spot is?  Personally I currently run 8/8 sensitivity and feel it helps me out build most people, but I find myself missing some pump shots and AR headshots I'd probably hit with lower sensitivity.  

I consider myself a top tier console player, but then I go watch NickMercs drop 12 kills at tilted effortlessly with lackluster building skill and top notch accuracy (his sensitivity is 6/5)

He builds with purpose and plays with a lot of intelligence and AR/shotgun accuracy.  I was wondering if the competitive community agrees with this mindset and that maybe lowering sensitivity to around 6 is a smarter play.

Let me know what you guys think.

Hopefully they separate building and weapon sensitivity and make this all a moot point!",FortniteCompetitive

I always wondered why it felt easier.

I had an epiphany today that made me realize that turtlers had to click in response to having a wall shot down in the past. Now with Turbo Building, all they have to do is hold down LMB and a wall is instantly placed when their existing wall is destroyed. When you turtle with Turbo Building, you are turtling **proactively**; ***not reactively*** like clicking required you to in the past. 

Now, let's get into the nitty gritty with milliseconds. Turbo Building has always had a 'time-out' delay of 150ms (0.15 seconds) for every freshly built peice. This seems like it exists to prevent turtling abuse, but does it really? Let's do the math.

The fire rate number for each weapon listed in your inventory, is the number of rounds per second it fires. Here are some sample calculations:

    1/13  = ~77ms &lt;-- Window to punish a turtler with 1/2 shot(s) from a Tactical SMG (16/17/18dmg, 2 shots possible if server latency is high enough for the turtle).
    1/9   = ~111ms &lt;-- Window to punish a turtler with a single shot from a Supressed SMG (20/21/22dmg).
    1/5.5 = ~181ms &lt;-- AR's are literally so fucking slow that they can't punish turbo building turtles.

With Turbo Building, the 150ms delay is almost inhuman when you take into consideration that it's an action being taken proactively, not reactively, AND that the average human visual reaction time is around 200-250ms.


**TL;DR: High firerate weapons can only get one hit in before turtles abusing Turbo Build can patch up if no outstanding server latency is involved. AR's are literally useless versus turtlers because Turbo Building is too fast.**",FortniteCompetitive

73,triggeredplayer,1529644991,8sytf0,15,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8sytf0/re_counterplay_and_play_styles/,4,RE: Counterplay and Play Styles,"The most recent news update by [Epic games](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/counterplay-and-play-styles?sessionInvalidated=true) has left me and many others uneasy due to what they have said. A change to building will change the game drastically, for better or for worse, since building is such an integral part of Fortnite.


I have some issues with the post that I hope Epic will see.

&gt;We strongly believe that the evolution of Fortnite supports a **wide range** of play styles and counterplay. 


This statement is a bit incorrect: when you boil it down, there are two play styles: passive play and aggressive play. Both have their merits and I don't think either hard counters the other, as it greatly depends on the players level of skill. What I can say though, is that killing people is substantially more fun + satisfying than sitting in a 1 by 1 box for the entire game. Sure, there are many methods of countering each playstyle, but there really are only two play styles. This statement kind of shows a lack of understanding of the game.


&gt;Currently, the superiority of shotguns, rockets, and uncapped building are such a dominant play style in the **final circle** that most other strategies are being drowned out.


I wish they expanded on this by showing us how they arrived at this conclusion. I'm going to take their statement at face value and assume that Epic arrived at this conclusion by looking at the hard data that's not available to us. Looking at data alone can be deceptive: if it's one team against another in the final circle, regardless of how you down the first player, the fight will most likely result in a close quarter fight. Regardless of whether the fight is in the sky or on the ground: close quarter fights are the most effective way of wiping a team- how often do you wipe the last team from a distance? 

So, how do you close the distance to get into a close quarter fight? By building!

What are the most effective close range weapons to use? Shotguns and rocket launchers!

Do you see what I'm getting at right now? Shotguns and rocket launchers will be inherently used a lot in final circle fights, where it's usually 1 team against another. This high % of usage isn't a problem, and I hope they're not treating it as one. 


&gt;It’s important to support a variety of late game strategies, that don’t boil down to “just build lol”

Regardless of the strategy,  I guarantee that you will need to build. That's okay. Building is a great mechanic that makes this game great and unique, don't take the ""just build lol"" meme so seriously please. It's literally what enables most passive and aggressive plays.

&gt;Shotguns should be strong, but other weapons have room to grow. 

I agree, but it's okay for the data to show a skew. It's okay for some weapons to be used less than others. I think pistols and SMGs are great early game guns. But trying to balance them so that they're used as much as ARs, shotguns? That'd be a nightmare that wouldn't be worth the trouble nor the reward tbh.


Epic you've been the greatest game dev team to date and deserve every bit of success. If it was any other game I probably wouldn't even bother typing this up haha",FortniteCompetitive

Identical to Builder Pro except:
- Pressing Right on the D-pad enters Editor Mode (holding Circle (B) would still work)
- Pressing Triangle (Y) enters Combat Mode and pulls out the weapon in Slot 1 (pressing Circle (B) while in Build Mode would still pull out the last weapon you used)
- Holding Triangle (Y) pulls out your Pick Axe

Custom Load-out Layouts (optional)
- When enabled, splits the layout of your load-out from 1 row of 5 slots into 2 rows. Players choose which slots they want in which row.
For Example:
Row 1 - Slot 1, Slot 2, Slot 3
Row 2 - Slot 4, Slot 5
In-game Example:
Row 1 - Gold Scar, Blue Pump, Blue Tac
Row 2 - Mini Shields, Chug Jug
Another In-game Example:
Row 1 - Gold Scar, Gold Heavy, C4, Gold Bolt
Row 2 - Mini Shields
- While in Combat Mode, pressing Triangle switches between rows highlighting the row you are currently using in your custom load-out.
- While in Combat Mode, LB/RB switches between slots, but only between the slots of the row you are currently using in your custom load-out. 

Pros:
- Quicker Editing
- Quicker and more reliable weapon swapping
- Custom layouts (allows for even more reliable weapon swapping and quicker healing. all weapons are now only one to two button presses away aside from a single slot)

Cons:
- Holding Triangle to pull out your Pick Axe means marginally slower farming",FortniteCompetitive

A fight that otherwise would have been decided by skill is suddenly over.  I would prefer if the material nerf was undone, and I don't want to see Epic reduce the material cap.  I would rather see them address turtling in some other way.  Here are two items that I think would hamper turtling and add interesting new options for counter play.

1) Laser gun: A gun which shoots lasers that completely ignore builds---they don't damage builds, and they pass through them and hit players who are otherwise obstructed.  The damage would have to be on the low side.  The ammo could probably be unlimited, or it could have a charge like the jet pack and get used up (with lower damage output if the ammo is unlimited).

2) Firebomb: A throwable item that, upon contact, sets all materials in a certain radius on fire.  While on fire, the builds would have large holes that can be shot through, they would be uneditable, and a player would take incremental damage while touching.  The initial blast should do some amount of damage as well, but not nearly as much as a grenade or rocket.  The fire would slowly damage the builds.  Possibly, it could spread to adjacent builds if the players don't destroy the affected area, but I'm not sure about that part.

What other items/changes would allow building to still be the best way to temporarily defend yourself and control the flow of a fight, but discourage the use of building for long term defense and hiding?",FortniteCompetitive

Then depending on the team's size you are put on a map that's mirrored down the middle. It would start how paintball does, everyone on the opposite side, count down to 0 and then game on, last alive wins. 

You could maybe make it like halo where they had like the sniper/rocket launcher/etc. in a certain spot on the map no matter what to create zones teams would fight over. Or even not and have a straight up fight. 

The beginning game would have strats and so would end game. Some might decide to gather mats for build fights other might zerg rush. Also in this mode they would take out bloom. It would be a spread or something similar to CS. Takes all RNG out, gets straight to the point. Win or lose. They could then add a ranking system to this mode and create tiers creating an elo system which seems to keep players around longer, so they can climb the ladder. 

A mode like this would completely freshen up Fortnite for me, what do y'all think?

If there is a tie when the timer runs out, the tiebreaker will be determined by whoever has the most kills. This will force most teams left to engage in final battles since the teams don’t really know how many kills other teams have. Unless one team has so many kills that they feel comfortable just turtling it out, but thats not even that bad of a scenario because that gives an incentive to get kills early/mid game in order to have a high kill count in the final circle. So a team in that position late game will get rewarded for their risks early game. And a team that played passively and didn’t take risks early on will have to take risks in the late game. This is a pretty good balance in my opinion. It will be pretty hype since its a “final brawl” aswell. This could also be used in a matchmaking/elo game mode.",FortniteCompetitive

- Building quickly
- Rotating in intelligent ways
- Map elevation positioning
- Aiming down sights
- Not getting nervous
- Calling out accurately
- Looting quickly

What I need to work on:
- Building more intelligently
- Editing quicker
- Taking less damage during fights
- Hip fire accuracy, specifically shottys 
- Landing more headshots

My biggest issue I have is thinking I’m building faster than I am. I’m not sure if it’s an epic issue or a me issue. Ever since the update two prior to this last one, my aiming is so off that I’m forced to play on 5,5 sens. That’s a major disadvantage in a build fight, ESPECIALLY considering right before this update with the diagonal sens, I was aiming perfectly on 7,7.  

I’m hesitant to blame it on epic constantly changing the way sensitivity works because none of my friends seem to have the same issue. Clearly there is an issue though because I didn’t just lose all motor functions and become unable to play anywhere near my normal sens overnight. 

This is how it affects me: I now find myself constantly Y,Y ing. Instead of switching from gun -&gt; map -&gt; place build -&gt; gun, I’m always just going gun -&gt; map -&gt; gun, which obviously leaves me wide open to shots. I lose almost 80% of my health in a fight when this happens. 

The simple/obvious solution is to just put in the time to redevelop the muscle memory but this has been a constant learning and relearning process. It’s getting stale. It makes me not want to keep playing. 

So my questions are: how do I address what I need to work on most effectively? Which streamers should I watch? What can I do immediately in-game? 

As for sens problems, if anyone has experienced this same phenomenon, I’d appreciate any insight as to how to deal with it. Currently, I have no choice but to sacrifice build speed for accuracy which is fucking ridiculous. Epic needs to allow console an aim sens and build sens but I have little to no faith that that’ll make it into any upcoming patches so any real solution is welcome. I’m at the point where I can literally see my skill ceiling. I can physically touch it thanks to not being able to use high sens and honestly it has ruined the entire experience for me. I don’t want to stop playing but I have such a competitive nature that I’d rather stop playing altogether than have to keep playing at half my potential through (what I assume to be) no fault of my own.

No longer would your load out show 1 row of 5 slots. Instead, there would be 2 rows. 1 row of 3 slots and 1 row of 2 slots underneath it.

How this would work is when you press triangle (or Y on Xbox) you would switch to the first weapon in the top row of your load out. Pressing down on the D-pad would switch in-between rows. Right and left bumper would still switch between slots, but only between the slots of the row you were on. What this would do would make every single slot in your load out no more than two button presses away. No more filtering through 5 slots.

Also, when enabled, if you are in building mode, pressing triangle (or Y) one time would switch to your weapon first instead of your axe first. No more pressing the button twice to get to your weapon.

I feel like this is a very simple solution to a very annoying disadvantage us console players have. We could keep most important weapons/items in the top row and ones we use less often in the bottom row so they don’t get in the way.

Although pump and tac would require small buffs for this to work, I think a one shotgun carry limit would be an extremely good thing for the meta of this game.

Right now, double shotgun is absolutely and unequivocally the #1 way to win CQC fights. If you don’t have a heavy shotgun, you are almost guaranteed to lose close range battles against players of similar skill if you are not carrying 2 shotguns. I think adding a one shotgun carry limit would bring out a whole new array of setups.

For example, SMG’s and LMG’s would skyrocket in usage rates. Throwables such as C4, Clingers, Impulses, etc, would also likely see a huge increase in usage as you would have room now that you aren’t essentially required to carry two shotguns. Double carrying meds/shield would also become viable without having to sacrifice a second shotgun.
 
It’s not as though removing double shotgun would totally ruin CQC, but it would open up so many more viable options. Double shotgun is getting so repetitive to me, and I’d really love to see a change like this.

There has been a ton of discussion regarding competitive fortnite and the current problems it faces.  This was shown on full display with the European tournament going on right now.  A player posted a clip of his duo game play with 29 people left in an extremely tiny circle, everyone boxed up and hiding from each other.  This is a major problem.  It is not fun for the viewers and im sure its not fun for the players. 

My suggestion is that there should be zero points awarded to placement.  Whether you are killed first or you are the last man standing you receive zero points for this.  I believe this is the only way to truly do away with the turtle problem that is currently happening.  I suggest that points are only gained through eliminations.  This would encourage more aggressive game play and would discourage hiding the entire game only to move in when forced by circle and then boxing up again.  Sure you could still do it but you would be at a huge disadvantage for a couple reasons.  One, you would be getting less points as the game progressives when compared to the more aggressive players.  Secondly, if you were not actively trying to kill and then gather loot you would be way behind the other more aggressive players in the late game as they would have been collecting drop down loot. 

Even with doing away with point associated with placement you would still have players who box up but i believe it would be less of a problem and more than likely not as rampant as it is now.  I could imagine some players might box up and wait for engagements to come to them but again this would put them at a disadvantage kills wise. 

I think this point system should be tested in scrims to see how it does.  I am pretty confident something close to this is what will eventually win out.  There needs to be ZERO points awarded for placement or you will always have the turtle meta.  I dont think Epic needs to nerf mats or make other changes to the game, the proper point system needs to be created and that is one that only awards points per eliminations.

One more counter argument that just popped into my head is this:  Wouldn't a point system based only on eliminations be kind of lucky (like the keemstar friday tournaments)? No.  Since its all pro players playing each other the games would not play out like the keemstar friday tournaments.  Watching people jumping out of the bus would become a major part of these tournaments.  You would need to juggle risk/reward when jumping.  Do you want to jump far away from players to loot up but possibly miss out on eliminations as you traverse the map?  Do you see a group of people jump and then jump soon after so you know you can get some fast eliminations.  Since you can see when people jump you can decide your strategy in real time.",FortniteCompetitive

There's literally no way to counter C4 right now. At least with a grenade launcher or rocket launcher you have ways to get around them. With C4 though there's literally nothing you can do about it. The person using it has the power to instantly delete anything in front of them.

The worst thing is that it ruins build fights. If you get out built you can just drop down and C4 everything down and get a free kill. There's no skill in that, it's a super cheap tactic that doesn't reward skilled play. It's like noob tubing in MW2.

I understand that Camping and turtle meta should be viable strategies but this game should really start rewarding players for killing people.  


Simple things like making legendary loot, grenade and rocket launchers available on Drops could go a long way. Make the drops even give resources. Make only one or two drops appear per circle and signal them on the map. 

Giving points per kill is clearly not enough. Make people want to fight and reward them!

It's not really an idea I'm a fan of personally, but sure, it's just a LTM and I can ignore it. But here's the thing I'm worried about:

As we know, Epic has been using LTM's to see how things would work if they were different and sometimes change stuff in normal modes as a result. I'm 99% sure that they aren't adding this LTM just for the sake of it, but rather to see how the game would be if there was less building in general and less ammo. 

For some time now, Epic has been updating the game in favor of casual playerbase (nerfing mats, adding stupid items) and in my opinion, what could come out of this LTM is that materials could be nerfed even more, as well as ammo.

I really hope that I'm wrong, because the game could easily become really boring because of this.

Short introduction to me, to give this idea a little more profound base.  My name is likandoo and I am currently #15 worldwide in alltime solo wins on PC: [https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/twitchtvLIKANDOO](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/twitchtvLIKANDOO) 

I was mostly focussing on Solos but recently also dipped into the Pro Scene and also Scrims. I also studied game design so I think I have a pretty good understanding what certain changes might trigger in the meta, because that is what I literally learned in my studies :D

**Here is my idea on how to counter the turtle meta:**

Make a Tournament Format where you play X amount of games for example 10. But you only count your best Y amount of games for example 5.

On top of that you make a nice point system where both positioning and kills matter.

**For example:**

**First:** 100 Points

**Second:** 70 Points

**Third:** 50 Points

**Top 10:** 10 Points

**and each KILL** = 10 Points

\*\*\* OBV those numbers are just examples and can be fine tuned / tested I literally pulled them out of my ass \*\*\*

This structure automatically makes it that every team will play way more aggressive because even if you die early its not the end of the world because you still have 9 more games to get 5 good scores in. The numbers are obv to be discussed. But I think its very important in a battle royale game to give the teams room to ""fuck up"" / to eliminate ""RNG"" as well.

Otherwise everyone will play WAY to passive to make it a fun to watch esports title.

Trymacs a big german Youtuber was hosting Custom Tournaments on a regular base until it got shut down by epic. And I played in one of the DUO Tournaments with a structure like this where only 5 out of 10 games counted. 

There was almost no turtelling at least not to the extend where it gets annoying to watch.

The Problem with this approach is that it is VERY HARD to understand for the Teams and for the Viewers who is in the lead which games count etc...

But for this epic could make a automatic Scoreboard which is visible to everyone after the games and it automatically takes the best 5 games from all teams into account and shows how many points you are in the lead / you have to make up to get first.",FortniteCompetitive

For those of you that don't know me, I'm a mod of this sub, I also admin and host snipes on our discord server.  I'm extremely proud of our progress and want to thank you all as a community for coming together to make this a reality.   
That being said, I am posting this as a user and a player, nothing more.  
  
I'm going to come out and say it just in case some people aren't aware, Battle Royale is a competitive game mode.  Competitive games have large skill gaps, with very little luck involved.  BR's are heavily luck-based, from loot drops to rotations.  Fortnite adds in additional layers of luck with Bloom, health/shield system, and extreme storms.    
When I say say ""extreme storms"" I'm referring to storm RNG that can lead a team to be at a **severe** disadvantage depending on storm rotation - in no other popular BR it is this extreme, and that's because of materials.  You don't have time to loot, farm materials, and run for 4 minutes to the storm.  Not to mention half the map also has the same problem, so you'll all run into each other as soon as you get into the storm.    

  
For these points, in my personal opinion, we should look to move out of the Battle Royale game mode for competitive player.    

The solution: **Arena mode.**  
Highly discussed and suggested in the competitive community - an Arena mode would pit two equal and small teams against each other - removing luck from the equations in almost every way.   
 
It's the mechanics of Fortnite we love.  The building, the smooth, fast-paced fun gameplay.  It's the RNG we don't.  
Arena mode could work in a variety of ways, whether it's spawning a small team on opposite mirrored sides of an arena with the same loot, or something else.    

    
**tl;dr**  

I'm not sure of the exact details - I'd just like to start a discussion on how the competitive community would feel about moving away from Battle Royale for ranked and competitive Fortnite play.

This is my first true attempt at going pro in a video game as I love this game and feel I have the ability. 

I have one concern. I often see posts about changes that need to be made for the competitive scene. Often people talk about increasing materials, smaller matches such as 4v4 and making kills the main scoring system. I’m not saying that these suggestions are not legitimate but they make me concerned about losing the survival aspect of a Battle royale.

I think one of the great parts of a Battle royale is that there is no single way to approach the game. You can land somewhere secluded and load up on materials or you can drop into tilted and go for instant kills/good loot. You can also land somewhere in between. Regarding materials, I am okay with where it stands as this encourages spreading people out. If I know I can land tilted and still come out with decent materials I’ll be less inclined to land somewhere geared towards gathering material. To me the whole point of the game is survival as only one person wins. If riding the border is your strategy then so be it. 

I worry that these suggestions are leading towards stripping the survival aspect and focusing simply on kills and scores. If someone wins a million dollar fortnite tournament with 2 kills by landing at a random house and riding the border, I would be fine with that. They simply played smarter than the next guy. I don’t think we should we force players into combat if they would rather play passively. That’s what makes Fortnite unique in my opinion. 

Now obviously there is room for separate competitive scenes that include 4v4’s and 2v2’s but I think we should not lose sight of the true Battle royale experience in the competitive scene. ",FortniteCompetitive

From the past few updates, we have seen that Epic is shifting away from the build-shotgun meta. And I agree with the shotgun nerf completely. But the building nerfs get me. They aren't even that bad on their own, but it's showing that they don't want to have a skill-based mechanic like building being the only difference between a good player and a bad player.

So my question, to you, is would you rather the game be about aim and well-placed shots? Or a game with a complex mechanic that separates it from competitors. Fortnite is not a special BR game. It's only separation are skill-based mechanics like building and the ability to win any fight you're in. That's why good players are much easier to spot in Fortnite than H1 or PUBG.

This game is very important as an esport because it can change the way the public looks at them. So it's very important that Epic don't screw things up and make the game less enjoyable to watch. So when they start nerfing the only mechanic that makes the game fun to watch it is scary to me that they are screwing up the huge opportunity that they basically had handed to them.

Let's talk about LTM's. We can start with Blitz. In the first time Blitz was in the game, mats were at 200% for roughly a day before they nerfed it to 150%. This made roughly 58% of people on /r/FortniteBR unhappy. (it was 58% downvoted). In Blitz v2 I believe they left it at 150% but I'm not sure (if someone can tell me please do). Then in 50v50v3 they nerfed mats. They nerfed llamas 1500 mats to 600 mats which I agree with, but the change brings further implications.

Overall, Epic is trying to ignore the community's wishes. Even after being downvoted to oblivion on the main subreddit, they didn't change the blitz mats. They are moving away from the only good mechanic in the game and it's saddening to see them kill this game. A game that we all love and we are good at. Epic is trying to make this game only appeal to casuals, and that's fine, but they need a competitive mode before they start making changes for casuals. Opt in SBMM would work greatly, and there are a lot of things that Epic could do to improve and fix their game. And they have that chance, but times running out.",FortniteCompetitive

If we compare a blue m14 to a gold scar, the scar does 3 more damage a shot. The scar has the same properties as the m14 aside from this (it has a different model and sound, but that doesn't affect gameplay), so the only real difference is a slight damage boost. From a balance standpoint, this is a reasonable difference in effectiveness between a blue weapon and a gold one of the same type. The difference is certainly not negligible, but it is not so large that someone who has a blue tier of a weapon is at a serious disadvantage when facing someone who has the gold tier. This isn't just true when comparing a blue rifle to a gold one; however, it's true of all the rarities within every weapon type in the game. A green tactical SMG to a purple, a blue sniper to a gold, a gray pistol to a blue: the difference is not large. The reason this is the case is so that weapon rarities have an effect on the game, but not an effect that causes them to play too large of a part in deciding the winner of a fight.

Enter the heavy shotgun. The heavy shotgun equips much faster, has a tighter spread, deals between 13 - 32 more max headshot damage (depending on tier), and shoots faster than the pump. It doesn't simply deal more damage; it does everything far better than the pump does, from damage to range to even equip speed. The only exception is that the pump deals slightly more bodyshot damage, but that means little when the heavy does significantly more headshot damage. The tighter spread also means that you can deal high damage from a much further range than the pump can anyway. And then there's double heavy shotgun. Double heavy shotgun is a monstrosity; it shoots even faster than a single tactical shotgun does and deals tons more DPS than double pump. Once someone is running double heavy shotgun, it's inarguable that you are at a serious disadvantage against them unless you can do the same. 

I get that this subreddit is delighted about the shotgun headshot multiplier nerfs, but you have to realize that neglecting to tweak the heavy shotgun at all was undeniably a mistake. Now, it's a pump on steroids and a pump user is at a significant disadvantage against a heavy user. The heavy needs to be nerfed in some way (maybe just headshot damage) to lower this disadvantage.

**TL;DR:**
Higher weapon rarities were designed to give an advantage, but not one that weighs the scales in favor of the luckier person too heavily. The heavy shotgun completely defies this by doing everything better than the pump can instead of only dealing more damage like the higher weapon rarities usually do. It has a tighter spread (making it deal more damage at a distance), shoots faster (making it more viable as a single shotgun), and even equips faster than the pump does (giving you a serious advantage in build battles where every second counts). Finding a higher tier of a weapon simply should not give you as large of an advantage as the heavy shotgun does.",FortniteCompetitive

I attempted to come up with a fun, fast paced game mode that would be mostly skill based and have less random outcomes.

Health &amp; Shields
- Players gain 25 shield as a reward each time they eliminate another player
- Health slowly regenerates up to 75hp automatically unless you’re in the storm

These settings would reward skilled players who win fights.

Looting &amp; Farming
- Only blue, purple, and gold guns drop
- Floor Loot spawns 100% of the time
- Chests Spawn 75% of the time
- Wood farming buffed 50%
    - Wood stacks give 50 mats
- Brick farming buffed 25%
    - Brick stacks give 40 mats
- Metal farming buffed 10%
    - Metal stacks give 30 mats
- Ammo pickup buffed 50%
- Chests and Floor Loot never drop Grenade Launchers or Rocket Launchers
- Supply Drops spawn in missing 1hp making them visible to all players and never drop Mini-Guns, Desert Eagles, or Semi-automatic Sniper Rifles

These settings would allow players to spend less time looting and farming enabling them to get into more fights. 

Supply drops only dropping the best weapons would make them a higher priority forcing players to fight over them more often for the reward. Rocket launchers and grenade launchers only come in supply drops. 

Storm
- The 1st storm circle is shown on the map from the beginning of the game and closes faster
- There are only 8 storm circles instead of 9
- Match length is 20 minutes
- The storm does only 1 tick of damage until the 3rd circle closes

This would allow players to make a more skill based decision as to where to land and help eliminate the mid-game slowness experienced in normal game modes.

Miscellaneous
- Bloom nerfed 50%
- Fall Damage nerfed 50%

Nerfing bloom would allow for more skill based outcomes in gun fights. 

Nerfing Fall damage would help reward players who are good at building over those who shoot down structures.

Scoring
- Winners of Frenzy! Mode are decided by a point system based on eliminations and placement. Players receive one point per elimination (Elim-Points). Also, an Elim-Point multiplier is given to players who place in the top 3 with additional points added after the multiplier depending on placement.

Elim-Points = 1 point per elimination
1st Place = Elim-Points x 5 + 16
2nd Place = Elim-Points x 3 + 6
3rd Place = Elim-Points x 2
4th-100th Place = Actual Placement

- Player/Team with the most points are considered the Frenzy! Mode winners regardless of initial placements.

This point system would help discourage people from camping, make for faster gameplay, reward the better players, and keep the game both skill based and fun to spectate. For example: If 1st Place only had 1 elimination, 2nd Place would have to have 6 or more eliminations to receive the Victory Royale. Tie breakers would go to whomever placed highest.


This is what I came up with when trying to think of the perfect game mode. Feedback appreciated!",FortniteCompetitive

I don't know if you're familiar with my Twitter page [@FPLnewsfeed](https://twitter.com/FPLnewsfeed) but we post up-to-date announcements on the eSports scene in Fortnite. We currently have 600 followers with many being players in the Pro Discord and StepOne Legendary League. I saw that you guys were [wanting a better alternative](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8rhqr1/we_need_an_alternative_to_keemstars_fortnite/) to KEEMSTAR's ""Friday Fortnite"" tournament and can tell you it's definitely on the way. I'm super happy to announce that the ""FPL Showdown V1"" will take place in late July. I was going to wait to announce this until the end of the month but I feel like it's best to let you guys know, after going through all the comments in that post. 

It will be V1, V2, V3, etc because much like Fortnite our page is a walking, living, breathing beta and we're working harder and harder every day to get you guys the best content in competitive Fortnite. I have 16 teams locked in and ready to play. Without giving away big, specific player names, I can tell you that **NRG**, **WBG**, **Lucid Dreams**, **Onlsaught**, **9Dmg**, **WAWA**, **CBT**, and former **Dare** members are all represented *respectfully* in this tournament. Many of the top F/A (Free Agents) have came together to team up as well. This tournament wouldn't be a thing if I weren't communicating with the pros thoroughly on seeking rules that they would want to play for. So that's exactly what happened.

Key features in V1

* Points based system:
   * We decided to go with a points based system long before we saw that post yesterday. We feel like we have come up with a constant, precise system to give players the best chance to win.
* Randomized seeding:
   * We agree with you guys in saying that some sort of seeding needs to take place in these tournaments
   * Randomized seeding is the way to go we think
* In-game prize pool:
   * We're funding this all on our own, so we feel like the best prize pool to give out is V-Bucks
   * The prize pool will be spread out evenly and the top 3 teams will get a cut of it

Key features for V2 and beyond:

* More elaborate points based system:
   * We actually came up with a more elaborate way of tracking points but it seems it's best fitted for LAN
   * We would need a personal scorer for 32 people to track this more in-depth way
* EU tournaments:
   * We know there's some absolute monsters in the EU scene and we're working on V1 for you guys
   * We are in the early stages
* LAN:
   * The end goal for this idea has always been LAN and we will take this idea to LAN very soon we believe

We're working on this idea and improving it everyday. It wouldn't be possible if it weren't the constant communication back and forth between us and the pro players. If you want to help out in any, please do not hesitate to contact us. ***A more in-depth announcement is coming later this month***. Make sure you stick around for that. ",FortniteCompetitive

The only advantage he has is the money he's throwing around for the tournament - if we can find or create an alternative to his tournaments, we would make him obsolete and at the same time further develop the competitive Fortnite scene to its full potential.

I believe the only reason boxing is not perceived as OP is that most good players choose to play agressively because it's more fun. If great players were to play competitevely they would play passive all day because boxing is the optimal way to 1v1. Boxing yourself with a roof forces a confrontation on equal ground when you started on lower ground. On top of this, the boxed player both has the initial edit advantage and the initial first shot advantage (since the person who destroys the wall has shot already). 
Now I know, the advantage is not big enough for lesser boxed players to kill better agressive players, but ultimately, boxing is the optimal and safest way to play, which is very bad for competitive fortnite.

Now I'm not quite sure how to fix this and I'm open to suggestions, the only thing I can think about (which might be very bad since I haven't thought of all the consequences) is to introduce a very small delay (like a quarter of a second) for rebuilding a wall that has just been destroyed, this gives the advantage to the attacker instead of the defender. You would still be able to protect yourself against someone spraying at you from a distance but it would require to stay mobile and build on new tiles everytime if you want your cover to  be bulletproof.",FortniteCompetitive

If so is there a percentage of each? Like 50/50 or is it random? Also are you able to fill random squads cross platform without having someone on a different platform in your party? It was so satisfying to find true no skins unlike XBOX where everyone is sweaty as hell. ,FortniteCompetitive

We often debate the PC players, but I'm looking to watch and learn from more players. 

As of right now, for me: 

PS4 - NickMercs 
https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/NICKMERCS

Not much needs to be said, you all know him. He's rapidly improving as a builder and probably has the best gun skill on console. 

PS4 - KamoLRF
https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/KamoLRF
https://www.twitch.tv/kamolrf

I checked this guy out after seeing somebody on this sub recommend watching him. He's a German Twitch streamer, so unfortunately I can't understand him, but he is a very good player. He boasts a 12 K/D and 44% win rate over 1178 games in Season 4. He's also had a 31 kill squad game, 28 kill duo game and a 24 kill solo game. 

Xbox - Gronky12
https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/GronKy12
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu2pLbxy3QNbC-kcz7crV2g

Many of you may not have heard of Gronky, but he is a very good Xbox player. He held the solo kill record at 25 (broken now), he currently holds the duo kill record at 32 and he's tied for 2nd with a 29 kill solo squad game. The guy just consistently kills 20+ people a game. He has a YouTube which I'll post, but be warned, he is pretty cocky. 

Xbox - Twitch ImPumps
https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/Im%20Pumps
https://www.twitch.tv/impumps

Tied with Gronky with a 25 kill solo game. Has a 25 kill squad best and a 22 kill duo game. He's a great player, but slightly below Gronky. I actually managed to find his Twitch because this guy terrorized me and my duo partner by himself in a build battle (he had a 16 kill game going, but we managed). 



These are the four that I watch. Looking forward to seeing more and hearing about the best console players.

\[not in order\] 

NINJA

i mean he is deffo a god,he can build well/edit/aim anything you name it. its coming from more of a TSM MYTH kinda guy but like how myth is right now its just sad i guess. ninja is hated since he is mainstream and like the most popular guy rn with fame the hate comes aswell. i cant say WHAT ninja is best in since he does everything good overall and not just 1 thing

TFUE

i never really watched alot of tfue but i can tell he is a top tier player how he edits in shotgun fights/and like how he is commin with creative ways on how to push ppl with ramp.his ghost peeking is great aswell but like the only thing i hate about him is he dosent really like the game? he just plays it since he is super good at it and getting views.  but no doubt he is a great player 

TSM\_HAM/DAEQUAN

it was hard to decide in these 2 so i just named both i guess lol daequans shot gun aim and building is CRAZY good. everyone thinks he is just good at shotguns but he is also very good at building. and hamzs is just a great ass fucking player he carried myth in the 20k tourney,he can build well and faceoff multiple enimes at once

also i really wanted to add myth here but like he just lost his touch but hopefully dada will be back",FortniteCompetitive
248,MyFateIsSealed-,1529011938,8r5lpd,25,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/8r5lpd/keybind_sprint_vs_toggle_sprint_discussion_pc/,10,Keybind Sprint vs Toggle Sprint Discussion (PC),"I am very happy this subreddit was created and I feel like topics like this finally have a great place to be discussed.

So I am having a bit of an issue. I consider myself an above average player who is looking to compete, but there is one thing about my game that has been dragging me down. Sprinting.

The general consensus is that most of the pro players hold the shift key with their pinky the entire game. I tried this and after 2 games it was cramping up. I have been running with toggle sprint for a very long time and it has its advantages and disadvantages

**Advantages:**

* No need to hold pinky on shift entire game
* Less stress on keyboard hand = more optimal keystrokes

**Disadvantages:**

* Player stops sprinting when opening doors
* Player stops sprinting when crouching
* Player stops sprinting when shooting
* Player stops sprinting when phyiscally contacting any object
* Player stops sprinting when throwing a grenade/sticky/c4

The disadvantages are just terrible. In chaotic build fights, or in a tough situation you never know if an object or action will take you out of sprint (which means you have to hit sprint again). What's even worse is sometimes you think you got taken out of sprint but you werent, so you hit sprint again and you are now walking like an idiot while trying to build fight someone. 

***Suggestions: PLEASE EPIC, ADD A DISABLE WALK FUNCTION***. Sorry for yelling, I just really wanted to get that out. That would make me the happiest player alive. Apart from things outside strict gameplay, walking seems useless 100&amp;#37; of the time (unless you are trying to sneak up on someone but you can still crouch run)

**Can somebody please tell me if there is a way to constantly be sprinting when hitting the move forward key? Something that will automatically sprint directly after all actions? Could this be solved using a secondary bind?**

(please read with open mind before applying up/downvote ),"1. Teamwork, Teamwork in squads is crucial and roles and strategy is insanely progressed compared to duos which is mainly snaking into zone for a heal fight similar to squads. Teamwork in duos is important but A LOT EASIER and a lot less skillful than controlling a squad and its positioning a coordinated squad takes exponentially more skill then duos. 2 mediocre players can go far with individual skill but in squad scrims it takes a lot more strategic movement and isnt just a ""turtle fest"" like the community thinks. 1 God tier player with 3 decent players will not perform without good chemistry. 1 god tier player can carry his way to victory with 1 bad player and is a lot less skillful. This is well said with the three legged race analogy wouldn't it be easier to run with 2 people in one bag compared to 3 people in do bags?????
2. ""Viewer friendly gameplay and the turtle meta""  \-\- as a pro reading these messages on the reddit people are posting their opnions as facts that duos will be more viewer\-friendly without any legitimate proof. 4 people in 1 area is easier to see then 2 people in 2 areas. **If people are using pro players turtling** as incentive against squad scrims, duos will and have just as much if not more turtling. also there will be even more turtling in the end game because there are more teams in the final circle ( more turtling ) if 16 are left in the final circle 8 teams are then turtling compared to 4 teams. in EX. more teams = more competitors = more turtling = more messy viewing... 
3. The ability to cheer for a team \-\- People are attached to teams and the drama/ news of swapping players that duos just can't bring with duos cheering for a team is almost completely wiped and would hurt the viewership more then helping. Why would you make fans take Hamz and Myth over Dae and Camillz when they are TSM fans in general? Orgs have already picked teams so why do you have to split them in half?
4. Why Ignore the already created and (was) flourishing squad scrim scene \-\- There was already and un\-sponsored squad professional scene and all those pros are getting orgs and sponsors because they have worked on their teamwork for months while also gaining a very high fan viewership so why destroy it just because of epic's opinion that duos will be more ""viewer friendly""?????

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

Ultimately, as a pro I am not worried because these issue will become apparent to the Viewers, Epic, and tournament providers making the focus eventually switch back to squads.

\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-

A look at some of the missing and subpar features (e.g. Advanced control settings), i.e. how to make console more competitive.","*Please let me know if this post isn't in compliance with the* r/FortniteCompetitive *rules*

# Introduction

A little while ago version 5 of the State of Development was released ([see here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/state-of-development-v5)). I got excited once I saw **Controller** at the very top of the page, shortly followed by a bit of a let down to be honest. Let me explain why...

As  a long time console shooter fan, be it FP or TP, I've had to deal with  some rather uncomfortable shooting controls over the years. Seeing the  recent development in console shooters for offering **advanced control settings**  (e.g. Overwatch, Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, etc.), I was fully  expecting to see these added to Fortnite in a timely manner. Hence, my  disappointment when the section Controller in the State of Development  focused heavily on building mechanics and improvements. Don't get me  wrong, these were well\-needed and appreciated of course!

Besides the lack of the advanced control settings, a couple of other features deserve some attention as well in my opinion; namely the current **aim assist model,** the lack of a **dedicated edit button** and some **miscellaneous** features.  

# Advanced controller settings

Currently,  the options for control setting are rather limited. There are 4 control  schemes available; Old School/Standard, Quick Builder, Combat Pro and  Builder Pro (with the last one being vastly superior in my opinion). Add  the *Custom Bindings*, that are currently in development, to the equation and we should be golden in the **control bindings** department. This leaves us with the **aim/look controls**.

At time of wrinting the following (relevant) features are available for aim setting customization

* Controller sensitivity X/Y slider
* Scoped sensitivity slider
* Aim down sight (ADS) sensitivity slider
* Aim assist (on/off)

Obviously, this is very limited. Let me list the features that should be added, and quite frankly, should be industry *standards* (Or even better, make them PS/XBOX settings. But that is another story)

* Aim assist strength slider
   * to determine how 'sticky' the aim assist is
* Aim assist window slider
   * to indicate where the aim assist kicks in around a hit box. Note: this should definitely scale well with distance!
* Aim smoothing slider
   * the amount of 'delay' for stick input to reach the actual turn rate governed by the response curve
* Dead zone (inner and outer) slider
   * to determine the 'responsiveness' of the stick movement
* Response curve creation
   * the relation between stick input and aim output
   * currently some exponential curve
   * possibly like this ([Aim response curve creator concept](https://imgur.com/a/3rTsVay))

# Aim assist model

The current aim assist model feels pretty weird in my opinion. Usually aim assist works as a window of lower sensitivity  (that 'sticky' feeling), with some slight magnetic\-like effect when tracking. However in FN, when going into ADS, there is a significant pull of the recticle towards the center of mass of an object that enables aim assist, even when standing still. This can be  heavily abused by spamming ADS around a target, resetting this pull effect constantly. This 'feature' should be removed/ reworked in my opinion. If you are interested in this subject, I'd recommend watching [Techniques for building aim assist \- Nick Weihs (2013)](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1017942/Techniques-for-Building-Aim-Assist).

# Dedicated edit button

We all know building is key to becoming a better player in Fornite and, as mentioned before, the Builder Pro control scheme helped a lot in that regard. Besides some small kinks and a couple of bugs it works like a charm. However, it has one major flaw; the lack of a dedicated edit button. Ideally, this action would be assigned to a button that doesn't require taking your thumbs off of the sticks. A few possibilities, which I ranked from worst to best (in my opinion):

* The 'equip harvesting tool' button (triangle on PS4) now requires holding triangle, freeing up a triangle push for the edit button (*worst*).
* A button combination of the triggers/ bumbers (e.g. L1\+R1 on PS4). This could potentially interfere with turbo building though (*good*).
* Remove the toggle for sprint (L3 on PS4) and make sprint automatically  (de)activate at the outer 10&amp;#37; (placeholder value) of the left stick.  This would not only free up the left stick for a dedicated edit button, but also free up space for some other action in combat mode (e.g. 'interact') (*best*). 

# 

# Miscellaneous features

Just a list of features that could really help console players and which have not been confirmed/ hinted towards (as far as I know)

* Building sensitivity X/Y (see e.g. [u/EliteEcLip5e suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8c1rq5/request_for_console_players_please_allow_building/))
* Swapping orientation build: from R3 to D\-pad right and left (two\-way) (see [u/Bentley115 suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8kfkyf/i_love_builder_pro_it_makes_console_building/))
* Swap materials/ traps: from D\-pad to R3 (see [u/Bentley115 suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8kfkyf/i_love_builder_pro_it_makes_console_building/))
* Toggle (on/off) or seperate slider for aim sensitivity  for projectile based weapons
* Toggle (on/off) to reset build orientation 
* ^(remove KB&amp;M support...)

## Conclusion

The  combination of these additional settings should ensure everyone is able  to play as (s)he prefers. No more getting your crosshair dragged all over the place in chaotic fights, no more super sticky hunting rifle  ADS, no more aim assist ADS abuse and no longer unable to make micro  adjustments.

This creates the problem for new players that are trying to get into fort. A few of my friends who have just started to play are having a hard time learning how to build and even just game mechanics and whatnot. 

The idea to use the “playground” LTM to help noobs learn this stuff will help but would not help with how to play in real game situations. 

The idea is to have a separate queue for new players that have not won a game in the regular solos mode. Once a player has won a game in the regular solos mode the noob queue will no longer be available to the player. 

Other things can be done such as adding 10+ or 50+ win queues for better players. This would make for a more exclusive  competitive LTM. 

I agree that often the best and quickest way to learn how to play is play against better players. In this case I’m not sure that is true simply considering how drastic the skill level may be. If a new player is to die every time they try to engage and hardly even have a chance to build this will not help them improve quickly. Perhaps the learning curve has to be slightly lowered in order to help extremely new players. 

Overall, I think this will help new players find more enjoyment and keep them from getting frustrated and stop playing the game. 

I have no clue how this would affect queue times but just an idea. Also sorry if something similar to this has been posted. ",FortniteCompetitive

Also its damage to structures throws people off it has a bit more punch then most enemy's expect. now ill say i wouldn't be taking it as my first weapon in a sniper fight, but it would come in second place now. i do recommend you try taking it a couple of games if nothing else its just dumb fun to use   ",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;nbsp;

First of all, **how does fall damage work in this game?:** 

Fall damage is based on velocity, which also explains why you don't take damage if you're sliding down from a mountain, as long as you don't speed up to much. This means if you hit the ground with rather high velocity even though you didn't jump down that far, you'll still take more fall damage than if you'd jump down a mountain, but could somehow slow down your velocity without hitting the ground first.

&amp;nbsp;

#Bug 1: Sliding before hitting the ground

This is a common Bounce Pad bug that has been introduced with it.

&amp;nbsp;

**Explaination:** When you slide on a surface, before hitting the ground, you will take fall damage, because the no fall damage effect has been deactivated, but you still kept your momentum.

&amp;nbsp;

**Examples:**

* [Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8pstxu/thank_you_jump_pad_for_breaking_my_fall/)

* [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8pyy33/sign_me_up_for_faze/)

* [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8pce4m/fall_damage_bug_that_has_been_in_the_game_forever/)

* [Example 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ovete/died_to_fall_damage_off_a_bounce_pad_in_a_1v1/)

* [Example 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8q5ol9/bounce_pads_esports_ready/)

and there are many more!

You can see it in every single one of them, slide before ground hit = death.

Proposed solution: Extend the duration of the fall damage immunity, after sliding has been registered, so you still have time to hit the ground without any damage or just don't let sliding break the immunity.

&amp;nbsp;

#Bug 2: The double fall damage bug

This one isn't as popular as the first one, but still happens sometimes. 

Explaination: This has to do with how fall damage works, velocity. You get fall damage a second time, because the first hit didn't stop your momentum, which caused you to get fall damage again.

Examples:

* [Example 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8l4dkl/double_fall_damage_bug_64_dmg_from_falling_off_of/)

* [Example 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8l24ui/double_fall_damage_bug_insane_50_damage_for_a_4/)

* [Example 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8i89b2/can_we_get_a_fix_for_double_fall_damage/)

* [Example 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8omoxw/double_fall_damage_bugg/)

* [Example 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8465sg/double_fall_damage/)

* [Example 6](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7ypg11/double_fall_damage_bug/

* [Example 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8ksynx/double_fall_damage/) (most likely a mixture between both bugs)

Proposed solution: A fall damage protection for a small time frame, as soon as you get fall damage would fix this, while still allowing you to get double fall damage from let's say if you jump down from two big heights. It definitely shouldn't have occured in the examples above.

&amp;nbsp;

**If this post gains any traction and someone at Epic sees this, I'd also like to report another thing:**

People with german keyboards (like me) don't have a = button, which means we can't speed up the replay system camera speed (we need to restart the game for it and change our keyboard layout in windows). A simple fix for this would be either Keybinds for the Replay system, or changed Keybinds for different Keyboard Layouts. 

More Keybinds would generally be better, because the Quick Drop button isn't keybindable either and it's layed out for qwerty keyboards.

It more accurately reflects skill. It prevents end game from being stale. Yadda yadda, blah blah blah blah. Here’s the biggest problem with fortnite being judged on kills: it’s not what the actual game is about.

If you want to play a game where kills are the decider of who wins or loses you might wanna check out Call of Duty or any other death match shooter. But fortnite is not a game about getting the most kills, it’s a game about being the last man standing. This is a Battle Royale game not a death match game. 

Having competitive fortnite being judged on kills is breaking the integrity of the game itself. It’s like having the winner of a soccer game be decided by how long each time possesses the ball or a tennis match decided by which player hits the most backhands. That’s not what the game is about. The game is about surviving, doesn’t matter how you get there. Sure kills might be the most effective way to get there *right now* but it’s not the only way. 

No I don’t even think kills should be used as a tie breaker either. Because once again kills are not a direct indication of success in this game.

Epic employees are not lazy game designers, and I’m sure they won’t be lazy esports designers. And having kills be a primary indicator of success is lazy competitive design.

Hey all,

I've been thinking about how you can setup a thriving esport in a game that has so much RNG. If you look at every other successful esports (CS, DOTA, Starcraft) they are in games where the only real variable is the player skill and strategy. Really what we want to see is a fair, aggressive team vs. team battle, where winning comes down to the other sides strategy, aim, and building. To do this, you need to remove all the RNG of landing in a place with no one else, getting lucky circles and loot, whether you run into 10 teams on the way to victory or one. Here's how I'd do it (it's long but give it a shot):

  
**EXPLANATION OF HOW IT WOULD WORK:**

Pro matches would be one team vs. one team, 4v4.

* To start, each team places a small circle on the map to select their ""battlefield"" (the equivalent of a map in CSGO/starcraft):

https://i.redd.it/mfuht6l7x7311.jpg

* The team that chose the battlefield then chooses a starting position somewhere on the edge of the circle they places, and a starting position for the opponent is automatically places opposite that position:  


https://i.redd.it/i6tilsrhx7311.jpg

* These choices for circles \+ starting locations become the ""maps"" for the game. Teams will play \~3 rounds (whatever ends up making sense time\-wise) against each other from each starting position, then swap starting locations (essentially a half\-time). If a team wins both team\-selected ""maps"", the game goes to a 3rd ""map"" that perhaps is fixed by Epic each season, chosen to be relatively neutral. They play the third map and if that to is a tie repeat the map in ""overtime rounds"" until one side wins.
   * There is no battle bus. Players start as a group on the ground in their starting location.
   * There is no loot on the map, but materials are there and can be farmed as normal.
* **SPENDING/GEARING UP PHASE:** Each player starts with a fixed amount of materials. Before each round begins, they get a chance to spend those materials on whatever weapons, shields, and other items they want (which have prices according to their power/rarity). So you could choose to keep most your mats and go with a light load out of double blue shotgun, blue AR, full shields and a few mini's, or spend everything and get a gold scar, gold grenade launcher, and jump pad. But it's always a trade off, the more loot you spend the less mats you're going to start with, etc. Rarer items like gold ARs, grenade launchers, jump pads, etc. cost metal, while more common items (mini's, green/blue items, etc.) cost wood/brick.
* There is no loot on the map, but materials are there and can be farmed as normal.
* The storm circle would contract in a 100&amp;#37; predictable pattern towards the center of the chosen circle, so players know where they are going to have to end up.

So that's the format, effectively you get a completely fair 4v4 battle between top players, where they aren't turtling/hiding because there's only one other team to kill so there's no real advantage to trying to stay out of a fight.

There's a ton of strategy nuance, there's strategies where you don't spend too many of your starting materials and buy one jump pad for the team and rush your opponent hoping they spent all their materials on great gear and have to farm, or you choose between splodes and decent ARs, you have to balance how much you spend on heals vs. weapons, how much on variety of weapons vs. lots of ammo, etc..

It completely removes the RNG from the game and makes it 100&amp;#37; skill based, but in a way that reflects what would happen if two really talented teams ran into each other in a normal game of Fortnite and all they cared about was killing each other vs. winning the game.

You'd also get a ton of variety, some teams would choose crazy circles where one team starts on top of a mountain and other team starts at the bottom, where winning 1 round as the team at the bottom of the hill is tough and their strategy must completely change, while other team will choose really wooded areas to fight in and others will choose completely open fields with very few mats.

After finding a decent team mate I decided to dip in and start playing the most kills format on mlg. Then starting on the solo ladder when my partner wasn't on. 

It has completely killed playing a normal solo or squad for me. I no longer care if I get a victory royal. There's no incentive to win.

Has anybody else been put in this situation or is this just a me thing? Haha

But we don’t need to do this, they are already very aware of the turtling meta and a lot of recent changes have been made to address this.

Most notably I’m talking about the buffs to suppressive fire weapons (like the lmg and minigun) and c4. Also the removal on damage falloff to structures. These are all in an effort to make late game build fights less stale by letting destroy structures more easily. But these are changes they have to make in very small steps because any slight over correction can lead to a certain weapon being completely overpowered. And with each of the recent patches, epic has said they are very closely monitoring the changes, showing that balancing this aspect of the game is at the top of their priority list.

I’m not saying it’s bad to have continued discussion on this, but I do think it’s bad to have continued complaints about it, since it gets us nowhere and only spreads negativity.

3. Introduce new grenade that forces movement, such as a gold “storm grenade” that does whatever the current storms damage is up to the third storm (max 5 dmg per sec) stack 1 max like chug and shape/ size of old smoke grenades

4. Introduce an incendiary grenade that will burn all buildings connected, 1-2 tick damage damage per second on players, will stick to the players for 5 seconds or until shot(similar to boogie bomb) and will burn additionally built structures until affect is over

5. Similar to pubg add the red zone/ air bombing in 4th/5th circles only. People will have to position closer which may result in more fights.. 

6. Freeze the zone at the second to last zone eventually someone will have to push

People abuse this so much on console to the point it is nearly impossible to win for me now, I would consider myself an above average player against console players with a controller, but when an asshole who wants to abuse the system comes along I am inferior in everything I do, shooting, building and even movement are all nothing compared to competent people with a keyboard and mouse.

I think this greatly damages the competitive state of console as there is an uneven playing field, Epic either need to disable keyboard and mouse on console or add the option to search for games without kbnm users.

Whilst I understand that there will be people that say “if you want to be competitive buy a PC and play there”, I understand where you are coming from however I do not believe that I should have to buy a new gaming system for hundreds, possibly thousands of dollars to be able to compete with Kbnm users.

However, aggressiveness can be encouraged by adding Kill incentives. Obviously getting a win is very important, but we want to see exciting, high kill action. 

What if the game worked under a points system, where each kill is worth one point, with an additional 2 points being added for every 5 kills as a team.

But not abandoning the nature of battle royale, having a good placing grants you a win multiplier. 


1st place would grant you a 2.0x multiplier, meaning if your team got 11 kills total you would receive:

11 points for kills

4 points for kill milestones

And the 2.0x multiplier would leave you with a total of 30 points


2nd place would grant you a 1.75x multiplier (rounding down if the number is uneven)

3rd place would have 1.5


Everything else would be a 1.0x multiplier

First of all, let me just say how excited I am to be having this discussing in a nice, competitive minded environment. Thank you all for helping to make our dreams into a reality, we have such high hopes for the competitive future!  
  
Enough of that, let's get to it.   
### Floors in 1x1's  
Why are we building these?      
-They use more mats  
-They slow down 1x1 vertical speed  
-They can cause you to take more damage (If being gunned down from ramp direction, when floor falls and then ramp, if there's a floor you'll fall to it and be fully exposed to gunfire, if there wasn't a floor you'd fall to the floor below and be safe)  
-They bring no benefit defensively  
  
Excited to hear everyone's opinions!  From my watching, many people build floors in their 1x1's but it seems like a waste for multiple reasons with no benefit.  If it turns out you need one for some reason, you can always build it later.  I can't find a good reason to use them.

If you've been around the discord server, you've noticed LFG as a hot topic of debate.  While we did not initially roll out an LFG system, we do have a detailed plan in place.  
  
___  
  
&gt; https://strawpoll.com/kbrpzxr3    
  
In the above poll, you'll see three options. Here is a brief overview of our plans for each, if the competitive community decides so.     
___
  
### LFG  
Looking For Group - Channels for recruitment as well as voice channels for in-game communication.     
___
  
### Snipes  
Snipes - The current best option for competitive Fortnite where players attempt to join the same game by pressing play together - allowing multiple skilled players to play against each other.  These will be made irrelevant with the release of custom games by Epic Soon^tm  
If the community does decide on snipes, we would make sure every platform and region were correctly represented!   
___
  
### Rankings  
Rankings - while waiting for Epic to implement ranked, we would have a pseudo-MMR system where users may input their name and receive an approximate skill level based on a combination of wins and kills for use in LFG/bragging rights.

* 100 wins - Emote

The last 2 days we received two patches that were quite significant knowing we rarely get balance changes in the bi-weekly updates. They definitely are not the biggest, but they provoked a little bit of discussion in /r/FortniteBR.

I'll be talking more about the 6/5 patch because it's the one that shows more clearly why Epic is aiming at the wrong direction and why it might be a problem in the future.

In this patch, floor materials were adjusted to be less frequent and also the amount they held by a 33%. Also, they nerfed llamas so they don't have such an impact for those who find one early game.

Porcentually speaking, it might sound like a lot, but in practice they are not as drastic changes as people think they are. Having 10 less materials per stack is no more than 2 pickaxe hits and statistically, the chances of finding a llama are incredibly low.

Now, numbers are what not worry me at all, but it is how Epic showed unintentionally what they think is the problem.

We've seen in the last couple of months how building has evolved and how important of an aspect it is for the game, but this also mean that material usage also growth on par with it. At release, having 200 materials was enough to build a couple of walls to cover yourself, but now we know that 200 materials is nothing if you want to survive or being agile around the map.

The problem is that Epic instead of enforcing the building skills people have developed, they are **trying to nerf it** by reducing the amount of materials people collect. They've done it in the past by nerfing trees (pines and those swamp like trees) and now once again with this patch.

This is nonsense. Maybe if the changes had been added before everyone got good at building, they wouldn't be as harsh as they are right now, or they might be later on if they keep with the mentality that less materials means more balance.

A good example that comes to mind of what Epic is trying to do is like trying to tone down the damage of a weapon, let's say of shotguns, by reducing the amount of shells you find. One thing does not relate to the other.

I simply don't want Epic to gut those who invested a lot of time mastering their skills by limiting the amount of building pieces they can place just so more people have a chance. Instead, balance resources stats while also increasing the amount of gathered materials, so everyone can build a lot, but wood, the most effective resource, isn't as efficient as it is right now, whilst brick and metal **are just replacements when you run out of wood**.

Every weapon/item in the game is in a static location, only exception being supply drops. Example, that gold AR spawns at the same location at Trump Tower 100% of the time in competitive play.

Sounds awkward at first until you really consider what it would mean for competitive play. Instead of the RNG aspect of a BR game mode, you create risk/reward every drop. A team now has to decide if it’s worth it to drop in a high risk area, or if they would like to drop elsewhere with far less valuable loot. 

There isn’t a reward for players who drop in severely random locations. If they want better loot they have to fight for it. 

I can’t see a major disadvantage to this idea, let me know what y’all think.

Once customs servers roll out It won't be as campy and teams will be more inclined to fight since we will be able to count points from kills as well. If anyone is familiar with H1PL or H1 scrims in general. The scoring works where kills are worth one point and your placements acts like a multiplier towards your points.

(Why try to wipe a team when chances are they will eventually run into another team which will wipe one team guaranteed anyway)


So we have two issues here: Solely basing the scoring on kills as it has been suggested multiple times before will cause the games to feel very lopsided as it's solely a game of who can find more opponents without getting pinched themselves. The main meta here would be to catch off as many rotations as possible which can be very one-sided for teams that just aren't fortunate enough to find enough teams. By the time they reach top 10-5 their deficit will be too big even if they kill all the remaining players in the lobby.


If you change the final placement to just give a flat bonus to their overall kill count it will either be too overpowered, where people still just camp with 0 kills just to get a high rank, or will cause people to brainlessly chase kills while the goal to win the game becomes a secondary priority.




With the proposed model it would mean teams are actively encouraged to take smart fights that will net them kills - but staying alive is still a very strong priority in order to get the most out of the kills they have acquired.

Scaling it entirely linearly would be unhealthy as it would discourage early dropping out of the bus since the chance of getting wiped as #25 will be a lot higher than if you dropped later, potentially costing you a multiplier tier.


A rough proposition would look like this:

    #1:      x2.0
    #2:      x1.7
    #3:      x1.6
    #4:      x1.5
    #5:      x1.4
    #6:      x1.4
    #7:      x1.3
    #8:      x1.3
    #9:      x1.3
    #15-#10: x1.2
    #20-#15: x1.1
    #25-#20: x1.0


Now of course nobody can tell for sure what values would be the overall best, but with this you can easily adjust it until there is a healthy balance between aggression and playing it smart.


Furthermore this will make dropping in named locations more lucrative as you can quickly acquire a substantial buffer of kills early on, allowing you to play more defensively in the later stages of the game. In return the teams that landed in safer locations are incentivized to be more of an aggressor which is balanced by them most likely having more materials than the defending side as they had more time to gather resources.

Add this on top of a Bo3/Bo5 format and you will get fairly interesting dynamics of teams that fall behind having to make the decision of where to drop, causing a lot more combat throughout the game.


On a sidenote changing the final storm circles to favor positions that are currently not occupied by a player would reduce a pretty massive RNG element of the game to tolerable levels I'd imagine.

I'm a pretty casual xbox player that has a couple hours to play each night that whilst I feel my building skills are pretty on point and feel like I can gain the highground a lot faster than my opponents do (build battles or staying boots to the ground). However, I feel like I struggle to taking advantage of when I'm above my opponents.

Here are my stats to get a better idea of how low caliber I am ( have a laugh at my stats from yesteday 8-P ) :- https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/xbox/Oatkins

Like, for example, I engage in a build battle and cut off my opponent and achieve the high ground, my mind goes blank into where I go next. I feel like I should build to attack my opponent rather than build to defend myself (which I feel like I do a lot). I usually look for the high angle but is this always the way to go? Should I be keeping close quarters with opponents in build battles to know exactly where they are to counter each play or should I be aiming to shoot down at them? This feels really situational but I could be wrong.

So it's no secret that the best PC players are much better than the best console players. It's almost a diff game at the top level for both platforms. That's not to say console doesn't have their fair share of gods. 

I think it would be great if Fortnite ended up having a pro scene for console players. Epic games is dishing out 100 million in prize money for eSports for the first year... That's a LOT of money especially if it all goes to PC. They stated 'we plan to be more inclusive', possibly meaning a console comp scene? 
If epic set aside 50 million for console for example ( 25/25 split between PS4/Xbox), it would be more than enough to run some big cash tournaments for console or even a league? I'm just spitballing here, but it would be cool to see a big platform given to the top tier console players and see superstars rise from the scene and make it big. I think it would be great for console viewers who could aspire to make it big too, just picture little Timmy watching his favorite console pro play for a million dollars at some event thinking to himself that it could one day be him under the spotlight. It would breed lots of fans because let's be real, fortnite wouldn't be where it's at without the console scene. There's millions and millions of console players.

I'm certainly not a pro and I don't know what its actually like to play this game, but regardless I'd like to express my thoughts on why lategame circles ending with Medkit + Campfire is problematic and a potential solution to improve from where we are now. 

Before we start, we have to categorize the various points of a FortNite match (from my perspective) so we can all be on the same page.

**The Early Game**: Basically just the place you land. Pick up any gun and try and get rid of everyone in your area to gather the loot. (so if you land Risky Reels, early game would be killing the other players in Risky)

**The Mid Game**: First and second, sometimes third circle. A few rotations. Generally a pretty open map. This is generally spent on just farming for most teams right now, pretty limited fighting - teams can often opt to not fight each other. Those who are in the circle set up connected 1x1s, those who are not rotate around the 1x1s.

**The Late Game**: Last few circles of the game. Without building most players would be within AR range of one another. Often comes down to lots of building boxes, turtling, campfires and medkits once the storm completely closes.

I've seen numerous complaints about lategame circles from professional players, with upwards of 15 players being vertically stacked in their boxes, and the team with the most campfires or medkits wins. This is unhealthy because it mostly comes down to RNG in who picked up the most campfires. But the issue in my opinion does not lie in lategame, it lies in a pretty uneventful midgame. (thus resulting in a lot of people being alive for lategame) 

An important aspect of fights in any game is incentives - *if we win this fight, what do we get out of it?* I played League of Legends for years before switching to FortNite, and teams were encouraged to leave the safety of their bases by the Baron buff, as well as Dragons placed in the middle of the map. These neutral objectives encourage and even force fights as teams with slight disadvantages want to avoid giving major advantages to opponents, while teams with slight advantages seek to gain these major advantages. In FortNite, Early Game fights are incentivized by a necessity to gain the loot of your spawn area, and Late Game fights are incentivized by a goal of claiming the win, but Mid Game has no incentive for fights. Farming mats is simply better than straight up fighting other teams. 

So how do we incentivize Mid Game fights? By adding **neutral objectives** to fight over. In my opinion, these could be achieved by significantly buffing supply drops. Heres my idea on an improved Supply Drop:

**Removing Hand Cannon, Semi-Auto Sniper, Minigun, Heavy Shotgun, Suppressed Pistol from Supply Drops**

These are weaker weapons that would never get picked up by any competitive player. (RPG, Gold Scar, Gold FAMAS, Grenade Launcher, Gold Bolt a lot more generally usable)

**Guaranteeing EITHER a Campfire or a Launchpad from a Supply Drop**

This would make lategame Campfires earned instead of just RNG, or earn improved rotations through launchpads: Allows teams to legitimately earn advantages for lategame through midgame risk taking

** Increase Material drop significantly** (maybe 150 of each material, over 30 of one random)

Make them worth contesting, you still get materials with the time you could have spent farming

**Most importantly, decrease number of Supply Drops BUT mark them on the map when they spawn**

Makes them a legitimate midgame objective rather than a ""cool nice one dropped by us"" kind of deal that they normally feel like

I'd love to hear thoughts on this idea or other solutions. Again, I'm by no means a pro, and this would probably need to be tested and tweaked, but I've always found Supply Drops pretty meaningless to contest and generally underwhelming, and could be a great avenue for encouraging teams to fight.",FortniteCompetitive

This results in the end game having often 20-30 players in a very small circle, and ends with a confusing multi-layered build battle. 

The problem is that right now, it's actually detrimental to fight in the early game. You end up using tons of mats, and so if you kill the other team, they will give you very few resources.

My solution: every player starts with a 200/200/200 material limit. This means mats are more important in the early game, and early build fights have less chance of getting out of control.

For every kill, that player's limit gets increased by 100/100/100 (up to a total of 8 kills, so 999/999/999).

This means that a team that gets a bunch of kills in the early game has a MUCH better chance of winning the build-heavy late game.

These numbers are just estimates, for example, maybe it makes more sense to start with 500/500/500 instead?",FortniteCompetitive

But on many occasions they just hold the high ground and/or spam my structures and kill me. If I try ramping up the sides they always seem to peek at just the right moment and shotgun me before i have a chance to block their shot with a wall/stair.

Heya Fortnite folks,  
 

One of our goals for Fortnite is to have a number of ways to play the game and be successful. We’ve identified some strategies that are overly dominant and we’ll be making some adjustments today. Going forward we’ll continue to monitor how we can best support that gameplay variety.  
 

Here are some of the immediate changes coming today!  
 

**Shotguns**    
For awhile we felt that Shotguns promoted healthy close quarter gameplay, however with the recent equip time changes, Shotguns are being used more often than we like. It's something we've been keeping an eye on, but broadly speaking we feel Shotguns are a little too strong in their current state. As a result, we’re making these adjustments:  

* Pump Shotgun
* Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
* Damage reduced from 90/95 to 80/85
* Tactical Shotgun
* Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0

Shotgun consistency across the board is also something we're looking into and aim to improve. We want to make it more apparent when you hit or miss a shot. In addition to that, making sure the accuracy is more consistent and improving other odd behaviors with the weapon is a top priority. We've identified a number of issues that we're currently working on solving in the near future.  
 

**Traps**    
We made a large change to traps a few weeks ago to test decreasing damage from 125 to 75. This was done in an effort to better understand the impact traps have throughout a match. The change sparked a great deal of excellent discussion about traps and we are going to lean more into improving their effectiveness. We want this to add more ways for you to be potent in combat. Here’s the change:

* Trap Damage increased from 75 to 150

**Jetpack**    
The Jetpack was introduced as a Limited Time Item. You can learn more on the goals of Limited Time Items as a concept in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8m3htw/limited_time_item_jetpack/).

We will be vaulting the Jetpack at 8am on Monday, June 11. Get in your last matches before then! We may bring back the Jetpack at a future date with some improvements and new changes.

Drop in, try ‘em out and let us know what you think of the changes!

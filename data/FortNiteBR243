First, there is a ticket system.. your team is with 50 people. If you die, you Respawn and you use one ticket from your team. So a team would start with 200 tickets. 

When you die, you wont lose any items. Everyone starts with a basic layout what you can choose in the spawn island. And if you get some kills your guns get upgraded to a better rarity. 

The first half of the match one team tries to defend their town, they keep doing that until there are no tickets anymore left from their team, or from the enemy's if the enemy's (attackers) doesnt have any tickets anymore. They Respawn in another town, and the defending team what now need to attack need to move to that town (while the storms closes to the other town ofc) 

If it becomes a tie, it will randomly choose a team for defending. And it will be the last match, where everyone just have 1 life",FortNiteBR

I have been playing since season 1, even before skins came out. I have watched this game grow and I am happy to say that I enjoy playing it, Until now. 

Epic Games is turning this game into a lucked based game rather than a skill based game, and I have all the evidence for it. They are trying to take down the biggest skill gap in the game which is building, specifically build battles and building to get the high-ground. 

1. **Reducing the health of structures** \-  Now you may think that this is not that bad, but really Epic? They did this so shooting down a wall would take less bullets and time meaning that no matter how much you build, any spray weapon will always get to you. They also did this to make it easier to shoot people down when they are trying to get the high-ground over somebody
2. **They are promoting the use of Spray weapons** \- It is really not a coincidence that Epic is introducing these new spray weapons such as the Compact SMG and the new Submachine Gun and reducing the health of building. They really don't want you to build and to shoot down people that are building. Now let me tell you how this is bad and how luck based this is. Let's take to an equal and fair environment. If you and a player are staring right at each other with a spray weapon, have the cross-hairs at the exact same place and shot at the exact same time. The person with the most luck would win. Because of bloom. It is not definite who will win because the factor that is deciding who wins is a random number generator. So in the end the luckier person will win.
3. **They are making it harder for you to gain materials** \- In Fortnite's most recent updates, they have been constantly making subtle tweaks to gaining materials. Such as:

\- Changing floor loot from 30 to 20

\- Making the small bushes and plants take more hits to destroy rather than one

\- Epic has also been talking about lowering the material count for everything you destroy.

These little subtle tweaks may not seem bad, but can't you see what's going on? They don' want you to build and gain an advantage over another player WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SKILL GAP IN THE GAME!

Fortnite needs to go back to the meta it was back in season 3, which is building. Think about it, let's just say that they are trying to take building out of this game, what would make us play this game other than playing other battle royale games such as PUBG or H1Z1? Building is a big part of this game and it is the biggest reason why me and many others fell in love with it. Building is the biggest skill gap in the game and taking it away will lead to a luck based game. 

Now I get why Epic is doing this, they want to make the game more friendly to new players and to not get them dusted by more experienced players who have spent time getting better at the game. This is smart for Business and it is benefiting them greatly now but in the long term it won't. Think about it, if this spray meta keeps going on and gets stronger would you want to play this game? Do you want a game environment where no matter how much you build, it will always get destroyed  by some sort of spray weapon leading to stop you from getting the advantage over the other player? Drop your opinions down below and tell me if I missed anything or if you disagree, I would love to start an argument and talk about the game. I also wrote this in a rush because I wanted to rant about the game right after being sprayed down trying to build. Thanks for Reading",FortNiteBR

I don't enjoy it anymore, But I love the game so much. I've invested so much time and money into this game for it to just morph into what it is. I watch streamers more than I play and they don't enjoy it much either. I watched this game go downhill since season 4 shotgun nerfs. Epic doesn't realize they are creating more issues by listening to below average players. I'm here to just address the underlying issues of the game that are making people enjoy the game less and less.  


Explosives ; These have made 1v2's, and 1v4's nearly impossible. Streamers rarely solo teams anymore because of the blast radius buff to explosions. And I'm not talking about c4, Primarily grenades, rockets, and clingers. They destroy EVERYTHING you build. There is no more controlling your mortality if someone has explosives. It's just impossible. There is NO counter to it. I understand what they did to rockets, because let's be honest. Someone holding 150 rockets in a double grenade launcher setup is pretty OP. But the radius buff defeats the whole purpose of the rocket ammo cap. It's just as detrimental to materials and building, just like getting hit with 150 rockets was. IMO, it should be how it was. 1 structure gets damaged, and maybe you could hold 20 rockets? Some sort of balance because as of now. It's game breaking to clutching out games, and rewards people FOR NOT BUILDING.  


  
SMG ; These guns, In my opinion are probably the WORST guns to become extremely viable. They shoot down walls within seconds and bullets bleed through walls now that materials are nerfed. The game changing Smg's are the Drum Gun and the P90. The drum gun wasn't as detrimental when it came out because double shotgun still existed. That being said VARIETY was still in the game. But now since Shotgun Smg is meta everyone runs one. And when I say everyone, I mean EVERYONE. It's extremely common to find and it's probably the most versatile gun to ever come into fortnite. I can't remember the last time I looted a blue Ar over a green drum gun, or a blue mp5 over a Drum gun. Heck, even P90's aren't as versatile as drum guns. They're a lot less common, do less damage, and have more fall off damage. The meta as of now is to just SPAM someone's walls until they get into no building distance and kill their opponent. Because let's be honest, everyone wants easy kills. It requires no effort and everyone has the SAME play style. Which is spamming walls to get into your 1x1 and killing you. It's gotten to a point where 80% of my deaths are just to Drum gun/Smg spams. And there's nothing I can do to counter it. A proposed solution would be to VAULT the drum gun, Keep p90's (because having 2, 50 magazine spam guns is so redundant. especially when one is better than the other) And nerf light ammo damage to structures significantly.   


  
Shotguns ; Before I get into this, I don't support double pump at all. But removing double shotgun did remove a lot of variety in the game. Season 3 Meta was perfect. You could run 1 pump that could 1 hit, with the option of running either a tac smg (strictly better) , tac shotgun, or a heavy. I personally would always run 1 shotgun, which was the pump. Fast pull out speed, high damage, and strictly punishing if I missed my shot. Shotguns used to be very consistent and required aim which is was rewarded you.. Until they nerfed them. Which I had no issue with apart from keeping the Pump's pullout animation. The animation was justified because the pump's 1 hit capability. Now it's a gun that I just look past on spawn. What we wanted was a good shotgun balance. Same pullout speed, Good damage, and pellet consistency. The double barrel shotgun is something that we DIDN'T want. Rewarding people for having bad aim, (with a base damage of 150 that means you have to barely aim at someone and kill them), and encouraging barrel stuffing. The only way to counter someone with a Double Barrel is if you have one. Which is very uncommon to obtain. We wanted shotguns to become effective, and reward you for having good aim. This just assists people that spam you, because they now have a higher chance at killing you. There is no aiming with it, It's just point in your opponents direction and shoot. No headshots needed.  


  
Before I get comments like ""learn to adapt hamlinz and daequan can do it so why can't you"". I want to state that they ARE quite literally the top 1%. And they don't seem to be enjoying the game as much as they used too. Apart from their lack of streaming hours and ending early, they have admitted it themselves. Even Ninja want's the meta to change. And let's be honest, We're all at the point of ""If my friends didn't play fortnite I wouldn't play"". It's unbearable and agonizing to die to something you can't control. There is no analyzing what you could have done differently anymore. It's just spam spam spam. I loved this game and fell in love with the concept of building to control your own mortality, using building to be as invincible as you can be. But I can barely play for 20 minutes a day now. I have no more aspirations to get better, because there isn't any point. Everyone dies to the same spam and it's unable to be countered.",FortNiteBR

Why not make challenges that actually help a player get better, edit (x) amount of structures, land x amount of headshots. things that teach people how to play the game instead of mindlessly opening chests etc.

I was an avid PUBG player back in the day. That game started to suck more and more. My friend ask me to play one match of Fortnite. Not expecting much from it, I was blown away and fell in love with this game.

This was during the last two weeks of Season 4. I bought the Pass and got to Tier 100 Level 78. I looked online which skins I would love the most and came to the following conclusion:

\- Black Knight (S2) + Power Chord (Item Shop) backbling;

\- Rust Lord (S3) + Twitch Prime Pack #1 backbling.

Now I know.. these are now impossible to get, but I've been thinking. Is it possible for me to buy someone's account, say off Ebay? And if so. How would I secure the account to be mine? How can I lock out the other person's access once I've been given the account? Can I change the e-mail address tied to the Epic Account? and can I change the two factor authentication?

NOTE: I am NOT asking to buy someone's account here on Reddit. I am just asking for instructions of what to do to secure a bought account. Also I would like to know what to be wary of? What do I have to double double double check?

This is how I see the SMG season being fixed, but obviously there has to be some other tweaks, I say they make the gun more accurate but add recoil. The most recoil should be on the SMG with the fastest fire rate and so on with the other SMGs with the ranking of recoil.

It’s sad I have no hope for editing structures as fast as pc players bc of how slow it takes to hold the edit button on any structure. I’d literally rather just tap right on the d pad and be able to edit it right away rather than having this squad comms thing come up. I already know pc players are gunna complain and say “because well, console players have aim assist.” But honestly at least pc players have hope of getting better with their aim while sadly I’m stuck here forever with slow editing.",FortNiteBR

Rare, Epic

Ammo: None

Close Range

Description and Damage: When you fire the taser, the conductive wires will shoot out and hopefully hit their target. Like shotguns, these wires have a range of 3 or 5 feet. The damage the player takes when hit with the taser will stay the same even for headshots. It only takes 25 HP away, but the purpose of the taser is not really to inflict damage. It is to stun the player so they are more vulnerable. When hit with one, like I said before 25 HP will be taken but also your screen will blur for 5 seconds, like the boogie bomb. No ammo or reloading is required for this gun, but since we don't want people just spamming their tasers instead we will make it so once the wires are fired it will take around 5 seconds for them to be reeled back into the taser to be fired again.

*Processing img 0z1cmys8l0f11...*

**Shotgun Slug**

Epic, Legendary

Ammo: Shells

Medium Range

Description and Damage: Shotgun slug is very similar to double-barrel but longer barrel to make it medium range. Reloading and firing is all the same to double-barrel. Damage is 30-55.

*Processing img l7o5xnjjl0f11...*

**Acid Gun**

Legendary

Ammo: Acid\*

Close - Medium Range

Description and Damage: The acid gun is a very powerful gun which is why it is rare to find and only comes in legendary. It has a range of 5 feet in which acid will squirt out and hit the player. The acid will have the same effect on the player as the storm does when they are being hit in order not to make it too overpowered. The gun will have three meters on the top. Two of them will just be there for decor but the bigger one will be a high-to-low measurement. The acid will last around 5 seconds before reloading. To reload you pull out the empty acid tank hooked on top and screw in another one.

*Processing img qv3sxizol0f11...*

\*For ammo for this gun Epic Games would have to create a new set of ammo called acid, and to be honest they probably won’t want to make this new thing. To make our lives easier the ammo could just look like a small chug jug but with a color filter of green with dark bubbles and a skull and crossbones warning sign on front.

**Flamethrower**

Legendary

Ammo: Gasoline\*

Close - Medium Range

Description and Damage: The flamethrower is pretty much the same exact thing as the acid gun but with fire. It reloads by pulling out the gasoline tank from under and then attaching another one, flames last for 5 secs, takes players health slowly but surely, 1 HP at a time.

*Processing img 9zqtn7jyl0f11...*

The ammo is the same deal as the acid gun. It would be gasoline ammo, like a small chug jug but with a red color filter and a flammable warning sign.

That’ll force you to stop moving which is probably why the edit button hasn’t been added already on console. This isn’t an issue for people that use scuff controllers though. They can make a button on the back of the controller work as left on the d pad. Maybe make the traps button left on the d pad, and then use X or Square as the edit button. ",FortNiteBR

When looking at data from Twitch we can see massive downward spikes in viewership and hours watched from a week into season 5 until now and it continues to drop every day. Here’s a couple of streamers for example and the Fortnite game as a whole: 

https://sullygnome.com/game/Fortnite

https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/ninja

https://socialblade.com/twitch/user/drlupo

This is mostly because the new meta isn’t fun to watch and some of the biggest streamers feel demotivated to stream because of it: 

https://mobile.twitter.com/cloakzy/status/1025083030766080000

With most of the games hype and marketing depending on streaming, it needs to be more enjoyable to watch and the game needs to be more enjoyable in general. No I am not getting bored of the game, but the meta isn’t as rewarding as it was in season 3 or even season 4. 

With two of the biggest titles being released soon, the game needs to get back on track with where it gained all of its hype and its massive growth. Building and shotguns. There is a window of opportunity these games have to split our community and could be successful with the current state of the game. 

Side note, I do realize correlation does not causation but when there are people (streamers and community members saying they will stop playing because of how boring the meta is) we can draw some conclusions from the data.",FortNiteBR

First off I play Fortnite on mobile, now some of you may be wondering why, it's basically because my channel has been based on Mobile content for a year now and I don't want to switch up!

Anyway now we are past the ""let's laugh at this mobile player"" stage I really need some serious advice about what I can do when I take a loss while I am streaming! 

I consistently get 5+ win streaks sometimes 10+ with my highest being 20 on stream with all games streamed back to back however as soon as I lose I feel demotivated and angry. This anger often costs me to end my stream leaving potential viewers discouraged to subscribe due to my temper when I take an L.

Keep in mind I am PG so I don't swear and when I feel very angry and think a swear could slip I find the best way is to just end the stream.

I'm basically asking the community how to deal for losses/ continuous losses. What things should I put in place to calm myself after a loss so I can continue and what should I do to promote a positive atmosphere while I'm streaming instead of getting angry over simple things? 

If anyone could give me any help I'd appreciate it, much love.",FortNiteBR

The skill gap between rookies and decent players is indeed a bit unbalanced. The newbie doesn’t stand a chance against a decent player and if (s)he doesn’t get wrecked right away, it’s because (s)he’s getting played with. And that makes sense because, what can a player do when (s)he can’t build (yet) and the other person is litterally untouchable thanks to decent building skills that take some time to get down?
The problem with the meta right now is that that question is being answered poorly. Thinking of the mats nerf or the double pump nerf, spraying, explosives, weapon delays etc. This is killing the fun of our beloved fortnite. 

What could a better answer to the problem be? Well I think maybe those players should not meet if they didn’t want to. I think the game needs a casual mode being added. Coming down to a casual mode (new), a semi competitive mode (standard) and an occiasional competitive mode with rewards (solo showdown). Currently, 50vs50 kind of serves the purpose of a casual mode, which is to give newer players the opportunity to learn the game (and have fun). But its not quite there yet.

What should this casual mode look like? I think the devs and some of you may have the best answer for this but I can only think of the normal BR without tracking your stats, since the normal BR is the most fun to play. 
Anyway I think it should come down to a mode that’s only attractive to the newest players of the player base. I wouldn’t like to have to play the casual mode because only pros are playing the normal mode.

I think instead of fighting over which player base needs a buff/nerf we should be focussing more on seperating them (to some degree). Giving them both the experience they want.  Because this game definitely is fun for all players. Or maybe was. 

Like to see feedback from all of you and the more the better. Don’t be negative downvoting because you don’t agree with something. Give your opinion. How do you think it should be? What would be problematic? Let’s discuss.",FortNiteBR

I know this is post number #578 complaining about ‘meta’, I know it seems like an overused term but its the best way of explaining. Every time someone expresses concern about the weapon meta, you get atleast three people saying things along the lines of “Maybe you’re just bad?”, “Just learn to ADAPT to the meta”. If we just say “Welp, i guess this is the meta now”, epic will  proceed to not attempt to balance the weapons that makes the game less skill based. I am in disbelief that people seriously think that SMG fight are nearly as skill based as shotgun fights. Finally as shotguns were perfectly balanced (no double shotty) they add this shit. Do you know why nobody complained about meta at the start of this season? Because it was decent, not perfect, but decent.

1. He called SypherPK out because of a 5 sec delay, and the whole time he was talking to him he was cussing a lot while SypherPK didn't cuss once. Like serious who raise this kid to talk? Even his dad talked to him about cussing once in his stream but he doesn't listen to his dad.
2. Hamlin beat myth 16-2 and he was so salty making excuses like he always do. It annoys me so much that his dude make constant excuses. Truth is you aint good because more pro players are now entering the scene.  
3. Making such a big deal on his V-card. At first he was very proud of it and stuff then he lost it in LA and had to make it public. I know, but he doesn't know what's private or not.
4. He always called for a reset during scrims when he doesn't get a good lobby. Even Tfue told Myth to shut his mouth.

Like in the mid/late game I can't even fight with anyone at midrange because every time you trying to shoot someone from your building - somone else gonna snipe you from the side.  


Someone would say that it takes much skill to snipe but it actually takes much luck - I was never a good sniper, but right now I kinda forced to have a Sniper Rifle and what I do is just fast flickshot somewhere close to enemy model and it hits decent amount of times and actually headshoots a lot.  


Also, I belive every noob can snipe somebody from the side or from the back, and the most rediculous part is when you runing with your 100 hp/armor  (not in a straight line + jumping) and geting headshooted from 300 meters range by a sniper rifle - then you thinking, oh the guy who sniped me must be a god, but then you see it's his first kill and the second later hes geting shit on in melee fight by another player...  


An example - yesterday I played duo with my friend, there were 2 teams left: ours and enemy team. We haven't seen anyone and was going to the center of the circle while suddenly I got headshot sniped (while going not a straight line + jumping) from a 174 meters - and then those guys rushed my mate and he 1 vs 2 them in a close fight pretty easy, it's just a joke how some low skill player can oneshot you from 174 meters away while you don't even see them...  


Right now when I play solo and, while there about 10 people left I'm not even trying to shoot anymore I'm just siting in my base and w8ting for a close range fight, since literally everyone carrys a Sniper Rifle right now, and when I'll try to shoot somebody - someone else guranteed gonna try to snipe me from the side.  


And the last part about  Sniper Rifles right now is to open mid range fight from a sniper rifle - it's kinda the thing everyone doing right now: when you see someone 20-50 meters away from you - you not trying to shoot him with your AR (because if it's a decent player he'll build up as soon as he know someone shooting at him, so you'll make at max 30-60 dmg to him), but just trying to snipe him first - it's pretty easy to do from that range and also - you'll make at minimum 100+ dmg if you hit (so you can easily rush enemy then) and if you'll make a headshoot it's instakill.

Nice joke that someone can instakill you while you not even know hes around in the game that everyone think is a ""skill based"", right?   


So, Sniper Rifles is the only weapons in game that can oneshot someone with 100 armor 100 hp and also can do that from ANY range - and right now everyone carryes one, because it's just so nice to oneshoot someone with a random snipe xD.",FortNiteBR

i was wondering whether this subreddit could give me some advice on how to get better and more efficient at building? and possibly some strats or situations and solutions that can be used in that specific situation? 

my build keybinds are:
Floor: 4
Stairs: E
Walls: Q
Roof: C
and they seem to work decently for me, as my index finger uses 4 and E and my ring finger uses Q.

Contrary to popular belief, fighting someone way above your skill level will only teach you death and how to run away from tommy spam. I'm not saying to have all noobs fight noobs, but their needs to be a shorter range of skill within a match. I already know the ""get gud"" comments will start flying in but these are the type of people Epic should ignore if they ever want to succeed in comp.

No competitive game on the market doesn't have a ranked system (CS:GO, R6: Siege, LoL, hell even Rocket League).

One guy left and the two squeakers landed at tilted along with me. We all looted up and these squeakers though they were so cool because they were try-hards and one squeaker just said that he wasn't a try-hard when he was, and the two of them just completely ignored me because they thought that I was an annoying squeaker like them (I'm actually a female teen who just has a voice on the lower side for a female so I sound like a squeaker but I'm not) and they just keep popping me in the face with heavy shotguns when ever I tried to engage (they were build battling off/ 1v1ing each other) just because I shot down their last build to make more room because I thought that they were off and done. They left after their next 1v1.

One of them is always locked behind battle pass, which makes it unavailable to those who haven't purchased battle pass that season. Most of the time the male version of the skin is locked behind the battle pass, while the female skin is later available for purchase after it has been released in the store. This can be seen with Black Knight - which was available only from battle pass, and Red Knight - which is obviously just a female version of Black Knight, but is now available for purchase in the store. It was also the case in Season 3 with the Dark Voyager, which was locked behind battle pass, while the female counterpart was later available for purchase.

Since now that Red Knight is back in store, people who haven't played in Season 2 are able to enjoy the Red Knight, while people who prefer the male version are doomed. I would love to obtain Black Knight my self, as I have only started to play at the end of Season 2. I believe all consumers should be given an option to chose if they want to buy Red Knight or Black Knight, because like I stated before, this technique only appeals to those who prefer the female version of the skin.  

P.S. I am aware that battle pass skins are said to never come back, but why do that if you have a female version of that skin available to those who prefer the female character :(

TLDR: Red Knight came back which appealed to the lovers of female skin, but people who prefer the male version (Black Knight) are pooped on.",FortNiteBR

The pump is very inconsistent , frustrating to use, and RNG-based. The suppressed pistol is bad in late game and is a less shit version of the pistol. The thermal scoped ar has very low dps and the bullet hitbox is smaller than other guns imo. The only use for it is as binoculars. C tier: tactical shotgun, scoped AR, semi- auto sniper, LMG. The tactical shotgun is a very boom or bust gun that has a lower skill floor than the pump. The scoped AR is good in duo and squad , but falls way short in solos. Semi-Auto: a shitter version of the bolt. LMG: poor man's minigun. 🅱️ tier: Burst, AR, heavy shotgun, grenade launcher, guided missile. Burst: former  A tier that has fallen off a lot. Cant compete DPS-wise with smgs or drum guns. AR: Same as burst, but didn't fall off as sharply. Heavy: the most consistent shotty available, with good burst damage and high headshot multiplier. Nade Launcher: very bad at taking people out, without great experience with the gun. Guided Missile: serves as binoculars like the Thermal, but can kill structures too. A tier: Bolt Action Sniper, minigun, Supressed SMG, normal SMG, double barreled shotgun, hunting rifle. Bolt/Hunting rifle: the premier snipers, whichever one is better is down to personal preference. Minigun: best structure breaker In the game, but with shocking DPS. Supreesed/normal SMG: similar guns, with the supressed having more range and the normal has more raw DPS. Double barreled: too early to tell but could have a strong argument for S tier.

I'm no pro; I only have a 1.05 KD this season and 0.86 KD overall (last time I checked). I'm hot garbage when it comes to consistency, I've improved over time but I have my trash games and great games.

However, it doesn't mean I'm not aware of what's not good for the meta. You can't play anything besides Shotty-SMG, Pistols are useless, and building is trash at the moment.

I'm first going to speak on what I think is good for the meta right now and what is bad about these situations simultaneously:

I like the fact that wood has been weakened to show itself as the most common but weakest material. It makes sense that way. It means that stone and metal have more of a purpose besides being backup mats, and have become better for rushing. However, harvesting is problematic in this case as stone and metal are much harder to acquire than wood and as a result harvesting those materials (mostly metal, stone is fine) should net a bit more material.

I like the fact that there's a large selection of weapons available for players to use, but they're fairly unbalanced in terms of viability and dominance in the meta. Shotguns are in a very odd spot right now (still staples but are almost useless against SMG spam), but they're all fairly balanced except for the Pump right now. (Pump needs that swap delay removed) The Drum Gun should be removed entirely in my opinion (it's my favorite weapon, but it's WAY too versatile. It deals close and long range damage efficiently and breaks down structures in a heartbeat.), as it makes the LMG almost obsolete. Although many think the LMG should just be vaulted, that's not the solution. The Drum Gun is the problem and is what should be taken out, leaving other SMGs to perform in their niches.

Pistols are also in a bad spot; they need to decrease bloom on the standard ones and do a lot of work with the Revolver and Deagle - maybe give the projectiles drop off but lower the damage drop off? I want these weapons to be pistols, not mini snipers, but hitting far shots with these guns should be rewarded with more than 30 damage. It's disappointing. Dualies are in a fine state.

In terms of building, Epic needs to understand that if this game wants any good competitive scene, they need to make building more prominent. It's a core component and their constant nerfs to it aren't healthy, especially when you consider that the current spam meta worsens the issue. SMG damage to structures needs to be decreased considerably, as the current meta shouldn't revolve around having to spam build until your opponent needs to reload. It's not healthy or skill-based whatsoever.

I know this doesn't mean much coming from an average player, but know that there are those of us that understand what is and isn't healthy for the game and want to see positive change.",FortNiteBR

Structures
We feel building is a tad too strong in its current state, so we’ve made some changes. 

We’ve vaulted the following materials

-Brick

-Metal

We felt these types of materials were too strong and gave the opponent too hard of a task when fighting against structures built brick and metal. 

Shotguns

-We have adjusted some things with the shotguns in this balance update. 

-Pump Shotgun has been vaulted. 

-We have removed headshot multipliers on all other shotguns and lowered their damage by 30%. 

We feel these changes will improve CQC going forward. 

SMGs 

We felt SMGs were a bit underpowered in their current state, so we have increased the crit multiplier to 3.5x. This rewards skillful gameplay to those who press M1 or hold down the trigger button. 

We will continue to listen to your feedback here at Epic Games and will monitor the community’s comments. ",FortNiteBR

Appreciate that the Mac community probably isn't that big, but nonetheless we are paying customers, and it's a massive slap in the face for Epic to not even acknowledge the fact that it's actually unplayable on Mac at the moment. 

Most Mac users have to go through a 10 minute load screen on their first game (which I don't even mind that much because it fixes ALOT of the lag issues from previous seasons in every game after), but now the very next game the whole client crashes and you have to go through the whole cycle again. 

10 minutes dropping at the end of a bus run is enough for you to die to the storm, meaning every time you loaded your first game you're more than likely going to die - meaning you actually CANNOT play the game. 

the mouse issue on PS4 was addressed and dealt with swiftly. we don't even get an acknowledgement that we cant play at all FFS.

* Bring back the double pump like end S4 to compete with f\*cking spam smg meta

The new pump is pretty good to fix this BUT you often only get it in end-game.

* Bring back the old music, including the old music on Victory Royale ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvdHWXKqPjc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvdHWXKqPjc)) this was really great.
   * Bring back the old lobby background? Was pretty neat

Fortnite by no means is a good game although it's a shadow is what it once was. Now I'm not gonna sit here and say we need to go back today Eason 2 type stuff because that was good I feel like the moment they put the shotgun nerf in so that the pump didn't do 225 damage at a headshot was where fortnite started to go from a amazing game to now just a good game or a all around bad game to other people. First of all SHOTGUNS ARE INCONSISTENT i can headshot someone with the blue pump have the whole marker on them and still only hit like 14 damage headshot on a very close distance. This isn't just the pump shotgun though it goes for all shotguns it's gotten to the point where you basically have to be lucky with the shots you hit. Anyways moving on dual wield pistols is next on my list and I wanna start of by saying that they are a great weapon both epic and legendary form and they honestly were a perfectly balanced weapon but then fortnite had to make them even more inaccurate like they weren't already before. Ninja has commented on this and so has myth and many other streamers including myself. The dual wield went from perfectly balanced to ""I won't even pick it up"". Now let's talk about mats... WTF WAS FORTNITE THINKING MAKING STUFF LIKE BEDS HAVE MORE HEALTH BUT JOT GIVING YOU MORE MATS TO COMPENSATE LIKE CMONNN!!! Finally let's talk about the spray meta. I'll be honest I have used it, my friends have used it, and I honestly do sometimes continue to use it but Everytime I do I feel sick because I can have a green suppressed and easily kill someone with a epic shotgun and it sucks because the spray meta honestly requires no skill other than you making sure your on target. I understand that not much can really be done with the minigun (as far as I can think of) but when the game gets to the point where all shotguns are inconsistent, things have more health but not as many mats, straight up ruining guns that were balanced, and making a game style which requires no skill the meta well that's when me and many other believe that the game is over with and it sucks to because what I am saying is true although fortnite may still be slowly growing in new players many players have left and is why fortnite hit its peak in active players months ago and not now (from what I've heard/read) please share this if you agreed with anything I said and thank you for reading this whole thing and also i mentioned I myself was a streamer feel free to contact me on any social media simply by looking up ""MP_MBJ""",FortNiteBR

I'm interested in seeing what places everyone avoids - and why, if possible.  


I think it might provide some insight into areas of the map that need reworking etc and would just be an interesting read anyway.  


I personally avoid Fatal Fields (I also avoided Anarchy Acres) - reason being, it's boring and unexciting. I don't see any reason to drop there etc because of this, there's no practical purpose either as Fatal isn't really busy enough and I'm trying to work on becoming a better player.  


I used to avoid Moisty Mire as well - similar reasons to above.  


At the moment, I avoid Loot Lake - I just think it's too arduous - it's like a big annoying spot right there in the middle of the map or so - it's annoying to have to cross, landing right in the middle doesn't really provide you with anything of benefit - there's not enough loot to warrant the name.. I don't know, I just don't like the area and avoid it as much as possible.  


I used to avoid Dusty Divot but I've been really enjoying it this season, great changes there imo - it's like a whole portion of the map is now ""open"" to me as something I can enjoy.  


I'm not really after places you don't drop - I understand people don't drop on the outskirts of the map a lot etc out of principle, and there's people who won't drop in the middle for the same reason, regardless of locations - I mean places you just don't want to go to for whatever reason, boring, frustrating, too slow, etc etc.

So I decided to create this quick guide to maybe help some people who had the same problem as I did. Specially for those gamingon laptops. This won't work for everyone. But for those who do, it will make a huge difference.

If you ever start your game and all looks fine, but then, all of sudden, FPS start dropping and everything goes to shit, then this might help.

(This actually would help in ANY game. But since it's Fornite I'm playing, here I am.)

So, the thing is your laptop/desktop might be suffering from **thermal throttling.**

That happens when your CPU/GPU reaches a certain temperature (usually around 100°) and automatically starts throttling. Meaning: it will downclock and suck pretty bad.

You can find your CPU temps searching ""model name tjunction max temperature"" or something like that.

(Why they call max temperature tjunnction I have no idea. But anyway...)

That's where you might be getting FPS's drops and stuttering.

So all those guides telling you to INCREASE CPU power might actually be making things worse.

To find out if you have this, download MSI Afterburner or any other tool used for monitoring/over/downclocking and check if your CPU is getting too hot... and at that point your core speed drops down.

If that's happening, then you might be suffering from thermal throttling.

To fix that, you have some options:

1. Consider changing your CPU thermal paste
2. Buy a cooling pad for your laptop (5 fans underneat really helped)
3. Change your power plan to High Performance and set **minimum** processing speed on AC (inside the Advanced Power Setting) to 5% and **maximum** to 95%. We will control its speed with Throttle Stop.
4. Use a custom fan software to increase your fan's speed BEFORE it heats up (I use MacFansControl 'cause I'm on Bootcamp on a Mac). This helps because after you reach that temp, it will start throttling and it will take longer to get back to the normal state
5. Use [Throttle Stop ](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-throttlestop/)(TS) to (1) **under volt** your CPU and/or (2) limit your CPU usage. I only did the second because Apple f\* locks the ability to change the voltage on their CPU. Otherwise I'd first do that since you can have your CPU running at the same speed just using less power (yes, it will still work well).
6. Use [MSI Afterburner](https://www.msi.com/page/afterburner) (or any other monitoring tool like [HWinFo](https://www.hwinfo.com/), [RealTemp](https://www.techpowerup.com/realtemp/), [Intel Extreme Tuning Utility](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/24075/Intel-Extreme-Tuning-Utility-Intel-XTU-), etc.) to monitor and log your clock speed and temp (CPU and GPU).

Now, under volting is pretty safe to do. You're just sending LESS power to the CPU. And yes, your CPU will still work just fine even with less voltage. They are totally NOT optimized for certain tasks like gaming.

OVER volting and OVER clocking is where you can get into trouble. But if you are suffering from heat, then that's the last thing you want to do: increase power and consequently the heat.

BTW, I did NOT overclock anything. Neither CPU nor GPU. Cause, again, my problem was too much heat. So I don't want to increase anything. The best way is to reduce a lot, just to get to a safe temp, then slowly increase power again 'till you get the performance you want without going overboard.

The process to under volt your CPU using TS is pretty simple and there's a good guide [here](https://www.notebookcheck.net/How-to-Lower-Temperatures-Stop-Throttling-and-Increase-Battery-Life-The-ThrottleStop-Guide-2017.213140.0.html) and [here](http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/the-throttlestop-guide.531329/).

Just play around and reduce bit by bit and see how your CPU performs. If you go too low, your PC might freeze. But usually a restart will solve the problem.

Another thing you can do is to LIMIT your CPU. There's different ways to do it depending on your CPU, so I can't explain it all. The one which worked for me the best was setting SpeedShift to 0 in the main window, and then setting the max range inside the TLP Screen to about half of its possible range (check screenshots).

(This app works great, but it was clearly made by an engineer lol. Not the most user friendly app out there. Oh well. It's still a good one and I appreciate all the effort the guy put into making this and giving away for free.)

I also disabled TurboBoost 'cause I don't want to turbo anything since it will just increase my temps.

**NOTE**: I'm no expert or anything. Just a regular guy trying to help. So please bear in mind that you are the sole responsible for anything that happens to your laptop. Although what I'm saying here is pretty safe, there's ALWAYS a risk that something might go wrong. So please always backup and have restore points just in case.

Now, with all that, you just got to play around 'till you can find a good setting for your PC. One that will (1) still give performance but (2) without getting too hot and causing Thermal Throttling.

Here are my settings for reference:

*Processing img z70oggh6nxe11...*

It's WAY better to have constant 60 FPS, then having 120 FPS... then 95... then 43... then 72... then 21... and so on.

Way way better. Trust me.

I'm including screenshots of what worked for me in case you want to try the same. But overall here's what I changed:

1. Disabled TurboBoost
2. Turned On SpeedShift and set to 0 on main screen
3. Click TLP, turn on SpeedShift there and set maximum to 20 (out of 39). This will LIMIT your CPU, which will make your laptop run cooler thus increasing stability.
4. Set my fans to go full speed right from the get go
5. Bought a cooling pad.
6. Inside the game: all settings to low, excpet view distance which is set to far. Resolutions are all the same: display resolution in windows, fortnite and 3d resolution all set to 1680x1050. FPS limited to 120 (but I noticed that if I limit to 60fps it runs a bit cooler. And since my monitor is 60hz, there would be no point on more FPS than that. But the experience overall seems smoother if I limit to 120 instead of 60.)

That's it.

If you do everything right, your final clock speed and temp should look like this:

https://i.redd.it/xqzbag4dmxe11.png

If you suffer from thermal throttling you will see that it won't look like that. It might START like that, but it will reach a certain temp and then it will go bonkers. Everything will drop dramatically.

For example, my CPUclock would actually reach 2903... then drop all the way down to 1400... and then fluctuate A LOT between 1000-2000. Just awful. Same with GPU.

If you are NOT suffering from this problem, then there's nothing I can do lol. Your stuff simply lacks power. Which is a different problem.

Let me know if you have any questions.

And if any of the techies out there spot something that I said which is not right, do let me know and I'll correct it ASAP.

Hope that helps someone as it helped me. My gaming experience got MUCH better and I even started getting more kills just because it's simply more stable.

Happy gaming!",FortNiteBR

The introduction of the double barrel was awesome great job adding in a viable shotgun. Maybe make the pump have a crosshair like the double barrel so the pump can still one shot but you actually have to be point blank.

Had to get my opinion out there.,"The problem with this game currently lies at the fault of this sub-reddit. There's a similar tread on the front page (an actual meaningful discussion to my surprise) but I just had to get my opinion out there.

The problem is most of you Reddit users actually have no clue what you're talking about when it comes to game balance. You request things to be changed not knowing the impact it has on the game. 

No offense to all but I'm willing to bet 90% of the users here are some of the daily bots you see in game. Most people here probably never played a competitive E-Sport and probably just care about what skins / cosmetics are added to the game (as evident by the front page of this sub). 

The majority of this sub-reddit is made up of the most casual players in the game. They have little to none game IQ and the fact that Epic is actually listening to these ""bots"" is baffling. It's essentially Epic shooting themselves in the foot.

I've actually stopped expressing my opinions on this sub-reddit due to the fact that legitimate complaints and issues always get down-voted whereas useless concept ideas for skins always end up on the front page (just to name an example). Seemingly unimportant threads that have nothing to do with making the game better always end up on the front page. I don't think the community understands that these cosmetics and flashy clips won't mean shit when the game is dead. The only reason why these cosmetics have any value at all is because people are actively playing the game and wanting them.

I'm sorry but if Epic turns to people who can't even play the game for advice then this game doesn't have that much time left. I mean just look at the current state of the game compared to season 1 - 3. If you can't see the issues currently in the game then you are the problem. 

Epic's past has given me enough evidence to conclude that this game will never be fixed. Just look at Paragon (Epic's other attempt at balancing / creating an E-Sport game).

Down-vote me, trash talk me, do whatever you wish but I just had to get my opinion across. I will no longer use this sub. Any meaningful discussion me and others have tried to started always gets shitted down the throat.

TL;DR - Sub - reddit is full of bots and shitters ruining the game. Epic please stop listening to them.",FortNiteBR

Thanks to the nerfing of SMG's , shotguns are increasing in popularity and are slowly becoming a more viable option for cqb.  I believe that maybe a buff in shotguns will allow them to be used more and will make fore more exiting strategies (what epic wants) . On the contrary, giving them to big a buff will enable them to dominate like they used to  , which is the whole reason that epic games nerfed them in the first place . In future posts,  I will attempt to invent new weapons that will hopefully be added to the game . In the post I will have a paragraph dedicate to the shotguns I think should be buffed .

**The Pump Shotgun**

The pump shotgun is probably the shotgun most players want to be restored to its former glory as it was a favourite of the streamer Daequan who famously invented the excellent and effective double pump strategy.  I think that the headshot multiplier should remain unchanged but the damage should be increased . With the system fortnite has where 1 shotgun pellet is equivalent to 10 damage , I think that the rare pump should do 90 damage maximum , the uncommon should deal 85 . In addition, I believe that the grey pump should be re - added and deal 80 damage .

**The Double Barrel Shotgun**

This shotgun has been added to the game very recently and I want  to increase the range because whenever I try to get within  the effective range where I don't do 49 damage on a headshot and then get tac shotgunned , instead , I get killed by an SMG trying to give the gun a chance . So to make it more bearable , the weapon should have an 11.5 metre radius to full damage if all pellets hit . Also, damage bodyshot damage should become 75 for the legendary and 74 for the epic. 

**The Tactical Shotgun** 

This gun has a special softspot, epecialy when I find a rare one. I think that to buff the tactical shotgun , the spred should be increased  to  12 pellets so that the shotgun can do the standard damage and potentialy deal more damage . 

**Conclusion** 

You are probably wondering why I haven't included the heavy, but that shotgun is perfect and should remain unchanged.",FortNiteBR

**Shotguns :** 

Tactical Shotgun : I feel as if this is in a good place and could go untouched. It fills it's role of being the higher fire rate weapon with less range. 

Pump Shotgun : Bring back 2.5 head shot multiplier. I weapon with a .7 fire rate should be able to one shot with a perfect shot within 1-3 tiles. If you get one shot, that's on you for being out-built and outplayed. 

Heavy Shotgun : I believe this can also stay where it's at. Good range, good base damage, and a slightly higher fire rate still makes it an option to take over the Pump Shotgun, a 194 head shot is still very powerful, and with a faster follow up shot you still have a choice between all of the shot guns.

Double Barrel : This weapon seems very niche, but I believe it's balanced. You need to hit a majority of your shot because the head shot multiplier is so low. Very close range, very high damage. No changes needed.

**Sub Machine Guns :**

I want to start this off by saying that as a whole the community doesn't seem to want a RNG spam fest. The solution to this is to buff the accuracy of all Sub Machine Guns and to reduce their base damage. Keeping the Time to Kill (TTK) relatively the same, but make it more about your aim, and less about luck.

Standard Sub Machine Gun : Lower the base damage to 15/16/17 from 17/18/19 and then increase the accuracy from the 35% that it's at now, down  to 15%. This weapon also shouldn't have any accuracy bonus while strafing, and only a slight penalty when jumping. This will make it a little more effective than the ""Tactical Sub Machine Gun"" before the buff to it towards the end of Season 4. 

Silenced Sub Machine Gun :Lower the base damage to 20/21/22 from 22/23/24, this weapons also has far too much damage fall off, my gun should never be hitting for 8 damage. Lower damage fall off by 50%, everything else about this gun is fine. It should be a shorter range version of an AR. That should've been it's niche role, it should never outclass the Scar at range, but it should be usable as a closer to medium range weapon and be effective. 

Drum Gun : Lower the base damage to 23-24 from 26-27, the reason this weapon has been so dominant is the 50+ damage head shots, making a player with no shield anywhere from 2-4 hits from a 9.0 fire rate weapon. Give it far more base accuracy, and decrease the spread per bullet. This gun should be effective at close range, and somewhat effective at a medium range. 

Compact SMG : Lower the base damage from 21/22  to 18/19. Bring the fire rate back to 11 instead of 10. Give the accuracy it had on release back to it with the lower base damage, and bring the magazine capacity to 40 down from 50. This weapon should be slightly more accurate than the Standard Sub Machine Gun.

**Assault Rifles :**

Standard Assault Rifle (M16) : Give us better base accuracy, and then bump the recoil up. You don't need to remove bloom entirely, but I should never be firing 30 bullets in the direction of an enemy and only having 1-3 of them hit. Even when firing at full automatic. I don't know the exact specs of how you'd accomplish this, but it needs to be done, for the sake of the game, and probably my sanity. 

Burst Rifle : Less damage fall off, slightly better base accuracy. There's no point in using the Burst Rifle if only 1/3 bullets are going to hit when shooting from more than 20 meters away.

**Overall Changes Needed  :**

* Have First Shot Accuracy (FSA) reset faster, nothing burns more than sitting still so that your gun will be accurate to only have your head knocked off by a sniper from 200 meters away. 
* 10% more materials from farming
* Make wooden walls great again, 200 health from 150? Please? 

That's all for now, I know you're sick of seeing suggestions, but please be honest with yourselves. Has this game been fun as of late? The idea of a game is for it to be fun to play, and have it be fun to be played against. I'm not having fun being unable to build, having my materials shredded, and the current RNG spam fest. 

Thanks for reading, constructive criticism please. Don't just say ""No"" or I'll just assume that you're handicapped. ",FortNiteBR

These are definitely more effective in squads, but I'll go ahead and give my reason ing on why you all should pay more attention to them.

1. No Bloom

Easily the most clear reason why these are valuable. 100% accuracy on these guns make them super viable in medium/long range combat. A scar may have a ~20% chance to hit an opponent at range compared to a 100% chance of a scoped, assuming you take your time and hit shots. This also corresponds directly to dps. Scar has a higher dps but factoring in the inevitability of you missing half of your shots the dps lowers dramatically, and drops below that of the scoped.

2. No drop off damage

Seeing someone at range and being able to get 2/3 full damage shots in before you take a fight gives you such an advantage. Third partying people from a mountain is also unmatched with these weapons compared to any other. Not necessarily a fan of turtling end game, but if you have a scoped AR you may as well since you still have a great chance of popping off a few more kills.

3. Headshots

This corresponds with no bloom but I figured it was worth its own section because of how big of a factor the 100% accuracy. To put it simply, take your time, hit headshots, and you will do unreal damage.

4. Thermal sight

Seeing opponents through walls and predicting where they are going is pretty much a wall hack. Lining up shots before you take them has never been easier, and increases accuracy by a good amount since you don't have to swipe shot opponents down range. This is especially helpful when preparing for a sniper to peak over a ramp.

5. Squad Support

In a 4v4 its very likely the opposing squad will focus the teammate who is the closest to them. Having a scoped AR and sottong back waiting for heads to poke up will allow you to support your teammates really well.

6. Now the disadvantages of the weapons

Getting too focused on a target allows you to get sniped rather easily by a third party. Make sure you block off your sides and don't stay scoped in for too long. Thermal is much less effective in solos as it is on squads because it requires you to put too much focus on an opponent. Use it to get a few shots off then switch qquickly. Both weapons also do low damage to structures so trying to shooy through won't be that effective. 

Most people don't like carrying these simply because they dont want to drop their AR or their sniper. Depending on my loadout I'll always drop one of the two. The scoped acts as a long range so you don't necessarily need low level snipers, and you will likely have a tommy gun which can replace the structure dps of the scar. 

Lots of people seem to struggle with these weapons on console. I'm actually a console player myself and still think pretty highly of the guns so I'll give the best advice I can on how to improve accuracy.

1. Don't entirely rely on your right stick

Especially at a long distance, using your right stick moves the reticle at a rather fast rate. If you use your left stick to align yourself for minute adjustments yoy dont have to worry about moving your reticle out of line.

2. Predict your enemy's movement to align your shots

If you can clearly see an enemy moving in a direction, place your cursor in the path you know he is going to cross. There is no point in moving your right stick to rry and follow him. Doing this is super easy woth the thermal because you can see through walls.

3. Patience

Shooting as soon as the gun resets is only going to make your more inaccurate. Wait until you kmow you will hit your shot to fire. Shooting too quickly and missing will cause a longer reset than it would to wait and extra half second to gaurentee a hit.

4. Find an ADS multiplier that is best for you

If all else fails and you still can't hit your shots then adjust your ADS multiplier. A lower multiplier is not bad because you are supposed to line up your shots before you zoom in either way. If you're really serious about it. You could adjust the multiplier to be exactly the speed of a player at medium range, you just have to do the testing yourself. Remember that of you raise your sensitivity, your ADS sens also increases, since it is a multiplier and not a set number.

TL:DR: Scoped AR and Thermal's 100% accuracy and third partying/support capabilities are unmatched by any other weapon. Just be careful of getting too focused.",FortNiteBR
343,Bigi2fly,1533747362,95nsfc,21,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/95nsfc/stop_complaining_or_quit_playing/,3,Stop Complaining or Quit Playing,"I had a conversation with my friend and I at work after reading a few post on here and this was our conclusion:

People complain too much man. These post on the Reddit thread about how the new meta ruined the game is annoying..its different for everyone and i feel like if you don't have fun anymore just don't play (lol).

I personally wasn't huge on the double pump meta and a ton of people liked it. I sucked at it. i still played and tried to play with that meta and still had fun but the game needs to constantly change. Like now there's too many explosives? Play with them, use them. Is it not as fun as your preferred meta? Sure. Get better with it. Now they are saying the spray and pray method is annoying, is it? sure but get better with it. oh you cant double ramp push? figure out a new way to build. Find a new way lol. Change your game up, there shouldn't be one constant way to play, it should be a puzzle for how to win the game.

If the game didn't change the game would get boring after a longer period time. If the double pump meta and huge build fights were still here, the game would've lost more players, and the only ones would have enjoyed the game still would've been the players that use that meta. YOU WERE GOOD AT THIS META, NOT THE GAME AS A WHOLE. Just because you are good at one aspect of the game doesn't make you a ""good"" player and doesn't mean epic is catering to the ""new"" or ""bad"" players. They simply want to change the way its played and if you can't switch your style or figure out a way to make your style work, then sadly, you're not a ""good"" player. . But I believe after awhile it would get old and think it would get boring if it one meta stayed in the game forever.

***In short: The game would get older faster if it stayed with one meta and people just practiced that meta. The change of metas offers a chance for players to develop and get better at other aspects of the game. These changes aren't Epic catering to ""bad"" players or limiting the ""skill gap"". It adds a fresh way to play and it challenges the players to figure out a new way to play. Good players will figure that out, bad players will keep blowing up this Reddit thread about how dumb Epic is. If you don't like the current meta, stop playing, don't complain because other people may love the meta you hate.***

Thanks,

sincerely an annoyed ""bad"" Fortnite player who still has fun.",FortNiteBR

These are my opinions and things that I think they should fix in FortniteBR. I'm not saying that everything in this thread should be fixed but from experiences most of the things should be fixed.

**Meta:**

The meta is really bad right now with many of people quitting the game because its a spray meta. I fully agree that this is a really, really bad meta and its basically unplayable without a Pump + Drum Gun. This meta has really put me on the edge of quitting because its almost impossible to play late game without those two. One of the things that have also put me on edge and my friends is that its just a spray meta so that noobs and good players can just spray down your buildings with a p90. This is why I loved season 4, because it actually had a skill gap and the more you played is the more you learned. Now I feel like i'm not learning anything by playing this game. I really have also been bugged by this strait up RNG Meta where when your right next to someone and its based on RNG to see who wins the fight. This game is not supposed to be based on RNG at all. 

**Bugs:**

Update 5.20 is the worst update I have probably ever played in, ever. The new shottie is pretty good but what came with this update is not. Audio bugs, Game Crashes, Lag Spikes, Ping Spikes. These are just a few things that have been going on with the new update. These new bugs have really made it impossible to play sometimes. I really don't like getting in a fight and lagging off or my game freezes during a fight and i cost my team a win or i just fall of a build fight because i got unlucky and lagged. I have pretty decent internet and during season 4 this was not a issue at all. Now i'm stuck with lagging and audio bugs. 

**What Epic Needs To Do:**

With my experience in season 5 and all of my friends as well, we all agree that SMG's need to get a nerf. I really feel like SMG's need to have almost 100% accuracy close range but they need to do a small amount of damage. I feel like SMG's need to do around 6 - 10 damage close range and they also really need to do less damage to buildings. Instead of having 1 clip destroy a entire 1x1 they should make it to where 1 clip can do half of that. Drum Guns really need to do a lot less damage as well but keep the same recoil (maybe less recoil). Epic needs to do a good job on portion control and keep the shotties be a part of the meta as well. I really liked what season 4 had to offer with shotties so I think they should bring back double pump and make the pumps do 5 - 10 more damage. If they do this we could have a very interesting early game with SMG's being good but also having the opportunity to double pump. Epic really needs to make it where whatever is the most OP in the meta, they should just nerf it instead of making other guns better. Epic really also should do playtests when it comes to making a new update. If they would spend more time testing the game then making more cosmetics we would have almost no glitches and have a pretty good meta. At this point it really feels like Epic is using this as a way to make millions instead of having a good game that is actually fun to play.

**Overview:** 

In my opinion they should nerf SMG's and make pumps better. They also have to fix all of the bugs in the game and spend more time actually making the game good instead of making it a billion dollar industry. It's really feeling like they are just playing 1 or 2 games and just saying, yeah this is good and releases it and then it turns bad. And if Epic wants to keep adding cosmetics they really need to make them good instead of just recycling them over and over. 

Thanks for reading everyone. Please leave your own opinions on what epic should do for this game to be better for the community. Epic really needs to see this. 

Thanks -

He plays solos throughout his whole stream all day 99% of the time, other than that he plays like 1 hour of duos like once a week. He uses his custom server once 1 week for about an hour for his followers but its hard to get in cuz server cap is 100 obv, so people might have to wait weeks to get to play with him. He has this opportunity to host games wich everyone wish they had but rarely uses them. He was invited to the summer skirmish but placed really badly (110) and even has his own esportds team, Team Samsung with other hungarians, so you know he likes competitve fortnite.

A lot of people couldnt play, but it was his foirst tourney so he didnt know this. He knew that 5 times more people wanted to play than what got the play. 

Fast forward to today they use the same website again. and again it fills up instantly. Only 70 people teams were able to signup leaving another 500+ teams unable to signup sign alot of people wanted to signup it was hard to get in, and the toornament page had issues. The organisers accepted to wrong teams and we had to wait another hour to know who got signed up. Some people who get signup the first time were told they they werent 1 hour later, how would that feel? So basically people who werent  accepted at the start got accepted later and people who got accepted at the start didnt get accepted

Worst part is 95% of the people playing have &lt;1.5KD, and they want to show this tournament on national television. 

Than people started saying in ther discord that they knew that they needed more spots because of the last tourney had held. Some people were banned from the discord. They removed teams manually who got up in the morning to register just so they can invite more of their partners.

So I told ruben that he had more time to do tourneys, to oreganize if he didnt play solos allday. Then he told me to tell him my IGN as he ""might have a spot in the tourney for me"". I am not 10 like his viewers that I knew he wanted it for something else or just banther so i just said ""haha"". After that he said in discord ""i was just joking, i needed it so I can get you an EpicGames Fortnite ban for 3 days and banned from 3 more of his tourneys"", after that he started telling the discord that ""I am talking to him as if he was my mom and that I should fuck off"", then he said that he came on discord to listen to us, what was the problem and than he said that he doesnt even have anything to do with this tournament ( he is hosting the servers, casting the games, partners with the organizers). Than some guy asked to organizer who were the people who got invited and he replied that he doesnt even know who were the specials who were invited to this tournament. 

In my opinion hosting like this and acting like this both from Ruben and his partner are unacceptable from a professional point of view, and its said that if I had given him mu IGN he would have gone to Epic to get me banned from the game for voicing my opinion/concern with the others aswell, even though all of this has been voiced one month ago the last tournament.

People like this have access to custom servers while there are professionally set up discords for pros with no servers and they have to snipe eachothers game to practice when Ruben plays on Pubs all day. I taught custom servers were given to people to play with the community and apparently  playing 1 hour a week (mostly just specing) is enough.

I know that playground is a mode where you can group up with your squad and build cool stuff hence the name. But it's a good practice ground aswell, but what is the point of practicing in this 
 kind of mode and meta when all people do is spam splodes and smgs at you until you are inevitably dead?

Why couldn't we have this in pre- season 1 to season 2 when people really had no idea how to build a 1x1. Now everybody has that choice of hoppin on and just learning the most important aspect of the game which is getting constantly nerfed and less effective. Every new player has a choice now to learn every aspect of the game. If it is how healing items work,mechanics of weapons, building and so on. When we did not have a choice back in season 1. But now it seems like you want to favour the less skilled players against people that had to learn everything the hard way by putting countless hours into your game and most likely spending over 50 bucks on it. I really do not like this meta, cause it just makes no point in even farming mats when you know you will get them spammed.

Growing up, I remember it being a huge deal when games started adding ""build your own character"" features to sports games, fighting games, FPS; you name it. I can remember everyone freaking out when Tony Hawk's Underground featured the ability to scan and upload your face into the game.

Since I started playing Fortnite, I've never seen such a widespread desire to not only select but purchase skins that are far from similar to the player: males playing as female characters, white gamers playing as black characters, streamers with bright red hair playing as nicely-dressed office ladies, and everything in between.

It's nice to see this, because back in the couch co-op days before the internet, your friends might mercelessly bust your balls for choosing a female character, or a pink one – or maybe you would do it on purpose as a joke to troll them. Now, it's not even questioned.

Is it possible that this is indicative of a shift in our society as a whole? Do we owe it to things like online gaming, or have external factors influenced the gaming community?

But what were we complaining about in season 2? It was one-tap double pumps. That stayed in the game for a while and Ninja himself swore at the pump. Now shotguns are a lot more balanced. Then building was the problem, so Epic responded (within 6 weeks) with explosives and less building health. (I know y'all don't like it, but it was a fix, and it isn't that big a deal imo. Then again, I have 0 wins and 0.4kd so correct me) 

We are lucky to have game developers who are in close touch with the community, regularly comment on our posts, and give WEEKLY CONTENT UPDATES AND HOT FIXES. TF2, to name one example, doesn't get any new content or balancing update in MONTHS. Other games are plagued with developers who practically live in the cave near Fatal Fields, allowing their game to possess meta-breaking loadouts or characters for months at a time. So be grateful Epic is active and has a big ear to lend.  

It is only a matter of time before SMGs are put in their place again. In the meantime, continue playing normally, stop whining and be grateful SMGs hadn't been meta for 5 months instead of weeks.  ",FortNiteBR

I’m not sure if people are tactically playing differently, however, it seems lots of people seem to land central early.

My squad likes the land towards the edge and move in with the storm for easy wins, however the gameplay seems so much slower compared to the traditional game mode. 

Even first drop pleasant had 2 enemies, first drop fatal...nobody. 

Summary: It might be an idea to decrease game time to 13 minutes or so... just to speed up gameplay as long as this can be done where you can still outrun the storm.

I think some good buffs would be increase the range. This would make it so you wouldn’t be putting your self in such a risky place every time you use it.
Increase maximum damage potential to 200 on a headshot or make the reload faster. This would make it so the gun either can 1 shot or be able to deal more dps.

After patch 5.10 I've been experiencing everything mentioned in the title (roughly the same things but if someone is googling they can find this thread easier.) 

My rig is currently:   


Intel i7-7700k 

GTX 1080ti 11GB

16GB RAM

256GB SSD (where Fortnite is installed) + 2TB HDD  


I'm making this thread because I've tried combinations of every possible fix I was able to find in the past two years. 

  
I've tried:  
\&gt;un-indexing my SSD and freeing up 100GB

  
\&gt;Messing with g-sync, vertical sync (in game and in Nvidia control panel), and adaptive free-sync. 

  
\&gt;Various resolutions, frame caps, optimizations in settings in game. 

  
\&gt;going into registry editor and increasing NDU from 2 to 4 and disabling Superfetch in case this was a memory leak

\&gt;Monitored ping, bought a 100ft ethernet cable, and ran speedtest to confirm that this was not an internet connection issue 

\&gt;Manually configuring PhysX device to CPU and GPU instead of auto select then just outright disabling it

\&gt;In 3D setttings I've tried a combination of OpenGL Rendering GPU to my GTX1080ti, setting power management to maximum performance, threaded optimization and triple buffering on. 

\&gt;Disabled replay system in Fortnite, disabled NVidia Shield and Shadowplay, disabled Windows gamebar 

\&gt;Disabled ""show notifications"" 

\&gt;Ran MalwareBytes, Avast, and Norton and found no viruses or malware 

\&gt;Verifying the game, uninstalling reinstalling, messing with download location including moving to HDD

  
\&gt;Did a clean install of Windows 10 from scratch and downloaded Fortnite

\&gt;Updated all of my drivers (GPU, CPU, Network adapter, monitor) and when that didn't work I rolled back the Nvidia Geforce drivers to older and older ones

\&gt;Sacrificed my first born to the tech gods to be granted a swift and painless release from this misery

  
\&gt;Doing minimum donations to streamers in order to ask them how they fixed their own hitching issues on high end gaming rigs (ignored or had no clue what I was talking about) 

  
\&gt;Installed my old GTX 1070 gpu 

\&gt;Overclocking and underclocking with MSI Afterburner 

  
\&gt;Different game modes and landing at different locations 

\&gt;Bought Save the World to see if it made any difference [https://plays.tv/s/LqeF9n5G\_oCT](https://plays.tv/s/LqeF9n5G_oCT) &lt;- the gameplay of that 

\&gt;Monitored CPU and GPU temperature, nothing outstandingly high

\&gt;Created a script for EmptyStandbyList in order to flush out idle memory and manually used Mem Reduct before going into game

\&gt;Uninstalled Geforce Experience 

\&gt;Uninstalled then reinstalled CPU with new high quality thermal paste  


As you can see I'm losing my god damn mind trying to fix this. I love this game to death and used to play at the highest level and it feels like I can't even be half of what I used to be due to these awful consistent frame drops I've been having. If anyone has found a fix for this PLEASE send it my way and I'll test it out immediately and report back. If any more information is required I will gladly give it. I'm still waiting to hear back from Epic Games technical support after I've sent them a ticket weeks ago. I miss my favorite game in the world :( ",FortNiteBR

If you're a butthurt, ride or die for your favorite virtual video game, move on. Every. Single. Update, this game has a new bug. It's inevitable at this point, whenever a new update comes out, just expect a problem/bug. 

I'm probably gonna miss lots of bugs cause honestly there are too many to name off all. 

•Once a bug that gave nothing out of chests
•Shields in chests were invisible
•Dropping a shield from your inventory caused shield to be invisible
•Once a bug that gave nothing out of Supply Drops
•Once a bug that gave you 10x the amount of Legendary items from Supply drop 
•Invisible Wall glitch
•Edit glitch
•Build glitch
•Anyone remember the ""Use replay mode challenge?""
•Shooting through Walls glitch 
•The game breaking Xbox hitches that are still on-going
•Players shoulders covering FOV
•Countless animation problems for skins
•Cant select default bug
•Can't select back bling bug
•Couldn't build in Fatal's pond bug
•50V50s FPS problems
•Glider disappearing 
•Broken Launch Pads
•Right side peaking bug 
•Currently emoting around someone who has started an Emote, won't play your emote audio
•Shopping cart has been vaulted twice already for bugs+exploited to shit. 
•KTV Carts didn't last long till they got bugged. 
•ALL progress lost bug. 
•ALL skins lost bug
•Tire swing of doom bug. 

These are just the one's I can't remember hearing about or experiencing. None of these were Googled. I know some of these are gonna try to be justified ""gEt A bEtTEr cOnSOlE/pC bRO.""

I have zero situational awareness skills, don’t know how to remain calm under stress, and can’t seize high ground. If I somehow do, I don’t know what to do with it.

I aim like I have a horse hoof for a hand, and I’m even terrible at spraying and praying because I can’t aim. The one thing that requires no skill. I’m that garbage.

I mean, if I’ve been playing for 3 months now, I should be expecting some improvement.  But I just stopped improving. I feel like I’m getting worse at the game if anything. I’ve given up on Solos for that reason. Before you guys say I need more time, iirc Ninja got good in a month, so I have no excuse to be this bad after such a long time. I play almost every day too.

Am I just completely hopeless?",FortNiteBR

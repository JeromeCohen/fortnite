But my question is: would you consider it a rare skin? I mean, it’s a starter pack, so most people bought it, but I still feel like it holds some sort of rarity based on how long ago it was released. I don’t see many of them (probably because it’s a super underwhelming skin IMO), so it might have a tiny chance of being considered rare and not the RAREST skin in the game.

I’d love to know your thoughts. I’m not saying this skin is “OG RARE GOD TIER”, just saying it’s been like 5 months now, and that’s usually what dictates rarity (aka Red Knight; S2-S4, Powerchord; S3-5.) and it seems no ones really talking about this so.",FortNiteBR

I Believe The Cube Was Just A Tool To Bring Time Back To When The Meteor Hit. REMEMBER! The Cube Came From The Crack In The Sky, Which Connected Our World To Fortnite. But, Since The Visitor Tried To Get Home, I Think He Miss Calculated And Was Stopped From Getting The Right Frequency. He Would Have Destroyed Tilted Towers, The Place Where We Thought The Meteor Would Hit. In Season 5, The Enforcer Tried To ""Restore Order"" By Administrating The Rifts, Looking For The Visitor. Then The Cube Appeared And Rolled Around, Screwing Up The Ground In Specific Areas And Desided It Needed A Bath. Then The Floating Island Did Its Rounds. Now We Are At The Event. We Were Transported To The Inbetween. When We Left, Time Was Reversed And Reset. Now Our Island Is Threatened By An Iceburg, Where The A.I.M Bot Is From. The A.I.M Bot Also Has Ice On His Hands And Feet Proving He Is From There. The Desert Will Mostly Shrink And Restore Part Of Moistly Mire, And The Iceburg Will Hit Lucky(At This Point I Am Trying To Extend) The Visitor Will Return, Maybe After Season 7.But It Is So Confusing How Epic Has Made Their Storyline So Hard To Piece Together And Predict.

No matter how good of a builder you are, the other person can retake the high ground with just one click, and if hes got a double barrel then that is just icing on the cake. One way to nerf the grappler is to make it such that it only sticks to pre-made structures but not no player-made structures. This way it'll still have its use (To get away from a fight or to quickly jump on top of a house/cliff etc.) while the players that are annoyed by its broken use in build fights will be happy as well.

Now we ***started*** asking for them easier again (myself included) and it probably won't be until season 8. This season the battle pass felt like a really hard grind instead of where in season 4 and 3 you would level up just by playing. If you watch Timthetatmans video on Youtube, where Trevor may gets Autotune, he is even grinding challenges and takes him a little while to do each of them.

The cube's continued journey was very exciting seeing kevin move around the whole map placing runes gaining energy and that event even though it was like 2 minutes long was a spectacle to see and be apart of.

The fortnitemares event even though the zombies could be annoying at some times it was a great event, the fog the battle bus and the dark evil vibe gave fortnite a different feel.

The battle pass has been great even though i only used like 3 skins from it the pickaxes,gliders and backblings were some of the best. The music packs and pets were great additions.

This season didn't have much map changes but the changes to wailing woods were amazing i love the secret bunker and its portal.

The storyline of this season was pretty good as well the cubes journey til the cubes death now leading to the story of A.I.M and the snow storm good stuff.

The recent buff to shotguns is amazing and was a much needed update for a long time.

Most of the items they added have been alright expect for a few such as the mounted turret,dynamite and chillers.

Overall very good season",FortNiteBR

I don’t think a gun should do 150 body shot damage, especially with the mini shield meta (so most players have 50 shield) which makes lots of players 1 shot to just  a body shot. 

Hitting a body shot isn’t hard in my opinion, you can literally just do 150 damage if you hit someone’s toe. 

Also, the heavy sniper doesn’t reward headshots over body shots because going for a headshot most of the time is a risk, you could better just aim at someone’s body if he’s moving, 150 damage is probably enough to kill him, especially end game. 

The reason I still want the heavy sniper in the game is because I really like the feature of 1 shooting any sort of structure which makes it a really viable weapon. ",FortNiteBR

The drum gun, for example. This was a wonderful gun that simply needed to be nerfed. Instead, Epic removed it. For a few weeks I thought they had just removed it to make balance changes, but it is still not back.

Now, people are asking to vault the 6 shooter and mounted turret. The 6 shooter needs a buff, not to be vaulted. The mounted turret needs a nerf, not to be vaulted.

The only things that should be vaulted are things that can’t be balanced and things that are fundamentally wrong.

I can see an argument for the mounted turret being impossible to balance. It’s hard to make a stationary weapon balanced, it’s likely going to be OP or terrible. That being said, Epic should try to balance it before vaulting it. The guided missile was a similar case, it was OP and then it was a piece of garbage. Like a stationary weapon, it’s hard to balance a remote controlled weapon because it’s a low risk, high reward to use.

Ice traps are fundamentally wrong. There is no way to buff it and make it a good trap without completely reworking what the trap does. I agree with vaulting this. 

Epic has vaulted so many weapons without trying to balance them first. In the future, at the very least try adjusting the weapon before vaulting it. ",FortNiteBR

Since the hype was huge, I joined immediately. We played together almost every day. We didnt always win, but we always had a good time together. A few months pass and we meet a couple of new people to recruit into our two man army. Before there were anymore emotes than just the default dance, my friend found people who spared his life by dancing. They had a single change of heart in that moment and in turn, changed the life of all of ours. All four of us played together for the entire year since its released. We were... a literal Squad. And I couldn't have asked for a better one. But, fast forward to early November of 2018, I come home from work to see that my friend is still on and he says ""what is the nearest airport closest to you?"" I didnt know what to expect from that, but I told. That same night, he bought me and the original friend a ticket to where he lives. Next week we fly to him. It's crazy how just one invitation from an old rando in Minecraft brought us all the way here. And I couldn't be more grateful. For the plane ticket that i will have to pay him back somehow, and Epic Games' masterpiece that is the play on words of fortnight. Now, Fortnite is nowhere near my favorite game, mostly because I suck so bad at it, but I will never forget how close it brought me to having friends. It showed me how to work together with people I probably wouldn't be close friends with in real life. But, it allowed that. And it such a beautiful sight. ",FortNiteBR

264,LaLamborghiniL,1543852515,a2pw1k,36,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a2pw1k/season_2_battle_pass/,1,Season 2 Battle Pass,"When the first-ever battle pass came out, people didn't realize what they were getting into. We were all tricked into thinking we only had to play 75 - 150 hours of the game to achieve ""Black Knight"" which I call bullshit on. I was one of those people who had the game 1 month after release but didn't decide to play it until halfway through Season 2. I saw the Battle Pass as a great offer to get cheaper skins. It only took me a couple of days to realize you did not need 75 - 150 hours of gameplay. And that you only needed to play 30 mins a day for 68 days.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Math: 30 mins x 68 days = 2,040 mins / 34 hours. 

&amp;#x200B;

This answer is clearly way off the predicted time. But even if it took some bad players an extra 30 minutes, that would only equal 68 hours which is still not the clarified time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have spread my thoughts to some people about this same issue who achieved Black Knight. One guy told me that he bought it 15 days before the Season End and that he still achieved Black Knight. If we go back to math we can see that this is clearly false.

Back in Season 2, you would only get 1 Battle Star from Level 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 etc.

&amp;#x200B;

15 Days of Challenges = 150 Battle Stars

Level 1-10 = 22 Battle Stars

Level 11-20 = 23 Battle Stars

Level 21-100 = 184 Battle STars

Reaching Max Level = 229 Battle Stars

All of that equals 379 Battle Stars / 37.9 Tiers

&amp;#x200B;

That is only just over half way which proves this guy was a liar, but that 75 - 150 hours of gameplay is also a lie as reaching Max Level only gives you 22.9 Tiers.

&amp;#x200B;

And I came in 30 days before the Season Ended, which means my highest possible tiers could've only been an extra 15 tiers making it 52.9 Tiers which is still not max.

&amp;#x200B;

The last day you could've had the chance to complete it was 48 days before it ended / 20 days after it came out.

&amp;#x200B;

So my main point is, can us ""Half-OGs"" have the option to buy Season 2 Tiers if we had the Season 2 Battle Pass and did not have it before January 3rd. Even if the tiers are more expensive then the current ones. Like 300-500 vBucks a tier, I would be down so I could get Sparkle, Floss, and Axecalibur.

• If you have unlocked tier 100, you are able to upgrade Calamity and Drift even after the season ends. That includes Calamity’s pickaxe and Dire’s backbling. The same goes for Ragnarok and Drift from season 5.

• If you aren’t yet tier 100, and have all weekly challenges completed, you’ll more than likely have to purchase tiers to get to tier 100.

• If you aren’t in the late level 90s, you won’t get to level 100 realistically. From level 99 to level 100, you require over 52000 xp. It’s not realistic to ask if you can grind from level 90-100 in the last 3 days.

• Anything you’ve earned or bought this season (including vbucks) transfers to next season. 

• The season 7 battlepass will cost 950 vbucks, with a special offer of 2850 vbucks for the pass + 25 tiers.

• Completing all 10 weeks of challenges doesn’t give a special reward, but it does give you the whole season’s loading screens.

• You must complete 7 weeks of challenges this season to unlock AIM - this ability doesn’t transfer across the season.

• Season 7 is most likely to drop December 6th.

* The **Standard Pistols** come in only Common and Uncommon, an oddity for basic weapons normally available in first three rarities.
   * Bring back Rare (blue) pistol. They're currently only in Playground, from a vending machine.
   * Shift the **Suppressed Pistols** back to Epic/Legendary, like how the suppressed SCAR comes in Epic/Legendary. Improve the range of the suppressed pistols but adjust damage to 23/24. A tradeoff for suppressed pistols being much quieter.
   * Introduce a new type of pistol: **Tactical Pistol**, designed as superior counterpart to regular pistols. Available in Epic and Legendary. Damage of 26/27.
* The original **Revolvers** were vaulted as they're trash. 
   * Unvault the revolvers.
   * Give the revolvers the Deagle treatment. Increase the structure damage and increase the range before the damage drop-off. Set the minimum damage of 44/46/48.
   * May change the name and model to better distinguish from the Six Shooter.
* The **Dual Pistols** were vaulted.
   * Bring back the dual pistols, full-stop. Have them come in three rarities: Rare, Epic, and Legendary.
* Six Shooters have weird rarity availability and they tend to be trash.
   * Shift down the rarity of Six Shooter down to Common, Uncommon, and Rare without changing damage.
   * Introduce Epic and Legendary variant: Seven Shooter. They'd have damage of 40/42 and can hold 7 ammo.
   * OR: Vault the Six Shooter.",FortNiteBR

Also, why not let us add an avatar next to our names instead of just the first letter of our display name?

Seems like something that should already be there otherwise the new launcher is basically a downgrade.

This event took place yesterday in the US, but we've seen an increase in threads asking for codes/giving away codes afterwards. Feel free to provide a code in the comments directly.

### Do not:

* Ask anybody to DM you.
* Attempt to sell the codes or receive anything in return.
* Beg for a code.

This being said, this will serve as the consolidated thread for all Walmart spray codes and we will be removing other threads under a custom removal reason that directs to this thread. The goal is to make it easier on everyone to get or give away their codes.",FortNiteBR

At the moment, spamming left trigger will reset aim assist and make it so that the game is constantly locking on to a target. Add first shot accuracy and you have something that I believe is not intentional. You should only get aim assist “lock on” (having the game place your cross hair automatically on target upon pressing LT) once every 1.5 seconds so there’s no aim assist abuse, also making it so it’s not too big of a delay between having and not having lock on. This would mainly affect AR’s as they’re the ones this is most prominent with.

This wouldn’t effect aim assist “slowdown” (your sensitivity being slowed down when aiming at a player) in any way so tracking wouldn’t be effected, and you would still have the aim assist “lock on” we have already when you initially ADS.

I’m not a salty PC player either, I consider my self an above average console player having achieved 1.1k wins since I started in season 3. I just deeply feel that this is borderline an exploit. It doesn’t seem right to spam a button to abuse a game mechanic.

This is not one of those ""My friend's dad works for Epic"" or ""My dad works for Epic"" type of post. There's always that one guy that claims someone they know works for Epic and has some leaks for next season but in the end it's always fake.

A leaker from Twitter, @FBR_Fortnitee , claimed that a trusted source of him has been finding potential leaks for Season 7. His ""trusted source"" would like to remain anonymous.

Below is the things of what the leakers trusted source has claimed of what we might expect in Season 7. 

According to his trusted source, in Season 7 we might see 2 new locations added to the map. One of the skins from the Battle Pass is going to be a snowman type of skin. Another skin that may or may not be in the Season 7 Battle Pass is a ""Christmas Carol"" skin according to him. He claims that Fortnite is currently developing a player ranking system. There'll be either an Ice Queen or Ice King skin in Season 7. The main theme for Season 7 will be Christmas/Winter themed. Fortnite might NOT re-release the gifting system on Season 7, according to the ""trusted source"" they don't have current plans on releasing gifting permanently yet, but it might change. And lastly he claims that according to his source, the week 7 secret skin is not going to be a robot type skin like the previous week 7 secret skins.

He says that this isn't 100% confirmed because anything of this can change. And that anything can change because they always have other plans just in case it doesn't work or they change their mind. 



Twitter: @FBR_Fortnitee


Anyways, what do you guys think? I know that some of the things that he said might of been kind of obvious of what Fortnite could of added. And please take this with the grain of salt so some of you don't get disappointed in case something of what they said doesn't happen.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

The reason that this amount of damage is ridiculous is because even if you decide to ignore the bot that keeps swinging their pickaxe at you while you're just looking for a weapon in the early game, their (minimum of) 20 damage contribution can easily be your downfall, as players tend to be pretty fragile in the early game. I believe that 10 damage was a fair amount, since pickaxe warriors often wouldn't take the risk of trying to hit someone for a mere 10 damage, because it'd be futile. With this unnecessary, ridiculous buff, however, they will most definitely take the risk and enjoy the pleasure of annoying the heck out of their opponent in the process.",FortNiteBR

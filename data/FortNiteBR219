- Walk from one side to the other in 10 seconds

Although this drop isnt always one for high kill games, although it can be, it is one for riches beyond a no skins imagination.

Funny thing about it is that it takes no skill to use. it doesn’t. For all the people saying “you have to aim” your argument is invalid. The crosshairs take up half the screen. Can’t count the amount of times where i’m winning a fight then i push a turtle just to get 2 tapped off 200 hp. It’s not balanced at all. Season 5 is garbage. The guns aren’t balanced. I don’t know what to say anymore. And for all the kids saying “your just salty”. You only say this because you use the gun yourself and you have no skill. This is literally more overpowered than the Zapotron. Vault it. Nerf it. Lower the drop rate. The DPS on this thing is literally insane. I hope this makes it to front page. People need to see this. ,FortNiteBR

16,PodOfManyTides,1536505781,9edmuz,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9edmuz/lets_talk_about_the_double_barrel/,0,Let's talk about the double barrel.,"We've all been killed by the double barrel. A mighty weapon to behold, it is notable for its extremely high damage output (around 150 with a full body shot), giving it the highest DPS in the game. Miss two shots and you have to reload it under cover.

This weapon has the same problem people talk about with the SMG, but makes it worse. In the case of the SMG, people say, even an unskilled player can focus on you long enough to take you down. Compare this to the double barrel - if you have under 150 combined health and shield, *anybody* with a double barrel can take you out in one hit. As long as they focus on you for one instant and fire, there's little you can do besides hope they miss the next shot. The double barrel requires little skill effectively.  Other shotguns do not have this problem because, although they deal high damage, a body shot will not kill a person with full health. 

I don't think that the double barrel should be removed, but its damage should be toned down - perhaps to 80 or 90. In any case, I want a chance to hit someone before I'm one-shotted.

Do you guys think this is a problem? What do you think should be done about it?",FortNiteBR

Then they added the Drum gun. That was fine. All they could have done is slightly nerfed the Suppressed SMG and kept the Drum Gun so an Assault Rifle would have still been a good choice. Once they vaulted the Tactical SMG the first week of Season 5 and added the SMG, thats when the ""spray and pray"" meta began. And once they added the Compact SMG, or P90, then the meta began in full force. They slightly nerfed them but it was nothing because of accuracy.

The Enforcers are the ones who sent the cube. The Enforces cant live in earths atmosphere so they must change it. The cube creates small domes that mimic their planets atmosphere. At loot lake the cube will absorb water and send energy to the domes, making them grow. season 5 will end w/ loot lake drained and the domes twice as large. The trailer for season 6 will show people walking up to the cube and getting struck and bounced away. Drift walks up to the cube and when the lightning strikes him, he doesn't get knocked back ( because hes human). The Cube keeps striking him and the bolts get bigger. Drift becomes charged and the cube explodes.

&amp;#x200B;

POI

\- The wailing woods bunker opens up. The person inside decides to follow his dream: Building a chicken restaurant.

1 of the battle pass skins is the restaurants mascot. The restaurant expands into an amusement park throughout the season, replacing wailing woods.

\- Other new resturants w/ mascot skins will appear during the season. Durr burger, weary of new competition.

\- Lonely Lodge is damaged by the explosion. Its turned into a campground and tourist attraction w/ caves and a river w/ rideable canoes.

\- Loot lake is wiped out by the explosion and a black hole (its a portal to the dark side of the world) is left in the middle. During the season the Enforcers will build a futuristic city around this area.

&amp;#x200B;

CRYSTALS

i Mentioned a portal to the dark side of the world. You can go to the dark world w/ the portal or w/ the new crystals. The crystals ( parts of exploded cube) are used like hop rocks. They take you to a dark version of the world for a bit. You will be invisible to other players while there, and they will be invisible to you. you can't use weapons there.

&amp;#x200B;

SKIN THEME

\- Dark world versions of regular skins- Some previous skins from the store will have new challenges available that allow you to unlock a dark version of the skin.

\- restaurant mascots

\- camping

\- tourists

\- Futuristic

This is a post complaining about phasing and building not becoming solid. It's been happening for a few seasons since people figured out they could glitch under the map in certain areas, and in all honesty, it's a terrible solution. They should have just filled the holes under the map with the water that surround the island, meaning if you fall in it, you die. That way you don't have to worry about someone following you through your builds when they shouldn't be and they could get rid of not being able to build a solid object where someone is. It would push them one way or the other, and whatever you have built would become solid like it's supposed to.

Phasing isn't good for competitive or casual players, and it needs to be removed.",FortNiteBR

When I edited the wall, it broke and disappeared, but I couldn't place a wall in it's spot. I hit my edit key, and I was able to edit the invisible wall. [I had found the Invisible Wall Glitch again](https://youtu.be/rMEnmH0x3Q4).

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, I went into Playground to figure out how I did this, and soon found that when you edit a wall at 1 health, it will become invisible, and still have collision. [My first method](https://gyazo.com/b854a338f55a4545322d78dd0ec2611c.mp4) of doing the glitch on purpose was editing a wooden wall to the 1/3rd wall, and shoot it once with a gray AR and 3 times with a green Suppressed SMG.

Then I wondered if I could do the same thing with [brick](https://gyazo.com/e5ba6051661fe379f2168514912f4389.mp4) and [metal](https://gyazo.com/9468ec5bb4da028480bc442665599ecc.mp4). Shooting a brick wall 13 times with a green Suppressed SMG got it to 1 health, and the glitch work. On metal I used a blue Scoped AR 8 times, and the green Suppressed SMG 13 times to get it to 1 health, and the glitch worked again.

&amp;#x200B;

I had already exceeded the limitations of the first glitch, but I wanted  to see if I could go any further.  I tried the glitch on [flats](https://gyazo.com/6f0183bc787e60963111bf7d1cc2ab64.mp4), [stairs](https://gyazo.com/4e0ac0446b68fc6d743bda7fa718c0ee.mp4), and [roofs](https://gyazo.com/09b37d978003087f70474ff9660ceca3.mp4), all with success. 

 I even discovered that you could [place traps](https://gyazo.com/606a8ebba4fd984e8ac3aca84343fe05.mp4) on the invisible walls! 

 You can even do the glitch with [2 HP](https://gyazo.com/1578e4bbdf519b813524776872073870.mp4) if you edit the wall twice quickly.

While this glitch is cool, I don't think it'll serve any practical use in a real game, as its hard to find a combination of weapons to get a build down to 1 or 2 health, but it is a pretty neat trick in Playground.

I'm not posting this so people can use it for an unfair advantage, but rather to bring the glitch into the light so Epic can fix this invisible wall glitch like they fixed the old one.",FortNiteBR

I find this game really fun and sometimes a really good way to mess around with some friends. The problem I am having is simply dealing with players that are just wayyyy better then me (I wont blame op guns or mechanics, i admit i am worse then some people and i wont whine about it) with more then 1000+ wins and absurd amounts of kills, no mather how hard you try you just, wont beat them. Its like trying to fight against Tfue or some other really good player, if you are not on the same level, good luck, have fun.

If a ranked matchmaking would be added, i would be placed in a certain skill level and i would be able to play against people on the same level as me. But of course, their would be the problem of smurfing, and i have i pretty good idea on how to counter them. Lets say a smurf plays a match in the lower ranks of the system and completely dominates everyone getting around 20 kills. To prevent these players from playing in the lower ranks, after a specific amount of kills they would rank up and go to their actual skill level. So this smurf would get placed back in his rank and the real low level players would be able to play fairly against people that actually match their skill. 

I would appreciate any kind of suggestions on how to improve my idea, and i also would like to keep the disscusion civilized. Thank you for reading,",FortNiteBR

Before bugs become public and tutorials about how to abuse it are everywhere on youtube.

Ever since Season 5 rolled out my game has been extremely framy and just overall very frustrating to play because the game just randomly stutters causing random deaths. I used to be able to play this game and enjoy it with a smooth experience but ever since season 5 it's nearly unplayable. This recent update just sealed the deal and literally made it unplayable.

By Browsing the forum here i have seen a few ppl still using bad Onboard Graphic Cards, so i thought i could make someone happy by giving the Old Stuff i have away since im not really into selling that stuff.


There are 2 Pretty usless GPU's; GTX 745 /w 4gb and a AMD HD6770 /w 1GB wich i could give away aswell, but they are really old tho^^

The Main Thing i thought about is a [Palit GTX 760](https://imgur.com/a/v1Rbucx) 2GB (wont fit a Laptop &amp; Needs 2 6Pin Connectors for Power) I know its not the best GPU but defently better then really old AMD or Onboard GPU's.

So i would like to make someone that has a way worse GPU happy by giving it away (can also help you install it /w Facetime)


So i thought about letting you guys that could need it post your Rigs / Specs here so i can see how bad your current GPU is and i would probably randomly Pick a Number /w Random org from all the Comments.

Preferably someone from Germany cause the Shipping will be really Cheap for me, if its someone from pretty far away and the Shipping is really expensive i would probably have to ask you to cover the Shipping.

But i really hope i can make someone Happy that cant afford a better GPU :)

We all know there's tons of different pickaxes, or ""Harvesting Tools"" in this game. However, there isn't any Legendary ones. I think it's because, what would really separate a pickaxe between Epic and Legendary tier? So I got to thinking, and here's my thoughts.

Legendary Pickaxes would cost 1500 - same as a Legendary glider (the now standard price since Laser Chomp) and have an entirely new model, just like an Epic pickaxe. The catch is that these tools have an entirely new animation for swinging it, well not so much swinging. 

My first idea was a Spear harvesting tool, where instead of swinging, you stab and thrust it in front of you. The hitbox would still be the same, and the animation time also the same, it's just the animation itself is different. 

Then I was thinking, maybe a Sledgehammer tool, where instead of swinging it, you slam it down over your head, like you're playing the ""Hit the Bell"" game at a Carnival. 

And then a final one I thought of was a Fencing weapon. You hold it with one hand and jab with it similar to the idea of the spear.

This was just my thoughts on how Epic could maybe make Legendary axes that would be fair in price to the playerbase. It would bring a whole new unique aspect to the Harvesting tools as they all currently use the exact same swinging animation. ",FortNiteBR

Why it isn't my internet:  
1. I have a wired connection.  
2. According to speedtest, my ping is 9ms, download speed is 114Mbps and upload speed is 11 Mbps.  
3. When using Geforce Now and testing my connection to Nvidias servers, it reports an 11ms latency, 0% frameloss, and that my bandwith is greater than 50Mbps. All well within their specs.

4. Battlefield (week 9 of season 6)

Honourable mentions during this time are also Fallout 76, Tomb Raider and Assassins Creed.

This will be the most challenging season to date to keep the casual player base active, let’s be honest Fortnite isn’t going to die but a big chunk of the players could switch during this season if Epic don’t up their game.

What would you suggest they do to keep things fresh and keep the high numbers of active players? For me they need to keep up with the map changes maybe up it a little more this season every 2 weeks on the scale of Tomato Temple for example. 

They also need long term goals for us to work towards, reward wins, kills with certain weapons 0/250 AR kills for a weapon skin, 0/250 Retail kills for a cool back bling. 

Finally keep added new and interesting LTM’s, the Getaway one is very different but a lot don’t like it, close encounters is rumoured to be coming back which is good think out of the box Epic!",FortNiteBR

People complained about rocket spam, epic nerfed the rockets, and buffed the explosion radius so the weapons wouldn’t become unusable. Some people even complained about building, so that was nerfed too.


P.S. I can appreciate some people loved the old shotguns, and if you were in a situation where you could get 1 pumped,you either couldn’t build, or just chose not to.

I honestly can't blame him for wanting to switch. It seems like every patch keeps making console play worse. ",FortNiteBR

As you may know, with Seasons 4 and 5 were released hop rocks and then rifts. The question is, what will be released with season 6.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of ideas. From as trivial, as simple portal-ish things that teleport you to specific place on the map, to crazy idea of Negative-world-portals. As you could've seen on [week 10 loading screen](https://i.redd.it/it79q7kq3lk11.jpg), the Brite bomber is seeing her negative like reflection on the cube's surface. Actually, my theory is that cube lets you enter negative universe, someting like mirror of our world. So it acts like portable portal to this negative world.

&amp;#x200B;

What we could expect is maybe someting like small cubes, scattered on the map, that you could walk into and enter this negative world. You could then maybe quickly get to your desired location and re-enter our world.

Instead of fixing the current meta all you're doing is ""shockwave grenade added, blue rpg removed."" NOBODY CARES about the RPGs or shockwaves. We just want the game that we all enjoyed in October of last year. Everything was good up until the end of season 4. Laggy servers (it's not my internet), terrible frame rates, and sweats everywhere. You shoot at somebody once and they build till they're all out of max mats. I dont mind that, it's just when everybody does it and you just get sprayed down by a third party every time its just not fun. Build battles were so much fun until the spray meta. All a noob has to do to win a game is spray an smg. Theres 0 skill gap. Plus, reddit basically ruined the game. They pushed epic to remove the one shot ability of the pump. This makes it so that you have 0 chance of winning a fight if you have low hp and your opponent is full shield and hp. Then they pushed epic to remove delayed double pump. Removal of that and the tac smg created todays spray meta. Tac smg wasnt op, nor was delayed double pump. Nobody needed the regular smg, and nobody needed the compact smg. Nobody needed shockwaves or any other dumb pieces of crap they've added, either. Reddit, thanks for ruining the game. Hope your enjoying the meta while epic counts their money instead of fixing the things that need to be fixed, while they keep adding and fixing things that we didnt need at all.

Today i would like to talk about something that been frustrating me for a while.

I started playing fortnite 6 month ago and it was my friend who got me into it actually, i loved the game so much, so after a couple of days i created a Facebook Closed Group called “ Fortnite Egyptian Community “ why Egyptian ? Cause i live in egypt and i just wanted to see how many egyptians are playing the game aswell !

The little i know after 5 month exactly from the time we created the community, we reached 15k active Daily members !! No joke and i got all the proof you want!

We grew heavly fast people here in egypt loves the game they support epic and every change they do (rip double shooty).

But yeah lately i’ve heard that couple of other arabic and middle eastern communities are doing some tournaments and events on their own groups and pages, so when our members heard about custom matchmaking being played in the middle east, they immidiatly started to ask for tournaments and events for our own community, and i know some of you guys reading this probably wondering “yes okay what do you want ?” 

Let me get straight to the point i want to host custom matchs to my community and i want to support it as much as possible and yes i tried contacting epic games through epic games support ticket, and they didn’t reply at all. 

One of my friends suggested that if we can get epic’s attention on reddit then maybe we might have a chance to get our hands on one of the keys.

I know this is might seem bs to you but seriously brothers and sisters, i can’t handle anymore frustration, people are just going crazy about us hosting events and tournaments, and we have the ability to do so, we tried hosting couple of tournaments like the UMG one but they didn’t quite like it and yet they keep asking for custom matchmaking just like other communities.

Anyways i hope epic would notice us as a community and would give us a chance to satisfy the needs of our community.

Sorry if i took so much of your time, and i appreciate everyone who read this out and welling to support us.

Thank you so much and hoping for a respon from epic [proof ](https://gyazo.com/a88e3afee561acbcfe9abe978929aa3e)",FortNiteBR

Currently, there are much better options for medium ammo, such as the Thompson or most AR’s. My suggestion is that the LMG should be enabled to use its bipod that is featured prominently at the front of the barrel. Players could mount it by channeling a key for a short time (1.5 seconds) against the edge formed by the top of a wall or the base of a window frame. This would increase its accuracy and make it a much more tactically appealing weapon to use especially in squads. Thoughts?

Since that Epic have changed the rarities of guns I find it weird that they haven’t given the Drum Gun a legendary rarity considering the green Drum Gun is a much better weapon than a golden P90. 

If I’d be in charge I’d just vault the Drum Gun, that gun definitely has no place in a game like Fortnite. I’d also be okay with a nerf; smaller magazine, less damage, etc. 

What are your thoughts on this?

Anyways I'm having unplayable FPS issues with my new build -- I will be running at 140, then drop to 5fps for about 10 seconds... any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

My build: 

ASUS STRIX GTX 1080 A8G

Intel i5 8600K @ 4.3ghz

MSI Gaming Plus z370 

1x8Gb DDR4 2400Hz

550Watt PSU

1TB HDD @ 7200RPM

&amp;#x200B;

I ordered a SSD and am hoping that helps. I also ordered another 1x8 stick of RAM. I am not experiencing issues with other games, and am very frustrated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!

Ive won games due to kids falling and Ive lost due to myself falling, neither really feels good. I think its really RNG and I think end game public lobbies become way more about rotations than they really should be. Its a public lobby, not PAX West...maybe I’m not used to the change? I dont know, not complaining, just wondering how you guys feel about it. 

Also to add, I dont know why they included this feature in the end game circles...its not like people are going to hide in the gas when its doing 10 damage per second...a similar feature would be more useful earlier in the gas circles so that people dont have 40 second turtle fights in the storm that ultimately result in both players dying...if youre fighting in the storm, the fight should be sped up by either quickly deteriorating your structures or instantly breaking them forcing you to fight in the storm, basically making the storm a “No Build Zone.” But again, im just brainstorming and giving my opinion. If the feature stays long term I’ll obviously adapt over time, I just dont really see the reasoning for the change other than FPS. ",FortNiteBR

Now of course, everyone reading this is free to disagree and debate me. Starting from the very top

1. Drop the elimination aspect, make victory score based.

 \- I've had to have played well over 100 matches in all my time on this game and more often than not, I find myself spending half the match running into the ever elusive circle (which I'll talk about later) and never actually seeing any action as either the enemy or our teams dwindle into the 10s after like 2 minutes. I know I'm asking alot from a BR game, but we've all seen that Epic's willing to expand their horizons and have flirted with score based modes in the recent past. Ultimately, it just makes more sense to run it like a deathmatch than a battle royale.

2. Allow for a set amount of respawns 

\- Because this goes hand in hand with the idea of basing victory off a scoreboard I think it'd be neat. It's not impossible to implement because clearly Playground mode pulls it off just fine. Nothing crazy of course, maybe 2 or 3 lives max. Maybe even only make it possible with an item and definitely keep the storm so that we're all forced to fight. 

3. Make the circle visible before the Battle Bus(es) are halfway through their run

\- The mechanic used to be like this and I've disagreed with the change. It just makes things funner and more even in my honest opinion. We've all seen instances where we jump to an area and the circle pops in on the complete opposite side of the map.  So what should've been a few good minutes to get kitted up and ready easily turns into spending the whole game just running around. Plus how is it fair that the other team's comes in at that location to start with when it's on an edge? At least if everyone knows where to go from the start it minimizes the amount of players jumping off ""too early""

So far that's all I got that wouldn't just be LTM tier.",FortNiteBR

I watch his streams every once in a while and can’t fathom his skill level, but I can’t fathom his personality either.

I have one question.
If you play a shooter game, and then someone shoots at you, WHY ARE YOU RUNNING? I killed you and you had medkits, a chug jug, minis, 3 slurps and all the guns in the world. You were fully shielded up and you still ran. 
Hopefully someone can explain this to me.",FortNiteBR

I am someone who plays aggressively and plays for kills. There literally 3 places that are good landing spots now. Pleasant park if it’s a hot drop, Salty Springs and Paradise Palms. Maybe Polar peak too if it’s a hot drop but man the map is so lame now. What do I look like at sunny steps, Lonely lodges, or any other place. The locations left aren’t really all that fun to land at. The map being really bad alone is killing my drive to play. There’s literally almost nowhere fun to land. I really hope Season 9 really gives us a lot of new locations or just a whole new map in general. The map is currently super lame. All the good spots have been removed.",FortNiteBR

I know that I'm going to get a billion downvotes for saying that, but its true.

 I've noticed a lot less people asking for siphon recently, but noticed there are still frequent posts about increasing mats gathered, and as casual player, I'm against this, and I believe I know why Epic is as well, here are what I see those reasons being:

1. Epic made this game with building ment to be a situational cover based mechanic if you were caught out in the open. People took building too far and it unbalanced the game. If you couldn't build, you couldn't win, which was not their intent. If people insist on building, over shooting, they should be punished. The only people using a ton of mats in one fight are the guys building crazy walls and ramps around each other. So they began testing weapons and items to help balance that gap, and give people good at shooting/item usage an advantage in trying to win against people building. These came in the form of:

2. Boom boxes, port a forts, turrets, spray meta were all ment as a building counter, Epic has been obviously trying super hard for a long time to have a way for who are good at shooting and dont like building to be able to break through that gap. Remember when explosive damage went thru builds? Ask yourself why that would be a thing if only to not counter a person spam building walls? Obviously, some of these were too strong, and unbalanced the game too far in the other direction, and were subsequently removed after various periods of time. However they didn't give up, they went with an alternative method: 

3. Siphon. They tried a new system which, in theory, would give an advantage to those who favor shooting over building, providing a semblance of balance, with the added effect of providing less materials for those veteran builders, requiring more thoughtful use, further closing that gap. This however, also did not go as planned. As Epic concluded themselves, it made causal people play even less, and caused more frustration, as the siphon ended up only benefiting those in the 10%. Which gave them an idea:

4. Arena mode was put into effect, creating the casual and pro gap they intended, but they also went one step further by leaving siphon out of normal play. This ensured the two types of play were different enough that casual players would not be used as training cattles for pros, decreasing the skill gaps between players, which means more wins, and more time played by the casual player.

This is just my view point, and is in no way the consensus. Think about this though: why would most casual players vote for a weapon that melts walls like butter of planes, a jumping pad or a sword: because casual players, like me, want to shoot and kill people, not build ramps and stand on top of each other for extend periods of time. 

But hey, that's just my two cents",FortNiteBR

**Part 1: The Unvaulting**  
During the Unvaulting section of the Vaultcano event, we went into an alieny-like portal that lead to the same dimension we got teleported into upon the Cube's destruction. This time around, instead of floating around in the void, we got teleported into the Vault, and we got to ""vote"" on which of the six vaulted items we wanted back into the game. Though what people didn't tend to notice was the desk at the end, which showed a pushed out chair, the desk, a radio playing the old lobby music, and a futuristic helmet. People are theorizing that this helmet belongs to the Gatekeeper/Vaultkeeper, and that he was on break when we went into the Vault. I wish to add to this. The Unvaulting event was, in fact, a smash-and-grab robbery while the Vaultkeeper was out. With how durable the Vault's monoliths are, we only had time to smash open the Drum Gun's case before the Vaultkeeper came back and activated the security measures, lowering the other 5 monoliths and sending us back out. The runes we had to activate to open the Gateway was an automated system meant for the Vaultkeeper to do when he came back from whatever he was doing. During the Cube event, the reason we were floating through the Nexus was because the Cube's explosion was an unstable version of the Gateway's teleportation.   
But, what's that big shady orb in the distance?

**Part 2: The Vaultkeeper, Enforcer, and Season 9**  
So, the Cube sent us to the space up high in the Nexus and the Gateway teleported us to the Vault. Though, we aren't done with the Vault just yet. There's still the big, spacey orb in the middle. It has the same sparkly stuff we saw in the Nexus. I have reason to believe that this is the Vault's power source, and that the Cube is a big raw chunk of the stuff. We'll get back to this later, though.   
With the new Season 9 teaser, we got a weird robot-looking guy in a cloak with the caption ""The future is unknown."". This, combined with the Vaultkeeper's mask and the whole future thing going on leads me to believe that the Vault, Nexus, and the entire dimension within it is a dimension outside of time. The Vault is a stabilized space within the Nexus, and the weird void the Cube sent us to was the Nexus Plains, with creatures like the Rift Butterfly living in it. The Nexus itself has numerous deposits of a purple superfuel that the Nexus People use to power their technology. The Hop Rocks are what we call this superfuel and the Cube is an unstable form of it that somehow gained sentience. The Gateway and its runes are powered by the superfuel. They are not godlike beings, but rather an advanced civilization from the future looking down upon us. They take whatever items they deemed too powerful or too useless and seal them away into the Vault. The giant orb in the Vault counts as a power source, a security system (the orb began to emit huge beams and rays when we were floating back out), and a way to see into our world. Dream and Luminos are civilians from the Nexus.  
This, in turn, leads me to believe that the Visitor and Enforcer from Seasons 4 and 5 are also from the Nexus. The Enforcers are the low-ranking officers of the Nexus, the ""Time Police"". The Visitor is a civilian turned most wanted criminal of the Nexus, and had sent himself in an escape pod out of the Nexus and into our world, in the past. His pod collided with numerous space rocks, and turned into the meteor that crashed into Dusty Depot. His pod corrupted some of the rocks into Hop Rocks. Upon his break out, he scanned the island and found his ticket out and off the island: the rocket being used for the Carbide VS. Omega movie. Using his hyper advanced technology and the hop rocks, he managed to turn the prop rocket into a working rocket capable of quantum tunneling. He activated it and broke out, leaving our world, ending up somewhere, somewhen. He had to pass the Nexus first, which is how we heard the rocket sirens during our first trip into it, along with noises from his rocket. The result was a giant crack in space-time, which over the course of the rest of S4 and S5, grew then began to shrink. The Rifts, when entered, try to send you up to the Nexus, but with how unstable and small they are, they only send you up high into the sky. The Enforcers, having picked up traces of unstable space time and their own fuel being used somewhere else, go investigate the scene. They neutralize the Crack on the spot, causing it to spew out the rest of the energy left in it, forming the Cube. It is unknown how the Crack gained sentience. Maybe the Visitor died upon breaking through dimensions, and his consciousness got stored within the Crack. It immediately began attempting to destroy itself by leaving runes behind to let charge, get itself in the air via going into the water directly above the portal into the realm it came from, gaining energy from the powered up runes, and overloaded itself. The Gateway opened up, letting Loot Lake's water spiral into it. The Cube deposited its left over energy into the Vault so it wouldn't fall into our hands again, and blew itself up. The raw energy caused by this explosion accidentally transported us into the Nexus for a brief period before spewing us out.   
After the Vault incident, these beings are certainly not going to be happy with us, and will be coming to us to sort things out.  
So, case in point, the Visitor, Enforcer, Cube, Rifts, and the Vault are all from the same existing dimension. In Season 9, we'll be able to see more from the Nexus, the beings that reside in it, and hopefully visit it once more.",FortNiteBR

So when the first Season 9 trailer hit, we got a letter. ***N.***

So there are 2 possibilities.  
NOW and NEW.  
Let me explain.  


So the punchline of Season 9 is ""Future Is Now."" And the Nexus is the future (I guess.)

The teaser of Season 9 had the text ""The future is unknown."" With the letter N in the backround.  
The other 2 can be O and W. To spell out NOW according to Season 9's punchline.  


Now for possibility 2.

&amp;#x200B;

NEW makes sense because another debated punchline is ""Future Is New."" and that the NEW, the future, will come to our island. NEW is the new technology and new world that might come. Gemini is also a future-like skin, and we now know Gemini is a battle pass skin.",FortNiteBR

I think they, like many of us here, have grown tired of it. So what do they do? Well, they give us the opportunity to show ourselves exactly how smart the community is.

They added an event that allowed the \*community\* to make an immediate change to the game. Regardless of what that ""change"" was, the outcome is exactly what was expected/intended; we now have countless posts/replies mentioning said ""change"" and how to further alter it, or in some cases, even vault the ""change"".

Yes, the same ""change"" that the community made as a whole.

Maybe it's Epic's way of saying, ""see, we know what we're doing with \*our\* game, and we have this all under control."" Maybe it's to show us that perhaps what the community wants isn't always necessarily for the best. So maybe we can look at this entire event and learn from it; play the game and enjoy it.

I dont expect this to go anywhere, especially not with my first suggestion... So here we go.

1. Vault all versions of the pump and tac (Temporarily..) 

2.  Unvault the heavy, add green and blue variants. 

* Adjust damage numbers accordingly now that there are several rarities. 

3. Create a new version of the double barrel.

* It would work similarly to the double barrel we have now, but it would have a longer barrel to allow for better distance. 

* it would come in green blue purple and orange rarities. 

* damage numbers would be similar to the double barrel as they are now, slowly lower for the new rarities. 

4. If all else fails, bring back the pump, and get rid of the double barrel, keep the tac in the vault.

I am not asking for the X-4 to be unvaulted altogether. However, I feel that it would make a good addition to the Playground mode of the Royale Island. I meant to bring it up as an idea and would like some feedback, including arguments against my thoughts. But please remember to stay polite. Thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a bunch of pluses for the X-4 to be introduced as a Playground-object that I wanted to discuss and get feedback about. The X-4 is an incredibly useful tool for people who want to explore the island. The X-4 is quickly off the ground and clears great distances, which is great when people want to explore the island for changes after an update. I remember doing this a lot. 

Even if you're not all that excited about secrets, the X-4 doesn't have much of a home in Creative-Mode. The heavy restriction of the island removes a lot of the fun of flying and maneuvering. Being stuck in Creative hurts the X-4 as it feels like flopping around in a bird-cage.

Air Royale heavily reminded me about how much I loved dogfights or just being airborne on the Royale Island. You can have so much freedom and fun moving around. Being able to fight with your friends or other people on your server would be refreshing and with the stats being in their nerved state it wouldn't be much of a problem to other players. 

&amp;#x200B;

The X-4 should stay the way it was before it was removed altogether in Season 7. It was well balanced, couldn't break structures and was overall fragile/easy to shoot down. (Personal opinion, take it with a grain of salt.) That way it wouldn't bother other players. At worst, a customization for Playground servers could be in order where one could check and uncheck vehicles that they want to have present on the server. (So you can get rid of the X-4 or maybe go old-school with the ATK only. Or just Driftboards. Or nothing. No harm done.) The only big problem I see is the lack for places where an X-4 can spawn. Most of its spawning places have been replaced with Baller-sockets, and placing new spawning locations just for Playground seems silly.

&amp;#x200B;

So, would the Stormwing find a place in Playground or would you rather keep the controversial plane to Creative only? Do you agree with my opinion?",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

That is straight from the crunch article.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are taking people off the work they currently planned to do, to fix some minor issue, or remove something people 'hate', the work they were already working on, is now also going to need to enter crunch. Resulting in insane hours for the staff. They have the content flow 'planned', most seasons are planned and started MONTHS in advance. What really throws a wrench in the works, is complainers.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure, we can blame the upper management at EPIC. But the reality is, they are just doing their job. Which is, make as much money as possible, anyway possible that is legal. And also to keep public perception 'good'. Dont hate the players, hate the game(out of control capitalism). There is very little we can do about them, every industry and part corp is like this, sad but true.

&amp;#x200B;

So when someone goes and has a huge cry about item x, change y, bug z. And it gains a huge amount of traction because of reddit/twitter/streamers etc. The higher ups at EPIC, see this outcry(When in reality, is coming from a loud minority), they want to fix public perception, at any legal means.

&amp;#x200B;

This isnt some sort of 'attack' on the community, its more of a wake up call. Also content creators are more to blame, because they are god-tier at flaming the fire. Every program/game in existence, has bugs and will have new bugs in the future. Every MAJOR ISSUE, is pretty much fixed the same day, if not hour. This is pretty 'new' for video games. Even Overwatch has had major issues sitting in the game for weeks like getting under the map, that allowed people to rank up.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, new 'content', does not create bugs. This misconception is godlike on reddit, and its simply wrong. EPIC adding some new gun, isnt going to break anything else regarding the game. What can break things, is EPIC doing changes to core systems, that they do, as optimizations to make the game and server run better. Sometimes these changes, result in new bugs, but the overall goal, was to optimize everything. But a new gun/item/vehicle, is not going to magically add random bugs to other systems that are not even related.

&amp;#x200B;

 Most of the issues in the game, EPIC is well aware of, and have PLANNED to fix the issue, when it comes around. Much like the new post regarding Sound and how a lot of the big changes will not come this season. That is fine, unless we get a massive post crying about sound, and you know, they get forced it fix it fast and badly, cutting into whatever they are already working on, meaning that also goes into crunch, like i stated before. 

&amp;#x200B;

Report issues(ingame would be best), and keep enjoying the game. There doesnt need to be a new 'hate' thread regarding EPIC or a change they have made/something they did ,every week.",FortNiteBR

Additionally I can imagine that this would SUCK for shy gamers with social anxiety or just a general lack of friends. Which was also me most of my youth. I Can imagine feeling Absolutly mortified if laiter I had to admit to a peer i couldn't get the skin because I had no friends. 

As an adult the second scenario is w/e, however this game is played by millions of children worldwide and I can see very real scenarios whereby this just causes undue stress and further social issues, these things DO matter to kids.

Hello all,

We hope you all enjoy the release of Season 9, it was a blast for us to work on.   Thanks for all the Fortnite audio quality feedback in the recent 8.5 release thread, it’s much appreciated.  As always, please feel free to point out areas of audio improvement and bugs to us in the thread; we’ll be reading and investigating what the community shares and report what we’re working on.  Here’s an overview of the Season 9 audio improvements and roadmap:

**Release 9.0 Audio fixes and updates:**

* Switch audio dropout issues fixed.
* Better tactical audio when inside player-built structures:
   * Enemy Pickaxe impact within \~one building tile radius has new,  louder sound.
   * Wallbreak by enemy close/behind player much clearer/louder.
* Explosion audio improvements- shorter, higher dynamic range sounds that will make explosion audio clearer and punchier.

**Release 9.0 open audio issues:**

* Fix for PC audio device swap issues; we are planning to have this for the 9.1 release.

**What we’re working on for the upcoming season:**

* Fix for footstep sounds on the edge of structures gives audio as if you're walking on the ground. 
* Better hear the approach of enemy players outside player-built structures.
* Better audio tells for jump/landing:
   * Jump tell audio added (so bunny-hopping isn’t as noiseless).
   * Clearer landing sound detection.
* Improvements to issues of sounds dropping outside of player FOV.
* Improvement of close versus distant player gliding sounds, to help clarify distance of gliding enemies.
* Longer sounds properly playing during Replays.
* Improved differentiation of teammate verus enemy audio.
* Internal testing of binaural/HRTF solution that will be a great help to headphone players, as well as other spatialization improvements.

As a reminder, the best way to inform us of your bugs is following the below format:

* replay URL
* time code of issue
* display name of player followed via gameplay view
* description of issue

With that said, what did you want to see added back? Did you want something aside from what was given as a choice? Would you be willing to give epic the chance to balance the drum gun or do you just want it gone?

Personally i would love to see the burst come back, because personally i wasnt all that excited about the 3 main choices this time around. 

To me, the drum gun is just barely stronger then the tac because it has some range to it, but up close the tac is still just as strong, if not stronger then the drum gun. I would have been meh about the bouncers coming back because it takes away some of the danger of building too high from players, especially with how available they are, yes they can be fun, but they still have their negatives. 

Here lately epic seems to be doing decently well at balancing out their weapons, they may release something broken, but at the end of the day, they still end up trying to balance it after some data has been collected as well as player input.",FortNiteBR

* Lower the damage to 22/23

* Lower mag size to 35

* Reduce fire rate from 9 to 8/7

The drumgun is meant to act like a heavy smg so it doing 26 damage makes sense. Vault the compact doesnt make sense as we dont have that many smgs, compared with all the pistols and ars in the game.

I've seen a post on this subreddit earlier talking about Reddit not being an accurate representation of the Fortnite Community, so I've thought of something. 

There's many ways of disscusing what the community wants, whether they want Siphon back, or Drum Guns back, but there would be only one real way of testing this. What if Epic Games created two playlists, a playlist with Siphon Settings for Solos, Duos and Squads and a playlist without Siphon Settings for Solos, Duos and Squads. They put this in the game for like 7 days or maybe even 14 days, they collect the data based off that, and see what the community actually wants. I mean what they are saying is, that only 10% wanted Siphon back, but somehow they are the loudest ones. I mean, I am not saying this should only be for the Siphon, it could be for many other things but Siphon is what seems to be the main topic nowadays. I thought it would be a good idea, so let's see if this makes it anywhere.

Upvote if you're up for this idea.",FortNiteBR

1: Lava Grenade: A grenade that you can throw at someone and does 10 damage a tick. You have to be in the lava to take damage (Like a stink grenade). Only comes in a stack of 1. Epic rarity. Could be refilled by going to spots with lava in them.
Anyways those are my thought on season 9. For the theme I think a type of apocalypse. I think the storyline will be workers trying to clean up the lava until they find something in the lava (Season 4 type). By the way this was made before the first teaser so this could be totally wrong.",FortNiteBR

we have such a wide variety of weapons available yet not having a shotgun will almost always put you at a disadvantage, playing long range is rarely an option as there's plenty of mobility to close out distance between you and potentially camping opponents, and as far as I can tell most fights end with a single pump one shot, a build fight merely delays the inevitable.  
Now don't get me wrong, a shotgun being the most efficient weapon at close range is reasonable, but it shouldn't be the ONLY option. yes you can whip out your smg and start spraying and bouncing but if the enemy has decent aim you're like to get one pumped in the head and instantly one shot.  
I enjoy Fortnite, but I dislike the shotgun's dominance over every other option, I want variety and for fights to feel different because as far as my experience for the past two seasons Shotguns, especially the pump have been a necessity.",FortNiteBR

Cause it reduces the skillgap? dissapointed","Why the f would the rocketlauncher get nerfed in one way, and then buffed in another.... The idea of reducing ammo of the rocketlauncher is great, but the buff to the explosion to building is so ridiculous.... literally shooting 1 rocket and destroying walls, that are hidden behind other walls? Are you kidding me? How did anyone think, thats a good idea? I now won way to often, because I could shoot my 13 rockets, and the other person had no mats left, cause these 13 rockets can destroy 1000 wood easily... Its now even worse than before, in my opinion...

Epic should keep the rocket cap, but bring the destruction back to how it was before. So you could still shoot down a 1x1 tower, to counter camping.",FortNiteBR

Why pretend otherwise?","Since you guys already separated out Playground's matchmaker from the standard modes' matchmaker, why not at least release Playground mode as is so you can collect live data rather than test data? Even if it's broken you'll gain more in 8 hours of live data than you would in a week's worth of load testing.

At the very worst, the queue back-pressure problem will re-occur and/or the Playground server capacity will be exhausted, but only queue times for that one mode would be affected. At this point you could always just restart the Playground matchmaker servers, drop the whole current LTM queue's database and start more live tests. Even adding a simple automated script that polled average queue time and then automatically restarted the servers would temporarily get around the back-pressure problem. Combine this strategy with a warning message pop-up when they select the Playground LTM to let players know that *only this* LTM's matchmaking queue times are long and particularly unstable to mitigate any bad press resulting from the increased wait.

Not only would this give better live data for you to test and experiment with, but it would get past the initial usage spike that coincides with popular launches. Once the influx of players tried Playground a couple times, it would inevitably level off and follow more standard patterns, even if they were 100x the load of a usual game mode. This is an early access game after all and it's exactly in this phase that you're allowed to have absurd queue times and failed matchmaking -- make use of it while you can!

I know the scope and scale of this issue and the success of the game magnify the problems, but the bad PR from each subsequent delay is only making Fortnite's Reddit, Twitter, and Discord server more toxic to Epic's reputation than any long queue time or stalled matchmaker server. The entire player base and core fans that matter know you're the best game developer out there and will understand these technical issues more than they understand these delays.

Unless, of course, you've been lying this whole time and in reality Playground's matchmaker is NOT separated or was NOT the actual issue with Playgrounds in the first place? In which case wow this was some awful PR that could have been easily avoided. ",FortNiteBR

I know a lot of people have their theories but hear me out. Here are 10 reasons why there is no doubt anymore about the theme of Season 5.

1. We all know that the Fortnite characters are among the THICCest we've ever seen, why do you think there are over 125,000,000 players.
2. There has been a slow progression of people reverting to the no-skins because they are the THICCest. I followed a no-skin all over the map yesterday and it was for one reason only.
3. There are 84 male skins (not very THICC) and 64 female skins (EXTRA THICC), and the Leviathan skin (wish is was THICCer), EPIC is trying to cover themselves next season by giving us 20 THICC skins in the Battle Pass.
4. Fortnite introduced the magnifying harvester to ZOOM IN on the booty (works very well). 
5. Lucky Landing's name will be changed to 乇乂ㄒ尺卂 ㄒ卄丨匚匚
6. The visitor was NOT THICC. That's why he had to leave.
7. We have 50v50 again where potentially we could have 49 THICC players crawling around on all fours.   🤤🤤🤤If both teams all get downed with 1 player standing on either team, we can have 98- this is Epic's goal for the LTM.
8. What do you think the first T in ForTnite stands for hmmmm? (ForTHICCnite) aka. EPIC is all for-THICCness.
9. There is a HUGEEE crack in the sky. No doubt, we all know what has a crack. and it's THICC.
10. Epic leaked this information with this statement on Twitter (unconfirmed): ""We hear u guys and were giving u what u want. New season is all about THICC.""

It might be hard for some of you to accept, but for a majority of us this is the change we needed. This will really bring back all the players who have slowly lost interest. Thank you EPIC for recognizing what the community needs and giving us 10 weeks of glory.",FortNiteBR

That though should be a lifetime thing, not a seasonal thing.  It was based more around massive amounts of kills with specific weapons.  

What should be done for season 5 though should be something similar to the ""Moments of Triumph"" for Destiny.  Give everyone 15 truly difficult challenges and 60-70 days to complete them.  If you can complete 10 of the 15 you get the reward.   These should be things like:

-Win 5 solo matches this season  
-Win 25 games this season
-Win 2 games in a row
-Kill 10 people in one match
-Win a Squad Game with all members of your squad being alive
-Kill 4 players within 10 seconds
-Do 100,000 damage to enemy structures in one match
-Use 4,000 material in one match
-Revive 5 people in one match
-Complete all challenges in all 10 weeks
-Complete 50 daily challenges
-Reach Level 50
-Reach Level 60
-Reach Level 70
-Reach Level 80

The above would all be challenging for almost the entire player base. A lot of people would not be able to do it and that is ok, that is the point.   A couple of these could be cheesed which is common with these types of challenges.  From there, it is dealer's choice.  You can accomplish several of the truly hard items or you can grind to level 80 to make up for your inability to do so.  I think this is a much more fair and rewarding way to go.  If you are truly good you get rewarded.  If you aren't that good but are willing to grind, you can get the reward too.   Right now the level 80 XP thing means it doesn't matter very much how good you are, it just matters that you are willing to play a ton and that seems like a poor way to reward great players.

Personally, I like the stables at Fatal Fields, the two houses south of Snobby Shores, and lately, the two warehouses on the western shore of Loot Lake.

* Stables at Fatal: I can usually get two chests there, plus plenty of guns/ammo/materials in the patch of woods to the northeast.  Often, I can get a kill or two as players head north to Salty Springs.

* The two houses to the south of Snobby have good loot and I'm usually alone when I land there.  After I loot those houses, I can head southeast to Greasy or northeast to the Rec complex.  If I see that somebody else will beat me to this spot, I'll shift either north to Snobby or east to the film location. 

* West shore of Loot Lake: There's always a chest or two and there's always a player to two to kill that drop with me.  If I win those quick 1v1 battles and depending on where the circle is, I can then catch players moving away from Tilted Towers, Anarchy Acres, or Pleasant Park.

I was and still am really bad. I couldn’t ever kill anyone with a shotgun since that’s what was primarily used when I started playing. With the recent patches I have improved. Here’s how bad players have found a spot in the community:

• You can use the mini gun and both smg’s now which you can hit shots with if you have bad aim. For some reason the shogun feels extremely weak now. I only hit for 6 and 9. I find myself killing players that are good by using C4 and the mini gun.

•The good players that always build all over me can’t one pump me anymore giving me an opportunity to kill them and burn their resources and mini shields. So for new players I recommend AR spam since there is no damage decrease anymore.

•I always had trouble finding a SCAR but now you can use any suppressed smg and do just as well. 

With epic lowering the skill gap I recommend new players use the spray mechanic like I do. It’s extremely effective. I have been getting around 2 wins a week starting 3 weeks ago. Don’t get discouraged!

Since the Battlehound cameback I saw 1-2 of them and probably 2-3 capes. I would still consider the skin rare.

3 weeks ago I went in the replay mode and calculated how many times a skin showed up: [here's the result](https://imgur.com/a/i3DbxgG) after looking at 13 games with an average of 80 skins per game (can't see all of them because of the radius, I tried going in the middle everytime). I know that's not alot of games but you get the idea. If you guys are interested, I could do this experiment again and link the spreadsheet so you can see which skins are actually rare.

I do think though that they have to be more specific about limited time skins. They could have those REAL limited time skins Mythic rarity (the same from STW) so we know when a skin won't ever comeback. It would prevent alot of Twitter spam for sure.",FortNiteBR

* Exhausting server capacity, 
* Matchmaking queue back-pressure specific to the LTM, 
* Recovering when new capacity is added, etc

It's hard to know whether we'll have to make any additional system changes in order to meet our test goals right now.

Lets start from season 1-3:

If you notice the whole fortnite world, the environment every looks cartoony, happy and almost fake... We are players surviving in this small island where a storm just shrinks slowly...

[Fortnite environment - Season 1-3](https://i.redd.it/f91g7slpuj711.jpg)

Now season 4 - Where things come to light.

When season 4 came out every single trailer was saying ""The world will never be the same"", this indicates the impact the season will have in the game. When season 4 came the characters started looking... real compared to first 3 seasons.

[Look at the difference](https://i.redd.it/41776c5ruj711.png)

This whole Fortnite world is inside a controlled Dome (This helped finish my theory! Source: Ninja's brother sent him a text implying this and I agree), Being controlled from the outside, lets call them Outsiders The moment season 4 comes this meteor came from the outside, meaning it wasn't really meant from the outsiders it just broke inside the dome and there was a tv broadcast because the outsiders knew about it... Wait, did you ask why no crack like the rocket? Well thank God it was a cinematic, the outsiders were able to hide all of this but not stop it of course. Now, I believe what came from the meteor where outsiders (Thats why they look realistic now) actually trying to help us survivors escape. Now, they are villains and heroes so here is what actually happened, only the heroes came in from the outside but the outsiders created the villains to make it all look normal and to camouflage it more the made the theme to be about movies as if its all a movie! It doesn't connect with the meteor, I mean superhero movies where hot when season 4 came out so lets hide it with that"". So now that you know the purpose of these heroes, the rocket? Yup it was being used by a hero to break the barrier trapping us in this dimension, the hero was trying to brake us free, thats why the rocket kept getting in and out when at the end he successfully broke the barrier which is the crack in the sky and its slowly breaking open:

[Dimension barrier shattered](https://i.redd.it/0uii19tsuj711.jpg)

Season 5 might be a different whole world maybe, who knows.  
I came up with this whole theory slowly looking at the last 2 season and coming up with ideas based on what has been given to us through the game.

Tell me your thoughts on this!

148,xMashu,1530543538,8vja20,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vja20/editing_fatigue_suggestion/,1,"Editing ""Fatigue"" Suggestion","Hi there! 

As everyone is aware of now, a recent change to editing tiles was made, largely targeted at ""turtling"" and ""1 way peeking"" where an unfair advantage was given to a player waiting in a 1x1, making all the tiles opaque, and just watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

But this also countered and nerfed aggressive editing, which was something that I don't think the community really had a problem with, as it required a lot of skill and was a risk/reward factor, because the player could be waiting with a pump aimed at your head and right after you edit before you can pull out a gun you could get shot.

So what I was thinking to keep Epic's original intent of countering turtling and 1x1 peeking, was ""Editing Fatigue,"" modeled after the Jump Fatigue we have had forever to keep shotgun battles from turning into a Rabbit vs Kangaroo war. 

It would work like this -- when you first go into edit mode and select a tile, it is initially opaque. If you just sit there for let's say 3-5 seconds staring through it, it very quickly begins to color in, eventually leading to the gray color we have now. You may ask, well then wouldn't 1x1 turtlers just leave edit mode and re edit the tiles over and over to get the opaque ones? Solution -- the game registers time in edit mode and keeps track of it per player and not per tile when it comes to opaqueness or color. So that way if you switch to another built piece or just keep toggling the same one over and over, it would be in some stage of gray or fully gray depending on how long you've been switching back and forth. 

This would encourage using the aggressive editing and discourage turtling and 1x1 clear peeking because it would be impossible to do as it would eventually end up going gray no matter what you did. If Epic chose to do this, they could work out the numbers of seconds and how much/quickly it turns gray, the numbers I threw out were just somewhat random and for purpose of explanation. 

TLDR: Keep quick edits so people can outplay others, but add an edit timer that tracks how long each player edits any owned structure and have it constantly going to gray every time they click on an edit tile.  ",FortNiteBR

And btw, are battlepass 2 skins OG skins ? this game isn't even 1 year old yet and people consider black knight and red are OG skin, sure they are rare but I really dont think they are OG skins. I see this term thrown away alot but I only think that real OG skins are season 1 and halloween skins, since they were in shop before the game blow up.

* You popularized many sayings and I often hear a lot of people/small streamers who admire you say things like ""This game doo doo"" ""Come heeerrrreeee boiiiiiii"" ""Ooooggaaaa booooga"" and the most popular one ""brother."" (I know there are many more quotes people use from you but want to keep this as short as possible)  

* I watch your streams consistently and people will often donate or post in chat saying that you make their day, they watch you when they are feeling down with depression/anxiety, or that you simply make them laugh which goes beyond just ""gaming.""  

* To my knowledge you haven't been involved with any drama like some other streamers and your positive energy is contagious.  

* As a fellow person of color, I appreciate the positive representation you give the black community. With the society we live in it warms my heart hearing the amazing things people say to you during stream, twitter, or \*insert any platform\*  

* It's easy to go on about the great things you do but hopefully others in the comments can add input as well.  


We use to chat occasionally before you blew up and I remember giving you advice on your thumbnails which you thanked me and they improved. I am writing this on a smurf account because I do not seek any recognition and just want to thank you on behalf of those who watch you. I can speak for myself and hopefully many others that you are an underrated streamer but your contribution to society is bigger than gaming. Thank you and continue to live your best life!",FortNiteBR

this can't be right..i don't need the new mode thats coming soon (soon.... :P) i want normal combat without this bugs happing all over the place..

Insert complaint B... is too hard for new/ casual players?,"The main two examples of this are literally in recent posts. One talked about skill based matchmaking and the other about how grinds for certain level rewards were too difficult for the casual player. Firstly, I can’t speak for everyone, but I’d assume more often than not that the dedicated player plays as much as they do because he/she wants to be better than most players in their game. They want to win more. If you yourself truly want to be better than most and want to win more, play more. If you’re thinking, well I don’t have as much free time to be as dedicated, then it shouldn’t bother you that the majority of the time you’re fighting people who are more skilled. You should just understand that this person put in
more time, hence they are probably better at the game and should on aggregate win more often than I should. With skill based matchmaking in a BATTLE ROYALE game, a win would virtually always need an asterisk next to it denoting what skill level it was. Also, would we just wipe stats obtained up until the matchmaking was implemented? Not even going to discuss the potential issues of smurfing that virtually all matchmaking systems suffer from. I could understand the argument for matchmaking if every single battle ended in favor of the more skilled player, but that’s definitely not the case. Everyone who plays this game has died from the notorious bush camper, and has been the bush camper, figuratively. The point I’m trying to make is what makes a Battle Royale unique is that random aspect of it. The fact that you can be in some crazy build battle with another skilled player, but some random guy comes and shoots down your building and kills both of you. Implement skill based matchmaking, and I guarantee the player base declines dramatically. I’d literally bet anything on it. Of course, the player who puts more time in wins more and kills more. Does that stop you from winning and killing altogether? That’s simply how it should be. I hate to say it, but if you can’t accept that then perhaps a BATTLE ROYALE game is not for you. 

Secondly, complaints about certain rewards being too difficult to grind for “ casual players” . For example, full omega.... sure it’s a lot of grinding, but no one is forcing you to do it. If you really want it, then put the time in and get the XP. If everyone simply got full omega just by having the battle pass, do you really think anyone would give a shit about it? If you’re saying, “ yeah it still looks cool “, you’re lying to yourself. 

tl;dr : There shouldn’t be mechanics that decrease gaps between “dedicated” and “casual” players. If you’re a “casual” player who, as many “casual” players love to say, doesn’t have the time than it shouldn’t bother you because you understand the fundamental rule of virtually everything that
 MORE TIME = MORE RESULTS

As we are in a current market where WW2 based games are having a bit of a resurgence. COD-WW2, Battlefield V. So it would make sense from a marketing point of view to jump the band wagon while it lasts. So the Sky bring a time rift makes some sense. 

I read previously that Omen may be a supposed time traveler, as is The Visitor. So the overall super villain story ark could be to alter the past or turn our BR island into a time nexus of sorts.

I guess we will find out more clues in a few days either way. Fun to speculate on though.

This is interesting to me and I suppose you can make your own assumptions just by reading comments on the various posts, the posts itself as well as reactions to certain events Epic makes happen in the game.

Case in point the latest one, the rocket launch. That to me was very cool but probably for reasons different to the majority of Fortnites player base.

Disclaimer: My first console was the Nintendo. The first one. It came with a 110 in 1, with classics such as Mario Brothers, Pac-Man, Bomber Man, Tetris and the like. You could not save the game so each time you had to start from scratch.(I was only allowed to play 2 hours a day, meaning I had to somehow try to progress faster in order to advance further in the game. There was no speed running back then!)

Guys and girls my age today grew up with games. We were the first ones, the originals I suppose. We loved it then, we love it now. We will probably still play it once we have retired to an old age home and guess what: the 12 year olds of today will do the same.

I have played Fortnite with some great kids and some not so great adults. The other way around as well. In my opinion your age should not matter in the gaming world, but rather what you bring to the table in terms of teamwork and just having a good time in a game like Fortnite. I don’t understand why people would want to know your age in this game, or any other game, and I also never ask people. (The question as to where you are from, that is more interesting to me.)

In any case, what Epic is doing is amazing. Even more so with their continued involvement with the community. The rocket launch was great to me. Here you had a real time event with millions of people participating in it. The theories afterwards about what will happen is fantastic. Or why certain things happened. It really is great.

Gaming has come a long way since the days when you could not even save your progress!

Thanks for scanning through this post, next time you see me on the battlefield please do not kill me. I’m still looking for my first win!

If Epic could read your inputs aka controller inputs and queue you up with ONLY console players as long as you're only using the controller it'd make cross platform even easier.

Obviously simply queuing people with console just by having a controller plugged in wouldn't work but if there was a way to lock people into using the controller, for example if I have my controller plugged in when opening Skyrim and some other games I can't use PC controls unless I unplug the controller.

Or if there was a way to read inputs and punish players as soon as PC inputs were used. Maybe map out general PC controls and have them as ""banned"" inputs and allow ones like Alt tab, esc and mouse movement in the menus.

Maybe it's just me that has this issue, not even a big deal but it'd be a cool way to let PC play with console without forcing console to  play at a massive disadvantage.",FortNiteBR

From what i gather some guy got 48 kills while everyone was watching the rocket. Im not sure how he got them tbh wether he chopped the ramps up or exploded the ramps or as i just read he didnt actually do anything and the rocket broke the ramps and gave him credit for it. What happened im not entirely sure so would like to know exactly what happened if you know for a fact. 

Anyway i think his record should stand unless he didnt knock the ramp down and it was the rocket. Only if this option is what happened do i think his record should not stand. The way i see it it's not his fault that 48 people decided to build a giant ramp into sky to watch a rocket that the killer may or may not have had any idea about. The killer was the one playing the game the 48 technically weren't playing the game in the right spirit.
Sute thus was a big event and quite an amazing thing at that but just remember there are people who play this game casually. There would have been many who played the game that day with no idea about a rocket or nothing.  They shouldn't be bad mouthed or treated like trolls because if this. Obviuosly if it was the ricket then most if what i said is irrelevant lol but if its not guve the guy tye record ar the end if the day he killed 48 people without any if them noticing him.

Theories as of now are about Greeks / Romans / Pirates and generally an ancient time period that will leak through the crack. Sounds pretty awesome!

What I would like to ""suggest"" is that Epic probably could make  a mini movie about this whole story for the intro of Season 5. I loved the one that introduced us to Season 4 (after all the hype and the speculations) but I'd like something a bit more explanatory, not advertising the battle pass emotes/skins but a 5-10 minute video explaining even without voices, the whole thing that was going on with the Visitor, the Omega/Carbide fight (and movie). 

Obviously it is a Battle Royal game, it is not  intended to have a story line, but what EPIC is doing is just amazing, and I love how everyone tries to find clues and EPIC also tries to play with us (baiting us that the rocket would destroy TT was bold), however we're already deep in the story kinda, I mean the community obviously loves this stuff, EPIC is good at this stuff, so some simple animated mini movie kind of explaining small stuff that can't be said with assets in-game would be amazing.

**TL;DR:** *I'd love to see a longer mini movie than the one that introduced season 4, which will explain what we've been seeing and guessing all this time about the characters.*",FortNiteBR

Reason being is SMGs are extremely more versatile and power than shotguns and kind of makes shotgun somewhat obsolete now. 

In my opinion, with the new huge buff to both tactical and silence SMGs, shotguns should be reverted and both guns would be rewarding to use.

SMGs could be used by players who aren’t as confident in their headshot capabilities, but want to go for the so called “spray a pray” (not really the case with the SMGs but you get what I am saying.) Where as shotguns could be used by players who are confident enough to get he headshot and be rewarded if so. 

TLDR; With the new buff to SMGSs, shotguns should be reverted to their previous state for more balance. At the moment SMGs feel better and easier to use.

I've been scrolling through this community on a whim and I really like the memes and discussion so I figured I'd ask you guys for some advice. I have played 1 or 2 games of fortnite and to be honest, I was a bit lost of what was good/bad gun wise (beyond rarity) and the strategy when it comes to building. I looked up some ""new to Fortnite"" videos but all seem outdated or just hastily thrown together so a few questions

1. For BR, what are the most highly trafficked areas in the game as far as drops and loot?
2. Where should I start to learn how to quickly build and get used to the UI? Its far different than what I'm used too for my games. (I am playing on PC if that means anything)
3. What should I go for loot wise early on? Are there end game loots people MUST have beyond weapon rarity?
4. Is there any BR benefit for purchasing the full retail game? Or is battlepass enough for longevity?

Thanks all! I know these are some basic questions (and as an avid gamer I feel like a complete noob for asking them) but I'd like to have some ideas of whats good/bad and current metas so I can better understand how to approach the game.

If fortnite BR &amp; STW were to take place in the same universe, what would prevent monsters from being everywhere, as they are in STW? Well that's where the giant shield in the sky comes into play. 

However that giant shield just got hit by a rocket, and is slowly cracking as seen in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vft3r/proof_that_the_fracture_is_steadily_growing_with/) ... what happens once the shield shatters?

332,domm301,1530517364,8vgug7,25,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vgug7/the_og_players/,12,The “Og” Players,"This community has players complaining about og skins coming out and how og players are better than new players. 

First of all there’s a part of the community that don’t want “og” skins to come back such as the Red Knight. If you want a skin because of it’s rarity and not because YOU like how it looks then that’s the most idiotic thing. I see many people also saying “bringing back the red knight will just take off its rarity and not be good anymore” or “The red knight is only for og players” That basically means that you just like the red knight because of it’s rarity or it makes you feel “special” even though you’re not that special.

Second of all i just want to address this. That you “og” players out there aren’t og because you’ve been playing the game since season 2. The real og players come from save the world before BR was even released because we all know it hasn’t even been a year since it has been released.

Third of all there is this other funny part of the community that always say “I’ve been playing since season 2 and saw the skull trooper on the item shop but I didn’t know i would be playing this much and i regret it ever since. I know damn well that if this game never blew up you wouldn’t even worry about that skin. In other words you’re saying “I’ve been playing since season 2 and saw the skull trooper on the item shop but i didn’t know this game would blow up and be one of the rarest skins that would make me look good and to this day i still regret it”

I’ve been playing since season 2 and don’t care about rarity of skins, don’t care how long you’ve been playing, and don’t care how good you are. And also just to let you guys know i love fortnite and love the community and in this post I’ve just gathered all the things I’ve loaded since i follow a lot of fortnite. And also remember it is a free game so there will be many different types of players and opinions so if you have an argument  make sure to comment maturely. 


TL;DR: Buy a skin because you like it and not because it’s rarity, og players aren’t as og, people say that they regret not buying skull trooper after seeing it in the item shop, and how i love the fortnite game/community

Make it so that the matchmaking evaluates your stats (KDR, Win ratio, etc.) and puts you into games with people who have similar skill. This would give new or unskilled players a place to get experience and develop skills. I'm tired of getting out performed in every single game and it is even worse with the shotguns getting nerfed it the point where i don't even look twice at them on the ground.

I have 69 total wins (28 solo wins, 28 duo wins, and 13 squad wins). But recently i've decided that I really want to made a drive to improve and be a top tier player at some point. I know that can be an unrealistic goal and I probably have a long way till i'm there but it's something I really am motivated to do. I've been trying to watch some streams and videos on little tips to help me improve and i've learned a thing or 2 from that, but nothing that has shown great results. I would say that my building is pretty decent but not perfect, my decision making is pretty good for the most part I like to think, and my shooting is probably my weakest point. It's by no means bad but at the same time I choke shots that no one should ever choke (and maybe part of that is because I get extremely nervous under pressure in top 10 or less situations). People always say that landing tilted and focusing on slaying out rather than winning is the best way to improve your accuracy and over fighting overall. But I have been hesitant to try it. So I figured I would ask you guys if you think going tilted every game is a good strat for improving shooting. What are pros/cons things like that? Thanks in advanced!

TL;DR: I want to become a fantastic/top tier player but I kinda suck at shooting, especially when under pressure/ in top 10 situations. Do you think landing tilted every game will REALLY help improve that? Also what are pros/cons of landing tilted every game.

I rarely have friends to play with so I mostly play solos. I do decent, almost always reaching mid game. I've completed all the challenges so far and did most of the daily challenges. I reached tier 100 around week 6, and I'm only at level 68, I would have to play around 6-7 hours a day and get 3,000 xp each hour to be able to reach level 80 by the end of the season, and I just don't have the time to be able to do that. The game starts getting really boring and repetitive to me after playing for many hours in one day, making grinding levels even harder. It takes me around 2-5 hours to level up once in the later levels without challenges, this makes leveling to 80 a very long grind that isn't fun. 

The grind to reach level 80 to unlock the colors for the omega seems way to unfair to players who are decent but can't spend all day playing, I feel like it should be lowered to at least around level 65 or 70 to make it reasonable for players who don't have that much time on their hands, or aren't that good. 

while I agree that getting the colors for the omega should be decently hard for the average player, it should also be fun and not a long repetitive grind to complete. Most players should reach around level 50-60 by the end of the seasons so I'd say it being around 65 or 70 would still make it hard to get for most, but way less of a grind for those like me. Right now the colors for the omega feels like they are only for those who bought their way to tier 100, or play tons of hours each day, and have a large group of friends, or those who are really good and win most of their games.

I hope they will either lower it or let players finish it after the season has ended, because its really annoying that I spent so much time playing and still won't be able to complete the skin and change its colors, only because I can't play all day, and i'm not good enough to win most games.

* At the start of the season Hop Rocks were added into the game and just recently the rocket caused a crack in the sky. Add these two together and what do you get? That's right Crack Rock.
* Hop rocks are super fun and exciting until the high eventually runs off making you hungry for more just like a real drug
* They also added in Magic Mushrooms all around the map that give you a boost of shield. More shield makes you more likely to do dangerous things, just like how taking magic mushrooms makes you do stupid stuff
* This battlepass' skins are heroes and guess what word hero is in. Heroin
* The rocket got launched into the sky which is a hint that you will be getting high next season. 
* They added in new detective skins and an agency to investigate the recent spike in drug related deaths
* The new ""eagle"" emote is mocking flying and where do you fly? High, that's where. 
* The new shopping carts and bouncer pads allows you to ride while high up, there fore ""riding a high""
* The trees and grass are green on the map and so is weed

In this theory u/thecourierwatches says that the visitor most likely came form a different time period and is trying to return back to his time period with the rocket but what if the Visitor is actually Dr. Vinderman. (a little backstory) Dr. Vinderman is the creator of Vindertech. Vindertech is a shady company in STW that knew the storm was coming but couldn't stop it. In a STW mission you visit a lab looking for Dr. Vinderman but you cannot find him and theres is purple portal looking objects there. What f Dr. Vinderman was sucked into one of these portals and transported into a another dimension or space so he builds a capsule and puts himself inside a meteor heading to earth knowing that his company Vindertech will go there and release him but he fails and lands on a island so he uses Vindertech's resources (the cars, trucks) and hop rocks he found in wherever he was to return back to one of the STW areas (most likely Canny Valley as this is receiving its new quest line) so he (taken from [this theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8vc62x/the_island_isnt_protected_by_a_shield_the/) modifies the fake rocket into a functional rocketutilizing the hop rocks, and other samples of his time period's tech that fell on the island.
The ""cracks"" you saw on the rocket's launch were tears upon the fabric of the space-time continuum. The Visitor did several loops through the island to get enough speed to completely RIP through space-time so he could go back home. This is backed up by the increasing size of each crack as the rocket went in and out of different time periods.
Now, you may be wondering, why did the final crack stay while the others quickly vanished?
The Visitor fucked up.
He created such a large tear through our universe that he caused permanent damage to our dimension as a whole.",FortNiteBR

* 17 XP per minute alive.
* 300 XP for winning.
* 200 XP for placing second.
* 150 XP for placing third.
* 100 XP for placing in the top 10.
* 50 XP for placing in the top 20.
* 25 XP for placing in the top 50.
* 50 XP for your first kill, after that it gives 20 per kill up to a max of 120 extra XP.

This system will allow the no-skin that hid all game with zero kills and placed second to get more XP than the Max Omega tryhard with 10+ kills who placed 9th. This is unnacceptable, and promotes boring playstyles that solely involve moving to a new hiding spot whenever you don't get zone.

My suggestion? Buff and rework the entire XP system to reward more aggressive playstyles better than 100 player games of hide-and-seek.

* Keep XP for survival time and placement the same, but:
* Give 100 XP for your first kill. After that:
* 30 XP for explosive eliminations.
* 50 XP for eliminations with ARs, SMGs, Pistols (Excluding Revolver and Deagle), and Shotguns.
* 70 XP for kills with Snipers, Scoped ARs, and Revolvers + Deagles.
* 80 XP for kills with Traps and Great Falls.
* 100 XP for kills with Harvesting Tools.
* ^^ All that, plus the range of their kill (if it shows up in the killfeed) divided by 4, rounded up if there's a decimal, and 30 XP for any headshot kills.
(Just a note, in squad modes the *knock* would count for the XP, not the full elim.)
After you *win* a game, here's some bonus XP you could get depending on how many kills you have:
* ""Pacifist!"" - 0 kills  (100 XP) *Its hard to get a 0 kill win. Not only do you have to survive the entire match, but you also have to deal with the last player(s). You need to bank on them killing themselves, dying to storm, or killing each other at the same time.*
* ""One-Hit Wonder!"" - 1 kill (50 XP)
* ""Dubs!"" - 2 kills (60 XP)
* ""Tri-Hard"" - 3 kills (70 XP)
* ""Quadrilateral!"" - 4 kills (80 XP)
* ""Quin-tastic!"" - 5 kills (100 XP)
* ""Hexa-mazing! - 6 kills (110 XP)
* ""Salute!"" - 7 kills (120 XP) *Y'know, since 7 looks like a hand saluting?*
* ""Gr-eight!"" - 8 kills (130 XP)
* ""Nine Foes A-Vanquished!"" - 9 kills (140 XP)
* ""Double Digits!"" - 10-19 kills (200-290 XP respectively)
* ""Twenty Bomb!"" - 20-29 kills (350-440 XP)
* ""Ultra Tri-Hard!"" - 30-39 kills (500-590 XP)
* ""How?!"" - 40-99 kills (750 XP flat)
I'm not saying this should be added in-game as-is, but it would be nice to see more risk over reward playstyles get rewarded. What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

So I do not post much (or at all), but I wanted to throw out a few thoughts and comments on how I believe EPIC is doing with Battle Royale.

For starters: Season 4 

Battle Pass. I see alot of complaints on the amount of ""grinding"" this season has talen to get the desired level 80 ""full unlock"". 

Im my opinion this was an awesome move, not only does it allow for a relatively normal doffoculty to unlock the 100 tier, but also gave us something else to aspire to throughout the season. I know I personally unlocked Omega quickly and would probably have lost some interest in the season if I didnt want those colored lights so badly. I understand this made alot of people angry, but they need to realize games need to have things that require alot of work to obtain. 

As far as the updates.

I want to say I understand many of the people who have started to play this game are younger gamers, who have not had a long history with games. I myself am almost 30 years old and have been ""gaming"" for almost 20 of those years. Something often forgotten especially on Xbox and PS4 is that games rarely last more than a year or 2 of use. On PC we are fortunate enough to see games like Leagie of Legends, Overwatch, SWTOR, and many other games that continue with a loyal fambase for many years. 

Epic Games is attempting to lift Fortnite into that next level. A game that will have a following for years to come. 

Something else they have always been criticized for (mainly by PUBG fanboys) is Fortnite's legitimacy as a shooter. Fortnite has long been a Build and Shotgun type of game. The problem with that, is it isnt how most proper shooting games function. It minimizes how players effectively use the rest of the weapon set available. 

If you watch these updates, piece by piece, Epic is creating an even more legitimate shooter. Now I am NOT saying they have arrived, i am saying its improving.

The shotgun nerf was to minimize people depending on them

The building nerf was to minimize people who dont fight properly and instead simply build continously. 

Buffs to other weapons like the minigun and now SMGs all attempts to bring viability to these other weapons. 

The opaque editing, was to minimize the amount of time people spend in hiding avoiding conflict. 

And there are many others...


I write this knowing this will likely be downvoted, however I feel its important to shed a little perspective on the subject.

This is just one Gamers perspective, feel free to comment and question. I enjoy friendly discussion and am more than open to correction on these thoughts.

So who can tell me the similarities between NBA 2K18, COD WW2 and most other games now. The answer is they are ruined by non thought out ideas. The most recent idea I have seen on here was to make a sniper have the be charged up so quickscoping would no longer be viable. At first, that may seem like a great idea, but if you can quickscope someone, it means you have built the skill to do that. Another thing I have been disagreeing with is the mats nerf. Now look, I know epic wants to cater to everyone, but this game thrived only because the building was unique and new! Everything Epic has done since season 2 has slowly, but surely, decreased the skill gap. This game was best when people on this reddit were thrilled about what EPIC was going to come out with, not just them bringing in terrible, not planned ideas by the few who are not good enough, or dont try to be good enough, at the things in this game that take skill.

Regardless I think it would be pretty cool and would fit the theme. Yes, I have been lectured that it would invalidate all time and effort people who were there when the seasons were out put in, but you would not get it all at once, you'd grind for it alongside season 5.

I'm sorry but I just want some opinions or advice. 


So first, a backup story. I got video games taken away for two years (literally) 
because I didn't turn in a homework assignment on time and I had a ""attitude"" so I got grounded until I could ""fix"" it. I didn't play games at all through junior high. I got my ps4 back on Christmas of this year. (That was their main present, a PlayStation I purchases 2 years ago with my own money). 
I got fortnite  during Christmas and have played about an hour daily. I have to read as much as i play, for example if i read an hour i can use screens like tvs, consoles, movies for an hour. My parents say I'm addicted.( they hate video games) and they blame every thing on games.
I was a freshman this year, and I do good in school as I moved up to honors and get straight a`s normally.

I got my grade card on Wednesday of last week. I got A's and two B's. My parents are going bonkers. I'm not aloud to play video games all summer and when I get back in school I can only play during weekend's. 

I'm only level 55 and I'm tier 88. I love the movie Napoleon Dynamite and I was so hyped for week 9 to come out so I can get the emote. Then I got grounded. Two days later, this crazy event with the rocket happened. Double xp weekend happened. Dual pistols released the day I got grounded. Tommy gun coming soon. Sick detective skin came out. My day 112 stw 800 vbuck reward was happening in five days. 

All. Summer. Long.

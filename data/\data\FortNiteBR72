A lot


Back in season 4 if you did 90s your opponent would just quit the game cause he will think you have build hacks

Back then there was a skill gap, now I'm not saying double pump is balanced all I'm saying is you could tell a good player from a bad one depending on their act

Now its like : SweatTTVBTW killed 8 people with a pistol


Now with the world Cup everyone is gonna be sweating their asses off.

And I don't want to be part of it I couldn't care less don't involve me.


I just want to login in the morning play a few games without getting 5 90's laid on me cause I shoot at a soccer skin with a silenced pistol.


Am I asking for too much ?",FortNiteBR

Things have been heating up since that volcano emerged out of nowhere, but to be honest even with a random iceberg and Ice King showing up -- our little island has been hot hot hot for awhile now. All these kids playing Soccer and master carpenters assembling 90s into the heavens -- they're dripping sweat and thirsty for your elimination.  


Now, don't get me wrong -- there has been a lot of great community feedback on the topic and I'm sure Epic is tweaking, and shifting and they haven't even reached the Apex of their potential yet. But until then, how can you keep enjoying the game without rage quitting, smashing your keyboard, or even worse -- playing another game!? Luckily for you Lil Whip is here to give you some cool tips to stay calm and enjoy the game!  


1. Put on your favorite streamer and act like you're playing as them! I'll never be as good as Dr.Lupo or TimtheTatman, but by golly I can act like I am! I've gotten so many more wins and kills since I started doing this! Plus I'm actually playing with friends and laugh... loudly... by myself...  

2. Go AFK in Squads and land in a tree! Your teammates can do all the hard lifting while you're eating a delicious bowl of Ice Cream from SoFDeeZ. Our newest special is the ""Stream Snipering Mother\*\*\*\*\*\*"" (Gotta protect the kids!). It's blue and yellow ice cream and tastes like salt, raisins, and bologna.   

3. Every time you die in a solo game, go to the bathroom, look in the mirror and ask yourself, with those big bags under your eyes -- Could I have gone through medical school by now? If the answer is yes, join the club and use the cry emote. You've invested too much of your life into this game to be salty now. Get back out there!  

4. Finally, and maybe most importantly, drop the $12 on your very own Soccer Skin\* and you'll miraculously be good at the game and always win and enjoy yourself!  
^(\*Side effects may include not always winning, raging, losing your significant other, feeling meaningless at work or school, and dreaming about getting flossed on. If your erection last more than four hours after clutching a 1v4, call a doctor and tell him how good your are at the game, he'll be impressed and give you an award - not. Go drool over Lynx somewhere else. I mean really?! You're getting this from a man who dresses up as a Ice Cream cone and lives in is his mom's basement. Be better.)  


That's all from me, your friend, Lil Whip! Get out there and Save The World or whatever \*\*\*\* we're supposed to be doing. What the heck is the story again? Zombies, a giant cube, Ice King, and *Back to the Future* hoverboards... Well go have fun kids!",FortNiteBR

**building**


Believe me when I say this but if you‚Äôre actually half decent at aiming and thinking, this game isn‚Äôt hard. There‚Äôs no wonder why you see people who were ‚Äúgood‚Äù at CSGO or other games being legit gods at this game, it‚Äôs seriously a easy game with a new mechanic, building which is the part most pros and everyone else are new to learning.

If you were actually ‚Äúcompetent‚Äù or ‚Äúgood‚Äù at the game you‚Äôd have a win this season, the game isn‚Äôt as stressful as people make it, people might be a lot better than earlier seasons but if you played through all the seasons you should‚Äôve been able to keep up with the skill gap, and literally, to pubstomp in this game is insanely easy. 


**to clarify, I‚Äôm saying pubs in this game are insanely easy and anyone complaining isn‚Äôt as competent as they think, and are just super whiny, ranked mode is a good idea but won‚Äôt fix them losing every match. In theory, you‚Äôd win 1/100 matches you played in your rank**

And

**TLDR: This game is insanely easy to play pubs in and get wins if you are actually mildly decent at any other game due to how lackluster this games mechanics are besides building which is the core mechanic people can‚Äôt adapt to but tell everyone else to ‚ÄúJuSt AdApT‚Äù when some new bullshit item comes out**

It removes the need for big pots.

This frees up a slot for an additional weapon, so the better players have another advantage with additional weapon slots.

Some big team games are as lopsided as when the Super Sword was around.  100-30/50 is not competitive.

The problem is the building mechanic, its started as a side mechanic but is now a main one and players that can build very well are quite literally untouchable by casuals who dont want to build their ass off.

They quite literally cant fix the problem, not anymore without facing backlash. They are the ones too blame too by adding turbo building.
They simply cant fix the problem. Add items that counter building or nerf it? The entire community cries for nerfs/vaults. Now they will probably add a ranked mode at some point. But that wont change anything.

I would *never* go back to native res (1920x1080). With a stretched resolution, you get a much wider field of view, more FPS and an overall smoother experience. The game feels much faster in my opinion. 

I understand that some people don‚Äôt like stretched resolutions because they make the game look ugly, but I find that 1920x1080 is like having tunnel vision. You can‚Äôt really see properly on either side of you. Stretched gives you a much wider perspective. 

Not *everyone* is using a stretched resolution in the hopes of being regarded as a sweaty player. Some people are using a stretched res because it genuinely enhances their game in a positive way.

Building has been in the game since the beginning, there is no excuse for not knowing how to build at this point. Its your own fault for neglecting the most important aspect in the game.

The shotgun is the biggest problem of Fortnite BR, and I'm not exaggerating, these are the reasons of many players who want to have fun during the game and can not:

1- How can the shotgun be more powerful than the rocket launcher? Fortnite BR is the only game in PVP that this could be possible. Several times I hit a missile in a player in the head, and it did not kill him, but when I use the shotgun he falls.

2- With the shotgun, you do not have the possibility to play with other weapons, because without it in close combat you have no chances. I do not have the possibility of using a pistol, or an SMG. Again, the only PVP, in which I can only depend on a weapon to survive, and that does not make sense.

3- There is no difference between using a Blue Pump and a Gold Heavy, both damage is very high. With both a shot you die.

What is the purpose of this post: The shotgun is an OP weapon, it is destroying the possible and diversifiability of using OTHER WEAPONS, and with that it is ONLY creating a combat method, build to get close to the player and eliminate it with the shotgun.
Fortnite needs to stop worrying about creating so many SKINS, and worrying about creating new weapons and the possibility of battles, the shotgun is creating a game method that is destroying BR fun and creating new fighting.",FortNiteBR

Please make other suggestions below.

&amp;#x200B;

**Turret:** No one uses it for the end game, only at the basement in the blue house in salty at the beginning of game, really easy to get killed when on it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Thermal Scoped AR:** Really slow fire rate compared to Scoped AR, Harder to use than Scoped Revolver. If it doesn't get removed, then it should at least go to blue/purple rarity (scoped revolver should also drop down in rarity) as it is NOT a legendary item.

&amp;#x200B;

**(Change) Rocket and Grenade Launcher:** Rocket launcher should get a delay (like the pump) when you equip it as it will make it less spammy (in my last game, it was a 1v1 final circle, and the other guy had 2 rocket launchers, so im mad lol). grenade launcher should get a slower fire rate, making sure that the enemy has at least a chance to breath.

&amp;#x200B;

**Infantry Rifle:** No one uses it unless its their only weapon. A normal AR is better for fire rate and clip, and a sniper does way more damage. it would be too late to change it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Deagle:** Since the nerf it is way less practical, the enemy can just switch to brick or metal, and a sniper or an AK47 is way better for long range.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here are some items that i think should return and why:

&amp;#x200B;

**Heavy Shotgun:** Rewarded precision with long range and solid damage. If it comes back, it should be a blue/purple instead of purple/gold rarity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Port-a-Fortress:** Very good item for new players that don't know how to build, but it should be a purple, instead of a gold.

&amp;#x200B;

**Sneaky Snowman:** Because it is very troll, but instead of a snowman, make it a scarecrow as there isn't as much snow now

&amp;#x200B;

**Bouncers:** Another very good item for new players and skilled players alike.

&amp;#x200B;

**Revolver:** It would be a very good replacement to the deagle if it got similar stats to it. imo the deagle is not a purple/gold weapon anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

**Rifts:** At the beginning of season 8, i noticed that there are WAY less rifts around the map. It ruined Viking Village for me, which was my favourite location in the map. Bring some of them back.

&amp;#x200B;

That's my list. Put down other items that you want to be vaulted/unvaulted, or tell me why certain weapons shouldn't be vaulted/unvaulted.

Thank You.

The first reason epic should take out glider redeploys, is because they just take up a percentage of loot drop that could be something such as shields

The next reason why epic should get rid of glider redeploys, is because nobody actually picks them up every time they see some and use them

third, if they take out glider redeploys they can add it back as it not being an item, if they do this epic games can also make more money because it would give people more of a reason to buy gliders, because they see them more often

last, if they take out glider redeploys and add it back but not as an item, they can decrease the spawn rate of launch pads and give more space to consumables",FortNiteBR

Sac for everyone who has at least 1 sub also ruined social media of fortnite. Every single tweet from Epic is spammed with use code xXvIrGinKIllaXx69xd, IG is absolutely trash, clout chasers stealing posts and baiting in kids, youtube has the worst clickbaiters from Fortnite. 50 hp for a kill ruined the game even more.

The Pixar-esque animation, as well as comical tone, makes for an instantly viable animated film. 

- Here's my pitch: 

-Exposition:
We have a squad of 4. Brite Bomber, Raptor, Rex, and Cuddle Team Leader. I'd imagine this takes place outside of any season We have the season 5 map, the most ideal map in my opinion as it is a unique biome and adds some freshness to the simple green color of the older season while not having any real story attached to it like the winter biome. 

Protagonists:
Brite Bomber is the main character, a rookie who's never won a game before. 

Raptor is the pro, with over a 100 confirmed wins and a body count too high to remember. 

Rex is the simple-minded dumbass, who can't keep his mind on the game and only plays to get the high stats. He's been carried to all of his wins and it's implied he barely knows how to play either.

CTL (addressed as 'Cuddles' in the movie) would rather be anywhere else, but she's only there because of her crush on Rex. She's kind of a brat, always talking to her friends in the lobby. She's kind of a burden on the team.


-Premise: 
The goal is simple: Last team standing wins. To most this would seem easy, but for Raptor and his gang of misfits, (Brite Bomber, Rex, and Cuddle Team Leader) victory isn't as easy as it seems. However, enthusiastic newbie Brite Bomber joins her best friends Rex and Cuddles and the Fill teammate, Raptor, to earn her first Victory Royale. 

-Antagonists:
The villains would be Black Knight and John Wick, the two solo squad-ers who eventually face off with Raptor, BB, Cuddles, and Rex.

But when there‚Äôs just that one guy who keeps building and not even trying to shoot at you and just hides until a 3rd party comes that‚Äôs a problem to me. It honestly ruins the game for me.

And before you say just get good. Well not everyone is 13 and can play video games all day so I do the best I can. Also I know building is what makes fortnite fortnite but some people overdo it and it takes away from gunplay.

I have some suggestions and let me know what you think.

1. Lower the material cap to 250 but you get 250 materials per kill (starting with wood and if that‚Äôs full the brick and so on and they‚Äôre directly put into your inventory)

2. Make the higher up buildings are have lower hp for example say a metal wall has 500 health on the ground (just an example) say at above 5 units it starts to lose 10% of its original health each unit. So the 500 health wall at 10 units high would only have around 250 health. Obviously metal has more health than wood so that would make a different max build height for wood, brick and metal.

3. Make building earn health slower. Right now I think buildings start with 90 health and go up by 9. Change it something like going up by 5. This way people can get shot down easier and won‚Äôt be as motivated to just build up really high

4. Make it so you can edit any structure. I hate when someone is just sitting in a box and you‚Äôre shooting at them but they just keep putting a wall (I know I should put my own wall and edit that but I play on PS4 so that‚Äôs basically impossible if the guy is just holding build in his box). And then they just wait until you have to reload and come out. 

5. Also with the newish addition where you get 50 health for killing someone there‚Äôs no point really to not finish someone. So my solution is to make it so you can‚Äôt finish downed players but... they lose 5 health every second while moving and 3 health every second while not moving.

6. Or another solution is to make it so when someone dies their teammate can pick up something (that takes up an inventory slot and can stack up to 2 per slot) and bring it to certain spots on the map (maybe like a medical tent in each named location) and put each thing there, wait 60 seconds without the teammate dying. And they can come back with 50 base health. And respawn with whatever wasn‚Äôt picked up from where they died. And before you say this is copying Apex, Apex copies the idea to bring teammates back from Realm Royale so get mad at Apex not Fortnite ",FortNiteBR
214,Pilarious,1552274964,azodqp,35,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/azodqp/for_those_who_think_these_huge_skill_gaps_are/,27,For those who think these huge skill gaps are inevitable. Play halo and it will change your mind,"Halo 1 has been out for 15+ years. I go back from time to time and hold my own enough to have fun.

I play fortnite almost exclusively since it came out and I can only get a kill every hour in the main modes. I know how to build and what not, but I still don‚Äôt stand a chance against the soccer skin who build/edit/shoots before I can blink. And that seems to be more than 75% of players left in these modes

These skill gaps are both a product of not having permanent ranked/social options, and catering too much to the competitive crowd for gameplay updates. It is a build/edit fest, and only the best players stand a chance in that type of gameplay. You used to have a chance to shoot down builders before they came at you, but it‚Äôs almost hopeless to try that now. Plus there are many items to ensure they won‚Äôt fall.

Fortnite has succumbed to the fate of listening too much to this community and it is costing them players. Sure fortnite will never die, but it has way more potential to be fun for everyone. I mean this is the game with the boogy bomb, yet we let try hards force the gameplay to be game 7 of the World Series every time you get in a fight. 

We need real gameplay changes if we want to keep fortnite alive for the non-competitive group. This is out of hand

Before some asshole calls me a bot, I‚Äôm not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be a competitive scene. But the fact that it‚Äôs the only way to play is extremely disappointing. I can‚Äôt have fun anymore like this. And I have other things to do besides practicing in the playground and watching twitch pros to learn more. I don‚Äôt expect to be great and win a lot. But never have I played a game where the average player is so fucked.",FortNiteBR

Solving problems is better than eliminate them,"According to this subreddit and overall opinion of the community about the Infantry Rifle, the two biggest problems about this gun are:

&gt; 1. Drop chances too high

&gt; 2. Bullet travel too slow


So instead of just vault it and taking off another mid range option, here's two suggestione of changes to players that like the Infantry Rifle continue using it or at least this gun continue being a option.

&gt; About the bullet travel: my suggestion is make it less terrible at close range making the shots of this gun have a decreasing bullet travel speed, so at close combat you wouldn't need to calculate because the shot would be almost hitscan at close to mid range and in mid range, to keep it balanced, the bullet travel speed would be the same.

&gt; About the drop chance: instead of common (grey), uncommon (green) and rare (blue), make it just rare and epic (purple), so in hotdrops this gun wouldn't make people super angry.


What do y'all think about it? I really hate vaults because it means taking off options for different loadouts making the game worse and boring, so my suggestion would make the Infantry Rifle be like a Scoped AR, just a few people use it but the Scoped AR don't make people angry because the chances of getting one is relatively low

Omega/Carbide challenges could return exactly the same. Reach a certain level in the season. Nothing more, nothing less. Will go away at the end of S8 so it would be a ""Last Chance"" type of deal. Original owners could get like 2000 V-Bucks for unlocking the lights in S4 (1000 for carbide 1000 for omega) or the RGB colors people have suggested so that PC players can match with their keyboard. Add in challenges that allow the Pickaxe to change colors and you have a nice little return bundle.

Hello. My paintence has broke. I am player from Season 4. I started playing around June 18th 2018 (Season 4). In 3 days I bought battle Pass when week 8 came out. I had around 20 days to get Level 80. I had a life and I was total noob. It was hard. I have saw that every one is talking about Omega Lights. They are cool and I want them. In Last day of Season 4 I got Level 63 and oh boi how I was grinding in last days and spending v-bucks just to get Omega. In my thoughts it is the best Battle Pass Tier 100 skin in all fortnite. I am so pissed that Fortnite is not bringing back challenges. All seasons that HAD edit options had all time style challenges (Except for Season 4) and it is sad that my favorite skin that I grinded days and Nights. The sleep that I didn't have just to get Omega.I was hoping to get at least Level 65 in last 20 hours that I didn't got and lost sleep. It would be great to get these challenges I love color green and Of course I have no lights for Omega.

How to make these challenges

1. Give banner, 1000 V-Bucks and free Omega dance , Omega glider and rainbow omega light for people who completed all challenges in S4 (Omega and Carbide challenges)
2. To get lights outlive 25K Enemies (Omega challenges)
3. To get lights outlive 10K Enemies (Carbide challenges)
4. Give every Omega owner Omega Glider (Like apoligy for this)
5. Don't have end time of these challenges (Omega and Carbide challenges)
6. Give each Omega and Carbide owner 150 V-Bucks for 1 Completed challenge in S4

Omega Challenges

* {S4 Get Lvl 25} NEW - Outlive 1K Enemies
* {S4 Get Lvl 35} NEW - Outlive 2.5K Enemies
* {S4 Get Lvl 45} NEW - Outlive 5K Enemies
* {S4 Get Lvl 55} NEW - Outlive 12.5K Enemies
* \[S4 Get Lvl 80} NEW - Outlive 25K Enemies
* Pickaxe - Complete 3 challenges

Carbide challenges

* {S4 Get Lvl 10} NEW - Outlive 500 Enemies
* {S4 Get Lvl 20} NEW - Outlive 1K Enemies
* {S4 Get Lvl 30} NEW - Outlive 2.5K Enemies
* {S4 Get Lvl 40} NEW - Outlive 7.5K Enemies
* {S4 Get Lvl 65} NEW - Outlive 15K Enemies
* Pickaxe - Complete 3 challenges

It would be wonderful so please Epic do this!

Yes, it had guns which made it fun to use on people and mostly go through builds. The gun was hard to aim at people because they would be so small and you'll have to damage your vehicle to deal damage pretty much. Once people started crying for it to be vaulted and also begging for likes, Fortnite nerfed it to where you couldn't go through builds, which was the most fun part. It was part of the challenges so Fortnite wouldn't just vault it but people cried anyways. It's the same way with the Ice Legion. They had challenges, they were limited time, but people still cried for vaulting. Once the event was over people went back to crying about Planes and Boom boxes. Pretty much the only thing that survived from season 7 is the infantry rifle, which isn't very good at all and is a weapon that actually needs vaulting for improvements and not just because people say it's bad. Epic should do what they think is right and not listen to a bunch of people who beg for likes and follow after streamers and constantly post it whenever Epic shows something on Twitter.",FortNiteBR

More than any other game I have ever played, and usually its because I die in unfair ways. First and foremost, smgs need to be fucking nerfed. I can't count how many times I'm spraying an ar in a guy's face for about ten seconds and he pulls out and smg and I'm dead in two seconds. He should have been dead long before he was able to pull out an smg with a god damn assault rifle stuck down his throat, but no, this game allows people with smgs to win automatically. Fucking bullshit. Smgs need some serious bloom adjustments because when I'm spraying a god damn ak 47 in to a guys mouth he shouldnt be able to pull out an smg and immediately kill me with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are the devs of this game even doing. ONe week you can't find a scar anywhere, the next week literally everyone in the game has a scar. Wtf? And don';t get me started on ar bloom. How is it that I will miss 20 fucking shots and then the guy lazers me for 150 health in 3 shots. Where was the bloom at when I was firing? AM I just put on a lower priority because I play and switch, and thus the server  just decides I lost? Because there is no other rhyme or reason for it. I shoot an entire clip and it hits the guy once, then he shoots 3 shots and I'm dead. There is no skill involved in that, its all luck, and its bullshit. I want to be able to lazer guys in 3 shots 2 but since I'm on switch and sub 30fps aim assist doesn't do a fucking thing for me. Fucking bullshit.

&amp;#x200B;

Spam building needs to be taken out of the game. Turbo building is the most bullshit pussy maneuvber in a fight. You can't fucking hit the guy because he spam builds for 20 minutes, then he somehow manages to lazer you in 3 shots and you lost the fight, when you had every advantage! HOW?! HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?! And I've pretty much given up on using shotguins in a fight. Half the time my shots are just ghost shots and I end up dying even though I clearly shot the enemy. It makes no fucking sense at all. This game is a piece of shit. Half the thigns its advertised as doing don't even work right! It's not about who is best at fighting its about who is best at building and who gets the better bloom rng, which never happens to be switch players. Even mobile has auto aim and even auto shoot! Why don't I have those options on the switch?!

 I'm being put into cross platform lobbies with people dropping 10+ kills every single game. a month ago it wasn't like that, so I'm sure there is cross platform and its complete bullshit. Ps4 and xbox 1 have twice the frames and computing power, and pcs can have up to 240, and mobile players have the strongest aim assist in the game and auto fire; and I'm supposed to be pitted against these players on a system that can't even run 30 fps and has the worst aim assist of any version of the game. How the fuck is that fair? That's like stepping up to the plate with a bat half the size of a normal bat. That's like playing basketball against ten foot tall amazon women. That's like taking a mazda civic to a nascar race. That's fucking BULLSHIT. And it should be corrected and we should be put back into our own lobbies. I don't care if I have to wait another 30 seconds to get a game if it won't be against these sweaty build fags who build like they injected meth into their testicles just before I came into their line of sight. 

I'm so sick of unfair bullshit in this game. Unfair rng and bloom is enough, but when I am forced to go against players who have many advantages over me its starts to really piss me off. I paid a lot of money to these developers and they can't even give me a product that works the way its supposed to, and pit me against black belts in fortnite when the highest I can ever be on my system is a brown belt. It's unfair and its bad business. I'm tired of having the odds stacked against me simply because I play on the switch. I want to know who in their right mind thought that it was a good idea to lump all of the servers together, because it totally fucked up the game and made it damn near impossible to enjoy. Every time I get perfect loot, some fucking sweater comes along and lazers me from 200 meters away before I can even see them on my screen, then rushed in and kills me and takes all my loot. This happens over and over again, and a month ago, that wasn't the case. Why epic. Why do you fuck us nintendo players over? You got something against nintendo? Because we deserve the same respect and care as any of the other players who play your god forsaken fucking shit hole of a game. Fix this shit. Lower the texture quality on switch so I can have some frames or something. Put switch players back into switch exclusiv e lobbies! I don't even play duos or squads because I get killed so fast by people on other systems that its just an exercise in frustration. A game is supposed to be fun, not rage inducing and violence promoting. Your game makes me want to beat the shit out of it with a baseball bat. DO SOMETHING! -Nerf the fucking smgs so they aren't a fucking lazer that kills in 2 seconds. That is just so enraging. totally unfair. Make your game fair please. I'm tired of feeling like I'm riding on the short bus of fortnite just because I play on switch. I paid 300 dollars for the god damn system, and I've seen it play games beautifully. Yours should be no exception. You're pissing a lot of people off and making yourself look bad, not nintendo. How can the best game in the world be such a piece of shit when you look at it closely? It makes no sense.

 Please, do something. I don't know how much more of this I can take. I'm at the end of my rope here. I want to physically hurt people and break things because of how shitty these things I mentioned are. If your customers are raging, like you've seen vids of on youtube, that should be a red flag that your game is seriously fucked up and needs attention. Stop making snowman suits and make it so that when I shoot my bullets actually hit what I'm shooting at instead of going literally everywher but where my crosshair is. If I can't hit a guy why can he hit me? It makes no logical sense and its anti competitive. BLoom is horrible and needs to be either heavily tweaked or removed altogether for something like what csgo has, where skill is what puts your bullets where they are, not rng and blind luck. That would be a good start. Fix my aim assist on switch, fix my frames, make the game fun again. Its not fun anymore, it just pisses me off when I play it. It's going to make me have a nervous breakdown and I'm going to sue you for it, I swear to god. Mark my words, if I have a mental breakdown because fortnite is broken, you are getting sued epic. Fix my damn game.",FortNiteBR

BUT, finishing a downed player has always been considered toxic, now, it‚Äôs very understandable, but nethertheless, annoying! 

So how would people feel about, in squads and duos, getting half from the knock and the second half for the full kill? 

I feel this will at least help and probably makes more sense? Especially for those playing solo squads

I got this idea from the riddle of the third teaser of season 8, where it said fight beasts of fire and ash. The eruption will basically cause rocks to shoot out of the volcano and fall down all over the island, similar to the kevin portal and the ice storm fog.

Imo i think that zombies are annoying but theyre just a thing that gives the game a spin on how the game works. What i think they should do is just give em a different model, make some different ""lava zombies"" like a flying one that dive bombs you etc. And if theyre gonna bring some new challenges like last time, please make it so that it isnt as hard as they were or make it last longer for people who havent done em yet.
 
Anyway this is just a theory i made up, hope you guys like it, ik its long but thats what i thought of.

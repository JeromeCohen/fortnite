&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Supply Llama
&gt; Decreased material stacks from 500 to 200 per resource.

&amp;nbsp;

Gaining 1500 mats for free is an incredibly huge game changer if you're low on mats or in the early game. I'm certain EPIC's intentions with the llama was to make a rare and awesome looking easter egg treat, rather than the huge power spike and potential get out of jail free card that it was when it gave 1500.

&amp;nbsp;

A llama in the early/mid game gives too much of a resource spike, as well as a huge snowball potential; It takes a certain amount of time to gather resources (whether you farm or kill the farmers). How would you feel if you/your team finished looting weapons and just started power farming resources when, suddenly, you get engaged by another individual/team with +1500 mats?

&amp;nbsp;

Getting a llama in the late game doesn't make as much of an impact as most people would have sufficient mats already. 

600 mats (not counting any additional potions) for free, simply for being at the right place at the right time, is not as impactful while still retaining that +Nice Get! feeling.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; **Floor loot** materials adjusted

&gt; Material drop chances in **floor loot** reduced by 33%.

&gt; Material stack sizes in **floor loot** reduced by 33%.

&amp;nbsp;

Keyword is floor loot. You ever get utterly kerb stomped by a lucky dude that bum rushes you after hitting the very first chest after landing? Yeah, reducing the floor loot means that you have a bit more time to get a weapon, if you happen to land on a roof top without a chest, as the bum rushers will actually have to spend time farming mats. 

&amp;nbsp;

Completely unrelated news; how 2 get EZ kills

-land on roof w chest. 

-bum rush neighbor with hole in the roof by building to it.

-shoot the weaponless^(50% of the time, every time) lad. 

-gg ez, git gud, utterly outplayed &amp; out-thunk. 3000iq.

&amp;nbsp;

Contrary to popular ~~crybaby whining~~ belief, overall you lose very little resources from the floor loot nerf, as the vast majority of mats gathered within a game are from **farming** (not affected by the latest patch) as opposed to mats from chests/ natural spawn.


Again, like the llama nerf, this was to prevent early game RNG resource spikes and snowballing. 


tl;dr: The material nerfs reduce early game RNG resource spikes and snowballing. This is a good thing.",FortNiteBR

This is going to be a long, rambling show of my attempt at contribution.  Feel free to point out my many inconsistencies and mistakes which I’m sure will follow.  This was also written to an inspirational playlist on spotify so I might randomly lose the ability to write decent English while I’m inspired.  

QUICK TIPS:
To begin with, work on your landing.  Arguably the most important of a game is not dying right at the start.  Mainly because if it carries on happening you get mad and [this happens](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=broken+xbox+one+controller&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=hsOCfuHsqrNO4M%253A%252CJRBnGcDi8jZx3M%252C_&amp;usg=__1tppoW6hNp2vNau61qAQkHUaNhI%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjggeyT29LbAhXKB8AKHUFEDlYQ9QEIPDAC#imgrc=hsOCfuHsqrNO4M:).  So, the biggest thing is, if someone lands on a roof before you DO NOT LAND THERE.  You will almost certainly die, unfortunately we’re not in the good times where you could pickaxe someone with a gun anymore.  If someone lands on top of a house, drop to the bottom or glide away peacefully.  Your main aim should be to get a shotgun (which you cannot obtain from a chest).  Sometimes dropping to the bottom of a house and working up to the chest is actually better, because of the chance of getting a shotgun

If you’re playing for wins – Drop somewhere on the cliffs of the map.  Gradually move in with the circle if you aren’t confident at shooting or go to the middle of each circle and build a big base.  Only problem with this is that you will probably get pushed, so be prepared for that.  This will probably be boring, even if you get to the end there’s still a high chance you’ll come up against bob the builder who will build himself a 4 story castle in -1 seconds.  

If you want to get better – Drop tilted, or somewhere else popular, for example salty springs.  I’d recommend Salty, you’ll run into people and develop key gun skills, but won’t get shot in the back every few seconds.  Carry on dropping here and gradually you’ll build up skills in building and fighting.  [This video showcases it well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cer5lQjFlD4), look at the difference between Luke at the beginning and at the end.

GET MATERIALS – Arguably materials are the best thing to have in this game.  Building is key to becoming a solid (or even average) player, so make sure you have enough materials.  Material collecting is even more important after the recent material drop nerf(no comment).  It lets you spam build to protect yourself if you get shot, which is essential.  As Sypher says, if you get shot 3 times without building, you deserve to die.  That’s how important it is.


GENERAL ADVICE:
For newer players(who want to learn to build): For a few games start to land wailing / moisty to gather wood and practice building - both defensive (1by1s) and aggressive (double staircases with walls in front of each stair case). Take a few games to really help your muscle memory down. This game isn’t worth playing if you don’t have BASIC building skills. You don’t need to win build fights. You do need to be able to defend yourself.  As said earlier, if you’re shot, just start building, you can med up and peek/run when you’ve got cover.

For everyone: Go watch streamers to learn how to edit. It’s tough to learn yourself during fights if you’ve never done it. While the streamers will help you, you also need to just practice it yourself, to get that muscle memory.  This is a helpful visualisation created by u/moshimaster18 (thanks for that!) - https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/84pqns/3x3_editing_will_put_the_pyramid_piece_to_good/

To defend against grenade launchers - For defence against grenade launchers(the harder of the two): push. Continue building staircases in front of you while you push, because the closer you get to your opponent who’s shooting them the more ineffective they become(this tip also works when pushing someone with an AR).  Spamming walls won’t work because they’ll eventually take an odd bounce and kill / damage you, additionally, it blocks you from being able to push forwards.  Make sure, when you’re pushing though, that you’re blocked from Ars or sniper shots, so they can’t just laser you.  

For defence against rockets: spam walls. Make sure you’re building walls to your right / left, the splash damage is usually what gets you. RPGs are easily blockable from a distance, its when you get close that they’re an issue.  My advice is to either stick in a tower and try and get some damage, or push hard(next paragraph).  If you’re staying in a tower, remember, they have to peek out to shoot rockets.  You can use this small window to try hit a snipe or some AR shots, which will make them a lot more cautious when peeking again.  


For defence against rocker: pushing.  If you choose to push, BUILD,  Splash damage will get you if you are not constantly protecting yourself.  This often means blocking yourself in and editing up.  This is definitely a higher skill move and not one I would advie to newer and less confident players.  Remember, when you are on the floor they will always hit something, the ground, buildings or you.  You want to try and get above them.  Here it is a lot harder for them to hit you, unless they get a direct shot.  At this point, with the high ground, you have the advantage.


For endgame: if you down a player in duos / squads, you need to push. If yo aren’t confident, think logically the best option will likely be to push anyway.  Generally, a player will be devoted to reviving, so you’ll be in a 4v2 situation (in squads).  Use this to your advantage, even if you are on low health you will not die instantly, so anyone who goes DBNO can be revived after the fight.  

If you’re dying in build fights, go watch the replay and see if there was ever a time that you could have snuck in a few AR or shotgun shots. I can guarantee there were a few that you ended up building instead (even though your opponent probably still had their map out). Stop building just to build and be more aggressive. Don’t be afraid to drop down and blow it all out either.  If you are playing a bob the builder/john wick combo, this is probably one of your best options.  

If you want to get kills/high kill games – Learn rotations.  Actually, drop tilted.  Then learn rotations.  Seriously, tilted will have the most kills early game in nearly every game.  However, the key to high kill games is rotations.  Look at the storm and work out where people have to run the furthest from, head there are you’ll almost certainly run into people trying to get in from the storm.  Furthering this point, look at the map for yourself, you don’t want to be trapped in the storm.  If this happens, you’re taking damage and also struggling to see anyone watching you.  

My hands hurt from typing this, I’m meant to be revising but good luck to all of you.  I’ll check back in here a bit later with any other tips I can think of.

Finally, if you want to check out the stream feel free to come by! I’m a console player, who knows the theory but doesn’t put it into practice.  However, I have very few people who watch, so anyone who does come in wanting help or advice will have my full attention!  Not going to be streaming today but tomorrow my exams end and I’ll be livestreaming a lot, so will hopefully be able to play with people or help them get better.  Good luck, just tell me if I missed anything!

Take for example, if an item were so rare that having it would ensure a win. While I am not directly saying so, the rarity of the weapons and their damage correlates to a higher chance of winning. As they are rarer, this cuts down the chance of a user finding them and effectively fighting a user who has one already. 

This argument doesn't make much sense to me as you didn't argue about the Scar and Famas vs the M16 and Burst rifle. Both of these guns are directly better than their lower rarity counterparts. 

&gt;\&gt; \*Having the pump shotgun with the ability to one shot players, was a balanced system. It allowed the skillful outplay and use of mechanical skills such as accuracy. \* 

I come from a past of Counter strike. Fortnite is a flick based shooter. This game is not ""very"" hard to aim in. The aiming is obviously there, but most guns are hitscan with pretty big crosshairs. Accuracy is not where the skill is based upon in this game, as it isn't very hard to be decent at aiming in a game like fortnite. I can tell you, since the pump nerf, I have won more shotgun fights. Outbuilding somebody, just for them to randomly flick up and get a lucky 220 damage to your head, was not balanced.

&gt;\&gt; The change to Explosion Radius again, is quite bad. Not to mention a single C4 can break 100\~ metal walls if placed correctly. As C4 does a total of 800 damage. For example, it approximately takes only FOUR (4) C4 to destroy the entire Main Tower building in Tilted. Seems quite overpowered in it’s current state. 

This change allowed C4 to have an actual use in the game. Even with this buff, C4 is not good enough to be carried around as a main slot weapon, over the other primary weapons. (AR, Shotty, Sniper, 2x shotty or 2 meds.) However, I do feel this change is currently balanced and shouldn't be changed. The item is now good enough to do it's job and have an effective use. In certain scenarios it would be the best choice, which is what it needs to be considered good.

&gt;\&gt; In the right hands, Clingers are quite broken. Have you ever found yourself boxed in due to a player taking high ground from you? Play the turtle tactic and try to make a move to outsmart them? Well unfortunately if you DO that, you are at an extreme disadvantage due to how clingers work with structures that can break. 

Turtling is not a ""tactic"". It's something a lot of players are forced to do, due to losing high ground. It shouldn't be something you are rewarded for. If someone get's high ground on you, so bad to the point where you essentially have to turtle, then you shouldn't be rewarded at all. High ground is the skill gap in this game. If you can't play for it you should be at a disadvantage. Sitting in a 1x1 should be a last option to survive. Not an option that allows you to spam build walls until your duo partner comes to save you.

&gt;\&gt; Players Phasing through Player Build Structures 

Completely agree about the phasing. This is the biggest issue in the game to me personally, and needs to be addressed. Regardless if it's being fixed, we have still yet to hear any word about it from Epic. That's unlike them, as they have usually been very vocal in the past about changes that the community wants.

&gt;\&gt; Material Nerf / Llama Nerf / Farmed Materials 

The nerf to explosive ammo was needed. The material nerf was not. I completely agree with a 20&amp;#37; buff to materials gained.

That's basically it, I myself am a good player. I think a lot of the points he made wouldn't be healthy for the structure of the game, or the future of it. I feel like Epic is currently on a decent track in terms of progression for the game, but they are taking some steps back in a few different aspects. Thank you for reading.",FortNiteBR

This week's location is Risky Reels, which already doesn't have much spots for chests anyways, and it's such a condensed area that it just leads to a quick death most of the time. I just really hope Epic tries something new for season 5 instead of  having phoned in challenges like this one. ",FortNiteBR

In terms of additions, updates, listening to the community and overall making the game better to play, they had been doing a great job of it.

But recently they've fallen off on the communications part, which has led to a host of problems. The recent few patches have been detrimental, leading to a host of problems. But the real problem has been them not communicating as much or even comparable to before. They had bad patches before as well, but they've been quick in either explaining or taking note of feedback, effectively communicating their ongoing efforts. So even if the changes hurt, people didn't get as upset as they are rn as they knew what epic was doing.

I'm sure even the recent changes have a lot of thought behind them, but they aren't coming out and explaining why they made them. Or if they weren't well received, they have been pretty tight lipped whereas before they would either make a statement or respond quickly. The current scoped ARs in sniper shootout is an example.

This is slightly concerning to me, personally, I've mostly supported all that epic have done till now, as I'm sure most of us have.

But this sudden decline in communication and noting of feedback is very concerning, especially considering the huge competition that fortnite is facing rn or will pretty soon. Realm royale, cod and battlefield br, just to name the bigger ones.

If there was ever a time to be open and responsive, epic, it's rn. We love you guys in the way you've mostly been handling the game and hope you deliver this time as well.

The preset visual graphics settings seem to be maxed out or at least definitely higher than low, this is unnecessary obviously because it's a handheld console. Fortnite on PC looks great regardless if you're running everything low or high. The game runs around 30fps and anyone coming from PC makes it very off-putting to play. Performance is key over sugar-coated graphics. I'm sure it's possible to hit 60fps if the game gets optimized properly. Also any future support for motion aiming and touch controls would be awesome.

1. I would make rocket lanuchers only be attainable by supply drops. Rocket Lanuchers are so good early game more so with the recent mat nerf.

2. Make it so that you need to caught you enemy in the explosion graphic to get the full damage. I made this change because you shouldn't take full damage if the rocket's explosion didn't actually touch.

• Llamas now drop 200 of each mat (before was 500). No more explosive ammo is dropped from llamas either. 

• Floor loot in terms of materials are reduced from 30 to 20. 

• ARs and other weapons now do more damage to structures. 

I personally think these changes are good, as people are now forced to actually spend time collecting resources say from trees now rather than just finding them laying around. 

Also, it makes C4 and the Minigun a LOT more useable in big build battles. 

Not to mention, when you ARE in a build battle, rockets and grenade launchers will have to be used more cautiously. 

The only possible issue I could see would be the AR spam on building causing people to run out of mats, which may have to be addressed but overall I like he new changes. 

The changes reward players who spend time harvesting resources and uses explosives correctly. It will have a negative affect on people who just run around looking for kills without thinking about their mats. 

Personally, I like the new changes. ",FortNiteBR

- Data mining is a big problem in Fortnite right now and has caused countless leaks
- The Blockbuster reward skin, ""The Visitor"", (which was recently leaked by data miners) is extremely disappointing due to the amount of grinding necessary to earn it
Now get your tinfoil hats on, because this is about to get real.
Here's my theory:
But what if data mining ISN'T a problem? 
Hear me out, it wouldn't be the craziest thing Epic has done...
We all know that data mining has been extremely easy with Fortnite, and the Epic devs obviously are aware of this as it has been going on for months now. Knowing this, what if Epic purposely put this (underwhelming) Visitor skin in the game files...which was MEANT to be found by data miners. What if the Visitor isn't REALLY the Blockbuster, and Epic just put it in the game files so we would be underwhelmed when the inevitable leak came out, only to have a different skin as the Blockbuster reward?

I like using double pump, it’s what I use for the large majority of my fights like everybody else. But Epic is apparently trying to make other guns actually worth something in the game so yes people will get the occasional double heavy, and that will be strong but heavies are much harder to find than pumps and everyone can double pump at this point. So if the pump is vaulted that will drastically reduce the amount of double shotguns in the game if the keep the current shotgun drop levels the same. And yes I’ll miss having the pump, and everyone will have to get used to running tac shotguns more often, which will almost completely get rid of the just build and jump around double pump fights. I know this isn’t gonna be a popular opinion, but if this happens this will definitely solve the majority of the problem while still leaving two different types of shotguns in the game for people to use.",FortNiteBR

And an arguement why.,"So, many people know that while Omega is unlocked at battle pass tier 100, what you can not buy is the outfits for him, those you have to be level 80 to get. 

Well, what many players might not realize is that season 4's level 80 is MUCH more difficult to achieve than season 3's by a large margin. 

 I played pretty leisurely over the course of season 3 and just managed to get the glider for wick the last 3 days. So I, like I'm sure many others have, assumed (a mistake IK) that the same amount of playtime would result in achieving everything because honestly I felt I played a healthy amount. 


Ok, so sucks to be me right? Well... Not exactly. If anything I've played MORE this season and I'm way behind XP wise. Meaning its likely many others are going to eventually catch on like I have, and get upset they stand no chance at getting the lights for omega. 


Now I'm certainly not going to suggest to lower the amount needed to achieve said goal. But perhaps for the last week, instead of unlocking 5k+ xp for a weekly reward for challenges, we get a 2x multiplier for XP to use for the end of the season. (Which at that point is less than a week away)  

It still makes it incredibly hard to achieve the full goal, but adds a bit of help at the end to assist those who really worked for it but didnt make it by a couple levels. 

Hell they could even only give it to players who did ALL the challenges. ",FortNiteBR

My suggestion is to come up with moderately difficult Daily Challenges that reward the user with V-Bucks. Some examples of this would be.

Kill 10 Enemies in a single Solo Match - 100 V-Bucks

Achieve 999 Materials of Wood, Brick, and Metal in a single Solo Match - 100 V-Bucks

Kill an enemy from 200+m - 50 V-Bucks

Just a rough idea, would be a great way to allow more people to earn more skins and emotes. ",FortNiteBR

I think Epic Games is slowly lowering the skill gap with overpowered and noob-friendly items. I feel like if Epic is gonna put an insanely large amount of money into e-sports for their game, they should make it a little more e-sports friendly. Don't get me wrong, I don't want fun stuff removed out of the game, shopping carts and jetpacks are so fun to mess around with. But, Jetpacks and Shopping Carts have no place on an E-Sports stage. Epic has such an amazing skill heavy game that e-sports would be perfect for, yet they add items every patch that cater to new players and less skilled ones. 

I believe Epic should add a Casual Mode, where all of the crazy wacky stuff they want to add is in, such as shopping carts, jetpacks ,stickies. In this mode Jetpacks don't have to be limited time, and they don't have to worry TOO much about balancing. Then there should be a competetive mode. I know Epic doesn't want to add one of those modes so you don't have to. Just take away all of the overbalanced and crazy things such as Jetpacks, Shopping Carts, Port-a-Forts out so all of the higher skilled and more competetive oriented players can play without all of the ""fun"" stuff. 

This way, newer and fun seeking players can experience the fun of the cartoony and wacky Fortnite without bothering higher skilled or competetive players. Also with this way, Epic can avoid adding a Skill Based MMR mode of which they said they aren't going to add.

Tell me what you guys think :) ",FortNiteBR

My example will be from anarchy since I have landed there hundreds of times and have a solid grasp on the loot there.

So, looting half of anarchy would give you about 3-4 stacks of material and about 4-5 chests. I am going to use 3 and 5 as the numbers since that makes things easier. So pre nerf, those 3 stacks would give you 90 material. Post nerf, those 2 stacks would give you 40. The 5 chest would give you 150 material pre nerf and 100 material post nerf.

Now loosing 100 material is not a huge deal since it is only about 2 to 4 trees depending on which ones you farm. But it adds up shortly. 

Assuming one other solo lands there and he looks the other half of anarchy. If you kill him without either of you building, you are now out 200 materials. The 100 you lost to the nerf, and the 100 he lost to the nerf. Again, 200 isn't the end of the world but suddenly, it is going to add some significant time to your farming.

Finally, you leave anarchy and run into another player who is similar to you. He looted half a location and killed the player who looted the other half. He is also out 200 materials from the mat Nerf. One of you wins the duel and collects all the loot. Not even factoring in all the material that you used in the battle (which build battles can take anywhere from 100 to 500 materials per person) 
Just because of the material nerf, the winner of this battle has 3 kills and is out 400 materials only because of the nerf, and the more players you kill. The higher this number grows. 

The conclusion is, this nerf only hits people who go for kills and build. The nerf does not significantly affect a player until it gets compounded with looting other players. Wether this nerf is good or bad depends on your playstyle but it should be known this nerf was very significant and large.",FortNiteBR

The match length in blitz was so convenient. I could play a game in the morning on weekdays. I could get a quick game in before going out. If I lost, it wasn't a big deal since I had only really lost 10 minutes.


There was always people to fight in blitz, most campers died early.

Now in solos I have to spend 10 minutes looting and farming to ensure I don't die early. If I lose its usually because I ran out of materials because everyone I kill has none.

Blitz was much more fun than a regular solo, just make it permanent.

However, I've had an idea for a while that mats should regenerate 10 per second (one mat type at a time) up to some low limit like 50 of each. 

In my opinion, this change would do a lot of things to help gameplay and widen the skill gap. First, it would promote more building and less farming early game. Second, you would always be able to do *something,* even if it's not much, when you are out of materials and your opponent isn't. Some will say, ""it's your fault for not farming!"" But the reality is that your mats is mainly down to randomness, because the people you kill could have anywhere from 0-2k mats and this number doesn't strongly correlate with their skill. Third, it would make kills slightly more rewarding, given that it drastically reduces the chance that the people you kill have 8 mats on them total. Finally, it wouldn't remove the need for farming, given that a stockpile of 150 mats with a regen rate of one piece per second won't be nearly enough to get you through a build fight.

The pump. 

I suggested in a thread somewhere to make the pump, if fired already, queue the pump animation, so if switched back to you have to preform the pump action before shooting again. However switching from pump to pump that are reloaded and ready to go you can maintain the high burst damage. 

This turns the double pump from a spammy high burst damage EXPLOIT, into a high burst damage ABILITY with a COOLDOWN. 

I was met with responses that told me this is how it worked before and it caused some sort of game breaking bug or something of that caliber. 

If it seriously cannot be coded this way, I bring to you a new suggestion. 

1. Vault the pump action shotgun. 

2. Release a new double barrel shotgun.

This double barrel shotgun can be fired off with the current pump damage at the speed of the double pump, but then has  to be reloaded (like an RPG) when switched back to before firing it again. 

Concerns:

Even if players wanted to stack the double barrel, it takes the high burst damage capability down from 10 shots before a reload is necessary, to 4 shots, and hopefully reverting the changes to materials in llamas and as floor loot. 

Im sure we can all agree that running out of mats because every player you kill has less than you did before engaging them, is more devastating than facing the double pump, and currently both of these things are an issue...

Just my two cents on the subject, hopefully you all can agree, if you disagree post your concerns in the comments and I’ll try to update the post under the concerns section. 

TLDR;
Add queue to pump animation for fired shotguns, or vault the pump and make a double barrel. ",FortNiteBR

It’s a building game. It’s what made you different than ANY other BR and part of the reason for the HUGE success. Now you’re reducing the material gain and making the game stale and boring? 

If anything, from the recent Blitz mode, you should increase resource gain if anything, not decreasing. 

Having to farm for 10 minutes early game to have a chance of winning is ridiculous. The game should not be that boring.

The gain in materials would justify the Llama nerf and the stacks of 20 you get. 

If you want to cater the game to new players, maybe introduce practice mode so they can practice their building? Hell, 50v50 is essentially practice mode. But guess what? You reduced the material gain in that. 

It’s ridiculous. In order to have a good chance of winning, you must farm for at least 5 minutes at the bare minimum or you need to get lucky that you killed a guy with 500+ materials. ",FortNiteBR

The game is free, no one asked you to buy the skins and Epic never promised that they were transferable anyway. This level of vitriol is insanely toxic. Especially towards a company that has listened and worked hard on offering everything they could to your whiny disrespectful attitudes.

So what im proposing is that exactly 9pm  EST everyone queue up in a solo game and land at the soccer field.

Also it will be easier to find other in game if we go on the oceania server (you can change your server in option menu). So its similar to the ceremony we did for tilted/dusty depot.

Started playing in Season 1, and fell in love ever since.

I only bring up those statistics to give those who read this a general idea of how much time I’ve spent playing the game, and the passion I have for it. This way the things I am going to suggest don’t seem to come out of nowhere, or from a player in the community who does not have as much game knowledge.

First off, I absolutely love this game. Fortnite has been such a booming success. Not only is it going to be a competitive game, but a fun game as well. There’s a reason players return who often complain of changes that completely flip the meta, or players who talk badly of the game. The game has something to it that shouldn’t be let go. * Fluidity* .

————

First off to talk about : Shotgun Damage.

Epic recently made some adjustments to the Pump Shotgun, and Tac Shotgun. 

Pump Shotgun
* Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0
* Damage reduced from 90/95 to 80/85

Tactical Shotgun
* Headshot multiplier reduced from 2.5 to 2.0

Not only did the pump receive a nerf on the Headshot damage, BUT it received an overall damage nerf as well.
Prior to this change, I can confidently tell you there was not many reasons to pick up a Tactical Shotgun, after the nerf of it as well, there are even less reasons to use it. Understandably, the rarities of the weapons now fit their damage values accordingly, but then again, balance is lost here.

————

Due to the changes, the pump shotgun now does a maximum of these damages :

Uncommon Pump Shotgun (Green) : Headshot Max Damage (160HP)

Rare Pump Shotgun (Blue) : Headshot Max Damage (170HP)

While the tactical does :

Common Tactical Shotgun (White) : Headshot Max Damage (134)

Uncommon Tactical Shotgun (Green) : Headshot Max Damage (140)

Rare Tactical Shotgun (Blue) : Headshot Max Damage (148)

Lastly the Heavy Shotgun does : 

Epic Heavy Shotgun (Purple) : Headshot Max Damage (183)

Legendary Heavy Shotgun (Gold) : Headshot Max Damage (192)

————

The issue with these changes is the buff given to Heavy Shotguns. Take for example, if an item were so rare that having it would ensure a win. While I am not directly saying so, the rarity of the weapons and their damage correlates to a higher chance of winning. As they are rarer, this cuts down the chance of a user finding them and effectively fighting a user who has one already. In example : 

Player 1 with 150 Health, is fighting Player 2 with 200 Health. This is a CQC fight and relies heavily on shotgun plays. Player 1 has a White Tactical shotgun, while Player 2 has a Legendary Heavy Shotgun.

The chances of Player 1 killing Player 2 with the shotgun he currently has is zero. While Player 2 has a much higher chance of one shotting Player 1.

*Having the pump shotgun with the ability to one shot players, was a balanced system. It allowed the skillful outplay and use of mechanical skills such as accuracy. *

Lastly, Ghost shots are quite upsetting. Recently it appears that players who are mechanically inclined and quick with playing, are being punished by shots not registering. They show on client side although don't apply any damage server side.

============

Trap Damage.

Oddly enough I for one am very conscious as to where I am running and walking in buildings due to traps. Although the hot-and-cold changes of damages has actually introduced a new meta in higher end gameplay. Not only did Trap Damage get buffed, although actuation time was also entirely reduced. This way traps engage immediately and can damage a player quite fast. That I have no issue with. Although 150 damage is quite a lot. Prior, 75 was too little. A even mid point should be 100. This allows players with shields a fighting chance, and makes trap plays for early game useful as well, but not overly useful. Not often will players be at 200 health off drop, most will be 150. This way counterplay can also be made.

============

C4 Damage.

I don’t often see C4 used in game as some changes were made and build fights don’t happen as often. C4 prior to ANY changes was quite useless I can agree. The first buff was a large step. The changes made were :

* Damage through walls. The C4 explosion now does damage in the entire explosion distance.
* Explosion Radius updated to 400.
* Distance thrown doubled.
* Delay between throwing explosives reduced from 0.25 to 0.175 seconds.
* Delay before detonating after throwing reduced from 0.75 to 0.15 seconds.

Prior to this, C4’s stats were(correct me if I’m wrong please) :

* No Damage through walls, Only damage walls that can be seen on a flat surface. (Explosion damage not 3 Dimensional)
* Explosion Radius was 200.
* Distance thrown approximately 10m~.
* Delay between throwing explosives 0.25 seconds.
* Delay before detonating thrown explosives 0.75 seconds.

Currently C4 Stats are stated :

* Damage through walls. The C4 explosion now does damage in the entire explosion distance.
* Explosion Radius updated to *600*.
* Distance thrown doubled.
* Delay between throwing explosives reduced from 0.25 to 0.175 seconds.
* Delay before detonating after throwing reduced from 0.75 to 0.15 seconds.

————

The change to Explosion Radius again, is quite bad. Not to mention a single C4 can break 100~ metal walls if placed correctly. As C4 does a total of 800 damage. For example, it approximately takes only FOUR (4) C4 to destroy the entire Main Tower building in Tilted. Seems quite overpowered in it’s current state. My suggested adjustments would be :

* Remove Damage through walls. Explosion Radius does not do damage through walls. (2 dimensional explosion based on surface)
* Explosion Radius updated to 300.
* Delay between throwing explosives returned to 0.25 seconds.
* Delay before detonating after throwing reduced from 0.75 to 0.45 seconds.

===========

Clinger Adjustment

In the right hands, Clingers are quite broken. Have you ever found yourself boxed in due to a player taking high ground from you? Play the turtle tactic and try to make a move to outsmart them? Well unfortunately if you DO that, you are at an extreme disadvantage due to how clingers work with structures that can break.

In the Fortnite Patch notes 3.6 it clearly states that :

*Clinger added.
* Will detonate early if a structure it is attached to is destroyed. *

This means, if you throw a clinger onto an enemy players wall that is exposed to them and the clinger on both sides, and shoot said wall until it breaks. The player inside WILL take 100 damage no matter what. Meaning that when a player is turtling, having clingers on hand means you have no work to do getting in, or forcing them out with other means of pressure.

An adjustment to this would be that the clinger falls off of the structure broken. It is a suction cup after all. This would balance the clinger as you can already stick them to players which ensures 100 damage.*

============

Shotgun Inconsistency.

Shotguns aren’t as inconsistent as we feel or think. I mean they are, but there’s reasons we’re hitting 9 damage with shots that appear to be “on target”. Desync and Random Pellet Spreads play a part in this.

Fortnite uses a system where the pellets are randomized. From what I know they are technically “centralized” but after many shotgun shots I have fired into the sky and screenshots taken, I can assure you this doesn’t seem so. Here’s an idea of how shotguns are in TF2 :

https://i.redditmedia.com/godo2fOdwZkFYjf5uJlPCm8ViCKXSRtGS50TtHMozNY.jpg?w=972&amp;s=10220303d78791114cc05076dc577e2f

The pellet spread on the left is how we have shotgun spreads currently. This means you can be on target and completely miss pellets that can give that extra 10, 20, and other damage. If we were to go forward and test a “Fixed” pellet spread of the 9 pellet square / cone, I feel that it could help alleviate some issues felt with shotguns. This way they feel more consistent with the players accuracy. This, plus the reverting of the shotgun damage changes could potentially fix current feelings of inconsistency.

————

Players Phasing through Player Build Structures

This is a huge gripe for those who play at a higher tier and want to pursue the competitive play that will inevitably come to Fortnite. If I recall this was not an issue in the past prior to 4.0 update and Season 4.
Often players build fighting, will come through my walls, stairs, or even floors when attempting to block them off and gain high ground. From some quick research, it appears that players with lesser connections, or higher ping (Let’s say 120ms~ on NA East) are able to phase through the walls of others. While it appears to be a disadvantage for those who have bad ping, it’s quite the advantage in build fights.

————

Material Nerf / Llama Nerf / Farmed Materials

As of recent Llamas were nerfed. Rockets removed, and mat’s lowered. While I do agree 1500 was quite a bit for getting a llama which in Solos/Duos and even Squads could be a game changer. That’s half of the max materials you can carry. While on the other hand, it gave 500 metal. Which is 50 metal walls worth of building. Putting together a base and setting up on high ground with that type of building material makes it rough for other teams to push. Personally I believe the materials given from a llama should scale from game mode. 

Solos are : 200 Wood / 100 Brick / 0 Metal.
Duos are : 300 Wood / 200 Brick / 100 Metal.
Squads are : 300 Wood / 300 Brick / 200 Metal.

While some may argue it is difficult to find a llama, for those who survive to late game, loot often trickles down the players onto the last alive. Which can carry over from anyone. 100 Players, and a relatively small map means 3 llamas are an easy find.

Overall material gathering should be buffed to 25% of it's normal gather rate.

————

Ground material nerf.

Unsure why this was even changed.

————

Farming materials. 

Did anyone play Season 2? Remember those vibrant, yellow-green pine trees that gave 50 wood per? Those were the trees to farm, not the big broccoli trees. Well that’s changed. Some of the items in the game that can be farmed for materials should be balanced, or buffed. I don’t believe everyone should be able to easily get 999 of each material like in Blitz, although I DO believe the normal game mode’s farming is far too low. Possibly buff it by 20% entirely?

&gt; Building Adjustments 
We are making the following changes to address a few top concerns, including: Rocket Launcher and Grenade Launcher dominance in the late game, Minigun effectiveness, and overall resource availability. We will be closely monitoring these changes when they are live to assess the impact and re-adjust as necessary.

Here's the problem: RPGs and Grenade Launchers end game are now completely unstoppable due to the resource nerf. Nerfing the 20 rockets in a llama was probably a smart move anyway, but how does that address end game dominance for these weapons? It wouid've been nice to hear some type of explanation because saying one thing and then reacting in opposition does nothing for your credibility as a ""transparent game company.""

These changes break any confidence I have that you are capable of balancing this game, recognizing what the players like and don't like, and ability to test your changes. Balancing a shooter is hard work, mainly because making one change can have very dramatic effects on very unrelated components of the game. Anyone who has played shooters knows that balance is difficult. The reason your change is so concerning is because these are TWO RELATED ""concerns"" and you didn't address RPG and Grenade Launcher dominance at all, and nerfed the only defense against the said ""dominant"" weapons into the ground. Any moron could recognize that such a severe nerf to materials would be a HUGE buff to explosives. ESPECIALLY END GAME.

Building is essential to this game, especially when TTK is so short and you have OP explosive weapons. It's also the only thing that makes this game fun to me. Without building (or poorly implemented building), this game isn't really that great. With building, it's incredible. Quit fucking with building and materials. Focus on your shitty gun mechanics because that is the area of the game that needs balance and change.",FortNiteBR

We’ve been working hard with each iteration of 50v50 to get closer to our ideal vision of massive full-scale combat, and as part of that, we've made changes to the Storm in v3.  We wanted to encourage more players to arrive at the final battleground sooner, but unfortunately, the changes caused spikes in server load above what it could handle invisibly.

The servers keep track of something called “player relevancy”, which means all of the players around you that you could interact with.  The range for that relevancy is very close to the radius of the first circle in 50v50, which means if you’re near the center the server is trying to process information for everyone in the game.  This scales quadratically, so for every 
**n** players inside that range we process **n squared** relevancies.

We’re seeing almost double the remaining players once the Storm has closed down in v3 compared to v2.  Doubling the remaining players means 4x the server relevancy load, which is why you’re seeing most of the “lag” right as the first circle closes.  We’re working very hard on some tech breakthroughs to allow us to get closer to our vision, but unfortunately, they’re just not ready yet.


To help alleviate the issues, we're reverting our Storm size and timing changes back to how they were during v2 of this LTM. Here are the changes we’re making:

**Storm circle 1**

* Radius from 35000 to 20000
* Time to close from 6 minutes to 10 minutes

**Storm circle 2**

* Radius from 15000 to 5000

**Storm circle 3**

* Radius from 5000 to 0

**Storm circle 4 has been removed.**

We'll continue to monitor your feedback and the state of 50v50.

You have to have some level of confidence in yourself and go in with the mindset that you can beat every person you go against. Focus on winning your battles. Most people focus on the Victory Royales but those will come when you start to win your battles. Analyse what’s causing you to die. Is it your aim? Practice hitting your shots. Don’t spam the shoot button but get your aim on target and then pull.  Above all just realize, if you die, you have unlimited tries. You can queue up within 30 seconds and be in another game.

- Teammate stands to one side of a ramp going to the main spot we're at, then edits the floor out from under 3-10 teammates so they fall and die.

- Teammates literally running away while downed as we frantically try to build around them to keep them in place only to have them keep running away and bleed out.

- Teammate drops a Port A Fort in front of me as I'm heading towards loot they want so I go up and they get the shit I need (when we all just dropped and they had weapons while my squad and I had zero).

- Teammates destroying the bottom of all built structures when we have high ground advantage, dropping half a dozen or more teammates to their death.

What's going on with all this? Has something changed in the Meta or something where players are bored and don't give a shit? Or is it just that 50 faceless teammates makes people not give a shit and just rather fuck around and let others do the work?",FortNiteBR

3) The shotguns are not the most consistent and get annoying. In my opinion they have landed in almost a perfect spot. It makes no sense why a purple and gold shotgun is out done by lesser tier shotguns. I love the heavy and I actually enjoy picking it up now.

Fortnite has 2 main mechanics and it’s building and combat. Clearly what sets Fortnite apart from other games is the building. One thing I can not stand is when people complain about material count. Materials are supposed to be scarce because building requires strategy. There’s not much skill behind holding down the mini gun or spamming rockets/GL but you can still get kills; and with that, there’s not much skill behind spam building but it can still save you/get kills. Now, have you noticed in Blitz or any LTM with increased materials the complete waste of materials by some players making some kills go from taking 5 seconds to maybe 60? Yes they did prolong their death, but it’s obvious when someone is spam building and not building strategically and they have an inevitable death because they don’t know what they are doing. INCREASED MATERIALS CATERS TO THE NOOBS, NOT THE AVID FORTNITE PLAYER. Building should require strategy and planning, not mashing buttons in order to confuse people, waste all your materials so none dropped on death, and then die not even able to put up a fight. Lower material counts teaches players to know when to build, what to build, and time management when looting. IF YOU WANT MATERIALS, SPEND THE TIME MINING OR KILL PEOPLE TO LOOT THEIR MATERIALS. The game is focused on skill and strategy, let’s keep it that way. ",FortNiteBR

Some people (my best friend included) say it takes no skill to 1 pump somebody and its ridiculous.  I personally would argue that while it may not be the hardest thing to headshot someone with a pump, the inconsistency of its damage combined with the consequences of missing a shot, or even landing a bodyshot due to the rate of fire made it a skilled players weapon as an unskilled shooter or even an average one was taking a huge gamble because even for a skilled player it can be hard to headshot someone who is bouncing around.

Now the pump is an average gun, and what made it so good before was it was the clutch weapon, it was the one thing that could save you when you are down to 20 health now it cannot really do that.  IMO, if the pump is going to be nerfed the damage should remain the same double pump should just be eliminated.  Force ppl to pump/rifle, pump/tac, pump/handcannon or whatever but eliminate the double pump because even with its slower speed it is overpowered (to a degree) when At its previous damage.  I say leave the damage, the potential for 225.  Personally I'd like to keep the double pump but if Epic really wants to nerf it just eliminate double pump but keep the damage.

What are you guys' thoughts? Do you agree, disagree? I'd definitely like to hear your thoughts and solutions ",FortNiteBR

1. No SQUADS for this LTM? Really?!? To be honest that's what hurts more, most LTM are casual modes to have lot of fun and laugh a lot with friends, but EPIC is preventing us for having a great time with more 3 friends? wow...  

2. They AR's are destroying this mode.  When we talk about ONLY sniper mode, it literally means ONLY snipers (snipers and hunter rifle). Adding granades/c4 is fine, adding revolvers (V1) was not good but was acceptable, but ARs??? NO! Just NO! Just because they have a scope doesn't mean its a sniper.   
Most people who love this LTM are just like me, snipers lovers and people who want to practice with snipers, and also have a good laugh with a 1 minute very close range 'bunny sniper' fight with 10 more people; and try to land those 200m\+ sniper shots.   
Other than that, all I see are tryharders playing this mode ""just"" to have hands on the new gun, or casual and snipers lovers being pissed because of that. ""Oh, lets play the LTM to 'test' the new gun"". 

LT;DR:  It should have Squads option; AR's destroyed this mode.  


No hate, just my opinion. 

Cheers!

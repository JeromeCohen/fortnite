It's time for the ultimate dance-off. Dance Floors have spawned around the Battle Royale island. Take them over by clearing out any enemies and then dancing to raise a disco ball up from the floor. The team that earns the most points by capturing and defending the dance floors will win the match!

‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã**What's New?**

* New holiday music &amp; decorations have been added to the Dance Floors‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* The center Dance Floor has been removed‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Players will now gain health &amp; shields when dancing on a Dance Floor that their team controls‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Eliminated players now drop both materials and ammunition‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Storm shrink time lowered to 30s, to minimize scoring downtime‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Storm damage lowered to 1 for circles two and three‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
Mode Details

* Two teams of fifty.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Respawning will be turned on until the third (last) storm circle.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Five dance floors will appear on the map whenever the storm is not moving. ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Emoting on a dance floor when no enemies are present will raise a disco ball in the center of the floor, and capture it for your team.‚Äã
 ‚Äã
* The more friendly players dancing on a floor, the faster it will be captured. ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Once a floor is captured, it will begin to fill a ""dance bar"" on the HUD, until either an enemy stands on it or the current storm timer ends and the storm begins to move. The first team to fill their bar to 100% will win the match. ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* The dance floors in the later stages of the match award more points, so don't give up if your team is behind!‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* It is not possible to build on or over the dance floors, but they can be fortified by surrounding them with a fort.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

* Glider redeploy is activated in this mode, press jump while falling to use your glider.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",FortNiteBR

This is about what fortnite could have been but will never be.I will go over 3 things, community, gameplay, and effect on real life.First is the community, the community is one of the worst out there,the MAJORITY are a bunch of ten-year-olds thinking their popular because they play a popular game, which makes them think that they are gods that can't be touched,and another thing this adds along with them thinking their unpunishable gods,it makes them think that they can say any word they want,and even the one that your thinking about(This comes from personal experience).So overall look of the community,not so good. Now gameplay,most players spend more time trying to break and and cheat to get an advantage rather than actually playing the real game,and the fact that it is so stressful that it causes people to rage and BAN people from the game the might have spent money on. So,round of applause for you Ninja. So overall look of gameplay,not so good. And finally, the effect on real life,it has done nothing except for cause me to question the state of humanity every time I see a ten-year-old doing a Ninja dance and to cause people to grind on this game and not play the games that are great and cause no stress or loss of friendships,example,Destiny 2,sure it is grindy but not that grindy to the piont were you're wasting days on the same objective.And it never has caused me or anyone I know stress to the point of reporting or banning anyone.Also, the graphics, gameplay, and lore just bring it all around to the point were it is just fun to play.But back to Fortnite. So outlook on the effect on real life,not so good. Now before you cuss me out or report me,just know.This is the experience of me,14 other people,and the data collected from real people and comments. So thank you for your time and I hope you take this to mind the next time you hear fortnite is the best game.",FortNiteBR

Personally I think we have too many AR‚Äôs in the game rn. Epic should increase the rate for regular scars and vault the silenced. The item would work similar to an ammo crate.

*Processing img sp7j7u2632621...*

Total Unvault would be a Solos/Duos/Squads LTM where every, and I mean every vaulted weapon\* gets re-added into the game, in the same condition it was in when it was vaulted.\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

This mode, like other LTM's, won't be taken seriously and will most likely be looked at as a ""mess around"" LTM, where you can try out weapons from the past, mainly because of unbalanced weapons like the Jetpack being in the mode.

&amp;#x200B;

If this LTM doesn't get into the game, It would still be nice to have a ""Total Unvault"" happen in Creative, because there, we are in control of what weapons we get, and if someone uses a vaulted weapon on you in Creative, you can simply tell them not to.

&amp;#x200B;

\* The Ceiling Trap, Wall Dynamo, Infinity Gauntlet, and Jump Pads will not be unvaulted as they either have more reasonable counterparts within the normal game, or in the I.G.'s case, it simply wouldn't make sense.

\*\* The Zapotron is the only exception to this rule, as it will be modified to work with the game's design, so Power Cells will just come built into the Zapotron, like the Arrows in the Crossbow, either unlimited ammo with a cooldown after each shot, or with limited ammo, destroying the Zapotron once it runs out.

(The original post was ""vaulted"" due to mentioning a certain recently vaulted weapon.)",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Get Rid of Bullet Distance Damage Drop for Shotguns/ make sure if you hit someone it does 20 damage minimum, but decrease range for shotguns

Get Rid of the Normal Pistols

Make it to where you can get Blue Pumps and Green/Blue Tacs in Chest

Get Rid of All Grey Weapon Drops from Chest

Make The Cost to Build things 8

Make the Storm in Stage 1 Deal 1 Damage per 2 Seconds

Add Loot Crates

 \[ Listen, I know this system can be abused but Fortnite hasn't really cheesed us with our money, we buy it, and get what we want, so Here's and Idea

  \- Every Week or so A new Loot Crate Cosmetic that's exclusive for that time it is available

  \- you have to open 10 Loot Crates to Get The Exclusive Item

  \- You can NOT buy Loot Crates

  \- The Normal Items Can Go into A Collection Book and Finishing A certain Part will give a Collection Book Exclusive Reward

  \- Instead of Cramming a bunch of Different Update Items into one Loot Crate, Make Separate Ones

  \- Players can earn these Loot Crates by just playing the game and it will fill a bar and when the bar is filled you will get a loot crate

  \- Players can choose which Loot Crates they want next once new ones start coming out

 \]

Remove Tilted Towers

 \[ I don't care how but please, removing it will help the flow of the game \]

Remove Lucky Landing,Lonely, Replace Tomato with old Factory's before Meteor, remove Junk, Add a New Big Area in that Corner and Place old Prison There,Make Loot Lake Flatter and Remove Water/Don't make players slowed in water

Work on the Build Grid

 \[ like placing a ramp in the river areas and most of it goes under the map, ect.\]

Increase Mat Collection from Wood

Clean up the amount of REALLY tall mountains 

 \[ keep some obviously \]

Make Cargo Crates have a slight loot increase

Make P90 have 22 Damage, Increase Bullet Spread of P90 after shooting 25 bullets with out stopping, Increase Spread when not aiming down sights

Vault Mini gun

Bring back Shock wave Grenade, and Impulse Grenades

Bring Back Glider Redeploy 

Make Grenades Cook-able

Vault Quad Launcher

Increase the amount of ammo in Ammo Crates

 \[ 2 - 3 types every time 

 \- Always a full clip plus 40% of the Clip (Example 10 bullets is mag size, so it would drop 14

 \]

Bring Back OG cross bow

Add a Training Game mode

 \[ A tiny map where players gain 10 mats ever 10 seconds

  \- Trees,cars,and brick piles regenerate

  \- all players have a Blue AR, Blue Pump or Blue Tac, and a Blue SMG

  \- Half way through players SMGs get replaced with snipers

  \- players also spawn with 450 Mats

This season, in my opinion, brought along one of the worst features this game has ever seen(less balanced than the sharp-and-pointy-thing even), planes. They allow you to break down any occurring build battle, build battles, of course, are what makes this game fun. They let people 3rd, 4th, 5th, and etc. party you. This aspect of planes can get VERY frustrating when you're trying to go for kills, challenges, or simply have fun. I'm not saying planes should be completely vaulted, but something should definitely be done to nerf them at the very least. Perhaps you could decrease the plane's health, allow it to explode upon impact with a building, or nerf the damage to people and structures. Thank you for listening to me and my frustrations with this game, I'd like to hear your guys' opinions.

TL;DR: Please Epic, by the beginning of next season have planes be in a balanced state.

In which, the survivors train their soldiers by VR. Which is a lot safer than fighting husks in the real world. This how they can murder each other and be so happy. No one is dying. Just getting kicked out of the simulation. Environments are meant to simulation environments they could encounter. Eventually, other uses are found for the simulation. Such as producing inspirational and entertaining films that would be impossible in the real world. While the soldiers are out in real combat. The film is developed in the virtual world. To save space or some other purpose, they use the same world as the soldiers. So the environment is being developed as the soldiers come back. Then, one person‚Äôs entry into the world goes wrong. The visitor is trapped within the simulation and unable to leave. He believes he‚Äôs been betrayed, attempting to overload the system with high-memory movie props. He plans on hitting Titled Towers to overload the system. But, is likely stopped by a person on the rocket that redirects it. It breaks trough the simulation but doesn‚Äôt crash it. Sending them trough the internet never to be seen again. This allows viruses to flow in. The main one is the cube. Which builds up energy to destroy the simulation. It does this in many ways. But it‚Äôs primarily trough the Corrupted and cube monsters. Using the monsters to collect energy and processing power from the players. But mostly use the corrupted. Players who have died by it directly that it can take over. That will kill for it and collect energy for it. Such as Deadfire, who is killed by the cube‚Äôs lighting strike. Turning him into a Corrupted. It ends when the cube exposes the core of the simulation. Threatening to destroy the simulation before the players can leave and kill them. The developers take action, locking the virus away. But the breach still remains...",FortNiteBR

Sorry If I'm interrupting you on your break, I just want to discuss something that I hope you wonderful people will look into. Recently in the past few months, aggressive players are being more unavoidable and more annoying for us non- aggressive players who are looking to up our wins. Over the past few months, tactics like shotgun-smg combos have become annoying for us to deal with as we have almost no chance when they come at us out of nowhere, even in the end game. These players sadly almost seem to win all the time with their tactics. This may be unpopular to many but I think the recent shotgun buff made these players even worse and made them rain supreme even more. Because of this, I'm suggesting that you guys try to do something to decrease these player's superiority in Fortnite and make enough changes so we can win games too. This may include some unpopular changes. I hope you guys recognize the issue as well as most of the vocal community.                                                                                                 

Sincerely,

The Non-Aggressive and win focused players.



And to the rest of the community: No, we don't camp in bushes all day and neither are we always salty about being killed.

As a marketing student i was trying to understand what makes you play fortnite? What do you love about the game and if you think that during the time is starting to be boring for you or is always enjoyable.
Also you think you re still playing it cause is addicting? O maybe just for play some hours with friends?
You spent money on the game and was worth it? 
Last one but the most important, if you guys could describe (if possible with one single element) which is the better aspect you prefer of the game for example:weapons, skins, is balanced, competitive etc... 
Hope (even with my awful english, not being american) you will answer me, thanks :) ",FortNiteBR

I'm not here in the community to be salty, but if something has to be fixed, it should be.

Vehicles. We all know them. None of them came with any combat style until planes came. Everybody complained about turrets and instead of listening to the fans, Epic Games added MORE. ATKs don't have a combat style, it's the players that do when on them. Quadcrashers, same deal. Even shopping carts? Nah, you gotta shoot people yourself. So why do planes suddenly break that pattern and flow by adding what many didn't want?

So my suggestion is, like many others, to make the planes into cargo styled planes. We have all these vehicles that make you fight by yourself, but why do planes? So why not make planes simple travel mechanisms just like...yknow...EVERY OTHER VEHICLE? 

I have seen many posts like mine right now, and trust me. They're not original or great anymore, but maybe if Epic listened to their community instead of the famous streamers, then we wouldn't have this problem.",FortNiteBR

I looked at it and thought it looked pretty cool. Moved on and never thought about it. Around September and early October I see this fortnite battle royale. I recognise the name fortnite and see it free so I downloaded it. I got all my friends to get it to. It was so pure back then and amazing and I understand people will disagree but fortnite was better when it wasn't massive. I think when you have a free game available on every device everyone can get there hands on it. Which is not a good thing. Not to just blame this because it's not the only reason but it's the kids man. Not all of them but the nine year olds running around dancing screaming and wearing fortnite merch. It got out and epic started focusing less on what the game was meant to be. Save the world a zombie survival and more onto this free tag along. Then they started with all the monetization and i understand it's a free game but back in season 1 and 2 it was a better game. Now it's in the news every other day and the game is less fun. Really wish we could back and keep this from going viral.

I understand whrn a game flourishes so does every part of it. The bad and the good but it seems the bad is far out weighing the good. And now it's finally falling off epic are sinking lower into v-bucks. Throwing notifications all over the item shop. And charging 20 quid for a skin ",FortNiteBR

 I want to share with you an idea for a LTM that I've been thinking about for the past few weeks, it's just a silly idea of mine but it would be pretty cool to see it live imo! I hope you guys find it amusing too :)

*Most Wanted LTM*

 A LTM where the LEAST POPULAR ITEMS in Fortnite are the only ones available (vaulted or unvaulted weapons), it would be a Solo and Squads LTM and the wins would count as a regular game.


 It's a really simple concept but I think it would be fun since most people's choices for weapons aren't available and it would bring back some good nostalgic moments if the tactical smg for example was put back in this mode. I would love to hear your thoughts on it!

Let me start off by saying that I could care less about rare skins. I mostly just use funk ops because funk ops is dope. Okay, now to the main points:

&amp;#x200B;

 Look at the way Epic games abuses pseudo- ""exclusivity"" in their advertising, it's actually ridiculous. As an example, let's take the following post. In this one post alone: you see ""Returned"", ""exclusively"", ""limited time"", and ""Don't miss out."" They know exactly what they're doing, which is trying to mislead their consumers. Nothing about this skin is actually exclusive, nor is there any less chance of it returning now that they've posted this, but at a glance that isn't the way it *seems* (especially to young kids, the primary victims of this trap). Is this illegal? No. Is it kinda shady? Definitely. /rant

tl;dr: Epic games is at least partially responsible for the toxic ""OhGee"" culture we see today. ",FortNiteBR

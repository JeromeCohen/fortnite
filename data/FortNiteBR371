So, my epic account was compromised roughly two months ago, so I begin the process of changing my passwords. My account had been locked, with the epic support website requiring you to login to view any forums to figure out where to go from there (which I could not do). 

Next I see I have a one-hundred dollar purchase in my PayPal logs, because I left my purchasing abilities with a one touch access in game(stupid I know). Okay changed PayPal password, that's fine, but I of course had to get a refund. I've bought Save the World for myself as well as my friends, but I certainly didn't purchase whatever the most expensive bundle was. I wanted to go through epic to get the refund sorted out, because that seemed like the right way to conduct it at that time. Escalating it to PayPal directly might've been a longer process I thought. I finally track down a direct support email, as well as ""contact us"" email  form on their home site. I send six emails over the course of the last two months, each with an auto reply email saying that they are looking into my request. I've checked every email folder I have and have not once received an email back. 

Eventually I realized I wasn't getting a reply and went straight to PayPal, who then promptly got my money back to me in about three days. That's fine and dandy, I even managed to change my epic account password so that history would not repeat itself. But my account is still locked, and the only reply I've gotten is just telling me that my account is locked. I've spent nearly two hundred dollars on stuff for me and my friends, and it'd be a darn shame to lose all of that. I'm still sending emails to them, but in the nearly ten I have sent, I haven't heard back once. I even sent an email explaining the situation that had happened, and that I could confirm my identity to prove I wasn't some hacker, still without any real response. Am I doing something wrong here? 

I'm sorry the formatting is probably bad, I've only posted like twice before, but I really don't know what to do at this point. Feel free to PM me if it's easier, thanks for your time guys.",FortNiteBR

-it has limited range, which means you can always run out of range to avoid it

-it can be stopped pretty easily by building a 1x1 box around yourself

-the person shooting is standing still, probably out in the open somewhere, extremely vulnerable.

-it takes time for two missiles to get to you, giving you plenty of time to push up and build another box to defend yourself. 

-you can always split up to avoid massive damage, the blast radius here is not that large

-it travels very slow, and is very loud. It's hard to be caught off guard by a guided rocket, unless you aren't wearing headphones or using audio. 

There is no need for a cooldown or any sort of nerf to the weapon. There are many ways to combat the use of the guided missle, and even if using it requires a little bit of camping, it shouldn't be changed. Also, it's a high risk/high reward weapon, meaning it puts you at a slight disadvantage just to use it. (Standing completely still) Adding new weapons creates new strategies, and conversely, new counters to those strategies.

If you think its too overpowered, or have a hard time defending against it, give High Explosives v2 a try, and practice. There's plenty to go up against. 

EDIT: Hot Take! Fortnite doesn't foster an inherently aggressive playstyle! Camping is a valid strategy!",FortNiteBR

First shot accuracy is not a good solution for many reasons. One of these is the new meta of headglitch peek spamming. Here is an example of it:  https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/89r6zw/cool_fun_new_meta/ . 

The problem with this is that you can uncrouch and crouch while still retaining accuracy, which turns ranged fights into wars of attrition because you can practically shoot while being impossible to hit.

_____________________

Another big problem is that this promotes a passive play style and overall isn't good for the flow of the game. This rewards players who camp in 1x1s instead of players being active and moving because they can't benefit from first shot accuracy because they aren't spam crouch peeking.

The TSM players had the same issues when the exact same system was introduced into shooting test 1: https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7vso4y/tsm_shooting_model_review/ .

I think this comment sums it up pretty well on why this change is liked by players and why it is liked for the wrong reason:  
&gt; reddit loves the new shooting model because it makes rushing less viable, even tho it is already much harder to pull off than defending.

&gt;it is close combat where you can get outplayed the hardest. the high skilled mofo sitting 80m away with an ar isn't as threating as the high skilled mofo with his shotgun building walls around you.

&gt;you can easily exchange shots with a player like myth from range, but in close ranges he will play circles around you and thats what a lot of people on reddit hate.",FortNiteBR

Back when PUBG reached maximum mass, the devs only added random guns and a badly optimised map whilst the game crashed and burnt and they raked in thousands from cosmetics. I believe that Fortnite has reached its maximum mass, and whilst the devs clearly aren't coping, they still shove out the aforementioned skins and updates.

""Oh let's land at the edge of the map, farm materials while everyone one is fighting and get some really good guns"" basically for free. 

Next up the first shot accuracy. First of all why? Let's not forget about the damage drop off too, so now a noob who is hiding or sitting at the edge of the storm is gonna get his shot 100% accurate on me and possibly laser me afterwards? 

I have a feeling this game is changing from running all around the map searching for equipment and people to fight, to just staying in the back in a 1x1 place hiding until you find someone totally off guard and having good guns cause they farmed materials and got equipped with these new vending machine.

Let's not forget Fortnite are from the same creators from Paragon, you know that MOBA that had unique mechanics, was different from any other MOBAS in a number of ways and after each update it kept getting dumbed down until they completely killed it and stopped development.

Epic, what your basically doing is encouraging people to stay in the back away from ALL action and still get rewarded for doing absolutely nothing.

I love playing this game and having a good time with my friends on it. About a week ago I lost everything. It all started when I attempted to link my Xbox account to the PC account that I play on. In order for me to have all my skins and wins on one account I had to disconnect my Xbox from a previous account that is was connected to. after I got everything linked up and ready to play I noticed I had none of the skins I had before then I noticed my battle pass was gone and so on. First thing I did was try to reconnect to my old account but no luck. Then I tried looking online at the leaderboards just to check everything wasn't completely gone which it isn't all my stats are on my original account and I'm sure epic can check that I made all the skin purchases which amounted to over 200$. I submitted a ticket a while back and I've gotten no contact back from anyone. I just want to get back playing a game I really enjoy. If everyone could help me out and upvote this in hopes that someone can see this and fix this for me please do so.

Here's why.,"So just since this morning I've seen *plenty* of complaints from many different places about the new vending machine being OP. As usual I figured people were overreacting, and I want to help ease some peoples minds on why this is not the case.

(This is all from my own experience, please be reasonable with calling me an idiot, and correct me on info I may have gotten incorrect :))

* Spawns
Vending Machines have fixed spawns locations, but are not guaranteed to spawn in those set locations. In my initial experience with finding them, rates are that of chests. I may have just gotten unlucky, but I have barely found any vending machines since playing this morning.

* Costs | Weapon Rarity
Weapon costs are at 100 mat. intervals (ex. Common being 100, Uncommon being 200, etc.) What you get is *completely random* (I think). I've heard many people saying &gt; 500 wood for a Gold Scar? I could just go to Wailing Woods or Moisty and get that! OP plz fix!!!!

Yes, you could definitely easily farm up materials for said scar, but the odds that you actually get a vending machine with the deal is unlikely, not to mention you're dealing with other people, the storm, and the fact that the vending machine might not even spawn with what you want.

Also, not many people are going to want to give up materials for items, especially if you build very often (like myself).

Another thing, what makes the Vending Machine so much worse then getting lucky and finding what you want out of a chest? You're sacrificing valuable time and materials for the items the vending machine is giving. You are essentially *working* for your gear in this case. Imo this is a much more fair option as opposed to getting lucky and *hoping* you find what you want/need out of a chest.

**TL;DR The Vending Machines are balanced by random spawns, fair trade offs with materials for items, and taking time to aquire those materials, especially early game**

Sorry this post was so long! Hopefully it was easy to understand, apologies if not, I'm not the greatest with making clear and concise sentences. 
All in all I think we all need to stop overreacting over every little addition to the game, Epic is a fantastic and transparent Team, if something truly doesnt belong in the game they will tweak or remove if needed.

What it did do was break the servers for the second time in as many days.

Whilst I love getting new stuff in the game, plenty of games have imploded due to releasing too much too quickly in the past. We've got a *TON* of new stuff recently that should appease us all for weeks.

Epic has clearly been neglecting bug fixes over the last few updates. Maybe they need new/more/better debugging staff, maybe they just need time, but today when I come home and just want to play some squads with the boys, I'm met by a soul crushing ""matchmaking is temporarily disabled"".

Epic: Please spend the next week or two just focusing on bug fixes and improving your server capability. We have the heavy shotgun, guided missile, vending machine, a bunch of new skins and items, we're good to go over the Easter break and I think I speak for the majority when I say that I would rather a smooth game than one with constant updates.

It would also be nice to get some acknowledgment of this, an actual explanation of *why* it keeps happening and why it takes so long to fix..

Practice literally every mechanic in the game (building, shooting, swapping weapons etc). 

Aggression pays off.  

Land in 3 or 4 spots and familiarize yourself with them before branching out (I started with wailing woods because you get into good fights in the maze and there is plenty of loot and materials).  

Try to get a height advantage in duels. 
Take fights based on your weapons (don’t get in a close fight if you don’t have a shotgun/don’t try to outsnipe a bolt action if you have a burst ar).  

Don’t always go for wins, learning how to duel is very important if you want to win that final 2 duel.  

I’m sure there are countless other things I can’t think of right now because I’m so giddy but most importantly have fun and don’t give up.  The matchmaking in this game is really fast so if you lose a game just hop into another one and keep on keepin on.  Thanks to everyone on this subreddit and in the Fortnite community!!",FortNiteBR

The guided missile is a fantastic addition to the game and yet there are people throwing tantrums about it breaking the game and being overpowered. To combat a guided missile you can shoot it down or build to block the missile not to mention it is extremely loud and exposes it's user and leaves them vulnerable and open to be killed. What the guided missile forces you to do is adopt a different tactic to counter it.

This isn't the first time people have complained about an innovative weapon either, Initially the minigun was thought to be overpowered and game breaking until people learned how to counter it(since it is innacurate but shreds buidlings the answer is to attack from long range or rush the minigun wielder whereas building a fort is ineffective as it quickly gets destroyed.

Chances are many of the people complaining didn't play the game early on where weapons were bland and only a couple of tactics were viable in endgame.

The point i am making is the best additions to the game are the ones that forced people to addopt different strategies to use and forced their opponents to create counter strategies and i personally want to see more of these weapons and items added(impulse grenade,boogie bomb,minigun,guided missile etc)

It should go without saying this is my opinion and is not stated as a fact.

But this patch came out of the blue suddenly and Shooting Test 2 was completely forgotten.

There was no warning about this patch incoming, and many of us were waiting for Shooting Test 2 to come out and be tested.

There is no real good reason for Shooting Test 2 to be ignored if a major changing in the shooting model was going to be incoming.

Shooting Test 2 was leaked, and many players were able to test it out, and thought positively of it's demonstration.

So the fact that it wasn't tested in full, like Shooting Test 1 was, before these new shooting model changes came out was a mistake.

I think with the issues already presenting themselves, this match may need to be rolled back, and if so Shooting Test 2 should given a major shot before any further changes to the model are made.

You could have someone aiming at an enemy’s head, and miss nearly every shot due to bloom/recoil. But have someone aiming at the body and get 2 lucky headshots and down the player instantly.

Lack of support doesn't protect a fair playing environment as you might expect... it simply turns Fortnite into a $150 pay-to-win for anyone willing to drop the $150 on the adapter.  And you know what else.... Fortnite was not built (in my opinion) to be played on a controller. The sniper shootout mode is a perfect example of how the game breaks down on console; 99% of the fights are people jumping in circles hoping to land the first shot with a hunting rifle and it's just.... bad.  Why should I have to drop another $700 on a gaming PC just so I can use a fucking mouse and keyboard on a game I already own that supports mouse and keyboard.... let's put our big boy thinking caps on and realize that denying mouse support isn't protecting us from those 'evil mouse users,' it's just putting a $150 wall between fair play.",FortNiteBR

PLZ FOR The love of god just make a statement or comment. Maybe an ETA on a massive game fixing patch. No extra content, just fixing issues with the game. 


The game isn’t gonna die if you take a week off from adding magical vending machines and orbital strikes, and focus on tidying up your game and making the game on consoles playable.

Fortnite has taken the world by storm and created unforgettable experiences for literally every single person who enjoys the game. However (mainly on console) there are a few bugs which really ruin the game and make it unplayable (nearly). 

So what are these bugs? Well I’ve personally encountered the weapon switching bug a lot, the weapon switching also feels slower than previous patches (maybe it is just me). Recently I’ve also encountered the unable to edit glitch many times and this is incredibly frustrating as an avid builder. So why am I telling you this when you already know of all these bugs? Well I’ve got an idea.

Personally I love fortnite the way it is obviously the additions of new guns, traps and locations keep the game fresh but I would rather have a smooth game. So how can you guys fix this? Well I’ve given it some thought and: what if you  guys take 2 weeks off of designing new items and locations and just fix the bugs? If this isn’t a realistic option then how about hire more people in the servers/ bugs department? Not saying they aren’t doing their job. It’s just that the game is bigger than anyone ever anticipated and maybe they need a little bit of help. I know this is incredibly long and badly written (did it on my phone).  But I really do think this could help you all over at Epic.

Kind regards

     -

Vending machines were added in today's [4/04/18] update, and they do not spawn in random locations.


They are in certain spots consistently. Three spots that I currently know of are the broken down house behind Dusty Depot, the big log cabin in Lonely Lodge, and a cabin on near the lake at Loot Lake.


A vending machine will be any rarity. This means it will give you a common, uncommon, rare, epic, or legendary weapon. An item will cost [common=100] [uncommon=200] [rare=300] [epic=400] [legendary=500] material. 


There will be three different, random items to choose from! You can switch between the items by hitting the vending machine with your pickax.

It's sometimes fun to turn a fight around with one shot, but it does suck when it happens to you.

That said, given how inconsistent shotgun damage currently is, and how wonky the hitboxes are, I don't believe it's fair to have such damage multipliers in the game for shotguns right now with head shots.

I used to think it was simply that I needed to be better, I would go back and study clips of my play and wonder what the heck just happened. But until the devs can definitively fix the hitboxes and damage issue, I think the damage multiplier needs to be turned down.

It's maddening to hit someone in the head a couple of times and them still be alive, and then get one shot in the head from their shotgun. It's simply unfair.

Plus I feel the game anyway is too reliant on Close Quarters combat. Everyone wants to simply rush in and get a one shot on their opponent. And with how wonky shotgun battles are currently, it's just not good for meta.",FortNiteBR

I really like that you've nerfed hitscan and HS damage.. this is amazing ! , but the new mechanic by itself don't fit well with fortnite... the recoil take years to reset after you stopped moving.. but you can almost hold down M1 while you're shooting and have 100% accuracy.

This make the AR really awkward to use as you need to completely stand still.. making the game overall slower , and ghostpeeking (or quick peeking since the brick change (good move on that tho)).

- only viable way to counter it is by building all 4 sides + the roof which makes you sitting duck and easy target for other players.. at that moment you just pray noone else comes around cuz if you get forced to duel, that cunt with guided missile will most likely wipe both of u

- it makes pushing very expensive and shooting it down might be almost impossible if pilot knows how to maneuver

- pilot can use terrain to his advantage, sometimes shooting it down is not an option if hills/trees/buildings stand in your way, cuz of that you are forced to build up every couple of steps..

- having guided missile is even more OP in duels/squads, at this point you are not risking anything and gain so much

- encourages camping

""Crouch to have more accurate aim, or go under stuff?

There is no reason STW does not have crouch honestly. And I am not saying that I need it, never said that in this post it's just nice to have that basic function since it exists in BR :)

Also that it is early access is not an excuse right now, Battle Royale is also early access but it has these functions.

I understand there has been a lot more added since I started playing this game, including visual updates etc. But the map is still the same size, there is still the same amount of people in the game (not players on the servers, I know that’s increased dramatically). Somehow the lag is now becoming a more ever present issue on both consoles by reading this subreddit on a regular basis with little mention of PC encountering as much lag as us. (PS4 player myself).

I really enjoy this game and I know a hell of a lot of other people do too, I just hope Epic take a couple weeks off of adding new things to the game (vending machines??) to focus on bringing this game back to having the same amount of stability that they had a couple of months back. 

This is on the back of me completing the enormous 10GB update this morning and still experiencing the lag and bugs from yesterday prior to the patch. (I am aware Epic have made a post about their confusion as to why the patch was so big, however whatever was in this patch, no matter the size, didn’t seem to make an ounce of difference for players)

They could stay in the store longer when they are available, but they should not be brought back annually.

I say this because there is an important sense of exclusivity in these skins. When you see a player with the skeleton skin, you know to be scared, because they’ve been playing for a while, but, come next October, you won’t know if it’s a veteran or just some 5th grader who got his parents’ credit card because he likes skeletons.

Last night I was talking with my friends about the smoke grenade and we got so many ideas on how to use it but now they're vaulted. In late game it can simply help you a lot when rushing a tower. Just throw a smoke at the top and you're good to go, you can just rump rush or even break the whole thing. If the smoke grenades were back, you could combo them with c4, and make some kind of death area where people wouldn't know that they're about to get 'sploded. The smoke grenades were there when the playerbase wasn't so experienced, and it has grown so much skill-wise that almost every fight I get has at least a bit of excitement and it's not a simple ""build a 1x1x1, peak with shotgun and keep walking"". Having an alternative to panic building would be very appreciated. You can just build 2-3 walls to protect you while throwing a smoke and run in the opposite direction of where your enemy is, or just use a jump pad and jump out of the smoke in some epic way. Those things have a huge outplay potential and I hope they come back soon. What do you guys think about the smoke grenades? did you use them or never pick them up?",FortNiteBR

As I'm dropping bullets for him I just make random accents as we're just all teenagers, college students, and college graduates. The guy that I dropped the bullets to said he would fight me and f**k me up and I took it as a joke, since whenever I squad up with different groups of friends we just joke around, but I feel like I hurt this guys feeling / offended him and apologized to him via in game chat. Never meant for any harm and never looked at his perspective that he may be sensitive. If that is the case I believe I deserve a temporary ban as it was very rude and offensive of me to mimic random accents even though other people do the same to me.

""This one squad had one guy spamming me with guided missiles, while the other 3 members were ARing my 1x1 to death.""

Three things...

1.  How is the any different than a regular rocket launcher spamming you while 3 people are ARing your base down?

2.  What are the other 3 members of your squad doing to make this 1 on 4 scenario?

3.  If it's actually a 1 v 4, arent you usually toast anyway?

Honest answers only.  I play solos and duos exclusively so I don't know what it's like in squads.",FortNiteBR

I am not a great Fortnite player but I can still build to defend against it. For solos it is almost utterly useless in the beginning of the game since there are so many people you can get killed while using it. It only is good when there are around 20 people left and people are base camping or hiding. 

In Squads it may be a bit stronger as teammates can protect you while you are firing it but again, it still means they will be one man down in a firefight. And if you can't take the squad with one man using the guided missile and the other 3 using whatever guns, you probably were going to lose to them whether they had the missile or not. 

Basically what I am saying is that it is a good gun, and I think it is balanced for it's rarity. It is not overpowered. ",FortNiteBR

Player A shoots player B at the same time that player B shoots player A.

Player A does enough damage to knock / kill player B. 

Player B sees his pellets hit on his shotgun shot into the face of player A, but because he gets knocked / dies the shot doesn’t count at all.

Why is this a thing?

Why shouldn’t two people be able to shoot each other at the same time? Just because one goes down does not mean the other person never shot. 

This is one of the most frustrating parts about the game to me.

I used to love glider redeploy but it has turned into too big of an advantage for the attacker. You used to be able to pop 2 minis and a medkit and reload after fights, but now you have someone on top of you after every kill.  

Pumps specifically are too weak to consistently outplay people. Without the ability to one pump someone, you have to hit twice as many shots against a 160hp+ enemy as they do to you if you're 160hp-. Even if I hit a perfect pump headshot, attackers still have health while all they have to do is hit a bodyshot against me and I'm dead if they divebomb me before I can heal. You have to play the fight almost perfectly while they can just barrel stuff you one time. I understand that higher hp players should have an advantage, but being able to dive bomb anyone directly after a fight before they can heal takes away from the skilled player winning and gives shielded players way too big of an advantage for nothing. Shields are too scarce to give such a big advantage.

The ability to one pump someone meant you always had a chance and worse players didnt win strictly because they had more shields and could kill you with one headshot while you couldnt kill them with one. Dive bombing has increased this issue tenfold. Shotguns haven't kept up with the 3rd party dive bomb meta and whoever has more shields between equally skilled players win a lot more than whoever played the fight better. A 163hp player can survive a perfect pump headshot while a 162hp player will die too one. 1hp difference results in taking twice as many shots to kill and the meta is to dive bomb people with a 100+hp advantage. Shotguns need to be adjusted. One pumps used to give the higher skilled players more of a chance and dive bombing gives people too much of an advantage for nothing. One pumps would be a huge step in the right direction in fixing shield scarcity. Instead of increasing shield spawns which would STILL be RNG, one pumps would make them less of an absolute necessity while still giving them a slight advantage",FortniteCompetitive

\- The game would have a timer with a safezone that closes after a while to force teams to engage each other

\- There would be many maps. They should each benefit some kind of gameplay, but follow a pattern of open space at the middle for buildfights and high towers at the edges for sniper fights (maybe the whole map being editable, idk)

\- Maybe get a way to include STW classes into the game (or maybe i'll just play overwatch already)

This mode heavily favours the aggressive player and there is hardly any dull moments such as farming or spending minutes looking for the best loot.

Glider redeployed is arguably the biggest single redefining game change epic has made. It has its ""pro"" and cons but before we talk about that we need to figure out what led us to this.

&amp;#x200B;

Mobility: mobility has been single handedly the main issue that epic has had to deal with since season 1. Just like every other br game, mid game can get boring while the map closes so they need some mobility options to move around the map. However, this needs to be balanced. Since season 1 we have seen the introduction of things like launch pads and the reworked bouncer now even quads. All which offered alternative mobility options but weren't inherently unbalanced. Even impulse grenades were ok, and took a degree of skill to kill someone with. The reworked Bouncers really were the best option and vaulting them was one of Epics biggest, most confusing mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's take about the ""pro"" and the cons of glider redeploy. Epic apparently didn't realize from playing the soaring solo's LTM that glider redeploy has flaws.

&amp;#x200B;

""Pros""

Mobility

Cons

1.)Building does not reward or even require skill anymore- high ground , lazy builds

2.)Third partying is more common then a grey burst from a chest.

3.)Running away from fights- worse then turtling

&amp;#x200B;

The pro and the cons:

Like I mentioned earlier, the underlying cause for glider redeploy is a need for increased mobility. But considering there are other more viable options for mobility why throw out a giant chunk of the skill gap to get there?

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Building- over the seasons as a whole, we have watched as players have improved in skill and building. I remember back in season 2-3 when people were finally starting to build more, half the playerbase would just ramp at you without walls. I was always shocked how many people you would shoot out as they just ramped at you! Then over time we saw people learning the importance of reinforcing your builds and how to safely build. Before glider redeploy if you over built , you were punished and learned from it. If you pushed someone ramp wall instead of learning to use floor as well you were punished. Even the ability to learn to build down from height, which shockingly half the community never learned, was eliminated. Now you just see people lazily building into the sky with no concern over getting shot down or how they will get down.

2.) third partying- not sure this even needs an explanation but you shouldn't be able to rotate 200-500+ meters every single time you want to. Before you were required to have found a launchpad or rift, which although is RNG is still fair. Now there is more then a 50% chance if you are fighting someone you get third partied, just cause they heard the shots in the far distance.

3.) running away vs turtling - personally this is one of the more annoying aspects of glider redeploy. If someone was turtling, you either knew how to kill them or you spammed away their mats. Although this is annoying, it is fair as if someone properly loots mats, they are rewarded with the ability to stay alive and possibly retake the advantage. Now people run away the instant they are at a disadvantage. I am sick of playing hide and seek in fortnite, if anything just make that an LTM...

&amp;#x200B;

The SOLUTION Unvault the Bouncer and return to the Core Gameplay that gave you success : summing up everything, glider redeploy is a bad solution to a problem epic recreated when they vaulted the bouncer. The most viable option is to reintroduce the bouncer into the game. Not only does it allow for increased mobility when used alone or with a launch pad, it also offers a safe way to get down from high structures. This way people still can be shot down, but are able to survive if they know how to and properly use their resources. It is a shame that we've gotten to this point, as the relationship between epic and the community in the past has been very constructive and positive. Now it just seems like they took notes from Daybreak Games...

I am not mechanically the best so I'm sure a few of you guys will be able to get it with practice. 

  
I wanted to open this mechanism up for discussion with controller players.

Here are some of my findings.

1. Practice jumping on a floor as seen in [Speedy's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I72SzFcKy_4) 
2. Jumping too early doesn't get you high enough.
3. Jumping too late your left shoulder will hit the pyramid again leading to an unsuccessful jump.
4. Both sides are possible. Funny enough I hit the jump on the left side quicker than the right.

I think that the kills in the competitive scene right now are mostly catching people rotating during those final circles and are not interesting enough. 

  
playing Blitz right now, with the 50% materiel increase I actually just land in a house and break some furniture and I'm literally good to fight , I think materiel cap should change and I have a few ideas that I think should be tried, and I will explain how it will help the game.  


the first suggestion is capping each material to 750, resulting in a maximum of 2250 mats, but increase mat harvested by 50%, that way we will see some very interesting build fights even before the first zone even started and player wont have to delay so much on harvesting, this get me to increasing the kill reward, reward more for killing, then players will be more comfortably aggressive, not to mention the new glider redeploy, people wont be scared to fight anymore and it will be rewarded properly, I think another great idea to test would be awarding kills for placement as well, for example if you killed 5 players and got 1st place, you will earn extra points for each kill you while winning.   
I think the general idea is pretty clear and the details in it can be changed in many ways.  
another idea could be even a 500 per materiel cap.   
I think this change would make fortnite more fun, and even though its a competitive scene focus change it will be a fun change for the casual players, not having to waste so much time on harvesting, and in top of that you don't need a lot of materiel in pubs.   
I think that the building mechanic is what made fortnite such a unique game in the first place, and seeing the pro players only using building to turtle and take high ground is not satisfying enough in my opinion and in many others.  
any ways I have so much more ideas related to this general idea, but I don't want to make this post too long, I would like to hear your opinion and other suggestion and maybe people will start realize that this change is what fortnite need.

30 players lobby. Game starts right after 3rd circle. Each player is randomly spawned in a 1x1 box with Full health/shield, 2000 materials, Blue AR, Blue pump or Tactical, Sniper, 5 bandages and 3 mini shields.

Yeah numbers could be different but consider these:

* A game like that will last around 10 minutes only. That means you can play around 5-6 games per hours. With scrims right now you can play only 2 per hour.
* Everyone has loot, materials and position to start with.
* You have much more people alive for 4th circle than in a typical public match.
* The game is focused on late game fights and rotations.
* In the short time you play you get experience in fighting and rotations, not looting early game.

Build to high and not pay attention to the bloke shooting you down - jump-n-glide 

Not pay attention to other player or storm - jump-n-glide 

The idea of adding more mobility into the game I'm all for, however, simply being able to disengage without planning to beforehand can be left unpunished. Re-deploy should have limited movement compared to jumping from the bus or a launchpad so the player who out built or whatever it may be can have some punish.

TL;DR: Risk/reward for disengaging or rotating with re-deploy has to be adjusted so gliding isn't always the go-to and requires thought beforehand.",FortniteCompetitive

I'm not really talking about getting above/below someone with a pyramid and putting a placing a trap from complete safety, even though I think it's pretty unfair but it's easy enough to counter someone trying to do that. 

I'm more referring to finally breaking into someone's turtle and they don't even attempt to shoot or build their way out, instead they just desperately try to spam traps and once one gets placed there's literally nothing you can do to avoid it because they go off pretty much instantly and that's at least 3/4 of my health gone in an instant and with very little skill on the opponents end. Then instead of being able to push and finish the guy I'm forced to break out giving him the chance to either finish me or build out. I've been losing so many fights that I otherwise would have won recently to this skill-less tactic.

I believe that there should be a counter for everything, and at the moment the only way to avoid a trap is to pray that you're lucky enough to be on the far side of the box when he puts it down. I know some of you are probably going to say ""replace his wall with yours and edit it"". Yeah, easier said than done when I have to switch from my weapon to build while he can just keep his finger on the wall/roof button whilst turbo-building at 20 clicks per second. Then when I finally replace his wall he'll just shoot it out and replace it as soon as I take out my gun. 

&amp;#x200B;

Seems stupid right now.,"Is there even a point in build fighting in pubs any more? I just want to hear your take because I've had some truly frustrating games in the past couple of weeks.

I mean right now, it seems like getting the high ground is pointless in buildfights. The enemy will just glide away and you will restart the fight, until one of you is either dead or low mats. I tried for some games this strategy:

* Shoot
* Fight for high ground but no more than 4 stories high
* If I get it, AR spam
* If I don't get it, go down and break the structure to make them come down and shoot me.

Why should I even bother to build battle? Anyone else feels that way? At least in pubs?  


(AGAIN, I'm talking for pubs or pub competitive, like fnpl. Not pro games.)

&amp;#x200B;

I just had a game with 13 kills and let me describe you each one.

* Tilted land 8 kills
* AR kill in leaky lake (9 total)
* A kid shoots me from pleasant rifts. I start going towards him. He spammed AR while I was climbing the mountain. When I reached the top (having spent at least 200 mats to counter his AR spam), I got 1 pump shot in (like 100ish damage) and he glides away. I shot with the AR for 30 or maybe 60 damage but I don't kill him. I chase him near lazy links but he uses rift to go. I get in his rift and follow him. He is on the mountain near Tomato. He spammed AR while I was gliding and when I reached the mountain he run away. Finally I caught him inside tomato. 20 second fight dragged to 2 minutes. (10th kill).
* Shortly after that I hear someone gliding. We start build fighting. I take the high ground fairly quickly. He glides away. I chase and we do EXACTLY THE SAME. I take the high ground (I even took a couple of shots in) and he glides away. We do it for the THIRD FREAKIN TIME. AGAIN HE GLIDES AWAY. This time I got lucky bloom with AR and got 2 headshots while he was gliding. That kid honestly had not chance. I wasted around 1000 mats and got around 150 back. (11th kill)
* Back to farming because ... Fortnite.
* Two more kills end game.

Right now, public mid game SUCK BALLS. I constantly feel that I either have to farm or chase people. I understand why people like the glider but what I just described sounds like quality gameplay to you?

Honestly, I have equal amount of practice &amp; fun if I land in a hot drop, get kills and action, farm up to 500 mats and then stay afk till late game.

And yeah I know the answers already.

* Lol kid. Hit your shots end the fight faster: YEAH no shit sherlocks. That can't always be the case. Even top level players cannot do that every time. Even in pubs.
* Spam AR while they are gliding: Yeah I did that. Read again.

Gliders are destroying this game. They need a nerf ASAP. Or at least make farming materials easier. It's stupid to waste 80% of playing time on either farming or chasing people who fly around with gliders.",FortniteCompetitive

It’s actually insane. There is 0 room for any mistake. I just died because my biggest mistake is that I accidentally held down w and fell through my ramp. Stuff happens so fast, but takes so long in between each game.

Anyone remember when Tfue said that building is probably the most important skill to learn? I’d strongly disagree. A casual player could easily kill someone who could outbuild anyone, as long as their positioning, a little bit of accuracy, and their weapon is good. I have 195-200 ish wins (probably could be something like 225 if I didn’t play pg so much) and a 1.3 kd. Yet nearly anyone I meet says I’m way better than that.

Crossposting here because I really would like some feedback.,"First of all I know that the majority of players are mad about “no fall damage lol” and I get that and I agree that it’s made battles a bit different. Though I think there is a way to keep the convenience of redeploy and fluidity of traversing the map and also keep the risk factor of fall damage in the game at the same time. 

1: make gliders get worn out. 

-if you are using a glider right off the bus or off a jump pad you’re glider won’t get worn out.

-if you use it Any other time your gliders “health” will be reduced. 

-the only way to get your glider to max again would be to repair it with metal. 

This would make you have to use the glider as a resource and would force people to be more tactful in how they use their glider. 

If you third party somebody from a mountain your glider could be too worn out to escape if you lose a build fight. This would tone down the third parties and allow for some tactful gameplay as you Gauge how much glider the opponent has available in fights.

2: allow people to get shot off of their gliders.

-if you take a certain amount of damage while gliding you should lose your “grip” and fall. 

This should also completely bust your glider forcing you to have to do a full repair of for some reason you survive the fall..(perhaps using a jumpad would give you temporary boost of glider health, making the jump pads more valuable and less redundant with redeploy) 


I would love Epic to test something like this with redeploy because I think it certainly makes traversing the map a lot easier and fluid but I think their needs to be a little more risk involved as well. 


Please leave the memes behind. I really just want to use this post to explore other ways to balance redeploy. Change can be very good for a game and I think having redeploy can be a great addition to the game if done correctly.

* Remove pull out delay: it feels really clunky to pull out a gun and can only shoot a bit later. Shotgun play rewards skill and it makes build + shoot a distinct style of Fortnite. It separates the god player from good player from how fast they can build and shoot given a smallest time possible. While the delay is in the game, it limits those players from such play. You want to reward people for being better than others.

* Remove gun swapping delay: same thing, it makes the game feels really clunky especially with the circle appears every time you shoot a shotgun and swap. The swap delay should only apply for swapping to the same shotgun, so you can't double pump but pump tac is possible. It promotes variety in gun play. Currently we only have: shotgun -&gt; Spray. With this change we can have 1 more style that we had in season 4: shotgun -&gt; shotgun.

 **-****&gt;** Enable good players to have another mean to kill player when they don't want to spray and pray with bloom is in the game. (I'm looking at you Daequan)

* Remove swap circle when you only use one shotgun.



**2. Glider :**

Remove glider completely from the game. The cons heavily outweigh the pros.

- Do you remember when people take pride in learning how to do triple layers roam,wall,floor push? It was really hard to do but people spent time on learning it? Because it's good and it protects you from getting shot down. It doesn't matter anymore, there is no fall damage. You can fly now if you get shot down. No need to learn it anymore, just single roam build. **Skill gap lowered.**

- Do you remember it takes skill to get off the build fight? Either by fast editing everything to go down, or jump down side way and build 2 wall + roam down. Do you remember how much time people spent in playground to practice those things? No matter, you can glide down now. **Skill gap lowered.**

- Did you ever think in your head ""ez kill"" when you were getting into a fight against a guy who barely know how to build or at least he knows how to build to some extent but you are much better than him anyway? He has no escape, when you get on top of him that's a wrap. No matter. He can glides and runs away now.

 -&gt; Inb4 the comment: ""but you can shoot him off if he glides away"". Ok, yeah? Let's compare the chance I can kill him if he doesn't have that mean of an escape and when he has it? It's almost 100% I can kill the guy who is worse than me unless he pulls off a crazy pump headshot. Now if he glides away, what's the chance I can shoot him dead off the sky? Incredibly much harder. Even if you have a godly aim you can never have a ""real good chance"" of killing the guy. Now if the guy is stuck under your build, that's a confirmed kill. 

 -&gt; From something that takes skill to escape from a fight. Now every bots can do it. Just press space bar. **Skill gap lowered**

- Do you remember how quick you can kill a guy if you out-skill him in the previous seasons? Now because of turbo building (discuss later) and glider. If the guy thinks he's losing the fight he can just glide away. The typical fight currently lasts longer and drag on more than before the glider changes

- Do you remember how many 3rd potential at mid game we discussed earlier in the season? Yeah, it's now 10x that. With the glider in the game, everyone will fly at you, combining with the more dragged on fight. You will get chain 3rd party till forever. Every games I play now, once there's a shooting sound. There are always 5-6 people appear in less than 10 seconds. So it's either you find no one, or you get caught between the bullet rain from everywhere unless you kill the guy in a few seconds and that only happens if the guy is a complete 5 years old bot which is extremely rare.

- Do you remember it takes skill to build and remember the foundation of your build at the same time? Or knowing when to rotate, knowing the position you are in is good or bad. Should I take a fight up the mountain or below? If I camp on top of a high 1x1 I would risk getting shot down and die by a rocket. No matter. You have a get out of jail free card now. Just build on top of the mountain without risk of anything cause you can glide now. 

 -&gt; I have the friend who is a bot at the game. If he gets into a build fight, he'd die in 5s. After the glider introduced? He lives much longer, the fight drags on every time he gets out-built, just glide down and there are a bunch of 3rd party that help him out.


Some people say having glider make the game less RNG. To some extent. Remember in the past, the guy who has a lot of launch pads always have a lot of kills? And others that don't? It's a show off who is good and who is not. The guy who is good will kill people to obtain launch pad. Do you know how many bad players can't play the launch pad? They either don't know they have it or their head process to slow to either think about using it while getting shot at? The better player then is rewarded an ability to go from place to place. Now? everyone has it? If it makes the game less RNG then just let it stay in competitive only. We casual don't want it.

**Is there no solution for this?**

Let it in the game only and only if balloon stays. You can only redeploy glider if you using it off of a balloon and you can't dive while using it. You want mobility of a glider? You have to sacrifice a slot for balloon and it's slow so you can't use it to dive people and it can only be used for rotation only.

**3. Explosive**

Pretty much everyone agreed explosive takes little to no skill to use and it's really powerful after the buff to the area of effect.

- The damage should be decreased the farther you are away from the point of explosion.

# Competitive

**1. Kill incentives:**

Currently there is little to no kill incentives because if you fight the team at your caliber, you're gonna lose all of your mats and hp without getting anything significance back. You can just 3rd people running from the storm late game and get much easier kills. That's the reason why Epic thought it would be a good idea to have penetration to explosive which is ""naive"". 

It's hard to have a real incentives for early to mid game kills in a BR game. But we can try to minimize the punishment of fighting.

- You get an temporary healing buff for a kill (works like slurp juice) for 10 seconds

- The guy who died will drop (on the floor, not to the guy who got the kill, to prevent 3rd kill reward) additional mats on top of what he had. For example: 200 woods, 100 bricks, 50 metals.

- Have 10 drops across 2nd and 3rd circle where you can only obtain explosives, grappler, rift-to-go, port-a-fort/fortress and all of them are marked on the map.

 -&gt; You have to risk fighting early to get items that let you have a better chance at placing late game. We know how powerful explosive and highground is late game with rift-to-go. It will be less RNG who get them by looting.

**2. Turbo building :**

The reason it's really hard to kill people, especially at high level is because of turbo building. The fight will drag on and on and you waste every mats you've been farming.

- Let the person who initiates the pick axing wall have 0.2s priority to replace that piece of building. Meaning, after the wall/floor broke, the owner of that piece will have 0.2s (red wall) until he can place at that specific spot again. 

 -&gt; The good player who is fast can use it well but the person who is not good enough won't take much use of it because they are slow.

- Let there be a 1s cooldown of replacing a piece of building after 10 consecutive replacement in a short period of time. Meaning: when you are getting sprayed at and keep replacing the wall. 

 -&gt; Preventing boxing. You need move out of the box if you get sprayed at nonstop else you can't place anything at that specific spot for a second.

**3. Late game heal off**

Watching heal off to win isn't satisfying. 

- Let the storm constantly moves without fully closing in

AND

- Let the storm slowly closing in top down until the height of 1 or 2 walls height from the ground

 -&gt; Players can no longer sit at once place and heal to win with the storm constantly moves. The fight will also not drag on because of the storm closing in at the top. People will have to fight eventually because the final safe zone is only about 2 stories high.

Right now it can be a bit annoying where you headshot people with a shotgun that would've just done the same amount of damage as a full body shot. Like getting 80 damage headshots with shotguns when you'd basically be more rewarded for aiming for the body at that point.


Raising the damage moodier for headshots would mean each shell would do more damage for headshots, but could keep it so that pumps still only do a max of 160/170 and so on for all other shotguns.

100,Mysterious1712,1541453287,9uhsv4,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9uhsv4/suggestion_to_incentivize_kills_and_counter/,1,Suggestion to incentivize kills and counter Shield RNG,"Idea:
 Besides your health and shield bar you also have a third (reserve) bar (maxed at 100 as well), which fills up by 20 for every kill you get. The amount you have in the reserve bar does nothing as long as it's only in the reserve, but you can convert it into the shield bar whenever you want by pressing the key/button you selected for that action. It also causes a unique sound so your opponent is aware that you just filled your shield up, but he doesn't know by how much of course.

Example: You have 5 kills, so your reserve is at 100. Then you get hit for 90 shield and in response to that you press the button and convert the shield from your reserve, so you're at 100 shield again and your reserve is at 10.

Positive about this:
- You don't have to fight multiple opponents in the beginning without getting any shield at all
- Players have to decide: Do I land safe and get a ton of loot (including shields) or do I play more aggressive to get that extra shield in my reserve that I can instantly use whenever I want and thus am possibly at an advantage for late game fights?
- imo pretty exciting for competitive, for example you get hit for 170, manage to get around a corner, instantly fill up your shield
and jump around the corner again to catch your opponent off guard (basically like kinetic armor in black ops 3 for those who played it).
- opens new tactical plays considering when to use it, example: Your reserve is max at 100 and you need 50 shield. Do you now use a big shield to still have 100 in your reserve for an intense fight, but also don't get anything out of the following kills as you're already at 100 or do you use 50 out of your reserve to maximize the benefit of each kill, but have to take the 5 additional seconds in a fight to use your big shield if needed, instead of an instant fill up.

I hope everyone understands what I mean and let me know if there is something broken about this I didn't notice.
Also for those who hate the idea, what would you think about shield vending machines with a 100% spawn rate, but with way more expensive prices for the shields compared to normale vending machines.

Typically less skilled players will run and land on you non-stop before having time to heal from other fights.There's also plenty of movement in the game with shadow cubes, port a rifts, grapplers, icers, ATKs, and Quadcrashers.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
That being said, I do like redeploy in competitive because it helps with the RNG of circles and most pros won't just land on your head and risk their tournament game on it. The problem is the game can't be balanced solely around competitive. But I do think there's some good compromises here.  
  
&amp;nbsp;
  
1. Limited amount of Redeploys, maybe 1-3 per match. Try to lessen the running and landing on in pubs while also still heaving the advantage of alleviating circle RNG in competitive.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
2. Redeploy only works outside safe zone. This would result in more running and people landing on you, but again still keeps the benefit of redeploy for rotations.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
3. Redeploy is removed, but it does work off of balloons. This means you can gain the advantage of more redeploys while using balloons, but you have to give up a slot for it. Balloons are also a bit riskier to redeploy from since you float up slowly.  
  
&amp;nbsp;  
  
4. Reward redeploys for kills. You start a match with 1 redeploy, but you can gain additional redeploys for every 2 kills you get. Those numbers could be tinkered with, but it rewards aggression and still gives 1 redeploy to help with the first circle RNG.

Im sure everyone can agree the heavy is the most balanced shotgun, and represents the ideal power shotguns should have. But for some reason, the heavy shotty is the only non-explosive that doesn’t spawn as floor loot.

Adding the heavy to the floor loot pool would reduce the RNG of getting a heavy (of course, it will still be there, but not as bad), while adding more of these balanced shottys into everyones inventory.

I also want to bring up that Cyber Monday and Black Friday are coming soon so those with ""insufficient"" gear can stack up this time around.

#Hardware
So far I've came to a conclusion that a 144hz monitor is needed for competitive Fortnite gameplay, for me at least. The difference from 60 to 144 is tremendous, upon switching to a monitor of such caliber I was able to perform a lot better in reaction-based games like shooters and osu!. The thing is, there was someone in my Twitch chat (nvi8) who mentioned that 240hz was the absolute bomb for Fortnite. Is it really worth the purchase? Streaming and YouTube have helped me accumulate enough to upgrade most of my PC components. Is it worth considering the 240hz?

#Graphics Card / CPU
How much FPS do you need? My PC is not bad by any means, it's a R5 1600, RX 580 8GB (single fan) combo. I get 144fps often, but frequently it will dip below 90 and go to 50 in Tilted. 144 barely even exists when I'm streaming. In the final circles of a scrim game, I'm lucky for 60. What's an ideal graphics card that would be able to keep an ideal FPS in Fortnite? Now I just dumped a bunch of stupid details, but I'm curious as to how to stream and have good fps, some people told me to ball out on the graphics card, and others told me to spend some on my CPU and Graphics Card

#Peripherals
Mouse: Corsair Harpoon


Keyboard: Cmstorm Quickfire 


Headset: Logitech G230

First, my mouse is not the best. The grip took me a year to adapt to and it's pretty small. I've been playing with it for a good 2 years now, and I feel my aim is pretty good! The issue is that using the mouse buttons with that grip is hard. I'm trying to transition into a mouse + keyboard builder, because ZXCV is a huge burden for my thumb. Would it be wise to switch to a Logitech Mouse? Many pros I've seen have Logitech Mouses and vouch for it's sexiness and sensor.

Also, my headset. Apparently my friend (poytox) switched from the G230 to HyperX Cloud II and claimed he could hear everything in Trump. As a G230, I find myself very confused is Trump. This is strange, should I also invest in a headset?

Whether epic thought it was a “good game” or not. It was fun to play and gave good players the advantages the practice to gain. Epic is losing this all by trying to find it. Just go back. Take all this shit out, let us double shotty if we want (smgs still better) and make it easier to get shields and mats. Then you will see people fighting and not have 50 ppl In late circles.

Here's why:

1. Eliminations in Fortnite almost always result in lost health, which is a problem because the time to heal in this game is quite high and with mobility also being in season 6 there's not much time to heal before a 3rd party shows up to the fight.
2. It doesn't JUST reward aggressive play; it also incentivizes players to finish fights rather than disengage.  A good defensive player will be rewarded for fighting aggressive players rather than disengaging and running away.
3. Early game eliminations become the quickest way to gain full shield now.
4. It reduces the RNG in the game.
5. Competitively, it rewards players that pick fights and allows aggressively players to have big moments.  It also reduces the time spent healing in the game, making it more entertaining to watch.

Of course, this is just my perspective.  There could be scenarios I'm not thinking about, but I personally think that restoring full shield is a good way to promote aggressive play and at least somewhat prevent turtling.",FortniteCompetitive

Sure, there are mushrooms, but even finding those aren’t all that common aside from inside the Divot.

With how many items are being added, it feels like the loot pool of utility items is almost overflowing and making it too difficult to find shield, which by the way is a pretty game changing item. The ability to have literally twice as much HP as your opponent is a big deal and shouldn’t be left to only RNG.

The problem, in my opinion, is just how many items we have right now that spawn instead of shields. There balloons, port a forts, port a fortresses, grenades, clingers, stinks, grapplers, shockwaves, etc.

Some of these items should be vaulted firstly, specifically the port-a-fortress and balloons imo. Aside from that, either the general spawn rate of shield items just need to be increased. Either that, or some kind of sure fire way to be able to farm shield needs to be added, such as adding a vending machine to every major POI (Pleasant, Retail, Tilted, Greasy, Salty) that would always only have minis and big pots for wood.

What do you guys think? Is there a different way you’d think would be better for farming shield or is it fine as is? Let me know",FortniteCompetitive

I have nobody to play Fortnite with. This post by any means isn't a plea for you guys to add me. It's a plea to Epic to stop changing the game every week. Because I can't imagine how many other people who are experiencing what I am right now. I love Fortnite, and I've tried to justify the mechanic to my friends but it doesn't do anything.

So I thought I'd do a post on it. I'm using the latest verion of iCUE. 

[https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/icue](https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/icue)

All the steps are for hold to edit specifically, but the steps are exactly the same for hold to crouch, you just set it up using a different key.

**Step One:**

*Processing img eole3zyz8fw11...*

Step 2:

[Go to \\""Link Profile to program\\"" to enable this profile to run only while Fortnite is open, as your bound hold to edit key changes the functionality of the key to make it difficult to use for normal typing. This unfortunately means that typing in game will be a bit funky as well depending on what key you choose. ](https://i.redd.it/srh1r5bi9fw11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 3:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Locate your Fortnite exe so that iCUE knows when to load the profile. ](https://i.redd.it/mw3rzybn9fw11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 4:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Select your new Fortnite Profile, then select your keyboard in the list of Corsair devices. At the bottom left there is a tab labeled \\""actions.\\"" It will be expanded so that it looks like the above screen shot minus my already set up actions. Click the \\""+\\"" symbol to create a new action. Name it \\""Hold to Edit.\\"" On the bottom panel, check the boxes \\""delays\\"" and \\""keyboard events,\\"" then click the  button with the red circle in it, it is called \\""Record Macro.\\"" Quickly press the key you use for editing. I use \\""V.\\"" Then press the button again to end recording the keys.](https://i.redd.it/u0463u7t9fw11.png)

**Step 5:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Create a second action exactly the same as Step 4. I named mine \\""Hold 2 Edit\\"" so that I know it's the second part of the keyboard trigger. You MUST have 2 identical actions for this to work.](https://i.redd.it/ik9n9s81bfw11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 6:** 

&amp;#x200B;

[Go back to your original \\""Hold to Edit\\"" action. Select the ADVANCED SETTINGS tab. Copy the above settings, on the drop down menu named \\""second action\\"" click and select the \\""Hold 2 Edit\\"" action. This causes the keyboard to register a single press and hold of your chosen key to be a complete input. When you let go of the key, it then causes the keyboard to register the lifting off as a complete press of your chosen edit key. ](https://i.redd.it/axli2nthbfw11.png)

**Step 7:**

[Once the actions are set up, you then select the original action \\""Hold to Edit\\"" on the left, then click the key you want to use on the image of the keyboard above. This then assigns that set of actions to the chosen key. ](https://i.redd.it/lr0i9vq2cfw11.png)

Now you've got ""Hold to Edit"" functionality. You can repeat the above steps with the ""crtl"" key to enable hold to crouch as well. The second action is a must otherwise the keyboard will just keep inputting ""V"" as if you were holding it down. ",FortniteCompetitive
155,ConvertibleFN,1541384278,9u9l4k,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9u9l4k/how_to_rotate_better_more_mindfully/,1,How to Rotate Better / More Mindfully,"Hello, We're gonna talk about that good **V A L U E**

So, with rotations there are essentially two types of rotates.

**Free Rotations**

**Costly Rotations**

&amp;#x200B;

**Free Rotations** are rotations that don't require ""a ton"" of payment.

""a ton"" can be personal preference. Value of ""a ton"" depends on personal / team greed. 

Currency being one of the following:

* Health
* Shields
* Materials
* Ammo

Some may argue that **time** is also a currency, however, to keep things simple here, we're going to leave that for another day.

The most common example of a free rotation is when you get zone.

&amp;#x200B;

The second type of rotations are **Costly Rotations**. 

These rotates are rotations where you just have to spend a bunch of materials, ammo, shields, health.

The most common example of a costly rotation, is when you have to get to next moving zone, and you're the furthest team from that moving zone.

&amp;#x200B;

So now that we know that there are two types of rotations that we will be going over. What can we do with this knowledge?

Well we can start planning on getting as much free value as possible. **You don't need a free rotation to get free value.**

* Free value can be moving through natural cover such as buildings so you save  20-50 wood. 
* Free value can be using an enemy launchpad or a enemy rift.
* Free value can be using an enemy ramp to abuse redeploy.

All of these things, reduce the cost, of your **Costly Rotation**

Therefore, you're being much more effective with your economy.

Being effective with your economy can help you survive, but it can also help you kill enemies.

&amp;#x200B;

If you happen to have a free rotation, and everyone else needs to move and spend their materials. It's quite chaotic, 30\~ people moving.

Since you have a nice and easy rotation, you can interrupt these things and force fights between people. You can interrupt via some of the ways below:

* Stink Grenades
* Explosives
* Spamming

They have to move to zone, they're not going to have time to heal, or fire back at you. If they decide to fire back at you, they're either going to lose momentum relative to storm, or have someone else that they're not accounting for focus them. I'm sure everyone knows how it feels to be pinched by two different teams in late game.

&amp;#x200B;

Causing commotion in an environment in which you don't have to participate is very beneficial. It lets everyone else do damage to each other, and the more damage that they do to each other the higher chance you have at winning a heal-off / the game.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you to Kaos1shot#1905 for giving me the idea to make this guide.

Even after the buff, the white to blue burst is a terrible weapon to bring to mid-end game. It lacks the power to shoot down structures, and isn't accurate enough for mid-range fights compared to the sniper class weapons and the scoped ARs. As someone who doesn't carry SMGs and relies on the AR as a follow up, I would happily drop a golden FAMAS for a white AR. 

With the Heavy AR coming up, I feel like it's time to rotate the burst out of the weapon roster. It drops way too often, particularly from chests, and feels like it has a much higher drop rate than the normal AR. The gun simply failed as an ""alternative"" to the AR.

181,asdaasasdsasdfas,1541362844,9u6pxu,24,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9u6pxu/rank_mode_system/,1,Rank Mode System,"In reply to what the rank system should be when I recommended for [rank mode instead of customs](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9u2a2o/ranked_mode_custom_lobbies/) 

Here is how the rank system will work, The spreadsheet on the bottom of this post is much easier to understand.

1) people play placement matches to get their starting rank: 

Option A: 10 Placement Games (no stop): Basically 10 games of no skill match making like how it's a regular pub game now and scoring TBA 

Option B: 10 Placement Games (with stops): &lt;CS:GO&gt; First 2 games its a regular game and the next 2 games is based off results of the previous 2 games. Scoring TBA 

Option C: 10 Placement games (starting rank determined) &lt;LoL&gt; Bascially starts at """"silver"""" ranking but points are easier to earn because its placement games and there will be multipliers if you are much better than rank

2) Ranked Games 
			
""Rank Games: &lt;1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes&gt;

3 Games with the same 100 people with 5 minute intermissions inbetween games and your standings at the end of the three games depends if you increase/stay/lower in rank. This way people will be able to adapt to their opponents and dropping locations and be able to have more than 1 try for their ranks. 3 games is a lot of games and time so if people don't have time, they could hop on to casual games which Epic wants. Leaving inbetween the 3 games or afking in the games will result into a punishment of losing ranking points and a competitive cooldown.""			
3) Climbing the Ranks

""Similar to League of Legends ranking system, we would have rankings and divisions in the rankings. However, because the games are 2 to 3 times as long as a regular league of legends game, I thought it would be best to lower the amount of divisions from 5 to 3 so we would have Silver 1 (Best), Silver 2, and Silver 3 (Worst). Master and Challenjour will have no point cap for which Challenjour will consist of the top 200 players

How to Climb:
1) Each rank game consists of the leaderboard shown above and after all 3 games, your scoreboard will make you place in leaderboard ranking of the 100 players in your lobby.
2) It takes 150 or 200 points (undecided for balancing factor currently) to be eligible for a """"Division Promotion Game"""" where you need to play one more rank game and place top 20 or 10 (also undecided for balancing factor currently) in the leaderboard to count as a win. For a """"Ranking Promotion Game"""" where you are at Division 1, you need two wins out of 3 games or top 10 in leaderboard of next rank game (undecided draft).
3) Losing points will bring you to 0 ladder points at a certain point. After losing at 0 points, you will demote, unless in Bronze 3 where nothing happens.
3.5) After promoting to a rank and being at 0 ladder points, you will have a grace period of losing (below top 50) for two games or after your first win before you demote.""

This person was very professional in explaining that Epic is always looking at ways to improve the game and to keep it “fun”, not just for casuals or pros, but just fun in general. 

On my way back from twitchcon I sat next to an epic employee who was genuinely interested in the displeasures I had with the game. First I told him it was the first game to get me back into competitive gaming since halo 3 but also the first game to get me back into casual gaming with my good friends from back in the day, but that it felt like it was nearly impossible to actually break out in the pro scene. You either need vouchers from pros or you need to be “randomly selected” to participate in an event like twitchcon and ball out to really get your name out there. 

His response was that the in game tournaments are going to basically be the new and improved way to get into the pro scene. No more “first come first serve” polls, no more only giving spots to known pros. If you earn it with specific numbers, you’re going to be invited to future events. No, he wouldn’t disclose what the “numbers” were. 

Next I talked about farming. It sucks. It’s slow. and how fights (in skirmishes / ranked at least) need in game incentives, like guaranteed mats back. I passed along a known Reddit idea of knocking down the build fight you just had and it would provide you with a specific % of those mats back, 25% , 40%, whatever it is once you knock it down. I also thought it would help with end game lag because all of the map is now empty of mats until late game. 

His response was an immediate “no”. Their goal is to have pros essentially not have a lot of mats at the end of games so they’re forced to fight, and not build each other out of zone / heal off. The also believe that the final couple of circles should only have 10-15 players and not 40, 60+, and they believe limiting mats may be the solution. He hinted that a boost in mats is something they’re always testing. 

He also explained that the shooting model with recoil is not coming to the game and that bloom is here to stay until they find something better than both. Apparently they had some pros test out the recoil based gameplay and it was unbelievably bad. The pros were AR-tapping each other in the head from 200+ meters away like it was nothing and no one could tell where it was coming from - he said it made the game feel like pubg in a sense and that it would completely ruin the gaming experience. Sounds hyperbolic but regardless, that’s what he said. 

TLDR; 

- In-game events will be the new way to break into the comp scene. 
- we’ll never get mats back from destroying builds
- mat cap is surely coming, probably as a test first
- faster farming (like in blitz) will probably be implemented as a test soon
- epic wants pros to fight in late game circles (with 10-15 people and not 40-60 all building each other out into the storm) so this would be the reason for capping mats throughout the game 
- bloom is probably here to stay. They run tons of tests on private servers and have invited some bigger streamers/pros to try out different shooting models and blooms is *apparently* the best option as of now.

Pls take time to read (2 min),"So I have made a couple of post about this topic. Got a lot of feedback, so that’s why I’m making a new, improved, case for this. 
First of all, the reason FF was taken out of the game was because people killed each other on purpose, this won’t be a problem in competitive unless you don’t take it seriously, but the main part would. There isn’t random squad or duos so you know each other, and as I said, if your still team killing that’s your personal problem in the squad. 
Well enough of why it was disabled. 
I think that FF would increase the skillgap, as so many people think it should be, because there will be punishment for playing “stupid”. I have taken a long time to consider if it only should be for splices and all type of grenades, or if it should be for all guns. 
And to be honest, Idk which would help the game the most, but you are welcome to leave your opinion in the comments. 

Some of you asked if it would promote the hated turtling, and no, i don’t think it would, because the only way to counter turtling isn’t just to splode the opponents building while you teammate is standing right in the solids area. Neither is it to spray on top of each other with fully loaded smg’s. 
You guys used the example with nick and ayden, and the play style they used, would definitely still be viable, as they didn’t stand on top of each other, but on the opposite side of each other (hope that made sense)

If you’re still curious about something or disagree, then ask me or let’s have a discussion about it.

The amount of shield was decent. Finally you werent fucked because entire Greasy Grove gave you 3 mini shields.Finally you could get to 100 shield without waisting stuff. 



I played a lot of squads normal mode the last 2 days in scrims but also just with normal friends and I noticed that the amount of shield drops is SO LOW that it is total RNG who gets a shield and who doesnt. 



And lets be honest. Having 100% shield and a green pump might be better then having a golden heavy pump with only 100 hp. Shield is so god damn important in the game.




I know this is not actual prove but yesterday I looted Greasy Grove and we litteraly had 50 shield on 1 out of 4 players. Thats all. Like 15 chests opened. 10 baloons. 1 shield.



Or just know, I cleaned entire Lazy Links and found no shields at all. How RNG can this game even be when there is the possibilitie to look like 6-10 chest and find no shield at all. 


With the zombies though you where able to actually heal up and farm shields and other ultilitie items.

218,asdaasasdsasdfas,1541325506,9u2a2o,108,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9u2a2o/ranked_mode_custom_lobbies/,1,Ranked Mode &gt; Custom Lobbies,"I’ve been seeing a lot of post lately saying that we should be getting custom lobbies. Personally I don’t like the idea of custom lobbies because then we would never be able to play against a pro player because they will be scrimming among themselves as pros. I think, and I’m sure everyone else here does too, that we need a ranked mode for us “sweaty” and “competitive” player that plays to win.

Scrim lobbies right now are super inconsistent with players and end game are a joke if your lobby doesn’t consist of at least 30 people since not everyone or much of anyone survives and it usually just becomes another public lobby game.

A ranked mode would one give us motivation to keep grinding the game to improve and play against people of similar skill instead of being a stomp by a good player versus a player that can barely build. This will also help get your name out there and show others that you can win. 

Why ranked &gt; customs? I’m imagining a rank system like league of legends or counter strike where around people under gold will be like a public lobby that just plays to play which is not bad in any way. They just aren’t the super tryhards. Anything higher is skilled players and then there is like the diamond and super elite rank where everyone is like in a skirmish game or something. This way we would be playing against diffeeent people which might consist of pro players too with variety of different skills.

Problem with rank mode and why epic doesn’t want it? It’s probably because they don’t want this game to lose out on its player base and want to keep it as audience friendly as possible. They want kids to just have fun playing video games and occasionally getting smashed by daequan or ninja and brag about it to their friends. You can’t have this in rank, people will be camping, players won’t just casually kill a pro/streamer or won’t be killed by them. Stream sniping would be a big problem because positioning mattters (example would be league of legends).

I personally think ranked mode should be implemented because this game has a very competitive aspect to it. Everyone is out here for the victory Royale screen and some players passion is greater than others. Some people want to experiment their skills on other skilled players instead of playing weaker opponents. Playing with bad players will dull your skills and some people just get the thrills from a good fight. Epic makes tourneys and prize pools going up to millions of potential dollars and it would be nice to see them try to have a real system to test players skills.

I haven’t enjoyed a game this much since arma 2 days/H1Z1 BR. 
Has Fortnite had its ups and downs with balancing/items, sure. 
But holy SHIT has this game not been fucking amazing since season 3/4. 
Epic has allowed me to play with high school friends that play console that I haven’t played games with since sophomore year call of duty days.
Look, we’re in a stage of gaming where almost all games are pre alpha/not worked on quickly.
Epic has kicked ass in giving us a game that we can look forward to coming home and playing.
I’m rambling about stupid stuff now and all of this will probably be removed from auto mod or whatever.
I know there’s a million posts like this for Epic, 
But all I wanted to say is fucking thank you, for giving us PC players a game we can fucking enjoy with friends. A competitive game that I can get better and better at as the ceiling continues to grow as you build.

You can't finish a fight that goes more than a story off the ground anymore because people fly away. Yeah I can fly to them too but now they've reset at a location of their choosing and attracted the whole side of the map to join in as well. So as soon as you finally kill that guy, you basically get chain third partied until the game is over or you've cleared half of the map. The NPCs, IN A PVP GAME MIND YOU, prevent any kind of moment's rest to heal or gather yourself no matter if you are in the air or on the ground, not to mention the crazy bug that come with them. 

One game in top 5 a hive spawned on top of me and I couldn't build or move. What fucking idiot made the call to make no building aloud near the hives? The next game a giant zombie bugged into the ground and stole a kill from me and then took 40hp off me while i scrambled to find where he was after he broke my structure out. What a terrible fucking taste that left in my mouth. I feel worse for my opponent. 

I hate to add more to the doom and gloom that has been going around but it just chaps my ass to see epic sitting on a golden goose egg of a game that many of you and I LOVE and watch them possibly start to take the game down a tragic path.

The pump crosshair is really bad as when i played with custom X crosshair i would hit more shots on my enemys.

Also add a feature to change its state kinda like csgo did, some people would love static crosshairs over dynamic ones.

TL:DR at bottom

In case you missed it, Epic buffed the Deagle to do 150/157 damage to walls (purple/gold) and do a minimum of 50/52 damage to players/cube monsters (purple/gold.) This means that a purple Deagle will always one shot a Wood structure, two shot a Brick structure, four shot a Metal structure, and one shot a fresh Brick/Metal structure. The base damage buff has also allowed it to effectively replace a sniper rifle (if that’s how you’ve been using it.) We’ll start with the structure balance changing, then the damage buff, and finally, it’s impact on the game, now and in the future.

Although Brick and Metal is objectively better stats-wise than Wood, most players still opt to use Wood in build fights, even if they have Brick and Metal readily available. This is mostly due to how easy it is to get Wood compared to Brick and Metal, but that’s besides the point. Until the Deagle becomes more noticed by players, they will continue to use Wood in build fights, which means you, the Deagle wielder, are able to one shot through their defense. *You basically have a seven-shot Heavy Sniper to pressure your opponent with,  and you can accurately hip-fire with it.* If you missed the pressure Dual Pistols provided, than the Deagle is a great substitute. When your opponent is healing, you may not be able to slip shots through turbo build, but if they’re healing in a wood cube, then it is much easier to catch them off guard with it. Pros usually get 1000 of each mat of course, but it can still one shot any fresh build to apply pressure and try to shoot their build and slip through their turbo build.

The base damage buff from long range has made the Deagle much more satisfying to use. If your opponent is unlucky enough to find shields, you can hit them in the head for a clean 100 damage headshot kill. To any former Counter Strike players like myself, the Deagle finally feels like a Deagle: you are rewarded for having good aim and taking time to line up your shots. Unlike most pistols, the Deagle is actually viable from distances greater than 20 meters. In summary, the Deagle has turned into a hit scan sniper of sorts. Whether it is overpowered or not only time will tell, but right now the Deagle’s damage makes it a very appealing choice, and not many people are complaining about getting headshot from 200 meters from one.

The greatest thing about the buff of the Deagle is it hasn’t messed with the core mechanics of the weapon: if you have good aim, it is a good weapon; if you have great aim, it’s a great weapon; if you have Shroud aim, it’s a god-tier weapon. Nothing has changed about that. Whether people will start trading their sniper out for a Deagle is questionable; I still rarely kill people carrying it past mid game. 

**So what has changed about this weapon that may make it game-changing?** TL:DR; it’s the utility it provides. So long as people keep fighting with Wood, the Deagle will have its place in the game to shoot through your opponents build. No other weapon can do so much burst damage, from point-blank and long distance, and can provide the utility the Deagle has right now. Should Deagle ever become meta, it could start making opponents  farm Brick or Metal more to defend against its strong structure damage, which in turn could make every other gun do less to structures since Brick and Metal are much stronger than the current Wood meta. This is all speculation of course, and probably wouldn’t happen since people who didn’t carry the Deagle before still don’t seem to now. But it doesn’t seem impossible for a gun focused on destroying structures to change the way we play (for reference, see SMGs.) However, I loved the Deagle before the buff, and I love it even more now. I even think it could be discussed if it should be re-added to Supply Drops since they’re so much more valuable.

This topic is important enough for a thread of it's own. While there's several good points in that thread, like ranked being neccessary and pro/streamer-scene being too harsh on up and coming talent, it's important to understand why this works this way, which I'll explain in this thread. I'll quote a section of his post;

&gt; Tournaments and pro scrims basically consist of the same 100 or so players that all share the same etiquette/unspoken rule that drops will not be contested, and it seems like anyone who does contest is either a 'clout chaser' or just has some 'personal vendetta' against certain players. This is absolutely ridiculous and immature. This subreddit has many flaws but seeing liquid mock it for this point in particular is beyond stupid.

The reason why pros/streamers/teams hate the fact that people land on ""their spots"" and why they make such a big deal out of it is because the early game is completely RNG based. The only thing you have some control over is getting a few seconds lead through the landing system, which is so easy to fuck up even the best will fail at times, and even then you only have two choices - either land on a guaranteed weapon, or land on a chest. Neither of these choices are good, and it's impossible to decide which is the best. If you land on the one weapon, like an AR, you're immediately at a disadvantage if the other guy is close to you with a shotgun. If you land on a chest, you're basically rolling the dice and can end up with something amazing or something completely useless. We've all gotten the Tfue classic, grey burst and bandages, enough to know what I'm talking about here. And sad as it is, that's one of the chests you're most likely to get. 

Now, I could expand on how the early game goes but I'm going to assume most people willing to read about this already know so I'll do it short; They try to farm whatever they can, take the fight when they have to - and it's usually a complete shit show. If they're close to the same level, nobody wins. They use all their mats, ammo and shield, and they either die now or die later because of the circle, or they don't have enough time to loot and farm, and so on. Essentially fucking over both parties.

The main fault lies with Epic and how the game was fundamentally constructed. And stuff needs to change. In my opinion, zombies and everyone can fly is not the way to go, but that's for another thread.

Hopefully that cleared some stuff up for someone out there. I'll PM the guy from the gatekeeping thread to make sure he sees this post.",FortniteCompetitive

- Should you be able to drop down quickly when using the re-deploy function?

- How does 3rd partying and disengaging change the meta?

- Would a cooldown timer or a certain amount of re-deploys benefit or hinder gameplay?

Keep discussion relating to the topic set. Remember that the [sub rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/fortnitecompetitive/wiki/rules) still apply.

I have played fortnite ever since season 2, and I feel like my aim is holding me back. I have decent knowledge of the game, my building skills arent bad aswell but my aim is very inconsistent. I either hit some really nice headshots, or whiff every shot. This occurs often in shotgun fights. When I miss those shots my confidence decreases and I continue to miss half of my shots which are often easy to hit. What should I do?

If you want the customization that comes with PC stop asking epic to change or add things that they simply cannot add with the flip of a switch and buy a PC. If you can’t afford one then suck it up for the time being and save up for one. Adding things like turning off shadows and changing other graphics settings can’t just be added over night and I’m not even sure if they can add it since consoles are owned by Microsoft and Sony (not positive if it’s up to them or not) but seriously I’ve been seeing more and more post about these request like they’re something epic is just keeping from you because they hate console. If it were an easy switch it would’ve been done in the beginning. There is no doubt you have a advantage playing PC fortnite competitively compared to playing it on console but if you want to be equal to PC players then buy a PC. Seriously tho, if you want a better gaming experience don’t expect it to come from a piece of hardware that maxes out at 60-90 frames. Grow up ",FortniteCompetitive

The lack of competition that the top pro players face is a joke. Tournaments and pro scrims basically consist of the same 100 or so players that all share the same etiquette/unspoken rule that drops will not be contested, and it seems like anyone who does contest is either a 'clout chaser' or just has some 'personal vendetta' against certain players. This is absolutely ridiculous and immature. This subreddit has many flaws but seeing liquid mock it for this point in particular is beyond stupid.

It seems to me like the pro discord that most of the top players use has far too many barriers of entry, and that players can get blacklisted for the most ridiculous reasons. This isn't just a theory either, it has happened in the past. Neace was only accepted after making a big deal about it, so who knows what happens behind the scenes with other players that didn't get so lucky.

The game needs a ranked system, or a discord that is run by impartial people who are always willing to accept new talent, otherwise, it will just stay as the same 100 or so pros all holding hands around the campfire, never willing to contest others. Therefore potentially some of the best hidden talents are never even being given a chance.

I'm tired of seeing the same names time and time again. It's surely time for things to change, otherwise competitive fortnite will remain this in this stagnant state, with the best talents never being given a chance to compete.",FortniteCompetitive

I’m thinking the same thing. All I ever see about controller vs PC is, “aim assist is OP and Aydan abuses aim assist” and the reply, “well controller can only use their thumb while PC players use their whole hand”. I want to explain my opinion. From all that I’ve seen, Aydan’s aim is better than that of any PC player due to aim assist. Look, for the average player, aim assist is just as good as mouse and keyboard aiming in general (it might be harder for average controller players to flick but they are better tracking enemies at long distances; it balances out kind of is what I'm saying). But once you get to Aydan and Nickmercs’s level, it becomes an advantage even against the best aimers on PC. With your thumb, once you get good, you know how much you need to push the stick and what direction to push. It is easy to push in a certain direction but the difficult thing is how hard you need to push. With aim assist, you can push a little too hard and a little too little and it will still be fine. Also aim assist does a little tracking for you. So for example, Aydan goes for a shotgun headshot on someone. Just flick in the direction of their head, ADS and shoot right away. The aim assist will hit there head and even if the person moves a little left or right then the aim assist will help track the head for a little (but you only need a little since you’re shooting right away). This combined with how aim assist works (you get more aim assist as you ADS) allows experienced controller players to flick, ADS and shoot with good accuracy. Also when someone is close range, you can spam ADS and shoot and it will basically lock onto them (what people consider aim assist abuse). You can see Aydan do this whenever he uses an SMG. I will repeat this again for people. I am not arguing that aim assist is OP, I’m arguing it is an advantage for players who are really good at it such as Aydan when compared to people who are really good at aiming on PC. Here’s some evidence. People say Tfue’s aim is really good. Personally I think he aims just as well as any other pro player or big streamer. He’s my favorite streamer and if he did have incredible aim I would say so but I don’t see solid evidence telling me that he’s better at aiming then any other pro. It would help my case if Tfue had insane aim but I’m trying to be honest and unbiased here. Just watch him 1v1 Aydan. His shots hit for way less than Aydan’s. Aydan consistently hits good shots. Also I'm going to talk about building. For the average person it is more difficult to build and edit on controller than on PC. But then again, with all the new Fortnite updates for controller building and editing, the limit for how good you can get at building vs PC is almost gone. Aydan is a beast at building. In fact I barely see any disadvantage that Aydan has. This is again evident in the 1v1 against Tfue. He’s taking, losing and then retaking high-ground all the time. He’s also editing completely fine and caught Tfue a couple times editing on him. Also in competitive Fortnite, build battling is not a huge thing since mats are so valuable end game and while you build battle their will be third parties shooting from everywhere. Often it isn’t worth it to full on build battle. Most of the time there is a slight build battle. Someone takes high ground. The person on low ground will box themselves in and then try and disengage (even easier with glider redeploy now). The person high often disengages too since it’s risky to try and 1v1 someone camping in their 1 by 1 without a partner. Also the only other time build battling may be a thing is for end game high-ground but those also don’t last long at all. Also there is a reason controller players dominate tilted and why many pros don’t contest. Vivid mentioned this the other day when he got back from TwitchCon. They know about this, specifically aiming where there is quite a significant advantage for pro controller players especially at close range. There also isn’t much building early game which helps controller players and why Nickmercs has success there (also because he plays pretty smart but I think we can all agree he isn’t the best at building).

Anyways I don’t like how controller players compete with PC players. I don’t have a solution for Epic and I understand why Epic doesn’t separate them (there aren’t many controller pros when compared to PC pros AND they would either have to give more money or split the prize pools, both of which will hurt Epic since for example splitting the prize pool won’t make it seem as appealing to viewers and people would get mad about how there are so few controller pros and they are splitting the prize pool evenly or if they don’t split it evenly there would be other obvious complaints). I just made this post because people are so impressed that Aydan and Nick gets a lot of kills in tournaments and are the “Tilted Tower Kings”. It isn’t fair that controller players are being put together with PC players, but oh well life isn’t fair. Don’t get me wrong Aydan is a beast and very talented, I’m just saying I wish they could be separated. Is there even any other competitive shooter where controller players compete with PC players? I don’t think there is. Like on LAN people should be able to bring their own mouse and keyboard but having people with completely different aiming and button systems compete together can never be “fair”. I’m not saying aim assist is OP and it should be nerfed, I’m just pointing out there are differences and no matter what you can never make controller and PC equivalent in difficulty.

Aydan and Nickmercs are undoubtedly incredible, talented players. I’m not trying to undervalue their performance or say it's easy for them because it definitely wasn't, just wishing we could somehow have controller players compete separately from PC players.

They're another alternative to Rifting with the introduction of the Re-Deploy, and are amazing for rotations. I haven't really fought them in a build fight too often, but they can be easily taken out together with a shotgun shot or two, and you can regain any highground you may have lost.

I really still can't believe there's no test server for this game, the lack of communication with the community in general is quite worrying in terms of the future, why do they not want to be open about the changes when they're so drastic a lot of the time? it feels like there's no inbetween when it comes to change, they're either all or nothing, no minor buffs or nerfs, no compromise with things that people are conflicting over in the community, i used to despise other games for dropping very very small changes on things, but now i have such a better understanding of why, opposed to what epic do every time they change something, and most of these games also have extensive testing on test servers yet still follow through with smaller changes, why is it the game that's top of the market would avoid approaching either of these things? 

Another thing that's grossly annoying is the saturation of people suggesting boogie bombs should hit through walls and other absurd proposals of ideas, i feel like people don't truly think about what they're saying, just jump on the bandwagon of what everybody else is talking about, and now i'm seeing so many posts about this.  
Why have people suddenly started suggesting things go through walls? Why not suggest a minor buff on stink grenades for example, let's work on the things that correlate with the turtle issues that are already in the current game.  
Am i the only person that thinks boogie b's are completely broken and are simply ridiculously under-rated as they are? It's the only item in the game (that has stuck around) that offers 0 counterplay if you get hit by 1, especially combined with things like clingers, double barrel, you literally have to sit and watch whatever they choose to do which is so incredibly biased of a situation to occur with no downfall for the other player.  


Overall i guess i'm just really discouraged to play after the recent patches, i feel if EPIC just gave a little explanation as to their thought process i wouldn't even care that much, even if i strongly disagree, i would come to terms with why they're shipping things out like they do, it's simply obnoxious for a game that is top of the market to not be vocal with the community, they're trying to appeal to every single category of player, with 1 type of game mode (just talking standard solo, duo, squads) and implimenting massive changes, it's offputting to say the least, a lot of the time lately i wish i could just drop the game full stop but it's not possible because there's no substitution, nothing else offers what fortnite has, and no other game has intrigued me more than this over a 15 year period of gaming, i guess my emotional state has boiled up to this point because i'm so passionate about it, and seeing such lack of care towards what is probably the greatest/most popular game of the decade, seriously is just so infurtiating.

But with the announcement that Kaysid and Cowboy are TSM members this seems less and less likely. I have heard rumours that they are looking into him being Hamlinz DUO partner. This actually does make sense because he could call the shots and properly utilize Hamlinz elite mechanic skills. Still though nothing has been official.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing that no one has mentioned is the possibility of him signing with Faze. I think with the recent Success of Nate Hill and Funk Bomb the next logical decision is to sign funkbomb. At first I thought they might consider benching Jaomock and Tennpo and creating a god squad of Tfue,Cloak,nate hill and funkbomb. But when I was doing research for my next video I was reminded with how successful the duo of natehill and symfuhny were in the summer skirmish. Its possible that symfuhny could be waiting to find out if Faze will create a new comp team around Natehill and funkbomb having Symfuhny as a third option. Obviously that team (depending on the 4th) would be much better any team TSM could put forth. the possibly of a natehill, funkbomb,symfuhny, zexrow could put faze in the same category as Ghost with having 2 elite competitive squads to put forward at the potential winter skirmish/fortnite world cup in early 2019. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall I just wanted to hear everyones thoughts about where Symfuhny would end up. Do you think he will go to Faze ? TSM ? or will another organization come in and sign him ? Personally I would have loved to see him sign with TSM and play with Myth. Having more elite teams is just better for fortnite in the long run IMO and I would love to see Myth perform well at a competitive event but I am interested to hear what you guys think!

I'm going to be trying to use reddit a bit more but here's a bit of my backstory for people who don't know me.

&gt;!I used to be the Head Coach / Lead Analyst for Samsung's Fortnite team, I then moved over to Gen.G. I've worked with a lot of pro players such as Kenith, Pow3r, Myth just to name a few. I'm management for FNPL NA and EU. I help with the Practice Server NA and EU ""Pro Discord"" and I also stream VOD reviews and scout potential pro talent!!&lt;

I made a [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/Mg1a7nKO80o) explaining how we can study rotations in fall skirmish. This may not apply to a lot of your games, but it can. The map that I use, you're able to use it in your own scrim games. If you go to replay, you might be able to see general positions of players on the map, from there you can do what I do and identify rotations and identify how others behave. If you're an aspiring pro player, doing this for skirmish games  can be super useful. If you're just a Casual Player, you can do this in your games to identify general traits of players and how players behave in game.

In the video I also talk about bluffing using the auto-swap mechanic in Fortnite.  It's kinda hard to explain, but basically if you run out of wood, most people go to brick and then steel as they run out. Therefore, it's been programmed into the general audience that if you see  Wood - Brick - Steel; then the person must be low on material. Baiting with Autoswap is one of the few ways you can bluff in fortnite and have it pay off enormously, as it allows for a really fast tempo shift in the fight because the enemy is not expecting you to have 200-500 materials, they expected you to be running out. 

If you guys have any questions feel free to ask me here or in the comments of the video! I will do my best to explain :)

I'm new and I suck at reddit so I will try to figure things out as I go along.

Going further there is even another divide with those who prefer old-skill (ie: season 4 style gameplay) and those who prefer this hyper fast paced flying around everywhere style, and I would call it the current day version of blitz, only its forced down all our throats. I fear epic that you continue to go down this road of chaotic game-play just like most games do now-a-days valuing speedy playstyles that lack quality and producing quantity (ie: excessive new items and changes) that you will never return to a harmonious play-style that we once knew in the early seasons of this game. Its so clear that the game grew so fast that you had no choice but to keep producing new content new map changes to keep players enticed and excited to play,  and are now trying to milk it for all its got.

Unfortunately I can understand epic why you have done this, its what most companies do in todays market, value quantity over content and speed over quality. Good luck hope you guys are brave enough at one point to take a step back and turn this game around (or at least a division of the game as i am suggesting) that will slow this game down and create that awesome gaming experience we once loved.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Why are meta-defining changes like this announced every week with no warning whatsoever to players? I get that you might not want players to assume what the changes are before trying them out. However, this can be solved by using a TEST SERVER. You did it once for FSA. Do it again. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) What in God's name made you think that this change was good? Your reasoning of it ""promoting aggression and countering turtle-ing"" is so deluded it's actually mind-blowing. Who thinks of such ideas? Who approves of such stupidity?   All you have done is made the already OP explosives even more OP. I literally have to hunt for an explosive every game just to secure wins because if my opponent is not a bot/Epic employee (i.e semi-competent), it's next to impossible to counter him. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) This does not distract us from the Glider Redeploy mechanic that you introduced. You only seemed to discuss the explosives one cause of the well-deserved hate you got for it.

Playground 1 v 1s could be argued it doesn't include game sense, overall winnings don't showcase skill but a measure of luck, stats only compare you to the other people in those games.

With that being said, if when rating a Fortnite pro, people used a 20-80 scale, like baseball uses, you can start to get a better idea of how good a player is.

From worst to best is 20 through 80, going up by 5. Therefore, 50 is considered average, 45 &amp; 55 are below/above average, 60 is considered plus, 70 is plus plus and 80 is considered elite.

In baseball, you compare people only to other elite players, so most are between 45 and 55, with some 60s. Every once in awhile, you see a 70, but 75s and 80s are very rare.

In baseball, for hitters, there are 5 areas in which a hitter is rated (contact, power, speed, fielding, arm), then the rating for all 5 areas is averaged out to have a rating for the player.

In Fortnite, those areas would be **Aim, Building, Game Sense, Early Game, Late Game.**

Now, to compare a few players to show you how it would work.

||Aim|Building|Game Sense|Early Game|Late Game|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tfue|60|55|60|65|60|60|
|Poach|55|50|65|45|70|57|
|NickMercs|65|45|60|65|45|56|

Now, one of the things is that each category has many things to consider. Building includes editing, aim takes into account shotgun, AR &amp; sniper aim. Game sense has hundreds of factors, from when to push &amp; when to play conservative, how to push, what your surroundings are, where the enemy is &amp; what move they'll make, where to set up your base, etc. I considered early game when there is a fight at the POI you land at, while late game is once the circles start moving. Late game takes into account the kills you can get while late game, and if you can stay alive. 

Let me know if you think these are the right areas to rate a player in (these are meant to be all encompassing, instead of trying to rate 20 different areas then average it). Also, let me know what you think of using something like this as a way to rate players.",FortniteCompetitive

In this post I will try to explain why u can see fortnite our competitive games as a sport and how the dynamics should work to balance things out. And my perspective to move this game to a healthy and fun experience for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

First off: what makes a sport. I thought of this a lot the last few years in order to get a better understanding of coaching and the different aspects I can have influence in as a player and a coach. My general theory is this. 

A sport is a game of options: what and when decide how the game is played

\- What: the options u have trough mechanical skill.

\- When: the moment our combination of usage of your options related situation in the game (game intelligence) 

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of options is different in each sport and has effects in the way its played. Its mostly depended on input and control. How much input[\[tvdS1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/submit#_msocom_1)  can I give and is the input I give reliable. If there are a lot of options and control the better player mostly wins. If there are less options our control the chances that a better player wins drops down. If there is a option that cant be countered our reduced its counter intuitive to the game our sport and should be removed.

In a typical sport, u have an aggressor and a defender. This is mostly dependable on the amount of options a player has. If I have the ball in soccer, I have more options than my defender because I am in control. The defender will first have to limit my options before he can go aggressive our I will use my control to my advantage and will win the dual. The mini game in this scenario is as follows, the aggressor will try to keep as much options as possible wile the defender will try to limit the options of the aggressor as much as possible so he can have more control and thus more options. In fortnite it’s the same, if I have zone and high ground I don’t have to do anything to be in control. And if the enemy just rushes over without taking away my ability to shoot him he will lose. 

If u want to improve in a sport our game and already have the core mechanics (what)to the best of your ability and game sense (when) does not improve anymore, there alternative points u can focus on to get better. 

Speed, safety and effectiveness. This is mostly the difference in the top 5% of players. The difference between a good and great players is mostly the speed (gives players less time to keep there options open our to take away my options), safety (gives players less chances to take control our punish mistakes) effectiveness, the ability to push an advantage our to take control from the aggressor.

Difference in playstyles and healthiness in a game. In a great game and in most sports u have a lot of levels in witch u can use your (what) mechanical skill and (when)game sense. In a close corner fight, mechanical skill will be really important (hit your shots) , in a more open situation game sense will be more important (good rotations give a advantage) if a sport has mix of these situations it will be the most fun. Not all sports have and that fine but with games its better if u have both. (athletics like the 100m sprint is just a demonstrations of (what), Chess is a demonstration of (when). 

&amp;#x200B;

That was fun and all but how does this effect fortnite. First a observation from casual and competitive play

Early game:

In the early game it’s a bit of RNG so the amount of options u have are different each game and dependable on were u drop, this is fine and gives a less stale experience. The amount of options u have as a player are dependable of the amount of weapons, hp and mats u have. To create more options u first have to get rid of the enemy players so u have the time and space to obtain these essential parts. This is why u see a lot of fights early game in competitive play. And if the drop is bigger the fights get a bit slower and longer cause players will find space to farm and loot up. Some times a player finds a power item early game, which gives him an unfair advantage (mostly splodes, lamas and chugs) witch is not healthy for a game. Basic psychology tells us that a loss feels more bad than a win feels good. If this lose is through an unfair advantage of the enemy player it will feel really bad wile the winning player will not feel really great. And thus it not a good option to have in a game. If more than 1 team drops in a small place with not a lot of loot and mats all the players who land there have an disadvantage, this is why pro teams want to claim there spot cause they need the time and limited space to get as much options as possible. This is a fine game mechanic and just bad of the player who drop there, since u need time and loot its more favorable to land in a more crowded place if there is a lot of loot and to end the fight as fast as possible without giving the enemy players the space to create more options for them selves.

&amp;#x200B;

Midgame: in a game with a lot of options and control the midgame will mostly disappear, in basketball the team with the ball has a lot of options/control and if u defend in a big space u will not limit them and will lose. This is why u see the defending team moving back to there basked before they start limiting options from the enemy. If the defender has a lot of options u also see a demise in midgame cause the aggressor will not have a lot of control and will prioritize safety to not lose a lot of his options. This is typical for competitive fortnite. U wont see kills in the second and third circle because player are to good with the amount of options, control and space they have the circle and with building. And if u chose to go aggressive u will lose a lot of options quick cause u lose to much mats and hp from 3 partying while the loot u get is deprived of mats and shields cause the defending player will use all of his and has the time to pop all his mini’s mid fight. This is a lose- lose situation. In these circles u should have to fight for late game advantage. Sport example is this, if I win the midfield in soccer I have an advantage to go for a goal (endgame) cause I went aggressive in the midfield. if I lose the midfield while I play aggressive the defending team has a chance to score (counter) cause they won the midfield. So there is a win-lose situation which has effect in the endgame. If this is a lose-lose situation, no external incentive will chance the game for the people who play to win.

&amp;#x200B;

Endgame: here it’s a raw determination of position and skill. A great player will not succeed if he has a really disadvantage position cause of mistakes in the early and midgame. But if all players have the same position the better player will win. if u win the midgame u mostly have a advantage going in late game and if ure good u will mostly succeed. See the faze win on the Westworld ending at twitch con and the dominance of liquid with the north circles in the week before twitch con.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Healthiness of the game: an advantage should be obtained trough game sense, mechanical skill our taking risks in the game. Not pure luck. Options that have no counter are toxic and not a fun experience. While playing with all skill levels, can be fun. Its not a healthy place to improve cause if an enemy player has way more options, speed, safety and effeteness than u he will win. while u mostly have no idea how u could improve. So a normal playlist with all levels deserves to be there, a ssbm practice system also deserves to be there. To create a fun experience for al levels of play and a chance to improve your gameplay. Tournaments are a fun and interesting way to go but if there is no real practice mode there will be no real chance for players that don’t get into snipe scrims our costumgames. Smurfs can be a problem but the chance u run into a smurf is a lot smaller than a good player in a normal game and if somebody gets 20 kill in a game he should be ranking up so fast het needs a lot of time to get back. A minimum requirement will fix a lot of this. Ranks our bronze-dia standings should not have a place in a practice mode and will be for the tournaments.

My idea to move this game to a more fun and healthy environment.

We will start from patch 6.1 cause that was a great patch and exept some issues a healthy moment in time.

From the patch notes:

\- The Deagle buff is a great way to give more aggressive options without giving an unfair advantage

\- Stinkbom dropbuff is fine

\- The glider redeploy functionality is not a healthy chance to the game. It removes a lot of rotation options, high ground advantage, good building mechanics, risks and commitment for players. So u cant press your advantage as well as buffing defensive play. This will cause the game to have less layers and the game will feel more and more dull over time.

\- dual pistols have a place in this game, the jump shooting mechanic is great and should apply to all pistols to create more of a niche. The double crit can be a little excessive and can be nerved to 25% so a double crit will do 100-110 damage instead of 160ish

\- explosive damage penetration, speaks for it self (not healthy at all) 

\- cant say anything about balloons cause of the glider redeploy interaction, but is would be better if they would have a better interaction in game if they were more like atk’s and rifts (not as a loot spawn)

what feels is missing

\- The edit rotation mechanic is useless unless for stairs, can be chanced but will mostly better defensive play witch is already good enough.

\- The edit mechanic can be made faster and easier to use so lesser skilled players can better interact with it.

\- Knockknock here I come! Pickaxe interactions with turbo building, after destroying 2 structures that newly placed in a row with a pickaxe should take away the owning rights of that building place and give everybody the right to edit. This will give a healthy option to fight players that box without fazing our fully taking away somebody’s defense options

\- Midgame supply drops: power-loot and lamas should not drop randomly. 72 hours and others said this earlier and It can be a great way to get a midgame advantage and action.  A mix of 3 supply drops should land in the second and third circle with a pinpoint on the map. This can create more fight incentive and layers trough decision making and priority’s. while giving a good place for power items in this game:

o Weapondrop: Rpg, quatlauncher, grenade launcher, heavy sniper and miniguns with some ammo.

o Lamadrop: (flyinglama’s would be great!) with mats ammo and shields. 

o Utility drops: rift to go’s, bouncers and grapplers should only be obtained trough these drops. 

\- Farming caps, I think poach tweeted an idea like this before but I think its not the cap that should be better but the farming rate. A kill should give u 10% farming buff. So if somebody fight hard early game and get 3 kills they should get 30% more mats for smacking stuff over players that don’t kill.(example a Brik wall gives 16 stone, after I kill 5 players, the same brik wall gives me 24 stone)  This will give u the option to farm up after u had a lot of fights and give u the option to not get punched over aggressive gameplay without creating a snowballing mechanic.

my point in making this post is because all of us are thanking epic for doing such a great job “listening to the community” and i don’t mean to sound negative and ungrateful but the buff was clearly ridiculous, just from reading it in the patch notes we all knew it would cause problems, and yet somehow it made its way into the game, epic should do a better job of testing their changes they want to make before giving them to the public, kind of how overwatch has their ptr system in order to let everybody mess with the changes and give their input while their testing team could also work on changes, kind of uniting the community and devs to make the changes together, instead epic has adopted this system of making drastic changes, and if they don’t go well they just hotfix them a few days later, but you can’t constantly break your game and then fix it, that seems very irresponsible and doesn’t sit well with me",FortniteCompetitive

The whole point of this game has been having balance and consequences and with this feature there is literally NO consequence for bad decision making such as building high, bad rotations and getting stuck in the storm. A player has high ground on you? Fly away. You make bad decisions during a fight? Fly away. Take a fight outside the circle? Fly away. Yes it makes it easy to disengage but there has been multiple times where I have found myself chasing players around the map burning tons of mats. 

Ok it increases mobility, but epic have literally spent the last 3 seasons adding and testing loads of mobility items into the game just for them all to become completely irrelevant. There is tons of mobility already available to use so honestly I feel with the gliders it has become over saturated with movement. 

Third partying which has always been a strat is now absolutely crazy. There are games where I literally do not have time to heal because the fights just keep happening one after the other. I finishing fighting and I can hear another player gliding towards me and so on until I have no health or mats. 

There should be consequences for your actions and at the moment gliders are way too OP. Am I the only person who absolutely hates it? According to epic they’ve had positive feedback but I’m honestly struggling to have fun playing this game at the moment. ",FortniteCompetitive

So the reason this was added is to limit the amount of turtling during competitive matches, epic feels defensive play is too strong and aggression needs to be more heavily rewarded. Now I’m not going to touch on the explosive damage penetrating walls because we can all see why it is broken (damage that has no counter is not fair or balanced gameplay). So instead I’m just gonna touch on turtling itself.

Turtling is here to stay in competitive fortnite. The reason being is that it is the most effective tactic available to both make it to the end game AND get kills all while preserving resources in a competitive environment. For example, even if there was a skirmish week where the only way to get points was through kills and say every kill was 1 point we would still see people turtling for end game and that’s because it’s much easier to secure a kill on someone by holding mouse1 while they rotate than it is to build fight them early or mid game. 

So the question isn’t how do we prevent turtling it’s, how do we cut down the lobby by a reasonable number before end game. One idea suggested by 72hrs is that airdrops should be the only place where you can get splodes and rift to goes and they should be marked on the map so that teams can rotate to fight for them, this would add an incentive to win your drop spot and rotate to the crate to get these valuable items (also cutting down on RNG on who gets them). Currently the problem with fighting early is that you screw your self over for end game by taking a fight against another pro team. The fight is likely to drag on and you will lose both materials and health. I personally think epic needs to take a look at farming rates and buff it by 2x it’s current value so teams can feel comfortable farming back up after a fight. Finally the glider mechanic needs to be gone ASAP especially if farming rate is buffed. The glider redeploy makes it much easier to rotate and make it to end game that we’re seeing much higher numbers of players in these moving circles making it a mad chaotic dash to the new zone. 

This game in competitive currently acts in 3 phases 1) Win your drop/farming phase 2) Positioning phase 3) End game 

We need a way to make it so more people take fights during phases 1 &amp; 2 by incentivizing it in game and not via points.

Sorry if this came off as incoherent I’m not a great writer but hopefully I did a good enough job explaining myself to get a good discussion going. 



One more idea I just now had, what if there was an incentive to win (eliminate all other teams) your drop spot. Say every named POI had the ability to bet you points if you win that drop and the more potentially contested the drop is the more points you get, but if no one drops there with you, you don’t get any points. So say I drop pleasant with 2 other teams and me and my teammate are the last team standing in pleasant before a certain amount of time, we earn a point. What do y’all think? ",FortniteCompetitive

Pumps doing 237 was justified as you couldn't double pump. But there were endless CQC combinations. Heavy tac, heavy tac smg, heavy pump, pump heavy, pump tac, pump smg, double tac, tac smg, and probably even more. Every shotgun could compete with each other. For example, Heavy shotgun had more ammo and range, but couldn't 1 hit and had a smaller crosshair . Pumps had less range than a heavy, less ammo but could 1 hit. The argument that there was no variety in setups back then is nonsense because there was NOTHING to run back then. We barely had different types of utility and there was 2 power weapons. And just in case you're wondering, if double shotgun ever returned people would still prioritize splodes, or utility in competitive (because shotguns don't 1 hit walls anymore to counter turtling). And if you do run a secondary shotgun you're sacrificing your ability to kill anyone good turtling. ",FortniteCompetitive

In this post, I’ve listed the counters for every popular weapon in solo mode. Enjoy and feel free to add changes / suggestions in the comments.



Assault Rifle, Suppressed Assault Rifle, Burst Assault Rifle

Against all assault rifles, pushing the player or building a wall counters them. When pushing, make sure to add reinforcements to your stairs, like floors and walls so you can’t get shot down. If you want to stay in your base and are getting spammed, counter the spammer while they are shooting your walls with your own ar shots. This will force them to stop or take heavy damage. Make sure to change where you peek every time. (You can peek from the side of your stairs or a window edited in a wall.)

Clingers, Grenades, Rocket Launchers, Grenade Launchers, Quad Launchers

A general tip against all explosives is to either move very far or very close to the player. The player will risk hitting themselves with splash damage and will switch to another weapon if you get too close, and won’t be able to reach you if you are far away. You can also take random shots at the enemy while pushing with your ar/SMG. These are unlikely to hit, but anything helps.

Miniguns 

When fighting miniguns, you should get very far away or go to medium range. Moving too close to the player greatly increase the chance of getting hit and will probably result in taking a lot of damage or dying. Another way to counter miniguns is to god build. Normally, 
Turbo building is not enough to stop miniguns. However, if you god build, they will not hit you. To god build, you need a mouse with an unlockable scroll wheel. Bind scroll up or scroll down to place building, and use your scroll wheel when going against them. This will place faster than turbo building and prevent all damage.

Snipers, Hunting Rifles

The obvious counter to snipers is to move very close and shotgun them. However, if you decide to peek, make sure to make your peeks unpredictable (see Assault Rifle counter). You can also bait their snipe by quickly peeking and going back in your structure. This will usually cause the enemy to snipe, giving you time to push. Also, peeking hunting rifles is extremely risky as decent players can quickly line up the shot with your head and kill you.

Scoped Assault Rifles

Counter by either pushing them or shooting at them with snipers or your own scoped ar. When pushing, you don’t need to build as much reinforcements because they don’t shoot as fast as normal rifles which reduces their ability to break buildings. DO NOT peek with your own ar unless you know they are low or are at a very close range.

Shotguns

Building is the most effective counter against shotguns as they are extremely slow at destroying buildings.  If fighting a tac/double barrel with a pump or heavy, make sure to keep them a bit farther away and exchange shots. Theirs will do less damage than yours. If you have a take and double barrel and are fighting a pump/heavy, move close to them to out damage them. Don’t play too aggressive, as they could switch to an SMG or trap you. If an enemy with a pump or heavy shoots, quickly counter them with your own shot as the shotgun is still on cool down.

SMG, Compact SMG/P90

Turbo building is usually good enough to counter SMGs. Wait for the enemy to reload and quickly edit out and shoot them. When fighting enemies at very close range (inside 1x1), trap them or counter with your own smg or shotgun. Make sure to jump around them so they lose sight of you.

Traps

Countering traps requires a really fast reaction time. You need to quickly destroy them, move out of their range, or put a stair/pyramid to block them. Making sure every wall around you is yours is an easy way to die less to traps. 

Pyramids

The easiest way to counter them is to put your own pyramid and edit it. However, if your enemy has already placed a pyramid, jump around it and put a floor to catch yourself. A more advanced tactic is to put stairs after the floor at the right time to prevent damage from behind you. On the flip side, if your are the one on the high ground and you think the enemy will jump around your pyramid, put your own floor to block them. This will cause most players to fall.

This doesn’t eliminate turtling but it gives being aggressive more of an incentive. Like it you destroy an enemy wall within like 2 seconds of it being placed you gain a certain amount of materials. There’s probably better ideas out there . I really don’t think there’s a way to stop turtling without making 90% of the community mad.

So, a little insight into my thinking. Epic added the 25% damage through walls to counter turtling. Recently, ending the turtle meta has been a high priority to them. They’ve added stink bombs, nerfed walls, and more. Turtling is indeed a play style that Epic does not want, and that’s where I was thinking. Turtling is not a good meta to both us and Epic Games, and Epic is trying to remove it in poor ways. This is where Turbo building comes in. Hear me out.

Turbo Building in Season 3 was one of the biggest changes in all of Fortnite’s history, and, in my opinion, a bad choice by Epic. Turbo Building has made the skill ceiling and gap lower. It made it so anyone could hold mouse1 and spam walls down. You could now turtle and take no damage in your 1x1 by doing the same thing. Build fights are now drawn out and a waste of materials, along with limiting the need for the good timing with your builds.

I’ve seen a few content creators talk about this, primarily King Richard. He had a really good point that stuck with me regarding Myth and Fortnite in the past. Myth got popular because of his building skill before Turbo. Then, you needed timing with your builds and couldn’t just hold down mouse1. He got popular because he could build the best and the FASTEST. Building took a LOT more skill. Because everyone now has the ability to hold down their mouse, this skill level is much easier to reach and, in my opinion, TOO easy to reach. The skill ceiling is low. Building used to take a lot more skill.

Turtling. Epic does not like Turtling. Before Turbo, turtling was much more difficult. If someone was shooting your wall, you could not instantly place it; you had to time it, and often that wouldn’t work. Disabling Turbo is what would cause turtling to be nerfed hard, which is what Epic (and a lot of us since turtling is not a good play style to the general population) wants.

BACKLASH. If this were to happen, the backlash would be IMMENSE, so maybe make it a testing mode or LTM or something like that. I would just really like to see what impact this has on the game.

WHY IT WONT HAPPEN (sadly). Because turbo has been in the game for so long, it will be a huge change that will alter game mechanics hugely. Epic has had this for too long, and players are used to it sadly. I do not think this will happen, but I do think it would get what Epic and a lot of us want regarding turtling and skill ceiling done.

Thank you for reading my mega-essay. I’d like to hear your thoughts! :)

TLDR; turbo building was a bad change. It allows for too much turtling, which most of us do not want, along with Epic who has been making changes to stop it. It made it too easy to build, lowering the skill gap and ceiling (I think i’m using those terms correctly. Correct me if I’m wrong). 
Turbo building should be removed, but the player base is too used to it now. Epic is in a bit of a hole.

This change has allowed killing someone in a turtling easier. Before the only ways of killing someone in a turtle was stinks or replacing a wall/ shooting through which is impossible through regular turbo build. If someone is in a metal turtle holding mouse one on walls it is impossible to replace their walls or deal damage.
 
The  new change will allow the killing of players turtling much easier without using as much ammo as well and them not using as many materials. This would allow fights to end sooner and promote more aggressive gameplay in events such as the skirmish where routinely 70+ enter the final moving circles. 

Just a different opinion that I think the update should be used in at least one skirmish event.

I´ve noticed signicicant more build battles in public which I personally enjoy, and to speak of the earlier non-existent mid-game is now filled with action. I'm aware of all the various opinions about this feature, but I've noticed more negatively criticism than positive. It has also induced less importance of positioning, thus it eliminates a bit of the inherent RNG of a BR game. To be honest, positioning still is important but not as important as prior the redeploy feature. And because of this it promotes a more aggressive gameplay which involves building. It also eliminate the fear of getting knocked down which promotes building  further. Me, a mechanically good builder, have had an advantage because of this, and because of the bigger importance of building skills, have had more fun than last season. I feel like building is once again the major skill to possess, like it was earlier seasons, and I would like to see some modifications to the feature, but not remove it completely.

He’s a casual player, and the meta is being constantly changed for casual players to have a “high quality gaming experience”.

And I’m the Competitive player, the one that plays hours a day, completely only playing the game, just to get better. I’m not enjoying the game myself,
Zombies, SMG spams, the amount of damage I get by even though I put wall in front of me, and other things that effect to quality of life aspects, that don’t make me enjoy it.( Like *really*, I build over a guy and he says under me just spamming SMG bullets on my floor and I *still* lose, what?!?)

I’m not even complaining, but I just want this game to give better players the upper hand because they put in the time and effort( and maybe money) into this game.

Just fix the game, and move it to a more competitive stance rather than a casual stance. This will keep long term players into putting in more time and effort, and in a business stance, more money and more popularity, due to the better players giving better reviews on the game.

Before i get into listing them out i would like to say up until zombies were introduced i was easily a 20 -30 hours a week player. Everyday i would look forward to getting off work, going home and firing this game up. I would look forward to saturdays because i knew i would be able to stream this game for 6 to 10 hours. Once zombies were introduce my play time dropped to maybe 10 hours. I have no longer had the drive to play the game. I would still get the itch to play but once i fired it up and was subjected to the onslaught of zombies and the ridiculous noise blaring into my headphones they caused my desire to play went away instantly. I would still play but my sessions became a lot shorter and i would find excuses to stop playing altogether.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Removal of bounce pads** \- This was out of no where. No one was talking about them being OP. Neither the casual player base or the competitive players were talking about these at all. One day Epic removes them only to replace them with arguably the worst trap introduced to this game. Freeze traps are basically unusable. I literally drop them in game so they dont get in the way of cycling.
* **Glider Redeploy** \- This change is honestly not horrible but its not good. Fall damage has a place in this game since there is building. Mobility items are no longer a necessity because players can now build up and glide. You should be forced to think about how high you are building and carry something that can save you if someone shoots you down (launch pad, bouncers, new impulses).
* **Zombies** \- This update was mind blowing. Why did they think this was a good idea? I honestly felt like it was forced and a last min rush to throw something in the game for Halloween. The sound they cause is unbearable. You cant hear anything when they are around you except for the noise they cause. As far as i can tell very few people in the community actually like them in the game. The game is not PVE its PVP. Also, Epic seems to realize their mistake since they took them out of the Fall Skirmish. If they honestly thought they were a great idea wouldnt they have left them in the game for one of if not the biggest fortnite tournament to date?
* **Grappler** \- Another weapon put in the game so people do not have to build. This seems to be a trend with Epic. They seem to think the casual player base will be around forever. Whoever at Epic believes this nonsense should be fired ASAP because he will be the reason this game becomes irrelevant. Epic continues to introduce this type of update for the casual player base who does not care or want to learn how to build. What Epic does not realize is that these weapons are far more powerful when used by good players and increase the skill gap even more. I dont know how Epic does not see this. It was very apparent with bounce pads even though no one was complaining about them.
* **Explosive update** \- the 25% damage through structures is INSANE! Not only do people have to deal with splode spam now they also have to deal with getting damaged by it. What exactly is the counter to someone with high ground spamming you with rockets? You used to be safe by boxing yourself in until they ran out but now if you choose that you are dead. If you try to move you are dead. Literally the only thing you can do is hope you have impulse or grappler or launch pad bc its the only thing getting you away fast enough to reset. I am pretty sure this was another change Epic added for the casual player base. The casual player base would not box up when getting hit by a rocket so they wont care about damage coming through structures. The RPG was already the most OP weapon late game and now it just got even stronger. I really would like to hear Epics reasoning on this one.
* **Removal of dual pistols** \- Why? Honestly just why? I did not hear many complaints about these. I used them early game in place of a shotgun if i couldnt find a shot gun. A lot of people liked them. These were honestly the one of the best early game drop weapons behind the shotgun and i am really dumbfounded why these were even removed.
* &amp;#x200B;

There are a ton of other things i could include but they were introduced a while ago, further back than the grappler. This is just a small example of things introduced recently to the game that have caused a lot of uproar by the majority of the player base. I understand that there are some people that like these updates but understand you are in the minority.

&amp;#x200B;

Epic continues to try and win back/ keep the casual player base and for some reason Epic does not understand that these players WILL move on no matter what. They are just playing because other people are playing, their friends are playing etc. Once a new game comes out they will move to it. This is what the MAJORITY of people who play games do. In order to keep your game relevant you need to not alienate the core player base. The people who like the game and will continue to play the game even though new games are being released. There is a reason CSGO is still as popular as it is today. Is it extremely popular? NO! But it still has a large player base and its extremely impressive for a game that old to still have such a large player base.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a lot of things Epic has done right with this game, its why its currently the most popular game ATM. However a lot of the updates they are introducing are counter productive and are geared towards a player base that will eventually leave whether or not that update was put in the game. They continue to add items to the game that are meant to support the casual player base that does not care to learn how to build not realizing that they are actually far more powerful in good players hands and therefore **increasing the skill gap that already exists even more**. Epic needs to slow down with the changes they are introducing into the game. Too many things are changing way too fast and i personally feel like they are not thinking long and hard enough about what they are doing to their game. It is their game and they can do what they want with it but if they want the game to survive in the long term they need understand the casual players will end up leaving no matter what.",FortniteCompetitive

That’s why the fortnite we have now has strayed so far away from its original mechanics it’s unrecognizable.

Toward the end of season 4 the strength of smgs were perfect and a great counter to double pump and explodes were annoying but manageable, I feel like the buffs they have plus the rocket limit, structure nerf, and a couple of season 5 additions along with the season 4 would make a great game. Building wouldn’t be the only option, you’re still able to counter smg with double pump but would be punished if you missed you’re shots, you’re structures aren’t invincible but still strong.

Maybe I am being to nostalgic but with the changes they made this patch I think it’s nearing time for epic to start a clean slate.",FortniteCompetitive

For those who don't know, the current patch schedule is a content patch followed by usually a bug fixing oriented patch on the following week. The patch following has never really been too consistent, it can range greatly on what it does.


I think we have gotten to the point where Epic are really just running out of ideas for these content patches and are legitimately just throwing together things at the last minute. This is being done just for the sake of saying there's something new being added every two weeks. This results in the new content either being extremely useless/lack lustre (Ice Traps, Six shooter, pretty much most items) or being completely game changing/meta defining (Grapplers). 

For months now the performance of the game has only reached lower and lower levels. With a multitude of bugs and exploits being implemented due to the lack of proper play testing and constant new content. 


New content legitimately doesn't matter if the game can't run properly. I would gladly take no new content for weeks, even months if it meant that the game was finally able to settle down and sort though all the performance issues and bugs that have become apparent.

However the dualies seemed decently balanced (more consistent but less potenital damage than other shotguns) and enough people used them to not warrant them being removed.

"" Advantages and Disadvantages of this change:","This post will be split into 3 parts, The advantages, disadvantages and my thoughts on the change.

**Advantages:**

\&gt; Turtling will no longer be as  effective, as the rockets or other explosives will be able to do damage through the walls.

**Disadvantages:**

\&gt; Explosives are extremely unbalanced, considering that they can do damage through pretty much anything, without a counter. (If you attack someone with an rpg, you will take some damage)

\&gt; Makes building less effective, increases reliance on RNG.

&amp;#x200B;

**My thoughts:**

\&gt; It seems like a good idea, but without the addition of damage spread, it doesn't seem fair to take 25 damage through a wall. Grenade launchers have 6 bullets in the clip, meaning they can do almost 150 damage through builds without reloading. That is downright unfair.

\&gt; A better idea might be to allow all guns to shoot through walls and do a reduced amount of damage. This reduces the reliance on RNG to counter turtling. Of course the downsides to this would be that bulding is inneffective when it comes to defending against damage, but if the bullets only went through one layer, it would not be that bad.

I feel like the way they handled the situation, in my opinion, was very poor considering he is the owner of such a big org. Ill brick it back to the beginning when we first heard about the event.

So my partner Bmitch and I were lucky enough to compete at The Fall Skirmish at twitch con. We have been practicing for this event ever since it was announced that there will be an open Fortnite event at twitch con. We practiced a couple of spots and ultimately decided to start practicing one particular spot which was the old Villian Lair near the west side of the map. I came up with the idea of going there and it was going well for us so it stuck with us. Some background on my partner Bmitch, he is a viewer in Makz's stream and is actually a 3-month sub to him, He doesn't really watch him that often because me and Bmitch actually stream almost every day, basically when we play, we stream. It just so happened that we had the same heat (heat 4) and in the 4 games we ended up fighting Makz and Rocx twice. The first time they killed us off spawn and the second time we ended killing them off spawn. After the 4 games were over we, unfortunately, did not qualify for the grand finals. And this is where the shady stuff goes down. As we are walking out of the player area Makz and his partner are standing there WAITING for us and the first thing they said to us was ""Why?"" we didn't know what he was talking about. They insisted that Bmitch and I tried to ""Sabotage"" the tournament for them just because we landed at the same spot as them. Excuse me? I didn't know you could own spot on a map in a video game. Me and Bmitch tried to explain to him that we have been scrimming at that same spot for at least 1-2 months and we go there every day. Nothing we said to them mattered to them, Their egos were too big at that moment. They wanted to believe that and me and my partner actually would spend our OWN money to come to twitch con so we could kill some soar members??? They ended up both tweeting how their ""viewers"" purposely landed with them to kill them. I'm honestly was so shocked that someone could actually try and blame another team for their own loss and then feed their OWN twitter followers sad excuses. Bmitch and I really just wanted to come and compete and have a good time which we did, but it's really off-putting when you grind really hard for events like this just for some big name to call you out and ""sabotaging"" because they know you are a really small competitor and get away with it. Imagine someone like Tfue lands at the same spot and kills them... You think they would have gone up to Tfue and Cloakzy and called them out? Nope. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys want proof that we have been practicing that same spot you can look at my VODS and we have been going to the villian lair for at least the past month. [https://www.twitch.tv/ogkix/videos/archive](https://www.twitch.tv/ogkix/videos/archive)

Also, I first shared my thoughts in response to parallax's tweet, which you can find here:  
 https://twitter.com/100T\_Parallax/status/1057702458045140998   


My thoughts/suggestions:  


I love how zombies have reduced the amount of ""rng"" Fortnite had before. You can now farm your way to a decent load out at the cost of time (it takes valuable time to farm zombies, which means that you are essentially not farming mats or gaining positional advantage).  
This being said, I don't think that they are perfect, and whilst my thoughts aren't thought out to perfection, this is what i've come up with over the past week or so thinking about it:  


\-Zombies should not drop anything above blue tier (remove purple/golds. So there would no longer be an absolute crazy amount of rifts/rpgs).

\-Zombies should stop spawning after the third circle. (In part for two reasons)  
1. Engagements late game are just awful with the hordes of zombies running around  
2. You should go into late game with what you've prepared yourself with. You shouldn't be able to make up for late   
game mistakes by just shooting zombies until you are back to 100 shield.

&amp;#x200B;

\*No longer referring to zombies, but just rng in general

&amp;#x200B;

\-A bit skeptical on this idea, but i'm interested to hear feedback on it: Chests no longer drop anything above blue tier either. With this change implemented, I believe that chests should be changed to spawn 100% of the time. (I believe this would reduce early game rng whilst not allowing for someone to get overwhelmingly lucky and snagging a full gold load out from some chest intensive spot like... tilted? or west world)  


\-At this point supply drops are now extremely valuable and would be the only way to really power up your load out and/or get something that ultimately gives you an advantage over your enemies. These things would now be contested for and actually sought after. As of right now, no one cares unless they are dropping on your head.  


  


To end:  
\-I think an issue with my system is that the ONLY source for purples/golds are rng floor loot or the supply drops. Maybe that's a little much tbh. So I'm sure there could be some tweaking here and there, but as I said, this what not thought out to perfection.

&amp;#x200B;

\-I'm not completely set on the ""idea"" of zombies. But the gist of it is nice. Have areas that are clearly valuable because they posses loot that you can contest. But these areas require some amount of time to get this loot. This ultimately results in a trade off: Sacrifice time for better loot. As noted before, sacrificing time means you are sacrificing other things like positioning, mats, etc...  


\-Also, I was mainly thinking about this from a ""competitive"" stand point of view and not really considering the casual side of things. So I think this would only really be practical if Epic were to release a different ""rule-set"" for games that are played competitively and ones that are played casually.",FortniteCompetitive

*Set right D-Pad to Jump, then map that to your left paddle
*Set X to ""Edit""
*Then change ""Switch Mode/Edit"" to just ""Switch Mode""

After I made the switch I realized I pressed X to jump out of the battle bus but after a few games you'll get used to using your left paddle to jump out. And now you have instant editing with X, which previously was barely used because I jump with my left paddle. Additionally, you can set edit on your right paddle but I prefer pressing X.

**(Optional) Build Controls:**
Unbind ""Rotate / Repair / Change Trap""

Rotating builds doesn't really come up that often and I unbound it to prevent accidentally rotating my ramps. You can repair builds in combat mode but all this is optional. With glider redeploy and fast falling, I don't see much use in rotating ramps.

You can mess around to find the best way to confirm or reset edits but I like having confirm on the same button as the edit button and reset at L2 feels comfy. I also don't like pressing my joysticks.

**(Optional) Settings:**
""Sprint by default"" to On
""Edit Mode Aim Assist"" to Off
""Auto Pick Up Weapons"" to On
""Auto Sort Consumables to Right"" to On
""Vibration"" Off

Now all this comes down to preference but I've been playing on these binds and I feel like they have been good. I'm also curious what configurations everyone else has or if there are things I can change to improve my binds. Did anyone come up with anything they feel like has given them the edge?",FortniteCompetitive

During this time we’ve been collecting internal data and monitoring constructive feedback from all of you. We understand that not all players agree with this change, but we would like to continue with this functionality in the game based on the positive results we’ve been seeing.

&amp;nbsp;

As this feature remains available, we’ll begin making quality of life changes to its functionality. First of which will be prioritizing Glider audio over weapon audio within certain ranges, this will begin in v6.21. We also plan on adding additional changes in future updates.

&amp;nbsp;

Thanks for the discussion and feedback you’ve provided. Please continue letting us know how we can improve this feature, your thoughts on its effect in matches, and any other feedback you may have as we continue to work on Glider Re-deploy.",FortniteCompetitive

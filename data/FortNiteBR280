He said the crack is 12 miles deep and 30 feet wide. This most likely correlates to the crack we see in the Fortnite world. He also said that the crack could open at any time and everything would fall in. By everything he also means all the sand in the desert area where the Durr Burger is located right now. This could be the explanation for the map becoming a desert theme. Any thoughts on this?

Epic has done an amazing job and I’m a huge supporter of what they’ve been doing with weapon balances and changing the meta. 


However, as someone who plays a lot of squads the recent changes to rocket launchers, grenade launchers, mini gun and C4s are slowly ruining the game for me. 

I’ve noticed that it’s getting a lot harder to win games unless you have explosives of your own. Going against a team with all of those and mini guns make me feel completely useless and that there’s no point in trying to fight them. With less players on your team it’s seems almost impossible to beat a team with explosives too.

I just hope I’m not the only one feeling this way and the rest of the community can show their voice so epic can make some changes that doesn’t involve 100 ways to counter building.

2) have them detonate at the same time. There’s nothing more annoying than boxing yourself in only to die. C4 should explode at the same time, not on a delay so one breaks your wall then the other kills you.

A shotgun build meta in my opinion would be the best or something like late season 3 or early season 4.

2) Drum gun is absolutely broken including guns like the smgs and mini gun. These three guns disable building, their firerate is incredibly high compared to other guns, their magsize is decent to incredible, and they are all very accurate and sometimes better than shotguns close range.

3) Explosives are meant for destroying buildings but do it way to well for weapons such as the remote explosives which aren't even fun to play against. On top of that now explosives such as the rocket launcher and grenade launcher now do it very well too which destroys buildings so easily it's not even fun to play against. The max rockets you can hold in my opinion isn't a very big deal and I think that this nerf/buff is more of a buff.

4) Little nerfs towards to the piles of mats found on the ground or to the llama mats makes me think epic doesn't like building and that's good to new players but bad to experienced players. This has its pros and cons but I think this is more of a bad thing considering building is basically this game's only skill gap.",FortNiteBR

However, as someone who plays a lot of squads the recent changes to rocket launchers, grenade launchers, mini gun and C4s are slowly ruining the game for me. 

I’ve noticed that it’s getting a lot harder to win games unless you have explosives of your own. Going against a team with all of those and mini guns make me feel completely useless and that there’s no point in trying to fight them. With less players on your team it’s seems almost impossible to beat a team with explosives too.

I just hope I’m not the only one feeling this way and the rest of the community can show their voice so epic can make some changes that doesn’t involve 100 ways to counter building.

I had her ask him what his levels were, and he's level 70, battle pass tier 100, with 900 vbucks. My understanding was that the full 100 tiers of the pass would earn you enough vbucks to purchase the subsequent season's pass, but he's claiming he didn't earn enough points.

-So I came up with a concept for a new grenade
(anti camp) This grenade will be called the ""Rift grenade"". It will suck up all structures in a certain area and will NOT deal any damage to players. Also there will be a small delay for building in that area. 

(KILLFEED)

Instead of the text, add Weapon Outlines, These outlines will be in the shape and the colour of the gun/item you killed with, Or get killed by. for example: You killed someone with an Green AR, then then it is 

Player583 "" Green AR Weapon Outline"" Player385

IMO this will look much cleaner, and more 'premium'

(BATTLEBUS ANIMATION)

Before the match starts, have a short little animation (Like the Switch Trailer) like jumping out of the BattleBus, Would be Epic!

Explosives are like mini nukes, sub machine/tommy guns are devastating for every situation, mini gun shoots down structures like they're made from cardboard (even from 200m), and most importantly, the double pump is no where close to how viable it once was.

I personally feel that the current meta is straight up annoying and unhealthy for it's longevity. I thought taking a few days off this game would help, but no. The way the game is played now makes it almost unbearable to play after a couple hours. ""Just build lol"" doesn't really work when you got an enemy team just spamming automatic guns/rockets trying to get their first kill. It bothers the shit out of me when having to sit still or camp, even for 5 seconds. But that's what the game is promoting.

These recent changes were to make the game more balanced, not flip whats's overpowered and what's not. pumps and tacs are the red-headed step child out of all the weapons now. I still love the heavy and will pick it up every time, Especially two, but why pick up even a blue pump when you can just melt someone in 1 second with a tac sub or tommy gun.

I understand it's just a beta and Epic is always making changes. But for real lets make a U-turn on the recent changes, I shouldn't drop a gold scar for a blue suppressed machine gun just because of bloom..",FortNiteBR

Just want to start off with to get this to attention that I’m not looking for anything from this apart from a little more communication and awareness for others going into the same situation that I’ve been through. 

So around the middle of may this year there was a fortnite tournament that was available for people to join at a UK retailer called GAME. 

So a good friend of mine hit me up and we thought sure why not. We got this. 

The event was meant to last for a week and the prize pool was around ~£30 for the winners

The terms were;

3 matches with a friend in a duo only mode. 

(You could buy more entries to get a better placement)

luckily we never needed that, and we spent about £20 on entry and food/drinks while we were there. 

We finished 2nd place two times and 5th with total kills at ~21 (majority of kills were from friend) and since we were the first to participate we earned first place and stayed there. 

Here’s where things go wrong, we checked every couple of days to see if we were still first. Got back a “Yup, extending time to get more people to participate”

Fair enough, can imagine word of mouth might spread around and get more people to join which could lead to more competitions in the future. 

A month passes and one of the clerks pretty much goes “oh it’s done, you won but we can’t do anything.”

I was shocked at this point and a little bit salty 

Spoke to the manager and got told that epic had sponsored game to do the competition and pulled the prize pool from all shops that participated and they couldn’t do anything. 

Upon leaving I get a kick in the teeth when he says I should play the overwatch comp games in store they have since blizz just sent a huge loot box filled with goodies. 

So I’m a little stuck. I don’t know what to do now. 

Has anyone else participated in GAME for the same competition? 

This was located in Milton Keynes UK

As I said in the beginning, it was a bad move of epic to pull the prize like that when they’ve literally just taken peoples money with no return apart from an experience that I could have had over discord in my bedroom. 

I have receipt proof, a custom POS they had in window. But that’s all apart from my word. 


TLDR;

Joined fortnite competition, won, epic pulled prize pool, feelsbad.

I did pay for the battle pass and I think this would be a great way to strike a compromise with being consumer and company friendly and keeping the player continuously engaged. I know i would have even more drive to play even more next season to finally earn that level.

There’s also the theory of time travel being included in some way. If you combine all of these theories as well as some of Season 4’s costumes, you get an idea that the new map could be based around the Golden Age of Hollywood, when westerns, detectives, and adaptations of various mythologies dominated silver screens across the world. The fact that Durrr Burger showed up in California, where Hollywood actually is, lends itself to this theory as well, along with the Noir costumes, the Drum Gun, Moisty Mire’s film sets and the cameras appearing across the map, and the theme of Season 4 itself, Superheroes, which currently dominate our film industry.

If anything, I find that the idea of the mask relating to Egyptian or Japanese mythology supports this theory as well, as samurai films were regularly popular and considered a key aspect of the Golden Age of Hollywood (or international cinema in this case), and Egypt was a prominent location in biblical-adaptation films of the time (Lawrence of Arabia, The Ten Commandments).

But most notably, the ""Worlds Collide"" title is a reference to a 1951 film titled ""When Worlds Collide,"" whose IMDb description reads ""As a new star and planet hurtle toward a doomed Earth, a small group of survivalists frantically work to complete the rocket which will take them to their new home.""

Today I had the time to play a few rounds and I just realized that the core gameplay mechanic - the gunplay - is still completely broken due to the bloom system.

Gunfights really just come down to luck if both players are equally skilled. Just now I had an engagement where I crouched, ADS and fired my SCAR at an enemy at close to medium distance. My aiming was spot on, still suddenly I started to ""miss"" most of my shots due to random bloom and I lost the firefight.

This was eye opening after a few weeks of abstinence. The core gameplay is still utterly flawed for a competitive game, but it doesn't seem like Epic is making any moves to fix it.

All automatic weapons and shotguns are just luck cannons. Ofc, if your aim is considerable better than that of your opponent you are still likely to win. But at equal or close skill range, it's completely down to luck. Both players can get a similar shotgun shot, one might do twice the dmg due to shotgun pattern rng.

I'm just taken aback right now. Maybe I needed some distance to see how crazy this all is, but it actually kills the fun. I know a lot of my equal skill engagements come down to luck, nothing more.

I don't know if I will play a lot of Fortnite anymore. I know, all the new stuff can kinda ""blind"" you, but the core game is bad. That is the sad truth.

And pls don't freak out if you don't agree with me, maybe all you need is some time off to see the flaws.

I want a system based on recoil and determined patterns, not luck.

I am really grateful to epic for adding something that I could obtain while some others have not. However, with that in mind, I believe that the way of obtaining said skins could be better.

To obtain the omega lights, you need a very hefty amount of xp. Although this is definitely obtainable(I have), I think it could be implemented better.

Here are a few suggestions I thought of that could improve potential skill based skins in season 5:

1. Rework the xp system. By this I do not mean make it less xp required. I feel that you should definitely get more xp per kill, or by doing other tasks. The current system promotes camping as survival time and placement have the largest impact.

2. Have an entirely separate skin as the reward. I feel the reason why there are so many people complaining about not having the omega lights is because the skin generally doesn’t look well without the lights. Some may have other opinions but a completely separate skin reward for achieving level 80 would definitely cause less people to complain.

3. Change the way you earn said skin(s) by implementing difficult long-term challenges. For example, to unlock the skin you would need to have 1k kills, 500 matches played, and 50 wins or something along those lines. 


What do you guys think on the matter? Do you agree/disagree with any of my suggestions?",FortNiteBR

Yea i get it, the XP system is flawed. Doesn’t mean that omega wasn’t meant to be something that’s HARD to get. 

So many people complain that there aren’t long term challenges then when there is one, everyone complains it’s too much of a grind. Make up your mind?

One more thing: to the people that have the lights, In a couple seasons from now you’re going to have one of the rarest most sought after skins IN THE GAME. The new S1 Halloween skins. So stop complaining because in the long run, you’re going to be incredibly happy you grinded.",FortNiteBR

-my aim is pretty terrible with basically every weapon, I can't use a AR of any kind to shoot someone far away from me, mostly because I play with a bad mouse and mousepad (working on buying a better one). I rely heavily on shotguns, even though my aim is really bad even with them, I just can't land enough shots to kill someone before they kill me.

I tried for the past month straight to get to level 80, but I just can't make it in time. **So here's my idea:** The basic lighting (like advertised where all the skins line up) is given to players who reached level 65, or maybe even level 70. The other colors are still only for those who've made it to level 80. This way if you've made it to tier 100 you can still look cool, but if you've made it to level 80 you've got those extra bragging rights. A lot of my friends have made it to tier 100 but none have actually made it all the way to level 80, and honestly, the Omega skin without all the lighting just isn't as cool as it could be to us, and as much as I hate to say it, I won't be using it as much as I'd wanted to.

So I recently stumbled onto a small game called Fortnite when it came onto the Nintendo Switch and I found it pretty fun. I went ahead and bought the battle pass(BP) since I enjoy having clear objectives to play towards and things to earn. Now I've maxed the battle pass and reached level 55; however, I'm growing a bit annoyed with the game atm. With only a few days left to fully max out the Carbide and Omega skins I'm quite perturbed I won't be able to earn the full costumes. I really enjoy the game, but due to work and responsibilities I can only play for an hour or two every other day or so. The fact that my progress will be cut off in the next few days (albeit for another cool season of costumes hopefully!) isn't sitting well with me so I'd like to propose a solution!

Why not allow people who purchase a BP continue to earn progress towards its rewards even after the season ends? Now I know this is probably an unpopular opinion, but I feel like if you pay for something like this in a game, the developers shouldn't take away what you paid for (which is essentially the ability to earn costumes). I'm sure there's many options the developers could take to make this work. Maybe just restrict it to the evolving costumes like Omega that depend on your personal season level rather than the BP level? Maybe allow you to still fully upgrade the pass, but if you earn every reward before the season ends you get something really nice? I'm not sure what the best option would be or even if it should be fixed. All I do know is that I really enjoy this game, but I feel the developers undervalue me as a player compared to the person who can play more frequently and with other battle pass members. I'm not asking to make the BP easier to complete for casual players, I just want to be given the time I need to complete it.

Yes, I've read the other posts similar to mine, and I understand they developed this as a badge of honor for those who are ""truly dedicated"" and ""hardcore"". But who's more dedicated? The person with excessive free time who spends it all playing only this game or the person with limited free time who chooses to spend it playing only this game? This post is intended to be a both a suggestion and a discussion, so please let me know what you think about my idea (what works, what doesn't, what could be better). Also, I'm pretty new to Reddit so if I posted this in the wrong way somehow please forgive and let me know how I can do it correctly next time. *Thanks for reading!*",FortNiteBR

I bought the S4 battle pass on day 1. I play 1-3 hours per week, usually just long enough to get my weeklies done. I just now hit tier 100 and got Omega. EPIC made the battle pass rewards very achievable if someone like me can reach tier 100, and I appreciate that a lot.

I'm level 54, and I plan on playing enough to hit 55 and get Omega's helmet.  Looks like Carbide lights are out of the question, but IMHO there really should be rewards that are out of reach for some players.

And please don’t say that they are so good that they make everyone look like noobs because I’ve heard that argument before and you can tell who is a good player and who isn’t even if they get outplayed by the streamer.

As many of you now know, a meteorite landed in Estherville in 1879 (the largest meteorite in North America). A page on Estherville's website said the largest chunk landed on Lee Farms, which is located very close to Estherville in what is now Armstrong, Iowa.

Well, it looks like the location of the IRL Durr Burger represents Greasy Grove on a map, and Estherville represents where the in-game meteorite landed in Dusty Divot. I found the straight shot distance between the IRL Durr Burger and Armstrong, Iowa is roughly 1,365 miles. The distance between Greasy Grove and Dusty Divot is roughly 1,050 meters. The distance between Dusty Divot (Estherville) and Tomato Town (Location X) is 500m. That means Tomato Town is roughly half the distance away from Divot as Greasy is.

That means Tomato Head  (Location X) should be roughly 700 miles NE of Estherville to mirror the direction and distance on the Fortnite map. Guess what city is 700 miles NE of Estherville...

Armstrong, Ontario, Canada! Armstrong is also the name of the town the meteorite landed in IRL in Iowa in 1879. Coincidence? I think not!

Take a look at my maps that I've included and let me know your thoughts in the comments. 

To all of our Armstrong, ON, Canada homies: Get looking!

As this sub can be quite hostile with a lot of bragging, I wanted to tell the side of a new player, a below average player, who enjoys the game a lot.

Tl;dr: I don't get a lot of kills, I lose most build fights and I occasionally camp to see what my next plan is. I am not skilled enough to land at populated areas so I land a places where I face 2 or 3 others. If I get out of there, I am looted up and have a good chance to reach top 10 with 2-3 kills and go from there. I have fun doing this.

So here we are, a bad fortnite player in a sub where a lot of people act like a god and people who don't get a lot of kills or build insane structures are looked down upon. 

I started playing at the end of season 3. I got killed a lot. I adjusted my game, landed at places nobody goes, got a lot of loot and got killed by a good player who found me. Then I landed at populated places to learn to win fights. I dropped tilted, pleasant, salty, retail, whatever was first on the battle bus route. It worked. I still got killed a lot, but I started winning more battles.

Now I take the in-between route. Landing at places like haunted moisty or wailing if it is at the beginning of the battle bus route. It gives me a clean overview over the location and a good chance I am there with 2 or 3 other players of around my skill level.

I still lose a lot of battles in houses (no idea why), but I win a good bunch of battles in areas like haunted. 

When I survive the beginning, I get into the next circle and if I don't find anyone, I might camp for a minute. I do this for the following reasons:
- I want to see where the next circle will be
- I want to check if there will be a fight near me
- I actually have no clue what to do next

I dont avoid battles, but I might back off from a battle. An example: If I land at that mountain with the house on it south west of Salty and kill 2 people, I will not have full health. If I have decent loot and know a 3rd guy is in the house, I back away. Reasons: I am at a disadvantage health-wise and I cannot fight in houses for some reason (mentioned before). So why should I push? I go to the surrounding houses and hope to find shields or healing.

If I am in a build fight, I might end up boxing myself in. Why? Because I fuck up my building and build myself in, getting in a real disadvantage or actually accidentally drop to the ground. I panic and box myself in to get cover from the shots. The result is that I die anyway or I am lucky and a 3rd guy joins the fight. Then I have time to get out of the sticky situation.

I generally only push if I am at an advantage. I dont push bases, because I dont know how and I get killed almost every time. I still have to learn this, but that will come when my building improves. Another reason to not push: I love sniping. A snipe kill is much more rewarding to me

Why am I telling this?
A lot of people get called out on this sub, but dont be too harsh. A lot of us are trying, but still learning. Seeing someone take shelter doesnt necessarily mean he is a camper. He could be a below average guy with 3 kills, adrenaline and insecurity running through his body. Eventually, we will learn how to push people. Until then, we might be easy kills for you. We accept that, as long as you dont belittle us. ",FortNiteBR

So the other day I saw the new Oblivion skin, which is basically the female version of the Omega skin you get for reaching tier 100 of the battle pass. I got to say, I was both elated and a bit bummed by this. 

To preface this, I'm a girl and I enjoy playing with the girl skins. I've been using the astronaut woman with her rad aviators since I got her in season 3 (when I first started playing). I did all my tiers season 3, but was a little disheartened to complete season 4 upon seeing another male skin (which I realize this is a male dominated game being a shooter and all, so understandable) as the tier 100 reward. 

On the one hand, Oblivion is a great looking skin. On the other, I was bummed because if you're like me and enjoy playing as a girl, you have to pay while the male version of the skin is ""free"". You gotta pay for a battle pass I know, but it's significantly cheaper than the 2,000 v-bucks it costs for Oblivion (and if you started playing in an earlier season, they give you enough v-bucks that it basically becomes free after your initial purchase.) 

I think we should be able to choose the gender of our tier 100 skin. I don't feel like this would be a big problem since Epic generally has male &amp; female versions of skins; it would just give people who enjoy playing as a female more incentive to reach tier 100. Then maybe both skins could be sold so people who collect skins could buy the one they didn't pick for their reward. 

Obviously, it'd be awesome if we could just have both a male and female version as the tier 100 reward and not have to choose, but I understand Epic Games is a business, and I don't want to be greedy.",FortNiteBR

These skins are some of the most coveted and wanted in the game and due to how the system worked in the past many did not purchase. Because these skins were in the shop at one point, we propose that these are brought back to the shop out of season, enabling players to purchase these one last time. 

This would significantly reduce the amount of aftermarket accounts being traded and sold, which is against ToS. This would keep revenues within the Epic games ecosystem and further benefit the game along with its development.",FortNiteBR

Season 3 as the primary example, we received 4 separate backblings for the Battlepass (or the one free backbling) with all of them matching the various skins we received. In order, it went Astro (for the Moonwalker), Precision (for the Elite Agent) , Rust Bucket (for the Rust Lord) and Dark Matter (for Dark Voyager). This season we got the Goodie Bag (for Zoey) and the Advanced Forces (for Battlehawk) and that was it; no backbling to match the Carbide or Omega (arguably the two main skins everyone had purchased the pass for) unless you purchased the just released Female Omega skin.

The trails we received were practically copied; they felt derivative mainly of the fire trail from Season 3 and the shooting star was only meh; it blocks too much of the screen (just like the Paint trail).

Pickaxes galore! We got three pickaxes, atleast (from memory) the Candy Pick, the Carbide and then the Omega.. though two of them were pure copy-pastes with differing colours and the other was just plain bad.

Going backwards, into Season 3, the teasers for the season were intense and many; we had the large meteor right at the top of the sky, with practically everyone giving their two cents about how the audio patterns gave certain things and then making memes from them and I'll never forget the countless times I've had the shit scared out of me from a meteor landing. The rocket taking off was cool, but there were those handful of people ruining it for everyone, which sucked. 

The whole AGR kerfuffle is too overdone honestly; keep it ingame. This game has already spread to so many aspects of real life in the sense that it is literally everywhere and everyone plays it, it doesn't need to have IRL teasers - I'm sorry.

The worst part of Season 4, you ask?

-Less ""throwable"" emotes in the Battle Pass, they seem like they're just fillers

-More loading screens in the Battle Pass

-Bring back the factories!

-More lobby backgrounds (perhaps make them unlockable?) 

-If the theme is time travel, why not have a throwback LTM with the Season 1 Map?

-Turn down/get rid of the music at the Disco Factory

-Better T100 Rewards (Omega was great but if it came with the BackBling / Glider it'd be cool)

-More skins that require grinding or winning (skins that show your skill)

-Vault the bush

-Better incentives to win (Victory Shop or something)

-Ability to spectate your friends games in lobby while you wait for them to finish

-More diverse challenges (aka no more Chest Challenges)

-Address Deagle Dropoff

-A setting that allows you to play the old music

-Be able to see inventory/mats while spectating (they mentioned wanting to add this a while back but haven't yet).

The rocket launched, and cracked a huge rift in the fortnite world as it did, this rift did not pass through time, and people suggest, but rather just dimensions, into our dimensions, which is why, when the durr burger left the fortnite world, it appeared in the real world. 


The number the agent gave us only made a sound like an anomaly and nothing else, I think that this means that somewhere in this world, there was an anomaly. Today a lama pops up in a phone booth.

**PUBG is trying to fall a lawsuit against Fortnite.**
*What players **THINK** .*
Fortnite didnt copy pubg because theres no buildin)on PUBG. (Thats true.)
What is the **TRUTH:**
pubg has a chance of winning against Foetnite in the lawsuit. 
&gt;How come?&lt;

Well, PUBG is a south korean company and they beleive in a different system which is more peaceful. This means that it doesnt matter if they didnt copy it completely. As long as it **includes** the same name and the same things on the game, **They can possible win the lawsuit.**
Personally, I think pubg is stupid out of honesty Because, Fortnite Isnt the same and I also think the whole ""peaceful"" copyright system is stupid.

I had about 1000 solo matches played during on Friday with a 5% win rate. I typically play very aggressive, but in order to make it to 80 before the weekend ended, I had to drop loot lake every single game all weekend long and take control of the house, go to the cave underneath the house, and hide in the rafters. Meanwhile I'd set a timer telling me when the first or second circle closed (depending on whether or not I was on the edge of the first zone), then try to sneak around until I was top 2 or 3 so I could get maximum xp and I hated every single minute of camping. I really did nothing productive the whole weekend aside from Saturday because the XP system is such a pile of garbage. I don't even have a wife or kids and I barely got it done. I'm burnt out on the game for a while because the grind was so tedious.

Before I could build up, snipe, or do AR shots or something, or win some shotgun duels. But now, everyone has the reaction time to build when they're shot and ramp rush me. Which is neat, they are knowledgeable players. But that's where it all goes wrong. They always manage to get the upper hand on me in this situation. Either they outbuild me and manage to navigate the structure to kill me, or they are able to get down to the ground and kill me there if I drop down too. I struggle facing one player at a time, and with all of these weapons in the game I don't know how to handle it. 

At the beginning of the season I could feel somewhat confident at saying I'm above average (with a few squad wins under my belt and a solo win) cause I felt I had good building skills and could win some shotgun duels. But now I seem to be thoroughly destroyed by any other player I come across, and it makes it harder with squads when I wanna have some fun with friends who don't play as much as me but I just get creamed. I haven't really had time to practice in the playground this weekend and it's being taken down at the start of the season so now I feel like I'm losing even more progress.

For the record this is the only shooter I have ever really played. I played a few matches of Halo on a cousin's Xbox, I've played through the half life series last year, but I've never *actually* had this level of play before, so it makes it frustrating that I struggle to keep up.",FortNiteBR

I believe that with this new teaser and season 5 being only 3 days away, that it tells us that there is going to be a new map for fortnite, one that is situated in an Egyptian setting, with both pyramids and a desert setting.

What leads me to believe this is that i think the cat-like character is a homage to egyptian hieroglyphics, and with all the time cracks appearing in the map, i think this is transporting some of the segments from the current map, to this new old egyptian map to come, for instance the mr tomato head and the Durr burger  have both gone missing. I think that these will be scattered in the new map, maybe even half buried in sand as a reference to the older map.

But while the production team was making a movie about superheroes, elsewhere on the island there is a very real super-villain lair with a very real rocket ready to launch inside of it. The Visitor breaks out of his meteor and sneaks into said villain lair and launches the rocket, which has now lead to our Season 5 shattered sky and time rifts and such.

So because of this weird contrast between movie and real, do we have any way of knowing which loading screens and skin teasers represent movie shots and which ones represent real events?

What's everyone's ideal, 5-slot loadout, and list them in order of the slots you carry them in too!  Mine is 1) gold scar, 2) gold heavy shotgun, 3) blue drum gun, 4) gold minigun, and 5) mini shields.  People sleep on the minigun, it's better than any explosive weapon out there.",FortNiteBR

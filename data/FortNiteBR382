Have you noticed it’s always the John Wicks and battle hounds with black knight back bling that hit you from miles away multiple times in a row? Not once has a default skin done this.

They also seem to do more damage and take less damage as-well. If it’s a default skin I’m shooting they get ended in a couple shots but when it’s one of the 2,000 Vbuck skins they take 9 damage and they 2 shot me.

I’ve only ever bought the battle pass so I’ve not spent a lot compared to others. There are times where I stand in front of an enemy shooting at the same body part with the same gun with the only difference being the skin.

It is because of the degree of randomness that these games have. Loot is random and chests aren't always in the same spot which make it difficult to have a fair even playing field.

Anyways I have an idea on how Fortnite can become an eSport, here it is:

#1: LOADOUTS
Add loadouts to the game where you can get a grey rarity weapon of a selected class. You would also be able to pick a material to have (like 100 wood, or 70 brick, or 50 steel, or 30 of each idk). Then the loadout also comes with 5 bandages or whatever this will take time to tweak im sure but what this does is that it created a more even playing field from the start and allows people to strategize at the start of the game.

#2 CIRCLE PLACEMENT
Similar to how the buss route is shown at the start of the game they should show the first big circle on the map. This way teams can also strategize on where to land and push in.

#3 RARE LOOT EVENTS
I think they should still keep the chests in the game but they should not be able to drop a gold scar or RPGs or Nade Launchers. This is something PUBG does right. You cant get an AWM in PUBG from the ground it has to be in a crate and this is random (this much randomness is okay I believe). So this leads to my actual suggestion:

~

Fortnite should make the Crates that drop from the sky be announced on MAP TO EVERYONE and make it more of an EVENT so that players can decide if they would like to go and push for the crate which maybe guarantees some sort of power weapon (this again can be random I feel since it is YOUR choice to try and go get it. This will create something that a lot of people will go to and try to protect for valuable weapons and would mesh well with the feel on BR.

~

And that is pretty much it, what do you guys all think? 

EDIT: I am not suggesting that these changes be done to the base game, this would essentially be the eSport or ""Ranked Mode"" so to speak.",FortNiteBR

Only gun you can effectively bunny hop like a mad man, impulse turn and shoot, one shot with little aim required, take out a whole squad without reloading. Even if you have to reload the tactical it literally takes like .1 seconds longer to shoot while reloading. And console players with a scuff?? They don’t even have to take thumb off aiming stick to jump, making it soo much easier for them. 

You either run a shotgun or get owned by one. I’ve done some experimenting and it’s far easier to run no AR then no shotgun. Silenced pistol is actually a very good replacement for mid range (does limit it a bit but it’s solid) 

Close range combat is where the heat gets turned up and you’re heart starts racing. What better way to quickly, easily and effectively end this then a shotgun? There isn’t. Sure you can use a pistol and win, but against an experienced player with a shotty it’s near impossible because how many shots you need to land, where they can typically end the fight in 2-3 if they don’t get the one shot. 

If you’re a shotgun fan (and I know you are, pfft) then tell me why you don’t think shotguns are op.

Personally, I believe this game would require far more skill if shotguns never existed. And don’t look at me like you aren’t running a shotgun praying for those one shot easy kills.

In my opinion the game is in a fairly good state right now. With the latest building changes most of my complaints and frustrations have been addressed. You guys are even adding things to the game I didn't even know I wanted, like the hunting rifle and loot llamas!

&amp;nbsp;

One thing that still gets me though is that I have a huge disadvantage when I push/peak left around a corner. The camera position sits behind my character's right shoulder which means I cannot see as much around corners as someone on the other side peaking around the right. **More importantly** my gun rests on my right shoulder or on my right hip, so if I peak around a corner on the left **at the same time** as someone peaks around on the right... by the time they can fire and hit me.. my shot will just hit the wall. 

&amp;nbsp;

##### I made some poorly drawn illustrations to help explain why this is an issue, and why shoulder swapping would give players the power to even out the playing field:

[AMAZING PICTURES - A STORY OF ME DYING AND WHY SHOULDER SWAPPING MIGHT HELP](https://imgur.com/a/MBGHG)

&amp;nbsp;

If we could hit a key to have our camera/gun position switch between the left and right shoulder of our character, I would feel more confident pushing up stairs or around doorways. *As a player I should not feel like I'm going to die just because I'm on the wrong side of a doorway.*

&amp;nbsp;

##### A couple concerns I'd like to address to guide discussion:

- Many of us are looking forward to the shooting test #2 LTM because we feel bloom is a greater problem, but by comparison shoulder swapping feels like low hanging fruit. SO please keep discussion relevant to shoulder swapping, bloom is a separate topic.

- I'm not sure how many buttons console players have left to work with. Please please please don't let this stop you from adding shoulder swapping to PC at the very least.

&amp;nbsp;

##### TLDR: 
You are at a huge disadvantage when you peak left around walls, and when you push up stairs: [Here are some illustrations which show why](https://imgur.com/a/MBGHG). If we could press a key to swap camera/gun position between shoulders this would give players the power to even the playing field

I couldn’t coordinate anything with my team. They went straight for tilted which is suicide while I farmed like 800 would and got three snipers. One of them died at tilted one was got killed one guy from another squad that I tried sniping from a distance. And the last guy was at the edge of the storm with two guys and of course I had to kill those two hiding in a fort before I revived him. So I did and the storm got him. All of my 7 kills are from my sniper and I should have more but I team claimed some of the knocked people. Anyways, my point is we need mic support because I cannot tell my team to get to higher ground with me or to not engage or not to commit suicide at tilted. Also the combat needs to be improved on with shottys and snipers. I’ve had countless issues aiming with the hunting rifle even though I’m aware of the bullet drop. So the guy I died from peaked. I was at a mid range the hit marker was on his body and he peaked long enough for the travel time to register. Except the shot didn’t register. Look, don’t take this as me complaining about fortnite and how pubg is better but there is a lot to be improved on and I’d love epic to know.",FortNiteBR

We started out as potatoes, learning the very basics of the game, losing most of our fights and scared to go outdoors at all. 

We stayed as potatoes for a long time, barely winning 1 or 2 games total in the first few months. Each win was just an awesome experience, it was a rush no other game gave us. We enjoyed getting better by adjusting our decision-making and fighting style after each loss, it was the difficulty of the win that kept us coming back for more.

Very gradually, we got better, we won more and more fights until recently, we're winning games every day. Even though we're NOT that good, we worked our way from potatoes to being able to build comfortably, rush up forts, or blow them down with explosives, we coordinate well and worked out our best loadouts. It's the climb that made it so much fun, it was a fresh of breath air compared to the skill-based match-making in Overwatch, where every win and loss didn't mean much, you're playing people who are at nearly the same exact level as you. 

Honestly I have no idea how skill-based match making will be like in Fortnite, but I'm happy with the way it is now. In a way you see yourself level up as you get better and finally climb that mountain to victory. If I think back, it would be pretty lame if as a potato, I got wins early on because all the other players in the game were also potatoes. The win just wouldn't be a win, and that's what makes Fortnite really worth it.",FortNiteBR

I am a strong advocate of gaming and have been a gamer since around age 4 so they already have a fight on their hands but I wondered if anyone else has had this issue &amp; knows the legality from a parental perspective?

This is why I think EPIC should add a duel mode, where 2 players que up into a small flat field and fight to the death.

-2 players

-Both players start with 100 health and 100 shields

-Both players start with a gray assault rifle, a gray pump (or green tactical), a blue bolt action sniper, ten mini shields, and three med kits.

-Both players have a lot of ammo (no idea what amount would be balanced)

-They both start with 999 wood, 999 brick, and 500 metal

These rules are meant for the fight to be as fun, and intense as possible, which I'm pretty sure is what a lot of players are looking for, as it is very rare to get crazy build fights in solos (in my experience at least)

People that are struggling to get their first solo win can also use this mode to practice against other people so they are better prepared for 1v1 situations, and other players can just que in with friends to find out who's actually better at the game.

I am a HUGE fan of Epic Games' 3rd person MOBA Paragon. It is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing. There were some great times and memories made on that game, from the salt, to the laughs, and regardless I've always enjoyed it. I started playing relatively early, about a month after the open beta had launched and since then I just fell in love. I stuck with the game for 2 years and I have accumulated over 2 months worth of play time (It'd be more if I hadn't had school and work).

Unfortunately the game is shutting down on April 26th, and when I heard this, i'm not gonna lie, I was, and still am heartbroken. I've never felt such an enormous emotional attachment to a game like that before, I was just so consumed by the gameplay and lore, it was unbelievable; and to hear that the game would just shut down definitely took a toll on me.

Rather than feeling resentful towards EPIC, I feel empathy. I know that they didn't want the game to fail either, what company would want to sabotage their selves like that? I can only imagine the monumental disappointment from all the developers when they heard the news.

Anyway, my request is this: Can we please receive something in memory of Paragon on Fortnite? Maybe a Twinblast or Serath skin? Or even the Paragon icon as an emote?

I would really hate for Paragon to just vanish into nothingness, it'd be a shame for such a masterpiece. Please EPIC, it would really mean a lot to me. I would appreciate it if you guys could help this post get some attention it'd mean the world to me. Sorry this was so long, I'm just really passionate about this. 

Thanks in advance!

If you disagree I hope you feel encouraged to discuss with me why you believe differently. Seeing as the front page is covered in meme/epicplz/video posts. I was hoping to bring some true discussion to this amazing subreddit.

Anyways,


As of now there are a couple of items that have been vaulted.

(Goodbye smoke my old friend)

 There are also items that I would say were re-introduced. E.g. the jump pad


There is definitely items that I believe will be seeing the dreaded void if they aren't changed fundamentally or adjusted to be more attractive to be held for end game

So here it is


1)boogie bomb

Unless an actual grenade slot is added I don't see this item staying for the long haul. Nerfs to the duration and an addition of breaking the dance 'status effect' on dmg recieved leaves this item to feel like a wasted slot for me.


2) The mini-gun

Woefully inaccurate gunfire  leaves the gun to just induce more frustration that satisfaction when using. I agree that its main use is for bunker busting but taking into coinsideration 5 slots makes this choice rather unattractive. Another downside is that unless you have managed to rake In light ammo,  this gun will bleed your reserves dry within seconds.


3) the musket/deagle

Now this comes from my opinion as both a player on pc and ps4. The gun has a slow fire rate, A high bloom crosshair, and dmg that cannot take down a  built wooden wall(no matter what the trailer might show) . That makes the gun a pass for me.


4) the Valentine's day cross bow 

This weapon leaves me confused. It feels like I see this more often than  snipers but the fact that it feel like the rof is the same makes this gun an awkward  substitute for a ranged weapon without taking into account the hideous drop it has. It's a poor man's scoped AR.


5) the slurp juice

With its consume time, It's low payout of 25 hp/shield at a timed interval. It Makes this item just feel underpowered. Why would anyone hold this and not consume on the spot. Half the time it's only used for the 25 shield. Now for those who say it's for storm use. That is incorrect. The Storm ignores shield.  So after the first circle this item becomes obsolete to hold on to for longer than when you find it.


6) the campfire

While I love the idea behind this and how it supports a team mentality. The area of effect is incredibly short. Also the verticality is non existent. As fortnite encourages building. In the middle of a team fight walls and ramps can be put up in a frenzy. My other gripe is this game doesn't encourage stationary camping as you have a timer to fight against and the heals are small for the large time you have to sit to reap the rewards. With low times to kill, health over time items will be lackluster.


7) the Bush

I love this item but the fact that it obscures your vision makes this an item that is only used for a comedic relief. I also wish dmg would not break the disguise.  I believe only a down or kill should remove it.


8) the semi automatic sniper

While it's fun to be able to take constant pot shots at an enemy. You can see that the meta gravitates toward the one shot bolt action. I believe it's because staying scoped and stationary leaves you very vulnerable. This games pace  is faster which also lends to the fact that slow technical items are very cumbersome to use and break up the constant motion the main gameplay promotes. (Running, building  and fast paced skirmishes)

I hoped I didn't rustle to many jimmies and make anyone angry that I have gripes with items in this amazingly fun game.

I love it and want to know how everyone else feels.

Also sorry for typos, writing long posts on mobile sucks.

Lastly, quick shout out to epic. The mouse  and keyboard input for ps4 doesn't have a cursor. It's hard to try and mess with my inventory or navigate menus on console while I have my PC periphels plugged in.",FortNiteBR

However, how come it's been almost a **MONTH** since the Rainbow Smash has been released, and it's still not featured in the Item Shop? I mean, clearly Epic doesn't mind placing Epic pickaxes as daily items (just like today's Death Valley pickaxe), so why do they got to skip the Rainbow Smash for so long? Why some skins of the same rarity make appearances multiple times while others take forever to show up?

Also, if anything, shouldn't they rotate the Rainbow Smash in *before* releasing new skins and pickaxes, to lure you to buy it before you get a chance to see the new ones? Seeing how clearly some would prioritize the new ones and thus choose to skip an older skin they had been planning to grab, just because it came after a new skin that they find more appealing had been released prior to older one they had been waiting on? If Epic first rotates in older skins and then new ones, some people might not be able to resist and decide to grab the new ones as well, seeing how they find them more appealing.

This whole concept just makes no sense to me, and it's not like I'm making a thread about it every day; I've been patiently waiting, but hell, it's been nearly a month.

The game is incredibly fun and all, but i believe I'm doing something (?) teeeerribly wrong at this game. I started playing about a month ago and so far played 150 games. Most of those games everything is fine until I run into someone - I just lose e v e r y gunfight, even if i have a ridiculous advantage. here's an example:
1. i'm looting at fatal fields and hear somebody running by, so i crouch and listen to the footsteps. the guy runs past me with his back to me so i start shooting at him, hit every shot, he turns around, i'm dead after half a second (100 health 100 shield)
2. I get killed by pistols and ARs from ridiculous ranges where i'm never ever able to hit anything, no matter if my crosshair is always in the right spot - random bullet deviation seems to hate me kinda while i see a lot of other players just getting kill after kill without even trying hard on those higher ranges

am I getting something terribly wrong about how this game or the gun mechanics or whatever work? my ping is always around 30ms, never higher than 50ms during games, so I believe lag isn't an excuse. I really like the game, but it's terribly frustrating that I can't seem to figure out how to actually win, it's at a point where i just drop into nowhere because i'm so afraid of running into anyone

So, my friend is currently offering relatively cheap Fortnite coaching for all levels of players. He is currently one of the top globally ranked players with a 10 K/D in solos, and over 500 wins across all accounts, as well as being on a highly ranked competitive team.
His stats: https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/spongebabetwitch
His website: http://www.fortnitecoaching.com

He aims to provide the highest quality of coaching at a fair price, and most importantly, provide an enjoyable experience for both new and more experienced players.

It would really mean a lot to him if this were to work out, as he's had a lot of bad luck lately with certain ventures and is struggling to stay afloat financially, and he can't easily find a 9-5 Office or Labour type job because of medical issues.

Thanks very much for reading, have a great day everyone!",FortNiteBR

But since season 3 has started, I have struggled in every match. It's almost comical at this point.  
  
Are the players on console just getting better overall? I used to out build and out gun most people, and when I was out gunned I never had that wtf feeling...  
  
I'm not really upset about it, it's just this feeling I have. Want to see if other people are having a similar issue/feeling.

Yes it's good at destroying bases, but I feel like the stupid spread means half the shots miss anyway. It has its benefits, but by comparison to every other gun that comes out of the drop (bar the Auto Sniper) is significantly better than it. If you remove the Scoped AR from drops, surely remove this too? Besides this, it could just use a buff in itself imo, particularly in the spread side of things. By late game when it's most effective, most of the time you'll have a splode or profuse AR ammo. This is also around the time you'll usually go for Supply Drops.

This is a genuine suggestion for the game devs who might come across this post.

I'm not by any means a good player, obviously. I'm getting older (32, not OLD but older for twitch-based shooters, etc), I don't have the time to devote or the reaction time I used to have. I **want** to enjoy this game, it looks awesome. I however can not enjoy the game when I'm being insta-killed by the first or second player I encounter each time I queue up.  I've attempted to play 10-15 battles and each time is the exact same. I will land, loot for 2-10 minutes, encounter the first player I see and end up right back in my lobby. This is not fun, I can't even learn the basics of the game without being killed instantly.

I'm not here looking for pity. I just wish the devs would implement something to help out the new/bad players such as myself. I'm not sure how this would even work but there has to be something they can try. I'm fairly confident I'm not the only player who wants to play but struggles. 

Well that's my suggestion, I'm sure it won't amount to anything but wanted to share my opinion. I'm glad so many other players are enjoying the game, I wish I could too.

Higher editions will give you more bang for your buck, but don’t directly contribute to your vbucks generation.


Getting schematics and upgrading your collection book to 26 gives you 500 vbucks. After that it won’t be worth upgrading the collection book for vbucks purposes. ( Next big vbucks reward at lvl 86 or something)


After finishing your first storm shield defense, you will unlock daily quests that reward  for 50 vbucks and 100 daily coins. Each completed SSD ( storm shield defense) gives you 100 vbucks and a skill point. You can hold up to 3 daily quests and abandon one daily quest to get a different one if you want.



There are challenges you can keep track of in the quest hub that show you what rewards it gives. I think I had a “toxic treasures” challenge that told me to keep killing mimics (type of rare husk in the form of a rare chest), giving me 30 vbucks per challenge. You can complete this challenge up to 10 times for 300 vbucks. The challenges after completeing a challenge it tells you to kill more of it until you reach the tenth challenge.


There are higher level missions that reward vbucks as well, but are not common and give around 30. I’d say just focus on the main quest line to get your vbucks if all you’re going to do is farm vbucks for the sake of BR.


**Now that I have your attention, don’t AFK and make your team carry you during missions. It’s really rude and takes away the joy from those in your group that are trying to complete the mission.

Please think very carefully before you start to cater the vocal minority.,"This might be an unpopular opinion but I've seen a lot of threads about the removal of Tilted Towers and I do not agree at all.

There is very little argumentation *for* the removal of tilted towers. If it's not tilted, it will be retail row, or pleasant park. In the end there is no winning and everybody wants the game to be played as *they* (the players) feel like it should be played. In the end this can be a very big setback for the game and for a lot of loyal players.

Just because a tread gets a few thousand upvoted, does not mean that this is what the players want, or at least what the *majority* wants.

If you really want an honest opinion from the millions of players, an in-game poll would be needed.

I, for one, are against the removal of Tilted Towers. 

I'm also ready for downvotes because I don't share the same opinion, allthough I find it very weak to downvote someone for this reason.",FortNiteBR

I have a sensitivity on Fortnite that I am quite happy with. I use Aim Hero to practice my aim pre game. But Aim hero has settings between Paladins, Overwatch and CS GO. I have no recent experience with any of these games and don't know their sensitivities for shit.

Is there any way that I can figure out what sensitivity on my Fortnite game would translate to that on Aim Hero?

From some calculations that others have done, I am getting to about 42 in game for Aim Hero but that is ridiculously high and not possible in game.

My Fortnite sens is .14 in game, 400 DPI.

In Aim Hero I have kept the sensitivity settings for now as Overwatch, don't know the difference if I change anything on it.

Thanks for any and all of your help!",FortNiteBR

My poor nephew who is 12 is not allowed to play Fortnite and neither does he have a console at home.  Some background information. My nephew who is 12 doesn't understand why he isn't allowed to play FN.  First and formost he is a smart kid. He is a straight A student. Plays sports in the local clubs and also plays piano.  He is also the oldest.  With Mobile FN being available I thought about sending my neph and invite to play.  

My sister his Mother is anti video games, and especially anti shooter game.  The poor kid has no reward I told her. Recently hes been acting out.  He apprently dropped an F Bomb ""Fuck You"" to his dad the coach of the team during a public scrim. She was thinking of a punishment.  I said take away whatever he loves. (ipad, whatever it maybe). But honestly what does he have at this point?  He knows hes missing out. What scares me the most for him is the possibility of kids exiling him for being weird for not playing FN.

Then is comes down to this. He claims everyone is playing FN.  Even the girls!  I cant help but feel hes being left out.  And now at this point the other kids wont even want to play with him since hes a noob.  I know this will backlash eventually come back on my sister for it already is.  He will continue to rebel in whatever way he can.  I cant imagine how frustrating this is for him.  His parents are both lawyers so im sure he doesn't understand why he cant play FN like the rest of his classmates.  Not even as a Reward for doing so well in school and activities. :(

I have been grinding a alternate account for him so when he does eventually get to play ill have something for him at least an account with some season skins.  

FN is a kids game. NO blood no GORE.  When you shot somone all you see is numbers of damage afflicted.  

Maybe if this gets enough comments and upvotes ill send this over for her to read, but until then I feel so bad for my neph. Hes a great kid who doesnt deserve this kind of treatment. A 30min - 1 hour or so a day if he finishes hes daily workload school / chores? Like seriously WTF!!!

IMO, the sky's the limit.","First, I will say I am not defending Epic or any game company. I just want to elaborate my perspective on in-game purchases in FNBR. I have a slight problem with pay2win scenarios, as in the PvE version of the same title or a Clash of Clans/Candy Crush pay for time model, where microtransactions affect in game power. That is another topic in iteself. 

So, what are we talking about here? Cosmetic-only items. Digital doll clothes. I equate this to real life Barbie dolls or GI Joe action figures, for which Mattel or Hasbro may make accessories. We are talking about fashion accessories for toys. These have no impact on the game itself. You can play it in its entirety for free. 

What I see most people who complain about these prices say: ""These prices are unreasonable, but these skins are sweet. If they were like $5.00/$2.00 instead of $20.00 I would probably buy them."" So, what makes this any more reasonable? Do we get to set the prices for how much any consumer product we want should cost? What if I were to say to Budweiser, ""Look, I think your beer is worth about a nickel per bottle. You should change prices or you are exploiting/price gouging people who choose to go to any restaurant where your beer is on the menu."" Because, as with cosmetics, beer is optional, so you don't have to buy it at all. You can still have a nice [chicken?] dinner without it. 

Another argument is that micro-transactions (if you can call $20 purchases ""micro"") take advantage of people with gambling* problems or people who lack the ability to control themselves financially. If this is the case, what are the opponents' proposed solutions? Should these prices be regulated by government somehow? If so, then one would have to argue that any consumer product should be price controlled by legislation. What if Johnny gets the new dragon-style armor set for his Cobra action figure and Billy can't afford it and gets jealous? What if Billy can't control himself and spends his allowance on the dragon armor anyway? Now, Billy can't get that extra snack pack for his lunchbox. Poor Billy... Where do we draw the line on what products are regulated? Weak-minded people will waste their money on anything. 

Bottom line is that a company makes a product and sets a price and the market will determine whether that price is acceptable. ""But if they sold them for way cheaper, so many more people would buy them and overall they would make more money."" No. They have very smart people doing very complex maths to determine how to maximize profitability. Several studies have shown that free-to-play games make far more money from a very small percentage of the player base (""whales"") spending very large amounts of money, as opposed to lower pricing and volume sales. If being as profitable as possible is greedy or wrong is a different conversation entirely. There is merit in non-profit economic models. But in the model we live under, profit is good and leads to further development and support for the product we're using. 

It still *feels* bad to see a single digital outfit selling for $20. So, understanding the above sentiment, why do we still feel we're being gouged? My persepective is that those of us who feel this way grew up buying games for set price with all content. We would go to the store, drop our $60 on the counter (probably 3 $10s 4 $5s and 10 $1s because we had to save that allowance for weeks, if not months), take it home and that's it. We have our game. We will never see popups asking to buy Mario a ""giant bulge"" overalls skin for $20. Cool. But that system has its own drawbacks as well. Before DLCs, if the game had bugs, exploits or other issues, too bad. There is no further development going on for this game. There is an exploit in Super Mario World to this day that you can finish the game in the first level by exploiting the code and forcing a switch to end credits. This is relevant to the conversation about FNBR because a prolonged revenue stream with in game purchases means that, even if a player doesn't spend a dime, they will get full support including weekly updates with code fixes and new content. A game like FNBR will always be evolving, rather than having a 5 hour play through and put it down like a ton of the $60 games of our youth. 

All this is not to mention the Battle Pass option. A more frugal player can utilize this if they want some cosmetics. One can acquire tons of loot for much lower per item price - just with skins, you're getting the outfits, gliders, pickaxes at well under a buck a piece.

Now, for the ME part. I personally have ~$180 in this game since September. I've purchased one $20.00 skin so I could put its wings on my other toys. I have a couple $15.00 pickaxes. I play almost every day. And I will never break the bank for cosmetic items. 

TL;DR: I don't believe we get to tell a company how to set their prices because people lack personal financial responsibility or because a new pricing model doesn't line up with one we prefer. Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE and SMASH THAT LIKE BUTTON if you enjoy the content. 

*There's no gambling in FNBR. There is an item with a price tag. Customer gets to buy or not buy what they want. I believe there is room for regulation on loot crates in games with open trading markets where there is a low cost crate with random chance to get items that are potentially very valuable and can be traded for real money. This can be equated to lottery tickets or other gambling that is traditionally regulated.

As it stands, reaching lvl 100 with the battle pass gives you 1500 V-bucks, which when you consider that a legendary skin costs 2000V-Bucks, it is a little unbalanced. Not to mention that it costs $40aud to buy them with micro transactions. 

I think possibly introducing something like 1000 for a win, 500 for second and 100 for third might make reaching these awesome skins without spending money more achievable.

Edit: Yes 1000 is unreasonable. Maybe 100 for a win, 50 for 2nd and 10 for 3rd. It’s the idea I’m pitching, not the amount. I just want some way to earn them consistently in game. ",FortNiteBR

The battle axe is nice but the early skins as well as the glider and back bling on the fort knight set is just so bad. Not to mention the back bling is identical? No one is going to use them again.

Battle pass 2 has really nice stuff and the future battle passes will only get better right, there's going to be no reason at all to use any early stuff from the first battle pass, which is a shame. And by early stuff I'm talking about the fort knight set. 

My point really is that the game is growing and it's going to keep growing. In a year time, the battle pass 1 will not have much value. Yes I know owning a battle pass 1 does not make you an early player. But the point is that battle pass 1 is the first of its kind and is already underwhelming. It's already in the shadows to battle pass 2. The content is just way better and future battle passes will only be better. And I know it's not a viable option to mend every previous battle pass however, this is the first of its kind and I think the players who own it should be rewarded. 

My suggestion, give the battle pass 1 owners a nice cape like the new skin.The cape ties in with the whole fort knight theme. A small generic cape that players can use with their battle pass 3,4 etc skins. . 

Tl;dr battle pass 1 sucks and in no time there's going to be no reason to use anything from it, please give us a fort knight set cape. ",FortNiteBR

While endgame fights are just as intense and fun, mid game conflicts have had a major decrease. On average the first circle now closes on a remaining 25+ people. 

Beyond the fact that tilted is a very popular POI (understandable as it is dynamic and incredibly fun to play in) it has a far greater effect on the game as a whole. 

The entire city it self in my opinion puts too much strain on loading. Especially consoles. On a console of you get near tilted, frame rate drops for seconds at a time, the game freezes, fights become unpredictable, and the city won’t fully load. This happens at a lot of POIs but it is the worst at tilted. 

For example, tonight me and my squad landed tilted. The entire night every POI besides tilted was incredibly high traffic, and laggy. We thought tilted would be the answer. To our surprise not a single person besides us went to tilted, yet for some reason the lag there was immense and far worse than any other POi.

I'm so tired of dying in the first minute of every game, it's gonna be nice being able to play 15+ minutes and have a chance to earn 5-10 kills.

Without SBMM, its hard for me to improve, because I'm constantly getting rxped in the beginning of every game. 

How am i supposed to learn End Game strategys, if I can never make it to the end game?

My prediction is that competitive play will come out with the release of Season 4. 

**TL;DR** Epic stated they will release information regarding competitive play in the upcoming weeks. So an announcement in 3-4 weeks, followed by implementation a few weeks later, falls right in line with a Season 4 release.

Unfortunately, this is an aspect that does not AT ALL carry over to versus PVP play, and needs vaulted.  
  
They have very, very little tactical value and are EXTREMELY un-fun.  
  
You either walk around using your camera like a bobblehead in buildings looking for traps on ceilings (nobody ever sees a ceiling in third-person, why would we be able to trap there?)  
  
OR  
  
you die to them in one of the least satisfying deaths possible.  
  
There is no other option, pick one.   I *highly* suggest we pick the third option and **vault traps**.      
    
  

EDIT - This isn't a rant post about traps, I rarely die to them.  Get your gatekeeping heads out of your fucking asses, it doesn't matter how long I've been playing, it's easy to see that it's a garbage mechanic.  Keep being the typical reddit hype moron boys and I'll laugh and quote this when this shit crashes and burns just like the rest.   
  
As soon as the hype phase of this game is over, epic is going to have to address the core gameplay issues which you've all been ignoring.  The issues are there, I've given you a chance to see them, fuck if I care if your game dies now.

I can be walking, running, shooting, building, looting, and boom, crashes. 

I don't get an error so I can't even google what the problem is. I tried contacting support but, unfortunately they couldn't assist me with this issue. 

I'm kind of at a loss for what to do and was hoping maybe this gets some visibility or something by someone who has/knows what I'm going through.

To give additional information, the troubleshooting options I've tried are:

- Reinstalling Windows (from a USB, like literally fresh reinstall).

- Reinstalling the Launcher/Fortnite itself (deleting them from my PC and reinstalling the launcher, then reinstalling the game via the launcher).

- Turning all my settings to the very lowest possible settings, including the audio settings. The crashes still persisted even on the lowest settings.

- Playing other games extensively to see if they also crash, and none did aside from Fortnite.

The following is my dxdiag, I'm kind of computer illiterate so I don't really know if my specs meet the requirement, but I'm pretty sure they do and I recently replaced my graphics card so I don't think it's a hardware issue, especially considering other games ran fine.

I used to be just like you thinking these guys are stupid there is no sbmm just coincidence and players getting better.

I thought that way until they allowed xbox pc cross progression so it reset my stats (because I am playing on my xbox account on pc).

I haven't played in a while on pc so I was extremely rusty, my settings didn't feel right, and I was shaking like crazy. I got 7 kills and made it to top 5 my first match. 

I would say 6 of those kills were not deserved and I should have lost those fights. People rarely built and had no awareness.

Compared to before where everyone would build and I would normally die top 25 with 4 kills while extremely warmed up and doing well.


You might just be saying, oh it is because of Drake causing an influx of new players.

The problem with that is that on xbox it is the same as before but on pc, where I had the fresh stat reset, it was incredibly easy.

I played 20 matches on xbox and a decent bit on pc so it isnt just 1 or 2 games.

What do you guys think?",FortNiteBR

We don't spend money for extra tiers and earn battle stars by playing, winning and completing daily/weekly challenges.

My issue is that, I'm *level*  61 and he is *level* 57, but he is still a higher *tier* than me (I'm tier 57 and he's tier 58). Since I have an extra 15 or so battle stars than him (due to being  higher level) why aren't I a higher tier than him?

Has his daily challenges been worth 10 battle stars or have I not been receiving battle stars? We can't figure out why he's higher than me.

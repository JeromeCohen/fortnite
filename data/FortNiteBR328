You'd drop somewhere on the edge, get the entire loot to yourself and end up with full shields, enough spares to get full shield 3 more times, scars/ snipes/ explosives etc..

Where as if you drop somewhere like tilted or retail you get into plenty of fights and always come out worse off early game, you lose shields, hp, mats and ammo. And come out in a very bad state. Killing people in early/ mid game doesn't reward the player enough because people don't have things worth looting.

I feel like your first 3 kills should reward you with mats + ammo or something. For example first kill gives 30 of each mat (90 mats is very helpful early game) and a clip of each ammo, next kill gives 20 of each mat and 60% of a clip and last kill gives 10 of each mat and 30% of a clip.

I feel like avoiding confrontation in this game is too rewarding for a pvp game.

This may also help with the fact at these stages you farm 300~ mats get into one fight and come out with nothing. Then you go back to hitting trees for 2 minutes again which is very fun...

Also i think loot on the edges of the map, the more safer and less trafic areas should be lowered, if people want to play it safe, have an entire area to themselves or only fight 1-2 people then it shouldn't be so rewarding.

It's a weird concept that the more risky a place you land the less loot, mats, ammo and heals you come out with.

Less risk should = Less loot
More risk should = More potential loot",FortNiteBR

Thanos as a marketing tool for Avengers? Really? Come on.

Skins are just pop culture references.

If you're at a reasonable age and can acknowledge all this while still playing, that's great.

However, I fear for children who do not have the capacity to know how much they're being marketed to. Kids even make fun of each other for not having certain skins. The designs of then are set up to make this happen, even if unknowingly.

&amp;nbsp;  
Our newest item went live this week - the Jetpack! With it we introduced a new concept of “Limited Time Items”. These items can change gameplay in a big or unique way. The key difference is that these items will only be available for a limited time (we’re still locking down exact timing, but we’ll give you a heads up).
&amp;nbsp;  
In addition, we’re closely monitoring data (including your feedback) regarding this particular item.  Our goal with the Jetpack is to provide a fun and balanced experience, with exciting new gameplay possibilities.

I am currently playing on PC with a Xbox One Elite controller. I have 23k kills putting me at #280 in the world. In this thread I will try to explain what helps me get many 20+ kill gameplays daily against keyboard users.

**My set up**
Controller:
I have an Xbox One Elite wireless controller; I am using the bottom left paddle as (A) and the bottom right paddle as (B)

Sensitivity:
This is very big; and also the biggest disadvantage for controller players when it comes to building. I play at 7; which for me bridges the gap between faster building and still being able to control my aim when hipfiring etc.

Button Layout:
One of the best improvements for controller users is the release of builder pro. If you are not on builder pro, do yourself a favor and switch. It took me about a week to adjust.

**Tips**

Peeking:
Peeking is tough on controller with the reason being the crouch button is how you aim. Going in/out of crouch slightly adjusts your aim from human error. To avoid this, I have also mapped my d-pad to an additional crouch allowing me to pop up-shoot-crouch down very smoothly. I crouch with my left hand and aim and shoot with my right, allowing each hand to be independent on task. 
Example: https://clips.twitch.tv/SmellyTriumphantPresidentStoneLightning

Aim assist:
Aim assist is highly frowned upon but only controller players know it is necessary in order to keep up with point and shoot mouse players. A common tip is to ""quickscope"" with shotguns milliseconds before shooting in order to have the most accurate shot while not being stuck ADS. This is done, obviously, by quickly tapping the left trigger right before you shoot while your reticle is already near the enemy. This will focus your spread and help you land headshots or full body shots.
Exmaple: 
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/239044423

Double Pump:
(I only include this for the noob friendly players)
Double pump is vital in the game in the current state due to its DPS. There's no other gun in the game that can do the amount of damage a pump shotgun can with the rate of fire it has. On controller, double pump is easily achieved by having your shotguns side by side in your inventory, and swapping between the two after each shot. The more you use it, the easier the rhythm is to pick up.
Exmaple:
https://clips.twitch.tv/KawaiiAgileTildeVoHiYo

Paddles:
I have my left paddle as (A) jump and my right paddle as (B) build. Having jump on my lower back left paddle allows me to be jumping constantly without having to remove my right thumb from the right analog stick allowing me to move my aim while jumping; something that is vital for shooters. 
As for my lower back right paddle for building, this is just as vital as going in and out of build is something very common and to have to remove your thumb from the analog stick puts you at a very high disadvantage mid fights. 

**WISH LIST**
A controller player's dream:
* Separate sensitivities for when in/out of build
* Ability to remap buttons as a keyboard can
* REDUCED (not removed) aim assist from editing
* New input to enter edit mode (anything besides holding down a button)
* Aim assist through big windows


Will add more to come.",FortNiteBR

I am personally at level 71 and wont have any problem getting fully loaded omega. but i have worked for that with probably over 100 hours of gameplay. and 100\+ wins

The knocked down system. 

It's such a downer when you get in a fight, do some damage, but get knocked down and immediately executed. Sometimes even while you team is still shooting at them. Then you're left to just wait out the match, which feels terrible.

To that end, I'd propose the knocked down system be removed. Instead, you just die and drop your loot like normal, but you also leave a grave marker behind for your teammates to rez you if they win the fight. I think this would be awesome for a few reasons.

1. When you kill someone, you want their loot immediately for the next fight. Now you get it.
2. There's now an actual penalty for death, you have to start over looting.

So I used to be a huge collector of Jordans back in the day and something I've noticed is even though the shoes are 30 years old and just being rereleased over and over, people still go nuts over them and collect them. The big reason is they make minor changes to the shoe each rerelease which then doesn't devalue the older versions. 

I feel like this would be a great way to make sure people dont get bored with their wukong or love ranger just because it's been released 20 times and everyone has one. They'd still wear it proudly with the original backbling. 

This allows others to get the cool skins they missed out on and allows the players who thought they were getting a rare skin,  maintain some rarity to it. 

--also I realize it's all in the eye of the beholder. Some will say, only buy skins you like not ones because they're rare, but some people like to collect things and maintaining rarity is big for them. ",FortNiteBR

There could be absolutely nothing more beneficial to this game at this point than a new map, and people keep asking for frivolous shit all the time yet *nobody ever* suggests a new map is needed.

 • The lawsuit is ongoing

 • They are suing for similarities with UI styles, the maximum number of players, blue circle effect, minimap, weapons, concept of stamina recovery, etc. 

 • Currently, Epic Games is trying implement a PC room system in South Korea; however, it doesn't seem like the lawsuit will affect this implementation",FortNiteBR

The shadows in this game are excellently done, too well in fact. The amount of information they provide, especially in build battles, is pretty nuts.  In build battles you have to turn your back on your opponent for building purposes and shadows will often let you see opponents movements while not facing them giving you an advantage.

So whats the problem with shadows being a skill based tool that good players can exploit?  Having shadows on absolutely destroys your FPS.  A computer that can run at 144fps at 1080p with viewdistance at max and shadows on is pretty expensive.  I'd like to see shadows removed entirely from battle royale so people with a budget can play without being at a disadvantage.

I realize this may sound silly to some people, especially since a lot of top streamers don't play with shadows on, but the advantages provided are real and as a competitive scene develops people will push for every advantage they can get.",FortNiteBR

Due to the nature of building, most fights end up being close range, and if you're without a shotgun(or two even), you will lose the fight nearly every time. By swapping the damage values, you accomplish a few things. You make the heavy shotgun a better weapon, which due to its rarity, it should be. You also make carrying a pump shotgun less necessary, and reduce the frustration and commonality of being one shot while at full health. The Heavy shotgun will now feel more valuable as a weapon, and the Pump shotgun would be more balanced, especially when considering the oppressive nature of one shots and double pumping in general, especially in a BR game.

So i can imagine this could be an unpopular opinion on this reddit, but Epic should consider BR mode without constriction/building element and only having the gunplay mode - closer to classic BR mode from pubg. 

Now I understand that the building mechanics is what a lot of people enjoy about FNBR and it’s part of its dna - however there are plenty of players that would enjoy it and (like myself) are sticking with pubg, because we don’t enjoy the chaotic building mechanics of the gameplay.  It’s a shame and after prob around 20-25hrs with FNBR i know i will never enjoy current gameplay, unfortunately that means i lose 85% of gun fights and in wave of frustration i go back to pubg. 

Yes, you could say “git gud”, but the reality is that some people will just not enjoy the building part and would enjoy the game otherwise. 

Separate mode focusing on gunplay alone - playfully called something like “Gunfun” would be great entry point to many people that enjoy BR and with time many would possibly play the classic FN mode as well. ",FortNiteBR
310,ShiningRarity,1527203621,8lx3jk,18,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8lx3jk/thoughts_on_jetpacks_and_why_they_should_be/,0,Thoughts on Jetpacks and why they should be removed,"Before I get into the details as to why I think that Jetpacks are a big problem for the long-term health of the game and should be removed, I will say upfront that I am fully aware that they are supposed to be limited-time items and Epic have said that they will remove it in the future. However, during their State of Development post, they said that they are monitoring feedback on the item and they also said that due to popular demand they were considering keeping a big team mode on at all times, so if the item WAS super popular I have no doubts that they would end up not removing it because people liked it. To be clear, they are clearly looking for feedback on the Jetpack and just because they said that it's going to get removed at some point doesn't mean that it's immune to criticism now. Before getting into the negatives, I will say that the jetpacks are a fun item to play around with, and I think that them being around for a short period of time or in a limited time mode isn't the end of the world. Variety is cool and I don't think that they need to be removed instantly. But at some point they need to go, and here's why I think that:  

&gt; The game doesn't give you the tools to deal with a flying player: To illustrate this point, Overwatch has a character called Pharah who also has a jetpack that allows her to fly for extended periods of time, and has a rocket launcher to deal damage from above. For many of the heroes in the game, it can be very difficult to even hit her while she's flying around in the air, especially ones with projectiles that have travel speed. However, there are also characters like Soldier 76, McCree, and Widowmaker that have highly damaging hitscan weapons that can deal reliable damage to Pharah at most ranges and either force her to be more careful with flying around, or make her have to switch to another character because being in the sky is too dangerous. Fortnite does not have any weapons that can reliably threaten jetpacking players that aren't in shotgun range. The sniper is hard enough to hit moving grounded players with, shooting a jetpacking player is borderline impossible. The various rifles are by far your best bet at mid/long range, but the weapon bloom means that dpsing them is very luck-based so you're forced to use FSA and be super good at aiming to pose any real threat to them. There's just not really a good way to take out people in the sky outside of shooting them at close-range with a shotgun unless you have insanely good aim or get lucky with the weapon bloom.  

&gt; They remove the threat of fall damage: One of the only real counters to people building super tall fortresses is that you can shoot out the base of their structure and force them to take fall damage. Jetpacks mean that if you're smart with your usage, you will never have to worry about fall damage, which means that you don't have to worry about securing the base of your structure to make it difficult to destroy or building unsafe structures to temporarily gain a height advantage. Not only does it remove counterplay but it also lowers the skill ceiling for building because now you can be a lot more sloppy and not face any punishment besides temporarily losing height. (which can be easily be gained back because you have a jetpack) Some people like that it makes Sky Fortresses more viable but I think that's a bad thing because it encourages people to just sit around in their fort and try to 3rd-person snipe people, which is not fun to me. Encouraging new playstyles is not good if the playstyles aren't fun to actually play against.  

&gt; They remove a lot of skill in building: You don't have to worry as much about having to out-build your opponent to gain a height advantage. You can just use your jetpack to do that instead. Sure if you're good enough you can still out-build a person with a jetpack, but it's undeniable that the jetpack gives you a massive edge in building battles and can be used to make up for lack of skill and still out-maneuver your opponent.  

&gt; They make already powerful weapons even stronger: The way that jumping in this game works makes weapons like the shotguns, rocket launcher, and grenade launcher much more powerful because most other weapons become very inaccurate while jumping while those weapons suffer minor penalties and are still very much usable. The jetpack makes it much easier to maneuver around the enemy structure to hit them with the shotgun, and it also gives you a free height advantage to use the RPG from. Furthermore as I pointed out earlier due to the difficulty of hitting flying characters at range it makes it very easy to close the gap with a jetpack and get into a scenario where you can out-maneuver people with the jetpack and kill them with the shotgun or RPG if you found one.  

&gt; They give players too much of an upper hand in combat: Granted this complaint could also be levied at the Grenade Launcher and the RPG but the jetpack just gives you way more options then your opponent has. You don't have to use destroyable buildings to gain a height advantage on your opponent. You don't have to worry about fall damage. You have many more options to choose from compared to someone that doesn't have a jetpack, and the only downside is you have to use up one of your equipment slots for it.  

&gt; It's not avoidable and there's no real good way to know what you're up against until you see it: Many of the problems I have listed here can also be directed at Hop Rocks, and although I don't like them for similar reasons, at least with Hop Rocks they always spawn in select locations and the effects are only temporary. If you don't want to fight against someone with the Hop Rock effect, you can just avoid where they spawn. (sometimes later on you don't have this option but by that time most if not all of them will have already been used up) And if you do end up in conflict with someone that has the effect, you can either try to get it yourself or try to time out the effect because it's only temporary. And lastly their effects are super obvious. Usually since they're temporary and give you a speed boost as well as making a distinct noise, it's never a mystery as to whether or not someone is under their effect. There are strategic options to dealing with them. The jetpack on the other hand is a complete crapshoot. Unless you get a good look at their back or previously see them use the jetpack you have no real way of knowing if your enemy has one or not. Anyone can have one anywhere potentially at any point in the game. If you don't like playing against it you don't have any way of avoiding it or trying to even the playing field.  

They allow you to fundamentally break rules of the game in a way that no other item or weapon allows you to do: Stuff like fall damage and having to use buildings to gain a height advantage are core mechanics in the game that the whole combat system is based around. Even if the item was balanced (which I don't think it is) I don't think it would be healthy for the game to have an item that just allows you to ignore core rules that everyone else has to follow.  

Again, it's a fun item and it's neat to have in the game for a short period of time, or in an LTM, but the item I don't think is sustainable for the future of the game.",FortNiteBR

It was meant to be the fastest control layout, but with Turbo Building and ""pyramid-stairs,"" combat pro is faster.

The reason for this is that you have to double tap the specific button for the item you want to place it. The only reason why I think Epic didn't let us just tap once to place is because if that's the case, then we wouldn't be able to edit an item before placing it.

Solution: When we want to build, we would hit circle to enter build mode, and then all we have to do is tap once to place a building piece. But if we want to edit a piece before placing it, instead of tapping the circle button, we would have to hold it, doing so would make building mode the way builder pro is currently, so we could edit a piece and then place it.

Please let me know what you think. I didn't think about it much, so there might be something that makes my solution unusable.

Also, please forgive me for any grammar mistakes, english is not my first langage.",FortNiteBR

We both landed at the crater, you got the only gun in the area, the pursuit began...  We did two laps of the truck with me running away, you landed a couple of shots.  But then the shooting stopped...
You waved...
I danced...
We danced together, not often does a Wick show this much compassion.
You dropped me a med kit to patch myself up while we danced the minutes away to the first circle, knowing a mutual unspoken pact had been made.  We ran together to Pleasant Park when we saw someone on top the northernmost house, we opened fire simultaneously.  The shotguns were drawn and a battle commenced.

Heartbreak.  I saw your loot explode before my eyes as you took a pump to the head, there was no amount of shield that would have saved you.  I saw red.  Armed with just a white tactical shotgun I opened fire, not stopping until his body fell to the floor lifeless.  Just know your death was not in vain, I not only avenged your death but went on to get that Victory Royale, in a match I was only still in down to your compassion when I was unarmed.  Even more poetically, the shotgun was the gun you dropped for me back at the crater.

So thank you John, for sparing my life and teaching me that not all Wicks are try hard psychos and I don't think there is another game in the world that this kind of random mercy would be shown.

Punched my bed and got a knife and cut holes in it. This game is making me insane. I just want to win one fucking game. One game epic games. Im tired of this rage inducing bloom system and freezing. Pubg doesn't make me this mental since it's realistic. No rng, no skins, no cartoon character taunting on your death and more. Fortnite makes me rage cause of this. Shotguns, skins, rng system, and people saying defaults are trash. Why the fuck do we have this default shit when you're saying their trash for not wasting money on this game. Ninja rages at this. Everyone rages. No one has my rage to the point when you die by a shotgun and VIOLENTLY FUCKING PUNCH YOUR BED BECAUSE OF THE GARBAGE PERSON. It's rage inducing. ALL CAUSED BY SOLO. Solo is the rage fest for me. Shotguns, people that come out of nowhere, People saying im garbage and shit. I rage because Im not winning and I rage at that since people will think im garbage. I have 5 solos and 10 squad wins and no duos. Im pretty sure shotguns pisses off everyone. The fact that someone builds and jumps over me and I aim up and hit them and do 9 dmg and they come back down to the ground and can one shot just makes me want to rage. But I feel like it's me or the game. Since when I die I feel the rage or inducing of it. Skins are a small aspect. They make me rage when a default or a another skin kills me. Why do people buy skins and get called as good. People call the john wicks good when some are bad. Why do we have this skin shit to where if your a default your garbage. I was playing squads 3rd season and someone kept telling to buy a skin. Since skins=wins. It was half true since I kept getting more close to top 10 and top 25. But I felt kinda since it's p2w. (Before you say This isn't p2w your retarded hear my definition) My definition of p2w is when you decide to buy something ingame and you start getting good with it. Meaning I was garbage at fortnite but I bought the season pass and got more good. And yes fortnite isn't p2w. But I feel it since most people with skins are good. And I haven't seen one pro twitch or livestreamer that hasn't use a skin. I hate that. I like that I got good but I hated since I got more good. But solo is a rage inducing fest. Shotguns and rng= Most rage inducing combo. rng and guns can piss off people. Since I can get 1 shotted or do 9 dmg to a head. But the freezing is raging. I hate that when I got shot at and was 33 health I couldn't even get a shot in for some fucking reason. Aimed it at the head and the guy gun had loaded faster. This game makes me go more mental. I litterally go to people's name invite them to people and go fully asylum mental on them screaming at them and getting mad over this game. Why? Because I want to be more good I want people to not say im garbage or anything. Everyone talks about this and I can not stop playing this. It's more raging when I was playing fortnite yesterday and got the loading screen and had a disconnection back to the br game menu. Please nerf the shotguns and rng. Rng is basically a YOU'RE FUCKING GARBAGE WE DON'T LIKE YOU or YOU DESERVE THE HIGH DAMAGE AND YOU CAN WIN. Rng makes no sense. Fortnite and pubg are both br but fortnite is cartoony and pubg is realistic. Most Games like fortnite don't have to apply to damage. They have damage pop ups when you shoot a target and a rng system. Pubg has no rng. It has a health bar with no numbers. And it's more geographically realistic. But why do I take it seriously? Is it the fact Im 13 and my mental mind takes it seriously? Or Is it that Im butthurt and just mad I can't win. I just want to be good and not always get mad for dying. My mom really doesn't even care about why I rage. I try explaining to her but she really doesn't give a fuck. I just want to explain it to her. I was at the doctors yesterday and didn't speak up since I had a lecture about going to a new high school. I wanted to talk to my doctor about why I rage at fortnite and About my left leg hurting when I bend it (The knee part hurts for some reason) But I rage and I can't help it.  Squad and duos make me rage at not anytime. Solo is a ragefest for me since rng, shotguns, snipers, rpgs, and more. Skins shouldn't be a thing to where if you buy a skin you get good or that skins=win shit. I just feel that. Pubg rage is not alot. It's just a simply damn or fuck in a funny laughing matter or me saying damn he got me. But fortnite makes me rage hard as ever. Squads and duo don't make me rage. I don't get why Im raging since people don't define a player by their solo wins. People shouldn't be called defaults or noobs. What if they don't want to waste money? But pretty much my dumbass will still play this when Im addicted. Playing together in fortnite doesn't make me rage. Pubg solos don't make me rage either. Shotguns and rng are everyone friend or foe in battle. Rng is in save the world. Rng is in mostly non realistic games. ",FortNiteBR

**1 kill \- Enhance Perk:** Dog Ears. Can hear destruction from further away.

**2 kills \- Enhance Perk:** Dog Ears. Can hear footsteps louder.

**3 kills \- Enhance Perk:** Dog Ears. Can hear footsteps from further away.

**4 kills \- Unlock Perk:** Eagle Eye. Any recent destruction gets highlighted. \(For example: A tree that's been hit recently will appear red.\)

**5 kills \- Enhance Perk:** Eagle Eye. Any recent footsteps get highlighted.

**6 kills \- Enhance Perk:** Eagle Eye. Any scoped weapon will reflect light, giving you a visual warning. \(basically just a perma muzzle flash when a sniper/scoped AR looks your direction.\)

**7 kills \- Unlock Perk:** Cat's balance. Take 10&amp;#37; reduced fall damage. \(unstackable\)

**8 kills \- Enhance Perk:** Cat's Balance. Take 20&amp;#37; reduced fall damage.

**9 kills \- Enhance Perk:** Cat's Balance. Take 30&amp;#37; reduced fall damage.

**10 kills \- Unlock Perk:** Cheetah's Sprint. After discovering a clue \(destruction, footsteps, scope\), you will gain 20&amp;#37; increased movement speed towards nearby enemy players until you either deal or take damage.

**15 kills \- Enhance Perk:** Cheetah's Sprint. When a teammate takes damage, you will gain 20&amp;#37; increased movement speed toward nearby teammates until get near them or the until timer runs out. When solo, taking damage with this perk will grant you 20&amp;#37; increased movement speed towards nearby enemy players until you deal damage or the timer runs out.

[Suggestion] Reconnaissance Drone

The reconnaissance drone is an epic rarity gadget which is launched into the air where the player has the ability to view the surrounding areas from the sky.

The drone has limited fuel - Ot can move (in all directions) for 20 seconds before it runs out of fuel, when that happens the drone will explode (dealing no damage) - The drone can hover in space for around 40 seconds (if not moving at all) until it runs out of fuel.

The drone can be shot out of the sky and has 25 health.

The drone can be stood on for drone riding.

The user can exit the drone ride by pressing the exit button. (B on xbox, X on playstation, a special button on mobile and enter on PC)

The user cannot move or interact with anything other than the drone whilst controlling the drone unless exited or until the drone is destroyed or runs out of fuel.

Thanks for reading!

The Playground LTM will load you into the Battle Royale Map with some adjusted settings. 

Battle and build to your heart's content with an extended period of time to roam around the map as well as increased resource generation. All treasure chests and ammo crates will be spawned, try droppin’ in different spots and scope out the loot. Friendly fire is on so you can scrimmage with your squad (up to 4 friends per match), but fear not you’ll respawn immediately. 

Oh … and Lloads of Llamas.

I'll be building, and the next moment I'll fall off the building I was on and I die. 

I have the option to get faster internet from the same provider \(only broadband provider out where I live\), but I want to know if having something like 25mbps down would fix my issues. If not, I won't pay the extra money since I can browse the web and stream movies just fine on the connection I currently have.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",FortNiteBR

(this time with the flair set),"Link to original comments:   https://redd.it/8lt4y9

So I was in fill squads last night on PS4. I have a mic and asked if anyone else did. The next ten minutes were absolutely horrifying to me and I've been a girl on the internet for nearly 20 years.

Two of the guys on my squad (one was probably late teens, early twenties, the other in his early teens based on voices) proceeded to tell me:

    I am trash at the game because I am a girl;
    That I should be sucking their genetalia because that was my place;
    I was called every demeaning name to women you can think of (b_tch, c_nt, whore, and a few I have never had directed at me before);

At this point, it didn't really bother me. I've heard all of this before because, as I stated above, I've been a girl, on the internet, in gaming communities, for nearly 20 years. I gave as good as I get and trash talking is nothing new to me.

What really got me (and it didn't phase me at the time, but it ate at me the rest of the night into this morning) was when the younger of the two REPEATEDLY told me that all my attitude problems could be fixed if I just got raped. Literally, this kid told me I needed to be raped. And the other two guys on the team (including one who had been nearly silent till now) agreed with him.

This is not a witch hunt. I am not asking for sympathy. I just want you to understand that this is never okay to tell a girl she needs to be raped. Imagine how you would feel if someone said this to your wife/girlfriend/sister/mother/daughter. And if you see this happening, say something. I can tell them to go to hell all I want, but guys that think this is okay don't listen to women. But they might listen to a man.

Thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

Edit: I apparently can't format for shit.

EDIT 2: The only redeeming thing to this was they all went down hard to another squad which I wiped, they screamed for a revive, so I did the only thing I felt was appropriate - take all the good loot, build out over the water, and drowned myself. They weren't going to get a carry from me.

I was appealed by PUBG at the, but chose to download Fortnite instead because it seemed to do something unique. I've enjoyed this game for a while now, but it's simply a boring and predictable experience now.

Throughout the previous Season, me and my friends would play Squad every Friday and Saturday, feeling we had a good chance to get wins (even while entertaining some light drink), having tremendous fun along the way. We had our usual places to drop (Motel, Moisty Mire, Lonely Lodge, or if we were feeling in form, Tilted Towers), we had our own unique strats (one of us would scout ahead while the rest looted up, one would be the medic etc.), and we would generally get a win every couple of weeks. But we didn't really care for winning, because the game encouraged teamplay in a way we'd not really experienced before on PS4. All in all, it was a great game that we all looked forward to after having played other games all week.

However, since the 'Builder Pro' controller settings came into the game, we haven't really had the fun we used to. Now, when we scope out positions we would see rival teams fighting in an absolute mess of ramp woods, building with speed and precision that we could barely comprehend. From then on, even if we outnumbered a team and had the jump on them, we would be hesitant - particularly if they were John Wicks. We would now try to actively avoid other teams rather than engage, because it was so frustrating to play against 'builders'.

Now, you may be tempted to say 'just build lol'. We did. We tried. We failed. The fact is that it is difficult to build on console and even more so if you don't play day in day out. You may be tempted to call us salty, or - even to borrow a phrase from the best series on PS4 - 'git gud', but simply, it is incredibly frustrating to go against a player who can build a base with 1 health and finish you instantly. That's why I'm deleting this game and moving on to better balanced FPSs again, like H1Z1, Battlefield, and Battlefront. It's so sad that such a cool mechanic as building has evolved into something that breaks the game for casual players such as myself. 

Moreover, I am sorry to point this out, but Fortnite has an incredibly unethical way of raising money. You essentially pay £8 every two months, plus whatever you choose to pay for skins. They are taking advantage of you. Seriously, next time you consider buying a skin or battle pass, consider how much money you (or your parents) have paid for this game. Your wallet (or that of your parents) will thank you if you just play for free.

TL;DR - Fortnite used to be fun, but playing against builders is far too frustrating for us old codgers. Also, put your money elsewhere, this game is exploiting you.",FortNiteBR

Even though I have been playing FortniteBR on PC since day 1 of release, I'm a pleb who never spent a dollar on the game. I also have over 800 solo wins. This isn't to brag but simply to give you a bit of background information. 

Overall, I feel like the game is fairly well balanced but there are a few outliers that are clearly identifiable:

**SHOTGUNS**

They are the bread and butter of this game for a reason. Dual pump is a nasty combo that can output massive burst damage. No other weapon in the game can output as much damage with only a few rounds. It's basically a loophole that they never intended, yet they are doing basically nothing to fix it. [Eric Williamson said many times](https://i.redd.it/1mpf9mh1t9f01.jpg) that ""they are looking into it"" but very little is being done. On a similar note, Pump + Tact, or Pump + Heavy Shotgun might be a bit less powerful, but still overpowered and unbalanced. The solution is very simple but they are afraid to implement it: 

Only one Shotgun should be possible to be carried at a time. If you pick up a different Shotgun, it would be automatically swapped with the one currently equipped. The same way Backpacks are currently designed. Problem solved. 

**SHIELDS**

The addition of mini shields was a welcomed addition but the way they are currently designed is, in my view, unbalanced. They are a must have item and many times you'll want to leave big shields behind in favor of minis. The reason why they are so strong derive from the fact that you can pop them quickly mid fight and they stack to 10. Also, let's keep in mind that:

* 10 Minis equal 250 possible HP (cap at 50)
* 2 Big Shields equal 100 possible HP
* 1 Chug Jug equal 199 possible HP

My philosophy when it comes to consumables (shield/health) is that they should be used, to an extent, mainly for recovery after fights, not during. For example, bandaids and medkits are very well balanced for this reason. What I would suggest is the following:

*Mini Shields*

* A small regeneration potion that grants 1 shield per second for 25 seconds.
* Grants 25 Shield, to a maximum of 50.
* Uncommon rarity.
* Consumed in 2 seconds.
* Cannot be consumed while moving.

*Slurps*

* A potion that instantly restores 25 shield and 25 health (up to 100 health)
* Consumed in 2 seconds.
* Epic rarity


____________________

Making mini shields a regeneration potion with a heal over time effect would make it in line with the rest of the potions.  It would also make big shields more appealing. If you have 5 seconds during a fight to pop a big shield, you deserve it. Popping small shields left and right during a fight drastically changes the gameplay in a bad way in my opinion.

i need some suggestions from you. Currently im lvl 47 and I want to come lvl 100 by the end of this season. How do I manage this? I calculated that i should play 6 hours a day (with my average exp) to come lvl 100. I  like this game and it's fun and I really want to play the 6 hours a day but how can I stay motivated? After every long game like 15 minutes i feel like i played for hours and feel very exhausted. How do you manage do grind your game and play for many hours? Most of the time I play solo.

I hope for some nice tips!",FortNiteBR

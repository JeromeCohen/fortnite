I feel like Extra styles for people who purchased a skin first is ridiculous and not good for the community. The fact that having something somewhat rare and feel that they are better than other people because of it isis ridiculous and unhealthy for the community. I dont even think that the skull trooper and ghoul trooper should have gotten special trearment. But I can somewhat understand why Epic did it considering that they were the first 2 skins added to the game. 

Its especially unneeded now since it was December to January where people started playing Battle royale. You dont buy a skin expecting it to be rare. You buy a skin because you like it. If you buy ill skin just because you feel that it will be exclusive, then you're an idiot. (Valentines day and Easter skins for example)

We don't need ""OG"" styles. ",FortNiteBR

new games but I never got normal pings. (Before
SEA servers were added I used to connect to North Asia and I had 150 pings). So I am guessing I am getting connected to North Asia for some

HOWEVER, ive been playing for the last few hours and Jesus are the biplanes awful. They take a ton of damage, move around very quickly, and essentially have a turret mounted on the front. Currently all the hot drops are war zones with multiple planes zooming around spraying down on your build fights, and there is pretty much nothing you can do about it.

Hopefully this is addressed quickly. The idea of having flying mobility items is great and definitely has its place in this game. But agile turret tanks everywhere is pretty broken, and is really taking away from such a fan/exciting patch.

Edit: in a 1 on 1 situation vs a plane it is manageable. However due to how many planes there are, there are usually 3 to 4 above each hot drop. Taking on multiple planes while fighting players on the ground goes from challenging to broken very quickly",FortNiteBR

So season 4 arrived and I bought the pass because I was already working on the fortnite and I had liked the skins, which I did not know would have a different system for these skins, I thought it would be the same as last seasons which would only be a very good skin in the 100 category. But during the season everyone was surprised and even liked the news ""I particularly liked"", but to play all day to get such a level is very sickening and demotivating. To this day I have the Omega with the penultimate upgrade and I do not use it at all simply because it is an incomplete skin, ""I am like this, if it is incomplete I already go crazy"". at least release the challenge of the Omega for who had taken the category lv100, I really do not see any problem you do this. Ragnarok and Dire are like that, why would the Omega be special not to get on that list too ??? Excuse me for anything. Having a skin in the game and seeing her incomplete is sad",FortNiteBR
319,GiannisAnteatergumbo,1544077702,a3ldsb,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/a3ldsb/oc_i_made_a_website_that_will_show_a_heat_map_of/,1,[OC] I made a website that will show a heat map of where players drop for a given bus path. Just need some help from you guys to complete the project,"During the fall skirmish trials when streamers were competing for the most squad kills, I became curious where the hottest drops were, so I decided to make this site.

The basic idea is to crowdsource players' landing spots by asking users where they would drop, compile the data and show a heat map overlay of everyone's drop spot (once there are enough data points). That's where you guys come in.


If you have a minute to spare and want to contribute, head over to [fortnitedrops.us](https://fortnitedrops.us) and drop a few markers just like you would in a normal game of Fortnite. It should only take about 2-3 minutes, depending on how decisive you are.


In a couple weeks, the ability to view the heat maps will be released once there are a decent amount of entries.

---

Some things to note:

- There are only 18 possible paths at the moment, so feel free to stop dropping after a while. If there's enough interest, I'll add more paths, including paths that are off-centered. Just wanted to make sure the data wasn't spread so thin that there were only a couple points per path.

- If you like dropping at different locations for solos/duos/squads, assume that you're playing solos.

As the iceberg approached this tiny little island,

In hopes that tomorrow, it would collide with dry-land;

For tomorrow when they wake, there'll be quite a show!

Same thing happened with Moisty.

Now it‚Äôs gonna happen with Flush.

I have gone to Flush maybe 5 times in 4 months- when I do go, no one is EVER there. No one cares about Flush. Never in zone, confusing to loot, far from any hotspots, no one bothers touching it. The only time i‚Äôve seen people there was probably for that one challenge where you had to open chests there in S4.

Tommorow. Mark my words. Now. I want you all to write this shit down. Everyone suddenly loved Flush as soon as the Iceberg fucks it up. If i‚Äôm wrong, and everyone‚Äôs happy it‚Äôs gone, i‚Äôll eat a napkin on video for you guys.

One last thing- I‚Äôm not saying there are not people who actually do like Flush. I‚Äôm saying that there‚Äôs so little of those people, until the Iceberg changes Flush.

But realistically, for me at least, the majority of the stuff in the battlepass doesn't get used. Maybe i'll use one or two of the skins, but most likely not until after the season has concluded. And that's not because they're unattractive to me, it's just because of the other skins that I have and what I prefer. For example I liked the majority of the skins in the battlepass during season 6, but I still haven't used any skin for more than 2 games

For the most part i've been using skins such as the assault trooper or scorpion. There's so many other skins that I have that I typically and most likely prefer over the battle pass skins. 

There's 2 main reasons I'd say that I personally buy the battlepass. The first reason being that the battle pass is part of the season festivities and I just like participating in whats going on in FN. The second reason being that you get a good amount of stuff for an AMAZING DEAL. The skins alone could value near 10,000 vbucks, but you get them for 950. Also a great way to grow the cosmetic collection.

This is just my reasoning for why maybe the battle pass isn't ""needed"" for me personally. This post wasn't meant to be hating or anything like that, I'm just voicing my feeling and approach towards the Battlepass.

With that being said. Less than 12 hours till season 7! Lets get hyped and enjoy",FortNiteBR

Reasons why
1. In the Season 5 and Season 6 teasers the frist 2 ended up have something to do with the tier 1 skins (Drift mask and Huntress pickaxe) and the frist 2 this season were the blue phantom and the female black panther 
2. The last Season 6 teaser showed the tier 100 fully max progressive skin (Dire) so theirs a chance the silhouette in the 3rd teaser is the tier 100 skin
3. The silhouette showed a furry dude with feet that resemble dires but what sticks out is the belt hanging from the dudes waste that belt is the exact same belt that the buff Santa wheres 
Even though you might say the tier 100 has been next to the tier 1 skin in the season loading screens 
Season 4. Carbide was standing next to battle hawk 
Season 5 Drift was standing next to Huntress",FortNiteBR

Sadly I have recently found out that I was DQed despite not being able to pin point why. I am 18 years of age which automatically makes me eligible to compete. I had filled out my eligibility survey the day upon receiving it and I also submitted it before the deadline. I am not in any way, shape or form affiliated and or related to ANY Epic Games Employee. I am super bummed about finding out I did not make the final heats and would like to know if a employee could give me a reason or help me get back into the heats.

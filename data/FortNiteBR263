Is there reason to pick up a green AR anymore?,"I'm late to the Fortnite scene. I started during season 4 and since then have 240 wins with 4000 kills. So I would say I am an average, above average player. But season 5 is kicking my butt. I will have a another player pop out from behind a tree that is 10 m away and start shooting his sub-machine gun and I will muscle memory react to building a wall and ramp just to instantly be on the ground. It doesn't seem like building walls can outpace the 12 rate of fire so the players bullets will hit me and I get shredded while he used 0 mats in the whole engagement. I've also noticed due to the rate of fire of the submachine gun that an AR at medium range can not compete. The sub is landing 2 bullets for every 1 the AR spits out. There is just something about the overall game play during season 5 that just feels off to me. I feel like every engagement is a coin toss. I've read that they think the game is in a good place because there are counters to building but honestly before you could quickly build 4 walls around you the moment a bullet hits you body to buy 2 seconds of mental collection but now you can't do that because a single wall doesn't protect you from the boots on the ground bullet spammer. 

This is just my experience, maybe the overall game might be in a good place for a lot of players IDK. 

I would like some feedback from those winning 30% + of their games, are you relying less on building than you once did. Are you more favoring SMG's for the mid and end game? Help! ",FortNiteBR

24,FourteenthRound,1532107836,90hzaq,14,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90hzaq/flamethrower/,6,Flamethrower,"* Ignites wooden structures and trees, causing the fire to spread to nearby wooden structures and trees.
* Wooden structures will ignite, causing players inside them to take continuous damage, before ultimately being destroyed a few seconds later
* Metal structures will heat, causing any player standing on a metal panel within the structure to take continuous damage
* Stone is immune to the flamethrower
* Extremely effective at close range against players, but short range is the drawback.
* Rare, Epic, and Legendary rarity

This would differentiate the materials a bit and make wood less OP compared to stone and metal. Its main use would be destroying structures or flushing players out of structures, though it would be extremely effective in a fire fight at close range. Its main drawback is its lack of range compared to items of similar tactical application like the rocket launcher, and even c4/nades.  


Plus, imagine how fun it would be to torch a house a player is hiding in, burn the wailing woods down, and ignite that ridiculous 8 story high wooden tower your opponent built in the final 2",FortNiteBR

EpicGames wanted to change the “Double Shotgun Meta” which is why shotguns were once again nerfed and smg’s were buffed. 

I have two suggestions for this; 

1. Changing the rarities of the pump from “green/blue” to “gray/green”  Idea taken from: ( https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/90dmf9/demote_the_pump_back_to_whitegreen_rarity/?st=JJU8A4QM&amp;sh=1b789a1a)

2. Changing how it is that Pumps are working right now. It is a long shot but I say we bring back the old pump! How so? I would say bring back the old pump damages if 200+ in which you could “one pump” anybody however all the other nerfs should stand in the game. For instance the switch delay between shotguns and the pull animation delay.

Before you click away and read something else just hear me out. This is all just my opinion based on playing the game since early March of this year. I hope I made some points you can agree on and I'd like your feedback in the comments.

I've been playing Fortnite since the tail end of Season 3. This was when the Double Pump meta was still going and it was how I learned to play the game. Shotguns and building. It was fun getting wins with this meta, as SMGs weren't buffed and even if you did die, it would be something you could improve on.

Until the Season 4 shotgun nerf patch.

Shotguns were doing less damage per shot, SMG spraying became the new meta, and gathering mats was a gruelling process.

I'm not a player that's been playing since Season 1, so I don't know how the game was then, but just in my duration of playing from March to now, the game has changed drastically. This new Spray &amp; Pray meta has made it so that instead of enjoying the game, I constantly end up getting sprayed by countless inexperienced players and this is what has made me decide that Fortnite is no longer fun.

BUT

If there is some updated changes to SMGs, the double pump or even just some improved shotgun damages added in v5.1 or later, I might play this game again. Epic is constantly adapting for new players so new players can have fun as well , but for the little more than a casual player or a hardcore player, these changes have made the game less enjoyable and it's why I'm uninstalling as of today.",FortNiteBR

* **good aim :** consistently **more than 15000**
* **very good aim :** consistently **more than 25000**
* **legendary aim :** consistently **more than 30000**

My personal best :

2.  **Flick &amp; Reflex training**

* for when people peeks you over a ramp, or by the windows and overall training flick &amp; reflex for sniper shots.

**After doing 5 times your training, calculate your average and see in which Aim Category you are.**

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By the way, the trainer do not depend on the server, so whatever your ping is, you can train like every one.

**WARNING 1 :** To train properly you need to find the sensibility that match with your in-game sensibility, for example, my in-game sensiblity (in Fortnite) is 0,11 with 800 DPI and **I train with 19 in 3D aim trainer.**

**WARNING 2 :** Here, you train in First Person View (FPS) but Fortnite is Third Person View (TPS). So, some people may think it's not the same at all, I don't know. Anyways, this really helped me after a week of training I really hit more headshots.

**WARNING 3 :** The categories of aims are based on my own experience on how bad my aim was and how I improved it.

Furthermore smg’s have much more range than race which will hit for almost nothing unless the enemy is a tile away.

Seriouslyy, the only thing that is quite shitty right now are explosives, which shouldn't have gotten the recent buffs.

Everything else is in the best state since forever.

Double shotgun is gone, which is the best thing that has happened to Fortnite in a long time. I hatet it that I was just forced to play two shotguns or at least two close range guns. But you had to, because everyone else did it.

And I know, I KNOW shotgun + smg was a thing at the end of S4. That doesn't change the fact that double shotgun was still a dominant technique and that you still couldn't stand a chance with single closed range.

You can now use literally every smg as your only closed range gun, you can use single dual pistols, you can use single heavy shotgun or single tac shotgun. The only guns that need a rework are the pump which now needs to get rid of the pullout delay and the pistols which are still a non factor mid to endgame.

For the first time in MONTHS I pick up whichever closed range gun I wanna play that game. I have games where I play single tac, I have games where I play single smg, yesterday I played smg + drum gun and sometimes I play single heavy or heavy + smg. The variety has never been this big and once pumps get rid of the pullout delay it will be even bigger.

Double shotgunning was a shitty mechanic, it just erased and skipped the weaknesses of guns. Shotgun + smg for example doesn't do that. You can't just ignore the downside of a pump (long time between shots) by just picking a second shotgun and having the same damage output of two pump shots in under a second. I don't understand how people don't get that switching from shotgun to smg is a whole different thing for balance and the meta than switching from shotgun to shotgun and skipping a downside.

They really need to get explosives fixed, they need to get rid of pumps pullout delay and pistols need a slight nerf. Then, I swear, the game will be in it's best state ever and I played since S1.


**tldr;** 

The meta is in a good and almost balanced state right now. Double shotguns are gone and should stay out of the game, smg's and shotguns are in a good spot except the pump, which needs to get rid of the pullout delay. Explosives need to get reverted to the capped ammo but old explosive radius.",FortNiteBR

Another huge factor in close combat, if you have full health and no-shield and are against a guy with full health full shield you will most likely lose, and vice versa.

Since it'll be only the people who actually fill it out it'll be a smaller sample size but it should provide some insight into your fellow redditors age range. I'm not condoning the ""everyone on here is 12!!"" or ""30 year old sweaty try hards"" statements, and the purpose isn't to validate anyone's perception. Just to get an understanding. I'm more curious at the end to aggregate all the data into age ranges plus playtime. See what age group is playing the most.

I can't provide an updating chart with age plus playtime info because every new response breaks the chart in google sheets, idk if there's a work around. I figure if this catches on, I can make one manually and update the entry above as time goes on.

There's no theme with the heroes to follow. There's no hero that can be defined as ""worlds collide"" so everything just feel like a skin made just for giggles. 

Drift and Ragnarok are two totally different entities.

There's no carbide vs omega theme here.
Which is fine. I love switching things up. But there should be se type of correlation!? Maybe one's from the future, one from the past and they have some untold link!?



Idk is it just me but the overall appeal of this season just isn't that high.

The guns the reworks etc...that on the other hand...is a welcome stay. The atk's, the smg's etc..etc..

That's all good.  ",FortNiteBR

They are the strongest and definitely the most used weapon right now in br. 99% of fights right now involve the smg, making it a weapon that you almost have to take just to compete. 

Considering that shotguns have been nerefed so badly recently, smgs need to be nerfed to make the meta balanced. The fact that the smg is so strong makes for less variety in people’s loadouts. Shotgun and smg is the only viable combination right now. 

The smg is quite overtuned at the moment and it is way to good. All I think needs to happen is a nerf to smgs dps and damage to structures. This way there will still be a way to compete against them while building and fighting against the spam they bring to the meta.

Also, I don’t want comments like “I hated shotguns so  smgs should be strong”, just friendly discussion. ",FortNiteBR

The SMG and drum gun are infinitely in basically ever facet. Even the grey silenced SMG outperforms the gold silenced pistol in almost every category


Simply buffing the damage or accuracy would allow the pistol to compete with these guns, but I think the better approach would be to carve out a more specific niche for our long forgotten sidearm.


My proposed change: **Give the pistol a x3 headshot damage modifier.** This gives the gun a clear strength; aim for headshots.


Will this push the pistol into the OP range? No. Hitting all headshots with a blue SMG does 546 DPS. Hitting all headshots with the gold pistol with this proposed change does 567 DPS. These numbers are comparable, and this is assuming you hit 100% headshots, which in a real game environment is unrealistic. Also remember, the gold pistol is a LEGENDARY gun. It should have clear strengths, and you should be excited to find and use it!


I think this change would not only make the pistol a viable gun again, but really fun to use. Landing a headshot would be even more satisfying, and you would feel like you're truly being rewarded for having good aim. It could also open up a more calculated, stealthy style of play with the silenced pistol (the silenced SMG doesn't really fill this niche right now, it's more suited to running and gunning). Perhaps when using a silenced pistol, crouched footsteps could be silent/quieter to really carve it out as a stealthy assassin gun? OK, maybe that would be too OP. But damn would it be fun.


What do you guys think? Good idea? Would it make the pistol too OP?",FortNiteBR

1. Change the rarity of it and make it an epic and make it much more harder to find. Maybe make the stink bomb rare (so there’s not too many epic throwables)

or 

2. Make it come in stacks of 2 instead of 4. Because 4 is WAY too much for what it does.

or

3. Make it do less structure damage so it doesn’t one-shot any type of structure. So basically you’ll need a lot more C4s to destroy buildings rather than just 2.

4. Make it travel slow in the air. (when the guy is throwing them)

or

5. They just simply vault it and work around with it.

That's not to mention that money was also being donated to charity, so it was a win win all around.

And then you guys came with your $8 mil and ruined everything, first you capped FF at $20k so they can't compete with your all mighty prize pool, then you guys announced that the $500k tournament will be hosted on Friday instead of the weekends, forcing FF to reschedule to the weekends, and finally you invited each and every single FF contestant... like literally FF was down to 5 players yesterday and they invited those guys too, forcing FF to cancel entirely.

You guys can go host your own tournaments, that's cool, but don't actively try to shit on other tournaments in the process just so you guys can always be on top... that's a really shitty business practice, its basically a monopoly. Epic doesn't just want a piece of the pie, they want the whole pie. Companies that do that are hated by everyone, just look at Comcast.

I was looking for a way to change my name and i know a lot of you guys want to change it too, so after i've done it yesterday i wanted to share the way with you guys aaaaand yes you will not loooooose anything ( skins, pickaxes , loading screen, level ....etc) 

- Soooo 1st thing you need to do is to create a new user ""psn"" on your console. "" be careful so you dont waste time"" you need to choose the name "" ID "" that you want to change from the older one to the new one in fortnite. 

-2nd : go to the website www.epicgames.com and log in with your epic account, after you log in click on your profile ( your name ) then click connected accounts , now you need to UNLINK your account from Playstation network,  click ""disconnect"".

- 3rd : when you click disconnect , a msg will pop up says : ""unlinck your playstation network from this account "" .... (dont be afraid lol you will not loose your stats or your skins) , mark all 4 options and then click ""unlink"" (  rate of your heart's beats is increasing i know i know lol )

- 4th : ( stay on the website ) now you need to link your epic account to the new ""psn"" you have just created on your console, you should click again on ""connect"" playstation network.

-5th : it gonna ask you to sing in to playstation network with  your email epic account  , just click "" link your account "" 

- 6th : confirmation msg : it will ask you to link your psn to your epic account , click """"""BACK """" ( cuz if you choose continue it will log in again to your old psn that you have and you need to re-do all steps from 2nd again ) 

7th : once you click """"BACK"""" the page will direct you to sony entertainement network , you need to log in with the email and password of the ""new psn"" that u made on your console. ( i repeatttttt : email and password of the new psn account u have created ) 


8th : when connect your epic account to your new playstation network , go to your console , log in to the new psn account , open fortnite , it gonna ask you for : sign up or log in ( first time playing fortnite ) , so choose ""log in"" after that , write your email of the new psn account and click "" one time password "". It will direct you to a new page : write again your email of new psn and click ""send password"".

9th : go and check your inbox email for the password that epic sent to you. And then type it in log in step on fortnite 

10th : enjoy playing with your new name. I'm glad i could help 10 or 100 or 10000 people lol. 

Btw , english is not my mother language , if anyone didnt understand any step i'll be glad to explain it to him/her again. Thank u ",FortNiteBR

Let me begin to put my thoughts across as to why this is TOTAL GARBAGE and makes the game easier for noobs (if they get lucky).

So even if you move right into the center of the circle, if the zone is moving outwards towards the enemy who's just hovering on the edge of the zone, he gets the chance to just build a fort, and camp you until you have to push.

Visa versa. But how is this a FAIR mechanic? There is nothing FAIR about relying on RNG to win at end game. The person who has to push is at a severe disadvantage to the person who gets to camp and just spam shoot as you try to build your way over to them before the zone comes and reks you.

The old mechanic was so much fairer, once you're in the final circle it would shrink into the middle, forcing both players to push, or first to the middle to be the one who gets to camp, everyone knew that. Now the game just relies on RNG to decide a winner (unless the guy camping is trash and you can push him with ease).

But let's face it any semi-decent player who gets the moving circle in their favor is not going to lose that fight.

GG Epic and making this game even worse and fucking things up for decent players yet again!",FortNiteBR

If you think im just bad at the game here are my stats https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/psn/Boiltheoil

a bad player can kill you so easily they just spam whether it be with a Drum gun, SMG, Minigun, Rocket launcher, Grenade launcher, C4, it burns through all my materials and it requires no skill.

Shotguns suck and are hardly worth picking up anymore (besides the Heavy). 

Splodes are bs right now, they use 1 rocket or C4 and all your building is gone, you need 1 brain cell to use a C4 or Rocket launcher and for it to have the impact that it does is ridiculous.

Changes I would make

Rocket launcher: No longer destroys buildings around the initial explosion

Grenade launcher: fire rate decreased to 0.85 from 1

Rockets: capacity increased to 20 from 12

C4: radius decreased by 200, now comes in stacks of 3

Silenced SMG: bloom slightly increased

Drum Gun: fire rate lowered to 8 from 9 

SMG: fire rate decreased to 12 from 13

Minigun: damage to structures lowered to 28/29 from 32/33 based on color, charge time slightly reduced.

Revolver: drop off damage reduced

Handcannon: drop off damage reduced

Scoped AR: Magazine size increased to 25 from 20, damage increased to 24/25 from 23/24 based on color

Pistol: magazine size increased to 20 from 16

Silenced pistol: magazine size increased to 20 from 16, fire rate increased to 7.5 from 6.75

Pump shotgun: No longer has switch delay, but still can't double shotgun, Damage increased to 90/95 from 80/85 based on color, number of pellets decreased to 6 from 10 (damage is the same), pellet size increased

Tactical shotgun Damage increased to 70/74/78 from 67/70/74, number of pellets lowered to 7 from 10 (damage is the same), pellet size increased

Heavy shotgun: pellet size lowered to 5 from 10 (damage is the same), pellet size increased

I want to take a look at how Riot has come up with a way to deal with the OG skins. I've been playing League of Legends since beta and since then a bunch of OG skins have been released, which haven't been seen in the shop since 2010. Recently Riot started rereleasing OG skins (Pax Sivir in this case), they made a new skin which is called Neo Pax Sivir, which is basically the same skin but it has a different splash art ([comparison of the splash art](https://imgur.com/a/3YIVBD6)) and is slightly changed up inagme ([ingame comparison of the skins](https://imgur.com/a/6c2dXcB)). Original owners of Pax Sivir also got Neo Pax Sivir for free.

I think the way they handled it can be translated into Fortnite. Take the Drift stages as an example, the last stage of it has a glow to it while the stage before that doesn't have one. It'd be the perfect way to rerelease OG skins in my opinion. Giving OG owners a glow to their skin won't leave them empty handed but it also gives new players a chance to get the skin they want.

* either the max shield value was 50 or the max hp were 150
* the pickaxe did more damage (cmon its a melee attack. it should atleast do 20 per swing imo)
* accuracy would drop further when jumping
these changes would minimize the frustration when you don't get the loot you wanted.  
Luck making things more difficult is normal. making it impossible at some cases are not.

The current shooting model has defined the game since release, plus they have made great step with introducing first shot accuracy and removing bloom entirely from the scoped rifle. However, I believe that there is some room for improvement. I should not hit someone 2 times in 15 shots when they are a solid 50% of my bloom and then the next game not get hit at all in 10 shots when I’m at least 50% of the opponents bloom. I’ve never seen a game that does not reward good aim quite like this, the bloom diamond is very large and is not hard to get on someone especially in medium to short range, so as long as you have thumbs it feels like you can keep up with people who have been playing FPS games for 10+ years. Not to mention Epic Games silence on the topic when it comes up on Twitter and Reddit is also somewhat frustrating from a player perspective especially with them pushing more and more for competitive play. Now I don’t want this post to be all complaining with no real discussion so I’d like to suggest a cone model in which we keep the same bloom diamond but have a higher percentage of bullets sticking around the middle and the percentage of bullets that land a certain place on the bloom diamond gets smaller and smaller as you leave the center. This would allow for the game to keep its current model without have to change much while also rewarding good aim much more than it is currently, which I believe is the best step for this game if it wants to go competitive.

Epic destroying Friday Fortnite is really sad. It was a good tournament style which was ruined when Epic stole all the player base and capped the prize money.","As it is shown in your previous attempts, you have no real solution to find a good balance between an e-sport and enjoyable content. As of today, Epic singlehanded destroyed Keemstar’s Friday Fortnite, a tournament which had some of Fortnite’s biggest names in content creators and comp players. This gained millions of unique viewers that would tune in for hours on that Friday. It also allowed third parties to try and perfect how Fortnite BR should be played competitively. Now, Epic holds their own poorly ran tournaments for absurd prize pools(instead of supporting these third parties or into servers to allow C4s and spectators) and not allow other tournaments to match that amount or surpass it. They have effectively put a monopoly on their game to be played competitively unless Epic has some sort of hand in them, which is wrong. 

TLDR:  Epic made a douche move and monopolized their game as an esport. If Epic prioritizes E-Sport advancement over money, they need to support these tournaments rather than cut them off and not let them flourish and allow Fortnite to grow as an e-sport.

First of all the staff are no where to be seen, Richard for example who was friendly at the Pro Shop, helped me get three strokes off my game. Was incredibly helpful and I hope he wasn't let go. Samson who worked the kitchen is no where to be seen HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO ENJOY A DURR BURGER WITH NO KITCHEN STAFF!!!!? There is no one at the bar or lifeguards at the pool. The facilities have gone down hill with **no running water** in the restrooms, shower or even at the water fountains. Your only beverages are locked behind vending machines that are either locked or asking for some reason that I pay in wood, brick or steel. 


Secondly I am finding much waste around the course from ***three packs of slurp****, **slurp coolers**, and EVEN **Slurp Kegs**. I am also finding dangerous **weapons, firecrackers and airsoft guns** laying throughout the course. Which is making me question whether you want my business or anyone of importance business. These youth that are running a muck are jumping around all of the buildings, driving the golf carts in a dangerous manner while possibly being under the influence of some type of substance, playing with firecrackers, airsoft guns, and running around with a large variety of weapons. They seem to think that Lazy Links is their personal playground building ramps, forts, and a variety of other structures. I am in constant fear while I try and play on this once beautiful course and I have not been able to play a full game without being rudely interrupted and I am starting to see that my business is not welcomed. These ***malicious, rude, bothersome, damaging, dangerous, destructive, harmful, ill-behaved, misbehaving, rascal, troublesome, vexatious, vicious*** individuals are turning this once wonderful golf course into a literal HELL hole. 


As a concerned golfer please look into fixing the management and make Lazy Links wonderful again.

Now, there's more to this than you may think. Pets would be used as an emote. They should have their own sound lines for being summoned, and making the sounds from time to time when they are out. They have a timer of how long they're out for. 5, 10 seconds.. or maybe even more.. idk.  

If your pet runs into an enemy pet, their timer gets forgotten about, and the two pets fight each other until one pet dies.. thus rewarding the winning pet pet XP.   

*What is pet XP used for?* Well I'm glad you asked.  

With your purchase of the seasonly battle pass, you get a free ***Battle Pets.*** A smaller battle pass, that your pet can level through, with pet XP and earn new sound lines, skins, etc.   

Ways to earn pets: Through the normal battle pass, after purchasing certain skins, you get a pet that goes along with it. e.g. Cuddle Team Leader: You get a smaller, Cuddle Team Leader.. Who wouldn't want a tiny pink bear running around with you? - Raven: Get a literal, pet raven. - Raptor: Literal, pet raptor. If you have any more skin, pet combos.. please let me know! And at the end of a ***Battle Pets***, you get a brand new pet.  

If by any chance, epic and pokemon team up, allowing pokemon pets.. they should totally be summoned by throwing a pokeball.   

There also should be an LTM where pets are out the entire game, as opposed to only being summoned.",FortNiteBR

The season 4 double pump is not OP.  The fact that the pump can't 1 tap anymore is validation enough to keep double pump how it was in season 4.  Of course double pumping itself was born from exploiting weapon switching, but it has clearly become a loved part of the game.

Now tell me this. How can swapping between two pump shotguns be any more op than spraying with an LMG or minigun, or, for the love of god, an smg.

The season 5 smgs are damn near just as op as season 1 double pumping, because it requires nothing more than aiming in the general direction and holding right trigger.  The new meta has become hold right trigger until the enemy has no mats left and then its gg.

Not to mention the pump now has equipment delay, AND swap delay with no ability to 1 tap.....jesus christ.  And sacrificing 2 inventory slots on top of that for double pumping.

All I'm saying is season 4 double pump, and double shotty in general, was where it should be, and it is so plainly obvious that EPIC is just trying to make the game more and more noob friendly, because there is no way building and manuevering while swapping back and fort between pumps and landing consistent shots is more op than spamming with an overpowered smg...

Bring back double shotty pls",FortNiteBR

Because I recently moved back home, I assumed it was my younger brother so I said nothing and left it. 

I noticed that my challenges were completing without me doing them and my skins were changing (I don't change my skins). On the release day of season 5, I had 2990 V-Bucks saved up ready to buy the basic Battle Pass and whatever legendary skin that comes out in the days that follow. However, I got home, downloaded the update and opened the game to find that the larger battle pass was purchased and any additional V-bucks were left were spent buying up more tiers and I ended up at tier 41 with progress on some of my battle pass challenges. 

I logged into epicgames.com to find my name had been changed, I had random people in my friends list and my location was changed to the Russian Federation. I then changed my password and enabled 2-factor authentication. The next day I got even more progress on my challenges

The last time I played Fortnite BR, I had 240 vbucks and was at tier 50

Today I logged on to find the “Sniper Eliminations” challenge already completed from battle pass and I had 40 v-bucks and was at tier 55. I work that out to be 1 tier from Elims challenge and 300 vbucks spent on two tiers. I checked my email, and saw two login attempts from IP addresses in Ukraine. 

So far Epics responses were seemingly copy and paste emails:

First Email: make sure you have 2FA when I’d already said I turned it on. 
Second email: receipts of my purchases but AFAIK in game skin purchases don’t have receipts.
Third email: They can’t refund vbucks and I’ve had no response since


I will accept the lost V-Bucks, but right now there is someone doing challenges I was looking forward to working on and completely ruining the battle pass for me. I’ve changed my passwords on both Xbox and Epic games to different passwords so there is absolutely nothing more I could do yet it’s still happening and I’m hearing nothing from Epic games since.

The only way to win is to camp and play the bush/behind trees. You play aggressive and all of your meds are gone by end game or you’ll be stuck with 5 hp frivolously searching for bandages. The only thing you can reasonably do to win is camp and wait until it’s you and the last person left and pray you can shoot him out of the sky or kill him before he notices you - which is practically impossible in itself

They always kill me immediately when they down me, even when my teammates are shooting at them.

They’re everywhere. I thought the skin was cool at first but everybody is using him so he’s become a little oversaturated

Is it me or are these guys the new rust lord? They’ll kill you with some rpg bullcrap and then emote on you

Whenever I kill someone from a distance in 50v50 they will go full seagull, like from Nemo. I’ve literally seen 5 of them run into bullet fire to pick shit up.

How can I improve?,"So I've been playing on my account for around three months now and since then I've grown to dislike solos, after losing over 1200+ games within the first month because I had no friends to play with and didn't understand the concept of ""building"" or gamesense, dying in each match within 1-5 minutes. Because of it, my overall stats are heavily skewed negatively. Since then, I've found a squad from my school which frequently plays, and currently in late season 4/early season 5 we've synergized to the point where we get frequent high winstreaks, an 11 winstreak max, 10+ kdr, and a 50%+ winrate each, but only for squads and duos. To this day, I cannot win solos. I get this feeling of pressure and anxiety when I'm in solos that I don't get in duos/squad that makes me make irrational decisions and cause me to choke by either pushing stupidly, thinking that the opponent is low and giving up the high ground in an attempt to get an easier kill then get killed, or getting sniped because I don't build higher walls behind me where a mountain is and someone can easily snipe my head while I'm fighting another person. I rarely lose build battles or AR spam (bc of peak abuse :D) and my snipes are pretty decent. Am I a bad player?? How can I improve??

I hoped that not a lot of people will land at Paradise and are doing some of the other challenges for the Battle Pass.

When I opened my glider, though, all I saw was half the lobby going the exact same place I'm going, and had a panic attack.

When I landed, there was literally a person in every corner of Paradise. I got jump scared like 10 times a game.

So in conclusion, I didn't expect so much people going to the same spot, even though I knew it was going to be crowded.

Why do you end game opposing players who are downed instead of preparing your next shot to save your team?

Assume that you don't need that downed players loot and they are actively trying to find you to shoot you. 

Is this because some players are just not very knowledgeable and go for the downed people because that's what you're supposed to do? Only thing i can think of.",FortNiteBR

Also you won't always be able to have a full squad or a dou partner and they would get bored also. What epic games needs to do is make more LMTs and have like 3 different ones a week all with the option  to do solos, dous, or squads. I think this would help keep people more interested in the game.

        They also need to fix some things such as phasing. The wrost thing is when you spend half the game farming for materials then someone keeps jumping through walls and floors also stairs. Also you shouldn't have to farm 600 wood for 10 minutes it should take half that time. Also explosives are way to op if you have 10 C4s you can destroy almost all of tilted towers. 

        Also they have to and they absolutely need to buff pump shotguns. I should be able to shoot a guy in the head with a pump shotgun and kill him with one shot. Also all shot guns should have more range and shoot farther about 40 meters. Also each shell should do a certain amount of damage per shot and have less of a drop off. 

        I know epic may not agree with this but I and I know may others would agree with me.

Because my friend and I love playing this game now however we're deaf. We're having a hard time communicating with each while playing in the game. I thought in-game squad chat would be great idea. It doesn't have to be 100 players chat, but I prefer it to be with squad only. It will increase our chance better of winning, if we spot the enemy so we would like to let each know where enemy is spotted and such as, and plan out our battle plan. The hearing players will always have an advantage over us by hearing but that's OK with us because it's like real life. We just need to communicate better. That's all we're asking for.

It might seem a bit pathetic, but I haven’t gotten a victory royale all season. The harder I try, the more hopeless it seems. Since there are only 4 days left in the season, I’ve entered something of a panic mode trying to get the victory royale. I know I’m going out on a limb here, but is anyone willing to get a win on my account. I don’t care much about my personal information, I just need someone who can get the win quickly and efficiently. I’ll probably do this on a first-come, first-serve basis, and all information will be given in DMs.

This is because of many factors, but in general just the abhorrent servers. It's gotten better with recent updates, but latency overhead (latency/ping due to server processing time) used to be 30ms + for me. This is still a problem in crowded servers or locations, and very noticeable at times in places like tilted or 50v50 game modes. 

The issue of hitting shots on your screen that deal little to no damage is due to ping so the lower the better. 

When shots in a slowmo clip seem to hit but don't, the person that takes less damage than they should have is almost always moving to the side or built just barely after the shot fired. Little damage is dealt in the moving scenario because according to the server, the player moving to the side is actually further along than he appears due to latency. It's also worth noting that the servers are a whopping 30 tick, which is ridiculous. The CSGO community cries for 128 tick when the servers are already over double Fortnite's impressive 30. I, however, don't know anything about Fortnite's load on servers or what they've done to optimize this so I can't complain, but that's why shots are fucking stupid sometimes. It's also worth noting that an update about 3 weeks ago upped the tickrate from 20 to 30, so that's a start. ",FortNiteBR

I bought Oblivion as I like it a lot more than Omega. I also wasn't able to play a lot this Season for the lights (was ill).

People are complaining about Oblivion not having lights, but I feel like the Level 80 grind was TOO much and people who earned it deserve it more than us.

But i think it's a smart and correct move on epics part to not allow the ability to change colors on virtually the same skin.. People worked hard and invested a lot of time to be able to have a unique variant of omega.. Last season  had everyone running around as John wick and by the end of it most of the worst players were actually John wicks. At least this season it's different.. If you pay money you should be rewarded.. But if you pay money and invest a lot of time you should be rewared even more. The unique customizable option is a good step. ,FortNiteBR

Now I've known this for longer but just now my second cousin's granddad did something that pissed me off, so I decided to reveal the company's season 5 plans. 
  So far there are 5 rifts around the map, slowly consuming locations, and a construction zone at tilted towers. The reason tilted towers will not be consumed is because it will become the heart of the map, and the construction zone will slowly be turned into the city hall. When the rest of the map is consumed, (very soon) it will be reconstructed, and will be finished by the beginning of Season V. The rest of the map will be turned into basically a large city, and the larger streets, parks, etc. being named locations. The season will be city/street themed and we will be seeing more street style outfits similar to ""Jumpshot and ""Teknique"". I wasn't informed much, the only specific location I'm sure of is a museum, which I'm guessing is related to the newly found anchor.

That's all I remember being told. I'm not supposed to say any of this but you can thank my douchebag second cousin's granddad.",FortNiteBR

The fact that having two+ clingers on a wall basically renders the wall useless doesn’t really make sense to me. If two clingers are thrown on a wall, the first one should detonate, the second one should start falling with enough time to actually place a wall (even with turbo build), and then the second one should detonate. 

In the game I just played, someone rushed me when I had just gotten out of a long build fight, so I was running out of mats. Anyways, the guy threw a clinger at my 1x1 and stood behind a wall, so I just held down turbo build to replace the wall that the clinger would destroy. However, about half a second before detonation, he threw another one at the same spot, so I just instantly died. 

I feel like clingers shouldn’t be able to penetrate through walls like that. And yeah, you could make the argument that it’s part of the game, but if that’s the case, they should be at least a little bit more rare than uncommon. ",FortNiteBR

Right from the spawn island, I'll either get 140-180 or 30-40 ping, at it will stay at that for the whole game. Sadly, I get one of those low ping games every 5 high ping ones. It's hard to describe, but it's like a pattern which has nothing to do with my internet connection, I have to play 5 140-180 ping games before I get a decent one(For reference, I get 30-40 ping stable on CSGO br servers, never goes higher than that). Since Epic no longer responds to tech related emails, I checked the forums and found that there were plenty of South American players having the same issue as me, but all their posts were ignored with no replies at all (besides from people stating they have the same issue).  
  
This is a very frustrating situation because I love this game but it just isn't fun to play it this way. I log in every day hoping it will be solved only to be dissapointed. I'm making this post hoping someone from Epic can see it and give me an answer because I'm sure there's plenty of people having the same issue as me, but the South American community just isn't very outspoken.

Now that's not to say that somebody can't grind to that level with those stipulations but it definitely makes it a challenge. To help out with this XP grinding, I suggest that Epic puts in a milestone page, where you can do certain in-game tasks such as getting eliminations, revives, eliminations with certain guns, and wins. I feel as though this would give some of the people who don't have all day and night to grind on the game a little extra help so that they can get to a certain level or unlockable style (again, if Epic even decides to add those next season.) I've attached a sheet that I've made representing what the page would look like and to give you a visual of what you would be doing to get XP. This was just a rough draft that I made off the top of my head so there's bound to be mistakes and faults. Please give any feedback.",FortNiteBR

To top tht all off you have the new rocket damage to structures and the overpowered c4. I feel like all these weapons are way to easy to use which will result in the better player losing a lot more frequently which shouldnt be the case in this game.

***Failed to install BattlEye Service""***

**I have tried:**

**1)** Deleting Battleye folder from Fortnite files and verifying the game file through launcher

**2)** Deleting Battleye folder in Common folder, it got deleted with ease (i don't have it anymore)

**3)** Updating Windows 10

**4)** White-listing all the EPIC GAMES folder in the antivirus

**5)** Updating everything that could be updated on the fucking laptop

**6)** Posting on [r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR) and [r/FORTnITE](https://www.reddit.com/r/FORTnITE) but got little to no help

**7)** Sending Fortnite support an Email this was their response

&gt;The Epic Games Support structure is changing to better accommodate the growing population of players. Direct Support is centered around account and purchasing issues. For issues associated with performance please visit the linked resource below: (with a link to the Hardware/Technical Support Forums)

WHICH IS FUCKING BULLSHIT, they basically said they care about ***MONEY*** and ***MORE PLAYERS***

**8)** Posting on the Hardware/Technical Support Forums and searched for people with similar issue, apparently like 10 other people had this, but none of their posts were answered nor solved (some where at 6 month and some from like fucking year ago)

**9)** Sending Fortnite Support again with the excuse it is account related but they sent me a automated email back... -\_-

# NOTHING WORKSSS

I have **3 Options LEFT** that I know of:

**1)** Reinstall the Game, BUT ARE WE GONNAA?? (ofc the fuck not, i cba, season 5 in like a week plus an update will probably come up in the next 2 days soooooo NO to much data will be wasted for just a small retarded fucking program that randomly breaks down for no reasonable fucking reason)

**2)** Reinstall Windows.... Which is a NO... I am not gonna do that... JUST BECAUSE A SMALL RETARDED FUCKING PROGRAM THAT RANDOMLY BREAKS DOWN FOR NO REASONABLE FUCKING REASON

**3)** Just Leave Fortnite (Most probably if i don't find another solution) especially after the Fortnite support caring only about ***MONEY*** and ***MORE PLAYERS***",FortNiteBR

The grind was really time-consuming more than anything, and I feel like I've achieved something getting this much xp in a season, and I have definitely improved as a player. However, the grinding to hit level 80 isn't so much a challenge as it is a time commitment. I would like to see skin challenges be like ""Get 1500 season kills"", ""Get 10 kills in one game"", ""Get 500 sniper/AR/shotgun kills"" or something to that effect. This likely would encourage more aggressive gameplay overall in Season 5 rather than promoting camping in a tree and gaining XP for survival time and placement like this season.

Essentially what I'm getting at is the evolving skins were a great idea and I hope they bring them back in S5, but I definitely feel like the challenges could be improved on to encourage players to get better, rather than play more. ",FortNiteBR

So here are things to be discussed more:

Pistols: What is the use of a pistol anymore? It had potential that was being buried by the Ar's and burst and the smg's are currently carving the headstone of their existence. The only do 1 more damage than the silenced smg's, are manual firing guns and have much less hitspeed than smg's. Please buff these.

Hand cannons: Also from the pistol category is the hand cannon. It does too small damage to be effective and with the dual pistols there is no use whatsoever to them. Also buff these. They are bad.

Pump shotguns: Ok these are actually talked about a lot but I think they could use a tiny buff. Maybe the blue could be 90 damage. Yes them being nerfed helped a ton to the playerbase but it would be good not to exile them.

Possible free skins in season 5 free pass: Now I know I sound greedy but I myself also own a battle pass like many so I'm not trying to benefit myself. I am just thinking of the old shop skins that are so bad they are basically no skin upgrades. Maybe one of those or even the og no skins from seasons 1 (I wasn't there but i saw photos).

Legendary smg: Yes I know they are dominating but it would be cool to have one. Pretty much every other gun category of weaponry has a legendary except for the smg (minigun does not count).

The drum gun: This may be my own unpopular opinion (unless of course everyone else thinks this) but why does the drum gun exist. It has a better magazine and damage than the subs. It has better damage and range. I'm pretty sure it is silenced. Why does it exist?",FortNiteBR

My friend has the exact same internet package, lives down the street, and uses a WIRELESS connection and still gets 30-40 ping. How is that even possible I really want to know.  Anyway, is there anything else I can do to get lower ping at all? It’s really holding me back competitively when you are trying to edit quickly and sometimes it doesn’t register until 4 seconds later and I can never retake high ground because of this so it is literally holding me back from being a decent player.

The part of gaming I enjoy most is learning new mechanics, challenging myself to do better and conquering my adversaries. With over 800 hours in PUBG, I was looking for a new way to challenge myself and the building mechanic in FN attracted me immediately.

I saw that there was a very low barrier to entry, but the skill ceiling was MASSIVELY high. I love these types of mechanics....anyone can jump in and execute them, but the boys are separated from the men via time, practice and mastery of a skill.

Needless to say, with a skill ceiling on this mechanic so high, the skill gaps from one player to another are unusually wide. I have been on both the giving and receiving end of this skill gap and I am writing this post to complain about the results of not matching like-skilled players together.

Most recently, I got a #2 game, and lost to a player who had 19 kills and was building AT&amp;T stadiums into the heavens with jump pads. I couldn't even process what he was doing, and the fact that me and this player are in the same lobby is, in my opinion, wrong and not in the spirit of good sportsmanship. I can not compete against him any more than I can compete against Gary Kasparaov in chess, so why are we playing the game together? From his end, he is shitting all over n00bs all day and is not getting challenged himself to be a better player.

If someone is trying to learn a new skill, let's say, swimming competitively, you do not start learning this skill by competing against Michael Phelps. You compete at smaller levels with people like you, which helps you hone and perfect your skill. Once you stop improving, you push yourself again by challenging the next bracket of players (think local competitions, then county, then city, then state, then country, then Olympics). This is called a ladder and the lack of one in FN is starting to discourage me.

It is exasperating to continue banging my head against a wall trying to figure out what I did wrong, or how I can improve when the people who are killing me are so advanced, I can't process what they're doing. 

To conclude, this game desperately either needs A) a ladder, like SC2 (bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master, grand master) or B) Needs SBMM to protect lower skilled players from being shit on by people who have already attained a mastery of the game.

Cheers.

Epic decided to nerf the double pump but there was a bug (or smth else, can't really remember) that let you still use double pump and epic decided to keep it like that. Long story short, double pump is a thing since a lot of time.

Dying to a double pump is the most disgusting thing in this game since it has no weaknesses (just build lol). Double pump really makes me not wanting to play this game anymore, and it's a shame because I really love the game, but can't play without finding people using this.

IMHO it should be completely removed, but how? Make it that if you switch from a pump to another pump it doesn't have delay so you can do 2 fast shots, but when you go back to the first pump it has that delay as when you using 1 pump. This will remove double pump spam without making it COMPLETELY USELESS. You can still use pump + tactical, but it's much more fair than double pump.

1. The Handcannon
2. Remote Explosives (C4s)

At least now if I have 200 hp and I out build somebody, i know they cant jump and headshot me for 200. 

Smgs and Pistols(silenced pistol and dual pistols)
I think the Smgs right now are in a pretty good spot. They are pretty strong in close range, but aren't overpowered. The silenced SMG is usually for taking pop shots from a distance to drop them off a mini shield or two. The dual pistols are also a balanced follow up to the pump as I feel like a two shot burst for 40 damage. The silenced pistol is another very strong pistol as it can snipe across the mountains for 20 damage.

What was the point of all that? Many people are upset the pump and maybe even double pump is dead and complaining epic is ruining the game when I feel like they are just changing up a stale and depressing meta to spice things up.",FortNiteBR

Only to lose all my wood in ONE build battle with another player who would've otherwise destroyed me if I didn't have the materials I had only to then get eliminated by someone with full mats who was waiting for the fight to be over to come get me when I've got nothing left.

This feels awful and honestly, I'm sticking to just playing Playgrounds for now until this is fixed.",FortNiteBR

1. How much time it took for you to realise building is important as much as aiming ?

2. How much kills are you getting per solo (average) and how much time it took for you to get there ?

3. Do you bait your your teammates to get kills ? 

4. What YouTube channel is best for tutorials only ? (Not funny montages or fails)

5. Why there are no stats available for 50vs50 :( ?

6. WHY DONT YOU PEOPLE RESPECT NOSKINS :P ?

7. Which game(s) you completely stopped playing  because of fornite ? (For me its csgo).

8. For how long this community will remain this friendly ?

9. Why EPIC employees are bae ?

10. Why do you keep your voice chat in 50vs 50 on ""always on"" if your mother is yelling, fan is on full swing and dog is barking ?

11. Why just why!!??

So here’s an update on more proof, following old leaks, and trying to figure out the Durr Burger phone number and Agent card.

First off, if you didn’t know, the huge Durr Burger found in the desert came with a Agent card. The Card had on the front side the words “Agent #Something”. I don’t remember the agents name exactly because I didn’t go into it.
But the back side of the card came with the phone number: (712)380-4091. 

**Lets get into the phone number:**

A lot of people assured the (712) was about a area code in Lowa (which it is), or it meant something about meteors in a small village. What I think it means is just the simple date for the next battlepass, July 12. 

Now what do 380-4091 mean?  Well I believe at they are directions. I narrowed it down to South Africa. 4091 is a postal record in Durban, and Durban has a airport A380 in it (also a 380 route going through it).

So what does this all mean and how did I piece together me coming conclusion? Well since I haven’t analyzed everything yet, (The agent) I resorted to Leaks. 

O I remember in an old and (probably) fake leak, I read about Indian Jones being the tier one skin. So I started to search up Indian Jones books and found out that his book called Indian Jones and the Sky Pirates takes place in Durban. So if the agent name or some other information comes up that we can link to Indian Jones, The Sky Pirates may be the next battlepass. 

Now I did tell you guys I believed in this now so here’s where I started to realize I may be right. There was a post about how the whole meteor thing with the area code (712) linked to the anchor pickaxe and cloud strike because they released when the meteor hit. Get it? Anchors and cloud strikes? And now the Viking anchor came out of the sky? Pirates in the Sky could refer to the huge crack in the sky and how Pirates are goin to come out.

The Durr Burger appeared in California at 15160 E Ave S, Llano, CA. The phone number handed out at the site gives you the location of Estherville, Iowa where a meteorite landed in 1879. The straight line distance is 1373 miles or 2,209.62km. Once I looked on a map the angle between Greasy Grove and Dusty Divot looks quite similar to the real life Durr Burger location in relation to Estherville.

     Using this [site](https://fortniteinsider.com/fortnite-map-time-distance-calculator/) I was able to approximate the distances between The Durr Burger in Greasy Grove to The Meteor in Dusty Divot (1026m) and The Meteor to The Tomatohead in Tomato Town (503m) Keep in mind these are just estimates.

So if there is a correlation with the appearance of the Durr Burger in relation to the rest of N.A. We have to determine what the scale would be using the 3 numbers we have. We compute it into an equation to solve for x (real life distance between Estherville and possible Tomatohead)

2,209.62km = 2,209,620m
2,209,620/1026 = x/503
2,153.626 (approximately) = x/503
2,153.626 * 503 = x
1,083,273.74m = x
1,083,273.74m = 1,083.27374km
1083.27374km = 673.115 miles

This means if the connection between Durr Burger and Estherville means something, The possible Tomatohead could be 673.115 miles Northeastish of Estherville.

Now to approximate the angle of Dusty Divot to Tomato Town. Since I’m a work and using only estimations, I used the same [site](https://fortniteinsider.com/fortnite-map-time-distance-calculator/) to calculate slope using Rise/Run.

Keep in mind these are just estimates of the distances in game.
The Rise = 455m
The Run = 152m
455/152 = 2.9934 which I will round out to 3
Using [this site (which may or may not be reliable)](http://www.greenbeltconsulting.com/articles/relationships.html) A slope of 3 on a graph correlated to 18 degrees on a compass/map

From eye estimates it looks like it could be somewhere in NW Ontario or possibly center of Ontario. 

TLDR: someone who is not proficient in math and grid/map reading should read this post and try to find a more exact location or disprove this theory.",FortNiteBR

I had already created an account using my xbox log in email. This meant I couldn't ""upgrade"" the headless account using that email because that email was already associated to another epic games account. 

Solution: I went into my microsoft account on my laptop. I added an email ""alias"" using one of my other gmail accounts. I made this second email the primary email for my microsoft account. I think ""upgraded"" / signed into epic games via my 2nd email, which successfully ""upgraded"" my headless account. I was then able to link my twitch to that epic account. I haven't confirmed the loot is there becuase I am at work, but it all makes sense that it should be. I will update when I can confirm the loot is there. I just wanted to get this out there ASAP because I know a lot of people are just as angry as I was lol. If someone else can confirm this works that'd be awesome.",FortNiteBR

* The quest isnt even qualified as Hard (Its a lot easier to do the hard quests and get 30 stars instead of this 5 star quest!!!)

The fuck? Pleasant Park quest at least kinda made sense because there were a lot of chests, but Wailing Woods?

Please change it to Lonely Lodge at least.

edit: many ppl try to defend this with ""you have 60 days to finish that"" ... stop defending awful decisions. the fact that i have a lot of time to complete this challenge does not change the fact that you need to land woods ~10 times and its not in par with other quests, in terms of time required. it's a terribly designed quest that should grant 10 stars at least.",FortNiteBR

41,coli_ha,1519901434,814fdb,15,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/814fdb/battle_pass_critique/,12,Battle Pass Critique,"My one biggest gripe with the Battle Pass is that all of the rewards can be instantly purchased on the first day of the season.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I feel that some rewards should be locked behind game play requirements that make seeing them in game/lobby actually special.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

I feel that an additional season reward, not necessarily linked to the Battle Pass, locked behind wins or kills would give some players a greater incentive to play the game and work towards a goal. Imagine seeing someone with a special skin or backpack that you know they earned by winning 100 games or getting 5,000 kills during the season?

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Right now there is no distinction between someone who spent $100 to buy the John Wick skin and someone who grinded for the same achievement. I feel that skill rewards would be a good addition to the current Battle Pass system that would make grinding during a season more special as well as feel better for the player.

I bought Battle Pass 2 &amp; 3 and now see that Amazon Prime members can get a free skin as well. I'm trying to link my Twitch account with my Epic Games account, but unfortunately I do not remember what my email is that I signed up with.

Is there anyway to view the email that I used for my account? I'm playing on Xbox One if that makes a difference.

You need 990 Battlepoints for LVL 100.

- There are 9 weeks and each week gives you 10 challenges which grant you 50 Battlepoints. The Last week is a bit shorter and only grants you 40.
- There's one Freepass-Mission which also grants you 50 Battlepoints.

Keeping that in mind, you can do 8*50+40+50=490 Battlepoints just by completing the Weekly-Missions.

- You get one daily-mission per day with the reward of 5 Battlepoints.
- The season is 68 days long.

Keeping that in mind, you can do 68*5=340 Battlepoints from the Daily missions.
Adding these 340 to the 490 from the Weekly-Missions, you receive a total of 830 Battlepoints.

Since Battlepass LVL 100 is 990 Battlepoints, there are still 100-830=170 Battlepoints missing.

- Each XP-Level gives you 2 Battlepoints, every 5th LVL gives you 5 and every 10th LVL gives you 10 points.
- So you get a total of 8*2+5+10=31 Battlepoints every ten level.

Keeping in mind that we still need 170 Battlepoints you need to get to Mission-LVL (170/31)*10=54 to reach Battlepass LVL 100.

- If you did buy the Season 2 pass, you get 5 LVLs from the beginning so you only need to get LVL ((170-(5×10)/31)*10=38.


CONCLUSION:

➡️If you didn't buy the Season 2 pass and do every possible mission till the last day of the season, you need to achieve XP-LVL 54.

➡️If you did buy the Season 2 pass and do every possible mission till the last day of the season, you need to achieve XP-LVL 38.

➡️If you don't do missions, let god help you.


Let me know what you think about my calculation and/or if I made any mistakes in the comments.

Edit: check out the comment from @Wylthor since I made some mistakes. You only need to get LVL 54 to get Battlepass-LVL 100.

Edit2: My calculation is now corrected! Thanks again to @Wylthor",FortNiteBR

3) Updated textures on the gas pumps to make them look more improved (the gold on them matches Jetpack aesthetic)

4) Added in lights to the pumps that glow yellow on the ceiling (my guess is the lights are an indicator of if there is fuel to use there)

I'll try my best to explain the details so it might be a bit verbose.

When you first start the game on your console (XB/PS4), your XBL/PSN account will be ""new"" to our system. You are prompted to create a new Epic Games account, login to an existing Epic Games account or to ""just play"".

If you select to skip the Epic Games account flows, we create what we call a ""headless"" account which will have your game profile.
Selecting to login with an existing account (or creating a new account) basically allows you to use your gamertag to login to that account. In other words, your XBL/PSN login is simply a means to authenticate you so we  can retrieve your Epic Games profile (whether it's headless or not). It's just another authentication method just like your email/password or even Facebook/Google if you play on PC in the Epic Games launcher.

Assuming you have a headless account, if you ""unlink"" your account (by contacting customer service or using the website's account management before it was temporarily disabled to avoid confusion), your profile is still associated with your Epic Games account. In other words, if you unlink your PSN and then try to boot the game in your PS4, to us, that PSN account is ""new"" (since we no longer have it associated in our system) and will not have any purchases/etc that you may have made before. Those purchases/items are still in your original profile which are accessible by using your email/password.

TL;DR: Your game profile is associated with your Epic Games account. XBL/PSN are simply methods of authentication we use to reach your Epic Games account.

PS. You cannot circunvent the platform lock we have in place. Due to current platform agreements, if you play on Xbox, you will not be able to use that account to use on PC/PS4. If you play on PS4/PC, you cannot use that account on Xbox. Do not try to use the linking/unlinking feature to circumvent that as it won't work.

PS2. If you already have a headless account (because you started playing on Xbox or PS4), don't create a new Epic Games account. Instead, just login to the website using your XBL/PSN credentials and you will be asked to enter an email/password to ""upgrade"" that headless account",FortNiteBR

I've been running the same load out since the game launched. 
An AR, Shotgun/RPG, and a Sniper with two inventory slots for healing. 

I've heard people say we should have a sixth inventory slot for grenades. This is a good idea when you think about it, but when put into practice there'd be too much explosive spam at the end of the game. People would just carry 10 frag grenades. So, what if this sixth inventory slot was for Healing Only. That way you could free up one of your inventory slots for whatever you want. 

A second shotgun, another healing item, some type of grenade, a Hand Cannon, a Silent Weapon, or maybe you want to carry a scar and a burst rifle depending on the situation.

In my opinion this would be the best option to allow for more types of gameplay and not limiting yourself to one healing item just so that you can carry 1 boogie bomb, or 3 impulse grenades.",FortNiteBR

However, what I consistently fail to understand is when I get into a fight with multiple people and down one of their guys, I usually leave them alive and focus on the other people around me but then when they get one of my guys down, they grieve him immediately ***in the middle of the fight***. So then I go back, and grieve their guy in the middle of the fight then get messaged at how much of a tool I am...? I really don't get it.

Now, I'm not sure if this is possible, but in I'd like to change the layout of the building menu on controller. Not for all controller layouts, just maybe a new one.

Stop me from fat fingering and building defensive roof tiles that do nothing

Make it so console players never need 3 inputs to make their desired cover, only 2 inputs would be required.

And finally, closer align the PC experience with the console experience, as they can set hotkeys for these things if need be.

Now you may ask, what about roof tiles? Well floor tiles work as roofs but with more freedom to engage anyways, and Many top tier players don't even have roofs bound at all on PC. As an aggressive player with over 100 wins, I'd like the ability to have the best possible chance at winning my 1v1's, and building quickly and efficiently is the answer. So yeah if anyone agrees with the console improvements I've put forth, I'd greatly appreciate an updoot for visibility. Thanks!",FortNiteBR

**1.** Login to your Twitch account

**3.** Go to the Connections tab

**4.** If your account is connected, ""Epic Games"" should show up under ""Other Connections"" at the bottom of the page

**5.** If you followed all steps above, be patient and your Twitch loot should be available in-game when they sort everything out

You also get an email if you successfully linked your account, but this is just another way to confirm since email can sometimes be unreliable.

*If you have an existing Amazon Prime membership, then you have Twitch Prime. As part of Twitch Prime you can unlock some awesome free loot as a subscriber.*   
&amp;nbsp;  
**How do I get it?**

*Head over to your Twitch account, go to your settings, hit the Twitch Prime tab and link away! Or navigate to the [Twitch Prime Page](https://twitch.amazon.com/prime) itself.*   
&amp;nbsp;  

**What’s this Twitch Prime / Fortnite Pack?**

*You can find out more info [here](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/twitch-prime-pack). Basically, you get some cool in-game Fortnite loot if you are a Twitch Prime subscriber.*   
&amp;nbsp;  
**I see the word free, but it still costs money?** 

*Yes, a Twitch Prime subscription is free with an Amazon Prime membership, but an Amazon Prime membership does cost money.* 
 
&amp;nbsp;  
**Do I get to keep the stuff?**

*Yup! And once claimed you’ll be able to glide into a match with your new Twitch Prime rewards*.
 
&amp;nbsp;  
**How long will I have to claim the goods?**

*You’ll have until May 2 to claim your Twitch Prime rewards, so grab ‘em while you can!*   
&amp;nbsp;    
**Can I redeem on my PC and use it when I play on PS4?**

*Yes, only if your Epic account was previously linked with your PS4 account, then you will receive the items on both.*  
 
&amp;nbsp;  
**REMEMBER** You must link your Twitch account to your Epic account to complete the redemption process, not just linking Amazon Prime to your Twitch account. Example: [Dev Flow](https://imgur.com/a/WjlHT) Make sure to claim the offer on Twitch after linking your Twitch and Epic accounts.

&amp;nbsp;  
EDIT: The issues have been resolved, link your accounts and redeem your reward!

It wouldn't deal damage to teammates, and the damage would stack up to nine damage per tick if you put three of them in the same spot. They would come in sets of three instead of five.

Imagine if Epic rewarded VBucks to BR players for getting a W or killing the most opponents.
Think Epic loses money on that route? Think again, if they kept the winnings small like say 25vbucks per win, that wouldn’t be enough to over saturate the market and people would put even more time into BR.... thus a smarter platform for Fortnite BR right?


People will still be interested in the quick but more expensive option sure however finally there would be a way you could still show off that your amazing player and not have to dish-out the hundreds of dollars just to look a certain way.

I could barely move, my health was in a critical condition. Having sent 5 evil doers to hell I was happy that I came to the critical moment of my life, it's a 2v1. 
I look down to my inventory, I'm delighted by the golden madness. I run up to the circle and I spot the enemy's fort on top of the Tomato Town tunnels and a furry teddy bear planning his attack to push the fort from beneath...
I quickly grab the silenced pistol and I subdue the teddy bear, to my surprise he drops the holy grail, also known as the Chug Jug, I quickly start drinking it and my health restores, my potential... unleashed!
I take the stairs and I prepare my attack. I place a floor, and a jump-pad on top of it. I jump. The biggest mistake of my life...

As soon as I jump a client from yesterday's meeting calls me, I can't let this go to voicemail, he know's I'm not working today... I take the call and the enemy spots me... He starts frantically shooting at me with his golden scar opening a wound so deep that it won't ever heal. My client notices the breaking of my voice as I see myself trough my monitor... dying. I was devastated. I ended the call.
I start spectating the winner... my heart, broke. He had 22HP and no shield... And as if it wasn't enough he starts rubbing it with his break-dancing moves, that I don't even have... making the deep wound deeper, opening it up to infections. It's a wound that won't ever SCAR.

Fairly new to the game.
I got the battle pass for season 3 and i'm currently level 30, tier 22. i do the daily challenges and out of the 7 weekly challenges and 7 level 2 challenges i have so far completed 10.
I'm not the best so if i only manage to do 5 out of the 7 weekly challenges and most of the daily challenges will that be enough to get me to tier 100?",FortNiteBR

[My lifetime stats](https://i.imgur.com/QvRHXWc.png)

95% of my Top finishes and my only Win come from when I was still new-ish to the game and from dropping around the edges. 

I really **do not** want to do that, tho. Dropping around the edges of the map, getting maybe 1 kill and sneaking into the Top 10... Boring and unsatisfying, especially as I always get outplayed (outgunned + outbuilt) in the climax of each game.

Repeated drops in Tilted Towers are just not working out. I'm trying to improve gunplay, I've rebinded keys for faster building and weapon switching, trying to be tactical in decision making... I've watched the streamers and try to do what they do, while simultanesouly trying to understand how/why it works.

But it is just damn hard and I feel like I am not improving at all. 10 games, 9 kills, with a lot of runs ending within seconds of landing as I just die. Going to Prison, Pleasant Park or w/e doesn't help either.

Is there any sureproof way to get better? I don't need to Win every other game, but I'd like to get, like, 5+ kills per game and get Top 10s...",FortNiteBR

The hand cannon for me feels just like a revolver with louder shot sounds. However the damage of hand cannons are not higher than the ones of revolvers ( about 75 for a normal hit, which gets outplayed by every smg, AR  etc. ). I would even prefer a blue revolver since the accuracy is pretty ok even on high range. 
So basically the hand cannon is a revolver which uses sniper ammo, but has a bad accuracy for its epic/legendary status. Even top players like ninja and myth are missing many shots with that weapon.

Stars needed to get to level 100: 990 stars


The total number of battle stars you can earn are broken down below.

Reaching season level 100 - 308 stars

69 ? Daily challenges x 5 stars each - 345 stars

Battle pass weekly challenges - 490 stars

5 free level (for season to owners) - 50 stars

Total possible stars - 1193

This is assuming you've already completed the daily challenges since the start of the season.

Unlike last season it seems like there isn't technically a date you must purchase the battle pass to reach level 100 (as long as you keep up with your daily challenges) but it will get more difficult to get the stars from leveling up to season level 100 as time goes on.

Hopefully this is helpful for some of you, please let me know of you spot any mistakes.

He was always very violent and angry around the house, and even at his special ed school. Then one day, I let him play fortnite on my console. He instantly lit up and started smiling. Becoming almost a sort of addiction, he played everyday for hours on end. His attitude became better, his outbursts occurring less often. Although he sometimes wakes up in the night, grabbing a steel pickaxe and running around the house naked while slashing our parents with it, and screaming ""Give me your loot, give me your loot!"" 

So in conclusion, our family has greatly benefited from Fortnite!

Been trying to run around and into fights more, build structures, build up to houses I know people are in to get the jump on them and generally have been a lot more aggressive and getting better. I have like 600 matches but can't win and now that I have been in 3 fights in the past day that have came to a small circle with one other person and they always just seem to be so much better at building or have a better view. What else can I do? Now that I'm getting so close and still failing it's even more frustrating than when I was just getting top 10 or 20. Also, I open a ton of ammo boxes and hack a bunch of stuff, kill 2 or 3 people in the match, and I just never seem to have these unlimited numbers of materials and ammo people have at end game. Do I need to kill even more people or be doing something else with my time management?",FortNiteBR

You can't double pump at all because the delay between two pumps is there even if the second shotgun is cocked. Sometimes switching causes the pump to actually break, making it so you can't shoot until you reload. This is on Xbox one. I'm not sure how to replicate the shooting glitch, but if you try double pumping it feels about the same as using a single pump shotgun. ",FortNiteBR

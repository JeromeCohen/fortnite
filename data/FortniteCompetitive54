Why is getting 2nd place not better than 3rd? Why is your 4th kill and your 6th kill completely irrelevant?

However even now I sometimes pick up a green/blue silenced over the drum just because your aim will be rewarded and your shots will land.

 I even sometimes run both a drum and a silenced but that comes with the cost of losing range.

But what I do know or what I've at least experienced in the last couple weeks, is that the silenced is way better than the normal SMG when it comes to versatility and bloom. 

Opinions?

All of my friends that play Fortnite and aren't very good always pick up the sniper and talk about how good a sniper they are, they're trash at building and would easily lose to a good player, but hitting snipes makes them feel good. 

I feel like it doesn't take enough skill to hit snipes and its way to easy to use. When I pick up a sniper it just feels unfair when I kill someone, id much prefer to build fight them and get a legit fight going I don't even use them in my inventory which leaves me a open slot for more heals or a fun gun like the revolver or deagle. It promotes a passive play style as well and makes the game unfun. 

Id love to see a mode without snipers, where real gun and build skill is put to the test. 

I know im going to be flamed but can care less, i feel like it takes absolutely no skill to snipe, obviously it takes skill to consistently hit your shots, but any potatoe can hit a lucky 200m + snipe while someone is jumping. I get sniped pretty frequently and it feels like a unfair way to die, ill be buildfighting someone and some potatoe with 0 kills hits a lucky snipe on me, it happens way to frequently.

What do you guys think?

For example, prepatch hitting someone at 50 shield and 100 hp for 100 dmg would show up as 50 blue and 50 white.  Now it just shows up as 100 blue.

I really hate this change and I feel like I never know how low someone is if I hit them with a shotty.  I'm not sure if this is what epics wants but it's really annoying to hit all blue and then die and see they only had 10hp left.  Not knowing whether someone is at low hp or 100 hp is really annoying and I wish they would change it back.  It's doubly annoying if they have a slurp running which makes it look like they have infinite shield.  Thoughts on the change? Is there some other reason Epic did this that I'm not seeing?",FortniteCompetitive

It involved binding your place building bind to scroll wheel down/up, then, simply scroll when you want to build, easily over 20CPS. 

Makes it terrible easy to do certain strats, like placing a ramp+bounce-pad when falling, and turtling...

It will require an ""infinite""/free scroll wheel, a feature on mice like the G502, and the G903.

In a time where potential damage windows to players can be extremely short, I feel as if high damage hitscan weapons really counteract the meta. A potential 150 headshot, or even 75 body shot with a purple deag can be so crucial to switching out to a shotgun and winning a fight. Oftentimes there is only one opportunity to get a shot off, and I think people are making a mistake by not running the deagle. Since the revolver is being vaulted, I'm honestly quite nervous they will vault deagle, and my favorite weapon in possibly any game ever will be removed. Please give it a shot and try and focus on first shot accuracy. The deagle really has potential to shine if used correctly.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic will be kicking things off with three Stage one heats every day, running Friday to Sunday. These will be open to the first players to register on site each day. Each heat will play a mini-series of two matches to determine placements. The top 32 players at the end of each Heat will move on the the Stage Two Nightly Qualifier for that same date.

Each evening, the Stage Two: Nightly Qualifiers will begin for all the players who advanced from that day’s Heats. The top 33 players at the end of the Nightly Qualifier will advance to Monday’s Stage Three Grand Finals.

During the Grand Finals, all players who qualified during each evening’s Nightly Qualifiers will come together in a series of matches. By the end of the six match brawl, the ultimate victor of the PAX Summer Skirmish will be Royale-ly crowned!

Disclaimer: Take this tournament with a grain of salt as the peripherals are completely changed up from what we’ve seen pro players rocking in the past. 

That being said, there were a ton of players who performed well and some who underperformed. 

Top Performers: Liquid 72HRS, Nate Hill, Turkey Lips. 


I mean cmon, the composure that Tom had to have in that scenario proves his worth as a top player in the game. Winning the final qualifer with ease, Tom got most of his points playing for  placement and finding his eliminations in the final 3 circles. 

Nate Hill showed up once again and had a solid performance. He earned all of his points in one single game, but in that game he went crazy, ending with a 2nd place to go along with 7 Kills. His close quarter engaugements were where he found most of his eliminations. 

Turkey Lips slayed out, and found most of his points through eliminations. He had good positioning and found most of his eliminations picking off people who were rotating late. 



Biggest Letdowns: Notvivid, NRG Zayt, NRG Kaysid, Ghost Dmo, Faze Jaomock, Faze Tennp0. 

Im not going to do an individual rundown of each player here, but what I will say is don’t overreact to this. All of these players didnt play on their preferred setups and are all incredible players. 

Im not sure 100%, but from what Ive been seeing, it seems like the players who didnt qualify in the initial heats (Kaysid, Jao, and Tennp0) get another chance to register for the heats tommorow, whereas Vivid, Zayt, and Dmo dont get that opportunity because they lost in the final qualifers. Again this is not 100%, but from what ive been hearing, that is the general consensus. If that is the case, I find that to be extremely backwards logic. ",FortniteCompetitive

I’m just getting into taking the game seriously on a competitive level. Been spamming squad scrims on FNPL with my team and we’ve been doing ok. However, I’ve noticed in fights and other parts of the game, we tend to just run around yelling things at each other and hoping we win our individual 1v1’s against the other team. This usually ends up with 1 or 2 of us dying, leaving 2-3 of us to carry out the rest of the game.
Now I’m simply wondering if there are any defined “roles” in squads comp play. 

Things such as a support, or a slayer (someone who’s main focus is to drop kills/play aggressive against the enemy team) or someone who’s mainly goal is to carry all the explosives/minigun to break other team’s builds.

Any answers are much appreciated :)",FortniteCompetitive

Obviously in the very very early game, you can get killed by someone with a double barrel while you have a pistol, but after looting one house, it seems that the better player wins out most of the time. I love the fact that it removes a large portion of RNG (no longer do I get killed by someone with a SCAR while I have a grey AR and grey tac shotgun). Everyone is on a level playing field with weapons. After the first ~90 seconds. 

On top of this, the SMGs being gone (or in the case of P90, incredibly hard to find) raises the skill ceiling of building much higher. The “hold left click to win” strategy does not work, with the exception of the minigun which is still easily countered, and rarely used in this game mode. ",FortniteCompetitive

We here are with the Eight and final week of Epic's NA Summer Skirmish!

---
Epic will be kicking things off with three Stage one heats every day, running Friday to Sunday. These will be open to the first players to register on site each day. Each heat will play a mini-series of two matches to determine placements. The top 32 players at the end of each Heat will move on the the Stage Two Nightly Qualifier for that same date.

Each evening, the Stage Two: Nightly Qualifiers will begin for all the players who advanced from that day’s Heats. The top 33 players at the end of the Nightly Qualifier will advance to Monday’s Stage Three Grand Finals.

During the Grand Finals, all players who qualified during each evening’s Nightly Qualifiers will come together in a series of matches. By the end of the six match brawl, the ultimate victor of the PAX Summer Skirmish will be Royale-ly crowned!


&amp;nbsp;

---

#Format: 

The final Summer Skirmish competition will be a 3-Stage Solo event held Friday to Monday. At each Stage, players will earn points based on the following scoring system:


- Victory Royale: +3 Points

- 2nd-3rd Place: +2 Points

- 4th-10th Place: +1 Point

- 3-4 Eliminations: +1 Point*

- 5-6 Eliminations: +2 Point*

- 7+ Eliminations: +3 Point*

*These points can only be earned once per match. For example, 10 eliminations would only earn you +3 points and any additional eliminations will not add points to your score.

Or is it going to be a place where people discuss their favorite streamers with a bunch of random questions asking about streams. Recently I've notice a lot of posts show up that are posts that wouldn't even make it onto the fortnitebr subreddit.

I want you to take a look at this post from another competitive subreddit and identify the differences https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveHS/comments/9bsxho/corpse_shudder_shaman_from_rank_4_to_top_1000 

It is someone who clearly has proven themselves to be a competitive player, it is a long post that is extremely insightful into their thoughts around the list. 

Competitive players are pushed away from this subreddit because a lot of people on this subreddit don't even talk competitively about fortnite. They are just here to talk about streams and streamers.

Even questions like how do I win more probably shouldnt even be making it here. If this is really a competitive subreddit. At the base level posters should be players with the ability to win and making posts to get players better as a whole. If you look at new right now there are 3 posts asking about pax time. How do these even make it through automoderation?

This subreddit shouldn't go the direction of /r/fortnitestreamercirclejerk but that's the way its going. I guarantee during pax people will post about the production and commentary on here. Why though? That's not competitive, that's not adding anything. Don't let /r/fortnitecompetitive be a refuge for kids who's posts get auto blocked on /r/FortNiteBR.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

Each smg should be special for a different scenario, but the drum gun works in all scenarios so why even bother with other smgs? 

&amp;#x200B;

The Drum does more damage than a P90, has more range, more ammo, and destroys structures faster. The drum is a weapon of green and blue rarity.

The drum gun has more range than a suppressor smg, the suppressor smg shoots slower and deals less damage than the drum gun, makes absolutely no sense.

&amp;#x200B;

The drum gun requires NO SKILL at all to use, you just jump and spam it, easy. Drum gun has 50 bullets, it takes 4 headshots to kill someone, which are incredibly easy to land because of the accuracy of this weapon.

&amp;#x200B;

This weapon is the gun that is always used to destroy structures. I played some gold mode and the drum is not there, people actually BUILD because they cannot spray you down as fast as the drum can, it requires more skill to win.

&amp;#x200B;

I been winning so many solo gold mode because it actually requires skill, when i do solos all people are doing is spamming their drum guns to knock my structure down.

I feel a good nerf to it would be to reduce its magazine, or to reduce its range, or maybe both.",FortniteCompetitive

The sticks feel too long, and while the analog triggers are great for racing games, I find them terrible for shooters compared to the digital triggers on the Switch Pro controller. 

I've been thinking about getting a Scuf as I like the idea of being able to jump or build without taking my thumbs off the sticks, and all the top-tier controller players like Nickmercs seem to use one, but they are crazy expensive, as is the Xbox elite controller. On a Scuf I'd have an option of using shorter sticks, too, which might suit my hands better and feel more like the Switch controller. My other option would be scrimming on my laptop, and plugging my Switch controller into my laptop. That way I could scrim with the controller I like to use. But honestly I'm intimidated by the idea of playing with a controller against keyboard and mouse players especially in a scrims environment.

I feel like this would be good for when the enemy ramps over your head when you are almost at the top of your ramp and you want to get a quick surprise shotgun shot on them. The downside is it doesn't get you much extra height, but you can easily turn and build 2 walls on the side of the new ramp and then ramp up to those walls, or if the enemy boxes themselves in after you take a shot or you don't have a shot, you can just go into doing a 180 turnaround or 90 degree turn arounds.",FortniteCompetitive

Format - Solo Squad","I'm probably getting to play in my first tournament tomorrow. It is hosted by small streamer from Finland and the prize is 2800 V-Bucks.

The format is solo - squad, but like friday fortnite style. 3 players and one judge in each squad. The 3 players are competing for kills and who got most combined in 2 matches moves to finals. 

I feel like i'm overall pretty good player (Epic game name: Thunedd), but today i switched to much higher sensitivity and started playing claw wich makes me pretty frustrated since i'm not really comfortable with my sens, but that's not why i made this post.

The reason why i made this post is to ask where should i land. I have no idea how good my opponents will be, i know there will be many 1-2 K/D players wich are most likely gonna be pretty easy opponents, but i don't know how good the best players will be so i need to play carefully.

I can try different landings and rotations, if you know any good ones let me know so i can try them out. I'm probably not going Tilted, maybe more like semi safe routes would be better. There still needs to be teams i can third party or spot from far and choose to take or not to take fight. I definetly don't want to be in open field 1v4 situation wich makes me feel like i shouldn't drop extra safe either, early game kills can be really important too.

I'm aiming for ATLEAST 7-8 kills average in a match. You can suggest different landing spots and rotations so i can try them out. Share your tips aswell :)

Remember: I'm not as comfortable with new sens and controller grip.

It wasn't viable to take an SMG because when you can one pump people you pretty much needed to have one for close combat.  This massively increased RNG influence in early game, when not getting one of these items made it tough to survive.

Now, nearly every gun in the game is used in games except pistols (hopefully these are buffed at some point to further improve the balancing). Splodes seem nicely balanced now with the rocket limit and decreased C4 damage..etc. I agree to some extent that pumps need buffed, but hardly; also I do believe tommy guns need a serious rework being green/blue or just vaulted.  I understand that countering spam from multiple SMGs/minigun is nearly impossible, but having no way out of a situation where you're alone and very close to multiple players is something that can be in the game if everything else stays as balanced.

The problem I have is that these weapons are too rewarding for body shots, no sniper rifle in the game should do over 150 damage and make you worry about being body shotted for an instant death. No shotgun in the game should insta KO with BODY shots from 200 shield, it reduces the gun-play skill-gap in a way where as before you actually needed aim to hit head-shots for any meaningful damage.

However, with the season ending soon we will likely see an end to rifts.  But don’t fret, as I believe epic has the perfect replacement for map mobility.

The bunker in Wailing Woods.  It appears to be a passage underground, but no one really knows.  This has been a mystery since season 4, though I don’t think it will be for too much longer.

The giant cube.  Showed up “randomly” in front of Ninja during the Skirmish between Fatal and the desert gas station and has been rolling north for a few days.  Many, if not most, think it will make its way to Loot Lake (a bane of rotation for too long) and blow it up.  I think this theory holds good possibility, but I think it will do much more.

My theory is that the cube will indeed make its way to Loot Lake but will sink in the water and expand underground creating a network of underground tunnels around the map.  In them some type of pad that would propel you from one entrance to another.  One likely extending from the Wailing bunker to the newly exposed underground of Tomato Temple.

What kind of impact can the management have on the direction of a player's stream?

221,Parenegade,1535567755,9bby18,21,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9bby18/unpopular_opinion_shotguns_shouldnt_dominate_the/,0,Unpopular Opinion: Shotguns shouldn't dominate the meta.,"Ok, I know most people in the competitive community loves shotguns. As a result, many don't like rapid fire weapons (aka the ""spam meta""). So people want Shotguns buffed and rapid-fire weapons nerfed. Many want shotguns buffed to the point that they can one shot people.

Here's the thing I really don't think that's going to make for a ""balanced"" game. If you nerf the Drum Gun and other rapid-fire weapons and buff the shotgun to that level it just means shotguns will dominate and no one will use anything else. That's not what we need. **I really believe Fortnite needs a consistent, high skill, accuracy based alternative to shotguns.** 

I don't mean fucking around with dual pistols in gold squads. I mean a real fuckin alternative. In Destiny (which is usually awfully balanced) the alternative to the Shotgun is the Fusion Rifle. It's a charge based weapon that 1 shots at little higher than shotgun range. It promotes diversity and I feel like Fortnite needs that too. We don't even need new weapons, Epic just needs to rebalance either the Suppressed Pistol or the Dual Pistols to challenge Shotguns in that space.

Once you have multiple options at close range then the game will be in a much healthier place and balancing shotguns will be easier. Swapping OP Drums Guns for OP Shotguns isn't the answer. Increasing the damage of the shotguns (without one shotting) and then reaccessing the various alternatives shotguns is the **much** better option.

An issue with a ranked system is that there's a lot of risk that's put on the table. ""I just farmed all this material and got all this loot, do I really want to risk it by fighting this guy who I know is around the same level as me in terms of skill, instead of just getting into the circle and taking it from there, is it really worth it?

In essence, I feel like the risks have to be lowered in order for a competitive que to be implemented, whether it be a second life,  increased loot or farm (so that it doesn't feel as rewarding as it is). Then again, we reach the conflict of evaluation, why shouldn't I feel rewarded for getting a golden scar? In contrast to this, if you've taken look at the new game mode then you might have noticed that you don't really give a crap about who you run into because you know you two share similar loot, thus the skill differences do not matter. 

However another reason to this might have to do with the fact that it doesn't affect your stats, which is another controversial topic that hasn't been brought up too often. 

I am not saying that I support ranked que, nor am I saying that I do. All I'm trying to do here Is paint a bigger picture and hope that people will provide with their own point of views, which is what this subreddit was made for.

It sounds a lot like Poach is getting a big impression of console players by Nicks playstyle which is unfortunate for us console players once again.

I understand a lot of people like Nick for his I.Q and his ability for high kill games, but he doesn’t have the play style of the above average console player.

He plays a default sensitivity (the reason for his accuracy) and he prefers a tactical over a pump to sit and hold right trigger shooting at somebody.

We use high sens, we use pump/drum over tac (most times), we build, we overall move much faster and make console players look much better in the eyes of PC players. 

This is coming from a player who plays console scrims daily with sweaty leaderboard chasers so brother I promise I know what a good console player looks like.

I just spent a couple minutes answering a question I've been asked on how to get better... I immediately responded with training your building skillset, as establishing high ground is essential for winning your engagements. The 5 minute video on which I talk about this is [HERE](https://youtu.be/hnlj7mIml0M) but if you don't have time to watch, here's a summary:

------------------------------------------//

--&gt; Building is essential

--&gt; Building THEN shooting

--&gt; DON'T drop down just to take a 50/50 shotgun brawl -- use your high ground advantage!

--&gt; Maintaining a 3-level height advantage is ideal. Keep this distance!

--&gt; Discussing ADVANTAGES of having high ground!

--&gt; Various other tips to using high ground in the best way possible... BUT SEE BELOW!

But guys... I want to hear your thoughts too! Feel free to give me your input, I want to start this discussion because I want to learn things as well and I think it would prove valuable to the subreddit, any thoughts on playing high ground (or even low ground) better is welcome!

My opinion:

1. Vertical Audio Fixes
2. Controller Freedom
3. Drum Gun Nerf

A vertical audio fix would make this game 1000% better. Players shouldn’t have to guess if someone is above or below them, the sound queues should tell us exactly where that player is.

Quick edits and hot keys would make gaming on console and with a controller in general so much smoother and more enjoyable helping eliminate the skill gap between PC and console. 

The drum gun is everyone’s crutch right now. It takes little skill to use and destroys both players and structures with ease. Nerf it or bring double shotgun back to balance out the OP drum gun and the game will be much better. ",FortniteCompetitive

I'm very comfortable with basic building and combat mechanics and honestly feel like the road to improving for me right now is landing safe, farming mats, and playing an aggressive mid and late game.

I think doing this increases my chances of running into good players who I will be able to have build fights with and eventually get better.

What you didn't see on the main stream was that Chap and Thieves saw Nate get the kills and immediately jump padded on him. They were also discussing finding the other top teams and trying to figure out which ones were still alive.

After the tournament ended, Chap was playing with Avxry and he told him that he sabotaged Nate Hill. He also said that he was pretty pissed when he was sabotaged week 2 or 3 by 100T (Think it was Kennith?).

You had to rate some of the following questions. What are your thoughts on the effect/side effects of changes to these things to competitive and pub games?

1. First Shot Accuracy is GOOD for Fortnite Battle Royale
2. Not having skill based matchmaking is GOOD for Fortnite Battle Royale (e.g. new players can be in the same game with experienced players)
3. Fall damage is GOOD for Fortnite Battle Royale (e.g. that if you fall from certain heights you take damage)
4. Item/Weapon variety is GOOD for Fortnite Battle Royale (e.g. the introduction of new items and weapons)
5. Traps are GOOD for Fortnite Battle Royale
6. Weapon Bloom is is GOOD for Fortnite Battle Royale

My thoughts:
1. For myself I'd love more 1st shot accuracy, but not sure if it would get me lasered more often and lead to more turtling. 
2. I wouldn't mind like 2-3 tiers of skill-based matchmaking. It would be better for newer players to learn the game. 
3. I think too many people would be skybasing without fall damage. And would lead to more turtling. I would be curious to see a LTM without fall damage though,without jetpacks. 
6. Not sure if it is exactly related to #1. But my thoughts are the same. Since it is a free for all, then hiding and turtling would increase a lot and it would be a lot easier to die. ",FortniteCompetitive

That being said, I am looking to increase my KD (shocker, I know) I'm aware most peoples advice for this would be very cookie cutter ie: land in populated areas, be aggressive etc. but I am looking for smart locations to get a decent amount of engagements every game, as many 1v1s as possible while being able to loot. My favorite locations to land are currently **Haunted Hills / Lucky Landing** I will land there 90% of the time, whichever side is the hot drop, I know my rotations fairly well and those games typically go my way.

&amp;#x200B;

I am by no means a professional player as I have much to learn and still make endless mistakes in pub matches, I'm debating whether I am ready for scrims or not and maybe someone could enlighten me on that as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The advice I'm looking for is landing spots / rotations that are **safe** but still give a decent amount of engagements through out the game (Dropping tilted isn't what I'm looking for) If someone could explain to me where they land, where they rotate, and their KD as reference I would love that, I think my landing and rotations are affecting my KD and kind of capping it in some sense.

313,Treecio,1535428299,9avohw,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/9avohw/shot_calling/,5,Shot calling,"How can I become better at shot calling?

Whenever I’m in a duo or squad game I tend to be the one who makes the most choices and try to lead us to victory. However, after just placing 2nd in 4/5 games I’m trying to figure out exactly what I could be doing differently or better. 

I always find myself to be in 2v1’s or 4v1’s because my teammates get into bad positions or they can’t hang on long enough for somebody to get to them. I’m not saying I can 1v99 the whole lobby but I can stay up most of the time till a teammate gets a flank. Should I be forcing myself into the more difficult spots so that maybe I have a better chance of handling a situation or am I going about it all wrong? 

We play aggressively when we need to and skip fights when we need to. We always play for circle and usually have no problem getting down to the last team or two. I’m always reminding the team to stay high in fights even when it’s tempting to drop and make it a 50/50 CQC battle. I try to watch some team liquid and some cloakzy to try and see how they’re so successful with their games and I try to incorporate it. It is a little frustrating coming in 2nd. It always feels like as soon as I get knocked or eliminated, the team can’t perform or clutch it out. 

Example: 3 v 2 situation outside titled river and we have zone to our right. I know that the two just got done fighting and are probably weak but why risk it when we can play zone and pick them off from a distance? One teammate of mine bulldozes over there and gets knocked, now it’s 2v2. I know storm is on the otherwise of both of us and I tell my teammate to launch out with me. Of course he’s not paying attention to storm and gets knocked as well. 2v1. Luckily this particular one I got the clutch but it’s frustrating to have to always to be in this situation because even though I know I have the ability to close it out I don’t always get to. 

I don’t wanna get new teammates cause when they’re hot they’re beasts. I just need to know how I can be a better leader and shot caller in order to maximize the chances of a dub. ",FortniteCompetitive

I can say with certainty that there are 3 serious orgs that he is/was considering. Team Liquid, TSM, and 100 Thieves. 

I’m going to attempt to provide edivence both for and against each org. 

**Team Liquid**

Pros- Vivid has played with Poach in week 5 summer skirmish and they instantly appeared to be a power duo, winning the tourney with ease. Vivid has said on multiple occasions that he thinks Chap is one of the best players in the game and they have played together multiple times. In MonsterDFace’s podcast with Vivid, TwoLoud and MonsterDFace asked Vivid what he wanted in an org and he replied, popularity to grow his brand, chemistry, and competition at the highest level. TwoLoud then hinted at the possibility of Liquid and Vivid seemed to give off energy as if he had already joined them. It was very interesting. Liquid are also known to pay very well for an org and they are currently an undisputed top 3 pro team. 

Cons- Liquid has an incredible 4 man roster already of Poach, 72, Chap, and Strafe. Many people were implying that Strafe would be benched for Vivid, but I just don’t see that happening. Poach, Chap, and Strafe have been playing together for years. 

**TSM**  

Pros-

Vivid has been duoing with Myth quite a bit recently and he seems to be enjoying it. TSM needs a 4th man on their roster and being one of the most popular teams in esports, this could be a power move for vivid and his brand. TSM also recently followed Vivid on Twitter.

Cons- Vivid made it clear that he wants to be on a highly competitive team and that he wants a team that can put him in the best spot to win. Surely he has seen TSMs performances in the summer skirmish, so I question whether he would ignore that or keep it in the back of his mind. 

**100T**

Pros- Vivid has been playing duo scrims with Parallax recently and they seem to be the team no one is talking about. They have a good roster of Kenith, Parallax, and Risker and getting Vivid could put them in contention for the best fortnite team. Vivid also said that he was flown out by an org to LA, and it just so happens to be that the whole 100T team was in LA at the time. 

Cons- 100T has been a sleeper prediction for a while because well... he hasnt really talked about them nor given any hints that he is considering them. From what hes shown on stream, 100T has the least amount of chemistry with him of any org listed.

Conclusion: I predict that Vivid will announce and sign with TSM. Vivid announced that he will reveal his org tommorow! What do you guys think? Let me know in the comments.

I didnt make this post with the intention of making anyone mad. There are no content creators/streamers on this list.

Criteria: I am basing my list off of three things: Competitive play, Value to your team, and overall game mechanics. 

Honorable Mentions: FaZe Jaomock, 100T Kenith, 100T Parallax, FaZe Tennp0, LG Kreo, NRG Kaysid, Commandment TTV, Ghost Ghoul, CoL Hogman. 

10. Ghost Bizzle- Originally, I had put Ghoul over Bizzle based on game mechanics, but after seeing Bizzle’s competitive play, I had no choice but to put him on the list. He carried Kittyplays to two wins in the Week 7 summer skirmish, and in both games, their strong positioning set them up for fairly smooth victories. He plays for an undisputed top 3 pro team in Ghost Gaming, and his partner, Dmo, are an S tier duo. 
Strength: Competitive Play

9. NRG Zayt- Zayt is a very solid all around player that doesn’t seem to have many flaws in his game. I look back to the week 3 skirmish, where Zayt and his partner, Saf, missed two games early on and still managed to crawl back and earned themselves a first place victory in the comeback of the year. In the final game, Zayt won them the game by jumping on the medder in the final zone and killing him with 18 hp. To keep composure in that type of situatipn earns him a place of the list. He is the highest earning NA player in the top 10 earnings not named Vivid or Poach. 
Strength: Competitive Play


8. Ghost Saf- Saf is the youngest player on the list at the age of 16 but shouldnt be taken lightly. He is one of the best playground build battles players on this list and has great positioning, earning him a lot of solo and duo scrim wins with his partner Ghost Ghoul. The only thing holding him back is his dreadful solo skirmish performance in week 4, and his overall lack of skirmishes played. However, he is still a very good solo player and I expect him to do well at PAXWEST. 
Strength: Game Mechanics. 


7. Liquid72HRS- Tom is a fantastic player on in my opinion, the best team in Fortnite at the moment. He is an insane builder and traps players with ease. His aim is off the charts and his timing with snipers is next to none. He has performed well in skirmishes, twice placing third with Liquid Chap and carrying AlexiaRaye to solid placements in Twitch Rivals. He is yet to prove himself in a solo skirmish however, and im sure he is hoping to do so at PAXWEST. 
Strength: Game Mechanics. 


6: FaZe Tfue- The most popular on the list and theres a reason. Tfue has above average building skills and is tied for the best aim on the list. I am not a fan of his ego but that doesnt take away from his great gameplay. He is the best pubstomper in the game, in my opinion, and a great competitive player when playing with Faze Cloak. He is a good communicator and a good member to have on your team. He has not had very good skirmish performances and that is what keeps him at number 6. 
Strength: Game Mechanics

5. Faze Cloak- After watching Cloak play competitive for 5 minutes, you can tell hes the best at callouts and communication in the game. He is a BR veteran that has above average game mechanics. I dont think that his 2nd place performance in week 2 skirmish holds too much weight, seeing as it was a pubstomping format. However, he has played well enough in the skirmishes to earn him this spot. 
Strength: Value to Team

4. Liquid Chap- Chap and 72HRS are nearly interchangeable, which is what I think makes them such a godly duo. He has incredible game mechanics and also seems to put himself in the position to win the game, an ability that I feel is one of the hardest in the game. He is the best playground build fighter on this list and has had good performances in the tournies. 
Strength: Game Mechanics

3. Ghost Dmo- One thing stands out about Dmo: consistency. He is one of the most consistent players in the game, placing well in the skirmish every single he is invited. In the twitch rivals skirmishes, he made King Richard look like an incredible pro player. His game mechanics are very good and he’s just an extremely solid all around player. 
Strength: Value to team

2: NotVivid- Heres where it gets difficult. Vivid and the number 1 player are so close, I wouldnt argue with anyone telling me hes number 1. He is the consistent player in the game, performing well in every skirmish hes been in. His game mechanics are very good, with his aim being top of the line. He is an efficient builder who doesnt waste mats to acheive his goal. Whichever org lands Vivid will be in for a treat. 
Strengths: Competitive Play

1. Liquid Poach- When watching Poachs stream, you can immediately see his god tier abilities. He has a calming presence in any scenario and always makes the right call. In solo scrims, he is the most consistent winner and in competitive play, he excels and thrives off the pressure. He is the most well rounded player, with great builds and pin point aims. When playing with Vivid in week 5, he took command and made all of the right plays, earning them a first place prize. If Liquid had a captain for their team, I think without a doubt, poach would be the man for the job.  
Strength: Competitive play

So as the visitor of was trying to leave something went wrong(this next part coming from another post) so basically Battle Royale is like a training camp thing to prepare for Save The World, and it isn’t meant to be left creating a rift and such(next part is mine) Basically I think that the visitor is stuck inside the cube and slowly making his way to Destroy Tilted Towers.
TL:DR - The visitor is in the cube trying to destroy Tilted Towers because is attempt to with the Meteor failed.

Watching streams, I have seen how Pros play with their whole arm, while I use my wrist, a pretty small mousepad and high sensitivity. I just took the first step of the process by buying a new pad today. But I would like to know if you guys have any keys or advice on how to practice (methods you use) or if you have any story or videos I can learn from in order to do a faster transition.

CS:Source's bhopping is the only reason I bought it on steam, and there are whole communities dedicated to it in CS:GO and Source. 

Alas, skill based movement has been almost completely removed from modern games, my theory on this is because of the pursuit of realism and because most of these things can't be replicated on console. The only game I can think of recently is titanfall.

In playground mode I can build just as fast as these guys and also edit just as fast, however, when it gets to scrims and just pubs in general I tend to mess up a lot because all of those build battles are usually reacting to the opponent. In playground mode, for practice at least, you are solely focusing on your self and on the buildings you are trying to build, however, when vsing someone else you don't just account for yourself but you also gotta react to the opponent and their buildings etc...

So what this does, for me atleast, is that since I practice to build quick, whenever I encounter an opponent and all the sudden I am not looking at my character anymore, but have my eyes kind of wider on the screen to focus on my opponent, I find my self often building over my self or making lots of dumb little build mistakes.

I want to reach a point kind of like Martoz on YT where he builds in such a smart way and knows every decision he is going to take next. Because right now I don't think when I build, I just react to the enemy and build as fast as possible and rely on muscle memory, i don't know if their are any exercises to practice that kind of build that ""smart"" decision making when building.

I may be asking for lots here so please if the thread is confusing let me know and I will try to edit it in a better way but

Currently, if you have (for example) one tactical shotgun as your only weapon, fire it once, build, and then return to your shotgun, you're not allowed to shoot until the shotgun timer is complete. This is unnecessary, and as mentioned, makes the game more clunky and less skilful.

&amp;#x200B;

**Before Season 5:**  

Shoot -&gt; Build or switch weapon -&gt; Shoot

&amp;#x200B;

**After Season 5:**  

Shoot -&gt; Build or switch weapon -&gt; Wait for unnecessary shotgun timer -&gt; Shoot

&amp;#x200B;

**My Suggestion:**  

Make it so the shotgun timer only applies to shotguns other than the one that was originally fired.  

So if I have a pump and a tactical, I should be able to ***pump -&gt; build -&gt; pump***, but not ***pump -&gt; build -&gt; tactical.***

This would improve the overall feeling of the game whilst also preventing double shotgun.",FortniteCompetitive

Before I begin, I’d like to say some things. This post is to incite discussion, not to unnecessarily build up, or take down a player. This is no call to action. Please don’t allow this post to hold any weight than it should; it is my opinion, nothing more. That said, I hope you enjoy!

In terms of how I evaluated players, I focused on 3 aspects of gameplay: Pubs, playground, and actual competitions. Pubs performance is only to set the player’s style and observe what strategies they do and don’t use. Playground is very helpful in that you can gauge solely their skill, as fights are done on a completely even playing field. 

1. Liquid Poach

When I first watched him play, all I could think was “WOW!”. He seems so natural in his movements and plays, almost to the point it makes me wonder if he was born to play this game. His performance in the Summer Skirmish has been consistent and fantastic. His usage of edits is the perfectly prescribed amount IMO. The ONLY flaw that I can find in his game is that he could get more kills in midgame competitive. 

2. NotVivid

Although at times he appears to lack in some mechanical skill, he more than overcomes that with nothing less than the best ingame IQ. Having the best overall performance in Summer Skirmish is a huge reason as to why he is here. He always seems to be in the top 10. 

3. Atlantis Mitro

Although I’ll be one to admit that I don’t know as much about or pay attention to EU competitive, Mitro has been the best of the bunch this summer. He has demonstrated an ability to win with anyone. I’ll have to watch him a lot more but to be a standout on a similar level to NotVivid in the EU, whether or not you believe one is better than the other, is impressive. 

4. Fnatic Eryc

At this point I believe there is a ‘tier down’ from the top three, this is expected, since the resume’s of those higher is just incomparable at this point due to the lack of competitions. Up until about a week ago I didn’t consider Eryc this highly, until I watched him play. I had a similar feeling of amazement that I did when I first watched Poach play. He is the most efficient builder that I’ve seen play. If Ninja decided to take the pro scene seriously, I’d imagine this is what he’d look like. 

5. Solary Kinstaar

I think Kinstaar is the most underrated player at this point, and that is due to two things. Solary’s horrible streaming setup which leads to less exposure, and his greatest accomplishment coming at a time where competitive wasn’t taken as seriously. That being his utter domination of the Pro AM a couple of months ago. In one game I think he had 11 kills to his name, which is the only 10 kill game that I am aware of in any official competition. Finally he won a Summer Skirmish today, so I don’t think it will be much longer before he starts to get some recognition. 

6. Secret Domentos

Domentos is the hardest to pin down on this list. As far as I know he has only streamed his gameplay once, and I was lucky enough to watch that stream. If I were to describe his playstyle, I’d compare it to SypherPK, but faster. To get you an idea of how good he is, he plays in 1054X1080 resolution (“nuff said”). In addition he has won multiple competitions throughout the history of competitive Fortnite, which is the main reason to his presence here. 

7. 100T Parallax

Believe it or not, in my first iteration of this list I didn’t have him in the top 10. That was stupid. He is one of the best pub players in the game and has some tournament success to add to it. I haven’t seen him do playground, but I’m sure he’d do pretty well if he did. 

8. Liquid 72Hours

Honestly I think 72Hours and Chap are nearly interchangeable in terms of their overall skill, but I had to give 72Hours the nod here. I can’t explain it, but I do get the feeling that he is better than Chap, and deserves this slot. 

9. Sup Refl7ction

If I were to describe Refl7ction’s play in a sentence: He jumps out of the bus, places his finger on the W key, and DOES. NOT. LET. GO. Furthermore, he plays on 100 ping, which many players know is a very big handicap. He also has some performance in Summer Skirmish to his name. 

10. Ghost Dmo

I think Dmo is a blue-collar type player. Nothing spectacular, but he’ll get the job done. What I’m trying to say is he is very consistent. From the second place finish a couple weeks back to the great weekend last week, Dmo is obviously a top 10 player.

Notable Omissions:

TSM Hamlinz- Although he passes the eye test (in pubs) with flying colors, he just hasn’t performed in the Summer Skirmish. Yeah, you could claim that he hasn’t had the best partners, but the best don’t need great partners to be able to succeed. Even then, Myth is pretty good so there should be no reason for him to not do well. 

Kayuun- Another example of a player who passes the eye test, he is not included for different reasons than Hamlinz. That is, he is so unknown. He doesn’t scrim a lot and doesn’t participate in competitions (yet). I do think he will be a top-10 player once he joins a team and gets into some tournies. 

Members of Faze, and Ghost- Listen, this is not a team ranking, this is a player ranking. They can manage to be the best 4 man teams yet not have many top-10 players. They are mainly composed of top 30 players; it’s difficult to get 4 top 30 players in a group! Players to watch on these teams include Temp0 and SAF.

The events span across four days, two events per day, with the first on August 17. Each will be a part of Epic Games’ ongoing Fortnite Summer Skirmish Series, including 49 duo teams from EU or NA competing for $260,000 in their respective regions.

The first event in the four-event series starts Friday, August 17 with the European tournament at 9 AM PT followed by the North American tournament at 2 PM PT. You can catch all of the action on twitch.tv/TwitchRivals or watch some of the streamers’ perspectives on their own channels:

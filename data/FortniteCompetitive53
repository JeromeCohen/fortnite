Sure, the first couple of SS' were a bit boring while they were figuring things out, but once they implemented custom lobbies it was great. It was pros vs pros with high stakes and epic late games, and all around great gameplay that you could look forward to and learn from. On the other hand, FF was rather boring and got stale quickly after the initial hype of a tournament. I understand that UMG and keemstar didn't have access to custom lobbies, but the public lobby kills format was boring. While there might have been more kills that were happening, it was in a public lobby so only 1 in 10 fights was remotely exciting. Meanwhile, late in the SS format while 10 kills was a high number compared to 20+ in FF, each of those kills was thoroughly earned in an epic and exciting to watch build fight, gun fight, or snipe off. 

One of the main points that SS opposers bring up is the RNG of the thing, but personally I   don't think that it was a big deal. Maybe a player might get bad loot and be at a disadvantage, but that is just how battle royale games work. In a FF public lobby someone could get unlucky and die to a no skin, so I feel like RNG isn't an issue. 

Anyways, I was just interested to hear why people were so opposed to SS and eager for FF to return. ",FortniteCompetitive

Fortnite does contain an element of RNG and each game tends to play out very differently from the rest due to the enourmous number of factors involved in a single game. Therefore it is very difficult to be a dominant team. Different teams and players seem to be popping off every other week - and then there are players like Nate Hill who seem to be consistent in coming top 10, but haven't won anything major yet (unless you count twitch rivals).

It's even worse in EU where it honestly feels like there are 52 different teams who take it in turns to have a week as the best team. At first it was Solary, then Gentside, then Atlantis appeared. I saw Team Secret drop 20 kills in a stacked custom squad lobby the other day.

Unless one top team beats another teams a few times in a row in tournaments I don't think it is possible to say which team or player is definitively the best. But we can pretty certainly say that Ghost and Liquid are top tier NA teams with FaZe and nV up there on their day and then we have a second tier with BOXR, C9, SEN, ~~NRG~~, 100T and a few others.",FortniteCompetitive

I consider myself a top fortnite player on console. Have a 9 kd and was playing on standard up until a month ago. My aim is my strong suit so getting kills isn't a problem but my building is nowhere close to my standard speed.

 Finally switched to builder pro and have played a lot since then. For some reason I just can't outbuild on builder pro. It feels like it's so hard to get higher ground, although for simple things like placing a floor when you might take fall damage builder pro is better.  I see people like aydan etc building so fluidly and quickly gettting high ground but I just can't find the rhythm for it.

 Is it because I use the same finger for walls and floors (R1 and R2)?

Thanks!",FortniteCompetitive

Do you feel like this is a good thing or a bad thing?

Just to give you an example of what I'm talking about, here's a list of all of the changes/items added that are removing high ground advantage strategies:

- explosives (rockets, guided missile, grenade launcher, grenade, C4): Used to destroy structures quickly, removing high ground advantage
- stink bombs: Used to force people from their high ground perch
- rifts, port-a-rifts, launchpads: Used to gain absolute high ground advantage
- impulse, shockwave, bounce pads: Used to quickly gain high ground (or in shockwave's case, high ground + destruction of structure)
- grappling hook: Used to gain high ground advantage extremely quickly
- storm damage to structures on storm edge late game: Clearly destroys high ground advantage late game


In my opinion, I'm really getting a bit frustrated with just how many ways my high ground can be taken from me now. With so many options open, it's likely that anyone you go up against will have at least one of these at their disposal. Meaning you have to deal with over a dozen different techniques that can be used against you to screw you out of your high ground advantage.

To me it feels like there's almost no point in building higher than 3 levels at all anymore, because you're just asking to be overtaken or for your entire structure to be destroyed. You can no longer ramp rush over someone because you never know if they have explosives... and now a grappling hook which can literally nullify your entire ramp rush with one click of the mouse.

I'm all for mixing up the gameplay and making things interesting, but at what point does it just get ridiculous? Are they going to add jetpacks back in also? What happened to getting better position over another player by having better rotations and building? That's all gone now. You can just use any one of a dozen methods to flip the advantage. Just stay low ground with any explosives, grappling hook, shockwave, etc... and wait for your opponent to build. Then surprise them with your item and you win.

I just feel that it cheapens the experience overall. I've gotten kills that felt like I didn't earn them at all... like the item did all the work for me, and I've gotten killed when I had the advantage and it was instantly taken away from me because of one item. It's just that type of gameplay that is frustrating and not rewarding and honestly I feel like it cheapens the game overall.

The reason I lose the plurality of my fights is because I get lost in navigating between modes and weapons.



To clarify, Im talking about how you press Y to get into axe mode then Y to get out of axe mode.  The reason for this is because there is no dedicated weapons mode button.  Weapons is considered the default mode and everything else stacks from there.  An extreme example of this would be when you pull out your axe and get shot at and immediately turtle for protection and now you edit out to attack.  So now you have edit mode stacked on top of build mode stacked on top of axe mode stacked on top of your default weapons mode.  To get into weapons mode you press b to accept your edit, then b to exit build back to axe mode and finally Y to exit axe mode.  Congrats, you have made it back to weapons mode and hopefully you were already on your weapon you want or you may need a few more buttons to get your weapon of choice out.  Compare this to PC where you would just press the button of the gun you want.


I understand that we are limited by the number of buttons we have to work with but eliminating the stacking system and giving each mode a dedicated button would help.  By doing this it would free up buttons within each mode for more functionality.   For example, When you are in build mode, instead of pressing B to exit, you could have B be an instant edit or change mats and traps.  Giving weapons mode a dedicated button ( Y for example)  would mean you could give the Y button a hotkey for a specific weapon while in weapons mode.  So you could consistently get to your shotgun by double tapping Y.


#The setup that I would choose is as follows:


B for build mode (b swaps mats in mode)


Left stick click for axe (I use auto sprint)


Y for weapons mode and always goes to first slot.  Pressing Y in mode would swap the first two slots back and forth (great for shotgun SMG combo).  Holding Y takes you to your third slot.  Left bumper in mode for 4th slot and right bumper in mode for 5th slot.



When you start to add in scuff paddles you could get even more specific keybinds but that requires EPIC to allow us to get rid of the stacking navigation system.

I’ve seen an incredible amount of frustration with the meta, and with that, we tend to see the argument turn to: “Epic balances around casuals.”

When you look at that statement through competitive eyes, it looks frustrating. How can a game that wants to be Esports balance around the casual base, right?

However, if we look at that statement as objectively as possible we can start to see the possibility of a different philosophy and why it makes a little more sense. Balancing around the casual base, adding new weapons often, and focusing on content creation keeps casual players interested, keeps the game feeling fresh and exciting. We may largely feel like we’re being ignored on the competitive side at times, but we have seen a lot of our *demands* answered. At times it may not be as quickly as we’d like, but if we’re being totally realistic, at we times ask for too much.

The amount of casual interest in this game keeps these prize pools high. With these high prize pools, we’ve seen large organizations enter the scene, and we’ve seen Epic evolve at a quick rate to keep up with the demand of a quality tournament showing. When we ask to vault weapons, or nerf them into the ground, we also may be asking to make the game more stale. The more weapons and items we have, the more this game will appeal to every type of player. As competitive players and fans, we should want to keep and generate as much interest in the scene as possible.

I really want to be clear that I do agree some weapons/items DO need to be addressed and pulled in line with others. I just want to be clear that I feel removing things is a slippery slope we shouldn’t look to go down.",FortniteCompetitive

I’ve fluctuated between all sorts of sensitivities but would mainly run 10 x 10. But for around 2 or 3 months I’ve been running 10 x 6 and I’ve been hitting more shots than ever while still outbuilding everyone. I’ve seen an insane improvement in overall aim / shotgun consistency and I still outbuild 9.5 out of 10 of the people I encounter (and for reference, I use a controller on pc) 

This sensitivity not only allows me to still build and turn around very quickly but allows for me to be more accurate while jumping over people / jump shots in general. 

Now of course, sensitivity is all down to the player and if you can master 5 x 5 or even 10 x 10 than all props to you! 

But for anyone struggling with high sensitivity and aim, DEFINITELY try this out, because it helped me immensely. 

Hell I’m not even too worried about separate building and aiming sensitivity anymore hahahaha, although it’d sill be an overall nice feature. ",FortniteCompetitive

I know Epic have nerfed farming because they want the game to be more versatile instead of being focused on building alone. They obviously want this because new players struggle with the aspect of building and how to use it efficiently. 

If I was in charge I’d immediately buff the farming rate to 1.5x. This’d help competitive players go for more kills instead of farming the whole game, which also makes up for a really boring viewing experience that can discourage casual players from watching.

I am an average solos player who wins a large amount of squad games with our group because we quickly figured out these tips.  Most of these come with time played as a group, but they are important to think about if your squad dies consistently in these situations. 

1. Positioning as a squad. Especially in mid-range fights. You want to be close enough together to be able to cover a downed teammate if he gets shot, but far enough apart that you have slightly different angles on the opposing players. Force them to worry about multiple angles when peeking, without spreading so far that one player is an easy kill. 

2. When you knock one opposing player, watch for the rotation. When a player gets knocked, teammates must make a move to do something, and will typically collapse onto the player. This is a huge decision moment for your squad. If only one of their players is pushing to the downed teammate, consider AR spamming him as a group while he is rotating and exposed. If multiple teammates rotate to the downed player, consider pushing as a large group to collapse on the now-grouped up opposition for quick finishes. 

3. Coordinate revives. Similar to 2, when one of your teammates gets knocked, ensure that someone is covering the downed teammate for a later revive while others keep an eye on the enemies for a push. If your whole squad sprints for the revive, you allow the opposition to push uncontested. 

4. Coordinate pushes. So so so often squads die while pushing because nobody lays down fire. We have one teammate who ALWAYS carries ‘splodes of some sort to lay down cover fire while we push, which enables us to push nearly uncontested most of the time. Without ‘splodes, we typically have one or two players lay down AR fire to cover the push. 

5. Understand basic rotations. Be able to acknowledge where the heavy rotation sides will be in a given circle, and based on your squad’s skill, plan to either gatekeep or rotate further into the circle to avoid the cluster that becomes that rotation. Further, in the late-late circles, don’t leave the push to the outside circles (the moving storm) until the last second - this allows an established team to pick you off while you’re scrambling to get safe and avoid storm damage. 

Be sure to throw out any tips or information that you have as well, a large portion of this sub are significantly better solos players than I am!",FortniteCompetitive

The workaround right now is to either switch to the same structure you want to edit or switch to your pickaxe before you start editing, but this is can be a bit clunky especially since your building don't always place after you've switched to your pickaxe and back (epic pls fix).

Competitive fortnite needs to be less RNG in my opinion. We no longer see build fights due to third partying. I feel what im about to suggest could be another way for fortnite to enter the competitive scene.

So, two players choose a loadout of their choice. They then both spawn into a smaller version of the fortnite map, and have a 1v1 face off. 

Pros - Exciting to watch, Less RNG, No third partying and fun build offs, More skill based

Cons -Takes away the BR aspect.

This could also be applied where two squads or duos land.

Absolutely love the game and have stuck with it through the good and bad. But recently I've developed some repetitive stress injuries to my keyboard hand/wrist that will just not heal up. I've found that to play at a competitive level in Fortnite, you're pressing many more keys than you would in any other game. This has caused my hand and wrist to develop some major issues that just won't stop. Even when I take a prolonged break from the game, the RSI pain comes back with just a few hours of playing Fortnite again.

Lets just look at an example of League of Legends vs Fortnite:

Keystrokes in a teamfight of League are going to consist of Q, W, E, R, F, G and maybe a few # keys. All these keystrokes are going to happen at a much lower frequency than Fortnite.

A fight in Fortnite is going to look a lot different. In just one fight I can press Q W E R T A S D F G Z X C V 1 2 3 4 5 tab and space.

I'm planning on doing some keyboard mapping. 1 game of League vs 1 game of Fortnite. But if I had to guess, I would say that difference in keystrokes is in the 1000s.

At the end of the day, Fortnite is not an ergonomical game for KBM. I really wish I could keep grinding 6-8 hours a day and competing in scrims, but it just seems that Fortnite is no longer in the cards for me. I've gone from playing everynight, all night, to just a couple games a week here and there. I guess my hand just can't keep up.

I can consistently get 12+ kill wins in pubs and if I try I can win most of the games I play. I have a 6.70 KD In solos this season. 

That being said, I have been absolutely getting my shit rocked these past couple nights playing solo scrims in the FNPL discord. I have never done any sort of snipes before this. I feel accomplished just getting a kill in one of those stacked lobbies. 

I usually try to analyze every death and realize what I did wrong but I don’t even know if this is a good way to improve. Also, it might just be in my head and I just need to play normal, but it feels like if I try to play it aggressive like a pub my opponent will annihilate me.

Is there any tips/advice/words of wisdom any solid scrim players can give me? Thanks guys! ",FortniteCompetitive

It doesn't give a major competitive advantage but it makes the system feel much smoother and all around better.

I have a mouse that's solid, but it's cheap and has no extra buttons, just the standard left &amp; right clicks and the mouse wheel.

It used to be my sprint before changing to sprint automatically). My weapons are on 4-1-2-3-Z-X. Other than that, I think it's default.

So, I've been looking through old keybind threads, and I've seen literally no one who uses the mouse wheel to build walls and stairs.

I hope it also improves your Fortnite game.,"**TLDR at bottom** 

*If you are a PS4 player, please convert A and B to X and O.*

A lot of console players have been visiting this sub with questions regarding which accessories to purchase for their controller to bring their game to the next level.  By now, console players should know that some form of paddle attachment, elite controller, etc. is the go to move.  Map your left paddle to Jump, right paddle to Build, and you are good to go.

**Techniques to actually get used to the paddles and train your muscle memory are rarely talked about, however.**  I wanted to post a pretty unique approach that I took to get used to the change and build up my muscle memory.

**Background:** I recently purchased the FPS Strikepack and, like many others, had difficulties adjusting to actually utilizing the paddles instead of sticking to my muscle memory and mashing A or B in sticky situations.  My first day was split between testing out the paddles in game and in playground, and nothing was sticking. Day 2 was even worse, and Day 3 I maybe felt slightly more comfortable.

I was not pleased with hardly progressing 3 Days into my investment because I am naturally a very impatient person, and I hated watching my game play suffer.  I did some research on techniques to build muscle memory in any aspect of life, and came across a study I read in college conducted by John Hopkins Medicine that explained an alternative approach to building muscle memory (link to study at bottom).

**The standard muscle memory training approach:**: Essentially, when we think about building muscle memory for a certain activity we assume that the best way to learn is to complete the activity over and over and over.  If you want to change your golf swing, you go to the driving range and practice that swing over and over and over.  This is no different to going into Playground mode and practicing 1x1s, editing, etc.

**The adjusted muscle memory training approach:** The study below explains that the above approach is indeed beneficial, **however** muscle memory can be improved quicker by ""making slight changes during repeat practice sessions instead of practicing the task in precisely the same way"" 

We assume that you have to be playing Fortnite to get used to the paddles. Per the above language, this would fall under ""practicing the task in precisely the same way"".  I decided that before getting used to the paddles in Fortnite, I had to get used to the paddles in general.  

The ""slight change"" that the study references, for me, was to play a game where I was not heavily reliant on muscle memory.  By picking up a game you are unfamiliar with, you can incorporate the paddles into game play without having the natural urge to press other buttons that perform the same function.  For me, I downloaded COD MW2, a game I have not played for years, and hopped into a lobby.  I relied on left paddle for Jump/Climb, and right paddle for crouch/drop shot.

By playing MW2 on Day 4 for a couple of hours with absolutely no reliance on muscle memory, I was able to learn to rely on the paddles without any inclination to utilize A and B on my controller.  As a result, my brain became more accustomed to utilizing the paddles and getting used to my hand placement, and less reliant on pressing A and B.

Day 5 I switched back to Fortnite and felt much more comfortable utilizing the paddles, because I became comfortable with them in a different format (MW2).  By training my brain to learn the task of utilizing paddles in game play and training myself to forget about A and B entirely, those skills transitioned into Fortnite almost immediately.

If I had taken the approach I started on Day 4 I believe I could have gotten used to the paddles in no more than a day or two.  Hopefully this works out for you!

**TLDR;**  Do not solely play Fortnite when adjusting to your paddles. Even better, play a game you are unfamiliar with. By training my brain to get used to the task of utilizing paddles into ANY game where my brain was not accustomed to muscle memory, it actually made me better at incorporating the change in Fortnite.

It's clear something is wrong with TSM at the moment.

From underperforming, to Daequan not showing intent to improve, Vivid rejecting them, and they still need a 4th.

Here are a few options I would like to see:

Option 1: Get Just a 4th

The most simple, but probably least effective. If needed Dae and Ham could duo up and one of these could duo with Myth. Possible options I would like to see: Reverse2k, Snood, Saint, xil or Aipha. I think Saint is the best option - comment your thoughts on these and other players!

Option 2: Daequan becomes a content creator and TSM sign a ready formed duo

Daequan has said he focuses on his stream- so become a content creator! This would leave 2 open spaces for a ready made and well-gelled duo. I would like to see: A duo from ""Snobby Boys"" (BaeSoldier and Bartonologist came 2nd in a skirmish) - or ""RAiN"" (Snood and whoever his partner is)  (Both F/A duos). Thoughts?

Option 3: A Complete Overhaul

\-Daequan becomes a solo player (Maybe a duo with Yanni or someone)

\-Myth and Ham choose 2 new team mates

\-TSM sign a whole new squad (Probably Snobby Boys or RAiN)

\- Sign a couple of new solo players - Saint, Snood, Aipha, Reverse 2k, xil, Kayuun etc.

WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK? I Like option 3! Who should TSM snatch up? Get discussing!

Here is the list of the top 10 players that this subreddit voted 1 month ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/926fpt/rfortnitecompetitives_top_ten_pc_players_right/So lets finally get to the results.

1. Vivid (Liquid)
2. Poach (Liquid)
3. Chap (Liquid)
4. Tfue (Faze)
5. Dmo (Ghost)
6. 72hrs (Liquid)
7. Cloakzy (Faze)
8. Saf (Ghost)
9. Zayt (NRG)
10. Bizzle (Ghost)

As you can see mostly dominated by Liquid, Ghost and Faze. 

Very interesting to see what the community thought a month ago and what they think now, for example, TSM_Daequan was 9th on that list while now he wasnt even mentioned and is one of the most ""Hated"" players in this subreddit.

Anyway thank you for voting commenting and suggesting! 
Lets make a list like some months later and see how that will turn out!

If it is please just correct me. This post is not intended to say that double pump should come back or anything like that. Just a discussion of its impact on competitive play. 

*I was thinking recently after watching the whole summer skirmish and really getting in and watching a lot of scrims: Double Pump would not change the meta for pros much if at all - especially not with the new double barrel.* 

When I watch pros fight either with edits or in a more traditional build battle - I rarely see anyone leave themselves unprotected to the point where the second pump shot can be taken. At high level play, players predict their opponents shots really well and build really well. Double pump does allow for much better burst damage if you hit your shots - but it also needs a longer window of exposure. And with edits/turbo building I just do not think pros would regularly allow themselves to get hit with the second pump. The double pump also means heavy sacrifice with the many valuable items epic has since added to the game. Taking a second shotty likely means dropping an ar, heals, splodes, smg, or mobility item. Each of which has a very important use in the pro scene that double shotty can not fill. Meaning I don't think it is viable to pick up vs people who can really build.

I also think double pump would not alter 50/50s much. Yes there are bloom fights where all the shots miss not do to the aim. However I still think generally with the pump damage where it is smgs will generally prevail in dps even over double pump a higher percentage of the time. I think double pump seems like a much more skilled 50/50 because you have to hit you shots. But pump damage isn't constant so its really just a different form of RNG. It really isn't all that different to spam a drum gun vs firing shottys that might do like 11 damage. Now there may be a difference in the skill involved but when the goal is to win, it doesn't matter if one way is less skilled or not*.(you can argue the semantics of game design and what is good for a game and bad for a game in another post)* This just makes me believes that even in a 50/50 the double pump would not help. Also pro players do not usually take 50/50 fights unless they absolutely have to.

I think that double pump is really useful against players that do not build or do not build fast because it is ridiculous burst damage and you do not need to worry about having spray as much since the player likely won't turtle fast enough or at all. I think that largely double pump would not really change much other than we would probably see a surge in high kill solo squads games again.

I have played PC on Fortnite in the past but play only console now. I know there are many people in this community who use both platforms, but I'm sure there are also plenty who don't. For this post, please note I'm speaking mainly in the context of Fortnite unless otherwise noted. Lastly, I'm here to have a discussion and not start a flame war.

Aiming mechanics on console are easier when you are talking about mid-range tracking. The reason being, all you have to do is aim close to them and AA should drag your crosshair to them. However, there's more skill involved than it might seem simply because you do have to be able to track them pretty closely with your joystick- not always an easy thing to do. After the 5.3 patch, AA was nerfed hard and you have to be pretty close to them in order for AA to go to them. I assure you that a new player, or just the average console player, isn't going to be able to successfully track and use AA to laser you consistently. Getting the muscle memory down to track them with your thumb takes a fair amount of practice, and on a moving target, you will still have to track them, even after AA brings you to them.

I think aiming on PC is easier in every other situation. I only played PC for a short amount of time, but I was already hitting flick shots with my shotgun that are simply not possible on console. There is no replacement for having the full range of motion and precision granted by a mouse. Same goes for sniping, micro adjustments are much easier to make with a mouse.

All console players can also tell you that AA fucks you more than you might think. In close range fights, sometimes AA will track to them but if they begin moving, your cross hair will stay behind them, instead of on them, causing you to miss shots and probably die. If there are two enemies in close proximity to one another, AA may stick to one, costing you valuable seconds if you decide to engage the other.

AA HAS to be present on console in order to keep things fairly balanced in the game and allow weapons to be viable at anything beyond point blank. Aiming with a joystick and your thumb is simply too much of a handicap otherwise. I bet if you asked any console player and any PC player, the overwhelming majority would choose the precision of a mouse over controller when it comes to aiming. I will also say that high level PC players still have amazing mid-range AR shots and only a select few console players can rival that, even with AA.

&amp;#x200B;

Please stop belittling console players for having no skill or abusing AA. I assure you it takes more skill than some of you are making it out to be. It takes a HUGE amount of skill in order to be able to compete competitively with PC players because console players are disadvantaged in every other way, from building, to editing, to even swapping weapons.

Knowing I can play at that level (not sure i would have done well against those insane players.) Being realistic, &amp; knowing the limitations first hand. I hate to brust everyones bubble, but I've been seeing alottt of people begin to believe the top console players, are the same level as the top PC players when that couldnt be further from the truth. 

Being someone who watches alot of fortnite, &amp; watching a wide variety of top players. If Nick, Ayden or any other console/controller playee were to run into any legitimate PC pro. Or guys like Poach, Vivid, Nate Hill, Mongraal, Dae, Ninja in something other than a passive, win incentive environment. Itd be over before it started.

Basically almost every game Ayden died basically his next fight out of titled. (Nick did make it out once to late game &amp; killed like 5 of the very top players) I say that to say, somewhere like titled players like Ayden, or Nick thrive because building in titled is strategic, not high ground, high ground. So the limitations become obsolete to an extent in those situations. It comes down to aim, positioning, decision making, &amp; ofc a little rng. Where console players can compete fairly in those instances. Ayden &amp; Nick were obviously the most entertaining but we all knew their only shot at winning was slaying early game, stacking up points. No one thought they'd be placing top 10 every game or winning any. 

I say this only to say, imo the storm damage update coming shifts the competitive meta back to season 3 scrims. Where not every game comes down to 1 player at the very top, another at the bottom hoping they have more HP. When teams like TSM really shined &amp; build battles were actually a thing in something other than pubs. (Alot better to watch also) teams wont be so passive, fights won't come to a hault so quickly, and building/edits will become the main focus again. If I'm completely wrong, and the end gamea are basically the same as now, I can see a few console/controller players being in actaul tournaments. If meta shifts backs more to aggressive, mid game fights, skill vs skill I don't see any of us controller players realistically playing a role.

Immediately from this we can see the biggest difference between the games today at the Skirmish. Aydan played far more consistently, and was able to decidedly win the head to head against Nick 4-0 over the course of their seven drops at Tilted. He was often able to claim Tilted as his own, reap the full benefits in terms of loot, and create for himself a strong position for midgame. In addition his point consistency from slaying was excellent, managing 5 points from kills alone in the first 5 games. However Nickmercs had one single standout performance in game five, which saved his Skirmish and catapulted him from being one of the worst performers in the Skirmish overall, to top 10 at the time. Based off that one game alone Nickmercs was still able to finish in 17th place overall - in the double digit winnings bracket - despite only killing a single player in any of the other six games.

*Lets take a little closer look:*

 | || |
:--|--:|:--|--:|
 |Ghost Ayden||Nickmercs|
Total points:|5||4|
Avg Points per game|0.71||0.57|
Total Kills:|18||9|
Avg Kills per game|2.57||1.29|
Average placement|48.43||65.71|
Overall placing|11||17​|

We can very clearly see the difference in approach mirrored in these stats.The averages for Nickmercs are, as we know, very heavily skewed by his game 5 performance. Ayden's stats mirror his game-to-game sucess much more closely, with his absolutely monstrous KDA lining up well with how consistent his games were - at least up until game 5. Only the eventual winner MorgausseTV was able to kill more people - and that is despite the fact Morgausse not only had far more consistent placement than Aydan, but also won a game. 

However what is interesting to note is that *Aydan's average placement score is remarkably low*, and certainly far lower than you'd expect for someone with this number of kills.In fact Aydan did not get a single point from placement the entire tournament, with his highest placement being in Game 5 at 28th. While he was consistently able to reach the 40-30 range when he had a good game, Ayden often found he was not able to maintain his aggressive nature for very long without being third partied outside of his home and native land. 

The picture we develop from this is that while Ayden was able to clear tilted, *he struggled much more outside of it.* 55% of his kills were on players who dropped with him at Tilted, of which four of these were Nickmercs, Two were Twitch Extatic (also on console) and two were FLY Crunch (87th place, PC). The other two were Misfits Jiren, and Tempo Sicarios, who later got his revenge from Aydan rushing him minute one with better loot. Yet more kills came as people rotated into or through tilted in addition to this, putting Aydens success outside of the safety of his landing spot remarkably low for his placement. 

*In fact if we were to remove eliminations that took place in early game 1v1s in Tilted Towers, then Ayden would not have recieved any points whatsoever the entire tournament.*

Nick does have an impressive record against PC players... when he got the chance to fight them and not Ayden. He picked up elims against top tier players such as Tennpo and Tfue, as well as a low hp Hysteria. However two thirds of Aydans kills did also come against PC players : including fellow Ghost member Saf, and 10th place finisher and game 5 winner, Bolt Naga Ops, as well as FLY Crunch three separate times. Only 6 of his kills came against console opponenets (4 of those being Nick). 


---

Lastly im going to take a look at how our two thumb warriors died over their seven games:

**Nickmercs** we know well died to Ayden in the 1v1 in games 1,2,4 and 6. In two of the other games Nick died to the other console player who dropped tilted consistently: Twitch_Extatic (76th place finisher, four time Tilted dropper). 

*Meaning in 6 out of seven games Nick was eliminated by a fellow console player, in Tilted Towers.*

**Aydan** meanwhile Died to (in order): JumpMaan , Myth ( fall damage), Snood, Marcitys,  Hysteria, NEACE, Tempo Sicarios. I believe all of these players are PC players, and in all except game 7 his death outside of Tilted, with him having secured at least one kill. From watching the vods this was usually either the result of a third party in one form or another, and often as a result of over-aggression.

This is just my opinion and I am open to discussing with others about their own opinion. My fault for the repost, bad title. 

To me, Poach has established himself as the clear number one player in the world right now. He checks every box that you could think of in a fortnite player. 

Mechanic Skill: The guys mechanic skill is clearly incredible. He is a god in playgrounds, consistently outbuilding top players and has a top tier shotgun shot, seeming to always hit head shots and has some nasty flicks. 

Slayer: Many people had said that Poach just camps and doesn’t have the ability to slay out and get kills and that is what holds him back from the top spot. Well at PAX, he put that notion to bed. He slayed out and was one of the leaders in total kills in the finals. He has also shown that ability previously, slaying out with 7 kills in the duo skirmish with Vivid, after Vivid fell early. 

Game IQ: The guy has the best game IQ in the game imo. He consistently reaches end game in scrims and tournaments, and always makes the best rotations. His ability to reach end game is next to none. Poach had the most Victory Royales out of everyone in the skirmishes. 

Consistency: Poach has shown up in every skirmish, placing 5th, 2nd, 1st, 6th, 9th, and 3rd. 
No matter the format, he always does his thing. 

In game leader: His ability to carry Tim was incredible, and resulted in them winning 2 out of the 5 total games. When playing with Vivid, an elite player, Poach took control and made incredible call outs which helped them win that skirmish.

Furthermore, console players which don't have controllers with custom remapping, paddles or play claw have to let go of the thumbstick everytime they want to jump, pick-up, toggle build, toggle pickaxe, imagine if you had to let go of your mouse everytime you wanted to do those commands.

[EU]","I'm not a god at the game, I'm a relatively new player, but I've been improving all the time from kds like 2 to 5 and like 2 weeks ago I was able to maintain stable 5,5kd. That's not important, just wanted to outline the situation. During last week or maybe even longer I felt an immense rise of level in Solos (im EU player). I can't remember a SINGLE early game without campers in buildings playing ultra safe and I also feel like I NEVER, like literally once every few games encounter a total noskin. For me the level has been so high that I literally dropped from having like under 6kd to 3kd this week. Furthermore, it's not only me who is experiencing this. My friend whom I consider a bit better than me (kd 6) has had the exact same experience, dropping to kd 2,5 (!).  
One thing I noticed is that I'm getting killed ONLY by good players. I occasionally get clapped by a 0,5 kd, but like every damn time I check that player's stats, it's in the range of 3-7 kd. I often check who killed me while I'm waiting for the next game and I've never seen such a thing.  
Another thing is that I've seen few streamers drop in skill/stats too.  
TLDR: my guess - LTMs attract so many players that the leftout ones can't stand the stomping they experience and they further migrate to those LTMs
The point is, my problem is not my mindset, trust me. I feel like I'm improving all the time, but lately I can't even survive those early games most of the times.

It's almost like FortNite has two ""classes"" you can choose from. If you choose controller, you sacrifice some building and quick flicks for effectively decreasing your bloom and increasing your scoped accuracy (via ADS spamming). I can't say it's personally my taste to watch controller players, and I don't know that aim-assist snapping onto targets is the most elegant solution, but I think it's fun that people with controllers and kb&amp;m can hop in a LAN and one side doesn't have an overwhelming advantage.

Once console edits are fixed controller players might even have the advantage. What a time to be alive!",FortniteCompetitive

**PROS**

* *Spectator Experience*.  Not only are we seeing the action, the cam is often switching to the OTHER person they are fighitng.  So we get to see both POV's.  This is amazing, whatever they changed from the previous weeks to this to make that happen.  Thank you.
* *Commentators*.  Courage is amazing.  Lupo is way better than before, but Courage carried this thing.  He seriously needs to be offered the job full time.  Courage and Monster might be the best duo atm.  I'd love to see it.  Zeke fits better in that interviewer role, it made for some good candid moments.
* *Stats / Standings!*  We got to see nearly live stats.  I do think this could be improved by an ongoing live statboard.  But we got close, and I was pretty happy.
* *Production*.  Despite a couple minor hiccups...everything went smooth.  No major lag, no crashes, no glitches.  They were on point it seemed from the outside.
* *Qualifiers*.  While it would have been cool to also watch the heats. The qualifiers are a GREAT way to get players in.  Building up other players, getting to know unknown pros.  Having a ""finale"" of games.  This was a great way to create suspense and anticipation for the following events.

**CONS**

* Forcing players to use your hardware(mouse, kb, monitor).  Nearly 100% of all professional events let players bring in their own mouse/kb/mousepad.  
* Forcing players to use specific settings.  Again, events typically let competitors change settings that they are used to.  I'm guessing this was done as a limitation to the spectator mode we are forced to watch.  
* Apparently some players got monitors with input delay, less FPS/refresh rate.  This is a HUGE oversight. All hardware needs to be 100% identical.
* While forcing players to use your setup is probably the #1 problem, the #2 problem would be the scoring system.  This felt like kind of a grand finale for the previous skirmish events.  So we should have used the most successful format.  Instead we create a new one which resulted in A LOT of turtling, many healoffs, and lots of dead action(I think we went 3minutes at one point with 0 deaths) ^To ^be ^clear, ^it ^was ^still ^exciting ^to ^watch.  ^I ^just ^believe ^it ^could ^have ^been ^better ^with ^slightly ^tweaked ^system.
* Some Audio issues.  Echo on the casting booth.  Minor, but still should have been fixed. 


Despite these cons, I felt the pros far outweighed them.  This was a great event. I'm pretty excited for the future of Competitive Fortnite.  ",FortniteCompetitive

Now that I have to juggle my index finger on both the triggers and L1/R1s I feel my building is just those seconds slower. When I first got the SCUF I tried to use my ring fingers for the paddles but that was way too uncomfortable. 

Couple that with jump shotting being pretty hard to do on console I really wonder whether a SCUF is even an improvement for FN. Like I’d rather focus on getting the head shots and strafing than jumping and risking a shot. 

The only real big improvement I feel like I’ve had from it is being able to edit easier and start buildings easier with the right paddle.

SOLOS : Lot of bots, easier early game, same mid-game, horrible late/end-game everyone camping and sniping with the heavy/semi auto.

DUOS : average level, people over camping/hiding, 3rd partying a lot.

SQUADS : Bots/average with some good players solo squading. Horrible game from start to end, everyone sniping, double barrel, you get 6th partied etc... 

Basically what I noticed and everyone must have pointed out is that less spamming weapons is great (even if it's not the best thing, I feel like the game is too slow without spam AND double pump, too much passive players/3rd party/sniping). 

Heavy sniper is cancer, anyone with little to no sniper skill can hit you for 150hp. 

Camping everywhere, squads and solos feels like scrims (duos was okay). 

Double barrel should get nerfed, ~~almost~~ anyone can kill you, without even needing good aim. Heavy shotgun HS often hit for 100-120... But you have to be kind of close. 

Gold Scar bloom is way too shitty, bullets go literally around the guy (≈10% of the crosshair isn't on the guy, yet all the bulletd go there, on the outside circle formed by the crosshair). 

Famas is in a great state, could use some faster FSA to compete with the Scar though, maybe make bloom more vertical than horizontal (~~like CS GO recoil~~). 

Golden pistol is almost useless. 

That's it for me, I really would like to know others thoughts!

We can probably agree that shotguns by themselves are in the best spots right now, no different shotgun is better than the other (some people prefer the blue tac over the gold heavy and vice versa), it's all preference

The tac has the lowest damage but has the fastest fire rate and highest mag size

The pump is a shotgun that doesn't need headshots, damage is good on body and head and only relies on hitting people

The heavy focuses on headshots but still has decent damage on body

The double focuses on bringing the target down the fastest at a cost of the slowest reload and mag size

Now let's get down to the main topic, SMGs

This is probably the point where it gets really opinionated
Drum is one of, if not, the best weapons in the game. Probably S tier. and it's sad cause I like the P90 but the drum is (generally) better than it. So to solve this balance problem, let's look at the state of the shotguns and borrow it to the smg's state

My personal changes are:
Drum's mag should be 40
The P90 should be a better destructor for buildings than the drum
Normal Smgs should increase it's damage by 1 and it's building destruction should be slightly better than the drum but not better  than the P90
and the Suppressed should probably increase it's fire rate and/or reload speed

This would make the:
Drum gun to have a reliable meaty damage to players but not to buildings
P90 to have the highest dps and the fastest destruction of buildings, but lasts the shortest and has to reload
SMG to be a general damage dealer and building destroyer
Suppressed to be the best damage to players but the worst to buildngs

Also, you can kinda see the correlations. Drum = Heavy, P90 = Double, SMG = Tac, Suppressed = Pump.

These will probably add diversity to loadouts and balance which is all I want.

Again, personal opinion. Peace.

Considering we can only carry 12 rockets (Excluding mag), why should we be allowed spray effortlessly?

Originally posted in [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR), I was encouraged to repost this here.

​

Over the past 4 months we've seen Myth go from being considered the best builder in the game, along with being acclimated as a top five player. A huge population of people even referred to him as the best overall player not too long ago. Currently he struggles to even get a kill or 2 in competitive settings, while appearing to be one of the lesser talented players, especially in this summer skirmish series. As we transitioned from the Pub Stomp style of game, into private competitive lobbies where only good players exist, and no potatoes to farm, we've seen Myth fall off a proverbial cliff. What has caused this sudden fall from grace from the second biggest streamer on twitch? By not being able to adapt to new metas, being crutched down by abusing a style of play that has been successfully phased out, and losing commitment to being the best as the competition has either caught or surpassed Myth, we've seen the steep downhill nosedive of one of the previous stars the game has had to offer.

​

It is important to acknowledge that just a few months ago Myth was still considered a notch above the top tier players in the community before the shifting of metas started to begin his downward fortnite spiral. He attended Ninjas Vegas event, and everybody seemed just as excited, if not more excited at the possible Ninja vs. Myth showdown which never transpired because of Myths love of leaping off of cliffs. Even though he only had 3 games in his first competitive experience, he struggled and didn't accomplish anything. He seemed to become determined, and we saw Myth continuously grind and improve his overall game after that. Fast forward to the buffs of C4, addition of clingers and other splodes, along with the nerfs to buildings in general, and it has made it hard to build and control high ground with ease. Also, bounce pads, rifts, jump rocks, and atks have made high ground much more vulnerable to being attacked from all directions. This has been an apparent downfall to Myths religious tactic of camping high in steel or brick 1x1s in the final circle. Even Daquan and other tsm members have teased myth about his 1x1 high ground camp gameplay style, which has been phased out recently.

​

With the addition of the moving final few storm mechanic, camping the late game high ground while spamming from above has become somewhat phased out due to the unpredictability and unreliability of that tactic where dynamic gameplay has taken the forefront of the competitive scene. Over time the entire community gets better by the second, and the skill ceiling continuously gets pushed to its limits. Myth's days of being the best builder are long over as his building style of 3 or 4 months ago is ancient dinosaur meteor history at this point. Many players edit as good as the best editor, and many players can gain high ground as fast as the fastest builder. Some players even have become smart enough to win engagements when trapped below in the low ground. What i've noticed is that myth really struggles with choosing the right fights. He seems to get outfragged by even console players routinely. This is because he pushes with low health sometimes , and doesn't seem experienced at disengaging. He plays numb minded and either camps or full sends, but he hasn't adapted the gtfo of there into his gameplay. This one factor is one of the reasons we always see the liquid guys in the final 10 consistently because they wisely disengage, and never overextend themselves unless a necessity. While Myth's old habits have been phased out, he's also fallen victim to the rise of the unknown beasts of players that just recently got a chance to shine in the competitive scene.

​

So where do we see Myth headed in the future? Can he rise again to being the once dominant force we saw him to be? Or will we see him fall from grace further until he decides to just be a top notch content creator? Time will tell the tale that is yet to unfold, but while we see the fall of some of the most popular players this game has had to offer, it is also time to appreciate that there are many other amazing players out there that never had an opportunity to shine until recently in the summer skirmish competitive series. A prime example of this is the current player that is the king of competitive fornite being NotVivid. A few months ago NotVivid was a no name who had no following, and has become the most winningest player in fornite to date over just this summer.

​

tl:dr Myth has adapted slower to developing metas than most of the pros, and his habitual camping 1x1 strat has been phased out. His reign as the best builder in the game is over, and the talent has caught up to him while he hasn't elevated the next level. Also, many unknown players rose through the competitive scene before they ever had a chance to show the world what they were made of. Also, many players are putting in 8 hours of scrimming, 7 days a week, and that type of commitment might not be something Myth wants to participate in.",FortniteCompetitive

I’ve reset my binds 3 or 4 times now and while I’ve arrived at a set that I’m comfortable with in pretty much every scenario I can’t help but wonder if there are a few adjustments I could make to increase my fluidity. 

As someone who’s given their keybinds quite a lot of thought, I’m interested to see what everybody else is using and more importantly, why they are using them.
If you care to share your thoughts on your binds and what lead you to set the in the first place, I’d be intrigued to hear. 
Be it keyboard and mouse position, or finger layout, it’s all the small things like these that contribute to the individuality of each player and I’d love to hear all the nitty gritty details of your configs and what works for you guys.

I feel like all these new guns with high rarity that can just kill you with barely any aim required in a battle royale setting where one single death means you move on to the next lobby is just straight up frustrating.

I'm sure most people are going to bring up the argument that I should build or keep my distance but ya kno sometimes you gotta get down and dirty to kill someone who's turtling.

Epic will be kicking things off with three Stage one heats every day, running Friday to Sunday. These will be open to the first players to register on site each day. Each heat will play a mini-series of two matches to determine placements. The top 32 players at the end of each Heat will move on the the Stage Two Nightly Qualifier for that same date.

Each evening, the Stage Two: Nightly Qualifiers will begin for all the players who advanced from that day’s Heats. The top 33 players at the end of the Nightly Qualifier will advance to Monday’s Stage Three Grand Finals.

During the Grand Finals, all players who qualified during each evening’s Nightly Qualifiers will come together in a series of matches. By the end of the six match brawl, the ultimate victor of the PAX Summer Skirmish will be Royale-ly crowned!

Stop the disrespect,"It seems like every day there's a player getting shit on but a name i keep seeing is Daequan. There's a lot of reasons for this most of them being stuff like ""dae is ass"" ""daequan is a joke in the comp scene"" ""daequan is not good enough to be a pro player"" ""daequan is not dedicated enough""  a lot of this goes along with how amazing and great team captain myth is.


Now don't get me wrong Myth is an absolutely fenominal player one of the most dedicated players in my opinion and in no way is this post meant to bring him down.


Now let's look at the fact. The fact is that dae is most definetly not the worst player in tsm. Opposite actually. He's the only tsm player with any significant placement in the skirmish and placed higher than myth and hamlinz everytime he played.


Here are the placements just in case you're too lazy to look them up


Week 2


Dae: 10th


Myth 70th


Hamlinz DNP


Week 6

Dae playing with P90princess (3 week player) 27th


Myth playing with timthetatman 30th


Hamlinz playing with melipastel 38th


Now yes these are very little stats. But they still prove a point. The point of this post is to try and explain to people that no Dae doesn't suck and no he's not a joke. If you call him a joke then you gotta call myth a joke right with him.


Lets stop the disrespect. Lets stop the ""he's the weakest of the team"" and let's view teams as what they are. Teams. Not singular pieces.",FortniteCompetitive

Epic will be kicking things off with three Stage one heats every day, running Friday to Sunday. These will be open to the first players to register on site each day. Each heat will play a mini-series of two matches to determine placements. The top 32 players at the end of each Heat will move on the the Stage Two Nightly Qualifier for that same date.

Each evening, the Stage Two: Nightly Qualifiers will begin for all the players who advanced from that day’s Heats. The top 33 players at the end of the Nightly Qualifier will advance to Monday’s Stage Three Grand Finals.

During the Grand Finals, all players who qualified during each evening’s Nightly Qualifiers will come together in a series of matches. By the end of the six match brawl, the ultimate victor of the PAX Summer Skirmish will be Royale-ly crowned!

60+% of the team drops at tilted.

30% of the game dies instantly.

One team heavily dominates the other.

If you camp you don't get kills but if you run around you get 1v2/3/4/5/6/7'd.

I get that it's a good way to practise building since the mats are so easy to get but, why not just play solo's? I already hate getting into a fight then having someone else run in and kill me, why would I want that to happen constantly?

Everyone in this sub freaks out when 50v50 isn't running and begs Epic to bring it back but I don't see what it has over normal modes. I'm not that good but still, winning or losing in 50v50 is like being a backup singer, most of the time if your team is good you're there to revive someone, down a few people and maybe get a couple of kills while your team goes 30v2 whereas another game your team dies immediately and you're left 10v30. If your lead singer sucks there's only so much you can do, if your lead singer is amazing you're only there to support them.

I don't have a problem with 50v50, I don't play it because I don't like it but I just wanna know what all the fuss is about. I'm aware that 50v50 is WAY better than final fight or even no LTM at all but the amount of posts and comments seemingly boycotting the game because it's not available is crazy to me since it's not THAT great imo.

I wouldn't be surprised if within the next 10 weeks we see store skins of the same quality, for more than 2000 vbucks.

Look at LoL. Pulsefire Ezrael for starters. Once Riot hit their stride in terms of skin design, they started to implement more premium and expensive skins. It won't be long until EPIC does the same.

Not saying it's good or bad, just came to the conclusion that its probably happening.",FortNiteBR

I've lost interest in solos duos and squads, they feel far too much of an attempt at people tryharding like crazy, full of streamers trying to prove they're the next ninja and it's sucked the fun right out of it. Even with my squad winning around 25% of games, it's lost it's fun of being something worth playing. We cant seem to goof around anymore or play for shits and giggles, everyone's trying to be a build master or streamer pro, and frankly, it's tiresome. 

But 50v50 v3 makes the game not feel so on edge crazy try hard, and while some people do go ham, it's not under insane pressure to win.

PLus the unique feeling of an out all eruption of war, and faster matches, it's such a unique feeling in Shooters.

This mode has been the sole reason I came back to playing Fortnite after stopping playing in Season3, I'm even thinking of grabbing the battlepass again because of this mode. 

The other great thing is that these matches rarely seem to last very long as well. some 10~12 minutes. Which is great.

I really hope 50v50 V3 is here to stay because it's refreshed my desire to play this game again.

It's easily the best thing added to Fortnite since I started playing in October.",FortNiteBR

Help me with some creative ideas.,"As the title say's it's my nephews 7th birthday coming up this Sunday. He has been going on about having a FortNite theme and wants to have a Nerf Battle Royale. I have some ideas to get this going but would love to hear some of the communities suggestions. 

Now I am on a budget so I can't get to crazy with what I would have to buy in, so cardboard and other materials that are cheap to free would help the best. Or items you've seen at dollar stores would be great. He does have all the Nerf guns we'll need for the party, I'm sure I'll buy some ammo packs to make sure there's enough for the fun. 

The location I'm using is a big open park with very little trees (which works out for my idea for the storm that I'll get to later) The park does have a playground in one corner which could make for a good end to a match. Just to spice it up I'm using cardboard as cover so it's not too open of a play area. Locating big enough pieces might be difficult but Walmart and big grocery stores I'm sure will have something. Even with the small boxes I can just use them as chests for ammo and grenades.

As far as power ups like chug jugs and shields it shouldn't be an issue just make a bunch of blue Kool-Aide and get some small and medium size bottles. For grenades I was just gonna get water balloons. As for boogie bombs I'm still on the fence about what to use, I'm thinking just get some foam balls from a craft store and paint them silver. If you have any ideas for items please the more the better. 

Now for the Storm I am just going to have a huge rope tied in a circle and we'll have a few adults slowly wrapping it up to give it a BR feel. I'm sure it won't matter to much having seven year olds running around with Nerf guns, but the ammo is going to be limited so they will have to use cover and reload often, I think that will keep the tension there. The adults can also moderate the battle so nobody cheats. 

As far as building goes I don't really see a good cheap way of replicating this from the game. My first thought is to have pieces of card board laying flat that they could grab and place up in areas with low cover. Maybe have some wooden dowels that are tapped to it and pop it up stick the dowel in the dirt, kinda making a lean-to. Or even more simple a piece of card board with two bends that can be popped up into a triangle. Let me know your thoughts here I would love to hear your ideas. 

I think that's all I have come up with so far. I will update this with responses I get that I think would work good in case anyone else wants to use these ideas. I will also post any videos or pictures of the mayhem when the dust settles. 

Thanks and have a great one. ",FortNiteBR

I started playing about a week ago, I mostly play Solo's because I'm not really a team player, I find it more difficult to survive and win with a squad rather than going alone. But I can't really make it in the solos either. I'm usually in the top 20-5 in solos simply because I avoid every single player I find threatening. or if I'm stuck with a gun I don't like/know well/or its just bad I'm just hiding and literally hugging the storm praying someone would have dropped a better gun for me to pick up. 

I'm super bad at building and I just feel like I never really have time to even start building when another player has build a frickin castle. And when I try to speed build even as simple thing, like a Ramp, I'll probably just fall off and/or be shot down immidiately.

I think I'm semi-okay from a medium to Long range fights, but it's not that often I get my hands on a SCAR or a Sniper. I'm completely handless in close combat fights. I don't usually drop on areas like Tilted or Loot Lake, anything that's famous for the constant bloodbath. Althought I've now started to drop more on Tilted to imrove my combat skills. 

Idk. I guess the most help I need help with is building, because I just don't 1. get it and 2. I guess I'm too slow at it. I have literally everything hotkey'd to my mouse. Idk, I'm a bonobo.

I have found myself to be against this. Let’s look at the history of how we got here in order to discuss how we got to this situation. (Skip to the last 2 paragraphs if you aren’t in a reading mood.)

Season 1: No Battle Pass 
Effort Level Required:(N/A)

Season 2: New innovative idea of Battle pass that allows players an extra daily challenge to increase battle star count. Created with need for daily playing in order to obtain challenges so that one could obtain Black Knight. 
Effort Level Required: 7/10

Season 3: Battle Pass size increased, however battle pass includes weekly challenges providing extra tiers and XP to easily reach John Wicke if all challenges are completed by end of season and reasonable level reached. This caused players to wait until the end of the season to complete challenges. This led to large portion of community receiving John Wicke and making the skin have no correlation with skill by the end of the season. 
Effort Level Required: 4/10

Season 4: In order to prevent the issue of the final skin to have a skill correlation while still allowing all players to get to final skin, EPIC creates an ingenious plan of easily allowing players to achieve tier 100 with increased battle stars, but an level based system to Upgrade the skins Carbide and Omega. While casual players could still achieve tier 100, the LED lite upgrade to Omega was a considerable challenge.
Effort Level Required: 8/10

    Which brings us to Season 5. After players waited until the end of season 5 to do their challenges, they only realized they must grind told Level 80 too late, because they left it to the last minutes to accomplish. They complained on the Fortnite BR subreddit that the challenge was too difficult or they didn’t have enough time to complete it. However, that’s what makes it perfect. Players like me that put in significant effort to reach level 80 now have a way to show to others we have put in work to the game and this was my reward. The new problem is, EPIC
listened to the complainers.
    The Season 5 upgradeable skins are now not level based, but XP based and are not locked to Season 5, so everyone who obtains the skins of Drift and Ragnarok will obtain the final upgradeable form. This strongly upsets me because the last system was so perfect and now it’s been taken away. These upgrades seem more like a chore now rather than grinding for the ability to show off your struggle and skill. 
    Anyways I’m sure you all have your different opinions. I want to hear your sides of the story so please try to start an argument and change my mind.

1. Make boogie bombs last 10 seconds and make the effects last even when they are damaged. This will be totally balanced and will not make them overpowered because the other person can do things like run, dodge, dance to counter

2. Make boogie bombs force people to dance THROUGH structures at a 3 tile radius. That'll show them.

We continue to see explosive growth of the sub! With more people comes the need for more clarity on some rules, as well as new mods!

We continue to have:

* **5 Million Daily Views**

* **750K Unique Views**

* **3000 New Subs Each Day**

[Traffic Stats](https://imgur.com/a/2lr3eKl)

*This post is to serve as a clarification of rules update. See the below for all clarified rules and statements. Note, there are no new rules being added.*

##**Meta Sub Reminder**

We would like to remind everyone that /r/FortniteBRMeta exists for any and all questions about the subreddit as a whole. Questions about the subreddit itself will continue to be removed from here.

##**Restricted Mode &amp; Feedback**

Thank you everyone who took our survey from when we went to restricted mode for Patch 5.0 Launch. Please see the initial responses below. A strong majority of you did support the action. We will look to update everyone as soon as possible on what will happen for the following patches.

[Feedback](https://imgur.com/a/jWSD7tN)

##**Sony Megathread &amp; Posts**

We've seen continued requests via Modmail and threads for allowing Sony posts so no one forgets about the lack of crossplay. Let me remind everyone of a few things:

- The Sony Megathread still exists in the rotating news banner that is just above the filters.

- Sony crossplay posts are still technically not Fortnite related, as the Sony crossplay issues also exist with other popular games, such as Rocket League and Minecraft. **THIS IS WHY SONY POSTS ARE REMOVED**. They are not related to Fortnite. Fortnite is just affected by the Sony's actions, but Sony's actions itself is not related to Fortnite.

##**Account Support Posts**

Currently, these posts are not allowed. We are allowing only support posts that are gamebreaking and prevent progression or being able to play the game.

* Example allowed post: ""I submitted a ticket to Epic because I physically cannot queue into a game"".

* Example not allowed post: ""I used my moms credit card and now hackers spent everything and now I am poor and my family and I are gonna lose our house. I sent a ticket to Epic support and no response""

##**Self-Promotion Policy Consistency**

There have been several discussion in Modmail and on /r/FortniteBRMeta about when users can advertise their social media channels in their content. This is allowed for users who currently provide a requested service to the sub. We have created an additional set of guidelines for these users found HERE. Currently, the only 2 users fall under this category, /u/stormshieldonebot &amp; /u/thesquatingdog. Frequent meme posters do not count as a service. If you think you may be able to provide a useful service to the sub, please reach out to us.

##**Mobile Content**

We have received many requests for assistance in promoting more mobile questions and discussion. Unfortunately, we do not control upvotes and downvotes, and a lot of mobile content gets lost in the mass of posts. We have added a Mobile Chat, to go alongside the Mobile LFG channel. This is to ensure mobile users have a chance to discuss and ask questions with each others.

##**Further Rules Clarity**

As always, check out the rules and wiki as we are always clarifying rules as debates come up on removed posts. Another reminder to use /r/FortniteBRMeta.

##**New Moderator Applications**

We are officially looking for new moderator applications. The reason for the delay was to ensure our 11 new mods from the last round were brought up to speed. They were only brought on around 45 days ago. Please see the below requirements for moderator applications.

* **60 Day Reddit Account Age**

* **18 Years Old**

* **DO NOT MIND MUNDANE &amp; REPETITIVE WORK**

* **Have very thick skin**

* **BONUS: Free between 12:00AM EST - 8:00AM EST (4:00AM GMT - 12:00PM GMT)**

I come from a competitive standpoint and do not agree with the recent changes that epic have made. Why get rid of double shotgun? It was the bread and butter for build fights, the competitive scene. It made so much sense, in build fights when a player exposes themselves or you open it up by outbuilding them you normally get like 1 shot off, normally with a shotgun but not with an SMG. They could've just buffed SMGS more and let players choose. The new meta (shotgun - tac smg) is infuriating. You get a pump shot then you have to use your tac sub which runs out of ammo very fast which makes less engaging build fights and creates this spam meta that we have. You win by spamming, it takes much less skill. The power weapons are the Drum Gun, Tac Sub, Silenced SMG, Minigun, C4. ALL Spam weapons. It is infuriating knowing when someone has an advantage big enough that not even the most skilled players can come back from it due to spamming. C4 is BROKEN. You get in this intense build fight which takes skill and almost always gives the win to the better play if it's fair, or you can just go the bottom and click ur mouse a couple times and get the win.

I've played 979 matches with 337 eliminations, and I've never gotten more than 4 kills in one match. I've watched the tutorials. I've put countless hours into this game. It doesn't matter, nothing I do works. 

Although I suck at pretty much everything in this game, I'd say aiming and building are my two biggest issues. When I shoot, the bullets don't land half the time. I can shoot a whole SMG clip at someone and they'll walk away from the battle with 70+ health. Meanwhile, I can't even get through a fight with more than 30. I can't even rely on making a solid first shot. 

I also struggle with building. When someone builds at me I try to counter them, but I always get outbuilt or confused and lose the high ground. I can't get the muscle memory I need to build and fight at the same time, even though I've played the game so much.

What I want to know is, what could a player like me possibly do? I like this game, but this is sucking all the fun out of it. Should I move on to something else? I've never really been good at games, but I've never been THIS bad at one. Is there some magical tip that no one ever told me?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. :) I don't know what to do at this point.

Early game people would rather spam out c4 than aim with any type of gun. Even when you build it still damages you due to its huge radius. This also means people who farm early and try utilize building are often punished because of c4.

Late game it just cancer to. Now with nade launchers, rpgs and c4 it feels like building is almost punished. Even so its definitly not a huge problem late. Its more so early game gin fights that piss me off.

My suggestion is to simply make explosives (besides clingers, hand held grenades and rpgs) do less damage to players. This would give c4 less of an impact on early game fights and nade launchers less spammable for kills. Thats just how i feel tho",FortNiteBR

I wanted to create this topic to talk about the recent weapon/building changes and to see what do others think about it. 

I myself am a pre-season player and I have played throught all the previous METAs. 
The META we currently have in the game could be called the spam META and in my oppinion it is the WORST and least skill based meta ever to hit the game. Alot of people might dissagree but I think that the double pump META was better than this.

Let me explain.

Lets take a look at building.
Curently feels really awful in my oppinion.
The building META was my all time favourite. For me it defined the game. It was something that separated good players from the average. It was something to combat the insane bloom RNG factor of AR fights. It was something what kept me playing. I always wanted to build faster and better and tried to improve all the time. Thats why the current META hit me so hard. That time I spent on practicing feels like wasted right now. The nerfs to edit peaking and gathering mats was just too harsh. Build battles ? Havent been in one fpr some time right now. And the nerfs to building arent the only thing that killed building. Lets take a look at the recently buffed weapons and the META weapons right now:

The explosives:

1. C4 - insanely OVERPOWERED and low-no skill item
One of the problems of build-battles. Just used alot of skill and mats to out-build a player ?  He is just going to blow everything up an kill you.

2. RPG - the range/radius of the explosion is insanely huge now. Who cares that you can hold only 12 rockets (13 if you count the one loaded) if just one rocket can knock down an entire 1by1 ? I know this is an unpopular opinion that might get me down voted but in my oppinion the rocket spam was easier to defeat than this thing.

3. Grenade launcher - it is still pretty powerful but I think its kinda balanced for now.

4. Stink bombs - counter 1by1 camping so they are OK but the damage is little too big.

The ""SPAM GUNS"":

1. Tac SMG - insane dps, tears down buildings insanely fast, why bother using shotguns ?

2. Silenced SMG - More acurate than AR. Why would I bother using something so heavily RNG based like AR when I can just pick up silenced SMG ?

3. Drum gun -  basicaly Tac SMG that uses medim bullets. Super RNG no skill gun.

4. Minigun - only buff that I think was good. The minigun should have been this way since its release. However now that all the other weapons above were buffed this is too much against building

5. Tac Shotgun - only viable option for close range from the shotgun class in my oppinion.

Snipers:

1. Hunting rifle - perfectly balanced except for peek shooting.

Now lets take look at the weapons that are no longer meta:

Shotguns:

1. Pump shotgun - terrible. Just terrible. Unless you hit only ULTRA clean headshots or use the Pump Tac SMG combo I wouldnt even bother using this gun. I myself used only one pump for a really long time. Even throught the first double pump meta. Deleting people required some skill with this gun. I first started using double pump when the pump damage was nerfed to no longer oneshot and when the shotgun damage to walls was nerfed. Now that you cant use double pump I use tac shotgun instead. You could eliminate the long wait time before another shot by building but as stated above, building is getting so nerfed that it wont help alot.

2. Heavy shotgun - just a bit better version of the pump. Nothing special. If you dont get headshots and dont use building you are dead.

Explosives:

1. Boogie bomb, Impulse grenades, port-a-fort - Used mostly by pros for trolling or trickshots

Assault rifles:

Unless you use Scar or maybe Famas the silenced SMG can easily outclas the assault rifles.. the SMGs are more accurate, tear down buildings faster and have faster rate of fire.
Scoped assault rifles might be the only exception for their very long range.

Snipers: 

1. Auto sniper - the other sniper rifles are just better beacose of the one hit abilty.

2. Bolt Action - hunting rifle just does better with the ability to pre-aim throught wall/peek shot.

Pistols:
 Really useles. Even the dual pistols are only good if paired with other weapon in my oppinion. SMGs simply do the job of pistols better.

Thats all for the rant about weapons and building.  Other that that I think the new vechicles and rifts are really nice addition to the game. Traps could maybe get nerfed to 100 dmg but I dont really care about it beacose I only use them to trap people during build battle. I was really excited when I heared that the game is going to ne uptaded and balance every week but right now for me the game is getting worse and worse every week, every patch.

Why do I keep playing you might ask. Well. I still love this game and I dont want it to die this way. Every week I wait for good balance change althought it never comes. Also beacose I want to complete the battlepass since I have bought it.

What do you guys think ? I would like to hear from alot of the ""OGs"". Anyways, its really late now and I spent more than enought time talking about this game. All of you have wonderful rest of the day.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve died because I’m not able to double shotgun. And before you start yelling and arguing with me let me tell you some things first. 

Ok first of all, this is meant to be a discussion about who else is finding this extremely agitating.

Second of, all no I don’t think they shouldn’t have removed double pumping, it was a problem that needed to be solved. 

Finally, yes I know that metas change all the time and I know that it’s something that is needed to keep the game fresh, and maybe I’m just really sh*t (which is probably a straight fact) but this new meta makes shotguns, and especially double shotguns (again, I’m not taking about double pump) completely non viable. I’m not just saying that shotguns are bad and SMGs are really good now, that’s only half my concern and agitation at this. The other half is just how much of the gun combos/ meta that they took away.

Anyways i would like to hear your thoughts on the new shotgun delay and if your experience issues with it as well.

Also please don’t argue with me and others, just state your ideas and act civil about it.",FortNiteBR

The whole idea that Epic was pushing was varying styles of play. By eliminating double shotgunning (especially after nerfs throughout season 4), Epic is discouraging players from picking up shotguns in general and has now (whether it be intentional or unintentional) thrown the game into a strict SMG meta. 

At the end of Season 4, shotguns had finally found balance after being nerfed and mixed in with the buffed SMG and new weapons such as the drum gun. Shotgunning alone could not win you an entire game unless you were a very, VERY skilled player. Shotgunning had found a place where good players who possessed adequate game knowledge and mechanics could manipulate the shotgunning system to outplay a less skilled player in the early-game for example, but would need more than just shotguns to win lategame.

This is too hard of a nerf for shotguns, especially considering that many pros had already abandoned double shotgunning for the most part; and by the end of Season 4, you had Tfue and others saying the only shotguns worth even picking up were the heavy and the blue tac.

All this has done is remove a skillgap that players had dedicated time to mastering, and make shotguns have much less of a place within Fortnite.

What does the community think?

She now loves playing it, she’s not very good but she has a lot of fun and now understands when I bitch about lag.
Now I have a 5 year old who wanted to try it out and she absolutely loves playing. She’s what realllly prompt me into writing this. She just played a game where she got her first kill ( the excitement from her was so pure) she finished 15th that game, a personal best for her.

Would appreciate it if you liked this post (if you agree with me) , the community can help make this game amazing.

Shotguns , smg’s and pistols : the smg’s needs a small nerfor the pistols need a buff the shotguns need  to be more precise or get a damage buff i would personally  prefer an accuracy buff.

Playground: -they should make it so you spawn with 100 armour 
-you can make a preset class
-you spawn with max mats
-you can dive all the way down.
-add bots with different difficulty settings ( i would love this!)

Ranked: i think adding a ranked game mode would be something that a lot of people would like, it would be an other thing that would keep people from getting bored. 

Explosives: i think the ammo nerf was definitely needed , but i think c4 is just a little too strong.

The semi sniper : i think this weapon is useless . It doesn’t do anything particularly better. I think most of us will take the hunting rifle and the bolt over the semi.  I think a damage buff with more recoil  or a faster ads time would help this weapon . 

The lmg: i prefer having a thompson , minigun or even a normal ar . This weapon would be a lot better if it had less recoil or better accuracy it’s not bad but i don’t think it’s good enough.

Changes to the game: i like how  they nerfed the double pump but having 1 pump against a smg is almost impossible to win.I think the  nerf to material gathering was a mistake , but i don’t think  it’s a big problem.

Glitches in the game : turbo farming is still in the game , you can still glitch through walls so that needs to get fixed but i’m sure epic is aware of this. I honestly use some of these glitch from time to time but they do need to get patched.


Honestly i just want the game to be balanced . the better player should be rewarded , not the person that got lucky because of the rng system.

And don’t get me started on bloom...

Well that’s everything i would add or change to fortnite , would love to hear what you guys would do!

First off, an asset labeled AthenaResourceRates.  


After looking through this asset I found some strings that may suggest Playground V2 will be very customizable. In this asset, I noticed strings like, ""ResourceHigh,"" ""ResourceMetalVeryHigh,"" and ""ResourceStoneLow"" I think this means you can customize the amount of resources you get when destroying objects. You can make resources very high or low. Another interesting thing I found was in 2 strings, the word Infinite popped up. This may mean that another setting could be infinite resources. ""PostInifityExtrap"" and ""PreInifinityExtrap"" Let me know what you think of this.  


In an asset labeled, GE\_SetAmmoMax there is a string that says, ""GroundGame.MaxStack.Ammo.Rocket"" and after that, ""ItemMaxStack 2 X"" this may mean 2 things...   
1. Ground Game assets are hidden in Playground and may suggest in Ground Game the ammo count is limited to 2  
2. In playground mode V2, ammo counts could be doubled, or maybe just rockets are doubled.  
Let me know what you think in the comments.  


Another asset labeled, ResourceCapModifier has some strings in the beginning linking towards the SetAmmoMax, ""/Game/Athena/Playlists/Playground/GE\_SetAmmoMax"" This might be because with this asset you can change the ammo max and resource cap? What do you think. More interesting stuff, there are strings that say ""ApplicableTeam"" ""ApplicableTeamAffiliation"" and ""bConsiderTeamAffiliationToInstigator"" This is more evidence that there will be teams in Playground V2 and maybe different teams can have different caps sort of like a handicap. No pun intended. The rest of the stuff has more refereneces to  teams and that's pretty much it for ResourceCapModifier.  


Next, a very big asset, AthenaLootTierData\_Client. So, after spending 20 minutes looking through this I found this:  
1. Pretty much every item is in this LootData: FloorLoot, All kinds of weapons, which is very interesting and I'll talk about soon, Ammo Boxes and ammo stacks, HopRocks, different types of Environments, ForagedItems, Vending Machines, Supply Drops, Llamas, something called ""MeteorDrop"" and much more.

2. After looking at this asset with a Hex Editor I found some weird weapon titles for shotguns. I found, Shotgun, PumpShotgun, HeavyShotgun, Tacticle Shotgun, and the weird one... SlugShotgun. This could just be code for a different type of shotgun like Heavy or it could mean there might be another shotgun (don't hold me on this though.) This is found in the string, ""WorldPKG.AthenaSupplyDrop.Weapon.SlugShotgun"" Put your thoughts below.

3. Another thing I found was ""Loot.Type.Sniper.Crossbow"" this might mean we could be able to see crossbows in Playground V2

4. This whole loot data could just be a modifier on the amount of loot found or it could be a setting which you can change.

""AthenaLootPackages\_Client"" is the same as the Loot data but formatted differently

""AthenaGameData"" is another big one but I just believe that it is all the settings in Playground already based on strings like, ""RespawnTime"" But, after looking through it I found interesting stuff,

1. First off, all of these settings are things that are in the game so this asset is HUGE! There are so many strings in here it is hard to know what is in the game or what is new.  

2. I found things with labels such as ""ScoringEvent"" and ""SafeZone"" which I just don't know what that means. I think the ""SafeZone"" is referring to the storm.  

3. I found things at the bottom which suggest unlimited ammo and resources but have GroundGame infront of it again, ""GroundGame.MaxStack.Resources.Wood"" and ""GroundGame.MaxStack.Ammo.Heavy"" and so on for every resource. This could mean unlimited resources.  

4. I found things that reference old quests such as, Gnomes, SkydiveRings, and center of storm which I believe is just a setting that disables the use of these during Playground mode.
5. There is a weird string that references an ""AirStrikeGrenade"" which I can't think of a grenade that does this in game because epic uses code names, but it looks like there is a TimeToBegin string and TimeBetweenStrikes. I can think of 2 things, either a new grenade may come out (I don't think this is right) or maybe there are minigames in Playground V2 because of strings like ""TimeBetweenStrikes""

The last thing I want to talk about is more basic settings I found in an asset labeled, ""Playlist\_Playground"" So this is just another settings thing I think because it references ResourceRates, RespawnTime, and InfiniteResawnExceptStorm. I did fine some interesting lines I'll share,

1. ""MaxTeamSize 8"" throughout this asset there is a lot of mention of squads and teams.
2.  I also see lots of things like MaxPlayers, MinPlayers, MaxSocialPartySize, MaxSquadSize, MaxTeamCount, and MaxTeam Size 8. This may mean you can invite more players into Playground V2 which would be a cool feature. 

Please leave your thoughts down below on what you think of this information! Can't wait to read the comments!

The whole idea that Epic was pushing was varying styles of play. By eliminating double shotgunning (especially after nerfs throughout season 4), Epic is discouraging players from picking up shotguns in general and has now (whether it be intentional or unintentional) thrown the game into a strict SMG meta. 

At the end of Season 4, shotguns had finally found balance after being nerfed and mixed in with the buffed SMG and new weapons such as the drum gun. Shotgunning alone could not win you an entire game unless you were a very, VERY skilled player. Shotgunning had found a place where good players who possessed adequate game knowledge and mechanics could manipulate the shotgunning system to outplay a less skilled player in the early-game for example, but would need more than just shotguns to win lategame.

This is too hard of a nerf for shotguns, especially considering that many pros had already abandoned double shotgunning for the most part; and by the end of Season 4, you had Tfue and others saying the only shotguns worth even picking up were the heavy and the blue tac.

All this has done is remove a skillgap that players had dedicated time to mastering, and make shotguns have much less of a place within Fortnite.

But yeah Epic nerfed the double pump, but now a single pump is still pretty bad. There was a decrease in damage, the headshot multiplier got decreased, there was equip delay, etc. All these things were added to prevent people double pumping effortlessly. People were still double pumping after this nerf. 
Then Epic suddenly decided to throw another nerf that caused double pumping to be absolutely useless. They want people to just use one pump which unfortunately is still bad considering they forgot to remove the equip delay and the damage nerf. 

This is what needs to happen:
Remove the equip delay for shotguns and buff the damage. The headshot multiplier was a good thing though, it's laughable to die from one shot if you have 100 health and 100 shield. 

Epic have literally forced us to use a shotgun with a smg. I thought they want to add more diversity and more play styles? Guess that's not going to happen if you nerf unnecessary stuff. 

You may think I'm a butthurt shotgun abuser. But trust me, I'm actually not. I just find this very confusing balance-wise. I hated the double pump as much as anyone, and I used it during my time learning the game. I moved away from it because I felt it was cheap running two of them.

I'm completely calm in duos and squads but whenever I play solos or solo squads I just can't relax.

It's so frustrating cause I know it's just a game and dying doesn't matter but I just can't help it. I even made a new account to see if I was subconsciously worrying about my main account's stats but nothing changed, I was just as nervous. My friends don't play very often and I don't enjoy playing with fills so I just have to learn how to stay calm in solos. 

Has anyone else had similar problems and why do you think this happens? Is it the lack of information? Nobody's helping you spot enemies in solos. I'm usually much more calm in the end game when I know where everyone is and I know there won't be someone behind me all of a sudden. But then again, if our squad lands Tilted and my teammates die right away, I'm totally calm when trying to clear Tilted alone despite nobody spotting enemies for me.

I want to hear an argument as to how that takes any skill or tactics to spam explosives until someone is splash damaged to death. Please change the meta back to something skillful and fun. All of the good players are pretty much in a consensus that splodes are cancer and catering to bad players to give a chance to win. ",FortNiteBR

The process to start the edit is insanely slow. On PC for example, editing is one button press away but on console you have to hold down a button for a second or so. That one second of waiting has personally screwed me over more times than I can count; editing needs to be a one button press kind of thing. And thats even if the edit starts to begin with. Half the time when you edit, the wait time bar gets filled, but then the edit doesn't even start. Another thing that is broken is your aiming when your editing. For some reason the player view will be unable to move past a certain point and you have to reset the edit in order to fix your camera. For example, if I go to edit a wall, my camera will be unable to move upwards past the editing zone on the wall. And the dumbest part about the barrier is sometimes the barrier isn't even on the thing that you're editing. It could lock you facing the sky and you wouldn't be able to go to the wall you're editing. And finally the last problem I can think of is aim assist on the editing tiles. Why the hell is this in the game? It only makes editing harder and gives you less control of where you're aiming at. It's not even weak aim assist either it fully takes control of your camera and drags to the center of a tiles. Editing has been like this since the start and a patch is LONG overdue",FortNiteBR

Let’s face it. Battle Royal games were not designed with eSports in mind. There is lots of RNG at play, and thanks to the battle royal genre, CAMPING.

We saw this with PUBGs decent into the completive scene; which lead to almost all teams holding out till the end and avoiding fights. With Fortnites building mechanics, this strategy is amplified x1000. PUBG at least had teams fighting over the best cover in the field (rocks, trees, hills etc) whereas in Fortnite no need to do that just build your own metal base all the way in the final circle.

An eSport game exists because there is a community of fans willing to watch it. No one wants to watch a bunch of pencil warriors hiding behind their preset edited walls and winning by quadruple campfire on top of a 50ft metal sky base while bandaging.

The Keemstar Friday Fortnite tournaments are a proven success with a huge audience. One week drew 8.8 million unique viewers (walking dead only drew 8+ million on 6/17 episodes last season). The reason behind its success is simple, PLACEMENT DOESN’T MATTER, only kills. This leads to extremely faced paced gameplay with tons of build fights and players launch padding straight at the enemy to avoid missing any of the action.

So why can this not work with the competitive eSports scene? Load up 100 of the most talented players in teams of 4, and set the rules to only kills matter. (Maybe an additional point for the winner of the game). So if you would like to sit in your 1x1 with your pencil out while other squads are smashing that W key like a bunch of Adderall infused crackheads so be it.

There is still the issue of RNG with this format. However, being that every player in the game is a top tier player it is massively reduced. There’s no teams getting lucky and running into a squad of 4 playing on a toaster \*cough DrDisrespect cough\*. In order to reduce RNG even more I believe five games should be played; whoever comes out on top of those five games has consistently slayed out and performed. Not out camped everyone.

This also adds a good addition of strategic play.  If your squad got fisted in the first game, you could elect to drop tilted or another hot spot in the 2nd match and try to catch up. Whereas the leaders of game 1 might choose a less populated drop, or still drop hot to try to add to their lead.

This would lead to an action packet ESports scene for Fortnite, with the best players in the game hunting each other down and launch padding towards each other instead of edit peeking.

OTHER EXPERIMENTAL IDEAS: THESE ARE ESPORTS ONLY NOT FOR REGULAR BR LOBBIES

1. To counter beginning game RNG, everyone lands with a grey pistol and 10 bullets. This would make going for the green pump on the roof interesting, as you would have to either win a pistol duel against an enemy or get lucky and hope you pick it up and get a shot off before your dead.  Either way, this gives both players a chance and not just one player grabbing the pump and blasting the other.
2. Increase the rate at which you gain resources or killing a player rewards resources. To eliminate 3rd party squads waiting till the fight is over then attacking when you’re out of materials, grant a small drop (\~50 wood) per kill. This would award your squad with 200 wood assuming you killed 4, which would give you somewhat of a chance.

TDLR: Awarding 1x1 pencil warriors in Esports is ass, award teams smashing that W key.",FortNiteBR

Currently Xbox is now technically the worst platform to play the game on, even after all the bullfuckery with Sony on Fortnite. We don't have any exclusives while Playstation does now. So, PS4 players get exclusives just for playing the game on that platform, so why not Xbox? I feel like, as an Xbox player, I am being somewhat humiliated by this for playing on the only console with no exclusives. ""Oh, look at PC with all the advantages they have since they aren't stuck to a controller,"" ""Oh, look at PS4 with their exclusive skins!"" ""OH!

Playing since Season 1 doesn't make you entitled to old skins, if you wanted them you should've bought them. Tough luck. 

Shotguns aren't broken, you just can't aim. 

The fully upgraded Omega was ment to be hard to unlock

No skin that was ever sold in the shop is OG/Rare, with proof from Red Knight; they always come back.

 Epic is trying their hardest to fix things that STW doesn't get enough love 

Building is fine where it is. 

C4 is fine where it is. 

Double shotgun sucked anyways

The skull trooper, red knight, and power chord skins aren't that good. 

No-skins should get a free skin, some actually cannot even buy the starter pack

Playgrounds v1 was overhyped

Blitz isn't the best ltm

Back then, yeah, the map was a bit spread out, and the game’s players were not as good. But it was also unique from other battle royale games, in the sense that it has the element of building, a large variety of weapons and didn’t have vehicles back in the day. It was very skill-based, as well. The players who would come out on top were the players who could build, the players who could aim and the players who could double pump well. There were four elements that began to drive this game downhill- Those were the minigun, the LMG, and a ways after, the shotgun headshot multiplier/ammo nerf, and the addition of the drum gun. During close range fights, the game no longer became a contest of who could build best or land their shotgun shots- It’s a contest of who can spam an automatic weapon the fastest. If the guns didn’t have such high damage, then it wouldn’t be as large of a problem.(The LMG doing 25-26 and the drum gun doing 27-28) They kept nerfing the skill based weapons- The shotguns, (Kicking the headshot multiplier on both the pump and the tactical from 2.5 down to 2, the pull-out time on the pump and the ammo decrease from 5 to 4.) I think that Epic viewed the double shotgun as an exploit. Again, I view this as wrong. Supposedly, the double pump/pump-tac was a technique, as is LMG-spamming. But because not everybody could master the technique of using the double pump, Epic wanted to make the game friendlier for players who weren’t as skilled as those who’d been playing since the first 2 seasons. Everyone has the ability to fire something continuously and deal out unfair amounts of damage, but not everybody has the ability to fire, switch between weapons and fire again in under a second. This is why they haven’t nerfed the LMG and other automatic high capacity weapons. Please, take away the shotgun timer, Epic. Your game is becoming too casual.

I feel like they've only done half the job when it came to tweaking them. Sure double pumping shouldn't be a thing but don't then nerf the range and damage aswell as add a delay. 

The reason double pumping was good wasn't because of they damage it was because of how fast you could shoot a 90 damage weapon up close. Take that away and you have a trashbag of a gun that is almost not viable up close anymore.

Imo they should've adder the delay but buffed the damage to all shotguns accordingly. Pumps should do 110 to the body if you hit someone with all the pellets. Semis shouldn't take more than 3 clean body shots and heavy should only take 2. Also the range on these guns are ridiculous. I understand its a shotgun but it shouldn't only be viable within 1 meter of someone.

This is obviously a massive debate in the community but this is also my take on it. I hate that everyone just sprays with a drum gun up close now it's got to be the worst meta yet. Literally takes 0 skill to push someone while constantly spraying their building down and eventually them down. ",FortNiteBR

Personally I'd think it be great considering the exclusive skin that's coming out for the PS4 bundle. It would give the switch version of Fortnite some personality to it and not some regular port. I would think that some specific amiibo would grant you a challenge list (similar to the weekly challenges in the battle pass) and would allow you to get different aspects of the figure's character. Let's say for example you had BoTW Link, you could get the Master Sword as a harvesting tool, his Hylian Shield as backbling, and Link's design for the skin. Other amiibo like the Inkling Boy would give you a skin based off the gear you would unlock in Splatoon with the amiibo and maybe an Octobrush as the harvesting tool. You could also get a trail based off some ink. The amiibo challenges may also be able to give you other rewards like Vbucks or XP boosters. I would think that the amount of amiibo challenges you could have at once would need to be limited so you don't unlock everything in a few games so I'd say about 3 amiibo challenges at once or so. Once you scan the amiibo into Fortnite, you would only be able to complete the quests on the Switch but once you complete them, you'd be able to use the accessories on all platforms. ",FortNiteBR

Epic is an good company, they just don't test things... And listen to the wrong people.

So fix Fortnite, they need to start listing to the Competitive players. They know what is good for the game, because they play it 5 hours a day.

Just check other games, like Csgo! Its still popular because its competitive, and only focused on competitive.

When i started, i sucked hard! ( I started Season 0 ) but i became better, and finally i won! That moment was amazing, i really stand up from my chair and jumped! Than i knew, i need to win more times! So i kept grinding etc.

But now.. everyone can win, its just spray and pray. There is no skill anymore, winning matches doesnt feel special anymore. 

Arena isnt good because you cant earn anything.. so why would you grind? 

Epic, and please.. this community... Try to listen to the Competitive Community..

I still love this community, the memes are amazing. But why would you wanna win on the first match off playing? Like doesnt it feel better if you had to "" train "" and finally win?",FortNiteBR

There is NO situation where a Tac Shotgun is better as it is COMPLETELY inferior to the Combat Shotgun in every way, shape and form... It doesn't have longer range, it doesn't reload any faster, it doesn't deal NEARLY as much damage, and it doesn't shot anywhere close to as fast... You can LITERALLY get two shots off and be ready for a third, before the Tac Shotgun is able to shoot two bullets... Not only that, but the Combat is rare AF. Over the 10 matches I played in the World Cup Qualifiers (Scoring 60 points btw), there was only two matches that I actually got the Combat Shotgun and was able to fight back.  


It is actually very stupid that the gun is COMPLETELY INFERIOR in every way, and should just be removed from the game...  


Potential Changes

\- Make the Tac a fucking railgun by making it fire every bullet in it's magazine at once!

\- Replace with Pump

\- Remove from game and increase Combat Shotgun spawn rates

\- Give it infinite ammo and 2x damage

\- Take out Grey, Green, and Blue Tac Shotguns and bring back the Epic (Purple) Shotgun that will be available on drop.

\- Take out the Tactical Shotgun and add in Grey and Green Combat Shotguns and increase spawn rate.

\- Replace with Double Barrel

&amp;#x200B;

Any of these changes would be perfectly fine and actually make the game much better as the game is currently a fucking shithole in it's current state.",FortNiteBR

Now I Think I Speak For Everyone When I Say There Are Definite Issues Driving People Away. 

1. Epic Games Doesn't Really Listen To The Community. There Are Some Cases Where Epic **Does** Listen To People (For Example The Live Unvaulting Event) But They Are Pretty Rare. To Fix This Epic Games Should Hire A Few People To Browse Places Like This Subreddit And Twitter. This Would See What People Actually Want In The Game To Provide A Better Gaming Experience.
2.  Epic Games Caters To The Beginners Too Much. This Can Be See In The Removal Of Syphoning, Original Drum Gun Vaulting As Well As Other Things. This Really Ticks Off Most People Who Practise The Game For Ages Just To Have Epic Games Change Everything So That Their Practise Doesn't Mean Anything. As A Solution Epic Games Should Have Stop Closing The Skill Gap And **Encourage** Practise In Gamemodes Like Playground and Creative.
3. Epic Games Keeps Changing What People Are Used To. If You've Been Playing Since Any Of The Earlier Seasons (Which you most likely have) You Would Have Probably Noticed How Much Epic Tends To Add / Remove Items And Weapons. This Does Tick Several People Off Due To The Fact That We All Have To Change Our Play Styles **Constantly** Because Of This. I Suggest That Epic Games Cuts Back On Changing Mechanics To Give People Time To Adjust To The Game.
4. Epic Games Adds Too Many Unbalanced Weapons. If You Have Noticed There Have Been Weapons That Have Been **WAY** Too OP. The Rest Is Self Explanatory. I Suggest That Epic Games Gets A Small Group Of People To Test Out New Weapons And Items BEFORE They Are Released. This Has To Be A Group Of Experienced Players With Different Skill Levels To Simulate A Normal Game Between Casual And Competitive Players. After The Few Games With The New Item, You Interview Them Via Something Like Discord Or Teamspeak. You Ask Them What Are Their Thoughts And How It Could Be Improved.

&amp;#x200B;

I Only Included 4 But There Are More Issues With The Game But These Are The Most Prominent In My Opinion. If You Have Any More Ideas Or You Disagree With Any Of My Ideas Please Tell Me Why And What You Think. I Hope A Few Epic Games Employees Can See This And Take These Into Consideration.

I get that it was OP in pubs when it first came out, but I personally don‚Äôt think it was as bad as people say. It wasn‚Äôt terribly difficult to kill the sword wielder. 

Now, it‚Äôs been nerfed a ton. No building, and the leap makes you stay still for longer after you jump. This would be fine in pubs I think but in an LTM where there‚Äôs a lot of them and everyone has epic or better loot, it‚Äôs really underpowered. The combat shotgun absolutely destroys anyone with a sword pretty easily. I still use the sword because it‚Äôs a ton of fun but it is a big disadvantage unless your whole squad has them.

My suggestions for a buff are either increase the siphon rate, or eliminate the leap freeze.

What do you think? Does it need a buff, nerf, or nothing?",FortNiteBR

I am one of the mods over at /r/paragon and was on the original mod team that started /r/fortnitebr. I didn‚Äôt even have fortnite downloaded at the time and was modding for the community. It was a real blast and so fun to watch the game explode, along with this sub!

Being a part of this community has been such a highlight for me in a really dark time in life.

Last year my wife got pregnant with identical twin boys. We were excited and terrified simultaneously. Unfortunately they had the equivalent of a car accident in the womb at 22 weeks and one of them passed away in the womb. My other son was so traumatized by the accident he wasn‚Äôt supposed to survive birth, and even if he did he probably wouldn‚Äôt live long. He was born way early at 32 weeks old and miraculously survived. They sent us home on with him on hospice the day after he was born. He wasn‚Äôt supposed to survive the first day, or the first week. When he made it to 1 month alive we realized he might be with us a while. He ended up living for 9 months, passing away in March of this year.

We were and are devastated by his loss. One of the things my counselor suggested was to find ‚Äúbridges‚Äù back to normalcy. If you‚Äôve gone through loss you know everything feels wrong and weird for a long time after loss. Then one day you‚Äôll do something and it‚Äôll feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. For me it was video games again, specifically fortnite. 

I hadn‚Äôt touched video games in ages and my wife and daughter were gone one day so I sat down and played for 4 hours straight. It felt like the closest thing to normal I had felt in weeks since my second son passed. So I did more of it. I started grinding in Arena. I‚Äôm not even that good but I kept grinding (camping) and then last week I finally made it to champion‚Äôs league. 

Today I get to compete in the world cup qualifiers for my favorite game with my favorite community. I've never done anything at this level and I‚Äôm just really feeling appreciative and wanted to say thank you to you all for being family for all of us going through tough stuff. 

My son would‚Äôve turned 1 year old this month, and to have the peak of my fortnite career coincide with that just seems significant somehow and I wanted to share that with you all. Thanks for reading",FortNiteBR

I've been playing the game since the end of Season 1 and I had pretty much given up; I honestly thought it would never happen, and I was happy to get the odd squad win. I went into a solo Arena match, just thinking I might try and get my KD up with a kill or two, and I ended up winning my first solo in 1,040 matches.

Keep going, everyone. I'm fifty years old (honest!), have no background in shooter games, play on a Mac (yes, I know) and my lifetime KD is so embarrassing I won't tell you. If I can do it, you can too.

What made the difference for me was finding a regular Discord of players I can run with, who have shown me how to improve my game - mostly by setting a good example and revealing tricks I wouldn't have thought of. And it helped that I wasn't thinking about winning the game (until the final circle, that is).

Oh, and I played on the Brazil server (200 ping) as I was told it was the least sweaty. I can't say if the people I eliminated were bots or not, but I one-shotted both of them. Probably more luck than skill, but I'll take it. God bless the combat shotgun!

I made a turtle wars map that you guys seemed to really like, and it is still being heavily used to this day [(85k views and climbing)](https://fortnitetracker.com/creative/7322-4487-0284). So I decided I'd make a storm/zone wars map and see if it was liked just as much. The map includes forced respawn to work around many of the creative bugs, and random utility/weapon spawns (essentially randomized loadout, but shotgun and AR are standard to keep it even). Check it out with your friends and let me know if there are any issues/improvements that I should address!

I will be hosting on this map later today in the Fortnite Pro League discord (creative channel) if you want to come play with me! Thanks guys!

Vaulted
- Combat Shotgun (This, in addition to the unvaulting of the Pump and Heavy Shotguns, will make shotguns more efficient: there will be the ‚Äúworse‚Äù shotgun (the Tactical Shotgun), the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù shotgun (the Pump Shotgun) and the ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù shotgun (the Heavy Shotgun.)

- Suppressed Sniper Rifle (We have decided to replace this weapon with the Bolt Action Sniper Rifle, as they are virtually similar, and a silencer on this weapon does not have much of an effect as we‚Äôd hoped.)

- Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle (This has been replaced with the Hunting Rifle, so that the range of snipers make more sense, the lowest power sniper (the Hunting Rifle) being the quickest to reload but the lowest damage and the highest power sniper (the Heavy Sniper) being the slowest to reload but the highest in damage.)

- Drum Gun (We have re-introduced two other Submachine Guns from the vault and this seems like an unneeded addition after this change.)

Unvaulted
- Pump Shotgun (Uncommon and Rare rarities only; we felt that players with max HP shouldn‚Äôt be easily killed except with a sniper and the higher rarity shotguns were disallowing this.)

- Heavy Shotgun

- Tactical Submachine Gun (rarity adjusted to Rare/Epic/Legendary; damage adjusted to 19/20/21)

- Suppressed Submachine Gun

- Bolt Action Sniper Rifle (Rare and Epic rarities; introducing the legendary rarity would be saying that this is similar in power to that of the Heavy Sniper, which is obviously intended to be the superior sniper.)

**Weapon Changes**
- Infantry Rifle Rarity Adjustments: This weapon will now be available in Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic. We felt that even though this is a powerful gun, it should not be a legendary rarity as it is underpowered compared to other legendary weapons. The weapon‚Äôs stats will remain unchanged.

- Minigun: Fire rate increased to 15. Damage decreased to 14/15 to the body and 23/24 to the head.

- Boom Bow: Recent change in 9.20 has been reverted. This weapon is now more rewarding for hitting a player: Explosion Damage decreased to 75, Body Damage increased to +25 (100 in total), Headshot damage increased to +75 (150 in total). Explosion radius slightly increased.

**Gameplay**
- Siphon: This has been re-introduced  into Solos, Duos, Squads and Team Rumble, however it now works differently. On getting an elimination, if your health is below 100 you will be restored to 100HP. If you had 100HP already, 25 shield will be granted.",FortNiteBR

We all love it but there‚Äôs something there that just makes us have a hate relationship with the game/it‚Äôs developers. So here‚Äôs my suggestions:

Vault: 
‚Ä¢Semi auto sniper (no one ever uses it)
‚Ä¢tac shotgun (too weak compared to combat no one likes it because of this)
‚Ä¢Boom Bow (Even with the nerf, it‚Äôs too strong and too easy to use)

Unvault/Add:
‚Ä¢pump or a new variant
‚Ä¢heavy shotgun 
‚Ä¢Bouncers 

Gameplay:
‚Ä¢Add ranked rewards
‚Ä¢Listen to the competitive community about competitive, it makes no sense to me why you would ever listen to casuals ABOUT competitive. 
‚Ä¢Remove shotgun pullout delay (there‚Äôs no need for it, double shotgun meta is gone and fixed)
‚Ä¢Fix loot pool/spawn rate of shotguns/shields
‚Ä¢Add customization options to let players play how THEY want. Ie. Custom crosshairs, graphic options for console (example is turn off shadows on console), uncap frame-rate on console, FOV slider.
‚Ä¢Epics defense on not adding an FOV slider is unfair. It‚Äôs not stretched, it‚Äôs an FOV slider therefore it doesn‚Äôt add motion sickness. Also, them saying it‚Äôs to add a better streaming experience for viewers is messed up. It‚Äôs how the streamer wants to play and handle their stream, it‚Äôs not epics job to step in. What about people who aren‚Äôt streaming? What if they want an FOV slider, I know I do. 
‚Ä¢Separate loot pools from competitive and casual 
    - Epics refusal to do this gives it heavy backlash and makes fortnite a laughing stock among esports. It‚Äôs no longer ‚Äúcompetitive‚Äù when you force pros to play with items that are broken in endgame. 
     -UCLA announced that they no longer have fortnite in their roster for esports games because of how much of a joke it is.

Pros: 

- I can have time to catch up with other games
- I won‚Äôt have pressure to complete challenges anymore
- I don‚Äôt have to put up with any more of my favourite guns or the only guns I use being vaulted
- my friends won‚Äôt call me gay
- my unfinished worlds in creative won‚Äôt haunt me


Cons:

- I have the season 9 battlepass
- I have save the world (I‚Äôm at the end of stonewood so I‚Äôm not too far into it to regret uninstalling too much)
- all my work since season 4 (since I‚Äôve been playing) would have been wasted
- all the money I‚Äôve put into the game will forever make me sad
- I want to follow the storyline till the end


It‚Äôs a very hard decision to make. I love save the world and I like the events that happen and I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come and I love the skins I have however the actual gameplay sucks. After the hunting rifle disappeared that just put me completely off. Any gun I‚Äôve ever liked is gone as well as there‚Äôs too many things changing and I just miss the old times. It‚Äôs become boring to play and there‚Äôs a lot of bugs with fortbytes and the battlepass so playing has become a real hastle. 

Should I keep the game till the end and constantly feel pressured or just cut it off now and miss the way it used to be?",FortNiteBR

The headshot multiplier on it isn't even 1.5, it's 1.15. If you try using it in close range, you're likely to damage or kill yourself, too.

So, as a quick disclaimer, I actually haven't really been able to try out Storm Flips, I've only found one and I just don't play very much anymore, however I've seen a bunch of clips of them in action, most notably [this clip](https://twitter.com/TakeoffsFN/status/1136605561703845888) which I'm sure many people have already seen. Just from this clip you can just see how confused the players are in the fight, which is the real storm, do storm flips flip other storms? (more on that later), and how on earth do you play around this?  

To start, I find it incredibly odd that there is not even a color difference between the Match's Storm, and a Player's Storm, and its even more confusing when you're leaving one to go to another one, as both sides of it are the exact same thing, you can't tell which is the start or an exit of one, for instance at 0:16 in that clip, the Player is attempting to run away from a Storm Flip and sees an ""opening"" in the storm to sit at, and I also thought this was a safe spot as well, but much to his dismay, it's also just ANOTHER Storm Flip zone, no indication on whether or not that area is safe or not, it's just a guess; and even when he finds a safe area, it doesn't even show you that it is one, it just looks like every other area within the Storm Flip.

Basically, change the color of a Player's Storm to something similar to our Purple, but not how it currently is, as it's the exact same. Or make it more understandable where a safe spot is or where there is not one.

Another thing that's confusing is why Storm Flips also don't flip other storm flips, It'd be an amazing counter to them instead of just being unable to do literally anything in a 8 tile radius 1-10 damage sphere. Would it be difficult to make this work? Probably not, and I don't see it creating unintentional side effects with it, however this is game development so really anything could happen.  

I don't really see any way to just play against it, all you could do is JuSt RuN lOl.  

Again, I haven't been able to personally play with it very much, but it just seems to be not very much fun of an item. I think that Epic should take it out for a while and make some improvements to make it more understandable to any user. Very glad they took it out of competitive modes for now, I'm sure players were already losing their mind over it for the short time it was available in Arena.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Fortnite has been on the Nintendo Switch for a year now (since E3 2018) and still has performance issues. This shouldn't be happening. I understand Epic wants their game to stand out and look graphically pretty, but I rather prefer a stable frame rate of 30 than ""new lighting features/brighter color schemes"".  


Tilted and Retail Row, two very popular POI's, are still the only two places, since launch last June, to have underwhelming frame issues, hitches, and overall performance. That's 6 seasons of the same problems never to be fixed. It's hard when zone reaches these locations and you're in the heat of the battle with another team. You flick your shotgun to the right and aim for the person that's next to you, your teammates are in voice chat screaming at you to clutch it. You miss because there's a ""slight delay"" and end up getting shit-talked about losing a W for the team.  


These moments shouldn't be happening. We all suffer the same problems with performance. Players play better in games that are greatly optimized for the said system. Period.

&amp;#x200B;

Every time a new season drops in Fortnite, nearly every new POI that's in the game is instantly the worst place to drop. This is bad because new players and old are curious to see what's new on the map. This isn't because it's bad in design but rather because it simply isn't optimized well to fit the player's standards. We can't have a quality experience if the game can't process these locations properly. For example: The Block, of all things, has occasional issues every time I pass by it or whether there are people around. Same goes for Pressure Plant, Neo Tilted, Mega Mall, etc.  


I hate to believe that the Nintendo Switch community is the most underappreciated group in Fortnite. We've been suffering from frame issues for A LOT of months and whenever there's a slight fix or improvement, it turns to mud the next time the game gets updated or the map gets altered in some way.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the Switch isn't as powerful as the other consoles or even mobile devices to run 60 frames, but please, make the game run at a solid steady 30 frames. Give us an update (or a 'State of Development'), let us, the Switch players, know what's happening with the game because quite frankly it seems like nobody cares.  We seem shunned from the community.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a game developer is difficult. You have deadlines and make ends meet to reach customer satisfaction. That should be every companies goal, but we've suffered long enough. I'm tired of missing shots or dying because the game decides to choke itself whenever I'm in a fight or in a build battle. It's time for a change, I prefer compromises such as lower resolution or texture quality if it means I can play the way I want to play.

&amp;#x200B;

I love this game with a passion, it's really fun, cool and one of the best third-party online multiplayer games on the Switch right now (since we don't have Call of Duty or other similar games in the online 'Shooter' genre).  I've spent about $320.00 in cosmetics, bundles, emotes and Battle Passes since Season 4 so my support in the game is there. We just need the developers' support.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Nintendo Switch players still suffer performance issues. Epic not only needs to focus on other consoles like the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 but Nintendo Switch as well. We matter too in this community.

&amp;#x200B;

Sincerely,

your beloved Nintendo Switch players.",FortNiteBR

* second win: purple guns and slurps
* third win: blue guns and big pots
* fourth win: green guns, medkit and small pots (i guess this will be the easiest)

Here‚Äôs why.","This game is no longer the one I fell in love with. Over the past 3-4 seasons Epic has repeatedly made changes that negatively impact the core mechanics of the game. 

Let‚Äôs start with the removal of the pump because this is where most of my frustration stems from. I don‚Äôt think that the high percentage of kills it accounted for is reason enough to completely remove it. The pump rewarded accuracy and patience because it you whiffed your shot you were in trouble. With the combat and the tac you might as well take any shot because you‚Äôll have another one in a half second. Lately I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôll often deal 150-180 damage to a player with 3-4 shots before they build/run away, pop minis, then I have to shoot them 2-3 more times to kill them. This makes 1v2‚Äôs or more nearly impossible which sucks for someone like me who almost never plays solos. The pump also rewarded edit plays. I‚Äôve found that with the combat and tac shotguns the player who isn‚Äôt making the edit often has the advantage because they can get that crucial second shot off first. This might not be true for pros who can edit faster and be more accurate but it‚Äôs definitely true for me. Additionally, I was far better with the pump than I ever will be with the other shotguns because I had been getting used to it for 8 seasons. Its removal, similar to how they changed the drop on bolt snipers/hunting rifles after I‚Äôd been getting comfortable with that drop for seasons, completely threw off part of my game. 

Another huge issue I have with the normal game modes is the material farming rate. Switching from Arena to play normals makes farming feel awful. It‚Äôs so frustrating that I usually just don‚Äôt do it and try to win flights with the mats I get from chests/floor loot. I also loved having health on kill in normals but I understand why they felt this was unhealthy. 

I think that majority of these changes cater to worse players. Combat shotguns allow you to miss shots and still be fine, quick edit plays are less rewarding now, the removal of old guns is better for new players who haven‚Äôt been using them since the game was released, and less materials in normals means less little timmy will get outbuilt less often. 

These changes negatively affect me in normal games where I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm better than the average player, but benefit me in Arena where I‚Äôm usually in over my head. As a result, I‚Äôve been playing arena almost exclusively this season. This was fine and dandy but unsatisfying at times because I knew I was abusing noob friendly strategies (i.e. ballers, combat shotgun spam, smg spam). But now, with the addition of the storm flip item, it is more apparent than ever that Epic does not give a fuck about competitive fortnite and I‚Äôm extremely pessimistic about it‚Äôs future. 

Now there‚Äôs almost nothing about this game I find fun anymore. Every session ends in frustration or an unsatisfying win. So I‚Äôm putting the game down indefinitely. I don‚Äôt foresee myself returning because I doubt Epic will make the changes I‚Äôd like to see (i.e. adding the pump back, increasing material farming in normals). This was one of my favorite games of all time but that game is no more and so its time to move on.

TL;DR - the game isn‚Äôt fun or satisfying to me anymore and Epic seems bent on making it worse and worse.",FortNiteBR

There are too many bot friendly weapons, Drum Gun, RPG, Boom Bow (the nerf didn't make a difference) Semi-Auto sniper, Heavy sniper!

The Heavy AR and Burst SMG spawn rate compared to the Combat Shotgun!

Rewarding the bad players of the game and punishing the good players.

Increasing the time the turret takes to overheat, even though Epic have said that hardly anyone used it... I think that's because nobody wants it in the game!

The amount of bugs and glitches in the game, not to mention that they still can't fix the game audio!

Oh and the Storm flip is absolutely USELESS in public games, and they then disable it in Arena and the World Cup, kinda pointless them bringing it to the game!

The queue system should be revamped and here‚Äôs how: 

There needs to be different levels to queuing. By this I‚Äôm saying that a regular person (like me) should not be able to queue and land instantly in match. Here is where I will lose most people, there should be a mandatory random matchmaking delay (maybe between 1 - 15) for all who aren‚Äôt content creators/streamers, and those who are streamers should have no matchmaking delay. 

There should also be a way to hide the bottom right ready button. Create a keybind or key combination that a streamer could use that maybe plays a faint sound or maybe no sound at all when queuing. 

I know my ideas aren‚Äôt perfect and maybe they won‚Äôt solve anything but I just want to maybe give Epic an idea they can run with.",FortNiteBR

I'm not saying, don't complain but it's just as important to mention the positive as it's important to mention the negative. Being only positive is bad and being only negative is just as bad. Yesterday they were multiple changes that Fortnite made yet all I heard yesterday and today is whining and crying from everyone for every little thing and i'm sick of the bad energy everyone constantly gives. People complained that we have to many snipers so they vault the hunting and in result people complain. There was multiple great changes yesterday and people don't talk about the good things that we get only the negative, the boom bow was nerfed, turret is buffed , sniper and rpg spawn rate from drones is nerfed, slip stream is more clear when it's deactivated, players who shoot or build after re spawning in the van lose can take damage again, multiple really good bug fixes and an undo feature from the item shop something that will cause Epic to make less money because players can refund things under certain conditions but regardless they added it in because they care.

Now yes maybe the flip storm is gonna be very game breaking for the comp scene but just give it time to see how it roles out, if it's too strong eventually it will get fixed in the future, not that it even effects most of you anyways since it's mainly only probably going to be OP in tourneys or sometimes in Arena. Instead of complaining to Epic and saying 'FIX YOUR TRASH GAME' or 'FIX YOUR AUDIO' tell them what's specifically wrong, you can't just say 'FiX yOuR gAmE' and expect the game to be perfect, you see a bug you report it trough the in game feedback system or at least if you're gonna post on social media to Epic tell them what specially you're having a problem with. Every time I go to Fortnite twitter and read the comments this is all I see 'bRiNg pUmP bAcK', 'LiKe iF tHiS gAmE iS tRaSh', it's so immature and unbelievable how much people are constantly complaining and crying about this game, sure it isn't perfect but if you have something to say be mature about it, that's all I gotta say, I love this game I truly do and I don't care what anyone else thinks, if you don't like the game than I don't know why you're spending over 5+ hours a day playing it, it's not like you're a streamer and it's your job to play the game, you're just living in your mum's house playing Fortnite all day and streaming with 2 viewers calling it a 'grind' and than shutting off the stream after you die after an 1 hour of playing.

Enemies should not be able to go on your side of the map (now you could make it so that team's side is vulnerable to their attacks, and its our job to not attack to let do a challenge or 2) during storm phase 1

After Storm phase 2, Slipstreams should be disabled!

Players respawning upon getting eliminated should lose invulnerability upon shooting or building (same with reboot van buff in the recent update) I'm pretty sure its a buff

That's all the hopes for changes! Please add these Epic or similar things related and continue to work hard to make this game better than ever! I will update this post with more ideas I have and you guys on reddit have Later and Good Night!",FortNiteBR

And a shotty does 120-150? The balancing in this game is so off its actually mind-numbing. It should do 115-130 MAXIMUM, if that. The weapons purpose isnt to be a dominant close quarters machine. Its purpose is to gain highground, negate fall damage, and at the same time, be viable off spawn in panic situations. Not, I combat shotty a kid for 97 and then get blasted for 187 with a Flint Knock, its ridiculous.",FortNiteBR

IMO they should've just nerfed the headshot multiplier and kept the body shot damage the same. As it stands now though this gun is better off getting vaulted.",FortNiteBR

It was a hoax.,"I have seen hundreds of references to ""proof"" or ""strong evidence"" of this comet hitting Tilted Towers on April 18th. If you are one of those people who believes that, please read the following carefully: The post that started all of that was a hoax. It was made up. There was never a hidden message in the vibrations on your controller. It was **never reproduced by anyone** that actually tried to verify the claims.

Will that comet crash land into the ground? I think it's very likely. Highly probable. But, I think so because of the movement of the comet and the fact it's gotten closer to us, the fact that Season 3 revolved around space themes, the recent addition of frequent meteor showers in the sky, the telescopes on the hills, etc etc etc. There IS plenty of evidence that suggests a crash is likely. But a secret hidden message in your controller vibration describing the date and area of the map that it was going to crash never existed. It was a troll post that people blindly believed because it sounded exciting.

30,FaZeSmasH,1524153118,8dfoce,19,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8dfoce/falsely_banned/,0,Falsely banned.,"Edit: sorry for the long read but I have to lay down everything so everyone can understand.

Like the title says I was falsely banned on fortnite. When I try to log in it says my account is disabled. 

I believe this happened because battleye detected an injector I was using to mod in GTA 5. If anybody doesn't know, GTA 5 is a really huge grind if you want to buy stuff and I can't do this since I play fortnite and CS:GO and these games are a huge grind.

Anyways I forgot to close the injector and I jumped into fortnite. I started playing a match but got kicked saying I was using a VPN/Proxy or cheats. I was using a VPN since where I live spotify is not allowed so I have to use a VPN. I closed the VPN but still got the error. So I restarted my PC. Wasn't getting the error any more so I didn't care anymore. Next day I'm greeted by a ban. Battleye probably detected the injector since its a famous injector and fortnite cheats use them probably. 

I contacted epic support via email and I explained exactly what happened (or I think what happened). I got a reply saying I was ""observed"" using cheats and that it was a permanent ban. I told them to show me any proof that I was cheating. They said they can't since they want to keep the AC stuff a secret and I understand. I then asked them to check my prior matches but I doubt think they did. Instead I got a reply saying bans are not handed out unless it's ""rightfully warrantied"". 

I also PM'd a dev on reddit but didn't get a reply. 

If a epic dev sees this, please look into this properly. I have not cheated and saying that I have been observed as to be cheating and that my ban is rightfully warrantied is not what I should be getting as answer or any other player who has been falsely banned. Look at my stats, I haven't won a single game yet. The highest i have been placed was 2nd. Look at my shot accuracy and all that. 

As a person who plays csgo and has seen how bad valve has been screwing CSGO over I loved epic but valve hasn't falsely banned anyone. If so they have been unbanned. Hopefully this can be sorted out.",FortNiteBR

33,MrPopoTFS,1524152374,8dfkwh,375,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/8dfkwh/corrupted_replay_information/,1016,Corrupted Replay Information,"Heya,

We've been seeing some confusion around ""Corrupted Replays"" today so I figured I'd drop in and clarify some things.

As of now any replays that were saved in a previous update will not work once a new one is released.

Example:

* A replay saved in v3.5 will not be watchable in v3.5.1

However, in the future, we are working towards making replays work for the entirety of each major patch. This means that your replays would work until we have another major patch, which is usually every two weeks.

Example:

* A replay saved in v3.5 will work in every v3.5 version (v3.5.1, v3.5.2, etc) but will be unwatchable once v3.6 releases.

So for the time being keep this in mind when planning your editing sessions and keep creating and sending us your Epic Fortnite submissions to the #ReplayRoyale contest!",FortNiteBR

Was an actual pro in CS1.6.  FPS was my shit and I was very good at it.  

As I grew up, I switched to PS4 because it allowed me to stream movies through my TV and play video games more casually with my real life friends (who aren't really gamer nerds like I am).  

NBA2K - Rocket League - Overwatch ... These games were all fun for me and I never thought about PC or missed it really...

Until Fortnite.  Fortnite is the first game that has brought back that insanely competitive feeling I used to get when I'd compete in CS 1.6 tourneys &amp; leagues.  I play a lot online with my PC friends (loving the cross platform, bravo EPIC) - and I compete against basically all PC players.  Needless to say I am at a major disadvantage, yet I still hold my own (Average of 6 - 8 kills, a few wins a night).  That's basically IQ though and understanding my disadvantages, when it comes to build-offs and shotgun/sniper battles, I tend to shy away when against PC gamers for obvious reasons. This leads me to the point of my post though... 

**I want to fucking murder everybody in this game and I feel that I could**

Now, I have moved out, and really just use my work laptop when I need to get on the Internet.  I do have my old PC and I could more than likely run Fortnite (perhaps I need to upgrade my gfx card).  I'd also need to go out and buy a desk for my PC and an extended ethernet cable, but this could all be done and I could be on Fortnite (PC) in half a day.  The conflict is in that I don't really want to spend the time &amp; money setting up and getting the PC up to snuff if it isn't worth it.  

Has anyone on here made this switch? Has it been worth it? Is it really that much better? Have you become MORE addicted since switching to PC? (cause I can't really afford to get sucked in either) - Just looking for some advice from the community since I am sure I am not the ONLY person who has considered switching to PC.  

TL;DR - Ex PC gamer now 28 and casually playing Fortnite on PS4 having urges to update old PC and buy desk/setup to play again.  Afraid of wasting time/money. ",FortNiteBR

now i know people will be angry about me ranting about 100 v bucks so let me explain

Im a f2p player of fortnite for about a year now and the only purchase ive made was the starter pack because i was amazed at how cheap it is so it gave me 600 vbucks + all of the free v bucks i got on the free pass = me buying the Season 4 battle pass but fucking epic games wont let me do that 

damn i saw some people recieving a message that gives them 20x starts shit epic didnt send me any and just advanced my tier and i didnt get the v bucks 

damn i want to buy the season pass of season 4 but it looks like i have to skip and buy the season 5 because i will miss some days

A lot of you were angry because they are ""Limited edition"" and now they are just bringing them back. Now I can say that ofc they would bring back the skins one way or a nother the next valentines day with some new ones so I see no problem with returning them to the shop. Now another thing is how other event skins like halloween or xmas did not return, I myself didn't get the nutcracker and I'd like to get him now.

I don’t know if my friends and I are the only ones that feel this, but judging by the direction the game is going, I feel that Fortnite devs are trying too hard to cater to new players.

Let’s put this into context. Let’s say you’re double ramping up to a player, and suddenly, a metal base comes up in your face. You try to adjust and build around it, but no, LMG and Minigun shred through all buildings. You start to barricade your stairs, but the player and his new found first shot accuracy with burst rips through your head in a second.
You see what I mean? I know you guys are just going to say things like “git gud” “lul you’re just a noob” “lol butthurt scrub” but no. I’m serious.
With no building fights, what’s the fun in playing anymore? I understand skill based matchmaking has been implemented and y’all are gonna say I’m trash so I’m matched with people of similar skill levels but I at least want an entertaining fight, not some bullshit with RNG.

I have a new challenger to the Tilted Towers meteor theory. Instead of the meteor hitting Tilted, it will instead hit Loot Lake. If you use the translated Morse code, it will say SOS D5 418. Let's start with D5. If you were to convert D into a 4 and 5 into an E, following the A1Z26 cipher, it gives the coordinates 4E. The coordinates are smack dab in Loot Lake. If you were to also use the A1Z26 cipher on 418, it equals DAH. What places have these initials? Dusty Depot, Anarchy Acres, and Haunted Hills. If you were to find where all the towns meet together, it would be straight at Loot Lake.
My theory?
The meteor will hit Loot Lake, cause a large explosion, and either create a new Tilted or a new Loot Lake. Loot Lake has been notoriously known for having terrible loot. Given with the large surge of suggestions for Loot Lake, Epic might retcon Loot Lake and put an entirely new location in its place.

TL: DR Using A1Z26, the morse translation shows coordinates to Loot Lake, suggesting that the meteor might hit Loot Lake creating a better, loot filled location or cause an explosion hitting Tilted.",FortNiteBR

And now comes the worst: 
After today's update this game has become literally unplayable (no meme intended). I'm constantly teleporting around as well as all the other players around me. I really enjoy this game, but weird connection glitches like this make this an absolute terrible gaming experience...

An Original Song
He gets on with life as a John Wick,
	He's a Skilled kinda chap.
	He likes Looting on Sundays,
	He likes Killing in the week.
	He likes to contemplate Scars.
	But when he starts to daydream,
	His mind turns straight to Snipers.

	Boom boom shake da boom-boom-boom! 

Sometimes I look at him and I look into his eyes,
I notice the way he thinks about Snipers with a smile,
Curved lips he just can't disguise.
But he thinks it's Scars making his life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for him to decide which he loves more?
Scars or...
Snipers?

He likes to use words like 'Where we dropping boys?,'
	He likes to use words like 'BUILD!.'
	He likes to use words about Scars.
	But when he stops his talking,
	His mind turns straight to Snipers.

	Boom boom shake da boom-boom-boom! 

Sometimes I look at him and I look into his eyes,
I notice the way he thinks about Snipers with a smile,
Curved lips he just can't disguise.
But he thinks it's Scars making his life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for him to decide which he loves more?
Scars or...
Snipers?

He likes to hang out with Rust Lord,
	He likes to kick back with Dark voyager,
	But when left alone,
	His mind turns straight to Snipers.

	Boom boom shake da boom-boom-boom! 

Sometimes I look at him and I look into his eyes,
I notice the way he thinks about Snipers with a smile,
Curved lips he just can't disguise.
But he thinks it's Scars making his life worthwhile.
Why is it so hard for him to decide which he loves more?
Scars or...
Snipers?

He's not too fond of Rust Lords,
	He really hates Common Guns,
	But he just thinks back to Snipers,
	And he's happy once again.

I'm close friends with an Epic dev and got the inside scoop. The meteor was originally created to compliment season 3's space theme, than a lot of hype and theories grew around it so they decided to incorporate something similar to what H1Z1 had and they came up with the idea of creating ""impact"". It'll be a LTM where meteors will consistently fall and break down buildings and structures at random times outside of the circle (not storm). As the circle gets smaller, meteors fall faster and in bigger numbers on the outer circle. You can call it a ""semi-safe zone"" I guess. Idea was to create a higher density within circle at earlier times of the game in hopes of more action and faster gameplay. Honestly loved the idea.

I mean the title speaks for itself.

I also don't understand how now people are complaining that something that was never confirmed to be happening by the developers, didn't happen. How can a developer be blamed for not doing something, they never said they were even considering. It was only ever ""confirmed"" by clickbait YouTubers taking advantage of an young, impressionable teenage audience, with adults then believing the nonsense. 

You can't make this stuff up, even if you tried. This same YouTube clickbait nonsense happened in GTAV, happened in COD, and now this cancer, it is has spread to this great game. Just stop believing dumb conspiracies from now on, and listen to the developers and the developers only, and maybe we won't have these problems. ",FortNiteBR

I see the common complaint that everyone is dead before the 2nd circle which is why Tilted Towers is bad and I understand that but it does not make sense at all. This is the kind of game Fortnite is, whoever gets the guns first at the beginning wins. Let's say tilted gets removed, and somehow another 'Tilted Towers' isn't chosen and everybody spreads out across the map, does everyone realise there will be basically the same number of deaths early only this time maybe spread out more across the map? Yes you might get 1\-2 more kills early on \(if anything\) but in the end removing TT wont magically create a final circle 100 alive.

Some players were not able to accept this from a free game that is in beta. Madness ensued, minds were lost, and all the entitled went on social media to demand reparations.

There was an old saying i heard as a child, the squeaky wheel always gets the oil. Never in my life has this been so true as it's been lately. As awesome as Epic is, they are quick to bend to social media pressure. Free backpacks that you'll never use, and free Battle Pass Stars with 12 days left in the season. Notice also that the stars only benefit those who purchased a battle pass.

These Battle Pass Stars are only benefiting the players who most likely weren't affected by this outage. The casual players are mostly the only ones who need 20 stars. Most hardcore players, which were the 1's most upset with this outage, are finished or on the doorstep of finishing their battle pass. John Wick is everywhere. As much as i feel Epic doesn't need to do these things whenever they have a hiccup in their beta, this just makes no sense. The backpack is whatever, most will claim it most will never use it.


TL:DR - This game is a beta and we are all the testers. They shouldn't need to bribe us with goodies if they have a hiccup, but if you want to be fair in rewarding players - Issue a few V-Bucks so we can grab something we need/want.

After the 100 players are in the server, Assign a ""seed number"" to each player/team before the bus loads up. This would be cool because you can tell how strong the team that you wiped out was.

Maybe once there are 10 teams remaining it could display on the UI the remaining seeds of which teams are alive.

It might add a little more to the game if you and a buddy are seeded 28th in duo and there are 3 teams left, one being the 2 seed and another being the 6th seed. It would give the win slightly more meaning as you were the underdogs.

I don't know how easy this could be implemented, but it would make the game a little more exciting I think.


Edit: it doesn't need to match high skill players with high skill, it would literally just be an indicator for where your skill falls in relation to the rest of the match.

The battle Pass is a really cool feature of the game. Most of the skins are awesome. And most of the players were grinding from day 1 to have that John Wick skin.

One way to improve the Battle Pass would be to add an element of mystery to it. Every tier's reward is hidden until you unlock it.

You would grind without knowing exactly what you would get.

One might argue that spending 10 quid without knowing what you're buying isn't the smartest decision, but 10 quid for a bunch of epic/legendary skins and emotes would still be a bargain.

Seeing as we have opted to not yet make any official announcement about 500,000 subscribers, I felt the need for at least one moderator to still at least acknowledge it. From my time spent on /r/paragon, I never thought I would be apart of a subreddit that has grown (and continues to grow) so fast. The next few months for Fortnite will be important, as the game evolves to further cement itself in all our lives. Let's all make sure we keep helping make a better game for everyone!

For better or worse, we have truly become something greater than the sum of its parts (that's all of us). I'm glad to have seen the great one-upping of creativity, and the spam of garbage created by things like the glider meme (Memes are great in moderation).

The industry has truly never seen a community and developer so engaged as they are here. I'll always enjoy reading all the great suggestions you guys make.

Here's to another 500,000 more of you ""game development experts"" (I love everyone, please don't hate me)! I'm sure you'll see a more official announcement in the future.

(or even the biggest one ever!!),"There has been a lot of hype around 3.5 content update lately and I am pretty much sure that it is one of the biggest FNBR update ever due to following reasons

* We haven't received any info. About tomorrow's update (Except deploy time i.e. 0800 GMT). Not even LMG reveal trailer. Which could mean that Epic doesn't want to spoil the update for us.

* Downtime for content update. They said us a few weeks ago that there will be no downtime for content update but this time there is a downtime. In the 12th April apology letter they even said that there will be EXTENDED DOWNTIME.

* The update size in last previous weeks were pretty big. Some might say that it was due to Replay System but Epic add game files a few weeks before the update. 12th April update size was even bigger than the 18th Jan Map Update.

* Meteor pieces started falling today and scientifically this is called fragmentation and it only happens when meteor enters Earth's atmosphere. Which means that update is pretty close. And this might be the last bit of teaser we will get.

* ""Take the L"" in meteor sound spectogram. It means that Epic is intentionally teasing us.

Note that it is just speculations and No one (Except epic) knows what is going to happen.

1. Apparently everyone forgot what Pleasant Park, Retail Row, and Greasy Grove were like before the map update. Tilted towers has not changed the game pace no matter how much you think it has. [This is a video from 7 months ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgvQJljVCSE), when Dakotaz got his first win. In this same video [when the first circle is fully closed](https://youtu.be/FgvQJljVCSE?t=13m24s) there are 28 people left. This was in the very early days of the game when even less people dropped in named locations than they do now. People had terrible aim, couldn't build, but the important part is that the game pace is the exact same, and is not a reason for Tilted to be removed.

2. A comet doesn't stand still for a month before doing crashing down in an instant. If they wanted to blow tilted up there would be more noticeable changes to it over the course of it's life span to make it more obvious.

3. The Morse code thing that was posted on APRIL FOOLS day was fake, and the fact that everyone fell for such a shitty April Fools joke should be embarrassing, and anyone with a controller could confirm that the vibrations didn't fit any of the patterns. There has been no sort of hint that the target for the comet, if it is even a comet, is headed for Tilted.

That's where the end of the evidence is. I think the event is part of the season, and following what's been showing up in the shop, the comet is actually a UFO that is going to land somewhere on the east side of the map, and the wah-wah-wah stuff coming from it is a wavelength coming off of the ship. However, the comet is also in Save the World, and is not part of the event, which could mean that either it signifies the F2P advancement of STW, or it's going to provide story for Battle Royale.

TL;DR, Tilted isn't going to be destroyed because everything you've been parroting about it is false.",FortNiteBR

Everyone has heard of tilted towers, whether or not they’ve played fortnite. While it may be healthy for the game for it to be gone, that once iconic location will be gone, and also, potentially its legacy. I feel like logging on one day, looking at map and not seeing tilted will rip a part of my love for the game out. Not only is it iconic for the game its kind of a joke also. Its fun to make fun of tilted towers and how insane it is and how many people go there and everything but when its gone whats going to take its place. I feel like jokes with retail row or pleasant park instead of tilted wont be nearly as funny. 

I would be fine with tilted gone as a named location, but we need something to remember the legacy. Nothing removed so far has had such a huge legacy and had been so closely linked with the game itself. It may just be me thinking too much about it, i just wouldn’t know how i would feel if i woke up and tilted wasn’t there.  ",FortNiteBR

-make the rocket deal much more damage to building, but a lot less on players. I think it’s not as effective as the other one but it could help.

I have reason to believe the following is in place: Season 3 will be the last. The meteor will destroy the current map, and the game will go offline. The Epic team has faced adversity for quite a while. They have created a monster they can no longer control. Their servers can no longer control the volume. They have taken loans out for new servers, but is expanding too rapidly to keep up, hence the lag.  Instead of throwing in the towel, they look at other opportunity. They negotiated a deal that will become known as a video game monopoly. The current epic employees contracts are being bought out by Microsoft and PUBG Corp, hence the SOS distress signal. When you load up Fortnite in 5/1/18, there will be a massive download (52gb), and you will be directed to the new game, PUBG. You will be forced to play PUBG, and Fortnite will only exist in our memories.

I met you on the dance floor. You were unarmed and I had an extra gun, so I gave you an AR. I expected you to shoot me, but you didn't. From that moment, I knew we had a connection. I had two large shields and I gave you one. We set out together to escape the storm.

We rolled into Tomato Town and got some loot, but as I was rearranging my inventory, somebody took a shot at me. I was taken by surprise and almost killed, but you saved my life and gave me a medkit to patch up. We danced together, then continued away from the storm.

As we hiked, a sniper shot rang out, and you were suddenly struck down by my side. You were taken from me just when our joy was the greatest. I built cover and checked to see if I could catch your username.

I thought it said ""elieenk."" But I keep trying to add you as a friend, and it says there's nobody by that name.

The main reason for this is because 1 shotgun causes major inconsistency, which I can bet all of you have experience (sub 10 damage and sub 20 to the head). Pump gave much more consistent damage and 2 made it so the dumb reload time wasn't an issue when you would get low/ inconsistent damage.

Recently i have a lot of stuttering in fortnite and it is really annoying, is there any fix for that? some drops go down to 40-50 fps which cause an insane amout of stutter and makes the game unplayable

I am playing the game on my laptop
i7 7700 hq

gtx 1060 6gb

16 gb ram
 
game installed on 512gb nvme


I am playing on a 1440p 60 hz monitor and set the 3d resolution to 100%, render distance to epic, and other settings at medium

v-sync was turned on, i tried removing it, removing the 60fps cap and change it to 120, but no success. i also tried lowering every settings to the minimum or off, as well a the 3d resolution to 1080p but it is impossible to get a stable 60fps

i disabled the windows game bar, no change

i always get drops to 40-50

Am i the only one in this situation? have you guys found any fixes?

thanks a lot",FortNiteBR

However, most of us agree that it did many things right.   Such as...

1.  It was fun to use.  Driving an RC rocket is simply fun. 

2.  It was fun to rush an unsuspecting Guided Rocket player (if you were successful and got in his/her grill)

3.  It was fun to shoot it out of the sky.  (Just too difficult)

4.  It was fun to see a Guided Rocket zooming around in the sky at a distance.  It made the battlefield feel different and unique.

5.  It sounded cool and was aesthetically beautiful to look at.

6.  It was fun (and easy) to rocket ride with.

7.  It lowered the skill floor which is always a good thing.

I've seen a few posts in r/all and now a bunch of my friends are trying the game right now, so I was wondering about trying it too, but I had a few questions.


I tried the Battle Royale mode 1 or 2 weeks after it got released. I had only played H1Z1 then. Tried a few games alone, found the gameplay kinda clunky (couldn't use my mouse to switch between weapons, but I think this one's my fault), and the map fairly empty, so I stopped. The fact that my PvP FPS aim isn't the best didn't help either.


But now, I feel like there has been a bunch of updates that added a lot to the game. I'm considering giving the game another try after my first ""meh"" experience.


- Has the controls gotten more fluid / gameplay become better ? I've seen a few clips of people switching rapidly between weapons and building really fast : do you use key bindings for this ?


- Talking about bindings : do you recommand bindings certain items or construction blueprints on certain keys to be faster ? F1 ; F2 etc... Doesn't seem that ergonomic.


- Is there really more fun and better in a squad than alone ?


- Are there traps or pitfalls that a new player should know to avoid ?


- What are some good habits to pick up while playing, or things to check regularly ?


- Do you have any other advices that might help a bunch of newbies ?

Well he wasn't too pleased, he didn't care, but he wasn't pleased because the Chomp Jr. came out 2 days later.
Keep in mind multiple of our friends asked for a refund of their vbucks for accidental buys and they got the return no problem, so my friend decides he's going to give it a try because he really wanted the chomp Jr. So he made an appeal for a V-buck return and waited. The next couple of days he got a reply, and it's not the reply he was looking for. My friend was banned for ""Miss-Use of the game"" for accidentally buying one of the worst pickaxes to come out in the item shop and asking for a return of Vbucks... He didn't even care that much, in fact a simple no would've been fine, but banning someone for simply asking for a refund is absurd, plenty of other people have done it so if you're going to ban people for asking for refunds then ban everyone who has done it and used it against the system, not people who have spent over $790 on your game and also bought a founders pack..... I hope a Dev sees this.

As someone who can’t play the game until the end of the day, but still enjoys browsing through reddit, it would be be really cool if the mods could some how implement an auto post removal system so players like myself don’t have the moment ruined by people wanting to be the first players to post to reddit.

If nothing ever happens then obviously it doesn’t matter but if tilted is given it’s rightful death, KT extinction style, than it would be so much cooler for the fanbase to experience it themselves instead of it being spoiled by a some karma addicted reddit user.

In case anyone was wondering, the exact same object is in the sky in Save The World, and it is transmitting communication. 

if you'd like my theory, I dont think wont happen today either, it will probably most happen at the end of the battle pass season, which will correspond with the end of the current event quest line in Save The World. I personally think Lucky Landing is getting landed on (irony) and replaced by an alien space craft-- not so lucky after all. it was a season event place to begin with for Chinese New Years, and i can easily imagine all the treasure towers being replaced with alien towers. it would change the landscape for a season and keep things fresh. this sets up a battle pass with alien skins that allows a for theme of astronauts vs aliens on the field 

I would like to see the following season battle pass after that be themed with zombie and post apocalyptic road warrior type skins. now thats a story arc over the course of multiple battle passes that requires no verbal in game explanations, which would be pretty cool, imo. BUT HEY, THAT'S JUST A THEORY, A GAME THEROY!

But seriously, play Save The World, because you're missing a lot of details about the object in the sky and how it's sending communications. And to all the people freaking out about the poster that supposedly has a picture of tilted towers on the earth inside that bedroom: show me that alien bridge in tilted towers with laser beacons on the top of it please, because there's not one structure in tilted that looks like that. if we want to talk posters, go to flush factory and dance a bit on the disco floor while eating your heart out staring at the poster with an alien on it while it stares right back at you.﻿",FortNiteBR

The meteor will be hitting soon. What if it didn't only hit tilted, but instead got rid of multiple places. Take a look at the weekly challenges:

Week 1: Search chests in Pleasant Park
Week 2: Search chests in Wailing Woods
Week 3: Search chests in Junk Junction
Week 4: Search chests in Flush Factory
Week 5: Search chests in Moisty Mire
Week 6: Search chests in Anarchy Acres
Week 7: Search chests in Lonely Lodge
Week 8: Search chests in Snobby Shores

It is not wrong to argue the fact that these places are some of the least visited places on the map, and the challenges might just be in place to make people visit these for the last time. The meteor may be an excuse to remove these, and do a map overhaul. So it is safe to assume that, one of the next two weeks, will be search chests in Tilted Towers.

It would create some overlap between shotguns, as SMGs can never be powerful enough like shoguns, but also can't be too weak. It's tricky to balance.

If white and Green shotguns are removed from the game, making Blue, Purple, and Orange the only shotgun variants, SMGs can fill the void left by them.

This reduces the amount of shotguns, but in their place, SMGs get a more prominent role.

Shotguns are still powerful, but this comes at the cost of making them a rarer. Missing with a shotgun can be costly if SMGs are powerful and consistent against players, so they would balance out.

This would make both pistols and SMGs great weapons for CQC, but would make shotguns more special, should you find it",FortNiteBR

I simply don't know what to do, and was hoping you guys could help me.

Okay so, as the title states, on day one of stats release, there was a 10ish hour period where stats were disabled but Epic tweeted saying anything that happens in that period would backfill. I got 3 wins during that period, and many other games played (I played nearly all day that day). Each of my wins were 10+ kills, so I was really excited to see that on my stats, giving a bigg jump to my overall killcount to 'games played' ratio. Unfortunately that entire day of playing was never added to my stats page. 

I've tried reaching out to Epic on twitter, I've tweeted them 3 times, and DM'd them once, no response. I then tried to send an email to their support, no response. All of this happened at least a week ago, that's a long time, I figured I would've heard back from them by now, but I haven't. 

I don't know what else to do, if they only ignore me, than I have no idea how to get my problem resolved. Does anyone know what I can do? I really want those games to be added to my stats page.

""[Regarding changing weapons to projectile based] This is a good way to get most of your players to quit when they realize the shooter gods are unstoppable. I think what people liked about fortnite BR is that it felt fair. Take away hitscan weapons and make them projectile, the best shooters will stomp every match much more often then they all ready do. The casual/average gamer definitely doesn't want projectile based weapons for everything. To do a 360 like this would get a good portion of people to just stop playing because the game won't feel the same. There are better ways to deal with ridiculous bloom then making all the weapons projectile based. Players won't want to relearn how to shoot after spending so much time with the game as is. It'll be a frustrating experience that pushes people away. They need another solution at this point, or just ruin the games future.""

This. Very much this. I LOVE the hitscan weapons. Honestly if the first shot were a tiny bit more accurate I think the gunplay would be perfect for me. As it is, I really have no other complaints.

I love the insane bullet drop sniper. It takes so much more skill to hit someone moving at range with a sniper and I LOVE IT!

Fortnite is insanely fun as it is. Making the non-scoped weapons projectile based would honestly make it so much less fun for me.

Recently Epic announced a series of upcoming changes, one of which is changing all currently hit-scan based weapons to be projectile based. Personally I find this decision quite odd when considering the cost / benefit.

For one, the hit-scan based system doesn't seem to be an issue for many people. I can't recall anyone on the subreddit complaining about it, as opposed to some of the other aiming related mechanics that are also being addressed in the future.

Going fully projectile based will fundamentally change the way you shoot at mid / rong range. But to what benefit? The hit-scan doesn't seem to create any imbalance or randomising factor, whereas the projectile based system (at least as I understand it.) is also slightly more susceptible to lag related issues.) It would also mean that veteran players will have to suddenly change the way they have been aiming from the very beginning, again, with seemingly very little benefit to the overal gameplay.

I'm inviting everyone who can see a more positive / competitive side to this change to leave a response here. I'm genuinely curious what some of you see as the positive side to this change, because I really don't see the benefit, as opposed to some of the other aiming changes that will be made down the line.",FortNiteBR

The 2 second lag spikes that were pretty common 2 weeks ago, have turned into 4-5 and sometimes 8 second lag spikes. It's not just me either, as everyone in my party was also experiencing some type of lag. 

I suggested bringing back the lobby wait time, potentially to help the map load in a little bit better, but to no avail. 

This game was beautiful (still is) when it first came out because it didn't have the LAG/FPS random drops that other new games seem to struggle with. I understand that with more players on the server, means more problems, as far as performance goes, but still, there has to be some sort of solution.

I see dev update #2, but then I see no mention about the lag spikes that console users are experiencing, so it could be possible that the devs are just currently unaware of how bad it actually is. 

Is anyone else experiencing these problems? 

EDIT: By bringing this topic to EPIC's attention, we might be able to help them notice just how big of a problem it really is for everyone. This needs to be the FIRST thing fixed.

**Sorry for wall of text, I don't know how to make this look pretty and I tried to provide lots of info**

For the first week or two I played FNBR I enjoyed 80 (on the low end) to 120 (capped here for stability)FPS on my 144hz monitor while on maxed settings, and now the last week or so I get unplayable values of 30-40FPS dropping to **below 10** when moving or fighting (which is kind of when the FPS is important). 


I have tried **EVERYTHING** I can think of:

1) Changing to lowest graphics settings.

2) Turning individual graphic settings to differing values to try and isolate an FPS drop.

3) Ran hours of torture test on my CPU to ensure no issues there. (Prime95)

4) Ran tests on my RAM to ensure no issues there. (Memtest86)

5) Made sure my video drivers were up to date.

6) Tried older video drivers.

7) Checked temperatures (CPU/GPU) to ensure they were within safe values.

8) Reinstalled Fortnite.

9) Clean install of Windows.


Whether I'm on Epic or Low, or anywhere in between, when this happens (which is at least a few times a day - every other match or constantly some days) I still drop to unplayable FPS.

Fortnite also seems to use a lot of CPU compared to my friends with equivalent machines (40-60%+, even when this isn't happening and I'm getting my expected FPS) which is weird but honestly shouldn't impact performance until much higher CPU usage. (and again my CPU passed the torture test with expected values/times and zero errors, so I'm confident this is the game and not my CPU).

Other games, most recently Shadow of War, can be run at Ultra settings with the Ultra HD textures pack and still maintain a minimum of 80-90FPS in high stress situations.

Fortnite is the **only** game I have issues with and its also the game I've been wanting to play most so I would love any insight anyone may have into this!

As an aside, my **wife has an almost identical PC** to mine, same GPU, same monitor, same SSD, with a slightly worse CPU [i5-4690K (not overclocked or anything)] and **things run fine** (80ish to 120ishFPS) for her on epic settings (as they should).

Any help would be appreciated, sorry for the massive post but I wanted to put in all the info I could think of!",FortNiteBR

Well, this particular game all 4 of us landed in the factory zone outside of Dusty Depot. No other teams were around us, so looting the place was easy. I already had a scoped AR so I decided to drop my grenade launcher for our 4th. 

As we're mining, I hear two grenades go off. I turn around and our teammate had just blown himself up with the launcher 🤦‍♂️, no other teams were around us. Anyways, I go revive him because accidents happen. Hell, I even drop him a stack of bandages to heal up. However, instead of healing up, this guy just up and runs the complete opposite direction from us without healing.

So, our team made the executive decision. He had to go. A few pops from my AR, and we recovered the launcher. Our team headed out to the next zone in silence for the crime we had just committed, but it had to be done haha.",FortNiteBR

One thing that I love is how inaccurate most of the weapons are - and that's not sarcasm. The first time I dropped into a match, picked up an assault rifle, and saw the size of the crosshairs the first thing I thought was ""awesome, I'm probably not going to constantly get mapped by campers.""

So I think the weapon cones and bloom are something that encourages ""fun"" gameplay and certainly should be left as-is. The problem is that because of this feature, you really don't have control over where on your opponent's body your bullets land during longer-range gunfights. And because the headshot multiplier is pretty huge, it's possible to win (or lose) all sorts of engagements due to RNG. 

My idea is that the headshot multiplier for *unscoped* weapons should decrease the farther away your enemy is. Hopefully that would reward gun skill at close to mid range while decreasing the RNG of longer-range gunfights. If that would make certain guns too weak, maybe their base damage could be increased to compensate. 

What do you think? Is everything fine as-is? Is there a more nuanced approach that I didn't think of because I haven't had my coffee yet?",FortNiteBR

I was in the ceiling/attic of a house, and I had knocked out the roof and fortified my surroundings with brick. Two guys were left in the map, and the guy who eventually killed us both and won, had a grenade launcher. His base was maybe 1 square wide but two or three squares tall. All Brick

Him and I started going at it while the guy who got second camped behind a tree. So I start shooting at the walls in the first place guys brick base. He easily repairs or replaces them. I had a blue AR and a purple scope AR, along with a shotty. I had Zero Splode.

Did I also mention that the circle decided to move to where his base was? So before that happens he starts launching nades at my fortified house. Im forced to move anyway because of the circle.

Now he has the high ground, and any cover I build on the ground is easily destroyed. I thought to advance and ramp up to shoot at him...but the nades kept coming. I eventually tried to build quick cover and take out the tree camper, as he seemed like an easy target to maybe get some splode from. But the first place guy killed me, and then the tree camper with splode.

Did I have any way of winning this fight? Seems like the end-game many times comes down to who has the most Splode. Luckily its not as frequent with the new patch, and Im glad the devs minimized the amount/availability of explosives.",FortNiteBR

 the fire rate especially. all the other close range weapons stand no chance against it, it's 100% accurate while jumping. if you meet someone with it in a close range situation all you can do is jump around like a fool and pray the enemy is bad.

in my opinion either nerf the firerate or don't allow headshots with it. It's kinda ridiculous that it can do 150 dmg in 1 shot. 

it takes away my freedom since you MUST use it in every close range situation. i generally don't enjoy using shotguns, i prefer headshots with pistol for example, but i need 3 of it to take 150 hp, while shotgun can do it in 1 shot.

this is just my opinion (after 900 solo games / 50 wins), how about yours?

I posted this on the PS4 subreddit, but thought some people here might enjoy this aswell!

Me and my friend just found out a way to play Fortnite Batle Royale together.
It's actually pretty easy. You just have to add each other on your epic games friendlist and then the PC player can join your party.

Steps:

*1. Link your PS4 Account with an [Epic Games Account.](https://www.epicgames.com/account/connected)

*2. Add each other on the Epic Games friendlist. It is not possible through the game on PS4, so I just gave my friend my account data and he added him on my account through the epic games launcher. You could download the launcher yourself or maybe (not 100% sure) add him in paragon. That might work aswell.

*3. Start Fortnite. Your friends should then see you on his friendlist and should be able to join you through the ingame menu. 

The ingame part works just fine. No lags or anything. You should maybe get into teamspeak, discord or whatever you like to communicate. The PC player won't show up on the ingame friednslist of the PS4, so PC can only join PS4, not vice versa. ",FortNiteBR

Q. When do you win in FortniteBR

A. Being the last man standing alive.

So the goal of this game is being the last one standing alive and so the leaderboards is (should) be aiming for rewarding to wins.

Playing for kills is not a problem, but is not the goal of the game.

**As an example, Football:** In the UEFA league (football worls in general actually), you dont see the system rewarding teams for having the highest ball possession, or most amount of attempts at shooting at the goal, no. It is simple: win or lose?

**Another example, League of Legends:** you get LP (points that makes you climb the ladder/leaderboards) for winning in a game a.k.a. destroying the enemy's Nexus. Not for most kills/total damage dealt/most dragons/barons, no. At the end it is all about wether the enemy's nexus is destroyed or not.

This may look like a ""no shit sherlock""- post for alot of people, but I also saw alot of people in this subreddit that didn't seem to understand this topic, hence why I made this post.

Hope this clears the confusion. Cheers.",FortNiteBR

I think that in the current state the pickaxe is kind of underpowered and could use a damage buff to, let's say, 20, or even 25.

However, in solo playlists, players had an exceptional amount of Medium ammo, allowing them to tear through structures and apply a seemingly endless amount of pressure with their assault rifles.

We will continue to evaluate the ammo availability within Battle Royale!

This is part 2 of what I think are valuable tips. Just like my first post, these tips will mostly be aimed at beginners.

In case you have missed the first post you can find it here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/76blpt/tip_collection_to_get_you_victory_royale/
Or watch it, if you prefer that: https://youtu.be/af6OYFTajo8

And of course, if you prefer to watch part 2 instead of reading it, here's the link: https://youtu.be/n3xaHEuv8Ao

**1. Land on rooftops.**

A lot of loot chests are hidden in attics so landing on the rooftop will be the quickest way to access them. While obvious, don’t forget you can easily steer your character while floating with your glider so you can land exactly where you want.

**2. Reload.**

Small tip, but forgetting this can have huge consequences. I don’t know about you guys but for some reason I do forget to reload often. Make sure your magazines are full and it will save you frustration.

**3.	Don’t rush for loot.**

When you killed someone, be careful when you rush for their loot. Those purple and orange drops will look very tempting but somebody might have seen what’s going on and will get an easy kill if you carelessly sprint towards the drops. Hold out a few seconds, check your surroundings and approach with caution. You could also throw down a few walls for protection; however, building might give away your position.

**4.	Use the camera wisely.**

You don’t need to stick your head out to look over an edge. You don’t need to peek around the corner to see around the corner. Position yourself in a clever way and by positioning the camera perfect you’ll get a good view of what you otherwise wouldn’t see.

**5.	Shoot in bursts.**

Don’t just keep hold of the trigger with a Submachine Gun or Assault Rifle. Shoot in short, controlled bursts. You’ll have a lot better accuracy and you’ll waste a lot less ammo.

**6.	Bushes are your friend.**

These things are brilliant. You love them and you hate them, but they make absolutely brilliant cover. When sitting in a bush, make sure you SLOWLY turn your character, otherwise your head will pop out leaving you exposed.
There have been loads of times where I sit in a bush closely inwards of the circle. The storm approaches and I see people sprinting past allowing me to down them easily.

**7.	How to dive down quick (PS4).**

Push the left stick forward and pull the right stick backwards. Nice and simple.

**8.	Sort out your inventory.**

When picking up loot, your items will automatically get a position in your inventory. I would advise to always put weapons in the same place. You do this by opening the inventory with touchpad, press X on the item you want to unequip, then X again to equip and the game will let you chose an inventory slot. This will not drop your weapons or items on the ground.
What you put where will depend on your play style.

**9.	Pick further landing spots.**

I know I’ve already mentioned landing spots in the previous tips post, but I would like to add that when you choose to land on areas that are further away from the bus, you are more likely to have that area for yourself. A lot of people jump out if the bus passes the area where they want to go and dive straight down.

Around the busy area’s there are also small single houses, these are brilliant as well to land on. Loot them quick and then move up to the crowded area nearby. Most likely there will already have been some fire fights and you’ll be able to jump somebody off guard or loot what’s left.

1st game: Hid the whole game, not running into a soul. Managed to stay on mountaintops and hide behind shit on the edge of circles till final 4.

That game taught me that sometimes the last kill is the only kill that matters! 

2nd game: Holy shit, this was intense. Literally got into a fight in every circle, it’s like I was fighting mini bosses. At one point I got knocked to 1 HP, hid behind a tree, and won with a lucky shotgun shot. Two circles later and I ended up 1 v 1 on either side of a big tree. Tree explodes, leaving both of us exposed, I fire a shot and boom, after surviving like 5 fights with my heart pounding like crazy I finally did it again!

I purchased it as a ""finished"" product only to find out that it was plagued with connection issues and exploitable/unplayable glitches and bugs. Almost 2 years and multiple broken promises later, the game is in worse shape then ever and the ""Ranked"" play is still in beta. Worst of all is UBI soft refuses to ban or punish players who exploit glitches. They seem to have no interest in maintaining the integrity of their game.

I feel like this experience is all too common in the industry today. Developers rush to get their game out before proper QC and testing are done and players are often $60 poorer and waiting for patches to fix the game they already paid for. Even more insulting is many times developers prioritize new digital content for micro transactions over improving the quality of the player experience.

Along comes Fortnite BR, free to play and smoothly connects 100 players simultaneously. They have a refreshing zero tolerance for cheaters and the development team seems hellbent on perfecting the player experience with an aggressive roadmap and they're incredibly receptive to their player base's concerns and feedback.

I haven't been this impressed or had this much fun with a game... maybe ever.

Also this will balance out the fights between someone who has a shield, and someone who doesn't have one

This will probably require the cast time on medkits too be lowered or they will be left useless, maybe have them apply a 25 shield aswell as give you 100 health ?

And it's hard to mitigate without caps. And I think it's time that caps are added to the game. PUBG (I know, I know...) does this by having a finite weight you can carry limiting the player from having infinite ammo. I think Epic can do this much easier by just putting a Hard Cap on inventory. 

Here's what is happening and why Caps would be good:

* Yey 25% rocket nerf, but that doesn't stop GuyX looting a bunch of ammo boxes, but never getting a rocket launcher or grenade launcher, so GuyY who has the same issue kills GuyX, now GuyY has double Rockets, but not gun! So the game progresses and GuyZ kills GuyY and now GuyZ has GuyX's and GuyYs rockets, BUT STILL NO GUN TO USE THEM! Then comes GuySpamsAlot, who has a rocket launcher and kills GuyZ and holy hell he just became the Spam legend. The 25% nerf isn't stopping this issue because Snowballing does not care about percentages. This same issue is happening with medium bullets as well, except now people are getting over 1000 bullets by their 3rd or 4th kill. So whats the fix?

* It's stupid simple: Cap rocket inventory slot to 12. It sounds extreme, but the FUN part of this game is building, and having no way to make a cool base, or fun ending confrontation because GuySpamsAlot is king of the final 5 is boring. Many people have issues with this. If GuySpamsAlot can't have more than 12 rockets then he has to choose WISELY when and where to use them. I am making it 12, because that is TWO clips of a Grenade Launcher. 

* Cap Medium Bullets to 500. There is no reason you should need more than 500 bullets at any given time. It's a far cry better than most people who have 250 as a high number before the patch. Keep the stack grab the same at 20 bullets a stack, but cap it at 500. It'll reign in the spamming that is happening now.

* Cap Sniper Bullets to 50. Having 100 endless Sniper Shots also feels a bit strong, though not as strong as the other issues because Sniper requires more skill. But 50 here feels like plenty no one need 200 sniper shots. Which promotes a very campy playstyle late game.

* Cap Shotgun shots to 50 as well. Also no reason to need more than 50. 

* Remove all small ammo guns from the game, kappa. (Seriously these guns need major tweaks altogether)",FortNiteBR

This also makes these 2 weapons more viable , since you already know the tactical shotgun is one of the most common and best short range weapons.

Which is really odd that not even 16:9 works properly with this game. I mean 16:9 monitors have been around forever at this point.

What the game is doing is Locking the horizontal FoV reguardless of Aspect Ratio, and scaling the vertical FoV. 

However there was a pretty simple fix you could do to make the game work with 21:9 and 16:9 monitors properly.

You could simply add 

[/Script/Engine.LocalPlayer]
AspectRatioAxisConstraint=AspectRatio_MaintainYFOV

And you fixed the game for all monitors and aspect ratios.

That fix no longer works.


The number 1 reason I chose to play FBR over pubg is that I could actually play in 21:9 without restrictions. But it's not just 21:9 that's affected, it's 16:9 as well. The game is basically operating like a game from early 2000s

Now that I can't do that It's rather spoiled the game for me.

The game is so far zoomed in now that I cannot actually play the game. The top and bottom of the screen are cut off so much that it causes me a bit of motion sickness and discomfort.

If there is a skill cap, Ninja is a player near the top of it. Skill caps with gulfs as large as the one between players like him and the rest of us show that yes, while there is RNG, the best players understand there are mechanics and tactics available to them in the game that can help turn the luck more in their favor regardless of the outcome of their bullet spread. 

Hearthstone had a similar issue for awhile where everyone who didn't understand how to play around the counters to their own decks would only blame RNG for their low ladder placements. I think in the case of Fornite while yes, the bloom could definitely use some more tuning past the point it's at right now, obviously in the case of people like Ninja (who has regularly been racking up 15+ kill wins on stream) there's a system to it and if you can learn that you can dominate.

Get that muscle memory for constructing down! 

- **Positional awareness.** Generally, the closer you are to the center of the island and storm's eye, the riskier your position will be. Try to avoid low ground and open areas if possible. Think about where most players landed and where they're headed. Think about the best positions in the white circles (high ground, lots of coverage of land). Jump frequently while running to look at your surroundings for opponents. Often safe players will hug the boundaries to lessen the chance of getting caught in bad positions.

- **Loot effectively and quickly.** Many players spend way too long scavenging. An average house should take 15-30 sec. Always keep your weapon slots in mind so you can switch out weapons you dont want as you're running by. 
 
- **Use headphones!** Locating the direction of a distant shot at you, footsteps of an opponent wrapping around your fort, hearing someone switch weapons inside a house that you're approaching. These things seem small but they can make the difference between life and death.

- **Know when to (not) engage**. Unless you're extremely confident in your skills or feel lucky, remember every time you're shooting, you're an audible beacon for nearby opponents. If you're attempting to kill an opponent across Loot Lake, you need to realize there might be opponents near you who might've otherwise completely ignored you who now know your location.

Anecdote of a noob.,"Been playing PvP shooters since Goldeneye and Quake. Many hours in all the big ones since then, from Halo on up. Most recently played Destiny 2 (we won't get into that). And then Fortnite BR comes along.

I get nervous in big team battles. Never played stuff like this, a new realm and I am scared shitless. Jump in Duo's with a friend who swears by this game.

I go through a trial by fire, so much dying, so many fuck-ups. But... I am LOVING it. Whether I die one minute in or make it to the top 10... I have FUN. Yes - that word right there.... FUN. I am having **FUN**.

Am I chasing loot? Leaderboards? Special gear? Artificial levels? Grinding for that next thingy you get for something trivial? NO. 

Every time I play, I am jumping from a fucking bus with a pickaxe, and there is NO TELLING what awaits me on the ground, but I can affect that outcome to an extent. If things go awry, no worries - I'm back in there within moments trying again.

Yes - I am a noob. Not even a dozen full games under my belt. But the other night, I got down to the final 6 with my veteran buddy and I pulled off some shit I could not even believe I was capable of. Placed 4th in that match in the end, but holy hell did I have a FUCKING BLAST. I received no special reward. No loot, nothing to make me jump right back in and grind for what I might have missed or pursue what others possessed.

I jumped back in because I felt a thrill and sense of accomplishment - even mediocre as it was - that manifested two very addicting feelings: (1) Exhilarating combat in clutch moments that truly anchored to my prowess (and faults therein)... and (2) An incessant internal urge to apply what I learned from that encounter and do better next time.

Sorry for the long-winded rant, and maybe as noob I'm already saying stuff that's already been said. But I have to say, this game is a breath of fresh air in the deluge of ""Triple-A"" shooters that seek to drain our wallets whilst delivering only the illusion of ""fun"" upon a vehicle of shallow ""reward systems"".

I have found TRUE fun and TRUE reward in Fortnite BR and it's so, so desperately needed in this gaming climate.

Oh - AND ITS FREE!!! LOL What a no brainer.

-Add a skill based movement: This could be grapple hooks, Bhopping, Jetpacks, Jump packs,Character skills like charges or rolls. This gives you something to do when you gotta run like 600m at a pace of 2m a second. For such a ""Fast paced game"" your character sure is fucking slow.

-Also stop paying youtubers to play the game its disgusting and anyone with half a brain (or anyone that can understand rick and morty humor) knows when videos are sponsored.

I am a console player on the Xbox one, this game is incredible but I've noticed a few issues that almost ruin the game for me and I have a few questions regarding these small problems.

Inventory sorting, switching weapons, building and looting all tends to have some sort of delay. I'm in Hawaii, but I don't think it's a ping issue, something about the game just feels off. I watch gameplay on PC and everything is so fluid and smooth and it's just not like that on console. Is there a way developers can improve this currently, or is this not going to be possible until the new Xbox One X arrives? Not to hate on the game, these are just questions and things I have noticed. 

Framerate lag, not a huge problem, but the game will definitely be more enjoyable when it runs smoother. I'm no game developer but Battlefield One runs very smoothly and it's on a big map with a lot of people and a lot of stuff happening at the same time. Does Fortnite BR have more stuff going on or is it just kinda clunky and laggy by design? I have no idea, again just looking for answers if the game will ever run smoother on console.

And lastly, the lack of weapons. Some might disagree but I'm hoping for some more unique weapons and maybe unique properties of weapons when they are of legendary quality. In addition to this I'd like to see every weapon have every tier. Like a legendary pistol or revolver. Or a Purple Burst Rifle, etc.

the current aiming system, and I'd like to touch upon what I think are some common concerns, and two general changes that I think would be likely to keep most people happy.


Here's what the general concerns are from both sides of the issue: 

From what I've seen, the general consensus from those against the current aiming system is that some fights are unfair, and that guns should have less bloom or be more accurate in other ways. Typically, the argument is that people who are more skilled should be winning more gunfights.

On the flip side, those who don't want the system to change believe that more reliable/consistent aiming will make the game less fun, because there could be a lot of camping or getting killed by a non-sniper from miles away. Typically, the argument is that people should mitigate the effects of inconsistent aim via positioning, building, picking the right ranges/fights, and generally improved strategy.


Here's my view of the situation, which will lead into what I think can/should be changed:

1. Yes, it's very true that building and positioning are very important in this game (and many people do not take full advantage of these). However, even when people use positioning to their advantage and the proper gun for specific ranges, fights can be lost due to RNG. Even if you are crouched/still, and aiming at the target's center, shots can miss. Sometimes, the person being shot at starts running and jumping around shooting at you and lands a few lucky hits, downing/killing you. I know that this doesn't happen to people extremely often, but it is still a frustrating experience for many people. When some shots miss, it doesn't feel fair. Dying because of it is not very fun.

2. Some people are concerned that removing bloom or making xyz change will lead to camping or getting killed from ridiculous ranges with rifles. I will agree that it would not be much fun at all for these things to happen. HOWEVER, I think that this issue can be resolved by looking at other other aspects of the guns in this game, such as the amount of damage that some guns do at a long range. Yes, people shouldn't be able to down/kill you from a mile away with a couple shots from an AR. That's not fun. It's debatable, but I think it's fair for someone be able to hit you if they have the aim (not luck) to do so.


What I think the general solution should be, and why:

1. Every gun (besides snipers) should have damage drop-off to match with their intended ranges. 
Regardless of whether or not changes are made to accuracy, it feels very frustrating and un-fun to get pegged by an AR from way outside of it's intended range and lose a third or more of your health. If it was just a lucky shot on top of that, it feels even worse. Reducing damage outside of a gun's intended range would mean that aspects of strategy such as positioning would matter much more in whether or not a fight is successful. Players would also not be as discouraged from moving to get a better position, since the likelihood of getting 2-3 shot by a rifle while moving up is much smaller.

2. (Debatable, but important in my opinion) Gun accuracy and consistency should be increased. If using a gun at optimal range, any shot that is properly aimed/paced should hit right on or at least very close to the target. If bloom is reduced or removed, then something else like more recoil needs to be added to compensate so that spraying is unlikely to be effective. If bloom isn't changed, then the first shot or two should at least have minimal spread.

With these changes, I believe that the game will be much closer to becoming both fair and fun, with much less frustration from either side of the issue. Less damage from non-snipers at extreme ranges would encourage better positioning and lower the stress/risk of playing more actively, which would lead to less camping, more action in matches, and diversity in play styles. All of these results typically mean that matches are more fun and less stressful. More consistency means that those who lose gunfights will know that they lost fairly, and that the other person was not just lucky, but instead had the better positioning, timing, aim, or general strategy.",FortNiteBR

I have for you two bus dropping strategies that I have found great success using I’m currently 2/5/6 for wins so I know what I’m talking about at least remotly.

Drop start number one: This is pretty basic, odds are if you drop on a highly populated area you’re going to die. Let’s assume everyone has equal gun skill in tomato town and six people drop in it. You now have a 1 in 6 chance of being the winner and grabbing the massive amount of loot named zones have. The problem is even if you win, you can only carry so much gear... so what I purpose is you drop of none named places on the map, this isn’t a new strategy by far the part that I believe helps me win games is I try to drop as close to the coast as possible. After grabbing my loot I follow the coast to the zone this GUARANTEES that nobody can flank me from this side which makes you 25% safer.

Next strategy sounds a little weird and if your a loot whore you probably won’t like the sound of it: Wait until the last 2 seconds before the bus leaves to drop. After your out of the bus instantly deploy your umbrella/glider and GLIDE toward dead center of the map (this is helpful to save time) once there wait until the smoke tells you where the initial ring will spawn. Now drop on a place around the center of the eye of the storm. Chose a place that looks unlooted to drop, if you see a broken roof chances are it’s looted. Now that you have a usually weak weapon you can use your superior circle position to ambush someone as they come in for their gear if you did not get enough. (This strategy works best in solo and duos)

Hope these help see you on the field.",FortNiteBR

Late game players (Players who survive to 20th place or better) should have to make a decision about crossing that river in half their games.  I say half because, depending on where you land, the final few circles may already be on your side of the map.

Right now, the bridges and the river dont play in our decisions throughout most of our games.  Campers dont watch the river because people can sprint accross it and if you get a kill, it's a ways to grab the loot.  If players are forced to slow down when crossing the river, more exciting scenarios will pop up for us.

Epic, make the river deeper so that anyone walking across has to wade through it like they do in Loot Lake.  Do it for us!  Do it for the game!  Do it for yourselves for goodness sakes.

Yes, I know that console players can use a keyboard/mouse too but I bet very few of them do this. There would only be a handful per game.

If it's a simple toggle option I'd love to see it added. When the game starts to get more popular and more competitive, I think having a feature like this is very important.

See Rocket League for example. They added the feature to disable cross play between PC and consoles for this very reason. It wasn't an issue at first, until it became more popular and more competitive. Console players don't like to feel disadvantaged.

It is just plain out faster paced all around. You get into game lobbies quicker, you get on the bus faster, the action is faster paced and comes much more often than in PUBG, and winning a match is typically a faster affair.      

When Epic made the update to allow a lobby to cut the wait time to 15 seconds once the room is full and everyone loads in, it was goodbye PUBG, Hello FNBR. I still absolutely love PUBG, and feel that it is the ultimate Battle Royale experience, but Fortnite just wins me over with how quickly I can get in and play mulitple games in a session.

Most games enforce a weapon's effective range by having damage drop off; after a certain distance your gun is basically a pea shooter, forcing you to take engages within a certain range. Fortnite doesn't have this, damage values are constant at all ranges. Instead, we have built-in inaccuracy which causes your shots to have a miss chance that increases with range. This makes it so that you can't just two shot someone with a grey rifle at 300m with good aim. 

Here's some math to prove my point (x is distance to target):  
DPS with dropoff = damage(x)\*firerate, where damage is a function that decreases as x increases.  
DPS with spread = damage\*firerate\*hitchance(x), where hit chance decreases as x increases.  

So what's the difference? One model has RNG and the other doesn't. That's it. Spread affects everyone the same way. Does RNG reduce your skill edge against bad players? Yes, but in a game with no skill rating this is necessary otherwise the best players are just gonna win a ridiculous amount of the time and it's going to be really not fun for newer/worse players.

With that being said. How do explain PUBG being so successful? The gun mechanics work on a controllable recoil and allow a more skilled player to win a fight. Yes there are so many other factors but the gunplay at least isn't random. The first shot is accurate and the rest are controllable.

Then you have this game. I've seen games with bloom before but never like this.

I always like to use Poker as an example. You can find debate at every casino and home game poker table how much skill versus luck determines who wins. 

In a single hand of poker, any player with any two cards can win the hand. 7-2o can beat AA. When the person with AA gets beat they often get very mad that the guy with the worse starting hand didn't fold earlier in the hand. The truth is, a good poker player **wants** all of their opponents to play 7-2o every time he has AA.. because even though he may lose a hand every now and then, over 100 hands the AA will win far more than worse starting hands. If you get mad because you got beat by a worse hand, you don't understand how to be profitable playing poker.

In a single 10 man poker tournament, ANYONE at the table can win. Including a person that has never played poker and needs a little cheat sheet to remind them what hands beat other hands. However, if those 10 people played 1000 times, I can safely bet my entire bank account that the most skilled player will have the best overall results. 

-----

**If you aim more accurately than your opponent, you may get killed *this time*... however if you engage with 100 opponents that have less gun skill than you, you'll win the battle the majority of the time.**

The most important thing to understand is that this ""luck"" or ""RNG"" is why many people play the game. If the most skilled player won every battle and every game, this game, and every other game would vanish due to lack of popularity.

-----

Every game where you die, you have a few choices on how you process the loss:

1) I didn't use optimal strategy and could have made better choices to give me a higher chance of success.

2) I did everything right but just got unlucky this time. Over the long term my strategy is effective.

3) The game or other players are unfair and it's their fault I died.

The people that choose option #1 the most often improve the most at Fortnite, other games, and real life. Option 2 isn't bad if it's accurate.. but in almost every case, there is something you could have learned. People that choose option 3 will struggle to improve. Once you understand this concept, you'll quickly be able to identify #1 people versus #3 people in games and in your life.

I'm talking about shooting the RPG's with bullets to detonate them before they hit you. This idea came to me yesterday when I was in duos with my buddy. 8 people left and of course 1 team had an RPG and proceeded to fire shot after shot at our fort while we frantically tried to build wall after wall to stay alive. Eventually an idea came to me, and my reddit mythbuster skills swung into action. I started to try and shoot the rockets as they approached us. After about the 3rd rocket I knew that it simply wasn't possible but got me thinking about if this was made possible. 

1. HUGE balance to RPG's. The latest patch decreased rocket ammo spawn rate so maybe that'll help, but usually the guy with an RPG has a massive advantage. Especially with its range and accuracy, you can snipe across map. If we could shoot the rockets to blow them up before they could hit us or our fort it would be a massive balance against their destructive power.

2. Focuses the RPG's value. It'd no longer be a long range pinpoint accurate destroyer. It would be used to more close range situations and would be much less spammable. This would also make the grenade launcher more viable and even favored in some situations.

3. Crazy shit could happen. Imagine sniping a kids RPG as soon as it left the launcher and nukes his own fort and team. I would absolutely love that.

This is just a suggestion that I thought would be cool. Using skillshots to try and counteract the power of RPG's seems cool to me because of the clips and crazy shit that could happen. If this was made possible they could always increase the rocket speed to make them harder to hit and still viable. Thoughts?",FortNiteBR

297,Fortune22,1508230687,76xb73,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/76xb73/calculate_your_average_placement_stat/,17,Calculate Your Average Placement Stat,"Piggybacking off /u/wes3449's formula, here's a way to calculate a good, rough estimate for your average placements in Fortnite solos, duos, and squads:

&amp;nbsp;

 Solos = ((wins x 1) + (top10s x 5) + (top25s x 12.5) + (all_other_games x 62.5)) / total_games_played

&amp;nbsp;

 Duos = ((wins x 1) + (top5s x 2.5) + (top12s x 6) + (all_other_games x 31)) / total_games_played

&amp;nbsp;

 Squads = ((wins x 1) + (top3s x 1.5) + (top6s x 3) + (all_other_games x 15.5)) / total_games_played

&amp;nbsp;

Assumptions:

 *The formula assumes that you get a perfectly average placement within a placement stat. For example, for all of your top 10 finishes, it assumes you get an equal amounts of 2nd and 10th place finishes. Obviously this isn't true for all people, as some extreme cases will score all 2nds or all 10ths, but it is a good estimate for it's intended purpose.

&amp;nbsp;

 *The formula assumes that all placements for a certain queue are uniform and equal. For example, the formula assumes that for squads there are 25 teams of 4 players equaling 100 total players. We know that for squads, and even to an extent for duos, this isn't always the case as people queue up with only 3, 2, or even 1 no fill players that encompas a squad. The result of this is that the numbers can be skewed a bit but not enough to be of much significance IMO.

&amp;nbsp;

Other:

 Here's /u/wes3449's original formula: 

  Average finish ~= (wins1 + top10s5 + top25s12.5 + everything_else62.5)/games_played

&amp;nbsp;

  * I tried to clarify the formula a bit, hopefully that helped, but changed none of it's logic.

  * The logic behind the multiplier for all_other_games is derived by taking the variable for the highest placement scored for that queue (for duos this would be: top12s = 12), then subtracting that from total placements (for duos this would be 50), then halving that number to give us a middle average for non placement games, and finally subtracting all of that from total games in order to give us the all_other_games multiplier. 

&amp;nbsp;

   Here it is in a formula:

   all_other_games multiplier = total_places - ((total_places - highest_placement_scored) / 2)

&amp;nbsp;

   Example for duos: 

   all_other_games multiplier = 50 - ((50 - 12) / 2) = 31

&amp;nbsp;


Thanks /u/LaziestRedditorEver 

Edit: all_other_games is derived from adding up all the matches where you placed, and subtracting them from your total games played. This means that all_other_games is not a fixed value but is instead individual to the player based on how many games they have played.


So say for example that you placed top1 2 times, top10 8 times, top25 20 times and your total number of games played is 100. Then, you would add up all of the matches in which you placed, for this example that would be 30, and then subtract that from the total games which would be 100. That would gives us 70 matches for all_other_games.

The all_other_games *multiplier* is a fixed constant and is already given in the formulas (this is 62.5 for solos). This is distinct from the variable ""all_other_games"" which will be different for every player depending on how many games they have played. I tried to explain above how to get your individual ""all_other_games"" number.",FortNiteBR

Rainbow Six on the original XBox had RNG but it wasn't an issue because their reticule was always a circle.  The circle grew in size when your RNG got worse.

So if you were strafing left and right with a shotgun, your circle was massive.

Standing still with an Uzi, the circle was smaller.

Kneeling with a burst assault rifle and keeping still, your circle was pretty tiny.

Your shots always landed somewhere in the circle.

Right now Fortnite is struggling because out reticule is usually a dot and when the dot in on an enemy, we think we should be hitting that enemy.

You get in a gunfight with an enemy and you both have the same gun. First shot right on him, you shoot. MISS! Damn. You shoot again at his head. MISS! Now you begin to panic and get annoyed and mess up a shot missing, but what's this? HIT! What am I trying to say? I think epic are forgetting what makes a competitive shooter competitive. SKILL, not RNG. (Argue with me about it not being a competitive shooter if you want, but in a game where you are fighting to be the last one standing.. That's being competitive.) I love this game more than PUBG, so do my friends. But in the end we find our self going back to PUBG because of the skill difference. In a competitive shooter there should not be heavy RNG in a gun fight. Even Siege is removing it's old recoil and adding in patterns. 

TLDR: It's not fun to lose a gunfight just because RNG favored that other guys bullet more. And I feel like that will be the downfall of this game, and PUBG will find it's way staying above BR because of that. I'm sure a lot will disagree, tell me to get good etc. But my point still stands that RNG in a gunfight isn't fun. 

Fix Idea: Give automatics more recoil, not a lot of RNG spread. Make first shot land exactly where you are aiming. The next shots after where you are aiming wont be accurate, it will land somewhere around where you are aiming instead of in the next dimension.  

Fix Idea 2: Separate game-mode that is more skill based with recoil over RNG spread. Kind of like how PUBG has 1st person &amp; 3rd person. ",FortNiteBR

I haven't seen anyone articulate the exact issue, but I think I've figured it out. 

Shields leave no collectable advantage after use.

Let me explain further. Every collectable item in the game can be salvaged after a kill, and this behavior incentivizes engaging opponents with stronger items since their death means YOUR arsenal is bolstered by their remains.

Shields are the only exception. In PUBG, killing a player with high level armor usually means a hefty protection upgrade and/or replacement, whereas in Fortnite late game, it's much better to avoid all players if you don't have shield, no matter how strong your weapons are. 

The end circles have zero percent chance of upgrading your own resistance, and that's kind of a shame....That paired with no healing past 75 without a Medkit, and you're looking at a late game balance issue.

I'm sure there are a lot of ways to fix this, but acknowledging the core issue is the first step.

*EDIT:* It's pretty silly to assume that winning and exploring balance issues are mutually exclusive. Shields are a contentious item and are definitely worth discussing, even if they aren't game-breaking. Try to have an open mind. :D",FortNiteBR

(Console),"What’s up guys, Kohzi here, thought I’d give some tips on gameplay. I currently have over a dozen wins and just wanted to share some insight on this lovely game. These are things that work for me and I usually finish top 10 every game.  Like I said, works for me so i know not everyone will be successful. Anyway, I’ll just jump right into it! I play on XB1 btw.

Tip 1:  Don’t be afraid of combat

I see so many people (many my friends) that want to stay far away from battle and drop in on the outskirts. While this does sometimes have its advantages, what usually happens is you drop to get crappy loot and spend the next 10 minutes running away from the storm/to the eye. So frustrating and you’ll always end up being killed by someone with a 5 star scar with full shields or some OP shit. That leads me to my second tip.

Tip 2:  Pick a drop zone relatively close, then look to slay

I love to go to Retail Row because there is usually a gun of some sort on top of the 2 large retail stores and its clutch to be packing heat before you have open up your first door. Once you found a weapon, there will be at least half a dozen people running around looking for loot, go after them as soon as you see them without a weapon.  People tend to avoid houses they see others going to because they’re afraid of death. Find those people quickly and kill them, loot them, and then loot their house. Then go to the next house. By the time you’re there, roughly 70 people will be left and you’re sitting on hella loot. A Tactical shotgun is a must here.

This will also improve your 1v1 skills. It’s alright if you start 5 games in a row and die instantly...YOU WILL GET BETTER!!

Tip 3: Wood is great, but stone is much better

I can’t tell you how many people I see that ignore mining stone and just go for trees because it’s quicker. There is stone everywhere and it’s so much stronger, it will decide the winner when you get down to 12 people. I feel naked if I have less than 300. Build up to the mountains with wood and then create your air walk/base with stone. It’s funny to watch people waste precious ammo trying to break it down as you keep building towards them whilst 100 ft above the. Yes steel is stronger but it takes longer to mine and is not as accessible across the map. Always make your walls with stone especially if you’re getting shot at from behind. Build up, get the higher vantage point and do some damage.

Tip 4: Play on Quick Builder

Just do it, you’ll thank me later.

Tip 5: Get to the center of the circle as fast as possible.

The last thing you should be worried about is the fuckin storm coming after you. Get to that circle, people literally have to come to you. Like I said before, stick to the high ground as much as possible. I can’t stress this enough.

If you try to incorporate some of that into your gameplay, I think you’ll have a much better time and overall improve. Sorry if it was long and wordy but I’m extremely bored and thought I would offer my advice to some people struggling out there. If I misspelled anything, I’m sorry again, put this together pretty quick.

If you want more help, feel free to add/message me on my XBL GT: Kohzi.  I’m always looking to play with new gamers! I’ll be online and streaming for the next 4 hours, don’t be shy!  Hope this helped and I look forward to hearing back from some of you! Happy Hunting!",FortNiteBR

**Close Range**: Prioritize a tactical shotgun. When you're in a gunfight, do not crouch. It makes it much easier for a player to get a headshot on you, especially when they also have a shotgun. Jump up and down and spam shots. The tactical shotgun is proof that weapon bloom is a trash mechanic. Best way to rack up kills.

**Mid-range**: Prioritize on the highest rarity AR, but don't expect to accurately land your shots. In fact, you'll be more likely to headshot a player by shooting them at their stomach than their head. Therefore aim at the center of a player. Another tip, never use a sniper rifle in a mid-range gunfight. The reason being, the sniper rifle has an extremely slow projectile which can easily be missed and dodged, meanwhile all other guns use hitscan, which basically means, the moment you click at a player with a cursor, they'll get hit.

**Range**: Use sniper rifles obviously. Chances are, you'll need to hit ahead of the player because the projectile speed is probably the speed of an arrow in a medieval game. Remember that because of hitscan, an assault rifle cannot shoot you from a very far distance. If you're too far, the shot wont work for them, they'll just waste bullets. Therefore use that to your advantage.

For the rest of the slots get explosive weapon and healing items, very simple concept. Also don't forget traps. You now know how to reach top and even win battle royale matches.

Except they have rockets grenades and odds are you wont be in the next circle. So in conclusion the best strategy for winning is letting all the noobs kill eachother while you either sit in a small box or in a bush. I've won 50+ games and the odds are that getting in a fight is not worth it even if you win. I wish there were no shields and instead we had 200 hp and we could bandage up to 150 or something.

Lastly I have to vent my frustration, cause I accumulated shitton of it. if you are delicate and can't handle rants, please, just go read something else.

---

I really don't understand how people can shoot and actually hit me with just any weapon from sniper-range (slightly exagerating) while jumping and dashing? Screw just body-hitting THEY GODDAMN HEADSHOT me.

While I can't hit anyone with M16 even when crouching, being still, pacing my each shoot for max accuracy and focusing my goddamn soul into crosshair. I also change my spot from time to time, inbetween shots to not be a ""sitting duck"" (although, it doesn't matter, cause they still hit me).

What the hell is wrong? 95% of all of my shoots go RIGHT PAST THROUGH anyone i'm shooting. My ping is fine, I don't lag, enemies also ""feel fine"".

---

From that moment I learned M16 is garbage (in my hands). I once managed to get myself a purple ""scarr"" (or w/e it is called). I've seen how ""pros"" use it with their almost 99% accuracy. What happens when I try to do the same? (shooting in small bursts, waiting for accuracy to increase, crouching etc)

EVERY GODDAMN SHOT EITHER HITS AROUND MY TARGET OR GOES RIGHT PAST THROUGH THEM.

My crosshair is tighest it can get, I'm still as a goddamn stone, camping, I aim at the guys body, not even daring to try headshooting. Crosshairs are perfectly aimed at the dude. Distance is about 1,5 distance of granade throw. Burst for 2-4 bullets, always waiting to regain best focus. And what? Miss after Miss and then the dude runs like mad, jumps, runs and retliates and he hits me every second shot. I know I should have ran away, change position, but I kinda lost the will to even try after going full clip in bursts on scarr and not hitting the dude even once.

---

I also saw people using revolver with sniper-like accuracy, so I decided to try it out, couldn't land even 1 goddamn shot. No matter the distance. The bullet spread was insane, like the crosshairs were in fact 5 times bigger than they show. It felt Like i'd start shooting behind me that's how inaccurate it was.

---

I learned a ""trick"" with using shotgun while landing. Cool (although I can't headshot at all because I suck). Sadly everyone and their mothers kill me from a distance aimbot would have issues to hit with weapons that were clearly not designed to be as precise even at half the distance they shoot.

Just today I died several times to a M16 dudes that were either sniping people from across the map or were jumpping like ADHD on coffeine while having spot-on accuracy

I know I keep on repeating myself, but that's how every of my game went. It was the same miserable repeats of PROs slaughering my ass over and over and over. If I ever learned anything from todays playing that is: To just not play this game... Shame I wanna play.. I wanna get better at it.. Gimme some (real) advices, preferably helpful ones :/

---

TL;DR

* I suck (that's a fact)

* either everyone has some obvious way to ignore accuracy drop or this game is full of cheaters

* Someone.. Teach me.. How the hell do I actually shoot people and hit them? 

* Someone.. Explain me.. How the hell those people hit me while just shooting in my general direction while doing everything to have lowest accuracy possible?",FortNiteBR

All of our experiences, multiple wins in each game mode for each of us, have led us to the idea noted in the title: Shield pots are a terrible change from body armor/helmets in PUBG.


They have all of the same issues as body armor—the early-game advantage of finding one before the skirmish between teams/individuals in your area and the way that this snowballs in a loot-based game—but none of the balancing elements—the fact that BO doesn't protect you from head-shots, and, far more critically, if you outplay your advantaged opponent(s), you are unable to take their armor (even if damaged) for yourself and assume their advantage.


I can understand the following two reasons why the migration from BO/Helmets was done:

1.) Simplicity, a singular item with a stacking effect instead of multiple qualities of two separate items 

2.) Induction time, a good idea, a possible resolution is to vastly increase the induction (to perhaps 10s) so as to mitigate its advantage.


Both of these are fairly compelling, especially taken alongside the other forms of streamlining of the genre that FN has moved forward with to accommodate its unique additions (minecraft cosplay) but the fact that pots are, unique amongst items, not dropped on death is a huge injection of RNG into an RNG-filled genre (which is fine, this is what people are signing up for, the genre component, that is).

In these lag spikes, there is a lot of rubber banding, sound effects become dodgy, chests don't open, guns double-firing, what you'd normally expect from lag spikes, except in Battle Royale they last longer and are more frequent.

I feel like it makes the game much easier and therefore less skillful. I think this because people can abuse the Third-Person Perspective vision to see people that can't see them and are able to secure easy kills.

First Person Perspective would allow for more skill to be involved. You would be forced to actually peak angles, where you could either get a kill or be killed. The better shooter will come out on top (hopefully) as they have better aim and mechanics. Third Person Perspective takes away from this.

I would reccomend to add options for Fortnite Battle Royale to be able to play EITHER Third Person or First Person.  For Example: You can search to play with Third-Person or First-Person FortniteBR, and everyone in your server will be using the same perspectivie (e.g. Everyone is using First-Person in the server/game).

If this is already planned by the Developers, a heads-up (In this thread as a comment) would be greatly appreciated. I am loving your game, and your interaction on this Subreddit! Keep up the good work and I hope you can implement my suggestion!

Thank you for reading.

Edit: Elaborated on the suggestion.

Edit 2: Everyone please understand that my thread is a BALANCED argument which talks about both sides. I display the advantages and the disadvanages of both perspectives. I am simply providing a suggestion, and this suggestion WILL NOT affect you if implemented. If you want to stick to Third-Person, only que Third-Person - simple as that.

Edit 3: ""Fortnite: Battle Royale’ claims 10 million players Just two weeks after it launched."" - https://www.engadget.com/2017/10/11/fortnite-battle-royale-claims-10-million-players/

I doubt Players of FortniteBR would even feel or see a change in que times for there games. If any, it would be so insignificant it wouldn't matter. Battle Royale as a gamemode NEEDS First-Person Perperspective to be more skillfull and fair - as it is a competitive gamemode where you MUST survive amongst 99 other players. If the game is less fair and less skillfull with Third-Person - kills, information and wins are not AS deserved as they would be in a more fair and skillfull system which First-Person would provide.

Considering that the loot in the lake house isn´t really that better than the rest of the loot ingame, the payoff to drop at the house sets you in a real disetvantage because of a bad risk/reward balance.

we really like the lake house in duo, it´s ultra fun, but dropping there is just a death trap (at least if the guys at the port aim probably).

suggestions: 
-place higher quality loot at the lake house to make it more attractive
- don´t change the loot and place some rocks in the lake to give you a little bit of couver.
- conncet lake house with wooden brigdes to the factorys and to the appartement (to walk faster from a to b)
-put some little islands on the lake (to walk faster from a to b)

pls note: i don´t suggest ALL changes but one of them should be enough to make this great drop spot more viable =)

I remember playing Goldeneye, then Halo with gangster online play through my pc, halo 2 with legit multiplayer, was awesome, then COD, zombies... all awesome eras of my video career. But there is something special about this game.

While the gameplay is familiar and the rules similar to other games’ hardcore modes (low health, no regen, no respawns) the presentation is playful. The combination of the that playful with the hardcore is what makes this so cool. 

While at first I thought the presentation was gonna make the game feel cartoony, I think the playful graphics allow you to suspend disbelief on some of the more arcady aspects, such as the walls being liquified as they are slashed with a giant pick axe, and the ability to build structures mid battle.

Beyond some minor button remapping, and some bug fixes, I would not change much about this game.

... and it’s free!

TLDR : Kudos to the developers. ",FortNiteBR

Games have to be the slowest thing I've experienced. Console players have so little control when it comes to swapping weapons, quick building, etc.

Games are so campy it's unbelievable. And you thought Call of Duty was campy?

And sure, hate on me all you want. Call me bad. I had this game since Battle Royale came out. I have tons of wins and kills at the point of this post. 

I had a 13 kill duo lost by myself (teammate died) and I lost because the remaining happen to have a fort built in the beginning of the match. I know because before I was last vs them. I avoided them. I must have been their only kills for the win since I got killed by an M4 and their fort was wood.

I was the better player in the situation. But because I was too busy actually running around the map, and using the build system to maneuver, I lost because I didn't want to camp up.

Doesn't even have to look like a pickaxe tbh. You could have a woodcutters axe, a scythe, a medieval sword, lead piping, spanner etc etc. 

**Various types of gliders**

A balloon where you hold onto the string, a mini helicopter where you hold onto the bars, a proper hang glider etc etc. Camos available on all types of gliders? 

**Clothing**

Maybe sort them into top, bottom &amp; head gear. This could be anything! Headphones, baseballs caps, fancy sun glasses, Jason face gear, a top hat, who knows. Hoodies to body warmers or a tank top? 

**Characters customisation**

Unlock new hairstyles or faces? Idk. Less options here. Hopefully eventually we can change gender, skin, face, hair, hair colour, facial hair. I'm ok with having no unlockables here.

**Challenges**

Items can be unlocked through in game challenges such as:

5 sniper headshots in one game. 

Build upto the maximum height. 

Find a legendary RPG. 

Get a kill over 150M. 

Open 2 supply drops in one game. 

Then you have your overtime challenges:

Win 100 games. 

Get 500 shotgun kills. 

Open a total of 50 supply drops. 

Build 1000 metal walls. 

Blah blah blah. There's so many damn options! Some can be unlocked via challenges, some can be unlocked by an in game currency perhaps? You earn overtime by placing top 10 in a game? Some maybe you have to buy, support the amazing developers etc etc.

I also understand certain items might stand out more than others but there should be some silly things that people might want to where at their own risk. You can easily make different types of Camos too, tiger camo, digital camo, hexagon camo or whatever, just to please the try hard gamers. 

Hopefully epic games will consider all these types of cosmetics over time. The first to come should definitely be character customization and your basic selection of clothing. 

Nonetheless I'm very excited for the future of cosmetics and I can't wait to see what's to come! :)

I know the developers are working on adding more cosmetics to the game and I am very excited about it, but here is my take on it.

In my opinion it would be cool if you could get cosmetic items (this could be anything from clothing to sprays to skins, etc) by getting achievements using certain guns. This would help people get out of their comfort zone and use guns that they wouldn't normally use, and it would also add a little bit of challenge and make your games more varied. 

Using the same guns every single game can get stale, so if you are forced to get X amount of headshots with said gun for that hat that you really want, it would have you favoring a certain gun when normally you would never think of taking it over another. I'm not sure if there is any substance to this idea, so I wanted to get your guys' opinions. 

*Also a side note on skins: I think skins would be a great idea as long as they don't do what CS:GO did and make them trade-able. If the game were to get skins they should only be obtainable through actual stats so skins could actually equal wins. It would be cool to be able to flaunt your badass looking sniper rifle to show off the fact you are a skilled player.*",FortNiteBR

1. You're slowed down when you swing so another pickaxe player can just infinitely run away after 1 swing.

2. Opponents with guns with full HP will pretty much always kill you even if they stand still (~11 dmg so you need 10 hits on a full hp opponent)

3. Pickaxe's viability as a weapon is such a small window currently: desperate situations right after you land and can't find a weapon. **Once everyone has weapons, it's usage as a weapon essentially drops to 0%.**

It's used only as a joke without any practical function. IMO, if a player can land 5 pick axe swings on any full hp opponent, I feel they *should* be rewarded with the kill. 10 hits is way too much for any viability. ",FortNiteBR

I disagree, but it's kind of irrelevant. You thinking Kaplan is a piece of shit for what he did as Tigole over a decade ago doesn't somehow nullify the rest of my points, or, honestly, even what he said. Just because he did it doesn't mean it's okay for everyone else to do nor does it make him a permanent asshole. The Tigole post was also far more humorous than what some people do today, as evidenced by the people sending *me* pretty disgusting PMs.

---

For just over a week, it seems like the toxicity or entitlement in players has been growing exponentially, especially when it is channeled toward the development team.

The team addresses issues insanely quickly. They realize what a fantastic game they've put together. They aren't going to just fuck their own shit up like other companies might. However, this awesome trait is also a vulnerability for them.

After that fucking ridiculous post about hitmarker removal, which is another topic all on its own (seriously? 300 upvotes and 4k views means EPIC is obligated to respond? fuck off), I realize the vocal minority has reached a new level of disrespect. The post gained some traction and the OP ***edited it calling out EPIC for not responding within SEVENTEEN hours***. It seems to have been an isolated peak of entitlement, but that's how it starts.

Per Overwatch's lead, Jeff Kaplan:  
&gt;And if you'll allow me to speak openly for a moment — it's scary. Overall, the community is awesome to us. But there are some pretty mean people out there. All of our developers are free to post on these forums. Very few of us actually do because it's extremely intimidating and/or time consuming. It's very easy to post the wrong thing and make a ""promise"" to the community that no one intended to make. Once we say we're working on something, we're not allowed to ""take it back"". It's set in stone.

&gt;Also, because we are open with you and do not hide behind an anonymous handle (like all of you have the luxury of doing), we often times get personally attacked and threatened.

&gt;Most great developers I know just love being head's down making or playing games. The ""public speaking/posting"" part of the job is downright scary and intimidating. It often feels like there is no winning.

People with major confirmation bias take any positive response (i.e. ""We'll send this to the development team!"") as 100% guarantee it will happen immediately. Any negative news or lack of response is treated with disgust, anger, and hatefulness. Kaplan has also said this toxicity toward other players and *toward the devs* literally **slows down development**. EPIC will surely face the same issues if it doesn't stop early.

On top of all this, the devs are **people** with other responsibilities. They have other tasks to do at work aside from following every fucking post. They spend most of that time, you know, developing the game. So when people get upset about ""SEVENTEEN HOURS NO RESPONSE I DEMAND THE ANSWERS YOU **OWE** US REEEE"", you are literally demanding that they STOP FIXING YOUR COMPLAINTS. 

If they respond to someone else's post, don't respond to them and start asking them other questions. That's off-topic and a waste of everyone's time. Use the search function or Google. People post the same fucking stuff every day, begging or demanding answers, when they've already been given! 

Cosmetics are on the way, stop fucking begging and demanding for them. They know consistency between weapons is a little off or undesirable right now, they're working on it. Stop nagging the issue. They have 100% seen and noted the issue regarding console inventory controls, we don't need a ""new and interesting"" idea on how to fix it every single day. Just because there has not been an official statement on an issue doesn't mean it hasn't been noted. Again, use the search function or google. Seriously.

As I felt compelled to remind some people, they have other things to do, but we know they check this sub every so often, likely every day or every other day. They are listening, but sometimes the best way to listen is simply to take in what someone is saying rather than respond to every little point and every detail. 

Have some patience and some sense. Be excellent to each other, including to the EPIC team, who has been excellent to us. At the end of the day, this is *their* game, not ours. If they don't want to make it to please every single person, they absolutely do not have to, just as you absolutely do not have to continue playing if you don't like what they do.

Anyway, this post is obviously not geared toward the majority of people commenting or posting in this sub. But some of you seriously need to reevaluate your approach to voicing complaints or opinions, because you act like fucking spoiled children. It makes all of us look bad, which, like in the case of Overwatch's dev team, can make people afraid to communicate with us at all.",FortNiteBR

This makes me so damn salty. Almost every solo game I play it's just people too scared to run around on a video game, they camp in a house and kill me when I go in because I don't expect people to camp on a f2p game. 

So this goes out to people who play like this.

**1) Learn the combat.**

When new to this game you should consider engaging in combat as much as you can. While this will most likely result in a few losses, you will learn a lot. You’ll get to know the different types of weapons, their recoil and you will get a better understanding of the flow of combat.
Doing this will make sure you are prepared to defend yourself when you need to. Surviving until the end game without firing a shot is very doable, but if you don’t know how to use your weapons the best way, you won’t win much.

**2) Choose your landing position wisely.**

Most people will tell you to stay away from the big areas like Retail Row or Pleasant Park, however, it all depends on the game you’re in. Everyone is advising people to stay away from those popular areas. If everyone is following that advice, those areas will be empty, right?
Decide your tactic before jumping. Will you dive down as quickly as possible, get first hand on weapons and stand your ground? Or will you aim for the outskirts and go for the sneaky approach.
Always look around you while landing to see who’s around you.

**3) Get your shopping list.**

After landing you have a few priorities to take care of. Try to find an Assault rifle, Sniper rifle, Bandages and Shield potions. Shotguns definitely serve their purpose as well, although in my opinion, less beneficial than an Assault rifle.

All other stuff you find are good as well of course, but could be more classed as luxury to help you forward.

**4) Get recourses to build. And don’t forget to build!**

If you come from PUBG you might actually forget about this but in Fortnite you can build walls, floors, slopes and roofs.
It’s important to stock on wood, stone and metal early on. When getting jumped on by surprise, building a few walls for your protection might just save your life. It’s also very useful to build some walls when reviving.

In the end game it’ll be vital to have these resources to build a base if needed.

Also, don’t forget building can help you reach places you normally can’t. Think of reaching higher mountain tops with building slopes, or even build a pathway next to a mountain to avoid being exposed.

**5) Use headphones.**

Footsteps are loud in Fortnite Battle Royale. When paying attention to the sound around you, you might just get the advantage.

The golden chests give an indistinct sound when nearby, so make sure you go and investigate.

**6) Learn the map.**

While it’s true that a chest spawn on a certain location isn’t guaranteed, you will definitely benefit if you know where to look a bit. Learn where chests most likely spawn and learn where the good loot areas are.  Less popular areas offer loads of goodies as well.
I’m working on a detailed map that I’ll discuss in a later video.

**7) You don’t NEED to kill.**

You’re not playing Deathmatch. This is about surviving. You don’t need to kill every person you see. If you’re not sure you’ll get a kill when you attack, you should either get into a better position or let them be all together.
Hiding in a bush might not be the most elegant thing, but it can be a life saver.

**8) Use your pick when looting dead enemies.**

When NOT equipping your pick, you will pick up everything including weapons. Using your pick while looting will make sure you pick up all items apart from weapons. Once done you can start to swap out weapons.

**9) Movement and Crouching.**

Crouching will make your footsteps less loud and you’ll also have better accuracy with your weapons. Apply when needed.

When running it’s a good idea to not always run in a straight line. Try to add some jumping to the mix. This will make you a harder target for lurking snipers.
Same applies for when in combat. When in a close range duel with a shotgun, the odd jump might throw off somebody’s aim. It’ll also get you easier headshots if your aim is up to par.

**10) Do the extra mile for supply drops.**

Supply drops are the balloons that come down from the sky and land on the blue smoke. While they might seem far, it’s worth checking out as they will most likely hold something valuable. Protect yourself with some walls while waiting for one.

**11) Find a play style that works for you.**

There are 2 main tactics you can use. You can get to the middle of the circle as quickly as possible and stand your ground, or you can move along the edge of the circle.

Both, or a combination of the two, work really good if executed well.

**12) Everything is destructible**

Think outside of the box. You don’t always have to use the front door. If you think people are camping inside a house, build some slopes and try an approach from the roof or smash your way in through a side wall. While not without risk, doing something unexpected will catch people off guard.

Also, when people build cover and you’re well stocked on ammo or you have a rocket launcher or grenades, that cover can easily be destroyed and leave your enemy exposed.

**13) Use downed enemies as bait.**

When playing duo’s or squad it might be useful to not finish off that downed enemy straight away. Their teammates might go and try to revive which leaves them exposed. Perfect for a surprise attack.

**14) When safe, eliminate with pickaxe.**

When you downed somebody and the area is clear, safe your ammunition and finish off that poor soul with your pickaxe. He won’t mind.

**15) Aim for the bulls eye when collecting materials**

The bulls eye you see when smashing walls, tree’s, cars and what not are actually a little minigame. Hitting the bulls eye will do more damage and thus destroy the material quicker which means you make noise less longer.


**16) Height gives advantage.**

People building high stairs is something you’ll see often, and there’s a good reason. Height gives you a very big advantage in the game. It’s easier to shoot from a higher position and difficult for the person below you to get a good shot at you.
At the same time you’ll have a better overview of the map.

I'm not sure how many people know this, but anyways, since there is still Cross-play between PS4 and PC at the moment, something my friends and i have noticed is that the location of bushes are different between the two. This means that if you hide in a bush on PC for example, to a PS4 player it looks like you are out in the open (the same occurs for PS4 to PC).

That can make shotgun challenges really frustrating as their shield absorbs shell after shell and they one pump you. Yes I know.... git gud.

But wondering if being able to craft shield potions could potentially help balance things out (ala H1Z1)..... or maybe having shields have some kind of visual queue. Would also be nice for squads to know who to shoot first if one guy does and one guy doesn't have a shield, etc..

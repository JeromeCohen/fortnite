Basically, my PC has the specs to run Fortnite. It can run BF4 and other games that require performance. When I open Fortnite, it gets to the first loading screen and stays there loaded to about 95&amp;#37; of the way. After that nothing happens. It just stays there. I check task manager and it says its not responding. I've had this problem since before season 3 started. I've searched the internet and it seems there is a few people that have this problem but Epic doesn't seem to want to reply. If there has been and I'm mistaken please feel free to correct me.

I was playing 50v50 last night and decided I wanted to build massive structures in the circle to get my team involved in building a huge base.

That's when it hit me, my right finger starting to tighten up kind of like a cramp from all the whacking of trees, rocks, cars etc....


Is there / Why is there not (if it doesn't exist) and auto harvest button or setting? I guess it would be a setting and you could set it up kind of like sprinting. Double click or double pull the trigger (I play XBOX) to enable auto harvesting. I like to build in ALL game modes and I find myself harvesting quite a bit throughout my gaming sessions.

The main intention was season 4 was to change up the map and gameplay, it certainly did that, but not in a good way. Dusty Divot and Risky Reels, biggest changes of the season. Dusty Divot at first seemed like a cool drop spot, but after a few days it panned out to be Dusty Depot with a larger area, and a bit more loot. My main issue with Dusty Divot, it’s a massive death zone just like it was before. The area between Tilted, Loot, Dusty, and Salty. You enter Divot, you’ve immediately sacrificed high ground for a good 1-5 minutes and are prone to multiple teams attacking you at once. This is not a fun change, the Hop Rocks are alright, but it doesn’t change you made the worst spot ever to exist in Fortnite. It’s also so big, everytime I land Motel-Risky, I find most of the time we have to go down through zone through Divot, it’s a big unavoidable shooting fest where nobody wins. Risky Reels is a decent place, enough loot for its size and houses nearby to head to, but the zone is a complete gamble and with the amount of people that head there, if you don’t catch people off guard, you most likely won’t walk out with full health. It got turned into full-on Tilted during with week 7, with people trying to get blockbuster and it’s ruined Risky for most people. It doesn’t offer much new though as one of those outer edge places we didn’t really need but guess we are okay with. Mansion is just there to fill the space between Racetrack and Lonely, again not necessary, but okay I guess.

The items, oh boy the items. Going to get the good item changes spots out of the way, these are Burst Assault Rifle, Shopping Carts, and Bouncers. The Jetpack is the single worst thing they’ve ever put in this game, not even the bush is as horrid as this one thing. This not that it’s so awful that it’s bad. It’s so disgustingly overpowered it’s bad. I’m thankful now it’s back in the vault where it belongs. It’s like constantly having a bouncer or hop rock on you that you can just activate anytime you please. It negates fall damage, it negates you building to get the high ground it does everything better and for the worse. It wasn’t even that hard to get, I got at least 2 from chests in an average game. Never bring this back.
Thermal Scoped Assault Rifle, it’s okay, but there isn’t much reason to use it over a regular Scoped Assault Rifle, the thermal ability is useless without the addition of smoke grenades and it has a slower fire rate + clip size than the Scoped Assault Rifle. Stink Bomb is annoying to deal with, but it’s not the end of the world, and it’s not going to kill you unless you’re downed. Dual pistols are a powerful component, if you can hit your shots, it’s basically a semi-sniper in a close range gun that really is going to be outplayed by something like a shotgun or SMG, there’s a reason many of these are left on the ground. Drum Gun is a bit too powerful in my eyes, the accuracy is great for every first shot, it’s outclasses outer SMGs in close range and competes with mid-range guns (kind of like another gun I’ll get into). Apples and Mushrooms are just... what? If you want to play a game of food Wack-A-Mole you can spent the next 2 minutes grinding up mushrooms or apples to get full health/shield.",FortNiteBR

Simplest option:  offer a SBMM LTM for a week and see what people think.  Epic will know what % of people are choosing it and can determine its future based on actual stats rather than on reddit pitchforks.

How would it work:  ""skill"" rating is based on your most recent 100 games K/D ratio.  

Epic will obviously determine where the breakdown is in terms of specific ranks.  They have all this data available to determine what groups to create to assure matches still fill very quickly.  

The main area I see this being a major boon to Fortnite is in random squads / duos.  Yes - I have friends I play with.  But I also like to play randoms for the simplicity of it.  SBMM would dramatically improve the experience of randoms.

In addition - I have to believe that SBMM would greatly improve noob retention.  If I was a noob in game right now - there is no way I'd be sticking around.

Having to level account to lvl 80 to unlock battle pass skin completely was really bad decision.

      I imagine a lot of people missed it. I got 84 playing quite a bit and with 3 friends too. Someone playing casually everyday 1-2 hours with no friends propably cant unlock it at all.

Not to mention that it was not stated anywhere beforehand that you need lvl 80. Googling it should not be the case considering previous lvl 100 unlock was just a bunch of challenges.

        So basically what happens is: You get lvl 100 battlepass, wake up that you are only level 49 and need 31 more levels to unlock lvl 100 battlepass skin details, lights and colours.

       Reaching battlepass 100 makes stars give regular exp, but its minor. 1000exp for daily quest, 1000exp for full star from challanges, 200exp from level up. Its certainly not enough to push someone over.

[Not a rant],"To be honest, I started playing Fortnite around the beginning of season 2. Since then, it’s been pretty much all I’ve played and I’ve loved it so much it got me to start streaming on Twitch. However, after about 1200 hours of play or so since then, I am pretty burnt out and overall bored of the game.

Sure, Epic adds new stuff every week but most of the time it’s not that game changing, the only thing that’s different now is double shotgun isn’t as rampant as it used to be and people are instead gunning you down with mp5’s from 100+ meters.

I really really hope Epic adds a totally new map because otherwise I don’t know how much of the current map I have left in me, the changes will get pretty boring after the first few days and getting to explore a whole new map would refresh the game so much for me.

Again this isn’t a rant, Epic has done a fantastic job with this game but playing around 2,000 games on the same BR map for 7-8 months with only some minor changes to the map is guaranteed to get tire some after that amount of time. ",FortNiteBR

That is especially true in duo/squad fights, where you can basically deny opponents from building/taking high ground for a good 15 seconds with just 3 C4s, at the same time with very little effort/punishment. You don't have to deal with the bounce of grenades and you can instantly detonate it from the safety of your own cover. 

A 3-5 second timer before detonation needs to be implented to make it way less spammy. C4s are supposed to be utility items. It will still work as intended as a counter to turtles/house campers. They are still forced to react to the placement of C4s (i.e. editing out of the 1x1). It just stops the mindless left click right click spam fest.

The perfect change, in my opinion, would be a 3-5 second timer, reduced stack size to maximum of 6, decrease explosive range, can only be thrown one at a time and add damage to player behind walls at 70 damage. This would make it a very good turtle counter that needs to be used strategically.

And the people at the site are truly programmed NPCs also teleported from the game. 

So, at some point, the burger is going to teleport again and anyone in the anomaly zone will also disappear and be taken into Fortnite.

Yes it had it's uses; Cover to revive your friends in the middle of a fight, as a distraction, to block the enemies sight or just as a meme to annoy your friends with. With the combination of the thermal scoped ar a new strategy could come into play. Place a smoke on you while in a 1by1 and pick people off with your thermal scoped ar. 

The way the smoke grenades worked were essentially the same as normal grenades. It would bounce around before ""exploding"". If epic changed it so that it would ""explode"" on impact peopld would definitely start using the smoke grenades.

 The way I see a lot of fights is a bunch of building and then one person spamming your walls with a lmg/Minigun/Tommy gun (how many spammy weapons do we need geez) Sometimes 'just build lol' just can't counter it but throw a few smokes down, heal up and suprise the enemy.

(Also for people who suggest use stink grenades, the are rarer than smoke grenades and are difficult to use for defensive in some cases such as hiding to heal yourself/others.)

With season 5 just around the corner how about we give the smoke grenade another chance and bloody fix dusty divot.",FortNiteBR

- add a large pile of garbage to the ocean to represent the real life floating garbage patch
- add a long trail of black smoke from the battle bus 
- have the chimneys in industrial places produce black smoke 
- remove all the food growing in the fields of anarchy acres and  fatal fields

I was thinking about the Rocket Launch and thought it would be cool if they did something for Season 4's end. It would end with everybody playing having their game crash. To give context for the game, this is assuming that the Update and downtime will happen at 4 AM EST. To clarify, I do not work for Epic, nor am I saying that this is what I predict will happen/will happen.


Anyways, a few hours before the inevitable, the crack would get so big, it would start dropping stuff and shooting rifts at people and possibly killing them, like the Meteor shooting little Meteorites off a few days before Season 4. At around 1 to 2 AM EST, everywhere affected by rifts at all would have mini-rifts that take your mats slowly (with the nerfs, who needs them anyways?), and possibly damage you if you get too close. 3 AM EST, the true show begins.


At this point, the sky is pure black, and the crack is constantly expanding. Things appearing everywhere, chests, buildings, Llamas, Carts, random objects, even PEOPLE would get zapped out of games. Buildings? Be wary. 50-45 minutes before 4, rifts start taking whole unnamed locations affected by the map change. Once there, those rifts consume the location, and stay there. At the same time, more random rifts appear, exploding out of nowhere. These do disappear once that match is up. Getting caught in any rift ""explosions"" instantly crashes the game/closes it. Modes will disappear around 30 minutes until 4, until only one remains at 20 minutes, but no weapons will spawn and you physically cannot die. 15 minutes until, rifts will appear over named locations getting affected by the map change, and at 10 minutes will explode. At 5 until, the game itself will start ""glitching"", the HUD breaking, camera shaking until 4 minutes, when the HUD disappears and the camera starts to crack, and pieces chip off. At 3 minutes all hell breaks loose from the crack. Things pouring out (these actually killing people), earthquakes happening, the ground literally exploding and getting sucked into the crack, some players may not touch the ground, gravity lessens, people will fly. 2 Minutes, Camera cracks getting faster, some players getting kicked off, and alarms starting. 10 minutes ago, anyone not on could no longer start the game.


The final minute, places blink in and out of existence, players look nothing like anything recognizable, things breaking, everything looks distorted, you can't see at all, the camera starts to shatter and...


The game crashes, and the downtime begins. Nothing for Season 5 will show until downtime ends. Once updated and ran during the update, a title card will say...


#Did you pay attention?


And the game will close...



**TL;DR: Read it, trust me, it's worth your time.



I want to remind that this is just an idea that developed while typing this! I don't work for Epic, and I am not saying at ALL that this is what I predict to happen/will happen. This is just some fun idea I had, I hope you enjoyed it, tell me how it sucked and how it could be made better.

So what if anyone who has Omega unlock like me, and did reach level 80 were able to unlock the styles specifically by reaching level 80 next season?

Why do Fortnite players judge people based on a mere aesthetic purchase? It is clear that the amount of money that someone has does not have any correlation with skill in a game such as Fortnite so why? 

I’ve played over 1500 hours of CS:GO, an FPS also with skins, and people only meme about skins actually meaning skill but Fortnite is different. It’s a different community that thinks completely differently. I have friends that play both and judge in Fortnite but not in CS. This topic has always got me riled up and I would like to get the the bottom of it.

Me personally do not judge, I have met many players without a skin with a formidable amount of skill, well over me, and found others with significantly less skill without a different skin on. I want to start this discussion because I never have followed this and plan on never doing so. Let me know yourself, why do Fortnite players do this in particular?

The amount of effort it takes to even damage people is absurd at times. Even with the rocket buff and different good changes they've made lately, people can just build and build and build and never shoot back until either they run out of mats or you're out of ammo.

Of course, this should be viewed solely as my opinion so feel free to voice your opinion as well! Yes, I am that bored.

Instead of going through all the basketball and soccer skins, I've lumped them all into one, though I will say that Triple Threat, Finesse Finisher and Poised Playmaker were my favorites by far!

* 35) **Diecast**

Reasoning: A decent idea, just not very appealing in my view.

* 34) **Chromium**

Reasoning: A decent idea, just not very appealing in my view.

* 33) **Flytrap**

Reasoning: Very unique, however the colors are strange and no back bling is very disappointing.

* 32) **Star-Spangled Trooper**

Reasoning: A decent event outfit but easily forgettable.

* 31) **Scoundrel**

Reasoning: To see Jonesy with a stache is pretty funny but overall it's pretty horrendous. Back bling isn't bad.

* 30) **Battlehawk**

Reasoning: A decent entry skin for the season but easily forgettable. 

* 29) **Star-Spangled Ranger**

Reasoning: A decent event outfit but easily forgettable.

* 28) **Toxic Trooper**

* 27) **Hazard Agent**

Reasoning: Not terrible but also not that good. The TV shaped head is off-putting.

* 26) **Squad Leader**

Reasoning: Not horrible but definitely not good enough to warrant the spot of second last of the BP.

* 25) **Fireworks Team Leader**

Reasoning: Decent but not that exciting with the Cuddle Team Leader having been around for longer.

* 24) **Basketball Players**

Reasoning: Decent skins for sure! 

* 23) **Soccer Players**

Reasoning: I think it's awesome how these brought some new characters to the game but overall they're good, not great.

* 22) **Liteshow**

Reasoning: I like it, I just don't love it.

* 21) **Omen**

Reasoning: Great concept but very poor execution. The cape saves it and is arguably in the top three back bling of the game.

* 20) **Trailblazer**

Reasoning: I like it, I just don't love it.

* 19) **Nitelite**

Reasoning: I think the female is a bit better than the male. Overall a decent skin.

* 18) **Sleuth**

Reasoning: The weakest of the detectives but overall not a bad skin.

* 17) **Criterion**

Reasoning: Resembles a tide pod and a gillette fusion razer. If you can get past that it is far from the worst skin.

* 16) **Zoey**

Reasoning: A good outfit but after a couple dozen games I lost interest in it.

* 15) **Bandolier**

Reasoning: Black Rambo is pretty good, just not my cup of tea.

* 14) **Rapscallion**

Reasoning: A great simple design and a pretty good execution. Back bling is solid.

* 13) **Carbide**

Reasoning: A great introduction to the season. Unique appearance and customizable lights is a big plus.

* 12) **Abstrakt**

Reasoning: Yes, his legs are skinny. If you can get past that it's actually a badass skin in my opinion.

* 11) **Gumshoe**

Reasoning: A clean skin with a decent back bling. Love the hair and glasses!

* 10) **Valor**

Reasoning: Despite having slightly manly features, her color design and hair is superb in my view. Looks more feminine on the loading screen.

* 9) **Vertex**

Reasoning: I love the Barry Allen vibes from this guy's pickaxe. Back bling is very unique but the face isn't great.

* 8) **Noir**

Reasoning: The best of the detectives in terms of design. The stache, dark trench coat and glasses make it a pretty good skin.

* 7) **Sky Stalker**

Reasoning: I love the gas mask and simplicity of this one.

* 6) **Venturion**

Reasoning: With the newly added cape this was one of the better skins this season.

* 5) **Ventura**

Reasoning: This one got a lot of hate at first but I actually really like it. The newly added cape is a bit better than the male's cape.

* 4) **Fate**

Reasoning: A blend of Star Wars and Assassin's Creed. Face is a tad bit off but the overall design and back bling are great.

* 3) **Teknique**

Reasoning: A staple of the fourth season. Despite its popularity, it's still one of the most solid designs.

* 2) **Oblivion**

Reasoning: The final skin of the season. The back bling looks weird, but the Catwoman vibes coupled with the spiked shoulders and sleek design makes this one of my favorite outfits of the season. I'll be using this one for a while.

* 1) **Omega**

Reasoning: This outfit gives me Crysis vibes and I think is the strongest skin of the season. Overall a very badass skin with the menacing helmet and strong color customization options.",FortNiteBR

This was a good amount of damage- not too much, and not too little. Someone with 150 health could survive a trap long time ago. 

Then, Epic nerfed traps into oblivion, and after a collective outroar from the community, reverted the nerf and buffed traps to 150

The problem with traps at 150 damage is that they can kill or render someone incapacitated too quickly. A lot of players run around with only minishields for healing and sit at 150 health most of the time. I think the idea that an item can hurt 75% of someone’s health is unbalanced. 

Traps also activate super quickly; someone can throw a trap underneath you and you wont have enough time to clear the area. Traps should have a longer “incubation” period before they are ready. Obviously walking into a trap thats been laid is the player’s fault, but what i think is broken is the ability to throw a trap right on someone and they have no chance of escape that trap unless they shoot the trap instantly (which is borderline impossible unless you have spidey senses)

My proposition is that the trap should either return to 125 damage, or it should take longer to arm. Epic really ruined the “goldilocks” state of the traps by making them too strong.

It sucks early game when someone gets a rocket launcher and you are dead immediately. It sucks how rockets or any splodes can practically destroy your whole structure (specifically c4's and rocket launchers) and if two or more players use explosives on you, it would be safe to say your dead because of all the splash damage and destruction upon your build. You could easily build but it's so annoying to build a 1x1 and use so much wood only to have it destroyed with a single rocket or explosive. There was a clip where Liquid POACH showed on stream how many walls/floors one rocket can destroy, I can't recall properly but it was absurd...not 100% sure if it's true but I heard the clinger can damage you through a wall that it's on and you're opposite of, probably makes sense but still...it pains me how it still does 100 damage no matter how far you are, as long as you're in the radius, but yet the radius is pretty big from my experience.

Lonely lodge will slowly disappear until the only thing left is trees and the tower. More dinosaur footprints will be scattered around lonely and plants will grow all over it will be renamed Jurassic Jungle. The tower will have vines hanging from it and what was once the lodge will soon be a cave with Dino eggs. A cave will also be found behind the small waterfall, linked to the one with the eggs. Chests can be found by the cave, in the tower or behind the waterfall. Oh and there will also be dinosaurs.

The motel will disappear and become the Wild West location and the motel will become a saloon. By the saloon there will be a Jail. The jail is a small room about the size of the old motel. The carriages, dead animals, and horses will be littered around the area and the train rails with train and saloon will have chests and ammo boxes.

The Large Soccer field will become the pyramids of Giza and the lion statue that is at the pyramids will be the Sphinx. The pyramids are accessible through every side and the top. The Sphinx can only be accessed from its behind. Giant sand dunes will also be around the area. Chest and ammo boxes can be found in all areas I mentioned above.

Pirates Point will replace Moisty Mire There will be Pirate ships all on the sand and a pirate camp, filled with (decor) gold,skulls,canons, and a cave you can enter and loot. The boats and cave will have chests.

Luck Landing will be removed due to it being a seasonally themed location. It will be replaced with captive castle. A castle with walls around it. The castle has an armoury with swords and stables for horses. Chest and ammo boxes will be found around the area.

Animals will be added into the Battle Royals Universe. All animals are just like decorations. They are blocking you from walking through them and can it be broken.

A T-Rex will be standing at Jurassic Jungle (Lonely Lodge) and a Pterodactyl will fly around the tower.

Horses will trot around the Wild West (Motel) saloon and can be seen tied to post outside of the saloon and jail.

Camels will roam around the pyramids and over the dunes. (Large soccer stadium)

Parrots will fly around Pirates Point and land on the trees,boats and caves.

Haunted hills will have bats flying around it.

Fatal Fields / Anarchy Acres will hold cows / sheep in the barns and horses in the stables.

The tier 100 skin will be the Flying Dutchman. The official skin name is “The Cursed Captain” and the tier 1 skin is “The Explorer” who is and Indiana Jones like skin.

One of the tier skins is the Time Traveller Scientist (no official name yet) and he will be the one trying to close the portals.

\- The runner must survive until the end of the round (or until the storm kills someone).

\- If the runner dies for any reason, the 3 hunters win.  

\- The runner can jump from the bus at any point, however the 3 hunters must ride the bus to the end (but can skydive anywhere after that). 

\- The runner must mark the nearest named location to them - not specific location - every 5 minutes.  The non-specific vs. specific location marker helps prevent any problems when a hunter dies and ends up spectating the runner.  

Like I said I’d welcome any feedback - let me know if anyone has any other ideas that work for you or you have found fun - this playground mode is great and we love looking for challenging things to implement. ",FortNiteBR

Then just wait for people to die, do something else whilst the game runs. 

When the storm starts to come in and you need to move, use your environment for cover, so bushes and trees, outhouses and also the storm, I like to use the storm for cover, dipping in and out.

Now you have to watch your squad wonder around and that’s kinda boring.

Obviously this is only a minor gripe and there are for more important issues that need to be addressed like bloom and people magically phasing through your structures, but I’d like to give possible solutions to the problem.

*Warning*
Opinions 

1: 
just build lol

2:
Make it near impossible to eliminate a downed player, provided that they have a teammate nearby, I’m not sure of a suitable distance but that can always be tested. I don’t think you should be 100% invincible though, I feel traps and fall damage should still eliminate a downed player. This rewards a squad for sticking together and punishes those people who stray off to do their own thing.

3:
My friend suggested that a downed player should receive a large amount of shield (~500/1000) when they go down, so they still bleed out in the same amount of time, but require a lot of shots to be eliminated. This may put players off eliminating downed players to save ammo and time etc.

Like I said, this is only a minor gripe, I’d like to hear your guys’ opinions on the subject and see your possible solutions.

To those people, I have two words for you: Fuck. Off.

While it isn't your *main* objective persay, its an objective nonetheless. Its something you can *do* other than win the game. I agree, its mainly a survival game, but if you're gonna sit there and tell me that the no-skin who did nothing but hide in a bush all game should get more XP than the guy who got 21 kills then you seriously need some help. Here's a simple fix: Increase the XP for your first kill to 100, and increase the XP per kill after that to 50, like last season. This would give that guy I talked about earlier 1100 XP just for his kills, much more than the default who did nothing but move to the new zone every game.

I've been thinking that epic should make purchasable levels in the shop similar to teirs. I wouldnt think they would do too much but maybe just 3 levels for 800-900 vbucks, as 5 seems like maybe just a bit much. They could do this just for the people who are busy and cant finish grinding or are just on the final stretch. I want to suggest to epic games to do this, and start a discussion as to what people think of this idea, how many levels, etc. (though honestly there are like 3 days left, idk if any coding is required for this and if there's a problem using the battlepass level logo specifically for the shop, whatever I don't know how these things work.)",FortNiteBR

**ISSUE: The Push To Talk button stops working after 1 game**.  

Easy to reproduce, just play two games in a row.  PTT works in the first game, then not at all in the second.  Restart Fortnite and it will work again ... for one game.

The workaround -- must be done after EVERY GAME -- is to go into settings, disable voice chat, click apply, and re-enable voice chat (and apply again).  And sometimes you need to do it multiple times to fix the issue.

* This has nothing to do with making sure the proper audio input / outputs are selected in Windows / nothing to do with default communication device etc
* This is unrelated to the separate issue where the Push to Talk key bind is missing (in which the solution is to change controller types, weirdly enough)
* Selecting voice input / output device in game similarly doesn't matter 
* Disabling ""exclusive mode"" on the device doesn't seem to help, either
* This bug *may* have been introduced in the 4.3 update 

Epic, please, please fix this.  Or does someone know a workaround?  

This is happening on a brand new ASUS gaming desktop with almost nothing but Windows 10 and Fortnite installed.  Restarting Fortnite fixes the problem for 1 game.  Doing the workaround above fixes it ... for one game.  

The workaround is clunky and time-consuming and I've had squad mates quit the game because I didn't respond to ""got a mic?"" in time while I'm busy changing settings.

I'm not even asking for you to revert shotguns to their original state...I'm asking for you guys to buff pump and tactical shotguns more. You guys can do what you will with this...but you guys broke your game with the nerf to shotguns...i know you all won't agree but come on...I died to someone with a gray assault rifle because my shotgun only did 85 headshot...like that shouldn't make any sense💔,FortNiteBR

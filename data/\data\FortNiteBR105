3,MrPopoTFS,1548807308,al6pas,371,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/al6pas/reverted_new_ping_calculation_method/,1,Reverted New Ping Calculation Method,"Hey folks,

We've seen some questions regarding lower ping levels (including 0) displayed in the UI as well as the Connection Timeout error being displayed, even while under good network conditions. We wanted to drop by and give a little bit of clarity around what's going on here. 

&amp;nbsp;

You may have seen the following line in the v7.30 Patch Notes:

* Fixed an issue in the Net Debug UI that would cause it to show a ping value that was too high. 

&amp;nbsp;

We discovered an issue with our current method of calculating ping that was causing displayed ping values to **sometimes** be higher than those the player was actually receiving. 

&amp;nbsp;

This was creating instances where the ping values displayed weren't indicative or representative of what the player was actually experiencing. In v7.30 we began testing a new method of calculating ping, which should display numbers with a more accurate value to the player's connection to a server. Separately, we also added an indicator to the UI to display a “Connection Lost” notification when under poor network conditions.

&amp;nbsp;

However, we’ve seen your reports that the “Connection Lost” message is displaying even under good conditions, that some players are seeing pings values of 0, and that FPS can have a direct effect on the displayed ping value. Due to this, we’ve decided to temporarily revert these changes so we can polish out the remaining kinks before adding thing back in.

&amp;nbsp;

Once we’re ready to add these changes back in, we’ll also provide a more technical and detailed blog on this new Ping Calculation method and how it works. We look forward to your questions and feedback once that blog is ready!

This would make the skin at least usable for the people without the lights already while still keeping OGs happy I think? LMK what you guys think. I would like to hear the opinion of both people with and without the lights. I definitely think people who grinded their butts off should be rewarded, although I don't think people who did not should be completely screwed over. Same with Carbide challenges, although I think most people maxed Carbide. Please keep discussion civil though.

First: loads of fun.  
Second: I suck so bad at this. Seriously. I may be the worst gamer that ever lived. This is really making me feel OLD. Although, I bet most of you in here and playing the game are like 10 years old. And every single one of you could most likely kick my ass. - no , not most likely. Definitely. There was an SNL sketch about fortnite a few months back. The old gamer in the sketch may have more gaming skills than I do.  


So my request is this. Be nice to us old farts who haven't a clue how to do this well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would be nice if when you joined a match, it paired you up with 99 other players with similar skill levels based on your stats. As your stats improve you play against the better players.   


Game is still fun, but would be more fun if I could kill more than one other player ever 10 games. :D

&amp;#x200B;

Thirsting is part of the game yes. And everybody does it yes. 

Pro: Thirsting is a good only for specific times. Killing a downed enemy when their team is nearby/ or you're fighting them, and you need to eliminate them so they don't stand up and fight you again. Killing them for their mats, ammo, and weapon. It's also really tactful too, Keeping an enemy alive will likely get the enemy's team frenzied and trying to get their teammate back up. I know I am like that, the more teammates alive with me... the more secured a victory royal is.

Con: But it makes absolutely no sense to thirst a person with no weapon, especially early game, when everyone just landed. They have no mats, no weapon, Nothing. They have nothing. You're just ruining their game to get that one free kill you hardly did anything for. 

&amp;#x200B;

I stated my pros and cons, I want to see whether you guys agree with me, or disagree. And I would like to know why

Or rather, building needs a massive nerf. (Long read)","In this post I will explain why Fortnites building mechanic are hurting the game and how it's analogous to the NBA 3pt line in basketball.

In short, building has become way too powerful and it's diminishing the amount of tactical and combat variety found in Fortnite.

I'll start with the NBA 3 pt line which was introduced to the NBA in 1979.  That year, each team averaged 2.8 3 pt shots per game.  10 years later, in 1989, each team averaged 6.6 three point attempts per game.  In 1999 teams were shooting 13.7 three point shots per game.  Today, teams are shooting a whopping 31.3 three point shots per game.  Nearly all basketball junkies predict that three point attempts per game are only going to increase in the next 10 years because analytically, teams still aren't shooting enough.

Why are 3 pt shot attempts increasing?  Because teams are catching on the this one fact...

Shooting a 3 pt shot at 35.2% rate (league average) nets you significantly more points than shooting a 2 pt shot at 48% (league average) clip.  3 points are worth 50% more than 2 points.

Now to those of you who don't follow the NBA, there is rising sentiment in NBA circles that the 3 pt shot is bad for the game.  It's homogonizing the league.  Every team knows that the three ball is vastly superior to the 2 pt shot that teams and offenses are now being constructed the exact same way.  In the 80s and 90s, some NBA teams were constructed vastly different than other teams because coaches didn't realize the value of the 3.  Some teams were big and slow.  Some teams were small and fast.  Some teams would play close to the basket while others would look for 3pt shots.  Today it's all the same.  No one looks to build their team around the 2pt shot.

Gregg Popovich, arguably the most respected and admired NBA coach in the history of the NBA, had this to say about the 3 point shot...

""These days there’s such an emphasis on the three because it’s proven to be analytically correct,” Popovich offered with what appeared to be a sneer. “Now you look at a stat sheet after a game and the first thing you look at is the threes. If you made threes and the other team didn’t, you win. You don’t even look at the rebounds or the turnovers or how much transition D was involved. You don’t even care. That’s how much an impact the three-point shot has and it’s evidenced by how everybody plays.""

Now how does this relate to Fortnite?

Back in Seasons 1 - 3, the presence of building was significantly smaller than it is today.  Players either didn't know how powerful it was, or they weren't good at employing the mechanic.  Today that's no longer the case.  

What we saw in those early seasons was a more balanced game.  The amount of variety in engagements was at an all time high.  The AR was a beast back then, but so was the scoped AR, and the sniper rifle.  Players would get a balanced amount of kills from all three engagement distances.

Fast forward to today, and a skilled player doesn't even need to carry an AR or a sniper rifle.  A skilled player can just willy nilly hop out in the open, hoping to get shot at by anyone, and ramp rush the first sucker who does.  Good players turn a massive amount of long and medium range engagements into short range fights because building affords them the opportunity to hide their tactical mistakes so easily.

That didn't happen in the early seasons.  The early seasons had balance.

Epic, please make Fortnite great again.  Find a way to bring back mid and long range fights because right now, Fortnite is severely lacking in terms of variety.

2 Days ago Tfue disrespect Symfuhy on live stream pretty hard and pretty ignorant and I have to ask why this man is still associated with Epic . Tfue has clearly a tilt rage tunnel that he often gets from being overwhelmed as a SELLOUT and it started from early season with TSM\_Myth and that PURE outplay he did on Tfue and almost ""THE PLAY"" he did to shat on Tfue's Pro career.... So the question is ... why can Tfue talk so much crap about any fortnite streamer.. make them ""lose"" in any way (may it be career, a light view or just out of sheer stupidity like this) and then him being the ""Better"" person in the picture.... Like serious?

&amp;#x200B;

Here is some interesting facts about showering since the fortnite monitors have clearly fried Tfue brain with respect... integrity... and being humble that people are just human. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T SHOWER EVERYDAY. Read up on it... If anything what Symfuhy does it technically great and above because he's right... but in the end who cares when a top sellout stream mock's him... makes him lose valuable subs in order some profit gain in Tfue's future... may it a future donation from someone who unsub Symfuhy or another subber who felt ashamed hear this long loyal ""family community"" was ""dirty"" and then swaps off to another fortnite streamer who has ""such a high morale"" like Tfue or maybe Tfue LMAO?...... Pure crap.

&amp;#x200B;

Can Epic start sponsoring some real fortnite pro's? Not wannabe's streamers who cry about stream snipe LIVE ON STREAM... lie, cry and complain while not even checking the highlight b4 if it was really ""STREAM SNIPED"" .... WHO CARES DUDE! YOUR LIVE! AINT ROCKET SCIENCE TO A 12 YEAR OLD....... #Disrespect

Most guns have a counter which is placing a wall in front of you but the RPG doesn't have that counter and the range damage makes it easier to fight against and requires less skill to use.  


My suggestion is to nerf the damage of the RPG and/or grenades towards players to around 30-50, but keep or maybe increase the damage towards structures, decrease the range of damage towards players. Thank you :)",FortNiteBR

I remember when they took double pump out because they wanted variety in their game and everyone was using it but like now, how is there supposed to be variety if they continue to take guns out for literally no reason. 

Fortnite is forcing a meta when they didn’t want it. Add more guns or bring vaulted guns back. The best seasons were S3-5 with tommy guns, tac subs, etc.

in my opinion, it is. season 3 wasn't much different from season 2 roughly. it was also the second battle pass in the game and introduced weekly challenges something we didn't have in season 2. the map was pretty similar to season 2 map with the addition of luck landing the expansion of moisty. people may argue that the population increased by a lot. After season 2 ended another 3.2 million players joined and this is not much different comparing it to season 4 season so and roughly 19.8 million players in total joined in season 4 &amp; season 5, which is a much bigger spike in population (myth busted). also, season 3 is getting ready to be a year old and you guys would be surprised how many people don't have john wick or even elite agent btw

![img](blkobl126ed21)

When playing Season 1, I remember that finding a purple or gold item was actually rare.  I think we need to revert to this meta, while making Epic/Legendary items more prevalent mid/late games. 

**How**?

\- Instead of being independent of time, each chest draw would depend on the stage of the game. Common/Uncommon/Rare varieties would be likely early game, while Epic/Legendary draws would be more likely late game. The function could depend continuously on time, or depend discretely on circle stages. 

\- Floor loot would be skewed towards Common/Uncommon/Epic variants. Supply drops stay as is. 

**Why**? 

Major points:

\- It makes early game fights less dependent on ""who finds the bigger gun"". 

\- It makes looting mid/end game more valuable, decreasing camping. 

Minor points:

\- It would give a ""purpose"" to pistols &amp; other low-grade weaponry: they are what you fight with early game. Enriching this category would make sense. 

\- Worse weapons in early flights would accommodate the fact that people have little shield/mats at this stage. 

&amp;#x200B;

*PS: the graphic above is just one example. I'd make it every more skewed -- making epic/legendary variant virtually impossible to find early game. Making deterministic functions of circles (the distribution jumps) might make it easier for players to understand the concept. Some fine-tuning for specific items is probably necessary -- the starting point, end point, and transition function should be item-specific, not color-specific.*

If you knock somebody, go ahead and finish them! 

I don’t think people understand what we mean when we say thirsting is toxic. Let me paint a scenario for you. 

Say me and my teammate are in the house by lazy links. We’re running next to each other like brothers in arms when all of the sudden, we both encounter the same person. My buddy gets knocked and even though I’m right there shooting at the person who knocked him, he ignores me, proceeds to take a shit ton of damage, and eliminates my teammate, only to die by my hand right after. 

Now what would be the point in that? You’re being shot at by somebody yet you’re using your tunnel vision and neglecting their teammate just so you could get your first ever kill. Now *that’s* toxic and shouldn’t be applauded. 

You want to thirst somebody that you just knocked? Go for it. You want to thirst somebody instead of defending yourself? Now that’s redundant and toxic. I get it, you want your kills but fact is, you could double, triple, or quadruple your kills if you focused on your immediate threat instead of a downed person who literally can’t do anything. 

TL;DR: go ahead and thirst people, that’s not a problem. Just don’t be so narrow minded that you start itching for one measly kill instead of looking at the big picture considering you will die if you’re shooting at a downed person when their teammate is there. It’s not about what you do but how you do it. This is a form of thirsting that EVERYBODY should be against.

As a console player it’s quite annoying when a pc pro/streamer gets salty when they get killed by a controller player and call it auto aim, aimbot etc.
Aim assist isn’t even remotely OP because you need to be aiming at him already! It doesn’t just lock on when you’re looking at the centre of the screen and he’s on the far right. You need to be looking at the person you want to shoot and it will bring you closer to the target but it’s not a guaranteed hit.
“Oh look at that its tracking him how is this not op?!?!” Yeah there’s moments when aim assist kinda tracks someone in close range fights but do you want to know how you do it? It only works  if you sit completely still putting yourself at a disadvantage by sitting in the open shooting a high fire rate gun, dont even try doing it with an AR it won’t work.
I saw a tweet the other day from some pro player cant remember who saying “I’m plugging in a controller late game aim assist is so op” people dont seem to understand that on controller you move like a bot, building and editing especially is so much harder. Every single time I’ve seen pc players go “you know what chat I’ll show you how overpowered this is” they get some kills on bad streamsnipers and scream I TOLD YOU ITS OP but then the second they get into a real fight they get fucking shit on and go yeah it’s not that good.

I’d love to see one of these pros be at a real event, 60+ people in later circles and just plug in a controller they’ll never talk shit about it again.

Sorry for this rant but I haven’t been playing this game since it came out, I only started midway in season 5 so when a pc player says controller auto aim is op anyone can do it it’s really insulting to us controller players and normally I don care about it but now I just had to let off some steam.

Well, fate was not on my side... once I got home I turned on my console to complete my challenges and guess what? Epic was having login issues... so I waited nearly three hours to play. Then, I see that Epic has finally fixed the problem and hop on to Fortnite mobile to finish them. I had nearly half of my challenges done and I began playing to get the easy ones out of the way. Well, it seems like it was scrims night on mobile because I’d get shot every single game and not really be able to do my challenges as quickly as I’d like. So, after four hours of doing my challenges, I have all of mine done except for the elite zombie one, only needing ten kills, so I hop onto a game with almost ten minutes before the deadline. I get many kills for the zombies and I only need a few left, with me trying to play as pacifist as possible. So, I get near a zombie spawner to get my finals kills when I get sniped and game over for me.

I’ve finally gotten my most sought after emote. Pumpernickel. Now, let me tell you a story. On the terrible times I’ve had with this emote.

The Pumpernickel emote first debuted in the item shot on August 7th, 2018. Ceeday uploaded a video that day, featuring the emote in his transitions. At one point in the video, I slowed it down, just to see this goofy emote he was using. I saw it. Pumpernickel. I had enough to buy it. But sadly, I was away on a week trip, and my mom and I stayed later, in another city instead of going back that day.

We get home, and the Hippie skins (which I was also waiting for) debut, and since they were still out, I purchased Far Out Man and his entire set. Pumpernickel has left the item shop by this point. 

Fast forwarding, every single time the emote released, I had spent V-Bucks a day or two before. An example of this is buying myself Electro Shuffle, and Pumpernickel releasing two days after. It was a curse. And every time it released, my friend who had the emote, would ask if ‘I got it.’. I always had to say no. For the 7 or so times it released. 

Last weekend, the emote released, and like the curse says, I am not able to buy Pumpernickel. I knew it wouldn’t come out for some time after that, and I said I’d just wait again.

Today, for some unexplained reason, Pumpernickel releases. I thought to myself ‘Just another day where I don’t get the emote’. But as I look at my V-Buck balance, I notice that I’m at 320, and I also remember I have Save the World challenges. I do the math, and only come out with 470. 

I was very disappointed that I wouldn’t be able to get the emote again, and gave up. 

But then, I remember. Toxic Treasures. A challenge in Save the World that requires the player to hunt down and kill mimics. A quest that gives exactly 30 V-Bucks. The stars had aligned. Would today finally be the day I break the curse?

I log into the other mode, and see my Dailies. 
•Mission Specialist - Constructor
•Daily Scout - Industrial Construction Zones
•Daily Destroy - Teddy Bears

The last one scared me. I had never been able to complete that quest. But if I wanted to break the curse, I had to try.

I load into a suburban zone, and find two teddies. I was excited. I finish the mission, and decide I’ll go to industrial zones to complete that challenge.

As I’m looking through the zone for construction sites, I find.. a teddy? And once I find the two in the zone, I find another teddy! I finish the mission, and another, finding two teddies.

I load into the final mission, I look around for teddies, no luck. I enter a modern house, and assume there won’t be any teddies, but I might as well check. What do you know.. the final teddy. I break it. 

I’ve finally done it. As I remember I have to complete the mission, I go completely FRiCko MoDe on the encampments. 

I collect my rewards, and go to the item shop. Finally. I press the ‘X’ button on my controller. Pumpernickel was mine. The curse is broken.

Thank you for reading my wall of text.

When you are just minding your own business and going into the circle and someone snipes you in the head you cant even do anything,at least give me a chance to fight back..i mean sure you have to reward that person for hitting a headshot but rewarding so much that i cant even do anything about it is just stupid.

And then there's pump shotgun..we asked to buff pumps because they were hitting for like 9,11 etc and epic decide increase damage of pumps and add new variants of pumps..now green pump can one shot you.

In my opinion any weapon that can shot you should not be in the game because this is not how you want to play a game, i think weapon damage needs a rework..may be not too much but so much so that everyone has a small chance to recover even if they are hit or headshot.

I have no problem with people not being good, there's always room for change, but the lesser skilled players who couldn't adapt to the meta's earlier in the game's life completely ruined it! Let's take double pump for instance. In my opinion, double pump was a solid meta, in order to use it, you had to have a good reaction time, be quick with your hands, have good hand eye coordination, aiming, etc. But, the lesser skilled players who couldn't adapt to this meta began complaining to Epic about how unfair it was, and eventually they got it out of the game. The more skilled players who adapted to the meta, practiced with it, and perfected it completely got screwed just because Epic wanted to cater to the people less skilled. Then, building became the meta. It was (and still is) a great meta! But, like most meta's, players who couldn't adapt complained to epic, and they added EXTREME counter-measures to building, such as quad launchers, compact SMGs, boom boxes, etc. Then (adding on to the shotgun argument) people who were not skilled with the pump shotgun began to complain that headshots were too powerful. I agree that 300 damage is too powerful, but the game had a TINY bit of realism with it, a headshot in real life would most likely be fatal, I think that Epic should make shotguns more powerful close range than any gun, because that's what a shotgun is. Also, people who couldn't use shotguns properly made Epic add in the spray and pray meta, where you literally don't even aim to melt someone to oblivion. And keep in mind, I know that Epic is trying their best to cater to everyone, and balance the game, but I feel like there should be an easier way to voice your opinion. (THIS IS NOT A BASH ON ANYONE, JUST A DISCUSSION!)",FortNiteBR

Let me explain, this mode should contain the following:

\- Season 3 (or 2) map (or something similar).

\- Only guns/weapons from Season 3 (or 2), even if they are currently vaulted.

\- The weapon glares, when the guns are on the floor, will be like the older versions.

\- When building, the colors will be the same (don't make it that you can't build due to a rock/tree).

\- When editing out something, it will be clear until you escape from edit mode (like old versions).

\- Double pump/two shotguns without a delay.

\- 30 materials from the floor/chests. 

\- 500 material llamas.

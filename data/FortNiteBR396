I wanted to buy the battlepass first but now that STW is 50% off i can't decide. I heard you can get v-buck in STW, how much can you get per day/week ? Should i go with STW and buy battlepass with earned vbucks ?

Also not sure about STW since it will be free this year...

Edit: Thanks for your answer all ! Going with STW because i cant get Vbuck here and it will be nive when i will be tired of BR, and that's a new game !

Because of my very average computer, lag has always been a slight problem, mostly in the form of very subtle stuttering. But for the past week it has become a lot worse, with total freezes of up to 10 seconds, where only audio continues, occurring occasionally in matches (costing me several wins so far). Theses freezes occur despite no fps drop and and and my internet testing far above the required speed and consistency. 
Now that this new patch has dropped the long freezes are occurring every minute and my computer's toolbar keeps popping up and disabling in game movement (until I alt-tab) despite not even having a windows key, making it totally impossible to play competitively. 

So long story short, don't be stupid like me, test the game before committing to the buy.

Now I’ve been playing with a keyboard and mouse daily for two months and my building has improved significantly but I’m 100% sure that controller me would beat keyboard me 100% of the time.

With this enabled, someone can have 999 of every material (2997 total) and literally just hold left mouse button and wave left to right in order to potentially alter the outcome of the fight with little to no effort / skill.
Skill-gap is something that people enjoy in BR games, it is what makes them fun to play and competitive. Now, pre-update, people like Myth, Ninja, and Cloakzy (just a few mainstream examples off the top of my head, not limited  to them) were renowned for their insanely fast building and ability to out build others. Now, with the update, someone who previously wasn't on the same skill-level as those that I mentioned can compete at a far higher level than they should BECAUSE of turbo-building alone. 
Please Epic, don't make this update become something that gives the game a bad reputation. The update to put ramps thru trees, etc was necessary. But this? It really wasn't needed. People need the skill gap that was previously there for the game to continue to be uniquely competitive.
I don't expect you to do anything off of my post alone, but if enough people agree that they're against it, would you do something? Y'all at Epic HQ haven't failed us yet by listening to the community.

I'm on tier 69 with my daily challenges sitting there, and according to epics timer last night, I still had atleast 3-4 hours this morning to get it done before the season ended. 

Why add a timer for us if it's wrong?

Do something Epic, you fucked me. I want my black knight or the 900 v bucks I spent trying to boost to it.

Next thing someone's shooting at me so I fly away to the corner store, grab a white SMG and manage to get a pump as I dodge gunshots to the news paper stand, come under the basketball court to first victim - pump shotty to the face, switch to SMG to finish, 'fresh dance' as I see 3 impulse grenades fall to the ground, proceed to loot and impulse my way into the building next to me to ramp inside - once I get inside I get pump shotty'd to the face.

The first version of the boogie bomb would make an enemt dance for 10 seconds. The enemy couldn't do anything besides walking/crouching/jumping. Nothin would cancel the animation, it would only stop after 10 seconds. Now of course this is incredibly op, when you get hit out in the open there's nothing you can do. 

That's why they made boogie bomb 2.0. It was pretty much the same, but this time, the timer would be 5 seconds instead of 10. This was a great change, but Epic still thought that 2.0 was too op. So that's when Epic decided to pretty much delete boogie bomb from every loadout. 

Right now, the boogie effect lasts for 5 seconds, but is stopped once the dancer gets shot. This change meant that the boogie bomb was left behind, it's only used early game now. I think that it's sad how Epic has just abandoned these items. Right now the best place for boogie bomb (and smoke grenade) is the vault.

But there's a way to change the boogie bomb! Everyone hates that the boogie effect stops after a hit. We should just keep the 5 second timer, and boogied players could still shoot, but their accuracy would be all over the place. Maybe have the crosshair move around in the screen, so you can know when you are actually aiming at someone. This will make the boogie a lot more useful, because right now I don't see a use for it",FortNiteBR

The gold sniper is not any more special than the blue. Here's why:

**Current Damage outputs for sniper variations:**

Blue: 105 body, 200+ head  
Purple: 110 body, 200+ head  
Gold: 116 body, 200+ head

As you can see, all snipers are insta-kill to the head, and only 11 damage sets the lowest and highest tier snipers apart.

Only in the rare case that someone has between 106-116 health will a gold sniper actually benefit you over a blue. Seriously, why would someone be at this awkward value of overall health?

That being said, there are very subtle recoil, and reload speed differences between the two snipers. But nothing tangible enough that a normal player would notice without being disclosed that information.

Let's make some changes that actually make sense given the recent updates. The prevalence of minis in the game has resulted in a lot of people being at 50 shields for gunfights, which is awesome for the pace of the game.

Here is my proposal:

**Proposed damage outputs for sniper variations:**

Blue: 101 body, 200+ head  
Purple: 126 body, 200+ head  
Gold: 151 body, 200+ head

75, 100, 125, 150, and 200 are the most common health points in the game.

Let's cater the sniper to that fact-   
A blue sniper can still one shot body someone with 100 health (without shields, or with shields, low health).    
A purple can one shot body someone with 125 health (common mid-game 75 health, 50 shields).   
A gold can one shot body someone with 150 health (100 + one big shield, other variations).

This would actually add value to different the different tiers, and actually make you salivate from seeing a purple or gold sniper laying on the ground!

When you assassinate a guy, you get a random reward item dropped with his loot.

I think it would be pretty funny in conjunction with bushes, and would promote more aggressive gameplay.

Also EPIC could make assassinations customisable, just like in the Halo series.

What do you guys think?

Edit: Oh my god. 

Assassinations are incredibly difficult. ESPECIALLY in 3rd person. It’s so bad you could call it a troll mechanic. Yet half the comments are calling it overpowered......

I'm not talking about guys that I am right behind, as in shotgun range, but maybe more like 75-100 feet in front of me where I'd have to be dead accurate with my rifle shots if I want to get the kill before he can react.

I find myself trying to get as close as possible to him and waiting for an open area where he can't duck behind natural cover easily.  Then I'll crouch and start shooting and try to hit all my shots on him.  If I'm not accurate enough, he'll be able to build some walls real quick and then we start having a build battle, which I'm not the greatest at.  

So how do you guys approach these situations?  Try to sneak up on them and take them out with a shotty?  Build a ramp behind them and start unloading with a rifle?  What works for you?

----

**Description:**  
*Glider stored in same slot as traps, jump pad, campfire.*

When selected, a see-through glider will appear in front of your character.  If you see this, that means you are ready to activate.  

User may jump off of elevated locations and pull the trigger, once activated, the disposable one-time-use glider will allow the user to move through the air just like they do when they are initially dropping.  This allows them to make a quick escape off of a mountain, to beat the oncoming storm by climbing high and jumping, and to quickly save themselves should they find themselves being shot out of the sky.   

----

***I am aware of the similarities this shares with the jump pad, however, there are many differences as well.  Jump pad can be shared with multiple people, jump pad cant be activated as you are falling, and the jump pad gives the user a boost into the sky where as the disposable glider does not.*** ",FortNiteBR

A question you may be asking yourself if you’ve read our [Battle Pass Season 3 Breakdown](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/welcome-to-season-3-battle-pass-breakdown):  
&amp;nbsp;  
What is a Back Bling? Or, what are Back Blings?  
&amp;nbsp;  
It’s a brand new cosmetic slot in your locker that lets you customize the back torso of any outfit.   You can acquire Back Bling from the store or Battle Pass to permanently own and turn on and off as you wish!  
&amp;nbsp;  
*Wait, the Raptor outfit already includes a backpack. Can I swap his backpack for a new Back Bling item? Is the Raptor backpack now a Back Bling item I can wear on other outfits?*  
&amp;nbsp;  
Yes! Raptor's backpack now becomes equippable Back Bling in your locker in 3.0. You can choose to use his default as your Back Bling or use any of the other Back Blings that you may acquire from the Battle Pass or the Store.   
  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Other FAQ**  
&amp;nbsp;    
*Do I have to wear Back Bling?*  

No, you can leave it unequipped in your locker.  
&amp;nbsp;  
*If I have Back Bling equipped, does it allow me to carry more inventory?*

No, Back Bling is purely cosmetic.  
&amp;nbsp;  
*Do the wings come off of the Love Ranger?*

Yes.  
&amp;nbsp;

Yup!  
&amp;nbsp;

After 2.5.0 the weapon outlines were scrapped, and replaced with a foggy-looking grid around each weapon. Whether it was intended to happen or not, weapon outlines need to be added back. A lot of people on this subreddit have complained about this, and I thought it was no big deal. But after a week-long hard grind to finish the Season 2 Battle Pass I am starting to agree about how big of issue this is.

It is very hard to distinguish what loot I’m looking at from far away. I would say you have be within 10 meters to tell exactly what loot is dropped, and it isn’t a vision problem because I have 20/20 vision. I can’t imagine not being able to see as clearly as I can would be like. What’s my point? For people with and without great vision, the new loot visuals are terrible and hard to see.

I recommend an easy solution: go back to the old version before the 2.5.0 patch. The loot was incredibly easy to spot because of the distinct outline around the weapon. I don’t think it would be a very hard thing to add back and I don’t think it will slow down the game very much. What’s the worst that could happen, maybe losing 1 FPS at the end when dead loot litters the floor? It seems like a good deal to me and I’m guessing most people would agree.

The game is doing great, and I’m glad the devs are constantly giving us updates and taking feedback from us. I believe this was an unnecessary change, or maybe an unintentional one that needs to be fixed. Regardless, the change makes it hard to see weapons far away, and where I don’t think the intention was to make it hard for me to tell if I’m looking at a Purple Scar or a Purple Pistol, the change should be reverted immediately.",FortNiteBR

3)The silent guy, the wise. This guy is maybe too poor to afford a mic (probably just too lazy to plug it) but his heart is rich. He will get your attention and drop you shields/weapons. He will risk his life to try to revive a downed mate.
4)The ""away from keyboard"" guy.
He will set up ""ready"" as he leave to do something else. He will never drop, and the bus driver (tired of his bullshits) will kick his ass out the bus. When everyone is dead/about to die, he will be back.
5)The legend himself. You have never seen a gamer so skilled. He will have a mic, try to communicate and stick with the rest of the squad. He can take 4 vs 1 by himself without even sweating. As you wonder if this guy is playing on console with mouse and keyboard, he will absolutely destroy anyone and gift you a win.
6)The thief. This little burglar has no idea what teamwork means. If dropped in your same house, he will leave you with an empty inventory even if you ask for a piece of bread.
He will steal all the loot from the people you killed. If he somehow saves you as you are down, before reviving you, he will obviously go for the loot first, even if you killed 2 full squads, 3 Epic developers, a cheater and Exodia. 
7)The try hard guy. This little fella wants to have all the best guns 'cause he is a PRO MLG and can use them better than you can.
He will be anally raped by a double pump squad and complain that you left him alone to die, he was lagging, his house was on fire, his grandma died and his killers were probably all cheaters.
8)The resident sleeper. This is not a human, it's a rat. When all the squad has decided to drop in a certain place, he will drop in a lost corner of the map with only a small house haunted by the ghost of players who came 2nd. He will hide all the match, and when finally in the top 10, he will die under the first 1 vs 1 shooting.

Every weapon has it's ups and downs.

Minigun: constant fire, low damage.

Bolt action sniper: Really high damage, you have to reload after every shot, and you need to be accurate.

Now let's discuss the pump shotgun.
It does really high damage at close range however has a long period between shots.
So there you've got a strength and a weakness.
However by having 2 pump shotguns you would imagine that it would have a high damage but a lot longer time between shots.

However that's not what it did.
It did the opposite.
Very high damage and it negated the time between shots.
Making it unbalanced.

And even though some people try to argue that you need to be accurate.
You need to be accurate with all guns.

That's just my thoughts on the up coming changes.",FortNiteBR

I made a short weapon overview about a week ago and had quite a few people say that my information about sniper rifles was wrong. More specifically that rare sniper rifles have faster travel speed, less bullet drop, or just overall better handling. I did some testing and came to the following results:

Bolt Action Snipers:

Bullet speed and drop for Bolt Action Sniper Rifles are identical between rarities. Thus, all bolt action snipers have the exact same ballistics.

Video evidence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weQRotE-Tzs&amp;t=01m04s

Semi-Auto Snipers:

These guns are a little different. On first viewing my tests seemed to indicate a large different in bullet drops between purple and gold semi-autos. The bullets appears to be hitting targets at very different levels on the mil-dots. However, upon further inspection I noticed that this wasn't true. Instead the lower rarity semi-autos just kick a lot more thus giving the impression of worse bullet drop. So again, the ballistics are the same on these snipers. However, the gold semi-auto will be much easier to use due the lower recoil/shake.

Video evidence: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weQRotE-Tzs&amp;t=01m32s

Other fun facts:

Due the high base damage and 2.5x headshot multipliers, the shots to kill are the same for all snipers in each class. A gold bolt action isn't any better than a blue one when it comes to shots to kill. Same for the purple and gold semi-autos.

I hope this is helpful for you all.

I don't think the grenades are quite powerful enough where you'd ever leave behind a full slot for them, and thus it should be fine to have a dedicated slot for them if this is the case. Even watching streams I've seen people prefer the 3 weapon 2 heal slot usage, and they all seem to feel bad for leaving behind healing if they opt for a grenade over something else.

By adding this feature, we effectively close the skill gap just a little bit more. It decreases the amount of long range engagements because we now know that turbo building can prevent anyone from getting a kill. With a shooting model like bloom when you're not guaranteed to get a headshot with anything besides a crossbow and a sniper, those long range engagements become a bit more risky without those weapons. Basically we're seeing an indirect nerf to ARs. Will I still carry one? Absolutely.

I'm assuming there will be more shooting tests coming up, because in order for Fortnite to take a shot at an eSports market, they will have to do something to remedy the RNG bullet spray that got a bit more of a nerf due to turbo building. This is coming from someone who plays on both console and on PC.

They are CONSTANTLY adding new guns to what was already a solid mix of pistol/smg/rifle/sniper/explosives/meds.  

Do we need 3 variations of pistols? I feel like the only sensible addition that's been made since this whole charade began was the mini-gun because it adds a new dynamic (even though I hate using it).  

It's one thing to add a new gun like, every few months... maybe! But shittt, I don't know, I just feel like all these new additions have to be factoring into why the gameplay has been deteriorating.  They are trying to do too much and are ignoring performance issues (which is a major problem in my opinion). 

EPIC, we would much prefer the simple and smooth gameplay we had last month to all these erratic changes and laggy/buggy mechanics issues.  Please, get back to the basics and stop worrying about innovation for a minute.  We loved the game for what it was.

Just some ideas you could include for April Fools. Leave your own suggestions in the comments :)

---


- Make doors open backwards.


- Chests act like Ammo Crates and Ammo Crates act like Chests.


- Healing yourself heals a teammate instead of yourself (preharps a good Mode? Could make for some tactical plays).


- Spike Trap fires confetti and doesn't harm players (or maybe it does).


- Boogie Bombs effect the players effected but also the player who threw it.


- Applying the Bush consumable puts a giant arrow pointing down at the player.


- Any Healing or Armour consumable plays a custom song sung by the ""New Friend Request"" lady. (Or a Dev). This plays a prank on the players too give away they are weak.


- Custom Main Menu music. Club Penguin had an amazing April Fools song. [Here](https://youtu.be/N_KITcus5io)


- Hard but could be funny for a day: Players Feet has the headshot multiplyer and the Players Head does standard body/ leg damage.


- Players go into the match with random height. A bit RNG but midgets vs giants would be funny.


- Players Gliders don't auto deploy. *zMasi DIDN'T STICK THE LANDING.*


- Windows auto spawn into every wall created by the player. Bit of a mean one here.


- Map is flipped.


- Battle Bus is upside down.


- Pickaxe is replaced by a Grey SMG that can't damage players.


- Minimap is replaced by a troll one which still represents the map. Swap land with water and water with land or something?


- RPG has a low chance of exploding in your own face when you fire it.


- Swap Pump and Tactical shotgun sounds over.


- Players glide in upside down? Funny to see and doesn't change gameplay.


- Add White colour tier weapons that act the same but make a special sound when you fire and confetti comes out the gun. (Still fires bulletd as well).


- Make Grey Tier AR fire bubbles.


- Put baloons on some guns cus why tf not.


- Make some models rainbow coloured cus why tf not.


- Make PUBG main menu souding music and make it your own main menu music for a day.


- Sign a contract with Disney and release some Star Wars skins already! - Lightsaber Pickaxe - Bush Wookie - Mini Millennium Falcon glider - Prequal Memes etc.... My idea so give me the skins free plz


- RPG custom model and sound.


- Sometimes a med kit can put you down to 1HP instead of heal to 100.


- Flashing crosshair. (off-on-off-on-off-on...)",FortNiteBR

Seeing as how so many studios these days (World of Warcraft, cough) copy paste content whenever they can why doesn't Epic at least bring SOME content from StW over? Why aren't their melee weapons? Why no variety of character models? I feel like they could bring so much just by phasing over some content from it.

&amp;nbsp;

after patch 2.5 I still have 20 ms ping to the EU server when I select region in menu, but ingame it's actually 100 ms now, if you know anything at all about online gaming, then you know that going from 20 ms to 100 ms is gamebreaking if you want to be competitive :/ and it's a lot higher/worse for others,


&amp;nbsp;

(i'm in Malmö, Sweden 100/10mbit connection and playing on PC)

&amp;nbsp;

my ping to eu server: https://i.imgur.com/P9PNXrN.png

&amp;nbsp;

my ping after landing ingame: https://i.imgur.com/rJuNlv9.jpg

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know if this is only a regional problem or only affecting some users or whatever, but so far every single person in EU I have asked about this confirm they have same issue, much higher ping ingame than actual ping to the server after patch, they went from 35 ping to 120 etc etc..

&amp;nbsp;

Would be interesting if other EU players (or anyone that wants to contribute feedback) could reply with these 2 things:

&amp;nbsp;

1. your ping to your regional server
2. your ping ingame AFTER landing 
3. your location and if on PC/console


&amp;nbsp;

If you don't know how to enable net stats, you have to start a match (menu is invisible if not in a match) and go to options - game - hud - net stats (it's the last option on bottom) and enable it, 

&amp;nbsp;

it shows your true ping when playing, this should be the same as in the menu where you select region, and if it is not then you also have this problem :/

&amp;nbsp;

Would be very much appreciated anyway if anyone takes time and checks this, trying to get low smooth ping again, thanks!

1. Could this make the game better?
2. Would other players use this, or is this just something that would help me out?

This is my first post here. So I'm sorry if that topic was created somewhere already. I started playing fortnite late January. The genre is pretty familiar to me as I've spent hundreds of hours playing h1z1 or pubg. Absolutely in love with the game. What bothers me is the fact that even though I have about 50 wins in 70h of gameplay. Bought the battle pass immediately but I could only make it to tier 40~ doing every single daily challenge and getting to level 70. Buying it just felt bad knowing I won't make it to the late tiers. I know that you can just buy it, but thats like buying stuff you already bought. I know the system changed on 3rd battle pass and newcomers now get all the previous battle pass challenges. Would it not be a good idea if we could somehow still unlock previous battlepasses? Like for example make our stars go to BP 2 instead of going to BP 3. 

I'm not sure you get more stars now than it is neccessary to unlock all of the skins (for example streamers weren't even doing challenges in January as they had full BP unlocked), but I think it would not hurt anyone if latecomers could still somehow grind for the previous Battle passes even if it required alot of time. That would be fun for latecomers and still make profit for Epic.

Looking forward to any feedback from you guys.",FortNiteBR

I, among many other players, made the switch to combat pro and devoted a lot of time and effort to not only get familiar with the controls but to also learn the skill of double pumping. I can't stress the ""skill"" aspect enough. It's not some exploit that only certain people can do, but, rather, a skill that can be developed by anyone that puts the appropriate time/effort. This adds such a nice skill gap to the game and rewards the players who put the time into perfecting this unique style of play. There's always going to be complaints about certain weapons and their strengths, and, granted, some are warranted (for example, the excessive damage the Scar would do when you were able to land a headshot). Those are understandable patches that you guys made. However, this is not one of them. Double pumping isn't a guarantee win in every shotgun engagement. You can still easily lose to a player using a regular tac shotgun. You're not forced to use the double pump because of the fear of not being able to compete without it. In fact, with the removal of it, you are going to be forced to simply use a tac shotgun because the pump, by itself, shoots far too slow to consistently compete/win with. It's not like there isn't a drawback with using the double pump either. You need to use two slots in order to run a double pump, which forces you to make a tough decision on what you can carry in your inventory and what you're forced to leave behind as a result. The game, as a whole, is going play/feel much more bland with the removal. In its current state, players are given options; choose to go double pump, or go with a tac shotgun instead and be afforded the opportunity to carry an item that you were not allowed to carry while double pumping. This adds a level of strategy that I know a lot of players particularly enjoy. I understand that the double pump was not something that you guys were intending, but sometimes good things can happen from things that were not intended. I can list several games that each have their own unique skill/method of playing that was not at all intended by the developers, but that ended up working perfectly and made the game stand out even more. Double pumping is that for you guys. There have been countless great/clutch moments that have been made by using the double pump (moments that cannot be emulated by any other weapon) and it would be such a shame to not be allowed to continue to make these great moments. In my opinion, if you were guys to cast a poll (which I would love for you guys to do), I'm confident that there would be more votes voting against the removal than those in favor of it. It would also not seem fair to those who have devoted time and effort to perfecting the double pump to realize that it was for ultimately nothing. Again, the double pump is not some game-breaking style of play that cannot be stopped. Rather, it's a unique skill that, if you work hard enough, can enhance your gameplay and create several opportunities for you. As I mentioned, I cannot speak for PC players as the gameplay is completely different on there, but please, please reconsider the removal on console. It has practically become the norm on console and, so, I don't see it as a necessary removal. If you read this far, thank you. I absolutely love the game and the hard work you guys have put in, but this removal will ruin a unique aspect of the game.",FortNiteBR

But after that about 55hrs I got bored because back then there was nothing to achieve, no leaderboards, statistics or even skins.

However after buggy pubg, poe and diablo 2 I went back to fortnitebr just to see what an amazing game has come true. Stats, leaderboards, skin, an ultra fair battlepass. I fucking love that game now (besides the double pump abuse, but that's another topic).

However while I was concentrated on winning back then I found myself to enjoy the game much more taking everything how it comes. I'm winning? Fine! I lost? Alright, I got hell o fun.

I mean, I'm just jumping around, trying different spots, trolling others in solo and eventually I'll even kill them just to have the laugh of the day.

I really enjoy coming from work, booting fortnite and just have some serious fun. No matter how good I am in different matches.

But that's not all, besides just having fun this subreddit has become life for me. I like how positive, constructive and funny everyone is. Nobody (almost) is crying flaming or blaming.

If you were also wondering this, check out my math and see how I did.

Total stars required to max out the battle pass = 1,000 stars


Weekly challenges:
9 weeks x 50 stars each = 450 stars


Daily challenges: (68 days in season 3) 
68 days x 5 stars each = 340 stars


XP leveling (calculated based on reaching level 94):

Levels 5,15,25,35,45,55,65,75,85 x 5 stars = 45 stars

Levels 10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90 x 10 stars = 90 stars

Other levels: 75 levels x 1 star = 75 stars

45 + 90 + 75 = 210 stars



450 + 210 + 340 = 1,000 stars



Based on these figures, level ~~94~~ 90 will be required to max out the battle pass without buying tiers.

Please let me know if I made any mistakes! 

Edit: u/Itshaft15 was keen to inform me that 990 stars are required, not 1,000. This would reduce the amount of levels required down to level 90. 

TL;DR: My math shows that if you did every weekly challenge as well as every single daily challenge during season 3, you would still need to reach level ~~94~~ 90 (on XP) if you wanted to max out the battle pass without buying any tiers with V-bucks. ",FortNiteBR

My point is, the loot pool is now diluted so much that the current amount of inventory slots feels very limiting in regards of the vast amount of items. At the very least, healing items and grenades should have their seperate inventory slots. A lot of loot now just gets left behind due to a lack of space.


The inventory system failed to evolve with increasing loot pools. Start by pooling different types of loot (healing, shielding and grenades) together. For example, it used to be much simpler to get regular shield potions but it is diluted by miscellaneous items. It is an equation on how to get full shielding while not gimping your combat strength.

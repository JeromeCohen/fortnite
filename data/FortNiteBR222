Before I start explaining, [here](https://imgur.com/a/UOukiYp) are my stats for those who think I'm trolling.

I've been playing Fortnite on the PC for **over 8 months** now, since the end of December (towards the end of season 2, IIRC), having racked up a total of **over 2600 games** in all modes with **literally 0 wins in any category** until fairly recently, when I was carried into a couple duo and squad wins by friends (I lucked out with a few kills in each of these games but nothing major, with many of those kills 'stolen' from teammates). My KD is literally 0.28, with marginal improvement over the seasons –– numbers you'd only expect from someone completely new to the game. I've had a bit of experience with shooters in the past, playing CoD and Overwatch casually.

What frustrates me most is the fact that I have tried every strategy I've seen, from playing it safe and camping to landing aggressively and trying to enter gunfights whenever feasible (the bulk of my strategy ATM). I've entered a Catch 22 of sorts; when I say I choke after camping, people tell me to learn how to fight and play aggressively without focusing on wins. When I tell them I rarely ever win fights and only ever get kills by lucking out or wasting resources and time, they tell me to play it safer. 

Regardless, none of these strategies have done anything for me. When the in-game RNG lines up perfectly for me, I choke, thanks to my horrible aim and total lack of hand-eye coordination, a lack of game sense, or sheer anxiety. When I have a decent killstreak (and for me that's quite literally anything over 1 kill) going, the RNG destroys my game. You'd think 2600 games would be enough for the Law of Large Numbers to start kicking in.

Personally, I'd say my biggest flaw is my inability to aim. I rarely ever hit shots, with abysmal accuracy in most fights, and typically just end up dying to the first person I see. I have suboptimal game sense and strategy but frankly I've had plenty of games where others are helping me strategize and nothing good comes of it, because I can't fight properly.

I can comfortably say that building isn't my fatal flaw, nor is my hardware. I have a gaming computer that can comfortably run the game at over 130 FPS with high settings, excepting the occasional lag spikes caused by stress on Epic servers. I can build and edit on par with most of my friends who comfortably win on a regular basis, and my hardware is basically a non-issue.

What's even more disheartening is seeing friends who've invested a fraction of the time I have into this game comfortably winning on a regular basis, or at least winning gunfights with ease; many I've played with dominate even **playing on console against PC players**, while I'm downed or dead after a fight I should have won without issue.

I really just don't get it at this point, and I'm wondering if anyone has any tips or suggestions. This game still isn't a major part of my life, but it is a bit of a letdown to see no improvement after working on it for some time.

Thanks in advance.

23,DJ_221,1536116324,9d2esf,13,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9d2esf/options_while_knocked/,0,Options While Knocked,"You're in a team fight in duos or squads, your team is pushing forward and you get knocked by an enemy but instead of continuing to fight, that enemy runs up to you (the downed player who poses no threat) and full kills you for no reason. Now that sucks, and it sucks even more when your team ends up winning the fight and now they have to go on without a team member. Sometimes it's your fault for pushing forward and straying too far from your team but there are many times where it happens because they get a lucky head shot and are dead focused on killing you before they die which is no fun. So here are a few ways we could maybe change that.

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 1: Take out the ability to full kill someone**

This is my least favorite option because it is a part of the game and should remain it's just really infuriating sometimes so removing it wouldn't fix the problem it would be ignoring it

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 2: Give knocked players the ability to shoot**

I'm not saying shoot any gun or even reload it, I'd suggest allowing a knocked player to use a Pistol (Gray, Green, or Blue original pistol type) while knocked if they have one in their loadout. They would only be allowed to use what's in the clip and can't reload but it at least gives some fair reason to full kill a knocked enemy. It would also give people more reason to carry a pistol at least at beginning stages of the match since right now people don't use the original pistol much if at all

&amp;#x200B;

**Option 3: Can't damage knocked players if their teammates are nearby**

So I personally like this option best, if you get knocked an enemy cannot deal any damage to you while your teammate is within a certain range of you. This promotes continuing to fight and the winners of that fight will not suffer any losses of teammates but this still punishes players who push too far forward and without their team. I think this balances so that if you're playing with your team you'll be rewarded for your better skills rather than getting killed by a salty opponent

&amp;#x200B;

So of these three options which do you like best, or do you have a better idea to either promote not killing knocked players right away or giving consequences if they don't so there's at least reason behind it?",FortNiteBR

Perfect example to me is the new Female raven skin. I would absolutely love to have the wings, but i do not like the skin, and ive never been one to buy a skin i don't actually like. I think that if they did this, it would end up meaning more sales of backblings to make up for the lose in sales when it comes to the skin. They could also make it where if you buy the skin you get the backbling for 2000 v bucks (just an example) if you want just the backbling it will be 500 vbucks regardless of rarity, and if later you decide you do actually want the skin, it would stay at its normal value, so they could actually end up making more money off of a skin.

Now it's just full of sweaty players"" or ""I build battled this sweaty player earlier.  Such a try-hard LOL"".  A player that build battles or kills you isn't ""sweaty"", he/she is just a good player.  Get off your high horse, you're not as good as you think.

It really sucks when you trust the fill person to at least be in the match with you and they leave either when waiting for the bus or just seconds after the bus gets going. I understand its a casual game for a casual audience, but it still ruins the fun for the person who was left, as 1v2 or 2v4 games are much harder to win.

 I also understand that people have things that come up and they need to go, or an iffy internet connection, so the occasional disconnect WILL happen. But I'm talking about repeat leavers that leave within 1 minute of the match. Pretty much all other competitive games have some sort of functionality like this and it does help people stay when there is some kind of penalty for early leaving.

Lastly, the common retort is ""just play with trusted friends etc. etc."". Yes, in a perfect world we can all have our friends online when we are. But that's not always the case for me. And it shouldn't be a battle to get a teammate who will at least play. Also yes, I can just immediately leave an rejoin a new game, but thats mildly infuriating, especially when it happens in consecutive games.

204,NG_shotty,1536077257,9cx0xb,12,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/9cx0xb/long_post_discussion_about_the_balance_of_the/,0,LONG POST | Discussion about the balance of the game and possible solutions!,"A few minutes ago I saw a post claiming that if Epic were to remove the drum gun, most balance issues would be solved. This got me thinking, and I disagree to the point that I'd rather start a new thread so that we as a community can discuss the current meta civilly (please), where we can share some ideas on how balance could be addressed. Please do not take any of what I say personally, this is just my opinion and as I'm sure that some may agree, just as many may disagree. 

While I won't deny that the drum gun is currently overpowered, myself and many others love using it. It's just a fun weapon to use. I do think, however, that it could use a decent nerf, as well as further nerfing the p90.

Other alterations that would help with balance could be to slightly increase fire rate of the pump, slightly lower the fire rate of the heavy shotgun, drastically decrease ammo capacity of both grenade launcher and rocket launcher, and slightly lower the reload times for both bolt and heavy snipers.

A blanket nerf in damage for ALL weapons (except for pistols but not including the hand cannon) would be great. Currently weapons do so much damage that *most* situations lead to one party's death before any kind of strategy with building or positioning can be used, which further encourages spray and pray. The kind of spammy damage output that is the current meta is NEVER a good idea for games such as Fortnite that use number values as a health mechanic (looking at you, dead-after-two-weeks Island of Nyne), **especially** ones that do not have auto health regen. How are players expected to effectively heal up when being spammed with rockets and/or an SMG?

Currently, the game just feels like a farming simulator. I get it, Epic wants their newer players to have a chance too, and keep the playerbase even by preventing the experienced players from constantly and consistently outbuilding them. But currently the farm rate is so slow that newer or inexperienced players have a play rotation of drop -&gt; begin farming -&gt; get ganked while farming -&gt; requeue and do it again. The spam meta doesn't help them in most situations either, as they are either killed before they can react or their poor little structures are annihilated immediately. I know that experienced players and streamers especially like to complain about the spam meta and say that the game takes no skill, but that's not at all true. Think about it from a new player's perspective. An easy solution that could work would be to greatly increase the amount of materials gained from farming, but reduce the total material count from 3000 to maybe 1500. That way people aren't building huge structures and camping as was the case before, but they're not spending so much time each match just swinging their pickaxe before their unfortunate deaths. Or even allow a % of materials to be farmed from enemy structures when using a pickaxe.

Lastly, but certainly not least IMO, **non explosive weapons should not do so much damage to structures**! Building is what made fortnite! Building is the fun strategy of PvP combat that no other game has done as effectively as this one. There's a reason that there are multiple kinds of explosives in the game, and there's no reason I should be able to pistol whip a wall almost as fast as hitting it with an explosive. I feel that non explosive weapons should do far less damage to structures. That way, strategy could be reintroduced into the game and this atrocious spam meta could be done with.

Anyway that's just my two cents, hopefully I can spur up a little conversation and see how everyone else feels.",FortNiteBR

Of course you have tons of pistols everywhere you look but it does feel good to have a scar and heavy/double barrel every game. Secondly the only smg available is the p90 and I’ve only seen that once in a supply drop. Overall this LTM is a lot more fair to me than any others.

Let's say there are 4 challenges:

-get 3 sniper kills within a few seconds of time
This challenge is basically picking the 'jewelry' off with his defenders.

-win a match without shooting a gun (be the carrier)
This will lead you to rely on your teammates, strategic planning and using the cover you're given.

-kill the Carrier with an explosive

-enter the bus with the jewelry while taking signifcant damage, so basicslly you have 150 hp the second you enter the bus someone shoots you ending you at 23.

The lastchallenge could also be replaced by get X amount wins (adds up 10 wins per day the event is online)

This problem would be easily solvable (put a rug on the wall, move the desk/microphone,... ) yet someone with at this moment 300.000 viewers, who I guess also employs some staff, has not done it.

Why does he not improve his audio? Does he want his stream to feel grass-root/home-made and because of this does not improve his audio?

I, later, switched to siege and didn't get the issue?  I'm wondering if my controller is actually fucked or if it's something with the game. It would happen slightly and then if I didn't look down it'd get more dramatic and just shoot straight up.

I'm hoping it's my controller because it's a little gamebreaking to be aiming at someone, shooting and out of nowhere your crosshair is dragged up.

So i saw the Highlights of Ghost Ayden and everyone Hyping him as the BEST console player, hes a AWESOME Builder and has a really good game sense BUT, he abuses the Consoles Aim Assist Heavily on atleast 60% of his Kills.


You might ask HOW? Aiming in and Out really fast on Console makes the Aim Assist absolute OP and it litterally puts the crosshair new ON the enemy everytime you zoom out and in again quickly, saving a lot of fights in closerange when he swaps from Shotgun to Tommy / SMG.

I see my console friends using that Tactic with Pistols and it litterally makes the Aim Assist absolute OP in those situations..

[Here are a few of his kill highlights (bad quality, only i could find with the kills cut together)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rgyog46f8U)

So i personally see that as a Abuse or Bug, and due to Fast Peak and stuff being Patched that should be aswell, since it gives you an advantage over players without aim assist / not fast Aiming in and out",FortNiteBR

Its one of the only ways a bad player can kill a good player.,"I placed top 20 in solo showdown just to give you my credentials before I even give my reasons for this.

Sniping takes little skill to do, its nearly impossible to counter snipes, all you can do is jump around and walk in a zig zag, and even when doing that its still extremely possible to be killed by a snipe. Atleast when in a shotgun battle, the better builder will win 99.8 percent of the time. 

Snipers let potatoes kill decent players. As you guys know you can take as many sniper shots as you want without being in trouble if you miss your shots. 

It forces a passive unfun playstyle with just trying to snipe the other player then going back in hiding to shoot your next shot. 

I have a couple friends that play Fortnite and they're below average at the game, probably a .80 kd ratio, they pick up a sniper every time they see one and call themself the ''best sniper'' and to always hand them the sniper. This is because it lets worse players feel like absolute gods. 

Im calling it now ill get a bunch of people saying ''Sniping is the only skillful weapon in the game theres a bullet drop and you have to lead your shots.. bla bla bla bla bla.'' Okay, next time try to snipe your target with just one shot without taking a second one. 

I play solos a lot, I have a kd ratio of 7.60 I die to two reasons. I either get sniped or I die to fall damage. Half the time i get sniped its by some potatoe with 0 kills taking shots at me while I build battle or fight someone else.

Im waiting for the hate to poor in, it  just takes no skill to snipe, had to get it off my chest as I just lost a $100 wager due to be sniped by someone with 1 kills, if we were upclose and fought I would of killed him in seconds without him damaging me one, the only reason why he killed me was because of the sniper.

It’s been seen before in the likes of undertaker, Five Nights at Freddies, hell even Minecraft. 

It’s no mystery to anyone that r/FortniteBR is contributing to that directly.

I’m not going to pretend like I particularly enjoy this sub, that’s why I’m making this post, but I’ve noticed quite the problem recently. It’s a problem that comes with any fandom but especially video game fandoms, that being age.

We all remember that one annoying kid in CS 1.6 or Overwatch, the type who constantly trash talks in that annoying voice without any sense of visible empathy for anyone. Imagine that kid, but 100,000 of them, and all being in one subreddit. Being them toxic selves, arguing how console is better than PC, how Tfue is better than Ninja, how bloom (and recently crosshairs, how desperate do you have to be?) is causing all of their games to be lost.

That’s this subreddit, the one you’re reading in right now. We don’t know who those annoying kids are, but we definitely can stop them from being their toxic selves. If you find content on here that will only be funny to children (peekaboo mentality) or “OMG LOOK AT THIS FUNNY MEME” or “OMG THE CUBE DID THIS LOOK AT THAT GUYS” then immediately downvote.

If you can, post more quality content. If we really want this sub to transform we have to do some major reworks, and the mods will have to do it with us. I’ve noticed there are no rules against mid-effort content. Let’s change that, but first let’s change what we are posting.

Instead of a million cube threads, maybe just one megathread and everything else is deleted. Instead of memeing on this sub, let’s make a different sub for just memes. Let’s allow high quality content to be here, no quick scope compilations or ninja just talking for 30 seconds about how double pump should come back with a low effort caption slapped on it.

I believe we can take r/fortniteBR back to where it should be: A good place to talk about fortnite battlegrounds and how the game is coming along.

If they incorporated a mechanic like CSGO, you would instantly die in a second. Pros and other players will learn every spray for any gun and you will die. It won't be fun anymore. This is why we have 'Bloom'.

**How it evens the skill gap?**

Who's gonna win in a firefight. Tryhard Ramirez or Lil boi Jonesy. Of course Tryhard Ramirez would win. 

But the reason why bloom is so important is because. While Tryhard Ramirez is building. Her accuracy for the bloom is increased, which gives her a disadvantage. While Lil boi jonesy is standing still and has a more accurate accuracy. 

**What does this mean?**

Well it means that bloom puts good players at a disadvantage by making their shots miss, but if they want to be accurate, they become lil boi jonesy and have to stand still or not move to be accurate. Either way they both put you at a disadvantage, but that's the reason why we have bloom.",FortNiteBR

there are 21 days left, so 105 battle stars from daylies, that would instantly put me on tier 80  
plus the week 9 and 10 challenges that gather another 100 stars putting me on 90

&amp;#x200B;

ive been playing all day but im not very good (won my first game yesterday by camping!), most games i get an average of 500 hundred Exp. i also play 50v50 a lot because solo gives me anxiety... i dont have a lot of friends with the battle pass to help me out on this, so i guess this post is also a cry for help

Playing on a 1440p monitor but can't seem to maintain 144 FPS in some areas such as around tilted towers and loading screen where it drops to 80-90 sometimes.

I play on a 1080ti and a Ryzen 7 1800X both slightly overclocked. In my opinion it is weird getting low frames on those specs or am I wrong?

Would g-sync help? I'm not that quite hyped about it because it creates input lag.

Would downscaling to a 1080p monitor give me an increase in FPS in those certain scenarios?

Would a 1080p 240 hz monitor be beneficial for a competitive FPS gamer? I mean I have a beast of a pc so I'm not sure what machine you need for a 240 hz monitor.

Would 1080p be worse for competitive gaming in terms of vision?

All tips are appreciated!

EDIT: could streaming be the issue? I stream on GPU and use a dual monitor setup which is 144 and 60 hz",FortNiteBR

I play 50v50 and can get a lot of kills and usually a lot of sick plays but none of that in normal game modes. Ugh.

Whenever I try to play with people and see my low KD they say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre trash! Git gud‚Äù

I really am trying to improve and get better but everyone is just so much better. Anyone have any tips and tricks or something or possibly wanna play with me? 

Thanks.

TL;DR, I‚Äôm a bad player playing since Season 2 and am trying my best to improve and need some help. ",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Cuddle Team Leader: The way this skin stands out is terrifying, back on season 2 whenever I saw this skin I freaked out because at the time, we didn't really have a skin like that that was a huge bright color, she stands out so differently and unique that it's hard not to love that skin, plus the way it's designed and the way it looks is really cool too.

&amp;#x200B;

Level 80 Omega: This dude is just a pure badass, need I say more? everything about his design his outfit and the customization options are just badass, perfect skin for when you're really gonna rekt some lobbies.

&amp;#x200B;

Rogue Agent: This was actually my first skin, I never bought season 2 battlepass because I didn't know how it worked at the time, been playing since the game came out so a ¬£5 for a skin and a bunch of vbucks was an easy purchase for me, plus I love Halo, I feel rogue agent adds a unique look to the game

&amp;#x200B;

Vertex: The way this guy looks and is designed is amazing and awesome, something about his design, he has a look of someone who is very good at aerobics which is great for someone in combat.

&amp;#x200B;

There's many more I could name but with the amount of skins in the game it's hard to keep track, but what's your favorites?",FortNiteBR

Then, we got Tomato Temple, and there was mysterious lightning, incinerating cacti, counting down until something. That was awesome. Then the cube spawned, almost a month ago now.

At first the cube was intriguing, because we didn't know what it was doing or how it worked. After the 2nd rune was placed at Greasy Grove, however, the cube has become boring. We figured out what it does, and where it was going. Epic could've spiced it up by having the cube evolve over time, make it do new things, just *something*, but instead they have opted to make it complete the arduous process of rolling around the map for a month, and not changing whatsoever.

Just look at the cube megathread; it's completely dead, and has been for nearly a fortnight. 

Last season, we had small, but weekly map changes. We had the live rocket-launch event. We had objects around the map being rifted away, and towards the end, we had new objects rifting into the map. There was something new every week. Now, we've had nothing but a cube rolling around for a month. 

And what's more; it is rumoured that Season 5 will be extended until October 2nd. Other seasons have been extended, no biggie, you might say. Well other seasons got extended so that there is an 11th week in the season with no challenges, and then the new season comes out. This time, we already have an 11th week with no challenges. So, if the rumours are true, we have 2 weeks of no challenges and no changes ahead of us.

Unfortunately, it feels like Epic have really dropped the ball with hyping up Season 6 this time. I'm super excited for Season 6, but not because of any build-up, I'm just so eager for something to finally happen. ",FortNiteBR

My opinion on this, is that this f**ked up and should not happen.
I actually spent 950 vbucks on the battle pass + 900 vbucks 10 tier thing + ~15 tiers which equates to around 2250, which altogether makes 4100 vbucks spent on the season 2 battle pass to get the floss skin which means I will be ripped off 3600 vbucks which is $36/‚Ç¨36.

Every time game balance is brought up, at least 5 people always say ""bring back double pump and the game is balanced"". Come on, we all know that just isn't true. Double pump was always the dominant strategy before season 5. Even when the OP Tac SMG (which a lot of people want back as well for some reason) was in the game most people still ran double pump/double shotguns.

Now the game is even MORE favorable for shotguns. Not only have shotguns received many buffs (consistency, swap time), but SMGs have either been vaulted or nerfed to oblivion (accuracy, damage, falloff damage, fire rate). 

I guarantee if double shotgun was added back to the game without  a complete balance overhaul of the game, double pump would dominate once again.

You can literally win all day without trying and win within 10-12minutes per game. They‚Äôre delegitimizing all the other wins with this game mode. Id be fine with it, if it allowed one or two, but 4 winners?? That‚Äôs broken. Also, it‚Äôs incredibly annoying that people are flaunting they‚Äôre small penises with win percentages and numbers from constantly playing on switch servers (or mobile)and getaways(or both).The leaderboards aren‚Äôt even legit. Stats are becoming stupidly inflated for bad players. 

My partial answer would be to make a new category for LTM modes because they shouldn‚Äôt be looped in with regular BR wins for reasons stated above. For the other issue with cross-platform... I‚Äôm not really sure what the solution would be. Making another category for cross-plat would seem like too much, but not counting them as wins obviously isn‚Äôt a good solution. 

Idk, what‚Äôre your thoughts on certain LTMs counting as wins, more so with The Getaway?

I don't care for stats and I don't care about clout.. So what is there to even enjoy about winning after 400+ wins... 

It's just like who cares... winning just means the fight and the game is over... It's on the same level as losing because whether you win or lose your back in the lobby just starting another game.. the only difference when you win is that you can say that you won...

I don't know much else to say about the topic except for the fact that wins seem to leave me extremely unfulfilled....


I just wish that wins contributed to the content of this amazing game...


Don't get me wrong, this isn't me bitching... this is just me not wanting to give up or move on from Fortnite....

I took a week long break from Fortnite and switched to Blackout Beta just in the hopes of bein able to refresh the game for my self a bit....

What if he decides Blackout is more fun! Then we will lose all of his viewers and they will want to play Blackout instead of Fortnite!

The second reason I am nervous is because of all of the people who will leave because they are not good at building. One of the best parts of Fortnite is being able to crush the noobs who can't build! If the bad builders leave, then every time we see opponents will just be a build battle, and eventually they will be rapid fire and we won't have the materials to compete!

My story begins about 9 months ago, when my life was in its lowest lowest point. 

I was always a chubby kid growing up. The nick names I grew up with were names such as : 

-Fatty Mcfatingson
-Chubby Lard
-Mr. Kim
-‚ÄúWow looking at you just made me fatter‚Äù
Etc.

I was on the brink of depression EVERY single day and the only thing that kept me going was Fortnite. Now I know it sounds cheesy but for real this game blocked out all the negativity in my life and allowed me to not think about my concerning health issues for just a little bit.

Then one day after I got smacked on by a fake default I thought to myself..

What if I did 10 push-ups every time I died?

10 push-ups doesn‚Äôt sound like much..but to a person of my size &amp; a person of my skill..I ended up racking up quite a large amount of strength. And with that strength care weight loss. 

And a WHOLE LOT OF IT.

Fast forward 9 months I stand at not only the most skilled I‚Äôve ever been at a video game (over 700+ wins) but now I am comfortable in my skin for the first time in my life.

For those who say video games bring nothing but laziness I say neigh. 

I have a before and after pic [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/3F1L5Ir) if you guys want to see the progress for yourselves.

Thank you Epic, my life is forever changed.

As I was landing in tilted, I heard a voice. But not some kind of biblical voice from the heavens. More like a 10 year old breathing heavily into a microphone. As I approached the fish building, I heard it. Then I heard the person start speaking. It sounded like he was deapthroating his microphone, so I couldn't fully hear it, but I could make out ""gun"" ""person"" ""landing"" and ""else"". And then they started flying away. I started hearing the breathing as I neared not only the building, but also as I approached another person. They maybe could've been saying something like ""There's a gun where I'm landing and another person, I'll go somewhere else"". I stopped hearing the voice and breathing as they started flying to a different building. I know it wasn't either of my friends, because they were both talking and not saying any of those words. They also have higher quality mics, so that wouldn't have made sense. Neither sound like a ten year old or have someone in their house. It was also too loud for it to have been background noise. It's possible that Epic is testing voice proximity chat and it somehow glitched into my game.

Is Epic tasting voice proximity chat? Am I going insane? We may never know. ",FortNiteBR

Each day I see more and more posts about people announcing them quitting the game. I have a solution. Do more than just Battle Royale.


Obviously we already have more than just Battle Royale. Save the World has been out since the beginning. But what if there were more free game modes than just Battle Royale?


More game modes in the style of Battle Royale (same weapons, skins, etc.) but different objectives on different maps. There are certainly enough players to fill up the extra lobbies, and these new permanent game modes would draw in even more players.

Now you're probably thinking that this would make the game too much like other popular games, but I think
Now I'll go over some game mode ideas.

TEAM DEATHMATCH-

This is a pretty basic game mode. There would be two teams who spawn on different sides and kill each other. At the end of the game the team with the most points wins. Each kill would grant your team ten points. An additional 50 points would be earned through things such as opening supply drops (randomly falling in no man's land) or a llama (two randomly placed within no man's land). Suicides would reward the enemy team 10 points, but only if they had been damaged in that life. For example, if a player were to respawn and die inside their own territory due to fall damage etc. the enemy team would be rewarded no points. There would be a ""grace period"" at the beginning in which the teams would search their side of the map for materials weapons, etc. and prepare for the fight. Then after the time expires, the no man's land would open up and the game would play out. If an enemy were to enter the opposing team's safe zone, a message would appear on that team's screen informing them that a player had entered their territory. The enemy in the safe zone would also appear on the team's map until they left the safe zone.

Essentially it would be a lot like the final circle battle in 50v50 but with a more organized collection time and rather than last man standing it would be whoever has the most points at the end.

Team sizes would be 50, 25, and 10.

The map would consist of 3 sections. Two safe zones one either end, with the no man's land in between. There would be a storm dealing 10 DPS surrounding the whole area. A few meters of the safe zone would be a ledge into the ocean. The safe zone would be about the same size as pleasant park. On the wide end up it, it would connect to no-man's land. No man's land would be the same width as the safe zones, and as long as about two pleasant parks. When a player is killed, they would respawn on a large, indestructible platform in the sky above and behind their safe zone (the storm would deal no damage until landing in their safe zone. There would be a launch pad on the platform. The platform would be positioned far enough back from the safe zone that players would be able to land nearly anywhere in their safe zone, but could not be launched far enough to enter no man's land before landing. 

STORM SHIELD DEFENDER-

This gamemode is a bit more Fortnite themed than the previous. If you've played STW you'd know about storm shields. Essentially it's just a shield that stops the storm. This game mode would consist of four teams, each with a storm shield. In between the four corners of the map would lie a storm dealing low amounts of damage (1 DPS, I will explain why so low later). The objective would be to destroy the other teams' storm shields before the phase ends. Here is a detailed guide of how the phases would work.

Phase one (five minutes): Grace period
This phase would be essentially exactly like the grace period of TDM. You would not be able to leave your storm shield's circle.

Phase two (five minutes): Storm recession one 

In this phase, the storm would receed and open up the areas in between the teams' storm shields. This would be the time where the teams go and attack the storm shields. Obviously PVP would be enabled with a 5 second respawn time. The aim would be to damage the enemies' storm shields as much as possible (if not destroy them completely).

Phase three (two minutes): Storm return

In this phase, the storm would gradually return to how it was in phase one (one minute). After it returns fully there would be time for healing, rebuilding, etc. (one minute). 

Phases two and three would repeat as four and five, then six and seven, then eight and nine. The storm damage would increase as phases go on. First two, then five, then seven, then eight (similar to the progression of storm damage in battle royale). After these phases, phase ten would start.

Phase ten (until game end): Sudden death

As the name implies, there would be no respawning in this phase. On top of that, at the beginning of the phase, there would be an announcement saying

""Your storm shield's power is failing!""

At this time, you would begin taking .5 DPS inside your storm shield (still 1 DPS outside of it) and the storm shield itself would begin taking 10 DPS.

Now that I've gone over all the phases, I'll explain how the game would be played out. Obviously the aim would be to destroy all other storm shields. Once a team's storm shield is destroyed, they will not respawn and they will no longer have a safe zone to stay at during the return phase. Once all players on a team are dead, they will have lost.

A few other things to note:

Players would be able to stay in enemies' safe zones during the return phase, but they would be visible on that team's map and would not be able to damage the storm shield (they could damage other players however). They would respawn back at their own safe zone once killed. 

Legendary weapons would only be found in supply drops spawning outside of safe zones, and the spawn rates would be primarily centered around the very middle.
The teams would be made up of 25 people each. 

This gamemode would take place on a square map divided into maps with 4 identical square sections in the corners. Each section would be around the same size as tilted towers, with an area of the same size separating each safe zone from others and one in the center (So essentially a 3x3 square of areas the same size of tilted towers, the corners being safe zones).

CAPTURE THE LLAMA-

This game mode would essentially just be capture the flag but with a Llama. There would be a five minute period to gather weapons, resources, etc. before the main phase starts. Once it starts, players would be able to leave their area and go to the enemy's area. Once you get close enough to the enemy's Llama, you hold whatever button/key you have set for interact for two seconds before picking of the Llama. You would not be able to sprint while carrying the Llama (this requiring teammates to escort the carrier). The Llama could be dropped at any time but would return to the base after fifteen seconds. The fifteen second timer would pause while interacting, but not reset. Once the Llama is taken to the base, it would be dropped on a specific platform. It would then be opened by interacting with it for five seconds. After it is opened that team would receive a point. The first team to five points would win. After fifteen minutes, the game would end and the team with the highest score would win. If the score is even, it would enter a next point to win phase in which the next team to score would win.
These would not work with 100 total players, I was thinking more like 10-15 players on each side, let me know what you guys think though.

The map would be similar to the map of TDM, but with a Llama on each side of the map.

*TLDR: There should be more game modes in Fortnite. I won't bother explaining anything else just read it.*

Preemptive response to this seeming like too many other games:

The Battle Royale genre is dying fast. If Epic Games wants to have a fan base by the end of this year they need to add something new to Fortnite and I think this would be a great addition.

All of these modes would be free to play. On the game select screen, there would just be three additional buttons to press reading whatever the name of the gamemode is. All battle royale cosmetics would transfer throughout the new game modes. All tabs would look the same as in battle royale, except the lobby would look different (see next paragraph down), and there would be different challenges. Whether or not there would be battle passes seperate from the battle royale one would be up to Epic.

In TDM, you could have ten people in your party. In CTL you could have as many people in your party as the team size. Same for Storm Shield defender.

That's really all I have to say, let me know what you guys think, and suggest any othe game modes ideas you may have!",FortNiteBR

If you charge back the starter pack there is a VERY high probability that your Epic account will be permanently banned. If you just wait a few days for the hurricane to pass and for Epic to have a chance to respond to the drama, there is a much higher chance of you getting a resolution that doesn't involve a permanent ban.

Also, before the children say ""but Sony/Microsoft will stand up for me."" -- no they won't. Historically both companies have sided with the developer in similar circumstances. If you agreed to the terms of service, it's your problem. 

 Don't shoot the messenger pls. I just don't want to see the thousands of ""I was unfairly banned"" posts next week. ",FortNiteBR

Seriously epic, your game will die if we can't have hitscan snipers that reward 200+ damage on body shot. It's stupid that it's 2018 and we have to suffer through garbage like SLOW PROJECTILES and BULLET DROP. Ugh. I made a giant fort I don't want to have to fight against people reacting to me by building their stupid little luckerdog baby forts.


2) More time between weapon swaps. It's so stupid that it's like ONE SECOND to swap to a grappling hook. Batman doesn't fucking even fire that fast. Make it at least 2 or 3 seconds.


3) REMOVE GRAPPLE HOOKS ALREADY! No, 5 charges or 3 charges is still WAY too much. It's stupid how Mobility Creep is affecting this game SO poorly. I hope this trend dies, I'm tired of people dodging my shots because ""oh man I can react to you because I'm spider man"" garbage.


4) Please for the love of god make bloom doubled on everything that isn't a fully crouched and waiting first shot sniper. I hate how IDIOTS with a fucking surpressed AR (seriously?) can kill me from mid-range just because he thinks he's good. Only people who should dominate is us snipers! Let it be known that if you play this game like a little minecraft kiddo wandering around you'll be shot dead!


5) MAKE THE HEAD HITBOXES BIGGER! The tiny ass heads in this game are impossible to hit, what's the point if it's like 10% of their body? If you're out in the wild not building a wall everywhere you're walking, you deserve to be shot dead and it should be way easier to do that.",FortNiteBR

Skins shouldn‚Äôt ever define the player you are. I‚Äôve crushed Skull Troopers and I‚Äôve been crushed by no skins.

I hate all of these stupid people on IG and Twitter (and even sometimes on reddit) who complain when a skin comes back.

So what man, it‚Äôs all just cosmetics. You want to be unique? Then go ahead and make a dope combo with all the skins and backblings and picks and stuff and rock that to be unique. Rarity doesn‚Äôt matter.

Yes, Epic was a little deceiving when they said ‚Äúlast chance to buy Rogue Agent‚Äù but like whatever man, if you bought it for $5 you shouldn‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs rare. The real losers here are the people who bought it for $15 since they had to pay more.

I don‚Äôt think they would bring back battle pass stuff. Am I correct? Well, only time will tell. I sure hope they don‚Äôt, but if they bring back some older items I wouldn‚Äôt be too upset because I don‚Äôt have a lot of older things, and would like some of them.

I watched a video where supposedly the floss, wave, take the L, best mates, and Dark Voyager were rumored to come back (as well as Rogue Agent) but I don‚Äôt have wave and would really want it. I do however have Dark Voyager. Do I care if other people have it? Not at all.

BECAUSE SKINS DON‚ÄôT MATTER.

The fact that lower skilled players can spam on your wall and kill you anoys me. I like that dromgun got removed because it was such a strong spam gun. It dealt a load of damage to players which I think is unfair. You have a low chance of being hit when you spam and that is not a fair feature I think. I use it all the time myself but its just feels bad when you play squads and you get spammed by 4 people. I think we materials should have more hp or guns shound have less damage to walls. I like the fact that u can twohit woodenwalls with ur pickaxe. It is so much better than people having a low chance of being and a chance of dealing damage to anothes almost riskfree. I feel like RPG is also way too strong tho it only has 12 rockets. It destorys too many buildings and it deals too much damage consired it destroys so much. I would like if the RPG dealt less damage or destroy less building. Same goes for c4 except they nerfed it so its not that bad.

Every season, there‚Äôs a new gimmick to try and make the game feel different, i‚Äôm not a fan. The gimmicks are getting boring and it makes for games to be lame or pretty luck based during end game, especially with the cube and anti gravity fields. 

Rifts are sort of gimmicky but are necessary just to expand the map and let people land all over without having to worry about dying in the storm. 

The grappler however is super gimmicky. Shooting around like Spider-Man through tilted towers just to run away, it‚Äôs not really necessary, especially with the addition of shockwave grenades. 

I just want to play a normal game without having to worry about the final circle ending by Kevin or some dude who‚Äôs spamming grapplers because they didn‚Äôt buy the new Spider-Man game and want to feel alive. 

I mean, I don‚Äôt mind some of them like rifts because they actually serve a purpose, Kevin, the anti gravity fields and all that crap doesn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs just there so people have something to talk about.

Sure, it was cool at first and something new to freshen up the game a little. But now it's really just a huge pain if you end up being in one of them, I legit feel like a fat slug jumping around if I'm fighting in one.

One positive thing with the zones are that if you're in the storm with any type of ""boost"" item (grappler, impulses, etc) You can use them to get through the zone quicker than if you were to run, and as far as I see, that's the only plus about them.

I've had this happen over and over its just ruining the game, I can usually one shot if a person is low enough with a double barrel but I cant do anything with another gun. This game really needs to fix the shotgun problem because right now a grey smg at close range can beat out a a purple heavy. ",FortNiteBR

###Here are the basics:
- I play with a friend in the US, Bob.  I‚Äôm in France.
- Bob and I have been playing on iPads; want consoles; I got a Switch this summer.
- Bob was going to buy a Switch, but Epic removed screen recording, which is essential for us as we can‚Äôt always play together (different time zones; 7 hour difference)
- We are filthy casuals; We don't have a lot of time to devote to the game, but we really enjoy it.  The Switch was perfect before they removed video recording.

###Here are our options:
**Option 1**:  Xbox One S for Bob, Xbox One X for me.  
Pros: accounts not locked to Sony 
Cons: monthly subscription fee

**Option 2**: PS4 for Bob, PS4 Pro for me
Pros: No fees
Cons: accounts locked to Sony; I can no longer play on the Switch with my main account

**Option 3**: PS4 for Bob, custom PC for me
Pros: I am free to play on Switch (though not with Bob); I would get ‚Äúultimate control‚Äù.  I have a few Steam games that I play on a mac that would run better on a gaming PC (currently: A Hat in Time)
Cons: We would be obliterated on PC servers.  I do not want to play with keyboard and mouse and would much prefer a controller.

 Reality check. 

Nothing is ever exclusive. Just enjoy the skin and be happy you got it when you could.

What does the title mean?

Well it means that those who have beeN HERE SINCE SEASON 1- 

It means that people who have been around for a long time get an exclusive recap to obtain all items from the first season they started in, including those from season 1 (if there were any).

Basically those who have seen jump pads are going to start from season 1 and move up towards the now approaching season 6.

This is a side quest kind of thing,where you are given 30-60 days to farm up all the items you could have missed etc. 

This suggestion is not done just for nostalgia or something. It's because previous season items are unobtainable and till this very day from October I have never bought or obtained a battle pass item. (Apart from free pass).

So, what do you think? (Remember that this will vary based on when the account first joined the game.)

Especially after it was labeled as exclusive it came back.

I believe epic needs to make a statement regarding rarity and exclusivity.

Are battle pass skins safe? How about season 1 shop items? Twitch prime skins? Birthday event/getaway event?

These are many questions we kinda need answered as a community. My personal belief is that any item that requires effort outside of cash will stay safe IE: Season 1 seasonal shop, Battlepass skins, and the birthday/getaway event. I do believe it could be a possibility to see twitch prime skins return and of course any item that has hit the shop prior (excluding Mako that was a mistake)

The rarity of these items boil down to epics view on progression. Most games reward progression with exclusive items such as League of Legends and Rocket league as 2 examples. I would hope this is the direction that epic is taking because as someone thats been playing since day 1 all I gotta say is knees weak
Arms are heavy
There‚Äôs vomit on his sweater already

I have come to the conclusion that, exclusive refers to the deal itself, and not what the deal contains. For example, you can get the battle pass which contains a couple of skins and rewards and it cost 950 vbucks, but individually, the contents of the battle pass (skins and stuff) are worth far more than 950 vbucks. This would mean that the pack itself containing the skins would be the thing that‚Äôs exclusive, not the contents of the pack. So when they say the battle pass is ‚Äúexclusive to the season‚Äù it basically means that you can‚Äôt get these 5+ skins and all for 950 vbucks anymore after this season. You can get them individually, but not all together in a bundle like the battle pass. As far as business goes, this mindset will make them alot of money, and it will make buying/ selling accounts obsolete because the contents of the account will come back anyways. It sucks for the OG player who care about the rarity of their skins, but honestly, epic doesn‚Äôt care. It would be dumb of them to lose out on millions of dollars just because they don‚Äôt want to hurt some kids feelings. That‚Äôs how business works. ",FortNiteBR

The Muzzled weapon variants include the Muzzled Pump Shotgun, Muzzled Scar, Muzzled Burst Scar, and the Muzzled Double Barrel shotgun.

Paintball Guns: Paintball guns art guns that shoot paint balls, how surprising. When you are hit with a paint ball, It does 10 damage and slows your movement speed by 50%. Like the Grappler, the paintball gun has a permanent ammo clip that will render the gun useless when it is used up. This ammo capacity is 5 shots.

Launcher Gun: A type of shotgun that launches you in the opposite direction you fire. it has an ammo capacity of 3, accepts shotgun shells, and takes 2.5 seconds to reload. It does no damage at all because it is purely a movement item. It uses percussion to launch you in different directions so if you shot below you, you get launched upwards and if you shoot  in front of you, you get knocked backwards.

Shields: Shields are items that players can put up to block enemy fire. there are 2 types of shields, Wooden, and Metal. Wooden shields have 150 health and metal ones have 300. The shields have no AOE resistance.

I'm too Lazy to describe these weapons because it's 12:00 AM where I live so here they are:

3. Double Machine Pistol
4. Suppressed Burst A.R

I live in San Diego and have Cox Communications and am getting extreme download packet loss (12%-58%) when connecting to the NAW servers. It only happens in Fortnite, and only in the NAW servers. If I connect to NAE or play another game, it is 100% fine. I‚Äôve noticed that it‚Äôs worst during peak hours (7pm-11pm). My speeds are 120/12 and my PC has an i7 and a 1070. I‚Äôve tried everything I know to do and just want to play Fortnite without 80+ ping in the East servers. If anyone can help, or if Epic could address this, that would be incredible. Thanks all!

ps. I don‚Äôt seem to be the only person having this issue connecting to the NAW with my particular internet company.

Thanks again, everyone. ",FortNiteBR

If you want to be cooler than someone at something then you should simply be better than them at it. 

Many people never had a chance to obtain old ‚Äòexclusive‚Äô items. You never truly know someone‚Äôs situation. Many people were not playing the game back then and to lock very cool items to people who just played back then isn‚Äôt fair. Some people never had the opportunity to obtain these items. Just because you knew of something before others shouldn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre entitled to things more than anyone. 

If people are willing to pay for old items, they should. That‚Äôs their ‚Äòpunishment‚Äô for not being able to obtain this item when it was originally released. I for instance never played before season 4 and would pay an embarrassing amount for the ‚ÄúTake the L‚Äù emote.

Yes the moderators have a hard time with the amount of work on their shoulders, but it feels like they don‚Äôt even try sometimes. And it‚Äôs impossible to make a decent suggestion or share an in-game bug because it‚Äôs pushed out of existence by the insane amount of garbage posted.

There's a disgusting amount of Aim Acceleration to the point where shotguns are impossible to use and the spray and pray meta is almost the only way to get a kill.

22,Dan_lol,1534633905,98ft6z,35,/r/FortNiteBR/comments/98ft6z/suggestion_for_streamer_mode/,0,Suggestion for Streamer mode.,"As you all know, streamer mode was created so that it would better help streamers from being stream sniped. This would allow their IGN (In game name) to be displayed as ""Streamer (182)"" for example. While this was a great idea, I think that it could be improved. One thing I would change would be that instead of allowing anyone to use the streamer mode, I think that Epic Games would have to give streamers the ability to use it. If you think about it, how many times have you been in the same game as a decently sized streamer/youtuber that has around a few hundred viewers watching their streams? Maybe only a few times out of hundreds of games. Now, if you think about how many times you have been in a game where AT LEAST 10 people have streamer mode on, what are the chances of them actually streaming? I feel that people are using the feature as it was not intended to be used. I know that when I have been killed by someone with streamer mode on, I checked their name after and when looking around on YouTube or Twitch, there is nothing there. They aren't a YouTuber or Streamer. To wrap this up I will just say that I think only decently big YouTubers or streamers should have the ability to use the streamer mode feature. They could maybe even make an application to get to use it. Anyways, those were my thoughts and I would appreciate if you could point out any flaws you think I had or something you did not agree with. Thx for reading this.",FortNiteBR

This clown will replace him, as seen in Save The World (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/97epmi/til_tomatohead_used_to_be_a_clown/)

More proof- the Party Parade set (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/94c4e2/this_is_the_only_item_in_the_party_parade_set/) will be completed by something, maybe a clown. Road trip skin hints possibly? If someone can find a clown sign in any of the loading screens reply with a link. 

I’ve also unearthed a link to a clown set suggestion (https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/search?q=Clown) Epic commented on it with a hint to Fortnite players being scared of clowns. I wouldn’t put it past them to make it into a real skin.

Anyway, calling it now. Not everything is as it seems.

So I’m in the middle of a game, couple eliminations in my pocket, and the next storm is about to start closing in. I see another player building up, so I do the logical thing and shoot the ramp down to get a free elim. Dude was building a single wood ramp, and didn’t attempt to secure it whatsoever. Literally can’t get any easier than that.

I gather his materials, and next thing I know, this dude starts inviting me to a party left and right, one after the other (I literally got 15+ invites in like 30 seconds). I let it continue for a bit until I can get into the circle and comfortably join the party, because I wanna see what this guy’s issue is. 

I join the party, and notice there are 5 or 6 other people in it at the time, so I simply say “What’s up? What do you want?”

Immediately, the dude I kill starts calling me names and is harassing me about how I’m such a bad player because I killed him by knocking out his ramp, and yada yada yada. Then his buddies all join in on the same thing. These dudes aren’t letting up. They go into my Xbox profile, and they start making fun of me because I have a low friend count. Apparently, friends on Xbox Live is a direct correlation to your friends in real life... who knew... and then they go into my captures and start making fun of some of the things I’ve captured over time. These guys were literally relentless. Thankfully, I have it set so that no one can see my full name, because they started asking for it, and if they had it, they no doubt would’ve started searching for me on social media.

But the name calling continued, they were scrounging around to find any little details about me to get under my skin. Calling me a trash person without friends, that I should kill myself, that they’d kick my ass in real life, etc. etc. etc. the full extent of what you’d imagine is cyber bullying.

Now, I’m in my mid 20’s, and I’m in a pretty good place in life. It’s obvious by their voices and their speech mannerisms that these guys are high schoolers, maybe 8th graders. I obviously wasn’t letting what they said get to me in a way that made me feel down, but imagine if I was a younger kid. Imagine if Fortnite was my one outlet to feeling okay about myself and life. What if I actually didn’t have many friends? The things these guys were saying, could have really been hurtful to someone, and cyber bullying is never an okay thing. Kids have gone into worsening depressive states due to cyber bullying, and have even gone as far as taking their lives. It’s a serious issue, and no matter what, you shouldn’t be toxic enough to be doing what these kids did last night over an elimination. 

This is a game. You won’t win 100% of the time, no matter how good you are. A little banter here and there isn’t bad. Getting upset, isn’t bad. But the turning point is when you start to harass people in the way that these guys did last night. 

I’m not going to share their names, and I’ve already blocked them on Xbox. But please remember that this is a game, and toxicity to the point of cyber bullying is never okay. You never know who you’re talking to and what they may be going through in life.",FortNiteBR

I used to be great during duo runs because I could efficiently take out a team by myself with a good well placed shot.  It didn’t happen a lot but I would have a chance to fight back. Now these days you might as well die. It’s practically 1v4 when they have shotgun/smg.

I’m not saying players should easily 1v2+ any team but a good calm player should be able to do some work when they deserve it so their partner can clean up.

Suggestion: At point blank range all shot guns should do instant kill damage. 200 damage max. Im talking like a good foot or two away. After two feet the damage drop off can go to the current system of 200% headshot damage. That way if we miss even one pellet, the enemy can pull out their smg and spray us down.

The pellets would change to fill the crosshair a bit more much like a circle so there’s more of a chance to miss if the entire crosshairs isn’t filled with someone’s head.

This way the shotguns won’t be op unless you allow an enemy to get into your personal space.  This would make it viable because during the reload/cocking times the smgs can continue to hit. Their speed and aim allows them to do much more damage during that time. 

Also let’s make the heavy have only 6 shells. And the pump 4. Just to see

I haven’t thought this through enough but I’m sure the commenters will tell me how stupid and flawed this would be

People kept making posts about the easter skins coming back, epic brought them back. This sub endlessly wailed about assault trooper, and she was brought back just as it was peaking. In short, Epic listens to what people wants in the shop.

But they don't do it for the players. Epic doesn't care about their customers, they only care about money, like any company would. Their customer service and how they treat the other mode (neglected it for months, super vague about development, and literally trying to kill their own game WAY more than what was happening with BR, even with the first day of the compact SMG's release). Sure, they re-release the skins, but only after giving them lots of time for hype to build up so more people will buy V-Bucks to buy the skins. They're corporate, it makes sense even if we don't like it.

Epic decided to make one of the skins have a SUPER hyped up return. That skin is power chord. And guess what? This subreddit brings her up whenever possible. Especially in the storm shield one bot's shop threads that come every day. STOP! This is a PSA telling you to stop. If you want power chord to come back, you gotta stop building the hype. The more hype there is, the more epic is going to wait to bring her back, if they ever do, that is. And epic is going to get more money and continue this behavior in the future because it's working.

If you want power chord to come back, this subreddit as a whole has to stop bringing her up more than the rest of reddit brings out fucking Trump in conversation. Epic will release her sooner, on the side because it will seem like people *won't* want to buy her anymore, and we'll all be happy.

And yes, I know I just wrote an entire post about power chord telling everyone to *not* talk about power chord. This is meant to serve as the last log on the fire for a while, let it die out and we'll see positive results! Because, Fortnite is a growing game, and if this continues, she will literally never be released back into the store to make the hype seem intense.",FortNiteBR

Honestly last week I would of said that the challenges are f\*cking boring and time-wasting, but if you ask me this week I will say they are still f\*cking boring and time-wasting only difference is, they are now f\*cking annoying, trust me - ask the people who've attempted the time trial near tomato X\_X.

Video games in general are created for your enjoyment, they are there to make you have fun. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with a little challenge here and there, but when you chuck Fortnite challenges in the mix, something IS wrong.

There is absolutely no time well-spent, no cool things happening or discovered and most of all there is no f\*cking fun in these shitty, stupid challenges.

It's an ongoing cycle. New week, new random teammate who jumps off a cliff after shooting his clay pigeons.

Just ask yourselves the question, 'Have you ever seen a challenge that you were excited or eager to do?'.

No. You haven't. That is why me and 100% of the people I know go to the internet to find what is between an oasis, rock archway and f\*cking dinosaurs.

We need change for these challenges Epic.

2.) Has 15-25% opacity so it doesn't get in the way of your vision.

I suggest we get v-bucks if we win a BR game. Now now, relax. Let me explain. I know this might have been said before. 

So, hear me out. I say that a win gives you about 5 V-Bucks and a kill, 1 or 2 V-Bucks. But there is a catch. There is a limit per day that you can get V-Bucks. My thinking is 25 V-Bucks limit per day.

Now it's simple math, it takes 8 days to gather 200 V-Bucks, a simple, green emote from the store. 16 days 400 bucks, 32 days 800 and 80 days to gather 2000 V-Bucks. Now that's a lot of days. But you get something by playing for almost 3 months. Now we get nothing. Seriously, nothing. I know it's a free to play game and you can get the battlepass with daily missions and it actually gives you 1500\~ v-bucks but I think what I propose makes sense.

I don't think it's hard to balance these numbers, but Epic just think about rewarding the player for once.",FortNiteBR

Personally as someone from ftp launch date I could easily say season 1-2. Though I was a noob I still had 3 wins at the end of season 2. I started gaining wins during season 3 and losing wins during season 5.

## Why do you think it was fun during season 2?

Rewarding. It was rewarding. It kept me hooked. To prove I was hooked I've had 2 accounts (Look at my post history) and one I had bought the battlepass and the other I hadn't. But still made it to the same tier. I bring this up because the battlepass was rewarding, only 70 tiers and you could get 1 tier per day. It was fun and if you played extra you could get the black knight quicker. Too this day I stand by season 2 having the best cosmetics. (Also the guns were balanced and made sense)

## Why was season 1 fun?

We all know about the season shop during season 1. Personally I preferred it to the battlepass system. While grinding you would get items you could unlock. More casual players could unlock items from the item shop. The levels were quite low and so was the skill cap. Though not playing much I got to level 7. (I know I'm basically pro) however I was playing different games. I was quite hyped for cod that year with its return. However I have 2 friends with the mako glider. Personally I loved how spread out and balanced everything was. The loot distribution was close to perfect. The amount of players landing in the towns was amazing. This is because retail had more loot then pleasant but both were a good landing spot. Pleasant had more loot then greasy at times. Greasy had more loot then the farms and lonely. The farms and lonely had more loot then wailing. It was a nice system. Everything was fine.

# Then the system broke

January 17th was the day everything became unbalanced. Tilted Towers was added. With the most loot in the game came the most players. However it wasn't good loot distribution. Tilted had the most loot **BY FAR** this caused short matches that felt like long stretched matches. 70 or so people would die at the start and then the 30 left would turn into 20 within 2-3 minutes then the 20 would turn into 10 within 2-3 minutes and then it was a deathmatch. The first 70 to die would take around 6 minutes. It takes around 12 minutes to finish a game (15 if you're unlucky and max 20 if there's campers.) However no one would have fun. It was a repeat each game. Some stop played earlier then others. I will never forget how hard this update impacted the game.

# The downfall in fun

Though you may not realise it. Fortnite was still growing after tilted towers. New players jumped in and landed into tilted. The game was getting more popular. Drake popped in and boosted the game aswell as Ninja. However Fortnite started leaning more towards very bad players. Removing double pump, adding more smgs. But this was fine. It wasn't the worst thing. This is because it started getting worse. The updates after updates were too much. Every week a new item would be out. This is great but it ruined the flow of the game.

## Miss an update and you're skill is decreasing

Port a fort, guided missle, tommy gun, P90. Anyone of these updates you missed it was over. If you didn't know about port a fort you could have gotten killed by a play with it. Guided missle and it's broken state. Tommy gun being an smg and better then an ar. P90 being the best gun by far, everything was changing. Shopping carts were added and it got less fun. Epic infested the game with loot and it ended up killing the game.

# The breaking point

Reddit: It's over epic, we have the majority vote! Epic: You underestimate my power to remove fun Reddit: Don't try it Epic: Tries it Reddit: Slices the player base in half

Season 5 was the breaking point for me and others. The fun was removed. I now play playground only. But soon I'll stop. The community has turned toxic. I'm sorry but I'm gone and so is a lot of the community. xoxo epic thanks for the amazing memories.

TL:DR - The game has gotten boring with all of the updates and especially the map update. It turned to casual players as well.",FortNiteBR

There's a picture of it.

There's no reason to have it rotated THAT much.

First of all, no hate intended, but I personally feel after watching him that he must have started doing this after seeing Counter-Strike pros doing the same(ish) thing, but he's taken it a step further and rotated it even more for some weird reason.

You can even see his wrist is totally NOT straight while using it, while pro Counter-Strike players always keep their wrists straight because they're only on a 45 degree angle.

If he continues to play like this his wrist is going to be fucked later in life. No way around that.

PS, I have nothing bad to say about Poach himself. I have barely watched any of his stream, I just know for a fact his wrist is going to be fuuuuucked if he doesn't change it up a bit. 45 degrees, fine, 90? Not so much!",FortNiteBR

I prefer to use scoped ARs and thermals because of the multi shot and the lack of bullet drop. 

My question is, how do you even counter snipers? If somebody is 100 or less meters than you and they’re focused on you, you’ll die if you peek. I was at fatal the other day in the top 2 and this guy have a bolt and I had a purple thermal. I was in a 3 story base and he was hiding in a shack not moving, keeping his sights on me. 

See the issue is, it’s impossible for me to peek in that instance because of the fact that he’s focused on me and his shot is incredibly unlikely to miss. I built up another story and the same thing, Guy was focused on me and I couldn’t do anything about it. I shot some grenades at him and quickly switched to my thermal, the dude didn’t budge and the second I peeked, I got one shot despite having 200 health. 

What’s even worse was that I had a 9 kill game and that was his 2nd kill. 

How does one defeat a sniper when you don’t have one/can’t peek because of sure death?

In retrospect, I probably could’ve gone through the back of my base and had just run to the circle and hoped he died in the storm but considering this guy was so persistent, I probably would’ve died anyways. 

It’s really frustrating, the gun that I hate to use always manages to kill me. It’s to a point where if you run, people will still hit a moving target lol. 

So yeah, any advice?",FortNiteBR

(heavy packet loss since the last two weeks).," Hi guys at Reddit and potential epic employees reading this. I play  Fortnite since season 1, fell in love with it mid season 2. This game  is awesome. The meta is not perfect, but it's getting better.., I guess.  Thank you for that. This message is to know about the future of LATAM  (Latin America, including Brazil) Servers. We have Brazil only. Which  for me, it's fine.   


We  have been getting lobbys with packet loss (ranging from 5% to 250%, and  I have seen 3500% once lol), every 7/10 games. It's insanely  discouraging and sad that you just can't play, even though your internet  is working fine (tested in other games and low ping no packet loss),  then you see NA and EU with private lobbies functioning perfectly  lately, and normal games having 0% packet loss.  


Here's a clip (I'm not gonna clip everything, you can see the VOD I guess, but it's lots of games) with packet loss: [https://clips.twitch.tv/ObedientDarlingSushiKippa](https://clips.twitch.tv/ObedientDarlingSushiKippa) It's clearly not the best example, but I don't really have much time to prepare a whole video about it.  


We  in this side of the map do ""scrims"" and ""snipes"" too. Normally you have  packet loss until late game. Imagine having a fight earlier than that.  It's just not fun man. This has happened way too much on the last two  weeks.  


QUESTION 1: What's happening to the Brazil servers? Why they suck so much?  


QUESTION 2: Are we going to have some more latam- dedicated servers for example in Chile, Argentina?  


QUESTION  3(off-topic): Can we get a summer skirmish for latin America with a  prize pool of $100, we'd be happy with that, we feel forgotten. Thanks.  


TLDR;  BRAZIL SERVERS ARE HAVING PACKET LOSS SINCE 2 WEEKS. PLAYERS CAN'T  SCRIM, SNIPE, OR PLAY THE GAME FOR FUN BECAUSE 7/10 GAMES LOBBYS COME  WITH PACKET LOSS UNTIL LATE GAME, AND SOMETIMES THE WHOLE MATCH. THIS  POST IS TO HEAR WHAT EPIC HAS TO SAY ABOUT IT.

Long story short, it's a randomly generated match, every match. The bus travels are different, chest spawns are different, loot spawns are different, the players in your game are different, even the main mechanic of shooting is bloom (which is essentially a roll-a-dice style of where your bullet will go, which I personally think is an idiotic mechanic being that Epic Games is trying to push Fortnite into ESports). See, i'm a rage streamer, so you'll see me rage, because of the game itself, and what I do wrong, and if i'm not playing as good as I should. However, I feel the community as a whole rages at each other and uses KDA and stats to bring each other down, which I personally think doesn't make any sense, because again, the entire game is RNG. The only way to be consistent is to play extremely safe and camp the entire game, which is PERFECTLY FINE if that's the type of player you are, however, I personally think playing like that can be a lot of unnecessary effort, tiring, and quite frankly boring. I know a lot of players like playing like me, which (as I title my streams) uselessly aggressive, however, me and people I know constantly get people who ask how many wins we have or our highest kill game or our KDA, etc. If you're proud of your stats, be proud, but don't bring others down because of it, remember, it's a game essentially about luck, and some of us just have some really, really bad luck. HOWEVER, don't use this as an excuse to why you're playing bad, remember, it's OKAY to admit you're not playing up to par or that you're doing some things wrong, we all have things that we could improve with, even pros, people I somehow run into way too much when playing solo squads (pros currently on my hitlist for killing me: Typical Gamer, OPSCT, thiefs, Parallax, TSM_Myth, 72Hrs (even though I killed him)). All in all, it's still just a game, a luck-based game at that, so next time you think about stats or dying to another player, maybe the other player is just better than you, maybe there's things you can correct about your own gameplay, either way, just have fun, and enjoy the game and the players you meet, there are some pretty good players, pretty hilariously bad players (this is not a bad thing, trust me, I had fun being a bad player, take pride) and some pretty angry players out there (still funny). Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

I came up behind a duo and took them both out at a speed that i've never done before. It was 4 shots, 4 headshots, two dead drifts. Took a few seconds.

I don't know but the gun still seems to have a use. I've been rocking Deagle, Double Barrel, Meds, Meds, Meds recently and it works like a charm.

I disagreed because the new snipe has low bullet drop, and also has high damage. He argues that the bolt is better because if you shoot once with the bolt at someone in the open you can get another shot in before they start building, with the 50. Cal you can not because of the reload time. he says. I argued there that most people once getting sniped at they build no matter what. Then he says that no matter what the bullet travel time is too slow. I tell him there, it is just like when we received the hunting rifle. that gun was so much different from the bolt action sniper rifle. I told him you have to adapt to it. and he still argues that the 50. Cal is only good for when they are standing still.

About the aimbot use. Well it seems to be tuned a bit down so it is not so obvious. What do you think? 


I have came a cross also a lot that shotgun etc. shots / damage doesn't register. Could it be some kind of nodamage cheat? Or is it just fauled game mechanics or lag. What do you think?


What about the speed difference versus some players. Is it also cheating or lagswitch. What do you think? You know the situation when you suddenly go to slow motion mode. 


I play Xbox with controller. I ran into keyboard and mouse players far too often. What do you think how a big of a problem this really is right now. They have huge advantage over the controller ""bots"". What do you think?

Its now down to the final 5, **Bob has killed zero people**, yet as he moves inward out of the shadows, he gets to run across** literally dozens of loot piles created by the hard work of other players, switching his green SMG for a p90, swapping his gray tack for a heavy, 0 kill bob is now quite stacked in loo**t and then proceeds to take the win, knocking out the guy with 10 kills while he was distracted killing the third man left.                     

*The problem* \- Why does bob the 0 kill camper get to sift through other peoples killed loot piles, thereby having a loadout as if he killed a dozen people, but he never needing to kill anyone and got to hang out in the shadows the whole match while getting stronger and stronger?                         

*The solution* \- Imagine if when you killed a player, you didn't have to frantically grab the good loot while getting shot at from 4 sides, imagine upon killing a player, all their loot instantly appeared in your inventory screen as something you can optionally switch out to one of your 5 playable slots.                   

*What does this change?*  \- People who actually kill other players during the match are extremely rewarded with a variety of gear to swap into and out of their 5 playable slots, people who hide and get zero kills get no such luxury and have a barren wasteland void of dead-body loot, forced to either kill someone to get loot (hence play the game) or go find another chest.                          

*What about squads? -* If you or a squadmate kills someone, the pool of the loot is visible to entire squad, however if someone puts one of those party loot items into their 5 playable slots, it disappears from the other players as an option to use.               

*What if I kill 1 squad mate but his other mates are still alive? -* You instantly get transferred all his carried loot in his 5 slots + ammo and traps, the party loot of the squad is still unavailble until someone kills the final squad member.",FortNiteBR

My school years where horrible due to bullying etc which made a big impact on my life. Since i left school I've struggled to come to terms with this world dude to trust issues and depression I feel as if everyone is out to do me wrong. When epic released fortnite last year I begun playing and im still playing to this day 9 months later because not only do i have a lot of fun I feel as if I gain confidence talking to random duo or random squads and 98% of the time you guys are friendly and good team mates and it gives me more of a reason to believe theres nice genuine people left out there. 

The main reason I want to thank epic is because instead of sitting in my room lonely depressed and anxious I can happily sit in my room and game on fortnite which has become one of my all time favourite games (im 21 years of age) and it helps me escape the real world. 

If someone wants to comment you need to seek help I did and still do talk to professionals but it doesent always help.

I'm a person that appreciates everything even the tiny things. So thank you epic games for taking my attention, bringing out the kid in me, allowing me to gain confidence and most importantly for giving me something that i can enjoy in life when everything else seems dull and boring :(

Reeeee!"," I've been an avid gamer since the early 90's. Back when your Daddy was in uniform and you were still in liquid form. I had no idea what the game was all about but I'm no stranger to twitch shooters or survival games. Was a competitive champion at Quake 3, UT, Tribes 2 and CS. Back when I had reflexes.  Stopped playing FPS's after MW2. Getting pwned by 12 year olds was not fun. ""I fucked your Mom!"" Good for you, she's 78.  
Anyhoo, game is free, I had time, thought I'd load it up and see what the fuss is about. Read a game guide and gave it a shot. Played a few rounds, realized I had no clue yet, and read some more.  
Whelp, six hours later I forced myself to step away for the night. This game is a lot of fun. Easy to learn, hard to master. Spent a lot of time spectating, I died a lot, holy crap you guys are good. Learned more watching y'all than reading any game guide.  
It's not a ""dropped into a firefight, GO GO GO"" like CS or CoD, and it's not dropped naked and helpless into buttfuck nowhere like Rust or DayZ. It's accessible. And fun, right off the bat it is fun.  
Sound is crucial and that's about the only advantage I think I had in game. I've got an expensive 7.1 system on my PC and I could pinpoint every noise. So yeah, sneaky bastard. Stealth action is still my favorite genre of single player game so this fits right in.

Now the real question is will it return? Yes i understand that it was a limited time event but that does not mean it cant come back again for a limited time. They could easily tie the the game mode in with the upcoming avengers movie. The next avengers movies is pretty far away, but the advertisement campaign is not. If they were to do this it would be a win-win for both Fortnite and Marvel because Fortnite gets to satisfy its fans and marvel get an amazing bit of advertisement that reaches the fastest growing fanbase in gaming history. If this were to be added to be added back into the game we could probably expect it in March 2019.",FortNiteBR

I went through all the most used stretched resolutions ( 1600 x 1080, 1440 x 1080, 1154 x 1080, and 1024 x 1080 ) what I have found is that any resolutions under 1600 as your ""ResolutionSizeX"" will cause your crosshair to look transparent and almost impossible to see. My guess is this is epic's way of getting people off of playing stretched because it gives players a strategical advantage.

If you don't know what stretched does it gives the player playing a lower resolution but stretches the screen horizontally making heads and bodies bigger. Counter Strike pros do this A LOT and most of the community plays this way as it gives them the best chance to get headshots. In fortnite it also gives you a higher FOV which is why most pros are using it atm.

This is just what I found if someone finds a way to fix the crosshair then you would be an OG. For players like me who played on this res for years ( 5 years in CS for me ) then this is tragic. Sensitivities feel different and it feels like learning a whole new game. Thanks for reading hope epic decides to revert or change it so we can have our center dot back :)

What makes this Fun / Unique? -                        

\-The ""President"" takes **25% less damage from all sources for each bodyguard still alive**.  Each body guard eliminated makes the president easier to kill.                           

\-If the President dies before the body guards, **the entire team is instantly killed**                           

\-The President shouldn't be defenseless nor should he be a hard-to-kill wrecking machine, therefore the President only gets 1 gun, a golden desert eagle, the other 4 slots can be used for grenades / healing / etc but not more guns, he's given 1 golden deagle sidearm at the start and this will be his one and only weapon the entire game.                     

\-When queing a squad for this ltm - 1 party member is randomly selected to be ""The President"" - his back bling and pickaxe skins still apply as normal, but his skin is replaced by a presdential suit so that all opposing squads can clearly see who the president is for each team.  I would also go so far to say that if you're within a proximitiy of the president, an arrow appears over his head like you see on friendlies in 50/50 matches.                 

\-An alternative presidential selection method would be to give all players a temporary president skin in their locker, any pre-made squad could have 1 party member use the skin and when queing, and then the server knows who to select as president, should a squad not bother or know to use the skin, a random president will be selected among them.",FortNiteBR

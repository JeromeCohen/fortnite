It seems like a big departure from the bright, light-hearted, or even silly theme that has been present since the begining, and it's really turned me off, even to the point of pretty much quitting the game altogether.
I'm understand that a whole lot of people are going to disagree with me, but to me, I feel like they're going over the top, and it's been that way for a couple months now starting with Tomato Temple and the weird/eerie themes there. Again, I'm most likely in the minority, but I can't say I agree with Epic that this is the way they should go when they a playing such a big role in influencing many kids of all ages around the world.

I'm in the UK and I tried Fortnite yesterday.

It was not a success.

I dropped into a map ok (leaving aside the fact I have to pay to have anything but a crap avatar, and that cost is $20!  What a rip off!) and found a couple of guns.  So I headed for the middle of the map, as that seemed to be where the action was.

After 5 mins of running full speed the ""storm"" over took me and I died.

So I retried, and got the same result.

So I retried and this time landed closer to the center.  Again I found a gun (at this point I was in game 3 and still hadn't seen an opponent to shoot) and started towards the center.

The storm arrived and again I coudn't outrun it.

The were maybe 20 people in the games tops.  I was told repeatedly that it was 100 people all vs all in the free battle royale mode.

So I ""played"" 3 games and saw no action.  Just got killed by a mechanic that moves faster than my top characters running speed with sprint held down.

Not much fun.

Then the DLC costs became apparent and I can't support this sort of game economy, it is a con.

Better to buy a complete game that has some additional flavour and skins stuff than a game that requires hundred of dollars of DLC to use to make you competitive.

So I was dissappointed and hoping that my experience is a one off, or a location based issue?  I really hope that what I went through is not the common experience for most players?

Is it?  Or is Fortnite actually this crap worldwide?",FortNiteBR

Seeing as season six definitely has a Halloween style theme I‚Äôm led to assume that season 7 will have a sort of Christmas theme. The tier üíØ skin may possibly be a sort of Santa Claus styled skin and another skin may be an elf (I know we got the Lachlan elf last year but it‚Äôs possible we could get a new one) and maybe a thanksgiving style one as well seeing we just didn‚Äôt get a thanksgiving skin this season. One of my suggestions for season 7 would be to change the grassy regular parts of the map to snow and to change the desert areas to regular grass like most of the current map is.

P.S. I still want epic to let those who didn‚Äôt finish the omega challenges complete them and give us full omega with lights. They let us upgrade the ragnarok and drift skins past their season so it should be the same thing for season 4. Barely anyone wears the omega anymore so it doesn‚Äôt make sense why they wouldn‚Äôt let us finish his XP",FortNiteBR

It's sad you, know. But it's' reality. Epic refuses to fix their game, and continues to cater to the casual fan base/mobile players. RIP in peace fortnite.

It's one of the best looking skins in the game and I can't fully appreciate it because I can see where the lights on him should be illuminated and they're just empty. 

I can only play a couple of hours in the evening a few times a week due to real life commitments, and the amount of time to fully unlock omega was no small amount. 

Level 60 in season 4 was only half way to level 80 and it would have taken me hours of grinding to get there. Especially because Fortnite rewards social players who can get exp boosts by playing in squads, whereas people who can only play when time permits have to make do with whoever's online at that time or just grind out solo matches. 

Since season 4 Fortnite have allowed upgradeable skins to be leveled by exp even after the season ends, omega and carbide are the only upgradeable skins that cannot be upgraded and it really grinds my gears. 

Let people like me finish upgrading our Omegas! We paid for the battle pass and earned the omega skin by playing enough to level up to battlepass level 100, don't stop us from enjoying a skins full potential just because we couldn't grind the levels out through hours of gameplay. 

Even if you only let us unlock the orange/red variant that's similar to the other states. 

I understand that people who grind out the levels through hours of playtime deserve some recognition for their support of the game, but give them something new and standalone as a reward that evidences their commitment but doesn't screw the rest of us out of enjoying our battlepass level 100 reward properly.

Rant over. 

TLDR: 
Allow people to unlock the first red/orange final stage Omega by leveling the skin with exp like all other upgradeable skins (except carbide), so we can enjoy it properly without having to look at where the lights on his body should be.

Reward high level players with something unique that doesn't impact people who have reached battlepass level 100 but don't have the time to grind out season levels.

P.S. I'm extra salty because I purchased the Oblivion pickaxe and glider to complete my Omega set. ",FortNiteBR

With the latest shooter also featuring a Battle Royale mode for the first time, understandably the spotlight has shifted away from Fortnite - at least for now.

At the time this article was written, here's where the battle of the Battle Royales stand - at least in the Twitch-verse:

https://media.comicbook.com/2018/10/bo-twich-1138660.jpeg

Fortnite has been the game to beat since Epic Games launched their free-to-play Battle Royale mode and the title itself has continued to smash through records left and right since then. Though the dethroned spot may only be temporary, we're excited to see even more Battle Royale options out there for those that enjoy this particular mode of play.

For those that might be unfamiliar with Blackout, Treyarch describes the new mode as ""the Black Ops universe comes to life in one massive battle royale experience, combining Black Ops signature combat and the biggest map in Call of Duty history. Play as fan favorite characters and battle through iconic settings in an all-out survival and elimination experience.""

Just like any other Battle Royale mode - and Fortnite in particular, players will drop down onto their desired place on the map and be forced to immediately scrounge for good gear. Build up, build fast, and survive! That's the name of the game in Blackout and the new mode has been met with pretty positive reviews since it left beta.

Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is now available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC! For more about the game itself before hopping into that lobby:


""Black Ops is back! Featuring gritty, grounded, fluid Multiplayer combat, the biggest Zombies offering ever with three full undead adventures at launch, and Blackout, where the universe of Black Ops comes to life in one massive battle royale experience featuring the largest map in Call of Duty history, signature Black Ops combat, characters, locations and weapons from the entire Black Ops series.""",FortNiteBR

A lot of people have suggested two things that could be implemented to increase the material gain, one is to straight up make it so that the game gives you 1,5/1,25 times more material, or what I would prefer, make it so that when you hit the blue circle when hitting trees etc... You get 1,25 times more materials.

If someone opens a chest it is their loot. You can take anything they may leave behind when done.

2. Again, concerning chests, if someone is breaking through a structure clearly with the aim to get to a chest, or any other loot, let them have it.

3. If a team mate drops an item to use a healing item they found, do not pick up said dropped item while they are healing/sorting inventory. Wait to see if they are planning to pick it back up. Its just basic courtesy.

4. If you down someone on another team away from the main battle action, have the courtesy to finish them off, so they aren't left crawling around for the next minute-and-a-half like a dope.

5. If you see a team mate in need of reviving, and you are clearly in a position to help, revive them!! I think it sould go without saying, but clearly that doesn't seem to be the case. Epic shouldn't have to make it a weekly challenge just to get people to do this. Its like having your parents pay you not to beat up on your younger sibling. If that's what it takes to make you act decent, than you are just a dick.

6. If you see somebody on another team clearly in the middle of completing a challenge, let them finish the challenge before attacking them.

7. This is not such a big deal since the introduction of Soaring 50s, but if your team mate is building a large ramp to use a launch pad, or reach a location of height, don't shoot the damn ramp down. They are on your team for crying out loud.

That's all I can think of now. But feel free to add your thoughts.",FortNiteBR

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here today on Flex Fortnite Commentery we'll have a look at 2 wicked matchups but first, a word from our sponsor.

(after sponsor break)

And now we'll head straight into the first matchup, what's it gonna be Phil?

Here we have Jonesy a defaulty boi, with... a P90.

And here we have John Wick, a highly skilled and professional killer with an astounding body count. He weilds the Heavy Shotgun.

Both 10 metres apart from eachother and both at full shield, OH AND HERE IT GOES! HERE COMES JOHN WITH A SWIFT BUILD AND SHOT AND OH NO 27 DAMAGE! HERE COMES JONESY WITH A QUICK SPRAY AND OMG HE HAS WICK CORNERED! Almost all of Wick's shield is gone but HE CAN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE HERE COMES JONESY BARGING THROUGH WICK'S DEFENCES OOOOOHHHH A HUGE 125 HEADSHOT POINT BLANK BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE JONESY HITS HIM WITH THE OL 1 2 SPRAY AND LANDS A FEW CHEEKY headshots, winning... the match. 

I gotta say Phil this was quite an exhilirating fight you saw here LIVE! Yes Billy quite - the - match.

Now we move on to Duos where both different kinds of Sexeh Ladeh Bombers go up against 2 Sexeh Ladeh Soccer Booties. It's quite a gamble who will win here and here they go but OH..? WHAT'S THIS PHIL??? 2 MORE UNINVITED GUESTS NO WAIT 4? NO BILLY ITS 6 WHOLE OTHER PEOPLE AND IT'S A GANGBANG BUT THE ORIGINAL 4 ARE NOWHERE TO BE SEEN AND ALL THAT is left is a pile of loot, representing lost hope in this matchup.

I apologise in advance for any inconvenience caused for my choice of words below.  

&amp;#x200B;

""GG"" Epic Games. You have now implemented a detection mode in fortnie for mouse / keyboard / controller adapter users on console. 

Do you really think there is an advantage for these users? Good controller players are equally skilled as any m&amp;k adapter user because of the Aim assist. If there was NO Aim assist in the game, I would actually agree with this new ""block"".  It's all about what you are used to play with. I grew up with a mouse and keyboard and I'm not going to switch to a controller all of a sudden. I'm not going to sell my PS4 and buy a PC, and certanly not putting my mouse &amp; keyboard directly in to the console and get matched with PC players. This will be a total slaugther. The mouse acceleration you get is making it impossible to play properly, not to mention the FPS / picture quality advantages the PC users have against a console. 

It seems to me you have not thought this through properly, and you are constantly making poor descisions based on ""shitty players"" whining on forums. I strongly advise you to change the matchmaking back and drop the game kick for adapter use, or you will most definatley get a massive player and revenue loss.

it would be a game mode where whoever gets the most kills wins. Respawns would be on so you could get huge amounts of kills. The game would go for a certain amount of time (e.g 10 mins), and whoever has the most kills at the end would win. This LTM could also work without respawns but I think it would lead to less kills. This game mode could be in solos, duos and squads. 

I believe this would be a good, new, fresh LTM that would lead to some EPIC gameplay. ",FortNiteBR

I‚Äôm not here to vent, and I really don‚Äôt want to cause trouble. But in short I can no longer play fortnite for the foreseeable future due to the recent banning of xim on xbox as you all know.

Due to a recent football injury, I dislocated and both broke my thumb, pinky, and ring fingers on my right hand.

It is not certain if I will be able to make a fist for the rest of my life. Due to this loss of mobility, I cannot hold an xbox controller. I purchased a xim so I can play games with my friends, I‚Äôm not even that good at fortnite but I still enjoy playing greatly.

I also turned off aim assist when I played with xim to make it as fair as possible, but now I can‚Äôt even really look around because I basically only use two fingers on my right hand. I‚Äôm just saying this to show that not everyone who used xim used it as a tool to exploit, and it‚Äôs legitimately needed.

His son, busy farting around the store while his dad asks about v-bucks. 

""So I buy this card for Nintendo and then he can buy the vbucks with this?""

""Yes this is just so he can purchase anything on Nintendo. He would have to specifically buy v-bucks""

""So this isn't v-bucks?"" 

This goes on for 15 minutes. 

Now irritated that this store only has one person helping customers, his son walks up. 

""Dad I need xbox gold as well, excuse me but I don't see any 100 dollar cards for Nintendo here can you print one out for me""

The dad now very confused and unaware of how much money his 12 year old (I'm assuming around there) is about to make him drop starts asking about Black Ops 4.

All in all... I witnessed this kid bamboozle his dad into a $100 Nintendo card, 3 months of xbox live, and paid off Black Ops 4 preorder.

The entire time his dad is muttering ""next time your mom's picking you up""  

Now... I don't know their situation, it's not my place to judge BUT!  In the back of my mind, all I could think was WHAT A SPOILED LITTLE BRAT. 

This kid has no idea the value of a dollar.

When the saleswoman asked ""we have the $100 card to print is that okay?""  

The KID says yes before the dad even said yes.

The other thought that kept racing through my head was, how shitty the gaming industry is now... how shitty this structure of buying skins really is. No one should drop over 200 dollars and walk out of the store with a receipt!!!

When I was a kid. I was lucky if my parents bought me a new game just for the heck of it. If I had to explain to my parents that I need money to buy A COSMETIC ITEM! They would have laughed in my face and said get a job.

 So many things about the entire situation makes me cringe, had to let it out. If no one reads this oh well.

Rant over.

Hello everyone,

I have an i7 8500 with an MX150 graphics card, it runs pretty well. Now, the problem I am having is with fortnite. For no reason at all, my frames will drop from 60-80 down to around 4-8 fps. This is really annoying and pretty much happens during important parts of the match, but it also just happens for no reason at all. The first day this started happening I restarted Fortnite and it fixed. The second day restarting did nothing, I asked my friend and he said it could be because my drivers weren't up to date, he was right, I downloaded them and everything ran smoothly. It is happening again today and I can not figure out what the problem is. No drivers to update, restarting fortnite wont work, restarting my device wont work, I have no idea what is going on? Does any one have a fix for this? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you!

I ended up rushing a guy and doing 36+32 damage and it cost me my life. Ultimately, does anybody else think the shotguns need a SMALL buff that makes it actually a viable thing to use? I sometimes don't even use shotguns due to the fact that sometimes I'll do 100+ damage or 7 using a pump shotgun or 34 or 125+ with a heavy shotgun. Half of the blame is given to how trash my aim can be sometimes but usually I hit most of my shots. This is an over-posted topic, yes but I think it really should be addressed due to the fact that aim is nothing special in Fortnite anymore after the inclusion of the ""Spray Meta"".

A few people may know that the grey/green/blue AR is the M16, the heavy sniper is the Barrett .50 cal, and the grenade launcher is the MK32. So I ventured to try and find the real life counterparts of every other weapon. So far, by observing games such as CSGO and Call of duty, I have determined the following:
Pistol = P250
Suppressed pistol = USP-S
SMG = MP5
Dual pistols = dual berettas. 
LMG = M249(R.I.P. LMG)
Bolt sniper = AWP

However, when I ran into the suppressed AR, I was stuck. Already, everyone was saying that it was a suppressed scar, and I was still a bit lost since the gun was black, not yellow like a normal scar. So I watched some csgo pro matches, and I came across a revelation to a question:
Question: what weapon looks similar to a scar, but is black in color 
Answer: the Galil AR.
So I have a question for everyone: do you think that the suppressed AR is a black colored scar, or is it the Galil AR? ",FortNiteBR

On this day the shop will change every 10 minutes Releasing different skins for a total of 144 changes so if you want a skin you need to be in the right place at the right time.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîRules‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

1.Battle pass/Season shop skins will not appear in this event because they were never sold in the Item shop


2.Skins Will dupe(come in the shop multiple times) so Epic doesn‚Äôt run out of skins to put In the shop 


3.Skin sets will not come out at the same time.   Example-Goal Bound set skins will come out individuals at anytime


4.All skins will not return.Some skins may not return based on complete luck and appearances in the shop 


5.skins will return on appearances in the shop 
Example-Brite bomber has been in the shop 33 times, Flytrap has been in it 3 times, Brite bomber has a higher chance to get in the shop then flytrap.


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-Why?‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
I think this will clear up multiple problems.


1.People wanting skins and those skins never coming back. People might miss the shop and want a skin like Star Spangled trooper it never comes back and then they come to reddit/Twitter to beg for it to come back

2.This STUPID Og trend. Like Cmon I hate how people think that having a rare skin makes u better then everyone else so why can‚Äôt everyone get the same chance to get a skin at the same time. So we can get rid of this trend 

3.Buying and selling accounts. It‚Äôs a major problem. People get scammed for money Everyday and it‚Äôs against epics Code so this would clear up everything and make everyone happy.

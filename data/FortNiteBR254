Ever since Fortnite on the Nintendo Switch came out there has been no career tab. It is very important to me because the only platforms I can play Fortnite on is Switch and Mobile. I have zero ways of seeing my stats, so it’s pretty frustrating. I don’t think it’d be time consuming or hard to add a Career tab to Switch, which can simply be ripped from another version of the game and re-coded and designed for the Switch version. Please, I beg of you to do this, and so do almost all Switch players. We all want the career tab.",FortNiteBR

If Epic games can somehow make a good/fair qualifying system (I think duos should be the focus because it is more entertaining to watch) where the top 100 players from the week are invited to a LAN event for the weekend to compete in a similar format but maybe a few improvements are made to scoring. So for example 6 points for the win, 2 for 2nd and 1 for 3rd and then 2 for 5 kills and 5 for 10 kills. Something like that. It felt bad for teams that came 2nd and at the same time got 4 kills to come away with 0 points. 


Then have all 100 players live stream the event with mics on and 1 official stream like they have now. This will help grow both the tournaments and players at the same time. Because they will both be promoting each other. 


They also need a live leaderboard and also a Live current game leaderboard (so you can quickly see if your team is still in the current game). 


The end of each of these games was so hype where players just started dropping. And the edit battles were amazing to watch along with hearing the communication. 


This will destroy games like Dota/League in terms of entertainment because they just have the one stream and no voice chat of the players to listen to.

Fortnite Summer Skirmish Week 3 Thoughts,"Over the course of the previous two summer skirmishes the community was rightfully angered at server lag, first place winner controversy, and the failure of Epic to create competitive head-to-head gameplay.

However, this week was a step in the right direction.

This week’s format set up competitive play in two ways, first by making a majority of players opt for kills first in order to get points on the board. Second by equating two five kill games to a victory royale. These two factors cause far less camping than on the week one private server and a high level of competitive gameplay from top players such as team liquid.

This week has shown that in kill based scoring, quality of content from a viewers perspective drastically increases. It also has shown that Battle Royale, yes while still primitive in its ability to be an Esport, has the ability to grow with fan support to be successful in the future.

While this week was well done by Epic games, there still can be improvements made.

Firstly on the commentator side: CourageJD and Zeke did a very good job at color commentating. They providing good background information on players and an in-depth knowledge of the game. However, neither were very good on the play-by-play side. CourageJD or Zeke should be kept on as a color-commentator and Epic needs to find a play-by-play analyst in order to improve viewing experience. Also on the commentator side, at many times CourageJD and Zeke were guessing as to how many kills a given team had overall because they could only view the same stats that the viewers could see. Epic should provide everyone with a realtime list on how many kills any given person has.

Secondly on the competitive side: As I have already stated, this format was good for decreasing camping and increasing elimination play. However once a team got 5 kills in order to get the two points, they stopped playing for kills. I believe Epic should have added a second point bonus for 10 kills or a half point for every kill after 5 (just a couple of example) as this would further discourage passive play that we saw occur in the latter half of the competition.

Thirdly and lastly on the player tracking side: One of the main issues that viewers face when watching the main Fortnite stream is that they don’t always know who is and isn’t alive. This wasn’t as big of an issue in competitions such as the E3 Pro-AM where Epic would show the map of where all players are at a given time, but we have yet to see this feature in the Summer Skirmishes yet. In order for viewers to be more entertained and give the commentators more material to build analysis off of, this feature needs to be reintroduced. 

As a whole, we as a community should commend Epic Games for what they did this week. Improvements can still be made, but this was a step in the right direction.

You see, about 6 months ago, EPIC released a poll to discover whether or not people would like or dislike Skill-Based Matchmaking in Fortnite. You guys may or may not remember this, but it was a pretty big thing back then. You were either a 'this will kill the game' person or a 'this will actually help the game' person. The majority of people voted against it. This meant that EPIC couldn't separate the pros from the newbies, and instead had to take a different approach by dumbing down the core mechanics until little Joey could get his first Victory Royale, which leaves people like Ninja and Daequan in the dust. The community was incessant that SBMM would kill the game, but as it turns out it was the refusal to add it to the game that is slowly killing it off today. If we had simply said that we wanted it, none of this would've happened.

Now, I'm not saying that every single enemy in every single game should be at exactly the same skill level as you, that would not be good for a Battle Royale at all, but we need to at least need to think about putting something in place to make it impossible for someone like Nick Eh to be matched with a literal 9 year old who downloaded the game that same day. My thought would be to put in a standard MMR system, but also have around 5 skill tiers in certain MMR ranges that can only get into games with people of that same tier. (e.g if you were tier 3, you can *only* match against other tier 3 players.) Then, EPIC can look at what's being used and what's not being used in each tier individually, and possibly make changes to gameplay in each tier to make it feel balanced for people who play at that tier. (take a shot every time i say 'tier'.) Want to reduce smurfing? People can't drop out of tiers, and MMR would be IP-based. Want less people to boost? MMR averages would be more heavily weighted towards higher tiers. Want to play against noobs? Too bad, guess you have to actually win fights by taking advantage of your own skill. As the community likes to say, just build lol.

Now. What would you guys rather have? The say-goodbye-to-your-build SMG meta we have today, or the say-goodbye-to-noskins concept above?",FortNiteBR

Please, please, let this get attention. The game is currently unplayable for some of us and neither Epic nor the community will even acknowledge it.","On console, there has been a weird lag going on since patch v5.10 released.

When attempting to switch between weapons, oftentimes you will be either unable to switch weapons or it will do so very slowly.  You cannot, say, click “L1” twice to switch to the weapon two slots over.  It does not work.

Every time you go to pick up a weapon by clicking square, the weapon will remain on the ground for about half a second.

Attempting to pull out a trap and/or switch traps is sometimes impossible.

When you are pickaxing an object, the blue circle critical points do not move accordingly when they are hit.  Instead of moving immediately after being hit, they are (unsurprisingly, at this point) delayed by about a half a second.  This leaves you with no time to aim for the next critical point - because, well, you haven’t even hit the first one yet.

And the worst culprit of all - **Building is laggy and doesn’t always work.  This has caused too many deaths.**

Epic, can we please just get a hint of acknowledgement about this?  Its no fun playing a game that lags this badly.

Sadly, with all big video games we run into some dire problems and I believe a Ranked Mode could levitate these problems significantly.  Before I get into this I want to clarify the difference between a **RANKED** mode and S**kill Based Matchmaking**. I am speaking about having a separate mode for people to queue into in order to have a rank determined for them and to move up the Ranked ladder not force every normal match to be at a certain level of play. With that clarified let's begin.

**Epic's balancing for newer/casual players**

Credit to u/Chalizard for bringing this up.

Epic has been nerfing building and introducing more low skill guns into the game to account for so many more new and casual players who simply do not have the time put into the game to defend themselves against the onslaught of dedicated players who can build, position, and shoot way better than these newer players could ever do. I and many others have found ourselves dying to players we frankly should not be dying to and while these can sometimes be obvious misplays on our parts it is mostly due in part to Epic lowering the skill ceiling to compensate for the lack of skill in these casual players. And to be honest, that just isn't fair for the dedicated players and even mid-tier players who have put in the time to get at the level that they're at.

A Ranked mode would help newer players be matched against people of their own skill level and slowly learn and adapt to get better. Paired with the incentive to have their Rank represent how good they currently are. The problem with this is alot of people on this sub seem to believe or are trying to convince other people that smurfing would be rampant in a competitive game mode and while smurfing does indeed happen, it's not as prominent as lot of these people would like you to believe. You're going to notice as I go through this post that most of the arguments against Ranked Mode seems to come out of ill will and not an actual care for the game.

First off smurfing does happen in most competitive games but the majority of the time people don't even smurf to feel better about themselves. As someone who has played League of Legends for 5 years and got to high ranks in Overwatch and Rainbow Six Siege, I am well aware of why people smurf and how prominent it actually is. People typically smurf to play with their lower rank friends or to have multiple accounts already established. I know alot of people including myself have ""smurfed"" before just to prove a point on how to climb up a Rank Ladder.

Secondly many of these games I listed have an anti-smurf system in place. People who are exceeding in the games they play are boosted up faster the ranked ladder until they reach their skill ceiling. So if XxGodSlayerxX makes a new account at a low elo and pubstomps new players, he is propelled through the Ranked Ladder until he gets his ass beat. Another argument to this is that XxGodSlayerxX is just going to make another account and beat new players some more, but if there was a barrier to entry in Fortnite Ranked *lets say for instance a level cap*, then he/she would be less willing to keep making accounts. Not to mention XxGodSlayerxX isn't going to improve and will eventually fall into bad habits of playing with bad players by not versing good players.

**Mid Tier Players are getting blasted by both sides.**

This one is going to be quick because it is pretty simple. Mid-tier players are better than the casual and newer players, but they're dying disproportionately to them because of the changes I stated above. They are also losing to higher-tier and pro-players because they simply haven't advanced to that level of play yet, so despite their abilities they get classified as bad unjustly due to these changes. They can't be differentiated by anything besides a Rank and they can't improve without versing people of their own skill level. Ultimately they're the ones suffering the most despite them having the smallest paragraph in this thread ironically. If you have anything to add to this by all means let me know and I'll add it in.

**Higher Level Players are BORED**

I don't know how to constitute a higher level players, but I am talking about those **HIGHER** level players. I'm talking about the guys with 1000+ wins and 5000+ hours in this game. We've all seen it. These streamers and pro players are bored. They're so bored of stomping casual and average players that the moment playgrounds are released they are already playing Pro-Playgrounds.

Just like with casual players. Pro players will be able to match against people of their own skill level to actually enjoy the game and improve. They can find their place in the sea of high level players. Where would I be placed in Comparison to Myth, Ninja or Tfue? I got around 250 wins. Am I Diamond while they're Challenger? We don't know because we barely even get to see these guys actually try hard until they're versing each other.

Those who are above average, but not ""pro-level"" also want to know where they stand. Unfortunately, there seems to be a sect in this group that are against Ranked mode simply because they believe they have the right to stomp newer players. Honestly that's messed up and I have seen people actively argue on this sub that they want to ""come home from a long day a work and beat kids they're better than."" If you're one of these people, I am sorry but you don't care about this game.

**How do we go about a Ranked Mode?**

Credit to u/eaglessoar for this amazing algorithm (Are you a statistician?)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/921tt3/a\_formula\_to\_determine\_percentile\_rank\_from\_win/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/921tt3/a_formula_to_determine_percentile_rank_from_win/)

Check out this post to see that it can be done if you haven't already. This isn't an algorithm set in stone however I believe it is a fantastic start. I know a BR is more RNG then most competitive games but an algorithm can easily account for that by lessening the blow of elo loss depending on variables like time in the game, K/D, and survivor placement. Many people on this sub seem to think this can only be done using a format that is **Win or Loss**. In games like LoL, OW, Siege, and CSGO you either gain or lose rank depending on if you won or loss. A BR is not that simple so the algorithm can't just be a basic ""Oh you loss but were 3rd place with 15 kills? To bad you lose elo."" No one would be okay with that and I highly doubt any Game Dev would ever even think of that as a viable way to go about a Ranked Mode. People against this Ranked Mode seem to think it will ruin the game, but as u/Chalizard has already said *'if it's bad then they'll just revert it'*.

Another category of people who are against Ranked Mode believe it will ruin the game. People who believe it will ruin the game mistake ruining the game with ruining the game for them. They're against it because it adds an extra level of pressure to play Ranked and compare ranks with other players and their friends. If you fall under this category. I am sorry, social pressure is a pain and if you don't want to play Ranked you shouldn't be shamed for it, but ultimately your value as a player doesn't hinge on your Rank. I wish I had a solution for this I simply don't because this is a social problem society has in everyday life.

On a lighter not though. What people have been forgetting about Ranked Mode is the rank rewards. Skins handed out to certain ranks, prizes for participating in Ranked, and even the top level players get some nice swag like Riot did for League of Legends giving their Challenger players those sexy Jackets. Come on who doesn't want rewards at the end of the season!

Tl;dr- Ranked Mode would be pretty cool and good solution to a few of the problems we're facing currently. Also it would be kinda fun.",FortNiteBR

I'm very tired of having games with kids on iPhones that just camp, it's not even a ""i can't believe he killed me"" I just can't stand having a game and first circle there's 30 people alive. as a game that wants to be competitive the normal mode where there's cheaters, amazing players, very bad players, people just doing challenges, it's boring asf and becomes repetitive, not to mention the annoyance of the end game coming down to whoever has splodes no matter what. 

I wish this game would go back to how it was before, yes double pumping was annoying but heavy smg is even worse because shotguns are insanely inconsistent and the smg damage even after their 'nerf' do a stupid amount of damage to players. I would love to see the skill gap come back bc as of now there is none at all, building was nerfed, shotguns were nerfed and there's bloom on AR so it generally comes down to luck, some skill to hit the crit shots but even then teh damage can still be 7s or 10s. 

It annoys me that now when I get on I kill people who look like they have no limbs and are unable to move and go against players who got lucky and got a minigun and grenade launcher, there isn't any competitive style to this game currently and as someone coming from CSGO from 2013- 2017 and league from 2016-current day a game that has 6 digit tournaments it looks inviting from a competitive standpoint but playing just isn't, spent $50 season 4 when this game was kinda broken but still fun now i'm regretting it and wishing i never spent that as i coulda spent it elsewhere and enjoyed it more. 

TL;DR Why do they keep breaking the game? thoughts on the meta currently being whoever has a spam weapon and no longer who can hit more accurate shots or outbuild?

Last thoughts; I really enjoy this game in the sense that no other game you can build and have fun with it, that part is enjoyable but I really don't want to sit here and my loadout be a shotgun, smg, splodes and heals, i get there's meta in games but where's the fun/skill in using weapons that are extremely op and not only that but very rare, some people get a huge advantage. they should really add a ranking system, yes smurfing is always an issue but it's better to have 1% of the playerbase smurfing than 40% stomping the other 60 who are just playing around having fun or just learing the game",FortNiteBR

The crossbow was one of my favorite weapons. It was a blast in solos getting stealthy kills. It was even more fun trolling friends with it in Squads. But it was my favorite in 50v50, diving into enemy territory, finding a Crossbow if you were lucky enough, and hiding out and eliminating enemies left and right and causing confusion and chaos amongst the enemy team.

Some argue it was a bad weapon, and admittedly it wasn’t the greatest. But it was just plain fun. How could we bring it back?

Well. Infinite ammo with 5 in a clip seemed fine (and adding a new ammo type would probably be tedious). It’s fire rate seemed fine. Not too terribly fast but not too slow either. It’s damage was fine - 75/79, with Epic’s doing 190 headshot damage. Could be toned down a little for the headshot damage, perhaps, so,  say, an enemy squad could have a little more time to try to figure out where the bolt silently soared from. But what really made it stronger than it should be? 

It had a sniper scope.

Imagine a crossbow that essentially acted as a silent Hunting Rifle - rather than a full-on scope, it would have a huge zoom when ADS’ing. It would make the bow a little harder to use, without affecting its mechanics too much. It would feel a little more realistic as well. 

I dunno. I just really loved the crossbow and love the slight stealth element it brought into the game - and seeing it have a niche alongside Suppressed SMGs and Pistols would be fun.

Unfinished and to be updated..

Before reading I would like to state this is unfinished and will be updated upon me getting time.

I had an interest in researching all this for the past 4 days from u/shadukengames. (He was the OP of the moai intersection post.) As curious as everyone else is. I had took it upon myself to research most of what I believe to be the story and conclusion of season 5. ( https://imgur.com/gallery/HQTSb0H thumbnail image)


Please take all of this with a grain of salt. I do not want to come off as crazy. I do not know if I am even on the right trail. Take caution, as I am also only on my phone and, can not make the post look half decent. Their are so many questions that are still unanswered. I am posting my findings as unfinished. As I work 2 jobs, totally 14 hours a day and do not wish to have this continue to take up all of my free time. This is all in hopes of the community to help add more information to this post. If you guys can think of anything significant from previous seasons that corollate with my info. Please do not be frightened to be wrong, this is all a discussion and will be until proven otherwise. 

All of my information is almost directly correlating the themes of this season or partly helping the narrative. 

Their will be a lot of direct links between these different points in time. Their are also some things I am speculating extremely. I will state that info, probably at the bottom of this post. Maybe it makes sense, maybe it doesn’t. 

*Popcorn Emote*

Their are 7 MOAI heads currently in the fortnite map. All of which where found to be facing in one direction near Salty Springs. (found by a reddit user ShadukenGames.)

“These MOAI heads are carved from compressed easily worked volcanic ash or “tuff” found at a single site of the extinct volcano “Rano Raraku”. “

Looking at each MOAI head you can distinctly tell them apart from their facial features to their hats or “puako”. 

“Pukao are the hat-like structures or topknots formerly placed on top of some moai statues on Easter Island. They were all carved from a very light-red volcanic scoria which was quarried from a single source at Puna Pau.”

As from what I can remember.  I have seen some of the moai have a Pukao. I do not know for sure of what is exactly on the heads, as of right now or what they could mean.

From what we know so far these heads are links around the rifts for the most of them that is. Not all rifts spawn directly near moai’s. They spawn near or around areas effected by the crack in the sky. Places that included are the Viking village, sand biome, durr-burger, noms sign, etc. 

To me it seems like this is where mana plays into how + what the rifts are, the storm, drifts pink aura, maybe  the crack in the sky and possibly the pop rocks.

“Many archaeologists suggest that ""[the] statues were thus symbols of authority and power, both religious and political. But they were not only symbols. To the people who erected and used them, they were actual repositories of sacred spirit. Carved stone and wooden objects in ancient Polynesian religions, when properly fashioned and ritually prepared, were believed to be charged by a magical spiritual essence called mana.”

“Mana, in Austronesian languages , means ""power"", ""effectiveness"", and ""prestige"". In most cases, this power is understood to be supernatural.

According to the POLLEX Project, a protoform (an ancestral form of a word) for ""mana""—noted in historical-linguistic convention as *mana-""—existed in Porto-Oceania, the precursor of many Pacific languages. Although the path through the tree from Proto-Oceanic to a specific language is not always clear, the word and concept are thousands of years old. According to linguist Robert Blust, ""mana"" means ""thunder, storm, or wind"" in some languages. Blust hypothesized that the term originally meant ""powerful forces of nature such as thunder and storm winds that were conceived as the expression of an unseen supernatural agency. As Oceanic-speaking peoples spread eastward, the notion of an unseen supernatural agency became detached from the physical forces of nature that had inspired it and assumed a life of its own.""

Could the reason be to unlocking the aura at a high tier, could this coincide with drifts “prestige” and “power”?
Is the storm a supernatural agency?

Going into the moai placement and why they look inland. 

“Archaeologists believe that the statues were a representation of the ancient Polynesians' ancestors. The moai statues face away from the ocean and towards the villages as if to watch over the people. The exception is the seven Ahu Akivi which face out to sea to help travelers find the island. There is a legend that says there were seven men who waited for their king to arrive.”

Why are our seven moai looking inland and not out to sea? Could their be more moai coming in later weeks?
Who is their king?

With talks of a king, mana, and moai history. Some of the story is making sense. You’re right it’s not for the most part.. so far. We know that moai are related to mana, which correlates with the storm, rifts, and drifts aura.

“The quarries in Rano Raraku appear to have been abandoned abruptly, with a litter of stone tools and many completed moai outside the quarry awaiting transport and almost as many incomplete statues still in situ as were installed on ahu. In the nineteenth century, this led to conjecture that the island was the remnant of a sunken continent and that most completed moai were under the sea. That idea has long been debunked.”

A lost continent?

Moving onto where I believe the fortnite map is set and how it was put together. Also of what is to come of the season and it’s end. 

The sunken continent is called “Mu”.

“Mu is the name of a suggested lost continent whose concept and name were proposed by 19th-century traveler and writer Augustus Le Pongeon who claimed that several ancient civilizations, such as those of Egypt and Mesoamerica were created by refugees from Mu—which he located in the Atlantic Ocean. This concept was popularized and expanded by James Churchward, who asserted that Mu was once located in the Pacific.”

This is where I first found the first mentioning of Egypt. 

“The mythical idea of Mu first appeared in the works of Augustus Le Plongeon (1825–1908), after his investigations of the Maya ruins in Yucatán. He claimed that he had translated ancient Mayan writings which supposedly showed that the Maya civilization of the Yucatán was older than those of Greece and Egypt, and told the story of an even older continent.

This is also where I began to think if this continent is older than Greece and Egypt. Would they have been settled by descendants of this land?Both of which to me are most notable “worlds” that are apart of this season.

Le Plongeon actually got the name ""Mu"" from Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, who in 1864 mistranslated what was then called the Troano Codex using the de Landa alphabet. Brasseur believed that a word which he read as Mu referred to a land which had been submerged by a catastrophe. Le Plongeon then identified this lost land with Atlantis. and turned it into a continent which had supposedly sunk into the Atlantic Ocean.” .....

Atlantis! The maps sinking?

“Le Plongeon claimed that the civilization of ancient Egypt was founded by Queen Moo, a refugee from the land's demise. Other refugees supposedly fled to Central America and became the Maya.”

“Churchward claimed that Mu was the common origin of the great civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Central America, India, Burma and others, including Easter Island, and was in particular the source of ancient megalithic architecture. As evidence for his claims, he pointed to symbols from throughout the world, in which he saw common themes of birds, the relation of the Earth and the sky, and especially the Sun. Churchward claims that the king of Mu was named Ra and he relates this to the Egyptian god of the sun, Ra.”

Going back to the 7 moai waiting for a king, is Ra the king? Possibly being our road trip skin? This would further connect Egypt to mu, to Ra.

“Churchward attributed all megalithic art in Polynesia to the people of Mu. He claimed that symbols of the sun are found ""depicted on stones of Polynesian ruins"", such as the stone hats (pukao) on top of the giant moai statues of Easter Island. Citing W.J. Johnson, Churchward describes the cylindrical hats as ""spheres"" that ""seem to show red in the distance"", and asserts that they “represent the Sun as Ra.”

Further connecting Ra to the Moai and their Pukao’s.



 Extreme speculation

Pointing out where the Viking village is at. It’s is located at the tallest peak on the map. Reading into Norse Language, I had came across the word snaefell. 

“Snaefell (Old Norse, snjœ-fjall/snjó-fall - snow mountain) - (Manx: Sniaull)[1] is the highest mountain and the only summit higher than 2,000 feet (610 m) on the Isle of Man, at 2,037 feet (620.9 m) above sea level.”

https://imgur.com/gallery/z3agk1H
If you corrolate the Isle of Man and the location of snaefell with the fortnite map. It almost lines up perfect with the edge of the island and where the mountain is. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/hjNsIeG
I am willing to believe that a volcano May in fact becoming to the map as well. As this is the extreme speculation I was mentioning above. I can’t remember the OP of the volcano concept, but it may be true. Looking at the geographical map of the Easter Island. Lining it up with the NW corner of the map, it almost fits perfectly. This island also being home to the moai. It has a volcano that would be near junk junction and now mysteriously vanished soccer field.

https://imgur.com/gallery/UkXLbdS
As these are not direct interpretations. The map of mu and Atlantis are both of the same origin. I have no idea if our map is modeled after either of these. It really seems like it is and I don’t know how with all the evidence so far points to this.

I would also like to point out the pot
Of gold(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifröst) and Ragnarök. They are the  97th and 100th battle pass tier rewards. As these are both references to Greek and Norse Mythology.

“During the Ptolemaic Period Anubis became associated with the Greek god Hermes as the composite god Hermanubis. Hermes was messenger of the gods, while Anubis was principally guide of the dead. Hermanubis was some times given attributes of Harpokrates. He was worshipped in Rome until the second century and was popular with Rennaisance alchemists and philosophers.

Priests wore Anubis masks during mummification. However, it is not clear whether the Anubis mask was a later development influenced by the Osirian myth or whether this practice was commonplace in the earlier periods too”

They're specifically targeting the competitive side of the game with all of the recent additions and updates. 

We saw in the first Summer Skirmish that there was many players left in the last few circles, and they were all there, just sitting in their 1x1s. Epic isn't trying to nerf building in itself, they're trying to reduce turtling, making the games in competitive scenes shorter, and more entertaining 

EXAMPLE 1: The opaque editing squares. This essentially nerfs ""pencil warriors"" very hard, and makes it way more difficult to feel comfortable with camping.

EXAMPLE 2: The addition of the P90, and the other SMG buffs. In my opinion, this was to make it harder to just sit in your base and spam walls when you were getting shot at. This unintentionally fucked up ramp rushing and build battles. I don't believe that Epic's intentions were to kill building, I really believe that they know what they're doing.

EXAMPLE 3: Zone centering outside of circle for 8, 9, and 10th circles. This was, again, making sure people can't just sit in the middle of the zone, spam walls, and end it in a healing battle.

I do agree that these changes also (imo unintentionally, but who knows) nerfed building, and the SMG changes were bad, but I really think that Epic has a direction they're trying to lead the competitive scene. The SMG changes did lower the skill gap for sure, but I do believe that Epic will pull it back.

\*\*TL;DR: Changes were made, not to cater to casuals, but to make the competitive scene more interesting to watch, and less campy.\*\*",FortNiteBR

Users on many different sites have all made the same, simple, solution, although nothing has been done to amend this mistake. Despite the developer's efforts to provide a smooth experience for free-to-play players and players who buy skins, many of us controller users are disregarded in favour of ""providing an accessible playing field for all users""- which, quite frankly, is totally nonsensical if controller players are punished for an external decision made by another player.

For those who are unaware or new to the game, players who use a keyboard and mouse are being placed in the same matches as players with controllers.

Yes, that's right. All of you inexperienced, new players are being unfairly matched with players who are at an advantage using a keyboard and a mouse. 

I believe this has to change as many of us are losing games AS SOON AS WE LAND and also during 1v1 situations and even 1v1v1 situations towards the end of the game.  

It's a simple theory really, and pretty much many players agree on this solution; all Kb+m players on console get placed with players on PC. This solution is undoubtedly the best, and many other players agree with this situation- much yet have suggeted this idea themselves `many times already`.

On the proposed system:

When comparing the hardware of a console user with a kb+m, versus the hardware of a PC player (with a kb+m) there is no difference- both sides are able to play on an `EQUAL` playing field and no other player is punished, unless the PC player intentionally uses a controller, which is much harder to use when it comes to building and aiming. Console players with a controller continue to play against their all-controller opponents, which is completely equal for those players as well. However, this equal playing ground can only be possible if keyboard users are in their own, individual matches and controller users have their own, individual matches

On the current system:

Console users with a keyboard are against the usual console players, who use controllers. This is unjust; the mouse provides a more accurate medium to aim and the keyboard provides a highly versatile medium (with extra possible inputs) in order to build. PC players supposedly play with mobile users, but if this is simply a running theme, then tell me and I will gladly delete this small section. Not only that, though, but PC players can use macros in order to make quick escapes, in certain sticky situations. There was an old video where someone shot down a skybase and the opponent falling down was able to quickly place a floor then a jump pad, allowing themselves to survive being punished for using a risky technique. This highlights that, whether or not a macro was proven to have been used in that situation, players can still make a comeback from a fall from incredible heights.

In summary, I completely love this game. Fortnite has tremendously exceeded many other Battle Royale genres, including, but not limited to, PUBG- which has been neglected the same attention that Epic gives to Fortnite. On the other hand, there are many issues with this game, as with any other, that still need addressing, such as ~£20 skins (albeit, we don't have to buy them, but still expensive considering I could buy a moderately large DLC for the same price, or even cheaper in another game), uneven matchmaking (the main point of this post) unbalanced weapons (which have been recently balanced, although all weapons can finish a player in less than two seconds and, on console, an unfinished or bugged building &amp; editing system which has taken several updates to slowly upgrade (holding to edit is not perfect, sometimes building refuses to work and a bug where only the active building peice type can be edited for placed buildings is still dominant).

I hope that, for the audience who has read through the whole post, you can understand what I mean and why I think the game still needs some drastic changes. To repeat, I love this game, but I hope it can improve more overtime and do more great things.",FortNiteBR

I made  this concept as part of an application to work at Epic Games a couple  of weeks ago. As they have not gotten back to me and their email stated  that if I didn't hear from them in a couple of weeks then they have  decided not to consider me, I figured it would be a shame if I didn't at  least get some feedback for the idea. Please let me know what you think  and if you would actually use this feature if it was in the game.

**Goal of Project:**  increase the utility of the playground mode by eliminating the busy  work involved in finding weapons, materials, and ammo. The Gold  inventory will allow players to utilize the benefits of the mode  immediately, encouraging repeat uses of the playground as tedium is kept  to a minimum.

**Gold Inventory:**  A second inventory exclusive to the playground mode. It is placed to  the left of what the current inventory, which will be referred to as the  active inventory. The Gold inventory contains an infinite amount of all  traps, all materials, and all weapons (including their tiers). Players  can then choose what they want to bring into their active inventory  simply by opening their inventory as normal and dragging and dropping  from the Gold inventory to the active inventory. This eliminates the  need to scour the map trying to find the one weapon that players want to  test, the need to scavenge materials to build, and the general downtime  of resupplying after death in playground mode. Additionally, with the  inclusion of this second inventory, new exclusive items can be added to  playground mode without needed to have them drop on the map or put them  in the RNG chest calculations. Items could include target dummies for  sniper target practice and rails/target dummy movement options.

**Who it benefits**

**Content producers:**  Easier for content producers to make their videos and therefore brings  more attention to Fortnite via social media outlets. A genre of Fortnite  record breaking content has begun to develop on YouTube. An example of  this working already is the YouTube channel *Muselk*.  His video “Building The WORLDS BIGGEST PYRAMID In Fortnite Battle  Royale!” has reached nearly 1.5 million views in two days. Encouraging  content producers to make more content like this by easing their  production with this tool would bring more attention to the game.

**Competitive players (E-Sports players):**  a massive amount of money has been spent on developing an E-Sports  scene, this mode could elevate the skill of pro players by allowing for  easy set up of fighting situations, however the current mode makes it a  bit trivial for setting up 1v1 or 2v2 as all players need to find  similar weapons for the scenarios they practice in as well as the ammo  involved for each weapon. This could increase their skill and bring more hype to esports. Hardcore players (Non-Esport player), will be able to  enjoy this tool in the same manner as their E-Sport counterpart as their  drive for playing is similar.

**Casual players:**  get to easily try the new weapons in a no pressure environment and  having instant access to the new weapon will encourage logins on patch  day and increase exposure to daily shop options. Therefore, increasing  visibility of paid cosmetic options. Additionally, these players are  more likely to use the mode to build large and complex structures that  they would then be likely to share over social media, further increasing  exposure to the game.",FortNiteBR

So for anyone who’s unaware of what I’m talking about, you’ll be able to unlock Stage 5 Drift and Stage 5 Ragnarok after Season 5 is over.

I personally think this is complete bullshit. The purpose of these challenges is to play the game and grind during the season so that you can earn something that not everyone will be able to get. The grind for level 80 last season was rough, but I got to level 80 and I felt accomplished for unlocking something that a majority of players wouldn’t get and will never be able to get again.

Now there’s no reason to grind, you can casually play this game clear into season 10 and still unlock Stage 5 Drift and Ragnarok. All Epic cares about now is making this game more accommodating for casual players, so they’re going to reward them for casually playing the game and basically saying “fuck you” to the players who spend hundreds of hours grinding to make sure they unlock everything in the Battle Pass.

Donation Question:
&gt;Ninja are you buying Drake's Scorpion jacket and new album? You can get your name stitched on the back also pretty dope.

Ninja's response:

&gt;Uhhhhm I... you know is he going to buy my next line of ninja merch? or my ninja headband? probably not. I feel like Drake saw I was up and coming into the gaming scene and he thought it would be a perfect way to tap into another source of viewers by playing with me. He also may have wanted to game, I'm not sure. But he's a genius dude. I'd love to buy it but then I'd feel very fanny... which I am! HA! So yes I will be buying the jacket is basically what I am trying to say. 

This was from his July 3rd Live stream and 24 days later we hear Drake unfollowed Ninja.  From the full context it just seems like he's got some truth behind his comment and some joke in there as well. He's going to be a fan of Drake and love his music but he doesn't need Drake as a follower on his Twitch channel. This whole controversy just reeks of yellow journalism.

I don't think it's for protection, as I will see them do it at times where it would be way more cost effective to just jump and build a ramp to get to the next level.  But I see a lot of people will look down and quickly place a floor right before they place the ramp.

I understand why you would want to build a floor under your ramp when doing a ramp/wall/floor push...but this isn't what i'm talking about.  I'm talking about when they aren't starting out with a ramp, but instead put 2 walls at the end of the ramp to jump up one level and change direction of their build.

[Take a look at this video from tfue for example](https://youtu.be/9JPGAkIu3bU?t=10m).  Slow it down to .25 speed because he goes too fast to really see.  But you'll notice he's chasing this guy and he's placing a ton of floors when he could just be placing ramps.  Unless the only reason is that it provides extra protection.  But I thought maybe with how the phasing works - maybe the floor actually gives you a bit more height to more successfully clear the jump and not get caught under your ramp?

Is there any validity to this idea? Or is really the only purpose here to make the build more sturdy?",FortNiteBR

Now that left stick is no longer technically needed (I will gladly sacrifice the ability to walk) I think it would be very beneficial to have left stick be your inventory slot number one (Toggle on/off) and the only way to get to this weapon/item is by clicking the left stick.  This would also have the option to reset (toggle on/off) to the weapon you had out before selecting your slot one weapon with left stick.  

This sounds confusing so let me break this down for you guys.  For these examples left stick is always going to be AR just to keep things simple but you could put whatever weapon/item in the first slot based on your personal preferences!

-I have my shotgun out and I select my AR with left stick.  Now in order to get back to my shotgun I press either RB/LB.
-I have my sniper out and I decide to build.  While in my build menu I could then switch straight to my AR with left stick and bypass pressing B/O to close my builds and then having to cycle to my sniper.
-Again beginning with my shotgun.  I select my AR with left stick and then decide to build.  Upon leaving build mode my weapon slot resets back to my shotgun.

LB/RB would now cycle the remaining four inventory slots (2-5) allowing us to never have to cycle more then two slots at a time.  The only way to get to inventory slot one would be by pressing left stick!

I know some of you would prefer to have tap to edit on left stick and obviously fully customizable layouts would be much better but who knows when that day will come...  This reset weapon system could be very helpful once that day does finally come.  Allowing us to bind specific weapon slots to buttons and then being able to cycle the remaining slots with either LB/RB (or even Left/Right DPad which would then free up your bumpers) would be so helpful!

Let me know what you guys think or if there are any ways I could improve this post!

Maybe if everyone wasn’t demanding new suggestions all the time EPIC would have time to actually fix the things currently wrong with the game. Instead of trying to please every one by adding these new suggestions it’s just breaking the game more. Take the P90 for example that gun was requested more than 100 times in the past few months. And now that it’s here it is by far the most complained about gun. Stop making new suggestions that are pointless and dont benefit anyone or anything.

1: Why is bloom in this game, look it doesnt even need to be very controllable recoil patterns, but if one player can hit all their shots and the other can't based on luck. This game shouldn't have a MODE where you can earn IN GAME MONEY

2: When more people are learning how to build, they are not increasing materials. It feels like I am running out of materials early game when I used to not be able to, I literally now have to farm trees, when I used to just be able to mine 1-2 pallets, and I would have enough to kill someone, which would profit me in resources

3: when SMG's have the highest dps in the game, they now make them way more common by making more of them, great choice

4: Now that double shotgun is gone (I'm glad for that) Now the pump is basically useless because they haven't changed it

5: The longer you play Fortnite, the more you die to people in top 10 that have no kills but manage to have better loot then you (In a game where you have like 5 kills) I legit had 11 kills, had a huge base. Someone was hiding under it with an RPG and he managed to win because I couldn't fight back, he had more shields then I've even found in the game, and he had better weapons.

I think mostly the fact that the more you play the more luck based you see it as, and the fact that they are trying to appeal to whoever they can get into the game to increase player count

Examples of this

1: Port a fort

2: Nerfed materials in Blitz

3: more SMG's (Easiest guns in the game to use)

I've been getting really tired of the game ever since mid season 4. I'd say the changes the game needs to have are

1: Make recoil patterns, I don't care if its post season 3 h1z1 where they were basically impossible to learn, rather

A: make them so innaccurate after a few shots, that at least it wont be luck based whether or not you can pop off another shot, or if it bounces off the radar

B: Make a more CSGO-type Gun sprays slightly up

 I'd prefer A to be honest as it wouldn't switch the game too much

Make some guns airdrop only

one of the best ways to draw in people in battle royale games (PUBG's a good example) Is to lure in people with sweet unique guns (Like the AWM) I'd say the only guns that need to be airdrop only are 

1: Scars, look I don't have a problem with them, but nobody goes for airdrops, and the fact that you can get a gun so easy to hit shots with seems a bit unfair, because its just by luck

2: RPG's Enough said, I don't have a problem with them mid game, but I've died to enough players who can barely move their mouse but can one shot me, well I've looted 2/3 of the same house and manage to not have a single gun. Just make them airdrop only!

3: (Buff the minigun) I'd say the best gun to make it similar to would be the GTA 5 minigun, where it does stupid high dps and is pretty accurate, Its a very unused gun so a buff like this would make the game good

Also a few other things I've noticed degrade as the game goes

1: People are so hard to finish in this game, Like I've shot people point blank and it does no damage, there's like a 1 second delay between downing and finishing, it should be removed because it slows the game down and literally makes no sense

2: Give people a bit less health when downed, you can tank a semi auto shot well downed, a hunting rifle shot, a shotgun shot, Make it like 75

Also some changes I think need to be made to rarities

1: Minishields need to be common, It's really unfair to die to someone because they have more shields then me, It happens about 1/4 of my deaths, it could be like the PUBG helmet/vest thing, You get like 35% more protection but helmets/vests are really common

2: Spawn another lamba or two on the map, they are not common enough, especially considering the major nerf to them

Also, if you think I'm a noob, I havent played much season 5 but so far

my kd is about 2

and I have 2 wins in about 15 matches

And in season 4, my kd was like 1.7 and I have about 300 matches with 15ish wins.

Also, if you're just going to downvote me, TELL ME WHY I AM WRONG, also I can debunk a bunch of common points right now

1: First shot accuracy, 

You are risking your life by staying still to use it, I've been sniped and sniped people well they are staying still to shoot me

2: Learn-To-Build (Explosives argument)

I'm talking mostly early game, and anyways you can annihilate things late game, OP in my opinion

3: Go back to PUBG or CSGO (Yes I've heard people accuse me of being a CSGO fanboy and have been told to go back)

Bloom is a bs mechanic that does not belong in any game with guns, and I don't know how Fortnite dodged the hate with that, just make recoil patterns, I don't care if you can't learn them. Make 2 people shoot with terrible recoil

4: Farming rates are fine, why are people complaining suddenly:

More people know how to build, so when you kill someone you don't get as many materials

I hope you guys are actually willing to try to debunk my post, and not just call me a noob.

hopefully you do both,

Also, I don't know why solo showdown exists in a game with such luck based mechanics. This will be a big problem in the higher ranks/scores",FortNiteBR

I just feel like traps are so lame man...there is not reason why someone should be able to frantic spam traps in build situations. There has been too many times where I outplay someone and they just literally spam traps on a wall and kill me. Its not skillful, IMO, not a sick play, or nothing. There shouldn't be a reason that someone can just literally go into a fight with the intention of trapping someone and get away with it. Heres what I think should happen.

1. **Traps vaulted** (They do waaaay too much damage for them to be able to be so easy to find and placed anywhere.)
2. **Enable friendly fire** ( If someone does decide to spam traps, they should take damage too. No reason someone should be able to trap BOTH you and him and without ANY consequence. 
3. **Enable a set time** ( Its a TRAP for a reason, if someone decides to place one, at least have a 2 second set time for them. 
4. **Draw back the damage**( I dont think there will be a time where someone ALWAYS has over 150 health in the game. I mean at least let them do maybe 100 damage instead of 150. 

Me personally, I would prefer a set time and friendly fire if they are to stay in the game. They are really getting out of hand man. Or just vault these things. People are using them incorrectly and getting away with it. 

Feel free to share your opinions as well. I would love to see if anyone feels the way I do or similar, or just flat out disagrees.

How is keybinding on the XIM? I thought I had seen that it isn’t exactly like PC and there are limitations with it.

The DBNO mechanic is a great one and allows players a second chance after making a mistake or simply being on the wrong end of AR RNG, but IMHO it could use a few tweaks.  

The issue: Teams with less skill and talent can ruin a better team's shot at a VR by thirsting one or more teammates in a battle they ultimately lose.

The resolution: A knocked player drops the weapon they were using and half of their mats but cannot be killed by the opposing team (their health does tick down on the timer, same as the current system - this timer could possibly even be shortened).  This still means that opposing players are still rewarded with loot from a dropped foe but the winning team can revive downed allies.

resolution version 2:  keep DBNO system the same but let knocked players build.

Is this a petty gripe? perhaps.  Am I just salty from getting thirsted over and over and over?  almost definitely.  But seeing this system get an overhaul that results in a more strategic team vs. team fight interests me.  I'd love to hear your thoughts.",FortNiteBR

When someone posted that Ragnorok should get colors EPIC replied with ""What should you guys do to earn it.""  basically.

I have played since season one and getting 80 last season did not feel like a grind, I was just playing a game I love,  if you don't want to play to 80 who cares if you don't get the full skin you didn't want it enough, because it wasn't that hard I ended up getting it 18 days early with a full time job and a holiday in between.

Originally the first solo showdown promoted and rewarded winning games, and this inadvertently promoted camping and safe play. However, in v2 points are rewarded for the win but also the kills. 

The scoring system works like this:

-100 points for a win (Position 1) 
-These points then go down 2 at a time (e.g. 98 for 2nd place, 96 for 3rd) continuously until 75th place. 
-75-100 place gives 25 points, to reward participating in every match. 
-6 points per kill

Obviously this system rewards kills just as much as a win and in assuming that to get a prize your going to need to win most games and win (or get top 5 or so) every game.

Every single gun class has been part of some kind of meta at one time or another. Except for one. Pistols. Pistols are honestly the most worthless items in BR currently. Sure, it’s fun to mess around with dualies, revolvers and deagles, but they aren’t used as actual weapons by the very vast majority of the community. They are completely obsolete. However if they were buffed, this could turn around. I saw another post on reddit the other day which outlined how the pistol class could be buffed, like deagles and revolvers having no damage drop off, deagles one shotting for a headshot, dualies damage being buffed to fifty, and suppressed and normal pistols doing over 30 damage for a body shot. Please epic, it makes SENSE!

TL:DR: Pistols have become obsolete and cannot keep up with the current meta, so they could be buffed in certain ways to help them remain usable.",FortNiteBR

Why are these awful decisions being made? 

They innovate a game and add a crazy concept of building and this is by far what separated the br from all the other carbon clones of pubg. The mechanics felt great but suddenly we have this smg spam and getting lazered through our structures. It's not fun. I enjoyed the shotgun meta far more than what we have now. The nerf was nowhere near strong enough and the wood structure changes should be reverted. 

I just don't get it. The game in its current state causes depression. You build a game on a unique concept then shit on the same concept because it had a skill gap. If I could get a refund for the money I've spent on this game I'd run with it. ",FortNiteBR

Shotguns are basically useless against the onslaught of 1000 smg bullets in half a second aimed at every direction of your body.

Grenade radius is terrible too, RPGS and grenade launchers are even more difficult to defend against with this update and they were bad enough as it was.

T was hoping they could do the same for me so like me and many of my friends we kinda a feeling fortnite is getting a bit stale for us at the moment so we switched games(Destiny 2)

Every day i would login into PvE for the daily login and PvP(maybe occlusally play a few games a day) to check and post reset in our group(i was that guy) and if something had interest us we would jump on.

What happened today just baffes me i go to sign into epic games to login to the game when im hit with a message "" Sorry, your account is inactive and may not login."" and i was shocked because i didn't know what that meant so after a quick brief search on google before i left for work the message basically meant from what i gathered from reddit post and froum post was that i was banned but no reason and the whole time in my head at work(6 hour shift) was basically why was a banned(i was shocked as well) i havent done anything wrong to my knowledge that should have lead to being banned i can't even search my stats on fortnite tracker which is just sad to me that epic bans people and basically removes every trace of their account.

There is only one instance that i can think of that might have gotten me banned and that is [this](https://imgur.com/BoQ9NEw) what happened night/morning is i logged into fortnite and i saw that i had [16,600 vbucks](https://imgur.com/rXRtFf9) and nothing from my bank has been charged so being as hyped as everyone else in my team i bought 4 items(Gumshoe,Magnifying glass pickaxe,Snoop Dogg emote, and i think Pure emote"") me and squad went to sleep after that then in the morning i got two emails that i have pointed at the the image above ^ saying that i have been refunded(with someone else's card and name that i didn't recognize ) and then i was like WTF did i get hacked so i quickly jumped on fortnite in the morning and saw that i have been refunded x amount of vbucks and the 4 items that i bought and i went to my refunds in the game settings i still had 3 left but after the refunding it now says -1 out of 3(like WTF) i think i was going to contact epic at some point but i got busy with work and helping family and must have forgot and pretty much thought nothing of it because since i didn't get said vbucks and said money was refunded that nothing was wrong but i did change my password and enable 2fa so that if someone did try to login i would at least get notified by email or something.

So i thought that posting here by some chance epic sees that and helps me i would be very gratefully i have supported fortnite for the longest time i played through season 1,2(half way through battle pass),3(tier 100),4(tier 100 and lvl 80), and season 5 oh boy i spent money on tiers to get to tier 70 when the season started so i can worry less about the grind and grind destiny 2 smart and dumb decision, also to add on to that i have spent 600+ NZD(New Zealand Dollar) on this game already and how is it fair that i can't play due to my account being compromised and this scumbag buying then refunding it(thats what i think at least) i mean in all honestly that might not even be the reason why i got banned but its the best i can think of 


enough with rambing hope you enjoy your season boys/girls if i can't get my acc i would be very disappointed and down that all this money i spent just disappeared, And epic i hope you see this post and are able to help me and probably others going through the same situation,

TL;DR: Account got banned, dont know why think it might have something to do with someone logging into my acc and buying vbucks and refunding it to get me banned.

Side note: also i have bank statements of every purchase i made to epic games and nothing was wrong in that department.",FortNiteBR

But my question is why is epic forcing down certain meta's trough our throats?  
I mean right now you HAVE to pick up a SMG since double pumping isnt working and smg is so strong.  
Why not let us choose? Like bring double pumping back with the dmg shotguns have now. But also keep the smg's like this. So people can choose what to play , a double pumping guy would only stand a chance against a smg player if he builds correctly. Double pumping can be countered by blocking shots with walls etc. So it isnt that bad.

  
New/casual players could pick up smg's because its easier to handle and the more experienced players could double pump. I dont think if you bring it back now the double pump would dominate the scene since smg's are really good now aswell. And please dont see me as that double pumping fanboy because i wasnt a fan of the 1 shotting either. But after the nerf there was nothing wrong with it in my opinion. 

My point is let us choose what to play and don't force certain meta's down our throat.

TL;dr : Let us choose what to play and dont force smg's down our throat. Bring double pumping back for experienced people and let smg's stay the way they are.",FortNiteBR

The Switch community is pretty tiny on this subreddit and we don't even know if Epic is working on fixing the mess, or if they're even aware of it.

Long story short: Ever since 5.0, the Switch version can be summed up by :

* Massive FPS drop pretty much any time during the game but especially in the early game when there are the most players alive
* 1 to 2 seconds freezes when landing in ""crowded"" areas (And by crowded I'm talkin Salty, not even Tilted which is unplayable)
* Textures taking like 5 seconds to load (I did put all the game data on the console's drive instead of the SD card, didn't change anything)
* A new one since 5.1 patch : Voicechat is lagging so hard you can't even understand your teammate. It's not a network issue I'm usually on 15ms and the voicechat works fine in the pre-game lobby, it just becomes irrelevant in-game.

Every single one of these issues wasn't in the game before S5. Hopefully some fellow Switch owners can comment and tell me if they have the same issues but I'm pretty sure we all do. Hopefully Epic is aware of it.

I have some very helpful tips and tricks for everyone to benefit from and if you have any additional tricks, feel free to comment below. 

1. Do **NOT** land in busy areas e.g. Tilted Towers, Paradise Palms, etc.

* Reason for rule number 1 is because on average, to come even close to qualifying in the top 100 you will need to be placed at-least top 10 in all 25 games. The previous Solo Showdown also rewards points for eliminations however this should not be your main concern as getting to top 10 should give you kills along the way including the kills during the final top 10. If you die before top 50 or higher in any of the 25 games more than *ONCE* then I strongly recommend you reconsider **Rule 1** and aim for busy areas in-order to get the most eliminations possible **(6 points per elimination is rewarded).** 

2.  Have a notepad or a form of keeping track of your **placement** and **kills**.

* This is if not, one of the most important rules you should follow before starting your Solo Showdown due to there not being any current form of tracker (this may change in this Solo Showdown). Ensure you write down the placement and kills for each of the 25 games you play to remember how many games you have left to play; and to know if you need to try harder and go for kills to boost your overall score. 
* To work out your score, use a calculator and add up the score for your placement matching the table on the Fortnite Rules. [(A list of the score for each placement can be found here)](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/solo-showdown-official-contest-rules-july). After you have added your placement score, write it down and you can now add up the total kills you managed in all 25 games. Multiply the total kills you achieved by 6 and add that score with your **total placement score** and **divide by 25** which should now give you an average score which can then be compared to the table found in the link previously to generate which placement you averaged.

3.  Have a **game plan**.

* The main reason for people dying at the start is due to them **not knowing where to land** which will usually result in them having an early death and discontinuing any chance of them placing in the top 100. Before you play any of these 25 matches, **work out a strategy on where you will land;** I normally pick two or three spots depending on the bus route.
* Work out what **loadout** you will use during the game. Using a sniper is effective however it will be hard to snipe someone on Solo Showdown due to them not being as easy of a target like an ordinary solo match which should make you question whether it is worth taking up a whole slot for something you might not necessary need. What works for me might not work for others however I do suggest you use what you are comfortable with and **ensure** you carry **some form of explosives** at all times e.g. RPG, Grenade Launcher, Clinger, Grenade, Remote Explosives, etc.

4.  **Always** harvest material.

* Plain and simple, if you run out of materials - **you will die.** 
* Always harvest material whenever you can due to building being such an important factor in Solo Showdown. You will need a **minimum of 600 material** combined if you are to stand any chance of surviving. Whoever has the most material usually tends to win the fight because keeping high-ground on your opponent is crucial. By the time you kill an opponent, they will usually have used up all their materials so harvesting material throughout the game is very important.

5.  Choose your **Outfit** and **Back Bling** carefully.

* Choosing your outfit and back bling is extremely important for two main reasons. The **first** reason is it can give you a huge disadvantage if you have a very bright or big character which can been seen very easily; this can also be an advantage for confident players due to players being more inclined to notice you and take a shot at you, allowing you to find the player and eliminate them. 
* The **second** reason is you will be at a major disadvantage if you have a back bling equipped as following one of the recent updated to 'ghost peaking', your back-bling or even characters outfit such as the Cuddle Team Leader can obstruct your view and make it harder to ADS with certain guns. Having a back-bling is not worth using at all during this tournament so remove or use a smaller back bling unlike the 'Love Wings'.

6.  Goodluck

* This tournament will be **very difficult** compared to the previous Solo Showdowns due to the top 100 players being able to compete in the future Summer Skirmish, so if you can not handle a challenge I recommend not going for this or at-least play for fun or practise on getting better for future games and tournaments. 
* Console users will be at a huge disadvantage due to players from PC most definitely going to use keyboard and mouse on console for an upper-advantage but this should **not** discourage you.
* Final tip is to **not panic**. If you panic you will most likely die due to being distracted and not focused. If you do die however and you are not happy with the placement you achieved then do not be angry and take a break from playing because if you play stressed or angry then believe me it won't help and you'll not be focused. 

I hope you guys managed to read to the end and I hope this helps, I will be uploading my highlights of the 25 games on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/arbroathsfinest) if you guys want to check that out!

Out of the 5 or 6 skins that come out only 1 or 2 are still used in the seasons after. How many Rust Lords have you seen running around. What about Valor? Elite Agents? I'm willing to bet you don't see too many of these skins running around anymore. Fortnite gets so many new players every season who will never get a chance to get these skins who almost never get used even though a large portion of the playerbase still has them. Why not put them in the shop every once in a while for those who started playing after that specific season. My friend has loved the Elite Agent skin every since she started playing (beginning of S4) and will never be able to get that skin even though it's her favorite. I'm sure theres plenty of other people out there who are in a similar situation. Would you guys be against bringing these battlepass skins into the shop?

I would love to see the addition of more centralized US servers. Currently all we have is East and West. Granted ping isn't too terrible connecting to either with sub 100 on East and usually sub 70 on West. However, this game relies heavily on the connection you have in response to building and editing, so I would like to see servers possibly in the following areas;

Chicago

Denver

Austin

These 3 locations are usually popular server locations for either games or private servers for the population that more center of the US.

Thoughts?

As we all know. The Compact SMG just got a massive nerf. EPIC made the gun significantly less effective in literally every way possible. It is less accurate and does less damage with more damage dropoff and a lower fire rate than at launch. This wasn't EPIC caving to community pressure. This isn't a ""Eh, I guess you're right; we could tone it down just a little"" type of nerf. The fact that this nerf was so massive and so quick should indicate to everyone that it was always part of the plan.

Think about it: EPIC is constantly releasing new guns into the game, some of which are redundant and/or useless, just to add some intrigue to the game. It gives the YouTubers / streamers some easy content, which buys Fortnite a ton of free publicity. So now EPIC releases an intentionally overpowered gun into the game. Streamers go crazy about it, the entire community is abuzz about it; it's exciting and it's good for business. Then, before people get too mad about the balance of the game, EPIC gets to come to the rescue, quickly nerfing the gun that they intentionally made way too good, and getting more positive publicity for ""responding to community feedback.""

There is no way that such a massive nerf would come so quickly as a result of an honest miscalculation. EPIC knew exactly what they were doing all along. Wake up, sheeple.",FortNiteBR

As a madden head it was new to me but I enjoyed playing. I have not been able  to play much due to a busy schedule but when I have time I game as much as I can.

I’m finally to the point where I can get 4-6 kills consistently and make the top 3 regularly. Admittedly I have trouble clutching out solo wins though I get down to the last 3 with no problem. 

**Milestone:**

Today it was time I decided to buy my **first** item in the shop: I purchased the laser chomp glider. The very next game I hopped in I ended up clutching out a solo with a Victory Royale.

As someone that never spends money on DLC cheers to fortnite for a truly rewarding gaming experience that is not pay to win and cheers to this sub for the laughs, creativity, tips and communication!

Now, I do use 20s and 50s for challenges, but I do it the right way. The right way being, I finish the game out and actually try and frag. For practice mostly or just casual gaming.

Been seeing an alarming amount of players that do challenges, then immediately go off themselves to get out of the game. This is ruining the game for people that actually want to play the game rather than walk into a firing squad at the end circle. It's happening more and more. I just seeing 4-5 people go grab the treasure, then jump to their death. Or down rather. I followed this guy and revived him 3 times, until he finally gave up and ran halfway across the map to jump off the edge of it so I couldn't revive him anymore.

Can we think of a way to prevent this, and if you're one of those players doing this, please just play the game. I knew it was only gonna be a matter of time until people started abusing these modes because stats aren't tracked. One fix for starters, leave the wall in place to prevent people from jumping off the map completely. Perhaps even not allow their challenge to be counted if they become suicidal.",FortNiteBR

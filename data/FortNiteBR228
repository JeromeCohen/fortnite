I pre-ordered the Note 9 and was able to claim the VBucks Promotion and Galaxy Skin last Friday. I then uninstall the app for my phone.

After re-downloading the Application from the Samsung Store, I signed into my nephews Epic Account. Play three matches yesterday. After then signing back in today under his Epic account the Galaxy skin was there.

I'm not sure if the promotion is triggered based upon the application and itself however it doesn't seem like anything from the device outside of the application registers the Galaxy Skin.

TLDR,
If you own the Note 9 there is a possibility that you may be able to get the skin for an extra family or friend.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

Currently fortnite is the most popular game rolling into season 5. I enjoyed fornite season 3 and 4 but 5 has a smg meta meaning that shotguns are no longer the main weapon but Smg the most op and unskilled weapon where you pull the trigger  and that's  it.  double pumping was removed as well and I don't think that its a terrible decision to remove double pumping but the fact that the pump is incredibly slow and underpowered means you will lose each spray fight and no matter the building you do you will have to spray. it makes the game almost unplayable now the unbalance for variety theme the game is 100% rng luck based and it makes me sick that I paid for this season I cant have fun in fortnite anymore because spraying is not fun.

&amp;#x200B;

Season 5 Battle Pass

season 5 skins are so random and forgettable I liked season 4 and had a long and thoughtful grind for the skins

but season 5 is just too random sure drift is I cool and inspired character but sun strider and the rest had no thought put into them there are less skins to earn toys are forgettable the whole season feels hollow and just the worst ive seen.

&amp;#x200B;

GameModes-

&amp;#x200B;

ScoreRoyale-I actually liked this one on launch but you know the rule when your having fun epic games ruins it

&amp;#x200B;

you collect loot and open chests to get points eliminations and Gold copper silver coins gave points as well once a player hit 2000 points the game ended it was fun and balanced besides the Smg Meta and I enjoyed it then later I came to return to my favorite game mode WHATS THIS the game was updated and now you are forced to play duo it ruined the game causing the most unbalanced warzone out there it was not fun and I left. if you ask me rather then having LTM

why not just make it all gamemodes are playable and that you can select between duo solo squads then force us to play what we don't want to play.

&amp;#x200B;

why not just make it all game modes are playable and that you can select between duo solo squads then force us to play what we don't want to play.

&amp;#x200B;

Solid Gold-Just don't play this one

Hate it HATE IT its abysmal the gamemode could be fun but the fact the Double Barrel exists ruins the balance I hopped in a few times the first I landed in RetailRow got a Hand cannon and killed a no skin then I got a scar went into battle and died to a double barrel instantly I tired again looking for a double barrel and was unsuccessful fate set again the same thing I could not find a double barrel it became a guessing game when I took shots with my scar I had to decide if they had a double barrel. -Remove the double barrel I don't like it its useless.

&amp;#x200B;

PC Issues ok this is just poor-

I sometimes play on my pc and let me tell you the game would stutter so far I had to manually look up a fix

the game wont run on high settings even though my computer is way over minimum the optimization is a joke

audio issues when plugging in a mic frequent crashes.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Analysis -The game sucks

here me out this game is good only with friends even then looking at a pile of shit is better with friends

the game is currently unbalanced and mostly unplayable I don't have any reason to return at any point id rather play Realm Royale then touch this garbage again. -All I hope is epic games hears the community and fixes these issues because they are killing there cash cow",FortNiteBR

I have never bought anything before on Fortnite, and this is obviously my first purchase. It looks a little promising with the amount of items you get each level, compared to the free one. I'm on the fence if I should buy it, so I'm gonna see if this could help me decide. 

Pros:

\- Only $10, not too expensive

\- You keep the items

\- Lots of items, would cost more than $10 if you could buy them seperately

\-  Finally would have a skin

&amp;#x200B;

Cons:

\- Only cosmetics

\- I don't play Fortnite all the time (That could change if I buy it)

\-  No skill improvements 

\- Season 5 ends in less than a month",FortNiteBR

So let’s get that knocked out really quick. I generally enjoy playing Fortnite but I have a hard time digging into it lately. I’m a more of a social gamer and always have at least one reliable partner to play with, but life has gotten busy for us and we rarely sync up anymore. 

I want to sit and play but for the life of me I just can’t do it sometimes. Without my party, I can’t find enjoyment in the grind. I tilt way easier when going solo, challenges feel more like a chore, etc.  I’m more middle of the road, mostly below average player so the whole “loot, gather mats, get eliminated on sight” routine gets stale. The times I do sit down solo usually wind up going “play 3 matches, get bored/frustrated, load up Rocket League”

How do I “fall back in love” with Fortnite again? Or at least make solo queuing more bearable? I have no issue solo queuing in RL but doing it in Fortnite just feels...daunting almost. ",FortNiteBR

All heals would work the exact same, small (25) up to half, bigs (50) to full, bandages (15) up to 300, slurps still gives 75, chugs are 100/100.  If one squad member takes all 400/800 damage, the whole squad is eliminated.  You live and die as a squad.  Mats would go up to 4k in each category, and any member can use the mats that anyone has harvested.  

I think it would be interesting to see new strategies come out of this. One I can think of is having a true medic on the squad.  He would have 4 slots of heals and only 1 weapon.  During gunfights his job would be to constantly consume heals for the squad under cover.

Another may be to pull off synchronized sniper shots to try and get 800 worth of damage in HS on one enemy with his head poking out.

One clear counter argument would be the reliability of your squad mates, one wrong move by any of them and the whole squad is gone.

Please consider ways to increase mobility to the game in general, as a counter to stale midgame.","As new POIs were added to the game, the number of players alive in a match started decreasing very fast.

Sometimes in the second circle you have 20 people left alive, creating a very stale midgame.

With this season and the addition of rifts and atks, we realized that increasing the mobility will not harm the game. Quite the opposite, it counters the player drop problem.

Soaring 50's (We miss you already) also brought up a new way to move around, creating a very fast paced match.

These changes are very welcome to the game, and we should let Epic know how much love we have for this increased mobility. 

Please Mr. Epic continue to improve mobility in the game!

First and foremost please excuse the awful formatting/grammar/whatever else may be wrong in this post. I’m laying in bed as I type this on my phone. So, I have a couple of good irl friends of mine, who are brothers, and they both play wagers and tournaments on CMG. And they’ve won a lot. One of them already has made about 6k since November. About a month ago in our group Snapchat, they were bragging about how they have this new script and they will never lose now, and how much money they will win and blah blah blah. Now I don’t know the exact details on how they do it. I’m aware of some kind of usb they can plug into their Xbox (we are all Xbox players) and it gives them a huge aim assist. And it’s super noticeable. The cursors jump all around and he spams his zoom every time he shoots. Nothing looks natural about it. Plus he streams on mixer daily and I actually have a video I recorded on my Snapchat of him blatantly cheating. I just don’t know what to do about it. I gave them a really hard time about it when I first found out because I haven’t cheated in a game since 2001 when GTA3 came out. I despise people who cheat and get over on the rest of competitive community. Plus they’re actually taking money from people and winning tournaments for high dollar amounts. It makes me hesitant to play on those tournament/wager sites knowing that these 2 lousy nimwads can cheat and get away with it so easily on probably the biggest site. So I guess my whole point of this post is to know what would you guys do? ",FortNiteBR

I feel in love with Fortnite at the end of  season 1, right after they added in the bush I am a relatively casual player, but have put about £50 into the game and have amassed just over 200 solo wins. However, season 5 is horrible. The story line is fantastic, don't get me wrong, but the skill gap has just gone. As soon as I get the high ground in a build fight, somebody who I am, with all due respect, much better than, just drops down and shoots me out, waiting to spray me down with an SMG. Building is supposed to 'provide cover' but all the materials are like paper and you're better off just shooting back. The very essence of the game, building, which set it out from the competition, is evidently trying to be removed by the developers as they nerf it to oblivion. The game has become so much more luck based, with shotguns being  destroyed and the rise of the SMG, your survival is entirely dependent on RNG and bloom.

To keep me playing the game, all I want is some balance, where shotguns are as good as SMGs and building is an effective way of protecting yourself in a fight. I appreciate that this is hard to achieve, and Epic wont listen to the views of me alone, but if you would like to say something, whether you agree or disagree, i'd love to hear it in the comments below.

It allowed you to drop wherever you liked without having to worry too much about the first circle, especially since it doesn't appear until fifteen seconds of bus time to go. 

It also allowed for bigger and better fights, because nowhere near as many teammates were dying to the storm anymore, they could make it to the circle and fight.

And last, but not certainly not least, it was the perfect counter against toxic teammates who would shoot out your ramps. 

I understand you're experimenting with 50v50 and that's fine, but surely you could implement Solid Gold or any other aspect along with the ability to soar. 

In my opinion, it should be a permanent fixture from this point on and there was absolutely no reason to get rid of it, especially since the player base had gotten so used to it and made the mode a lot more enjoyable.

If you agree, let Epic know and maybe they'll bring it back soon.

I've been playing FN on Switch since launch and I've seen the poor performance and lag and glitches at launch, but 90% of these issues disappeared either due to their performance updates on a weekly basis or just flat-out deleting FN from the SDcard, removing it, and then reinstalling into internal storage. Since two weeks ago at the time of this post, I have never had any of the issues NintendoLife claims there are with this game. I literally got a bug or glitch-free 7 kill win last night, after finally finding that sweet spot between physical and motion controls. A little internet research can go a long way before you take to Twitter and complain about devs.

Hi r/FortniteBR

Apologies if this is the wrong place but I really need some help from epic and I know they regularly check this sub.


I've been trying to get my account security to the highest level possible as my friend got hacked recently which scared me.

Unfortunately although epic appeared as if they would help me they closed my ticket instantly on the basis I had taken to long to respond (longer than 30 seconds)

I appreciate that this is a really busy game and no company is perfect when it comes to support, and this could just be human error, but experiences like this aren't fun as a gamer.

All I want to do is make my account more secure (and, of course, get that sweet sweet free skin for doing so)

Not trying to attack epic staff here, really happy with the game and the way they handle it in general, just hoping they don't become steam support v2.0",FortNiteBR

Its honestly so annoying that snipers can 1 shot you from full hp and shield. It shouldn't be this easy for a bad player to 1 shot a good player with no counter play. It happens so many times to me its unreal. You also see this at high level play. Top tier players will just 3rd party snipe at teams fighting hoping they get lucky and 1 shot some one.

So I thought about having others abilities connected to each stone, then I realised that giving Thanos all those powers from the start would be too OP. Hence I came up with a new system for Infinity Gauntlet LTM 2.0:

Changes

- Buffing Thanos’ health and shields to encourage players to work together.

- Before the Infinity Gauntlet appears on the map, five Infinity Stones (Space, Reality, Soul, Time and Mind) spawn random at locations, yet always with a sizeable distance between each other. The Power Stone comes with the Infinity Gauntlet.

- Each Stone is an item that requires an empty slot to be picked up.

- Anyone who picks up an Infinity Stone, who we’ll call a “Keeper”, can use that Stone’s power. The Stone will drop if the Keeper is killed.

- Each stone has a different ability (with a cooldown). These are abilities are:

- **Space Stone **: Allows the Keeper to teleport by aiming the Space Stone anywhere and firing. This teleportation has a limited range (Still thinking about what a good limit would be).

- **Reality Stone **: Allows the Keeper to turn invisible, but they can’t attack, still make noise and kick up dust when they run.

- **Soul Stone **: Allows the Keeper to see the silhouettes of others within a certain radius.

- **Time Stone **: Allows the Keeper to “fast-forward”, which temporarily grant them a speed boost.

- ** Mind Stone **: Allows the Keeper to create an illusionary decoy.

- If Thanos picks up a Stone, it will become permanently attached to the Infinity Gauntlet, allowing Thanos to use its unique ability.

- If Thanos collects all the Stones, he’ll snap his finger and all remaining players will lose half their health *OR* half the remaining players are instantly eliminated (Wonder which one would be more satisfying).

I’m open to hearing feedback and other suggestions.",FortNiteBR

Imagine dusty divot being completely filled with water and the wreckage of the building is left underneath to rot. My idea is that it was completely filled with water and the player is able to swim underneath the water for a short period of time.

This could allow for scuba gear to be added to the game and they would work in a way like the gliders are. The scuba gear would appear on the player when they go underneath the water like a glider would appear on a player when using a launch pad.

Being able to swim underwater could switch the game up by putting player in to some new situations, players can still shoot underneath the water however accuracy is heavily affected making the player get into close quarter combat. Also building would be removed in this part of the map making for some tactical situations and pushing the player to their limits.

Loot would also spawn in this part of the map as well as chests making this still a place to land.

Two minutes in, I’m drinking a Chug Jug, and bam, someone one pumps me for no reason. Later, when the round has actually begun, I kill them fair and square. Then they blame it on lag, or ‘their finger slipping’. 

Sometimes I play a three person FFA, and two of them team against me purely because I killed them (what makes them angrier is that they can’t blame me for cheating because I never did). Like what the fuck? Why is everyone such a bad sport? They spawn kill, cheat and complain.

So as you know, the option to have the Two-Factor Authentication via an authenticator app has been available only for a couple of days now. Previously it used to be only emails with 6-digit security codes. Even though I'd like to change it to the authenticator app now, I can't.

Back in december, I think, someone continuosly tried to gain access to my account, so I obviously turned on the 2FA. It's been working fine until sometime around last month. Emails started to be very delayed (to the point that sometimes I had to disable 2FA for the sake of logging in). The fact that I'm constantly being asked for a new code, even though I always click ""Remember this device"" is not helping either.

For about two weeks now I haven't received any email with a security code from Epic, not even ONE. Other emails from them come to me just fine (support tickets confirmations, some priomotional stuff, etc.), so I'm positive that my email provider didn't blacklist the epicgames domain.

I'm not authenticated in any browser to disable the 2FA. I'm not even able to play on my PC because I can't log into the Epic Games Launcher. The only place I am authenticated is the Fortnite Mobile app on my Android phone, but that doesn't help, since there is no way for me to access the account from there.

So essentially even though I know the password to my account and I have access to my email address, I cannot log into my Epic Games Account. I've been trying to log in at different times of the day to maybe find a spot when the servers are not overloaded, but so far no luck. I've already tried contacting support, but they take forever to respond, so I'm out of ideas.",FortNiteBR

&amp;#x200B;

# 1. Loading Issues:

The Switch features slow loading when it comes to booting the game and when joining a match

&amp;#x200B;

# 2. Wibbly Wobbly Enforcer:

The Enforcer looks like a screwed up 3d render,warping through the very space-time continuum of the Fortnite world . Been told this issue is a common occurrence on the mobile port as well

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Mushy Building Textures:

Landing in highly popular areas like Tilted Towers stresses the game on the Switch to the point that the textures look like mush. Upon landing on such mush,players will quickly vibrate up and down.

# 4. Dynamic Resolution sticking to the lower end of its range:

Dynamic resolution kicks in much quicker now,leading to a blurry mess. Even in completely empty towns, a fence in the distance tends to 'move' on-spot  like a player. The in-game menu is rather blurry as well,leading to tan-skinned characters having eyes that look tan,due to the rather indistinguishable nature of the low-res  nature of the in-game menu.

![img](ifli2jnvhsi11 ""Ramirez now"")

![img](q6rtxbgigsi11 ""Ramirez then"")

# 5. Frame-rate:

Need I say more? Frame-rate takes severe drops when fighting in 50v50, and even in squad fights. Frame-rate takes dips to 22fps rather easily

# 6.First weapon pick-up lag:

Upon picking one's first weapon in a populated town,the game freezes for 1-3 seconds,rendering the player vulnerable to shots

![video](zymp7cvzdsi11 ""No players at all,yet still lags. "")

# 7.Motion-controls:

Motion controls tends to 'snap' to a position,and isn't as smooth as other games that run at 30fps and incorporate motion controls,like Zelda

# 8. Stretched Loading Screen:

Upon booting up the game,the player is greeted with a screen consisting of the Season 5 crew - Drift,Ragno,Rook,Sunstrider,etc. After it loads,it loads the same screen yet again,yet this time,the loading screen looks steretched and blurry

![img](5j6e1whsbsi11 ""NormalBoi"")

![img](i5fl9qxpbsi11 ""Stretched-Boi"")

# 9. Non-existent cloth physics:

Cloths and even armor phase through the character's body parts upon triggering and emote.  

![video](9ycht6rjbsi11 ""Amazing cloth physics-boi"")

# 10. Non-existent career tab:

The career tab is missing,as is the same with the replays. Wins on the switch in solos dont apparently count over,when you use the PC version,and view your stats

# 11.Voice-chat issues:

Voice chat hardly ever works,and requires a restart to be capable of hearing or speaking anything.

# 12. Jet-engine fan:

Though nothing can be done about it,as it is the only way to ensure the once stable performance of Fortnite on the Switch, the fan sounds like a jet engine when playing in seemingly empty areas.

# 13. In-explainable giant yellow flashes that take the entire screen after using explosives like the guided missile?????:

Upon using the guided missile,the screen will sometimes fill up with giant yellow flashes that obscure everything in view.

![video](ews5l9fmesi11 ""Imagine this,except it takes up the entire screen when in combat"")

# 14. Extremely bland-looking contrails.

&amp;#x200B;

![img](tdqnkexadsi11 ""Contrails look very bland. Lanterns have a low-poly count. Also note that there are only 25 people in total in this 50v50 match (wtf?)"")

# 15. Audio cuts out for emotes:

&amp;#x200B;

Compare the # of chests in desert town to named locations: 

Tilted Towers - 40     
Retail Row - 19

Pleasant Park - 17

Snobby Shores - 11    
Lucky Landing - 11    
Junk Junction - 10     
Wailing Woods - 9     
Dusty Divot - 8    

I did these locations by approximating what seemed reasonable, so your favorite location might be off by 1 or 2 chests if you stretch the boundaries a bit, but still, Desert Town comes in 3rd place and there's never *any* competition there. You might be hesitant to land because of how far it is from the circle, but no worries, they conveniently leave *both* a golf cart and several rifts nearby to quickly get to the circle. There's also plentiful amounts of ground loot and ammo boxes to supplement how great of a landing location it is already. 

I dunno if it's just cause it's unnamed on the map that no one lands there, but y'all might want to start considering it. ",FortNiteBR

A few days ago I was interested to see if any shotgun in the game could still one shot in a perfect situation (the answer is no), so my friend and I tested all of them in playground mode and recorded the results. This got me wondering, what can kill faster; a shotgun or an SMG? So then we tested damages on all SMGs, head and body shots and recorded those results.

Once that was done, I figured out a formula for Time to Kill from full (200) health and recorded those results in [this table](https://imgur.com/a/FmZx0Yk). I also tested these experimentally in playground mode. These times assume a situation where every shot hits its mark with no damage drop off, but it I think it is still a valuable tool in comparison. Interestingly there is only one shotgun which can beat an SMG: the double barrel. However this basically requires you to touch your enemy in order to make every pellet connect. The drum gun is vastly superior to everything in the table; the only thing that beats it is the double barrel on perfect body shots. It still wins drastically in head shots. Also interesting I threw in a base AR out of curiosity, and it beats every shotgun except the double barrel in both head and body shot TTK.

I think this shows that shotguns are just a little too weak right now, and that carrying a shotgun without another close range weapon is not really viable. Would love to hear everyone's opinion on this.

In addition I wrote a macro in Microsoft Excel which allows calculation of TTK of any weapon as long as you know base damage, headshot damage(optional), and fire rate. It can be downloaded [from this google drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kVVoD1t-YOfPbvOlLzw2AfTlEuu8HQ_Z/view?usp=sharing) if you are interested.

A lot has happened over this period of time so I want to explain my case and I want you to support me. I hope Epic Games can take consideration with a lot of points that are made not only by me but by everyone that is a member of the community who can make sensible decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

1: Gameplay

Never have I been unmotivated to play a normal game of battle royale. Unlike moments from season 2 and 3, now the gameplay is a lot more boring. Due to the fact you earn fewer mats from many sources of wood, stone, and metal, gaining resources is a chore. It’s not fun slicing a tree into bits for 5 seconds and then repeating 100 times, especially when you can find people to fight, and places to travel. When I do get into fights, all players just spam build and turtle, instead of trying to play aggressively. This playstyle is boring for both players in the fight, and it rewards the defensive player with an extreme advantage, with many ways to follow up. Attackers have very little to do other than use what I’ll be talking about next, the SMGs. SMGs in season five are the superior close range assault, and this is a problem. Due to the fact that the SMGs tear down walls very quickly defeats the main mechanic of the battle royale. Why build if it’s just going to get destroyed, and you waste materials in the process? Unlike the SMGs, the shotguns are completely underpowered. The best shotgun in the game (currently), the double barrel, is incredibly underpowered due to its very short range and for that range, the damage isn’t great. The heavy shotguns and tactical shotguns are way too weak as well, and the pump is incredibly slow. The only good tactic that uses shotguns that aren’t annoying, is Pump/Deagle, which is still an underpowered strategy. The Deagle (and its weaker variant, the revolver) as a whole needs to be buffed greatly. These two are useless right now because they are outclassed in everything, and they are too accurate to accomplish anything. I wish that a lot of weapons were made viable. Most of the underpowered weapons are weapons that use random spread or bloom. The Assault Rifles are the best example of this because they are too inconsistent for good results, and because, like the Deagle, they are outclassed by better weapons. So, to summarize, the gameplay is boring, the meta is unbalanced, and many weapons are useless.

&amp;#x200B;

2. The Community

The number one reason I am starting to give up on this game. A lot of people on the subreddit are great people, and I will say that this subreddit is the only place where I enjoy Fortnite content, whether it is art, funny edits, or great memes. Thank you for making me believe that this community had people who were actually competent.

On the other hand, I want to start by saying that what I see on Twitter replies, Youtube comments, and other posts, are annoying and dumb. Many people saying to return Double Pump, saying to bring back Power Chord, saying that they are selling accounts or giving away V-Bucks, saying that they want a skin that is a fucking Halloween themed skin when it’s not Halloween, saying that they want certain LTMs back, and more spammy shit. I’m tired of seeing tweets and comments that use the same thing. There needs to be moderation in all of these social media platforms. The one suggestion is to disable youtube comments, live chat for live streams, and block all spam on twitter regarding fortnite. The reason why I’m so salty over this is that quotes from these kids are soiling the fanbase of this game. What takes actual skill to create for this community is washed over by the same children who annoy Epic Games, thinking they can make a change. Please, if you are one of the people who do this, please stop immediately. What you are doing is providing Epic Games with filler to wade through.

So they can’t just use Pink Lightning all Willy Nilly without it all being connected to each other

If you look at [Week 6’s Loading Screen](https://s3.dexerto.com/thumbnails/_thumbnailLarge/week-6-loading-screen-fortnite-clean.jpg) you can see that the Mask is glowing with the electricity while drift doesn’t have it on 

So I think with this information a few things could happen in these last few weeks

A. We have one more big event before the season ends of the anomaly and the mask coming together
( This is considering that The anomaly is going to Drifts week 9 location where ever that may be)

B. A Thanos like mode where you put on the Mask and basically become a God and use that pink lightning to kill people
( This is literally just putting what I want out there but it would make sense, the pink lightning already has the ability to kill people and has a name in the killfeed)


C.  The Anomaly is heading to the exact spot between Durr Burger and The God Tomato and brings them to life and the Big Event of this season is a giant Kiju sized fight between the two mascots/Gods ( Lol)

D. Literally Anything Else

E.Literally Nothing Happens

What I didn't realize was my friend was signed into my browser with his Fortnite account. It didn't prompt me with any username or anything to confirm it, so now his account was rewarded with my Galaxy Skin and my V-Bucks.

I'm trying to figure out how I can remove the skin and v-bucks from his account to put it on mine, as I've been waiting 4 days for this email to come and now it's been redeemed to his account. This is beyond irritating and I'm fed up with the support both companies offer. I've been put on hold for over an hour.

I dont see epic provide us with any incentives to play except the game is fun for a while ?! really?

Was hoping i was still first to use phone (one per phone) Took 22 hours for skin to appear on PC account. Hearing best buy stores is a bad idea/ blocking them. Here are the steps.

1. Go to at&amp;t, verizon, sprint store.
2. Dont sign into store help so they dont call your name
3. Go to samsung galaxy note 9 display.
4. Use personal hotspot if wifi is bad on your current phone to supply internet to note 9.
5. Turn off retail mode on phone if it is on. Code is 5444 Check by swiping down settings from the top of phone. It will be a notification if it is running.
6. Log into samsung email on ""Galaxy Apps""( make new email account for Samsung if you dont have one before you go to store.
7. Once logged in galaxy apps download fortnite. There will be a galaxy skin redemption once the installer starts. Takes around 15-25 minutes for download. Then another 10 minutes in game download once the game launches to optimize.
8. Log into your epic account. Not sure if ps4 works since sony sucks at sharing.
9. Play 3 games . I played 3 solo games and landed titled and got killed by a weaponed player. Wait for the elimination text to appear and you to start spectating the other player. After about 10 seconds hit return to lobby from the bottom right option. DO NOT LEAVE GAME. Play as many as quickly as possible passed 3 if time permits. I played 6 for safety. 
10. Log out of your fortnite account in game. Uninstall fortnite or leave game installed for next player. Some reports of multiple redemptions per phone has been reported.
11. Log out off samsung galaxy apps application.
12. Turn retail mode back on the phone and leave it exactly how you found it.

Notes. This process takes around 30-40 minutes. If retail mode is off you can walk away from phone while it downloads. Leave your hotspot wifi phone as close as possible for fastest speeds. DO NOT HOG THE PHONE, this is not your phone and be courteous to anyone trying to sample the phone as a potential buyer, unless they are trying to steal your skin. If a. Employee asks what you are doing say you are a huge phone gamer and you want to test your favorite game on the new phone. If asked to leave, ABSOLUTELY thank them and be polite. If possible talk to a manager about your intentions prior to all of this. Go when the store opens or when it is not too busy. 

GOOD LUCK!",FortNiteBR

If you’re about to ask me for my win count, don’t bother. I’m not the greatest player. I am however a good teammate, appropriate use of call outs etc. I’m not to bad in the kills department, generally get down to the last ten people in a game with anywhere from 4-10 kills and than I choke out. 

Not in it to win it, wins are nice, but just looking to have some fun with older people and a similar mindset.

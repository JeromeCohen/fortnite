I got a PC because I realized if I wanted to be the best I could be I had to play at 144fps or more. This generations consoles aren‚Äôt getting you anything over 60 fps. If they add an FOV slider that will make your FPS even lower.  They aren‚Äôt going to remove shadows either. If you want to compete get a PC. That goes for every e sport except COD. ,FortniteCompetitive

This is also one of the reasons console players cant qualify for big tournaments. Not because the game is so badly optimized that they barely have 10 fps endgame. If you are a PC player stop being so selfish. Think about that console players cant afford a PC.

Here at epic we like think to about everyone and make things as fair as possible. Our motto is ""its our way or the highway"". So we basically dont give a shit what you say about the changes we make. We also like to fuck people over.

Also do you have [microstutters](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b9f66z/like_legit_watch_this_clip_and_tell_me_that_they/)? Dont be mad. Its part of the Epic Games experience.

Because there is such a small portion of them at the top they are only having a minuscule effect on que times.

The problem is, he's a bit of a dumbass when it comes to late game decision making. We're at 200 points right now in arena, so we're starting to get more hectic late games and better players. Me and him both have a pretty aggressive playstyle, but I myself put that away in games like that because I know it'll get me killed. My cousin however does not drop his aggro playstyle and will do anything to get meager amounts of damage on someone. Not to mention he always wants to drop tilted or some other contested drop to, quote: ""get some early points in"". I've tried to tell him that his playstyle just doesn't work out that often in these bigger lobbies late game, and we shouldn't do hot drops because the bus fare will punish us for bad loot off spawn, and that we shouldn't use every utility in our inventory just to damage someone but he just doesn't listen to me. I get that he has more fun that way and to be fair we usually do come out of hot drops alive and make it to end game but that may not be the case once we get to the big league divisions. I just need some advice so that I can talk sense into him because more than half the times we die, it's because he played too aggressively or he makes a bad play (obviously I am prone to making mistakes too, I'm not ignoring that fact). Him and I both want to get to higher divisions but I'm afraid he's not going to stop being hyper-aggressive and we're gonna be stuck because of the bus fare. ",FortniteCompetitive

They are ""investing"" a ton of prize money into it and must expect some sort of return from that.

Option one: The pros and everyone aspiring to become one and earn money through Fortnite. That seems unlikely with some of the changes they've been making and how they don't ask for the pros' opinions, fix bugs or communicate with the pro community about their choices and intentions. This group doesn't really include most console and mobile players that recent changes seem to favour.

Option two: The viewers. That's the category I see myself in. That also seems unlikely because most viewers have pros or teams they're rooting for and it's pissing me off that their chances are negatively affected by lots of these changes. Communication and information for viewers is also terrible and usually hard to come by or short notice. I was more hyped and well-informed during the week before Keemstar Friday Fortnite events than I am for this weekend's 500k (!!) tournament.  Individual streamers and pros usually have more viewers during tournaments than the official Fortnite stream. 

Option three: Casual players and kids? Do they care? Do the tournaments and the World Cup even work as an advertisement for them if there's so little information out and all their favourite streamers and pro players are annoyed, streaming other games out of frustration and constantly complaining about stupid decisions and bad communication?

It seems like most content updates seem to be directed at casuals and kids, ewhich might make sense in a short-sighted way if you ignore the fact that these kids watch streamers and pros and value their opinions on the game. Other updates seem to be aimed at trying to""level the playing field"" for different platforms whose players probably have little intention or no real chances at competing in the World Cup but most likely also have favourite streamers and pros whose opinions and chances they are invested in.

Anyways, long post. Thanks for reading. What's your opinion on Epic's thought process for this massive World Cup?",FortniteCompetitive

Like... how much effort does it take to dedicate a single person to answering questions and taking feedback from us.

It honestly seems like Epic is the narcissitic leader that just *knows* what will work, then they just throw the update out and just laughs at any feedback they get.

After the World Cup, I wouldn't be surprised if orgs/pros start pulling out, then they're going to start losing sponsors and then MAYBE they'll see the damage they're causing and then they'll start trying, and even then, it would have to make headlines and be bad for their PR for them to even notice it.

They've failed time and time again, I'm just a casual scrimmer but I can't even begin to imagine how frustrating and worrying it must be for the actual pros that don't know what dumb vehicle ot anti-meta item gets added (boomboxes, rpg splash dmg, god there's too many to even list)

Imagine if Epic games actually asked what people wanted to see in the game, they gave their reasons for potentially making an update, created open discussion amongst everyone and proper justification.

Every since season 8, Epic has trying their absolute hardest to kill this game. Help me create a list with everything wrong with this game. Please leave everything I missed below.

&amp;#x200B;

* Shotguns not shooting - This has been around since season 4 and has only gotten worse

&amp;#x200B;

* Shooting through walls - Shitty since season 7

&amp;#x200B;

* Edit/Build delay - Weren't these fixed at one point?

&amp;#x200B;

* Ballers in arena - Still OP for endgame after their ""nerf""

&amp;#x200B;

* Tac shotguns being inconsistent - 137 dmg then 20, should have same pellet affect with pump

&amp;#x200B;

* Same item pool for arena and casual - Incredibly unbalanced, IMO competitive pools shouldn't be filled with 'slpodes and casual modes need shield as well

&amp;#x200B;

* Siphon removed from normal modes - Everyone loved it, and they kill it?

&amp;#x200B;

* Console performance Performance on all platforms - Friend with a 2080 ti can't even hold 100 fps endgame

&amp;#x200B;

*  Finding ammo with no gun - This has to be one of the most disappointing moments in a game

&amp;#x200B;

* Shotgun delay with one shotty in your inventory - Wasn't this a nerf to double shotty not single

&amp;#x200B;

* Cannons shooting you sideways - Seems pretty recent to me, hasn't happened to me before 8.10

&amp;#x200B;

* Inconsistent fall damage - Been happening since season 5, has anyone else noticed?

&amp;#x200B;

* Sound in general - Weapons can be so loud you can't even hear your team mate, then other times footsteps are non existent until they've killed you

&amp;#x200B;

* Glider redeploy freaking out - You go to jump and it just pulls out your glider

There has been an abundant amount of posts coming in right now regarding the new Epic blog post [""Competitive Fortnite State of Development""](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/competitive/en-US/news/competitive-fortnite-state-of-development-4-3-19). Mainly regarding the stretched resolution section

&gt;STRETCHED RESOLUTION

&gt;In the near future, we will be updating how we handle custom resolutions on PC. When using a custom resolution, vertical FOV will be locked. Horizontal FOV will be unlocked in all modes, but in competitive playlists (e.g. Arena and in-game tournaments) we will be locking the aspect ratio to 16:9.

We will be removing posts regarding this topic to keep the subreddit clean. Please use this thread to discuss the blog posts and the new changes. Make sure to also press F to pay your respects. ",FortniteCompetitive

I am a console player, I enjoy the challenge of playing against computer players as although I know I am at a clear disadvantage in most aspects of the game (besides L triggering) it is fun to fight against the best and on some occasions, win. The crazy thing is people are freaking out about stretched being removed for WC. I mean C'mon there is no balance in having stretched res in the game, as a console player I cannot play stretched so why should pc players have this option. In order for the competition to be as balanced as possible stretched can't be in the game. Its not fair to a huge segment of players who are already at an innate disadvantage. To those who say console players won't even have a chance to qualify, I believe this is untrue. I play on a 40 inch HD TV on my couch and have qualified for 1/2 of the solo finals so far and 1/2 of the duo finals. Imagine if we even the playing field even more for console, maybe myself along with the other console players will have a fighting chance.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately its about providing all players with an even chance of qualifying. The fact of the matter is that stretched provides a huge advantage, I honestly wouldn't mind if it was possible to play stretched on console but for reasons that I don't fully comprehend this is not a possibility. So stop bitching, we all put time in the game, we all dream about qualifying to the WC. Just because you play on a PC doesn't mean you deserve it more than the next guy playing on Xbox or Ps4. Tough luck, adapt. If you cant adapt to these changes I guarantee you don't have a fighting chance at worlds. Gg's ",FortniteCompetitive

So here is my solution. Since cross platform is not an issue, make matchmaking input specific but even more specific. This is literally what you all think you want right? Make it so if you‚Äôre playing on console on a TV. You only play against players with similar inputs, if you‚Äôre on PC with a monitor then you can play against others doing the same and make stretch res an option when matchmaking with those settings. Same for those who play with plug in controllers on pc, make them have their own matchmaking as well. Same if you play on console with scuff controllers, separate from normal controllers. Since we all can‚Äôt play the same base game without optimizing it to make it easier for ourselves... like I don‚Äôt understand why we need all this unnecessary bs, because guess what? If you need a monitor that displays frames faster than your eye can see, and 40 extra buttons on your controller, or a resolution that allows you to see more than you could on normal res. then are you really that good? I play on a 4 year old tv, with a normal PS4 controller and I am not ever one to complain. I still compete regularly and just try to get better. I think the fact that people can not compete without all of these enhancements is crazy tbqh. If you can‚Äôt play the game at its core and still play at that skill level then that should speak volumes. The top tier players we watch don‚Äôt truly need it they just prefer it to make their job easier. So the solution to epics problem truthfully would be to limit all variations of gameplay to what they strictly want it to be, competitively speaking. In comp if they don‚Äôt want stretched res because they think it‚Äôs unfair let them do it. If they wanna ban the use of scuffs from official tournaments let them, if they want to have separate console and pc tournaments let them because the way the community is complaining is not a solution, it‚Äôs just perpetuating the problems we have. Epic has a vision for a game where anyone can compete, not for anyone with a decent monitor, not for anyone with a pc. They want everyone, from mobile, to switch, to have a fair chance, and I think if they can‚Äôt get it right soon enough, then maybe these platforms were truly never meant to cross, competitively speaking.

Most Korean and Chinese league pros all play on custom resolutions. 

Nearly all CS pros play on a stretched resolution.

Overwatch offers a slider up to 103 FOV and their game is well optimised.


I feel like EPIC is banning custom resolutions because their replay client is dogshit and the community is run by children who have no desire to compete at the highest level. 

All other games can have each user running whatever resolution they like and it doesn't affect the viewing experience. 

Furthermore, to the argument in regards to console. If anyone truly wanted to compete at the highest level, they would have switched like in any other Esport.

* Today, They are literally addressing and patching stretched resolution after a year, and right before Fortnites biggest tournament yet. So now you can play ranked game modes with awful FOV.   


The reasoning behind both of these updates is awful. Forcing people to play native because console players are limited is unfair. Are you going to limit PC players to motion blur and 60hz as well? Or shadows? Or epic graphics? Siphon in regular game modes is gone and nobody plays regulars on stream. (look at what people are streaming before and after the removal of siphon). Siphon was desired by both parties. It's healthy for the game, stop saying it isn't.

A lot of people are looking for partners when a event rolls around. This would allow you to find and test playing with random players from your region around your skill level.


There are some obvious downsides though. You could get a player who either doesn't communicate or refuses to play as a team. However, even that could help you practice really bad situations in high level games like your partner dying off spawn.

Also an added option to only search for teammates with Mics would be even better.

I started playing this game on console mid-february 2018. Back then I was admittedly a noob; new to shooters if not video games. Eventually I did become ok at the game after 6 months, was able to maintain a KD marginally above 1 and even got a random 19 kill solo squad victory.

Around mid season 5 though I really started to struggle again and decided to make the switch to PC. It took me 3 attempts and I had to play unreal tournament for 2 months to get used to kbm but eventually I started to build muscle memory and be able to somewhat play and build on kbm.

Since then I have never been able to drag my kd above 1 (not that I usually try, but when I have done it has failed), my highest kills ever on PC is 12, and in the arena mode I currently sit at 180 points, but it is not increasing because I am not good enough to increase my score at a faster rate than the bus fair reduces it. I have tried to play scrims many times before but every time I seem to die off spawn or mid game to better players.

I should also point out that I watch an awful lot of fortnite as well. I have followed the competitive scene very closely since day 1 practically and I honestly would not be surprised if I have watched more than 6500 games of high quality gameplay. There is no obvious reason for me to be so bad. No, my sens (800DPI 0.07) is not too high, I have great peripherals and a great PC (although more than a 60hz monitor would be nice) yet I still (and this is also after dozens of hours of kovaaks) barely seem to be able to aim.

But the main problem I seem to have is my decision making at a microscopic level in particular. I seem to lose every fight with one small mistake or bad decision. I also seem to have an issue of getting my opponent down to very low health and then not getting the job done and killing him.

I have tried pretty much everything suggested, from creative and kovaaks, to watching pro players, to playing hyper aggressive, to watching every single replay of why I died and analysing it. Yet I still sit here as a fortnite player who can barely win a pub however hard I try.

Please help.",FortniteCompetitive

On PS4, I get what feels like 5 fps (who actually knows?) but I know that it's incredibly low. The game moves in slow motion and everything is blurry. I often can't move, can't build or can't edit properly. It's awesome being able to play these moving zones and get to experience the comp scene but it's actually impossible to play in. I know I can buy a PC but I'm a grad student, so I can't afford a PC. I just wish this game was viable enough to play on console and have fun. At this rate, division 6/7 are near impossible to perform consistently in because of this issues. I can win fights off spawn, play mid game fights and movement and usually place top 7 or 10 or whatever. It's just frustrating to die to performance or bugs when I'm having fun.

Watch for along as you can when you die and you‚Äôll see how mechanically better these players are than you. 

Example - my duo partner raged that his game lagged, in replay a player was tunnelling above  him, he dropped down places the floor in advance, edited pumped my duo partner.

Very fast, very smoothly, my team mate could of had the best gaming pc in the world but the fact is the player had the jump on him and in the heat of the moment.... flapping like we all do on console we don‚Äôt fully understand what‚Äôs happening.

Most of these console players only have so many points because of ballers, without them you‚Äôd be struggling a lot more.

Stop thinking you can even handle these end games, you wouldn‚Äôt get to them without the balls.

Me and my friend who are good players know that we only have so many points because of the ball....when you are on high points the lobbies are going to be stacked simple as that expect to play with better players.

May be placebo or something else but what the fuck is going on, i've played 5 matches today, died all 5 3 out of 5 times because of someone phasing through my wall while they're trying to replace it.

 They're not using that ramp trick or whatever, they're simply jumping right through my wall, is this a new exploit or are they playing on negative ping? (I have 30ms average).

I am decent using AR. I'm good at building and good at shotgunning, I'm trying to figure out if I should go for a high ADS or a low ADS based on my mouse movement.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me explain, I got a small table, and I don't got much mouse space, so I run really high DPI and really high in game sensitivity. I use 2050 DPI and use 0.53 X and 0.52 Y. A lot of people say that is insanely high and I should lower it down, I won't I'm very good at the game and I'm used to it. My building is completely perfect and my shotgun aim is good, is just my ADS sensitivity that I need to find out.

&amp;#x200B;

I notice streamers like Mongraal who use a lot of arm movement use extremely low ADS sensitivity he uses 0.19, and it makes sense. So I would assume players who don't use that much arm movement like me would go for high ADS, but I can't I miss and I barely move my hand. I do not use arm, I use wrist movement ONLY. So I don't understand how do people use 1.0 ADS and they use wrist or arm movement, it just seems impossible for me to land shots using that ADS.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently use 0.34. Just explain this to me, if a player uses arm should he use high ads or low ads, what if they use wrist? I don't own Kovaaks, so I can't really practice on it.",FortniteCompetitive

A game will take 20 minutes to play out, assuming it doesn't reach far into moving zones, so you're talking between 7-8 hours of playing to reach champions division at the very minimum. If you have to balance this game time with a job/study/sports, it's a real struggle to reach champions division. I think the divisions should've been based more on percentages (e.g: top 0.5% = champions, top 1% = Contenders 3, etc.), Showing the amount of points needed to qualify you for each division. With a reset every so often, this would basically introduce points decay, as those lower down the ranks will eventually be kicked out by anyone grinding for points. ",FortniteCompetitive

The predominant question seems to be ""if I'm in champs, and bus fare is -3, and if I'm eligible for tournaments in champs, why should i keep playing?""

&amp;#x200B;

There are 3 important answers to this question.  

1.  You cannot get relegated by falling below a point threshold-- if you throw a few games, and go below 300, you'll still be in champs.  
2. If you are on the competitive fortnite sub, you are likely invested in your own improvement as a player.  Arena mode is an unprecedented opportunity for limitless high quality practice (more so in solos than in duos).  You have the opportunity to work on all aspects of your competitive game, and more often than not, the access to high quality endgames (30-40+ moving zones in champs solos) 
3. The hard pill to swallow -- if you do not desire to play champs, or fear that you will be ""relegated"" or lose a substantial amount of points, you are probably not ready to place highly in the weekly tournaments.  You should feel confident in playing champs games (even for practice purposes) so as to prepare yourself and get the necessary practice for Worlds.  

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Despite the lack of palpable incentives for playing champs matches, you cannot get relegated, it is excellent practice, and if you don't want to lose points by playing champs, you probably aren't ready for the WC.  ",FortniteCompetitive

Now personally I would say I'm an above average Fortnite player but I'm nowhere near some of the best.  I'm currently at 227 pts in arena. I grinded hard with my friend on saturday getting 100 pts leading me to 200. Now I'm at 227 and late game is ridiculous for my console. Me and my friend try our hardest to win these games and normally we get at least 3-4 pts every game. It all goes fairly well until we reach about 4th-5th circle. where our frames drop to about 20-30. It's even worse when we try to rift or launch pad and we survey the whole area and at that point I can hear my console's fan under extreme stress. Consoles need to have some sort of way to turn down the graphic settings to low. We don't need shadows or high graphic settings, let us switch our graphic settings so we can at least be able to remain at 60 fps the whole game.  Now let me get to the second part of my thought, pubs are not fun anymore. I liked being able to get mats and shield after kills. I'm not gonna get any further into that bc we have all heard the complaints. My point is that I have no way to play Fortnite that is enjoyable to me. I can't play pubs because I dislike being at 75 health after dropping 4 kills at Tilted in one building and having about 200 mats, and playing arena all the time is very fun to me, I really love playing it but I can't seem to get past these end games. We struggle to play at 230 pts, imagine 280. This isn't just a me problem, this is a problem for every good and competitive console player. Epic needs to at least add some way to turn down the graphic settings, turn off shadows, or make pubs the same play style as arena. I'm sick of having this imaginary cap over my points, me and my friend have been turned off of Fortnite and just remain playing turtle wars for the time being because it seems that we literally can't advance any further in Fortnite until I get my PC all set up and ready. I really shouldn't have felt like I need a PC to advance in playing competitively but it's just was happened. I'm speaking up for every good console player right here.

433,Pblake99,1554213853,b8jmzb,70,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/b8jmzb/baller_tips_and_tricks/,173,Baller Tips and Tricks,"I discovered some tips and tricks with the baller, and more specifically, how to use them in arena, while I climbed from 0 to 290 points.

Time to Abuse the Meta:
1. NEVER leave your baller behind.
This one is pretty straight forward. Keep your baller close, so no one can come and grab it from under your foreskin.

2. If you are turtled with a baller, stay in the baller.
This one is a little more deep, allow me to explain.  Staying in the baller will prevent you from getting double heavy sniped in duos. Or Heavy sniper + rocket launcher in either mode.

3. If someone wants to get inside your box while you are turtling in your baller, let them. 
Just press jump and break everything around you, it is very unlikely they will be able to break your ball while you are bouncing around rapidly. This also makes them afraid because you are breaking a lot of cover and opening them up to third party's.

4. If a fellow baller gets out of their baller to break yours and fight you, fake build fight them and discretely drop down.
New baller for you, and no baller for enemy. 
Side note: Don't get out of your baller to break someone else's baller, they will become hungry for vengeance and either take your baller or break your baller.

5. Holding fire (trigger/ left mouse button) when your baller gets broken will instantly fire your held weapon.
This allows for easy one pumps, or at least full body shots, because the person breaking your baller literally can not react to a frame perfect pump shot. No one has expected this in my experience.
Side note: Always hold your shotgun before getting in ballers.

6. It is almost never correct to land on a baller, the only time this is a decent idea is if you are going to roll to some random no-name shit-tier loot spot.
Far too many times someone has rolled up to me after landing on a baller and I just kill them while they scramble for scraps.

7. If you find multiple ballers in their spawn point, launch them away by holding jump and exit simultaneously.
This way, less enemies will have ballers. Generally you can just send them anywhere out of sight and no one will find them.

8. Remember where all the ballers can spawn.
There are more places than just old expedition outposts that have ballers. 
Racetrack west of happy hamlet: 4 spawns
New expedition outpost in the jungle: 5(?) spawns
All pirate outposts have baller spawns: 2 (I think) spawns
Most of the small box expedition outposts now have ballers instead of quad-crashers
I am sure there are more new spots, comment below where some spots you have found are.

9. If you don't have a baller, most people keep theirs at the bottom of their 1x1 towers.
You break in grab it, and roll out.

10. While rotating late circles, make sure you are constantly hiding behind walls so that random players can't just beam your ball.
This is pretty obvious but I see players not do this all the time.

11. Late circle players usually ignore ballers and go for the players on foot instead. Use this to your advantage and roll behind them, get out, and one pump them.

12. If you are hiding in a tree, remember that players can hear the baller and shoot you from under the tree.

13. Stay in groups with other ballers, take the chance that on foot players will shoot the others over you.
Grappling other ballers usually is a show of friendship and understanding. By combining the power of multiple ballers you can do things that should not be possible. 
Side note: You are friends IF and ONLY IF all involved parties are in ballers. As soon as someone gets out of their baller they are no longer friendly until they return to their baller. 
Side side note: Don't team. As is said above, as soon as someone leaves their baller you are free to continue as you see fit, by either 1. Running/rolling or 2. Get out and shoot them. I recommend the first option as it is the only guarantee that you will survive longer.

14. If someone is in a turtle and starts shooting your baller, go bounce on all their shit.
They will start to panic and waste mats, and they usually get the message that they should leave you alone. 
Side note: if you see a baller breaking down builds, join them. The more havoc you can cause on the bouncer, the better.

15. Find places to camp where normal players can't go
If the circle goes of the map, you can attach to the side of the map and hang there indefinitely. If you are on the edge of the map, you can go where no others can follow by grappling the side of the island. 
If polar peak is in circle, the top of the castle is always safe from non-ballers, in my experience. If you encounter a fellow baller, make sure to attach to them to show you mean them no harm.

16. Stay close to the ground
Abusing momentum while rolling on the ground can prove to be faster than swinging and safer(because you won't die to fall damage if your baller breaks while on the move). Also there are players who get butt-hurt if you grapple up to their height, they will most definitely try and break your baller. This is also the best way to avoid accidentally grappling into the storm in small circles

17. While hiding with the baller, make sure to visit the TTV's and the twitch__ channels and tell them why you are visiting.
""Hey, I am in your game and just wanted to say good luck. I am in a baller so it's not like there is much else to do"" This gets a good laugh from everybody I have tried it on. Good way to liven up the game, and possibly make some friends along the way, while also making the day of the streamers, showing that some people come to their stream without being toxic at them.
Side note: Don't stream snipe, I search for the streamers on my phone and turn the streams to ""Only Audio"" so that I am not gaining knowledge of the players position.

18. Turn on auto-pick up
If you have auto-pick up on and you roll over materials that you can carry(leftovers from someone else's fight perhaps), it will automatically pick them up. Free mats!

19. Learn the different mechanics of a baller
For example, traps will trigger on empty ballers, and stick bombs do not damage the riders of ballers(use enemy stick bombs as a temporary hiding place late game)

If you hate the baller, and hate me for spreading useful knowledge about how to use the baller effectively, don't hate the player, hate the game.

Most of the time it's because they chose the building that looks the best after their glider opened.. ^(Or maybe they missed the building they were aiming for and had a perfect drop to another..) But at this point, everyone should know that the height you open your glider at is based on the ground below you. So to get the shortest flight, you have to aim for the lowest ground. 

So where are these low spots? Now with the ""Floor is Lava"" LTM, we can hop in the replay and let the lava raise up and find exactly where these little low ground pockets are around Tilted.

https://i.redd.it/44iwvocpnup21.png

Now keep in mind a lot of this depends on the bus line and how far away these spots are from it.. But if the line is going straight over or close to one of these spots, they are the lowest.. (Even to low for some buildings) .. Also keep in mind that loot usually spawns on every floor ^((Unless your a competitive match where you have everyone beat to your building yet somehow that guy that landed late and goes to the bottom floor of your building pulls the only pump in the whole entire building)) so with that being said, the lowest isn't always the best, but is generally a good guide to aim close to the areas.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks! If this is helpful, I can do more for other POIs. Tilted is a little different just because of how tall the buildings are, but I realized after I did this, this would benefit other POIs really well.

Please keep in mind that this list is made with competitive in mind, and let me know where you agree and/or disagree!

&amp;#x200B;

**Top Tier**

1) Happy Hamlet: With the 2nd most chest spawns of any POI, good mats, and two different nearby spots with 4 ballers apiece, this might be the most stacked spot in the game right now.

2) Sunny Steps: Solid loot, easy max mats, and you‚Äôre never more than a geyser away from a baller spawn.

3) Frosty Flights: You are pretty much guaranteed to leave here with a baller &amp; great loot. Mats are a different story, so you‚Äôll have to farm as you go.

4) Lonely Lodge: Decent loot, great mats, mushrooms for guaranteed shield, and tons of ballers nearby to the west &amp; north.

5) Lazy Lagoon: Great loot, efficient mats, and a 75% chance of getting a baller from the ship. If one doesn‚Äôt spawn, you can geyser south to the pirate camp or east into the jungle to find one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Mid Tier**

6) Pleasant Park: Solid loot, solid mats, and a pretty decent shot at getting a baller from the expedition outpost on the hill.

7) Polar Peak: Great loot, great wood &amp; brick, but lacking in metal. You have a chance at the balls at the nearby expedition outpost, but you‚Äôll be racing people from a few areas to get one.

8) Paradise Palms: Great loot &amp; mats, and the new coconuts mean shield should pretty much be guaranteed if you hit enough trees. Ballers might be tough to come by, but check the bridge.

9) Shifty Shafts: Decent loot, great mats, &amp; mushrooms. You have a decent shot at a baller from the nearby pirate camp or a single spawn in an AIM hut on the hill.

10) Dusty Divot: Solid loot, great wood &amp; metal, and enough mushrooms to guarantee shield. You should have a decent shot at a baller at the pirate camp, but move fast or it‚Äôll be gone.

11) Tilted Towers: You probably won‚Äôt be getting your hands on a baller, but Tilted is still home to the best loot in the game, tons of materials, and a nice centralized spot on the map.

12) Fatal Fields: Solid loot and easy wood &amp; brick, but metal is sparse. You should get second dibs on the baller at the pirate camp on the hill.

13) Retail Row: Great loot, solid mats, and fairly centralized. But in the baller meta, there aren‚Äôt any great ways to get one from Retail, preventing it from being higher on the list.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bottom Tier**

14) Haunted Hills: Mediocre but efficient loot, great mats, and a few nearby mushrooms. There are a couple ways to rotate to ballers, but your odds of getting one aren‚Äôt the best in either case.

15) Junk Junction: Similar to Haunted, but with a little less loot, less efficient brick, &amp; only one realistic rotation to get a baller.

16) Snobby Shores: Solid loot &amp; mats, with a few mushrooms to the north. Unfortunately, your odds of getting a baller at the nearby pirate camp aren‚Äôt the best.

17) The Block: Tough to evaluate since it‚Äôs always changing, but generally these tend to have great mats but bad loot. You should have a good shot at a baller on the mountain after a quick zipline.

18) Lucky Landing: Solid loot &amp; mats, but basically no chance of getting a baller, which is unfortunate since you might find yourself with a marathon rotation.

19) Loot Lake: Great loot, but that loot is in the middle of a wide-open killing field, and there are few mats to defend yourself with. Getting a baller from the Dusty pirate camp is iffy at best.

20) Salty Springs: Mediocre loot, solid mats, and a central location, which is good since you are nowhere near a baller. I‚Äôve never understood why it‚Äôs so popular, even before the baller meta.",FortniteCompetitive

With both Solos/Duos receiving Arena platforms that were desperately needed, I believe Squads should of received the same treatment.  If they wanted to just test and not include Squads in the World Cup that is fine, since you want to see if it would work first.

The argument most make when Competitive Squads comes up (no specific order):
1. Takes No Skill
2. Not Entertaining
3. End Game Lag would be miserable.


All three of those common arguments in MY OPINION is not true.  It does take skill for 4 people to clear out their landing spot, collectively loot, outfit the squad, patch up health, and start your rotations.

As for it not being entertaining, I make the argument that Solo and Duo are popular competitive because of the lack of competitive play or way to display squad matches for streaming and ‚Äòfortnite fridays‚Äô in the beginning.  Now that epic has their broadcast tools which are pretty sweet, and now with the arena modes to record it all, it can be done the way Solo and Duo was done.  3rd Circle and 4th Circles would not be as packed as Solo‚Äôs and Duo‚Äôs which turns into turtle wars, which is entertaining in it‚Äôs own way.  Late game, there will also be some turtle play but not as much because it would come down more towards attack plans and tactics.  Flanking a squad, or having a sniper get an angle for a first knock, then once getting that knock everyone comes over the top.

Personally, I find solos boring.  Duo‚Äôs are fine, I like duos too.  But Squads, i just love the group collaborative effort you have to maintain to secure the wins, and would be very entertaining.",FortniteCompetitive

I can prove this. When you do horizontal stretched res, the sides are cut. Therefore, the game tries to fill it. When the sides are cut, the aspect ratio. If you fit in a 16:9 square into a horizontal stretched res before the actual stretching, you will see that there is space up and down.So, you see more things, up and down. 

However, with vertical stretched res, the top and bottom are cut. Therefore, when you fit a 16:9 square, you see more at the sides.

Arguably, seeing more at the sides is better. You can see more from peeking corners, spot more enemies (because the map is usually flat) and generally have better awareness.

If you do want to try this, try a milder res. Like 900x1920. 720x1920 made me nauseous and gave me a headache for the better part of a day.

Why shouldn't an above average or even top 5% or higher player have an easy time ranking up till near the top rank? That's how legitimately every ranked system works. Of course it wont be good practise playing against the equivalent of cardboard 5 players in league but it doesn't take long to reach your skill level. What I think should be said is that the casual player (~0.9 kd 1~3% WR) will have a hard time playing in the 100-200 range even though from our perspective it feels like pubs.

What in my eyes could be experimented on is making placement games similar to rocket league, CS:GO, league of legends. It would start players of in around the middle of the bunch in terms of MMR and you would either gain or loose points depending on performance (at an increased pace compared to normal) after being placed in the respective division it would play out like it does now, the only thing I would change is add buss fare of -2 across all divisions so to not inflate the amount of people in one division.",FortniteCompetitive

This is because 100% of players who play arena will end up in div 4 purely through grinding. Those with a kd &gt; 1 or a placement average &gt; 25 will end up in div 5 or 6. This makes NO sense. The point of arena mode is to play against people of similar skill level. At this rate, the over inflation of points will EVENTUALLY lump all the players together in these lobbies, because players can‚Äôt lose points until division 4. This will allow players to consistently play against players of a similar skill level and actually make ranked mode make sense. This benefits BOTH good players and bad players. 

Division 1-3 will eventually have a player base of 0. This is HALF of all the divisions. It will rely purely on new players joining or trying to mode to actually get any use - where someone who may be at a similar skill level to a new player would already have grinded into div 4 just by playing a lot.

I agree with fortnite about putting the dou in a lobby of the player with the highest points but i dont believe your solo rank should determine your dous rank. Dous is more about player chemistry, callouts, and playing like a team which is 100% different then a solos game so they shouldnt be judged the same IMO.

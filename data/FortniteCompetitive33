&amp;#x200B;

Personally I don't think the hand cannon is balanced.  The damage to people is fine but it is used like a double pump. I don't think it should be able to break walls that are fully built. Timing your shots for when a person is building is an effective strategy that is totally valid. but if a wall is fully built I shouldn't be able to shot once and get a replace or break into your 1x1 and pump you within half a second. Doing that with a heavy snip is fine because there is a reload cool down. With the had cannon I can spam your walls and get a replace or tag you with a pump. I think it could use a little Nerf. 

&amp;#x200B;

There was a clip on here the other day of chap (i think) getting a squad wipe with the hand cannon pump combo. That's not easy to do but it not impressive either. I personally think its lazy and more of an exploit than a balance part of the game. I think it is loved so much by high level players because it allows them to pub stomp like the old days when everyone else sucked. Now that defaults are harder to come by sweats need this to still get the same amount of Kills/wins. Not saying chap and other pros or high level players NEED this to be good, but i do think it is overused as it is one of the best combos to run right now so why wouldn't people use it.  Not calling anyone out just want to know others opinions. 

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for others thoughts on the hand cannon but ill also take a sea of downvotes. ",FortniteCompetitive

First off they didn‚Äôt reduce the rate of gliders and balloons being dropped as floor loot. So we are not going to see any difference in floor spawn shield other than the switched rates of mini to big shield

And as for chest: 

The loot pool for the heals and utility section of a chest spawn have to equal 100% when all the items drop rates are added together. 

If the drop the rates on balloons and gliders together has been reduced by 11.8%

Wouldn‚Äôt that make the new item have an 11.8% drop rate and the shield drop rate would be the same? 

The only change with the shield is swapping the rate of mini and big shields. 

But without increasing the rate and then adding a new item we won‚Äôt actually be getting any more shield, they just make it seem like we will by saying ‚Äúshield fixes‚Äù. When in reality all they changed was us getting more mini shields which are now much worse, and getting less big shields. ",FortniteCompetitive

Especially in a competitive gamemode, its even harder to find people that constantly play with you on the same level or even have the time to invest 5 hours of their ""prime-time of the day"" into a limited pop up cup. It was frustrating to see the cup start yesterday and not being able to play the whole time due to the lack of teammates. I assume many players that are interested in ranked are solo players and players in general are so different from  each other regarding age, work etc. that a set time for an event will throw many people under the bus.

I just don't see the need of these two spawn possibilities. 

Starting with ammo: in every chest there is ammo as well as the weapon that uses it. 
Also ammo boxes are there for a reason, you just have to open them.

And with mats it's pretty much the same. You get 20 mats in every chest and you can farm 99% of the map to get mats, so getting an extra 20 mats on the floor, which decreases the chance of finding a useful gun or shields, seems to be not really neccessary for me. Sure some quick extra 20 mats might save you in early game in rare situations, but I prefer to have a higher chance of finding guns or shields.

I'd really love to see those changes, because it would definitely help with early game rng, even if it's just a little bit.

Here are my stats after about 3-4 weeks on PC:

note: duo/squad games i have to play with my bad console friends as i have no pc friends lol so w/l rates should be higher.

[https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Guibe%20el%20Haitian](https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/pc/Guibe%20el%20Haitian)

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I am here as I really have an interest in attaining skill in the game and competitive play and am not a casual. I tend to stick to one game intensely and get really good at it for a long period of time instead of constantly rotating games.

&amp;#x200B;

So it all began when I posted this video yesterday on r/FortNiteBR...

[https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ai6ojs/i\_went\_afk\_for\_20\_seconds\_and\_i\_came\_back\_at\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/ai6ojs/i_went_afk_for_20_seconds_and_i_came_back_at_the/)

&amp;#x200B;

I was surprised to see it blow up. Reading through the comments, many were of jokes, and others of how much of a ""sweat/tryhard"" I was over this clip... and what did I do? quick stair edit and traps?

&amp;#x200B;

Some of the golden responses: 

&amp;#x200B;

"" I‚Äôm just saying if you‚Äôre afk and someone aims at you and doesn‚Äôt even shoot, you don‚Äôt have to build a giant castle and then spam them""

&amp;#x200B;

""I am sure he is referring to the excessive editing.""

Next clip: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aiiap6/how\_to\_outplay\_someone\_with\_10\_wood/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/aiiap6/how_to_outplay_someone_with_10_wood/)

&amp;#x200B;

""Soccer skin, stretched res, try hard I wouldn‚Äôt ever take advice from that""

&amp;#x200B;

""Holy sweat""

""Haha stupid sweat... ok smelly chair""

&amp;#x200B;

Now I don't care what bots think of me however to some degree it gets annoying getting pissed on for... being good? lol. It's insane to me how people are so quick to denounce any player for being good as ""tryhard"" and such but then pull up mrsavagem, mongraal, or any other player and wet themselves (not a diss to those players i fucking love them too lololol).

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fully sticking to this sub. While the bots over at r/FortNiteBR want tanks, double turrets on planes, and fuckign helicopters the real dedicated fanbased over here is where the real strength of fortnite lies, and really of any game. On the good players.

As of right now I'm amazed by tfues play style the most. He's the person that makes insanely mechanical plays look so simple. The way he combines different mechanics and executes plays is super fluent but very very effective. What I also noticed is that he doesn't rush things when pub stomping, he doesn't necessarily do max speed 90's, flawless flashy quick edits but he makes it work better than even most pros.

His slowed down and methodical way of tearing up any opponent is why I started watching specifically him to learn from. ",FortniteCompetitive

In the GameUserSettings file (C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\FortniteGame\Saved\Config\WindowsClient), there is a setting labeled *sg.FoliageQuality* under the [ScalabilityGroups] options. I have all my settings on low and was confused why this was set to 1 while every other setting was set to 0. 

So I set this option to 0 and booted up the game and now have a steady ~144 fps (not including when gliding or in areas with a lot of builds) when I would usually hover at ~100 fps. The best part is I really can't tell any difference visually. I'm guessing it has to do with not rendering the foliage at much?

101,bennyboy82,1548078981,aiaaxg,36,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aiaaxg/how_scoring_should_work_in_ranked_mode_the_kelp/,1,How Scoring Should Work In Ranked Mode - The K.E.L.P. Method,"There have been a few pretty kickass designs for what a ranked mode would asethetically look like. However, all the scoring systems in Epic's tourneys were broke as fuck, and ranked mode would be stupid without... well... good rankings. 

So I came up with a relatively simple scoring model that I think works pretty well at both low and high levels of play. 

**K.E.L.P.** (short for Kills and Eliminations plus Logarithmic Placements, also I wanted an acronym that didn't sound like the nerdiest shit ever.)

Here's the equation:

SCORE = 5*((0.33*KILLS)-(LOG(PLACEMENT))+2*WIN+1.369)

Here are how a few sample games would turn out in this formula:

**Good**

Mega-Pubstomp - 20 kills, 1st place. +50 trophies

Pubstomp - 11 kills, 2nd place. +23 trophies

A Pretty Good Competitive Game - 2 kills, 10th place. +5 trophies

**Average**

A Mediocre Game - 1 kill, 50th place. 0 trophies

I Dropped Tilted - 2 kills, 85th place. 0 trophies 

**Bad**

oh shit oh fuck he got the shotgun - 0 kills, 90th place. -3 trophies

 **My Thoughts**

I think this system allows players to very quickly get up to their skill level, with so many trophies being awarded for stomping the lobby. Since the penalty for losing is so (comparatively) low, getting tilted and having some shit games won't hurt too badly. 

But at the top level, tiny moments will be key. Winning games is an automatic +10 trophy boost - with leaderboards packed so tightly with diminishing trophy returns in more competitive games, every win or second place will matter. Good placement isn't so much rewarded as bad placement is punished - even if you can't seem to get a kill, surviving to 23rd place ensures that you won't lose trophies. 

As a result of the logarithmic placement equation, every endgame kill becomes subsequently more important - the difference between 10th and 5th place is the equivalent of a whole kill. It creates a late-game conundrum - play aggressively and risk death for the shot at a kill and a few more points added onto your score, or play passive and try to wait it out for the win? 

The coefficient at the end of the equation is just a balancer. It's there to make a perfectly average game - 1 kill, 50th place - result in a net gain of 0 trophies. 

Players who don't want to fit the meta playstyle have options as well. Getting 3 kills and placing 90th still nets you 2 trophies. Hot dropping is a risk, but it can be one worth taking, especially for lesser-known players looking to make noise on the upper leaderboards. 

**If anyone has ANY questions or issues with how the formula would work, comment and I'll be sure to reply. I would write out more about the flaws w/ my system and explain how every part of the formula works, but I'm pretty tired right now so I'm not going to. ",FortniteCompetitive

With how hard it is to win solos or even a duo, casual players needed to find a way to have fun without stressing to get a dub. The big time modes take over almost all the casual player base and that‚Äôs why Solos, Duos and sometimes Squads are filled with sweaty TTV‚Äôs everywhere.

This ltms have divided the player base in such a way that we‚Äôre starting to see a difference. Back in older seasons everyone just play solo, duo and squads, no big team modes and that‚Äôs probably why the game was so enjoyable before, cause the balance of good and bad players was perfect.

I think I could have better stats but I've been purposely putting myself in challenging situations to try to get better (such as solo squads and dropping tilted the majority of the time) so I die a lot. 

any time I manage to get a squad together of people that have similar stats as me, we pop off and go on winstreaks. but the thing is usually when I do, people leave after the first match if it goes poorly. Also I get rejected from LFG posts (presumably because of my stats not being super impressive) even though the LFG host has similar stats as mine. Sometimes I wind up with teammates who start arguing with eachother or shitting on eachother if the peson they're spectating misses a shot. 

It's just frustrating, tonight I spend an hour and a half just trying to get a team together and I only got 5 matches in. I feel like I should have just done solos or solo squads, but since I can tell I've gotten a lot better I wanted to play some actual squads and get some easy wins. tonight people just kept leaving, even if they were the ones dying first, and rejecting me from LFG posts even when we have similar stats... Honestly I think most people just want to be carried. The most annoying part is I know they're also having a hard time getting a squad together because after they leave I see them posting LFGs.

All I want is to play with people who are my skill level and not toxic. I feel like that's not much to ask, but it's a consistent problem I have. is there a discord server that's more reliable than xbox LFG posts? what has been the best way to find teammates in you guys's experience?

Now, I know that this isn‚Äôt exactly new news but I have a new take on why the game has turned for the worse. The game is flooded with players at the moment and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it wasn‚Äôt the only game that most people play daily. This makes for more skilled players playing the game. This morning I logged onto Fortnite and played five rounds before getting tired of the game. I had landed salty springs and to be honest it had felt more like a death match round of call of duty than a BR game. I think that at this point we all have to understand that Fortnite is no longer the casual players game like it once was. It has become a very intense feeling game with all of the player improvement. So the main community is probably already frustrated because the game is so much harder and then you have epic games throwing things like planes and boom boxes into the mix. If Fortnite was still a relatively casual game to play I‚Äôm sure that boomboxes and planes would be widely accepted but it‚Äôs not. Fortnite is a game dominated by moderate to amazing players and Epic games needs to start treating it that way. I‚Äôm afraid that if they don‚Äôt accept that most people don‚Äôt think of it in a casual light anymore then the game will slowly decrease in popularity.            
Players will get bette rand epic will continue to draw in new players with silly and ridiculous game ideas that only annoy the veteran players more and more. There is no space in Fortnite for both casual and committed  players at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

This text will be write from a software engineer/game designer perspective about the actual problem of the game, the way i think Epic Games is trying to fix it, and the way of we (the competitive community) are reading Epic Games moves.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.- The problem**: In competitive matches is very common to see a lot of people in very small circles, this causes 3 other subproblems:

&amp;#x200B;

**1.1.-** From a software engineer perspective: This affect performance, in a very small place there's thousands of petitions to the server. Every wall, floor, ramp, roof and player needs to update his state and then this information is sended to every player in the game, this causes laggy situations hurting the gaming and viewer experience.

Even with this problem is very impressive how fast the server react to many buildings and players.

The sollution is not about ""buy better servers"", i dont know if a better server would solve this problem because i dont know if we have the technology to handle with this case in particular because none of us knows how fortnite is coded.

This problem doesnt occur in pubs because if you're on lucky landing, you are not sending/receiving information about what is happening in retail row.

Its all about quantity of information that every player send and receive.

As higher is the popullation of players in small zones, higher is the number of request/responses to the server, and higher is the lag.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.2.-** The second problem is that it hurts the viewer experience, for someone who dont play fortnite or play it casually, its kinda weird seeing a lot of players in 1x1 boxes, and its not interesting and not funny to watch, unless you play the game.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.3.-** The third problem is because of how bad the server performance is, its very frustrating for players, because of the laggy situations we all know.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**2.- How Epic Games is trying to solve this problem:** every item added is to massive destroy builds, they dont know how to handle against turtling in last circles, if you ever played scrims or watched pro games, you can see that everybody is turtling, because its the safest way to be the last survivor and the winner (And its okay, thats the objective in a Battle Royale game)

Epic thinks that adding anti turtling items (sword, boombox, dynamite, planes, zombies, etc) are going to finish with turtling, but they're wrong, the only thing that this causes is unfair advantage to the player who have these items, and not always wins the best.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.- ¬øSo, are you telling me that the weird items are not added to decrease skill gap, or make casuals happy?:** Yes, this way of thinking is a collateral effect of the ""Against turtling policy"". Because this affect only to good players, and not to bad players (casuals dont build a lot, they dont turtle, they just wanna shot with each other because they don't know how to build).

&amp;#x200B;

**4.- The impact of the problem in a possible ranked mode:** I think a ranked mode is very far from us, because if they wanna give a good competitive gaming experience, first they need to solve this problem, im very convinced that ranked isn't in their plans until the competitive games are fair enough at server performance for everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

**5.- ¬øHow to fix the problem?:** The way that Epic is trying to fix the problem isn't correct, it only causes frustration for the competitive playerbase, i think they need to rethink the way to solve the problem, from ""*What can we do to make people kill each other on last circles*"" to ""*What can we do to get fewer players alive as the game advances*"".

&amp;#x200B;

This text have many assumptions, because Epic games doesnt comunicate a lot with the competitive community, but from a software engineer / game designer perspective it have some sense.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR;** I think all the changes are not oriented to make casuals happy, they're oriented to solve high popullation on small circles problem, They dont want to decrease skill gap, they want to improve server performance and improve viewer experience.

It was super fun, and probably a big part of the reason I liked fortnite so much. The thing is, as time passed, the developers kept trying to nerf PvP and make it more focused on good content. The PvP slowly started to die out, and it's sad to see Fortnite go down this path. The Epic developers are trying to appeal to casuals and push out more content and destroying the competitive community. Also, game breaking bugs like the ice glitch are still in.

Many of us are desperately wishing for a *separate* (from normal pubs) Ranked mode. Will we eventually get that, or not? Being left hanging is even worse than being told that something you want isn't going to happen. Because then you can either make peace with it and accept it, or not, but either way - you move past it and put it behind you.

The game has been tedious and not-fun before, but it has peaked with 7.20 , Planes still exist, hunting rifles are unnacurate as fuck, They add zombies... AGAIN. 

They add one gun that is perfectly accurate and guess what? IT ISN'T OP, but they think that adding skill weapons hurts the game because ""casuals and bots will not play anymore"". They don't want to play anymore, but this is the only game that is currently available (Battlefield V, COD, Rainbow, ALL MODERN GAMES ARE AT A SHITTY STATE).

Listen to me epic, YOUR GAME WILL DIE **Unless** you guys do something about it now.

Keep double pump, it takes a huge amount of skill to hit 2 consecutive high accuracy shots at someone who is jumping around you constantly, it's fun, it gets countered by something as simple as placing one wall. 

Add fun things! Guess what? Fun KEEPS the noobs and pros Happy alike! Fun things are: High skill weapons, Consistency, Live events (that don't include zombies) and last but not least, NO BUILDING-DESTROYING ITEMS (Boom boxes, Planes, etc).

Want to keep bots alive? 50v50 or large team modes! Want to keep pros happy? Give us pop up cups! Want to prevent pub-stomping? Add a skill based Match Making System.

It's not that hard epic, but the only good decision you've made in the past 2 months is double pump, WHICH WAS AN ACCIDENT! 

By the way, to those of you who remember double pump being op, here are the facts why it's not: 

1.People can build now

2.Shotguns no longer do full damage to structures

3.There are no shields in the game anymore, so you would die to the first pump anyways.

4.If you get killed by double pump spamming, chances are you would have lost to that guy anyways since it's not hard to keep them at a distance double-pump proof.

Being tired of racking my brain over this shit, I‚Äôm just going to gather up all the things that I believe are wrong with this game right now. Less controversial stuff first.

-Planes (low risk, high reward. Easy to 3rd party. Spawn at various locations all over the map. Take literally no skill to use) 


 -No ranked playlist. Tired of pubs. Would be easy for an AAA company to implement a system like the one Overwatch &amp; R6S have. Pretty baffling. 
 
 -Low chance of shield spawning. (This one seems pretty blatant, by my count Smoke Grenades, Gliders, Scoped ARs &amp; balloons were all added to the blue or green rarity pool at the same time.) the week before this change shield was everywhere &amp; most times I was walking around at 200 


 -Editing. (Edit delay. Editing sensitivity being build sensitivity. Its extremely hard to control on console since it needs to be high to build how I need to). Editing is one of the most important game mechanics and it‚Äôs scuffed, not much else to say.  


 -Content updates taking precedence over bug fixes and QoL changes. This one hurts because like the shield spawn decrease it seems blatant. Why can‚Äôt things that are heavily upvoted and heavily detailed in both subs on twitter and anywhere else this game is talked about be fixed? People constantly gimped by ziplines, Turbo building still bugged. Pump pullout delay when only carrying one. Walls &amp; floors placing below ground. Ghost shots from pump. Many more I‚Äôm forgetting.


-Pump body shots. On console, at close range, it‚Äôs extremely easy to just turn ADS and with the help of aim assist hit a 9 pellet body shot. I think the 2.5 headshot multiplier should come back and have headshots be more rewarding. Body shots feel too strong right now. 


 - The Deagle should not be able to break freshly placed metal. 


 -The pacing of solos. Mid game in solos is nonexistent. No ones alive. If you hot drop you‚Äôll for the most part come out of it with little to no shield and hardly any extras to stack. If you cold drop you‚Äôll see 2-3 players on your landing and probably won‚Äôt see another one for a while. I grind solos as I don‚Äôt have a lot of people I enjoy playing with. Both ways to go about it seem unrewarding and boring. Only way to run into more people seems to be to use a vehicle. 


The purpose of this post is to organizes these thoughts &amp; to open a discussion about this stuff. I‚Äôve seen similar complaints here a bunch. I don‚Äôt want to attack Epic or anyone‚Äôs play style. Let me know what I missed, what you disagree with and what you think could be done. For me it‚Äôs simple. All content updates must stop in favor of balancing the game &amp; implementing a ranked playlist.

I think so...,"This is almost going to sound like a conspiracy, but I‚Äôm fairly certain something is going on here. Yet again Epic decides to role out a game breaking mode for all regular modes without adding a normal solos or duos. Both communities (Comp + FortniteBR) decided they hated Fortnitemares and it‚Äôs been marked as one of the worst patches to date. Before this event it was well noted that shield were almost nonexistent even for those with high kill games. Now after this fortnitemares-like event their are zombies the supply the demand for shields. Now all of their are a ton of streamer dishing on the same line of.. ‚ÄúZombies give shields = good update‚Äù included are Tfue, Vivid and Poach just to name a few. 

Not saying all these streamers could have formed the same opinion, I‚Äôm just surprised most of them didn‚Äôt think of other ways to solve this... like having shields revert to their previous drop %. Either way, the whole thing seems a little fishy and it‚Äôs quite obvious these people accept money for endorsements considering that‚Äôs the bulk of a most big content creators income. All I‚Äôm saying is the thing seems a bit manufactured. This was obviously a terrible update and very fortnitemares-esque. A update even casual players didn‚Äôt enjoy (aside from Redeploy).

Zone 5 goes uphill to simulate a hard rotation that happens in scrims. There are 20 spawn pads total. Each spawn box has a chest which consist of shields, Weapons that are used in scrims, no quad launcher/rpg/grenade launcher, you do get a choice of 5 grenades, 5 sticks, or 5 clingers (I have tested it out with some friends and it works perfectly). In the chest you also spawn with 500 mats of each type and enough ammo to get you through the battle! At the moment, i run viewer games with my buddy Jacob. we don't get an insane amount of viewers  but our communities come together and have amazing creative games. We do these by hopping in our community discord server. We don't jump on the launch pads until everyone has their load out. Since some people take longer than others i made a little parkour course in the waiting area. Once everyone is ready I then do a countdown in the discord call (3,2,1,go) and on go everyone jumps on the launchpad down to zone 1. Zone 1 and 2 are 1 minute and 30 seconds. In the discord call i will let you know when you have 30 seconds left, 10 seconds left, then i countdown ""3,2,1 rotate to the next zone."" there are 3 lamas with meds and mats in zone 1 and 2 (since you spawn with 500 mats of each type). Zone 3 has 2 lamas and Zone 4 has 1 lama. I feel like I might be missing something so if you have any questions on concerns please let me know. I also feel like this map or this type of game mode in creative has a lot of potential.

Let me go over my opinion of this update.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Good**

First of all, the visibility seems like it's doodoo, but there's a lot of good things about it. 3rd partying is WAYYYY down, which was my main criticism of the current pub meta. Less visibility makes it difficult to spot players out of planess and high up in the sky when you rift. 

The monsters spawn way less than Fortnitemares, and don't build up like they did in Fortnitemares. End games are definitely playable now, and there aren't just monsters disrupting you EVERYWHERE. They still can be disruptive, but they're much easier to handle. 

The monsters seem much less noisy. I can usually hear what's going on around me. I'm not sure how it compares to when they updated Fortnitemares to be less noisy, but it seems much better than what I remember

The monsters give this game a much needed shield boost. I am confident I can quickly get to 200 hp/shield in less than a minute now, and it makes the game way more playable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Bad**

The visibility is really annoying at medium range in certain areas. It makes it difficult to aim in many cases. I wish they implemented the ice storm differently, so it limited only long range visibility, but short range was unchanged. 

The monsters are just more noise pollution to this already noise polluted game. Seriously, is this amount of constant noise even OK for young kids' ears?

Some monsters have ranged attacks. Seriously? Probably the most annoying thing about them. When I'm running away from a spawn, I've started placing walls behind me because it's so annoying. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Overall Feeling**

Honestly, it makes the game more playable to me. Having shield is an amazing feeling. Getting 3rd partied less is an amazing feeling. This more than makes up for the bad things it introduces to the game IMO. I'm sure people will disagree. Additionally, I am in no way recommending Epic find a solution to their shield/3rd partying problem by keeping these monsters in the game. It should be an alarm to them just how unplayable the game was before, but I'm sure they won't think of it that way.

People were already complaining about third partying and zombies are just making it worse. Whenever you get close to zombies they follow you until you manage to escape/kill them, this makes it so that everyone know your location.

People were complaining last time you brought zombies into the game and still you haven't done anything different this time.

Zombies are fun the first few games but they get really annoying after a while.

Games like CS:GO have tons of really cool mechanics like crouch jumping and bunnyhopping which makes the game really fun to play, but Epic Games for Some reason doesn't want Fortnite to have these kind of mechanics. For example, they removed bunnyhopping. The double pump glitch is great because it takes atleast some skill to do, just like the csgo mechanics.
It also adds a clear difference between skilled and non-skilled players: you have to do it perfectly to do it consistently, which some players can't do, and they have to practice it, making practice more fundamental.

My duo partner is really toxic. He's a great player and a super nice guy (as well as my IRL friend) and we have great chemistry. The issue is, whenever he dies he:

1. Blames it on the game, always

2. Leaves match, most of the time (75%?)

He refuses to change even though I keep asking him, and when we do tourneys/pop up cups he acts like I'm being ridiculous for not wanting to continue playing w/ him even though he doesn't watch me play it out. 

He also constantly spam invites me to play, which I would usually jump at the chance to do, but even since he started pulling this shit I don't really want to join him anymore. It's like playing with a really skilled toddler.

First of all, I can't believe that they aren't making it an LTM or a seperate playlist, instead they're replacing traditional solos/duos/squads. I thought that the developers would be smart enough to learn from their past mistakes. Maybe i'm wrong but I feel as though Fortnitemares drove away a lot of the players that value this game and take it relatively seriously. I know for me personaly I didn't enjoy it whatsoever. 

In my opinion Fortnitemares is the second worst addition to Fortnite ever so far, only behind the tragedy that was the Infinity Blade. I'd rather get rammed and smashed by planes a million times over than have to deal with this zombie shit. They just add an annoying element to the game even when there's already so many. 

I'm also very surprised that this is coming back because of how the majority of streamers complained about it. I don't think I heard one streamer/pro player say that they were having the time out their life during Fortnitemares. 

Unfortunately this isn't like the infinity blade though. The community uproared and complained about the infinity blade causing Epic to vault it and even apologize for adding it. But with this event, it's here to stay for however long Epic decides. No matter how much the community complains, there's no way in hell Epic removes it. We can only hope that they make regular playlists available.

BUT do you know why there won't be mass complaints? Because casuals loveeeeee this stuff man. And this game is for the casual player. I've said it over and over, I understand that Epic needs to cater to the casual to keep the game alive, but is stuff like this really the answer? Apparently because the casual player base is going to be so excited for this upcoming event.

Instead of a ranked playlist, we're getting our traditional playlists replaced with a playlist full of zombies and bullshit. I don't know how long the event will last, but I can already feel my desire to play Fortnite windling away. It's an absolute joke in my opinion. I haven't thought about playing another game in a very long time, but it might be time to look at some other options. 

I LOVE this game and i care about this game, but whats about to come... isn't Fortnite to me. Just my 2 cents",FortniteCompetitive

But I thought about it and it would make a lot of sense if OG skins (pls relax and hear me out) like the ghoul Trooper, Areal assault trooper, recon expert or the renegade raider would be buyable when reaching 300 and more wins (maybe go in 50 steps). The skins would still be rare and  a status symbol, and show that the player earned them and is good at the game. This would be way better than just rereleasing them in the item shop like many OG skins where. I chose those skins because I think these are the skins with the most prestige, but epic could of course make exclusive new skin only buyable if you have enough wins. There are many different ways this could be implemented, this threat is just meant to hopefully show Epic that the community would be interested in those rewards.

348,s-12,1547840559,ahe6hm,13,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ahe6hm/serious_fortnite_as_an_esport_is_hard_to_watch_as/,1,[SERIOUS] Fortnite as an e-sport is hard to watch as a casual. It's going to impact the potential growth for the scene.,"I'd like to have a discussion about fortnite as an e-sport. We all know that there is a VERY high skill ceiling and a low skill floor that separates the greats from the good and the mediocre. We know that the core mechanics can be made into a really enjoyable and competitive environment. Fortnite is a game where you can kill a dude 10/10 times if you're truly better than him, which is a staple in every great competitive game. However, at Fortnite's current state, there is a big issue (along with others) that may hinder its competitive scene and growth as an e-sport.  

&amp;#x200B;

 \&amp;nbsp; 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest issue: Fortnite is awful to watch unless you're a comp player. There are 100 players on the map in the beginning, and spectators will miss 75% of the action due to the camerawork focusing on someone like Ninja cutting down fences. We can tell that there's action, by just looking at the kill feed. As the camera pans on Tfue who's breaking down 7 house walls, the kill feed shows that 4 dudes just died and we just missed all that action.  

&amp;#x200B;

 \&amp;nbsp;  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

What turns competitive video games into great e-sports, is how easy it is to grasp while it's spectated by the casual audience. I know this subreddit hates casuals, but as a successful e-sport, the competitive product should be easily spectated to casual audiences. As a casual, I can watch a game like Street Fighter or Smash and see exactly what's going on, and I can grasp amazing gameplay rather easily. A fps like CS is the best FPS out there for an e-sport. Everyone more or less gets access to the same equipment for a fair and balanced game. The objective is easy to understand and creates a very suspenseful environment. The ""skill"" shown in cs matches is crazy high and really easy to appreciate. Although mobas are hard to watch at first, all the action can be shown on camera and you can easily grasp the basics of team fighting, objective hunting, etc. All these great games have a similarity in their competitive product: how it can easily be watched by someone that hasn't even played the game. Watching skirmishes as a casual is kind of hard. You don't really understand what's going on half the time. You just see 40 dudes in the end-game circle dying. As someone who's played a lot of hours of fortnite, I understand what's going on and I really enjoy end-game circles. But if I was a casual, I'd have no idea on what's even going on.  

&amp;#x200B;

The point of having a good spectator game is so you can attract viewers to your tournament. E-sports are run by the casual audience. Without that audience, what's the point? It's just dudes playing a video game. Fortnite isn't the only big game out there that suffers from this issue. Overwatch is a great game but it's also hard to watch. Epic games has to find a way to make their product a great viewing experience, or change it, for the sake of the comp scene.",FortniteCompetitive

I landed paradise and realized these games were no joke. Every player who was invited/played were all good players. I don‚Äôt normally play scrims I usually stick with pubs. But my god the 2 times I made it end game it was much fun. I ended with 9 points after 20 games. Not the worse but not the best point total. The players I played against were definitely top tier and that‚Äôs what made it so fun but rage inducing at the same time. The amount of times I got outplayed so hard was crazy and a very good learning experience. I think as they said start branching out test tournaments to other players who were close to qualifying for pins.  I strongly believe this has made me see flaws in my game I wouldn‚Äôt been able to find in pubs. I‚Äôve seen many pro strats on this subreddit that was used against me. Overall getting mad as hell at this game this has provided me with a amazing experience thanks for adding this epic.,FortniteCompetitive

Maybe I don‚Äôt belong here but I‚Äôm sharing my opinion.
I‚Äôve been playing on mobile for 5 years as a competitor for multiple games.
Fortnite hasn‚Äôt done any tournaments for mobile. The highest revenue that they get its from mobile and they don‚Äôt support us at all. 
There are so many bugs that I am not going to mention.  We still don‚Äôt have a leaderboard to see our K/D  wins etc...
There was Winter Royale  tournament cross platform but there is no chance for a mobile player to get a place... we get like 5 FPS end games if there are 10-15 players moving circles. I have played pop up cups and was fun, highest points was 34 duo and I have 6 shiny pins. 
I‚Äôve been practicing a lot lately doing crims, playing cross platform but I think all the time that I spent isn‚Äôt worth anymore from what I see. 

Maybe you will say switch to pc or console.
As I said I‚Äôve been a game on mobile for 5 years touching the screen and it‚Äôs hard to change to pc or console. 
I hope you guys have a great time and good luck in the next competitive events.

I had the idea to give a ""radar"" of sorts for the initial bus drop only, maybe showing enemies on the map (only while they are diving out of the bus) until they are out of render distance and for a undecided maximum amount of time.

This would allow individuals/teams to spread out when they drop, avoid RNG heavy drops, and ultimately provide more players into the mid game as more POIs would have players rotating out of them.

In high-profile scrims, we know where the pros land. Tfue(mexico and now frosty), Nick in Tilted, etc... but for the standard scrims/pop-up cups, this is an unknown.  ",FortniteCompetitive

With that said however, if Epic insists on making the competitive scene cross-platform (which I definitely encourage), than there are some issues that put console players at a serious disadvantage which haven't been addressed. I am not talking about KB&amp;M vs. controller (which we shouldn't complain about, epic has done a great job in balancing a controller vs. KB&amp;M with aim assist and custom keybinds) or the higher framerate a PC can produce (again nothing we should be complaining about, better hardware gives you better performance, if you want a higher fps you should invest in a PC). It's the abscence of graphical settings for console (mainly being able to turn off shadows), not being able to customize res and the 'fog' that covers the BR map for console players but not for PC players (here is a thread about that, with an illustration: [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ah1qvf/how\_do\_u\_want\_ps4\_players\_upper\_image\_to\_be\_able/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ah1qvf/how_do_u_want_ps4_players_upper_image_to_be_able/)

I don't really understand why epic works on new weapons and items that nobody really cares about, but hasn't done anything about these problems. If there is a reason console players can't turn off shadows, than I think they should at least communicate about it. If the 'fog' that we've got since the latest patch is a bug, than why haven't they communicated about it like they've done with other bugs in the patch (like the dropping framerate when building)? Stretched res is another topic. I know epic doesn't want people to play on stretched res, but every semi-competitive PC player is going to use stretched res. So why not make an in-game option to customize res, so that it is accessible for everyone (including console players)?

During the pop-up cups, I got clapped by PC players and good console players in lobbies of 15/20 + points and I realized I had to get better. In the last month, I've been grinding hard trying to get better for upcoming in-game tournaments, and I've improved significantly. However, with the current graphics that I'm getting I don't see myself doing better than I did last month, which is discouraging. I'm in the process of getting a PC, but it will stake some time before that's built.",FortniteCompetitive

I used to get a ton of wins in the earlier seasons. I want to know what is going on with this game. Why doesn't it work for some of us and then there are people who literally don't get it and think the game is fine and have no issues building and bugs and think anyone who complains just sucks.

Game 1: Running out of the storm, drop off the cliff at tilted holding floor... nothing builds and I lose 70 health

Game 2: Hear somebody on the floor below at Lazy Links. Jump and build a ramp. The ramp doesn't build. He destroys the floor I'm on and shreds me.

Game 3: In a build battle. Ramp doesn't place over his even though I'm aiming right at it. Reroute, 180 degree turn around and walls don't place.

Game 4: Get stuck in edit, because the only viable button to have it on is thumb stick, and they're too sensitive when turning sharply.

Game 5: Hear somebody drop behind me. Go to edit the wall, but it won't let me. Get one shot through a window. And on that note I'm seemingly never able to get a clear angle through a window without an X marker.

I'm not even talking about winning money, but about having a fun and competitive experience where getting better is actually enjoyable because Epic tries to please the ones that love the more their game.

I won't make a list about every single garbage update and add, but right now the game is at an awful state, and Epic waited 1 month to tell us their "" part 1 competitive philosophy "" ( lmao guys, part 1 really ? ), which basically says they will keep changing the meta every two weeks and keep adding more and more stuff despites the feedbacks, but it's ok they said it in a very diplomatic way and pros will have more time to AdApT. :)

&amp;#x200B;

Most people say Epic keep their game casual because we are the 0.0001% but come on, but I truly think Epic are a bit lost about everything. At the moment they could do pretty much anything, even turn Fortnite more competitive, they wouldn't lose a single dollar because the game is on cloud nine.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day I see people here saying they're gonna quit and I'm sure we all thought about quitting because yeah Epic is fucking with us but guess what we won't do it. We invested so much time and love in Fortnite, that we would be devastated to be forced to quit. So we stay here, we keep complaining about epic doing what they do for actually months.

Every death was your own fault and you had some way to play it better.

* Rainbow Six Siege has TWO updates per season - one which is a balance patch, and the other being new content. 
* MOBA games occasionally add a new Hero/God/Etc. And they do balance patches (Which we are severely lacking over here)
* CS:GO, not a whole lot changing there either.

The point is, the game can still be fun to watch without adding a sword, or a plane, or a new weapon/item every single week. In the ""State of Competitive Fortnite"" Blog post, one of their concerns is keeping it interesting for spectators and players. I can guarantee you that 99% of the ""pro"" players want less updates, less items, and more time to prepare for a tournament when a new update comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

The obvious solution would be to create a game mode called ""Comp Fortnite"" that was used for Events, Tournaments, etc.

EPIC is the only company I have seen that completely neglects their competitive player base.

#Important: 

**[SkyzYn](https://old.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ah1dcq/new_popupcup/eeamtca/):**

&gt;As a heads up, not everyone will have access to this initially.  We've updated the backend which tournaments run on and want to slowly ramp up the amount of players as we verify that everything is working as expected as we scale up.  

&gt;If you don't see it (after a client restart), don't feel left out - we'll be adding additional people, regions, and testing sessions and we'll be back to regular nightly tournaments open to everyone very soon if all goes well.

&gt;The tournament will also be deleted upon completion - it's meant strictly for checking our new systems!

---

**Details:**

This tournament will self destruct at the conclusion of our testing period. Any scores or pins will be removed after the tournament is completed. 

We've updated our tournament systems and will be running a few small scale events to prepare for a wider release of upcoming features. Additional players will gain access to this tournament over time.

#Format: TBD

Either I'm the luckiest player in Fortnite or the ""problem"" is not nearly as great as people make it seem because I rarely go any game without finding shields.

Today HighDistortion made a tweet claiming ""shields are almost impossible to find now"". What the hell is he even talking about? I find shields in every game.

Do people say it's ""impossible"" just because they don't find shields in the first house they land on? Do you expect to have shields at all times or something? I don't get it. 

When I talk about this people tell me ""how about you land in Tilted and win the game playing aggressively?"". Uh, yeah I land Tilted sometimes, I play aggressive. But when I do I'm aware that this play style will lead to me needing more heals than usual. That's the downside of playing with zero strategy, rushing everyone always. Of course you will run out of fucking shields playing like this.

I don't even see how pros play like this? Is this entire discussion about senseless pub stomping? Because when I watch scrims nobody is going overly aggressive.

Honestly the whole ""crisis"" is blown so way out of proportions. Now that minis stack only to 6 I often even leave my POIs with leaving shields behind because I simply can't carry them. I have games where I don't find enough shields but it's maybe 1 in 10 games.

They make a living playing video games and carry a lot of weight within the game because of there 'supporters'. They place Epic in a difficult position by continuing to create divides within the community and critiquing the progenitor of their revenue stream. The game is skill plus rng, always has been.

477,rwoqXBL,1547700439,agu7jx,43,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/agu7jx/sheild_crisis/,1,Sheild crisis,"Epic, this is unacceptable.  There's no reason I should leave a hot drop with 5+ kills and have 75 or 100 health.  There's no reason I should 15+ kill finish games having never gone above 150 health.  There is a sheilds crisis in the game, and it seems to have been only heightened after the recent update.

First, Epic keeps adding uneccessary items that mess with the chest and sheild RNG.  A chest gives 1 weapon w/ ammo, mats, and 1 consumable (such as sheild, grenades, balloons, glider redeploy, etc.).  The problem is that the more consumables added to the inventory pool lowers the chance of getting sheilds.  This game is already too RNG as it as, but entering a fight with no sheild when some lucky sob found minis and a full pot is a huge disadvantage and ruins the fun.

Also, players are getting better, and it's a lot harder to leave fights without taking damage.  With Epic continuously adding stupid and OP weapons (boomboxes, planes, splodes, smh spray, etc.), it is near impossible to finish a kill without taking at least a bit of damage.  If that eliminated players didn't have sheild, then you're screwed.  Also, with the current 3rd party meta, you can't fight one guy without expecting to fight 2, 3, 4 more guys.  If someone nust mindlessly shredded all your sheild off and you're stuck fighting someone 200 health 0 kills, landed junk junction, it's not going to be a fun time.  People also feel the urge to snipe and chip your health away with ARs from 200m away when you're in a buildfight.

It's really getting out of hand now.  Not only is it hard to find sheild, but it is easy to lose sheild and easy to get pushes with no sheild.  We've known for a long time now that Epic is trying to lower the skill gap, but it's so frustrating for the people who put hours into the game.  Personally, pushing almost every fight and going for high kills is the only fun way to play the game, but it feels like Epic is encouraging landing in some deserted place, looting up sheilds and mats, ignoring most fights or at least not getting involved in them, and finally 3rd partying the final circle fights getting a win with 4 or less kills.  

There is a problem, but there are some easy ways to fix it.

1. Increase the drop rate of sheilds so people don't go into fights feeling vulnerable.  Even a bit of sheild makes more feel more confident pushing a fight.  This will help with early game, as well as midgame because there wil be more sheilds to carry.

2. I doubt this will happen because it is so requested and Epic still ignores (there's a surprise), but health per kill like the pop up cups.  This will probably be the easiest way to solve the problem and will be a huge step in the right direction.

3. Vault or nerd the stupid, uneccessary bot weapons. Some suggestions:

Vault:
Turret
Balloons
Tac
Either silenced or regular pistols, we don't ned both
Quad

Nerf:
Planes
Splodes

And most importantly, make building great again

Epic, we know you cater to the casuals and are constantly looking to put experienced players and bots on even playing fields, but hear our cries.  There are so many things wrong with this game in its current state. but buffing sheilds and health will remove or at least lessen those problems.",FortniteCompetitive

Sorry if there's a bunch of posts regarding quad launchers but the game has had this for how long yet it's this OP. Although I had low health and no mats and that seems to be my fault which I understand it technically is, a launcher that has 4 missiles (quick reload in my opinion as well) that explodes as soon as it lands is a much more OP grenade launcher. The last 2 people I faced each has a quad launcher which is part of the reason why I entered the fight with no mats and no health. Both of them spammed the weapon knowing it was too OP and honestly, it has to go, there's too many explosives in the game and RNG doesn't help either.

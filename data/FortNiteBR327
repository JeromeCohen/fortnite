*The old skins, the event skins, the OG skins*, whatever you'd like to call them, a matter of so many posts and clickbait videos on the platform we all know. Whenever one of these skins is mentioned an argument occurs, but the thing is... They **ARE** coming back, **every\-single\-one of them**, no exceptions. Do not believe anyone claiming they are not, be it a regular player, blogger, streamer or youtuber if he's not an *EPIC* Employee or somehow related to *EPIC*.

But before we delve a bit deeper. There are currently **4 types** of skins:

* Item Shop Rotation Item
* Event\-esxclusive
* Season\-exclusive\*
* Battle Pass\-exclusive

As you see EPIC's recently re\-introduced such skins as **Highland Warrior** \(Saint Patrick's Day event\-exclusive\) on** May 16, 201**8, Love Ranger alongside Cuddle Team Leader \(Both Valentine's Day event\-exclusive\)  on May 17, 2018 and after Wukong \(Chinese New Year event\-exclusive\) on May 23, 2018. It is unknown whether New Year's Day or Halloween skins will be coming back before their associated holidays and I can only speculate that they may come back a bit earlier.** ******************

Now for such high demand skins as **Skull Trooper**, **Red Knight**, **Power Chord** and many others it can be said that **YES, THEY WILL COME BACK**. **Skull Trooper** is not season\-exclusive or Battle Pass\-exclusive, but is considered to be holiday\-exclusive **Red Knight**\*\* is NOT season\-exclusive, although it follows the general theme of Season 2 \(Which is ""Knights""\) and it's actually an Item Shop Rotation Item \(there was a now deleted post on twitter adressing the issue\), just **as Power Ch**ord. 

And there are of course the skins that are not coming back and those skins are all Battle Pass/season\-exclusive, which include, but are not limited to **Sparkle Specialist**,** Black Knigh**t,** Rust Lor**d,** Reape**r,** Zoe**y and** Omeg**a. It's been stated by EPIC many a times and I presume they will stay faithful to their word, unless they want to cause huge backlash from the community.

\* I call them season\-exclusive since there are only 2 skins, 1 glider and 1 harvesting tool that are not a part of Battle Pass because there was no Battle Pass for *Season 1* but was an option to buy the skins from the store if you met a certain level requirement.**  Aerial Assault Troop**er**, Renegade Raid**er**, Aerial Assault O**ne an**d Raider's Reven**ge.  
\*\* It wasn't a part of Season 2 Battle Pass and was sold as an Item Shop Rotation Item for 2000 V\-bucks.

That would be the end of it, dear reader. Take care and await patiently if you desire one of those skins. \(I myself would actually like to lay my hand upon the precious Crackshot\)",FortNiteBR

I DON'T want to see 2 teams of pros on the SAME squad, battling to see who can kill more.  I come from CSGO, and that would be like pros playing matchmaking games and whoever gets more kills wins...I just don't like it.  I LOVE fortnite don't get me wrong, I don't want the regular game changed.

What I WOULD like is some kind of mode...2v2, 5v5, 10 v10...or teams of 2 times 10 or whatever.  THEN let the Pros FIGHT EACH OTHER...THAT is what I want to see not them on the same team unable to kill each other.  I LOVE Fortnite like I said, but I watch more CSGO because I feel like it is more of an esport right now.  I would love to see some special ""esport mode"" or ""comp mode"" where pros would play head to head vs other pros killing each other, not who can kill more random ppl.  It would make it way more interesting IMO, and make it much less random.

PLZ don't down\-vote just for an idea...if you have a DIFFERENT idea on how fortnite competitive could be improved as an esport plz post it, or elaborations, suggestions or changes to my idea.

TLDR:  I want to see pros vs pros, and I would love some special esport mode, like 10\-30 teams of 2, or 5\-20 teams of 4 on squads or something, and make them fight each other not just be on same team battling for kills only. ",FortNiteBR

We split screened through dozens of games on my old Xbox 360 and had the time of our lives. But as my brother grew older and moved to college, a void has been left.

He has less time to play games with me and I had missed spending time with him. I’ve never been the closest with my parents either, so when he left for college it really left me feeling alone.

When FortNite came out, this dynamic changed. Since FortNite became such a pop culture phenomenon, it pulled my brother back into gaming. We started playing together again, and since then I’ve regained that bond that we lost a couple years ago (and we’ve won 12 times :))

I will be PM’ing each of the winners to work out how to get their 1000 V Bucks each. I decided to go from one large winner to 5 smaller winners so we can get more winners in the community. 

I do apologize for the length of time it took to get this post out. I have been very busy and very sick so I barely had time to get this out. Thank You again to everyone that participated and let’s hope we can see some positive changes from this in the community and the game.

Any noob could get lucky and headshot with a shotgun from close range.

Potential balance changes could be:

Purple Semi-Auto Sniper:
- Increase Body shot to 67 (3 shot body shot, so it’s still not as good as a bolt)
- Increase Head shot to 201 (Triple the body shot)

This would increase the usage of Semis, as most people aren’t fond of them and need a Bolt.

Green Pump Shotgun:
- Keep Body shot the same (90)
- Decrease Head Shot to 180 (Double the body shot)

Lot's of the other so called challenges are just ""Go here, go there"" and I know a lot of you guys just use SquatingDog's Challenge Guide. No hate on him or anything, he does good work that I'm sure is very helpful to some people, but again in my opinion challenges should be challenging. Not searchable.

I'd personally like to see more challenging challenges, one's that people can't just google or find here on Reddit.

Some ideas I have are,

- Win a game (Keep in mind you have the entire Season to do this)
- Do 1,000 player damage in a game
- Pass through 5 unique points of interest in one game
- Do 500 damage to players without taking more than 200 in a game yourself

Stuff like this that requires a bit more thought and skill, some that are challenging, rather than find ducks or something. I don't mind these, but I shouldn't have to go out of my way to do them.",FortNiteBR

Fast forward to the beginning of season 2, seeing how I was kind of bored of those skins anyway, I've decided to create a fresh account. This is the frustrating part.

It's now come to a point where I have an account with all of the previous battle pass items (season 2 + 3), as well as some other Item Shop items, and an account with just the Skull &amp; Scythe.

A couple weeks ago I felt like I miss playing with the skin (and the ongoing hype around it didn't make it any better), as well as the sound and looks of the pickaxe. I obviously can't tell whether the skin will make a return or not, so I felt like going back to that account. Now I'm having second thoughts again.

The issue is that there are many items (a couple dances, a background, a skin, a contrail and probably a few more) of previous battle pass items that I really want to have, so I'm not 100% about sticking to my first account (with the Skull Trooper). On the other hand, we may never get Skull &amp; Scythe again, which is a huge deal to me (especially due to the fact that my birthdayday is actually Oct 31st).

I just don't know what to do at this point. I wish Epic were able to transfer skins (after confirming I am the creator of both accounts, obviously - which is a very easy thing to do). That'd solve my stupid issue. I haven't even bothered making a support ticket about it because I'm kind of pessimistic about their response anyway... On the other hand, a trading system would also do the trick. The thing is that whenever someone suggests a trading system around here, they get downvoted to oblivion (because it's be a scamfest, even though that IMHO, 2-step verifications and what not, will easily solve this. Just the way Valve handles it, with Steam).

I know many of you will say that I should just stick to my newer account, because while we aren't sure whether Halloween skins will return or not, the Battle Pass items definitely won't. On the other hand, I also know that many people would rather have the Skull &amp; Scythe than anything else, due to the fact that it will probably not return, and I can't say that I disagree with either of these PoV.

That's too frustrating... Would love to hear what you guys think...

We won’t know what the blockbuster skin is until week 7, because knowing epic they won’t put it in the game’s files until week 7. That’s still 2 weeks away from this coming Tuesday. On Tuesday, the week 5 challenges will be released. The date will be May 29. 2 weeks later, when week 7 is released, the date will be June 12. I’m not sure if any of you keep up with Disney and modern entertainment like I do, but I’ve had suspicions of the blockbuster skin being related to a movie since the start of this season. Looking at the coming releases, the only superhero movie that comes out this June will be The Incredibles 2. Unexpected I know, but I think the skin will be that of the villain in the movie, screen slaver. You can see a photo of him in the movie and it seems to be similar to that of the silhouette we see in the blockbuster challenges. Maybe it’s hard to believe that epic games would partner with Disney, but it seems likely especially since epic partnered with Marvel already to bring us the Thanks LTM; considering Marvel is owned by Disney. Anyway, that’s just my opinion and my theory for what the blockbuster skin is, but feel free to share your own as well :) ",FortNiteBR

- Traps have been nerfed to do only 75 damage. Fuck you guys for deciding this was a good move the same week as implementing a trap challenge.

- Traps do not cover an entire square horizontally. So not only will they knock or kill someone with one hit, chances are they won't even fucking hit the person.

- Traps have an activation delay after being placed, even on a fully built structure. Even if you manage to knock someone and build around them, chances are you'll get rushed before your trap even fucking triggers (like I'm triggered right now).

*Well /u/Penance1, clearly you just suck ass and need to learn to get good.*

In a three game span I have: 

1. Knocked a guy and placed a trap next to him, and proceeded to get killed by his teammate.

2. Knocked a guy and placed a trap next to him, got rushed by his teammate, fought his teammate, and killed his teammate, ALL before the trap next to him activated.

3. Knocked a guy and placed a trap next to him, my teammate played decoy while the trap triggered and did not kill the person who was knocked right next to it, which then let him simply slide to the opposite side of the box I built. He sat there until his health wasted away. I figured since trap damage was the last thing dealt to him it still might count. NOPE

Nothing has made me hate this game more than this one single challenge. Fuck you EPIC for creating something that is some absolutely useless in game it would never cross my mind as an actual option to kill someone, and then making a challenge for it.",FortNiteBR

It was intense but super fun at the same time. There was no reason to take it down. 

The sky ramps were a key part of the mode. It added another level to the gameplay. You had to decide whether you wanted to push bases or build your own base. There were multiple times where me and my duo partner were fighting 3 other teams while in the air. It was the best part of the mode and probably the most fun I've had playing Fortnite. 

I've been playing the Battle Royale mode since day one. I've played consistently since the beginning. I've tried every mode and spent upwards of 1000 hours in the game. Epic need to stop giving in to demands. They've frequently back tracked and essentially need to grow pair. Sure, players spotting bugs and citing legitimate issues should be listened to. However, people coming up with ""problems"" that don't exist should be ignored. 

This community is pretty toxic. People complain about everything single thing yet they still continue to play the game. The game is good when Epic aren't constantly giving in to player complaints. Close Encounters has been taken down twice in one day. That is just straight up nonsense. There are loads of companies that make billions and aren't constantly giving in to demands. 

Epic are pretty transparent which is a good thing but they need to stop trying to accommodate every single person and instead stick to their vision. The game is fine the way it is. 

Close Encounters should be brought back the way it was.",FortNiteBR

Epic is literally punishing good players at this game.

Port-A-Fort, gravity stones, Vending Machines, Jetpack, and the most annoying one: the swap guns delay, making you impossible to do a fast edit and swap-shoot.

PLEASE Epic, this game is a BUILDING game. Stop bringing bad players an easy way to take the highground. It's so frustrating when you build a tower with 2 or more walls of height and then someone just pressing space or using a dumbass Port-A-Fort kills you from above.

Not even yet. Players who mastered the double/triple shotgun got ****ed just cause of the nerf. Nerf the absurd damage of the pump was the best solution. When you have 2 shotguns on your inventory you sacrifice a sniper, rpg/nadelauncher or an extra shield/bandages just for the better push and short range potential.

And what about kills. Why kills doesn't give you any reward? Even in Solo Showdown no matter how many kills you do in a game a noob bush camper with 2 kills winning the game gets more rewards than the one who died by him with 12 kills.

The new map with those gravity stones, the horrible ""dusty divot"" and those secret places are making me sick.

The only thing added in this game with some skillcap and great risk/reward are impulse granades.

Atleast remove the Jetpack, just, please. Don't bring this kind of items anymore in this game.

I really really love this game, but for me is just getting worse and worse.

So what if the damage against a wall was lowered to 90 or 95 to match the damage the pump has against players. So players can effectively outbuild double pump shotguns without the double pump just tearing through the walls and floors being built.

Fortnite's main attraction, building, is no longer important if your opponent has a JetPack. No matter how fast you build a 1x1 tower, your opponent will always fly up above your walls, and shotgun you in the head.

Shooting down someones structure in spite of giving them fall damage, is barely done anymore, considering they won't take any damage while wearing a JetPack.

I know EPIC already clearly states that JetPacks would be temporary, but that doesn't change the fact they could make them permanent based on positive community feedback. A couple days ago I saw an Epic staff make a thread here asking for exactly that: feedback on the JetPack.

Making them a permanent item would also permanently change the game's META for the worse, in my opinion.

I got used to it after awhile, but hitting my shots with 8, was significantly harder than hitting my shots with 7, and now I realized how much more important it will be for console players to get a separate building mode sensitivity. I can ramp up my sense to 8, maybe even 9 and build like a maniac, but still have my regular sense set to 7 and still hit my shots. 

For those of you who play on 4,5,6, feel free to try it, bump your sense up 1 or 2 and then go back down to see how accurate you can be. 

Let me know what you guys think.

But one thing that's making my mind getting super stressed about is aiming. So even after 1500 games, I can't aim for s***. My AR aim is quite decent yet my shotgun aim is super trash. I've tried like 200 games with sensitivities each from 5 to 9. Quick scope doesn't help me, I just can't flick shot, I always go either too much up or down or to the sides but just can't aim at a person. Idk how these people just and shoot in mid air so accurately while I hit one out of 10 shotgun shots even after 1500 fkn games man. I've tried all the sh**ty tips like crouching high ground and fkn headshots and everything they say on youtube. I just can't use my right trigger properly. One more thing. I still get super happy even if I get 1 kill when I thought I'll average 10 kills after 1500 games. I lower sensitivity for easier direct shots without using L2 to aim but still can't get any better. I'm sure I've landed in areas with decent population every fkn game. Example: Tilted,salty,pleasant,retail row etc. Help me how to use this right fkn trigger.

I have played almost every single day, completed every single possible daily and weekly challenge, collected all battle stars, etc. and I am only level 43 on my PS4 Account. I also play on X1, and because I can’t link my accounts, I bought the battle pass twice and on my X1, I am only level 40. I am aware that I would probably be a much higher level if I only played on one account but I still don’t think I would reach level 80 in time. Next week I go on vacation for 10 Days and I’m gonna try to get some time in on the mobile app at night to do some challenges but that really isn’t going to help too much. I just don’t think it’s too fair that we pay for a battle pass and there is a chance we may not even reach the final level.

*Suggestion:* I propose Epic lower the levels on the Omega armor challenges so that we can have a full Omega at Level 65.
*Alternative:* Epic could implement larger XP boosts, start giving XP for things such as ammo box or chest looting or material farming, epic could host double XP weeks, etc.
*Implementation Issues:* I am aware that lowering the level to 65 may make some of the community who grinded hard for level 80 a little upset. I hope that they can come to turns that not everybody can put the time in every single day to achieve such a feat; I actually do put the time in but because I’m a solo player, I get much less XP than if I played with friends making it extremely difficult. That is the only downside for my main suggestion but I hope those that feel that way would be willing to forgo their frustration. Now with the alternative, many issues could arise and it would be hard to actually implement a balanced XP boost system into the game. How much XP should looting a crate or finding an ammo box or farming 100 mats yield to be fair? What if they put a double XP week while I or you are on a vacation or unable to play?
*Conclusion:* I propose Epic should lower the final armor level in the Omega challenges to Level 65 so that everybody who spent money on the battle pass may be able to enjoy that awesome skin without having to sacrifice a lot of free time.

I am an average player, nothing special (100 wins in 1500 games). Up until yesterday, I was using the combat pro controller mode, which was good enough for me. I was able to make structures quick and protect myself and edit pretty fast for a console player. Apart from the fact that whenever someone would shoot me I would build an unnecessary roof/pyramid (pressing r1 and l1 back and forth when someone is shooting at you can be a little confusing) I was having no problem with it. The only ""problem"" I was experiencing was the fact that when the builder pro came out , other players got better at building (hence on the game) while I didn't. When it came out I gave it a shot but I switched to combat pro again, believing it suits me better. But, yesterday I switched again to builder pro, landed in moisty mires and start gathering materials. I practiced on building 1x1's as fast as I could and then I started pushing other players in  retail row. Got 4 kills, didn't win the game but I was feeling confident. After 3-4 games playing and pushing building battles i adapted to it. Now the game feels a lot better for me and I'm not afraid of pushing building battles. I feel a lot more confident :)",FortNiteBR

Must have something to do with how the field of view changes when switching aspect ratios as fortnite always felt a bit cramped, but at 4:3 I can actually see what is going on around me as the horizontal field of view stays the same while gaining some vertical field of view.

Land wherever in Jetpack mode.

Farm materials
Loot
Build a sky base
Once high enough nobody can shoot you down
Keep running towards cricle
Outlive everyone
Here is where you can either-
Drop down for final fight
Or 
Just stay high.
Both methods work
Obviously you need meds once storm gets small ebough

Only way to counter is to build up to it in which case have grenades handy.

10/10 games won so far using this strategy 

You heard it here first !

Enjoy",FortNiteBR

Unless you have a lot of materials to help get through the water, it's basically an ""avoid at all costs"" zone except for the perimeter. Being in the water makes you an easily killed sitting duck because you have so far to go before reaching land. It should be more akin to Moisty Mire, which has a lot of water, but with plenty of islands in between that prevent it from being so tedious to move around in. Loot Lake should have a lot more islands added inside the water and bridges connected to them so that you can cross it without having to burn through all your materials if you don't want to move at a snails pace.",FortNiteBR

I started playing and I continued to do so for a few hours. All 50vs50 games.

I know they don't count for stats, but at the moment what are stats good for? Nothing.

In 50vs50 you can chill. You can take your time to loot.

 Or you can decide to rush to the circle. Or even better drop behind enemy lines and go kamikaze. 

You revive your fallen friends. You knock enemies. You rock skybases and you build like a champion.

I just hope the new mode they intend to implement is something a lot like this one, because my friends I'm having fun.

Instead of changing the mode, I'd work on progression in it, and some sort of endscreen where you could see how you faired compared to your teammates. Also something to give more incentives towards the Victory and teamwork.

Anyway, sorry to take your time. That's just how I feel.

Something that MIGHT work is another currency, that can only be obtained from victories/top players. This new currency could be used to buy older EARNED skins (like black knight or Wick) so it wouldn't affect the current way we earn skins.

Check it out at /r/FortniteBRMeta.

### **Announcement**
****
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It seems that for a while now, there has been an increasing number of users concerned about the state of the subreddit. We would love to see all the problems and suggestions everyone may have, but this subreddit is not the place nor the most convenient place to give such feedback. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;From the beginning, this subreddit was designed for content related to the game only. As a result of this, /r/FortniteBRMeta was created. We're taking a page from /r/leagueoflegends (as they have /r/LeagueOfMeta) in order to better build the subreddit everyone wants together.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**Keep in mind though, we can only try our best. We will never be able to completely satisfy 100% of the subreddit.**

&amp;nbsp;

### **What else is it for?**
****
The subreddit is primarily designated for the following things:

* Rule Discussion
* Removal Disputes
* General Subreddit Discussion
* Feedback and Suggestions
* Changelog

&amp;nbsp;

### **Can you give some examples?**
****

**Good Post**

&gt;**Title**: Low Quality Post or Meme Changes
&gt;
&gt;**Content**: There has been a lot of inconsistency lately with the removal of posts deemed as violating the ""Low Quality Post or Meme"" rule. I believe that some clarification is needed for future posts.
&gt;
&gt;For instance, [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBRMeta/comments/8lpfdp/introducing_rfortnitebrmeta/) was removed for violating the rule but [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBRMeta/comments/8lpfdp/introducing_rfortnitebrmeta/) was allowed to remain at the top of the subreddit for an extended period of time.

&amp;nbsp;

**Why is this post good?**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A post like this does a lot right. It clearly states the basis of the discussion and provides evidence to backup the need for such a discussion. I cannot exaggerate enough that **discussions are meant to bring about clarification or changes**. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The subreddit is NOT for you to complain about your post being removed, but for a trend of posts violating/passing rules when they should/shouldn't.

&amp;nbsp;

**Bad Post**

&gt;Title: The Promotion Rule is Stupid
&gt;
&gt;Content: My post was removed and it didn't violate the rule. Why should I have to make comments to post my Twitch stream to the subreddit?

&amp;nbsp;

**Why is this post bad?**

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is a terrible post and a misuse of the new subreddit. It only applies to an individual post and the author provides no references to any posts or comments for evidence/review. This kind of post is not constructive and would be removed.

&amp;nbsp;

### **Why should I care?**
****
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If you have ever been one of those people complaining about the rules, or complaining about what the moderators can do better, this is your chance now to be heard! The new subreddit will be dedicated solely as an outlet for everyone to tell us how to do our jobs! /s

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In all seriousness though, please visit the subreddit for subreddit related discussion. Hopefully we'll tweak the rules to a point that most people are happy.

### **Anything else?**

Misuse of the subreddit will result in a temporary ban. **Obvious misuse** (spamming, intentionally off topic) will result in a permanent ban from the subreddit, and potentially the main subreddits as well.

The subreddit is also designed to be viewed on the new Reddit redesign, as it will serve as our grounds for future redesign exploration.",FortNiteBR

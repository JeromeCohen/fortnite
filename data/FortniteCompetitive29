I didn’t think much of it before, but after countless games these past weeks, it just feels more necessary than ever. I’m not amazing at the game, but I can put up a good fight and do alright. But it doesn’t matter. Because any game I do really great, I’ll always end up facing a true-blood sweat who already killed 15 other people and I’m just another ‘bot’ to clean up.


It’s not fun for me, a casual, to bother queueing up anymore and compete for that victory. No matter how much practice I put in, no matter what new techniques I learn, I will never beat the final boss: some dude who plays all day, every day, and queues up into games he’s clearly overqualified for to ‘pub-stomp’ with his triple-90, meta-abuse, after warming up in creative mode for two hours. I want to get better and ‘compete’ on a relative scale, but how am I going to get better when these players run around all the time?

Planes are too valuable to just willing blow it up. The biggest issue with planes is their turret. You can easily hover near someone using the brake and just turret spam with laser beam accuracy, get a couple tags and dive onto their heads. 

The ram through structures was overpowered as well, and never should have even been implemented, but it’s the turret and brakes that make planes disgusting with third parties. 

Removing the turret and booster on planes would put them in a good spot. You’d no longer be able to ram through builds, and would have to switch seats if you wanted to shoot while flying, leaving you exposed for easy shots.  ",FortniteCompetitive

I decided to hotdrop on Retail Row by the houses (I really dominate this place) I spotted and took a purple silenced pistol and started to laser some noobs across Retail, got two kills and went to loot them, one had a purple Pump and the other one a golden Scar ( r/wholesome ) so I was packing the win with this loot, and all of sudden some normie retard sweat starts lasering me from above with his balloon, I react quickly and make a 1*1 so I can start healing myself even thought I'm claustrophobic and I have anxiety problems; I really wanted this win. I got to heal myself all the way to 75 and was ready to one pump this noob that was over flying my building and all of sudden some fuckin moron and his plane just rams into my building and kills me.

When the pop ups came out with the 1500 mats the same zone still applies. I think the 1500 mats is great and much better than 3k but the zones need to be readjusted to not move as far in the moving circles. The current way makes it so if you are edge zone and dont have mobility you are pretty much dead. Changing this would make end zones less mobility RNG reliant. Epic also HAS to add mats go directly into inventory. With limited mats end game I always find my self have to get picks on rotations. But the thing is I NEVER can loot the mats because the zone is moving. Mats going directly into inventory incentives end game kills on rotations which take a lot of skill.",FortniteCompetitive

* Deagle should do different amounts of damage to different structures 
   * Possible 140 (wood) 120 (brick) and 100 (metal)
      * This would add a small skill gap and also make people have to think more about what material they are building with and think about the enemy players loadout
      * This can also lead to more teamplay, say in either duos or squads there is an enemy in a brick 1b1. One player would have to shoot the WOOD wall once with an ar, then other teamate deagles then first teamate snipes player inside healing. (instead of just deagle snipe)
* With the deagle not being able to break walls as easily, i think they should reduce bloom when not aiming in and increase bloom while jumping. 
   * This way, it promotes being able to use the deagle as a secondary while making it so jumping is a risk and making it harder to jump and hit somone for 150 from far away

We wanted to organise one for the secret skirmish and award a prize that is relevant to this whole thing, and something that will likely be used to its fullest potential.

Official graphic: https://i.imgur.com/33Km0sc.png

Rules: https://i.imgur.com/rBJnIdk.png

Choose your squad of 4 players. These players will score you points based on the official fortnite scoring system. We will then add up each competitors points for both solo and duo tournaments, so make sure you are choosing players that are good at both! Once the event is over, the winner and runner-up will be announced, and we will DM you, asking which streamer you would like to be subscribed too. The winner will receive 2, and the runner up will receive 1.



Whether you win or not, I hope this tournament will make the Secret Skirmish more fun to watch! If this goes well, we will definitely increase the prize pool for the upcoming event.We will announce the winners on our twitter @DraftBuff the following day.

Patch 7.40 addressed many issues but failed to address even more important ones.

For example, RPG and deagles were pretty meta and were an example of bullshit items. I'm glad they're nerfed. That's cool.

Let's look into some other problems that make Fortnite frustrating to play (doodoo AF). 

- Shotguns hitting random numbers depending on the server, inconsistent since the dawn of time. I should never hit all my pellets inside of someones body and hit 90-100 damage, just to get lasered by an SMG headshotting me for 40+ per tick and landing more damage than my shotgun in a span of a second (or dual pistols / ar hitting for 88 / 60 close range headshots). Anyway, shotguns are trash. This is the ONLY shooter/br I've ever played with inconsistent RNG shotgun damage. 

- Mats amount. Current amount in Pubs is 2990 rounded down allowing you to build 299 structures at full. Current amount in competitive is 1500 which is 150 structures. We should just make pubs and comp. game modes the same and make it 1k wood, 500 brick, 500 metal. Or just buff the competitive amount to 1k wood only. Wood is used for rotations and only 500 wood is not enough most of the time. 2k mats sounds good to me. What is up with the 999 number anyway, make it say MAX or 1000 so we can use an extra structure. 

- Planes. They were nerfed but they will still be able to third party laser someone because they have perfect accuracy. Nerfing the accuracy of the bullets to have bloom or lower accuracy would make planes even less game breaking. Keep them for transportation, not for jihading into someone lasering half or more of his health away and landing straight down on top of said person. 

- Turrets. Vault.

- Fireworks. Vault. Don't need these as a weapon all they do is make footsteps even harder to hear. 

- Glider Redeploy. Vault. Solution A: Bring back bouncers for build fights. Problem A: Bouncers have the ability to gain instant height advantage by applying under you (on a floor and building up). Glider takes up inventory space. Solution B: Put them in the special slot with launch pads and traps with only 5 use instead of 10 and make them self-activate when redeploy option is clicked. This is also another suggestion instead of vaulting because I do feel they have a spot in fortnite but are also kind of annoying the way they are atm. Solution C: Vault them and nerf fall damage. I like Sol. B the most.

- Oh yeah, footsteps. Dogshit btw.

- Tac shotguns and grey weapons. Just get rid of common rarity, honestly. Vault them all. Tac shotguns need legendary and epic rarity. Some people want them out completely but I disagree. Pumps are so inconstent I honestly would prefer using Legendary tac into an AR instead of the same boring pump smg strat over and over. 

- ALL splodes supply drop only. Not just RPG. Nade Launcher too. This helps RNG early game where you're only chest is a nade launcher and you basically die for it. 

- Ranked mode, because nobody cares about pop up cups and nobody taking them serious right now.

Dynamites are no longer an issue really with the drop rate being lowered, and boom box is gone too so we're getting somewhere. ",FortniteCompetitive

I think I was one of the few people who actually liked the edit change, turtling was completely gone. Sure there were a lot of things wrong because the game isn't designed around being able to edit everything. But it had so much potential. I think it was one of the few changes that actually increased the skill gap. 


There is so little you can do to a person turtling, plus you are at such a disadvantage when you try to kill him.

Almost all PC players who play competitively that have died to a console player most often blame it on aim assist. They claim it’s “overpowered” and “broken.” But even though it’s an advantage to console players, they really need it. 
  
    PC players have so many more advantages then console players; they can edit super fast, they are able to build &amp; aim better than most console players, they have the ability to play stretched, etc. So when you think about it, aim assist is one of the only things that gives console a fighting chance. Just because you die to someone on console while your on PC doesn’t mean you should easily be able to beat them, only because they play Xbox or ps4. It seems like pc players are in a way kinda greedy trying to take away console’s main / only advantage.

 It's obvious that the game will be getting stale, we're at the point of the season where usually the game would be coming into a new season bringing a tonne of changes. Ranked (if it's coming) won't be added in a mid season update, surely people understand that, it'll be launched with the opening of a new season.

74,jamesjette,1549933425,apngr8,15,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/apngr8/unpopular_opinion_zone_damage/,1,Unpopular Opinion: Zone Damage,"I’m gonna be brutally honest for a second: competitive fortnite is at arguably the roughest spot it’s been at yet this far (aside from the whole sword fiasco) and the game in general could use a bit of reworking. This new patch seems extremely promising, but something I would like to address regarding comp is storm damage. 

If you have played in or watched any high level customs or scrims as of late, endgames are ruled by mobility and rng storm positioning. Often times, there is literally nothing you can do if you are stuck on edge zone without launch pads or rift-to-gos. You are generally forced to rotate with the entire lobby, letting those ahead hold you as the storm is at your back. This is especially annoying when the zone goes straight up a mountain. In my opinion, if storm damage was drastically decreased, it would allow for far more creative rotations, and help eliminate a huge amount of rng when having to rotate straight up mountains.  If you could move more freely outside the zone it would allow the option of a super late rotate, where you could choose to sacrifice health in order to not be targeted from those ahead of you. This would also be beneficial from a spectating standpoint, as last minute scrambles outside the zone in order to make a winning play would become much more common.  

Not sure what the optimal damage change would be, but around a four or five tick for the last zones seems like a reasonable amount.  With the limited mats I do not feel like this would increase heal offs or other non-spectator friendly finishes, but instead decrease the impact good zone rng has on endgames. 

TLDR: endgame zones should do considerably less damage",FortniteCompetitive

Is it healthy?,"-I’m a controller player and controller doesn’t equal console so pls don’t say “pc has graphic options and custom res!!!!”- 

I just wanted to spark a discussion about the viability of a controller at top tier play. This is in no way hating on console/controller.

As we know, most esport titles at the highest level of play, a controller isn’t viable which is why we see division based on input i.e Smite.

But in Fortnite we can see that at top tier play a controller can compete and be a viable choice. But why? 

This can be attributed to a couple of factors that we don’t see in other Titles:
-Stronger Aim Assist
-Amazing controller optimization 
-easy inventory selection.
-Low TTK
-Skill gap being reduced.
-shotguns doing a ton of damage and tracking being easier on Controller.
-LT spam (I know MKB has advantages doesn’t mean this isn’t an advantage) 

Obviously most of these things aren’t bad and is great that Fortnite seems to want Controller players to be able to compete.

The only problem I can see is that if epic makes the skill gap bigger controller players would be at a bigger disadvantage due to the skill ceiling being significantly lower on controller making MKB 

TLDR:  should controllers be viable at top tier play and is it healthy for future balancing of the game.

The only thing I see wrong with it would be pub stomping. If that’s so, should it only be allowed in pop up cups n stuff?

It would also be cool if you had to reload the gun and switch faster then, so it’s harder to preform and it takes high mechanical skill to use.

70 is way too much people, that's like having 50 people in a boxing ring all going at it. It's somewhat interesting too watch but I'd rather see two good players dueling it out rather than 40 people running for their lives, 20 people gliding down, and the rest third partying. It's literally a absolute cluster fuck and takes no skill to get kills.

I thought this subreddit hated RNG? If you make it to endgame and there's 70 people left you better your cross your buttons and pray to god you have circle and it's not in another universe or up polar peak. 

Third partying doesnt take skill. Waiting for other people to fight so you can fight isn't skillful, it IS smart but it doesnt take skill. It's like I'm in the boxing ring and just hiding and then popping out to sucker punch someone then running away. 

10 - 20 people would be the perfect amount leftover, it actually allows for outplay potential without the risk of getting lasered from god knows where. Imagine we have 2 - 3 people fighting for ultimate high, 10 people fighting in mid ground and the rest low ground. The risk of third partying still exists but not enough to force you to turtle up.

Yet everyone gets mad when you criticize it's obscene power.

Yes, the RPG is annoying. Yes the Deagle breaks builds to easy, No the Heavy Sniper shouldn't do 157 on body shot. But let's be honest, which weapon actually kills you the most? I feel like if you don't say the pump, you're just being dishonest or going through mental gymnastics do defend it.

This is a weapon that at blue rarity can one tap people with 200 hp with relative eaze. It's a 100% mandatory staple in your inventory that can literally not be substituted for anything if you are actually serious about winning or getting kills. You don't need a deagle, you don't need and RPG, but you absolutely can not play the game without a pump. It literally defines this games meta right now. I really feel like half of what makes the deagle so OP is because the pump is so OP. 

It's pretty much objectively the best first weapon you can get on a hot drop, because it's easyto use and it shits damage. Why track a target with an AR or SMG when you can just jump around and pump someone who's standing in the general direction of you crosshair?And can we stop acting like shotguns are a high skill weapon, they aren't They have a very forgiving hitbox and do tons of damage. The pump is so good in fact that it's basically less risky to engage in a 50/50 pump fight than to try to track a target with an pump&gt;SMG combo.

The Legendary and Epic pump were honestly completely unnecessary additions to the game, that really didn't help it's already absurd power creep. Epic needs to stop making shit do more and more damage. This is why the Heavy Shotgun lost purpose, this is why the bolt sniper lost purpose, this is why the compact smg will lose purpose.

Everyone has different opinion on why the game is so awful to play right now. From planes, to turbo build delay, to loot pool dilution, and much more... all of those reasons are correct. 

I have a theory that I think everyone can agree with, so here’s my story: (it’s a bit long sorry!)

I have been playing fortnite since season 1, I have maxed out every battle pass and have around 16000 games played. There is a reason I have played so much, I am very competitive and was hoping to play competitively. Fortnite was my first pc shooter though, so even in the early seasons I was way behind everyone. 

I was definitely an average player up until season 3-4 where I finally locked in my aim, keybinds, and gamesense. The game was so much fun, I passed the majority of players in skill and when I did get outplayed, I would be amazed. It was awesome to get destroyed, I would take notes on exactly how this player got me and learn his tricks. 

There obviously were plenty of times when I got killed by below average players still, maybe getting sniped out of a 1x1 or hit by a rogue rocket, but my reaction was still “damn he got me” and I would try to learn how to prevent that happening in the future. 

It all went downhill from there though, as I continued to improve ahead of most players, The game got more and more aggravating. It wasn’t “damn he got Me” anymore, now when I died it was “damn he just killed me because he had an rpg” or “damn he just killed me because he phased through my floors” I wasn’t having any fun being killed, and I wasn’t learning anything from playing anymore. 

This got gradually worse up until the end of season 6 when winter Royale qualifiers went on. I was ecstatic to have qualified, I even called my parents to let them know, I was so excited. And then the actual tournament comes around and all my excitement was snuffed immediately. There were planes, there was a freaking sword... this was supposed to be my big break and all I got was a big “F U” from epic. I didn’t think I was going to win, but I was at least excited to test myself against some amazing players, but I didn’t get a chance. I didn’t get killed by any amazing players, I got killed by planes, a sword, the storm, bugs... Not once did I get into an even battle or a fun fight. Even the couple of players I killed, it wasn’t fun, they didn’t stand a chance, the result of the fight was predetermined and had nothing to do with skill. 

Fast forward to these placement cups... I hated them. They were awful, 4 games in and I didn’t want to play anymore, which was a first for me. I reluctantly finished my solos with 27 points... which is a pretty damn good score I think, but I didn’t feel like I was doing well, I felt like I was bored out of my mind. Most of the kills I got were early game when people didn’t have guns, or late game when they were trying to rotate. 90% of my game though, was spent sitting in a box, doing nothing. Even when it got to endgame it wasn’t a test of skill, it was a challenge of who could third party the most to get the most launch pads... 

My point is, the game is not rewarding anymore, to win or lose. it hardly feels like you have to be skilled to win, or that the guy who killed you really outplayed you... you don’t fight against the skill of other players you fight against their loadout, Mat count, third parties etc. 

the game is way too complex and varied, and to top it all off the servers can’t even handle it! I believe the game would be 10x as fun by just vaulting 50% of everything in it. ",FortniteCompetitive

Just watching Nick Eh 30’s live stream of the Share The Love event, and he just went on a very un-Nick style rant that I thought best illustrates the communities frustrations. 

Unfortunately no clip function on YT streams, but a few bullet points:

“This is the worst kind of tournament”

“Planes drain your health and destroy your builds, and the guy can hot drop straight into your 1x1. It takes away from gun play and building, which is what people fell in love with. What is Epic thinking and why won’t they explain?”

“This is not competitive”

“We can’t even take part in Friday Fortnite tournaments anymore because Epic capped tournaments and now you have to get permission to do an event. Let people do what they want!”

“When they do an update they pretend to listen, but it’s all PR and saying things at the right time, it’s really just what they (the devs) want”

“This competition is so boring”

I know none of this is really new, but if a guy like Nick is getting that frustrated and vocal about it, it MUST be terrible. That’s on top of the ground swell on Twitter from all the liquid guys, myth, CoL guys, pretty much every big EU name...

Also I’m aware Nick isn’t really considered a “competitive pro”, but fans of his stream will know he aspires to bridge the gap between creator and pro, and I genuinely feel bad for the guy that his (and everyone’s) attempts are taken away from him by unfair items and a borderline unacceptable meta.

This is the first time I’ve genuinely felt like the game is dying. It’s like they created a real diamond and then overshaped it and oversold it to the point of farce. It’s a shame.

I go by the handle joel X, I’ve been playing Fortnite since early December of last 2017. I have about 700+ wins and 20,000 plus total kills, both from pc and xbox. When I first started this game, it was like nothing I had ever seen before.. It had building like minecraft, graphics that reeled you in, and an environment that was fun and not toxic.. I started playing the game before the game ultimately blew up and a lot of things have changed since then.. But let’s break this down...

So the reason that I believe that this game has basically gone from being a game based more about IQ, decision making, and skill, to a game based upon RNG, luck, and spamming, is because of one simple addition to the game which was turbo building. 
In patch 3.0.0 or the beginning of season 3, was the addition of turbo building, which went from having to place what was built where, to a mechanism that allows you to spam your build anywhere it can go, at any given time, at the literal speed of light, and to be honest, when it was first added, I didn’t think of this as being bad... Being on a controller, building was a slower thing, it was a little bit harder to build, things on console were pretty bad through those seasons as well with a lot of crashing, lot of downtime, a lot of waiting etc.. But the game was smooth, it felt good to play when actually playing, it made you want to play the game.. Seeing huge names such as Myth being crazy good builders, and Ninja being a great player, made you want to play the game religiously. Fortnite in that time had this certain feeling and we can all agree on this.. 
Within a few weeks time-span turbo building had started to what I believe had it’s negative effects on the game.. The average player started to become very good at building, high ground before hand would be something skilled players/builders would be able to take, and it’s because they dedicated their hours and time to learn the games mechanics and develop their IQ of the game. Now, you can go into playground mode for 5 hours, and become just as good as the best builders in the game. Fortnite has introduced countless and countless different counters to building since patch 3.0.0 trying to fix what they brought upon themselves in turn ruining this game further and further, and soon it’ll be at the point of no return.. The problem is that there is no actual skill gap in this game and that is a HUGE problem, people who have grinded and put in the work in this game, are not rewarded anymore. 

Counters to building as of 02/07/2019:
RPG | 
GRENADE LAUNCHER | 
GRENADES |
STINK BOMBS |
FIREWORKS |
PLANES | 
DYNAMITE |
DEAGLES |
SCAR SPAMMING (accept it) |
HEAVY SNIPERS |
MINIGUNS | 
MOUNTED TURRETS |
BALLOONS  |
QUAD CRASHER |

The one thing that made their game different, was the building aspect.. The fact that you could build for cover was unlike any other game we had ever seen before. I just listed off 14 guns/items in the game that counter building as a whole. Rocket spamming in early Fortnite used to be a huge issue and in early Mw2 days we liked to call that NoobTubing. Me personally, I don’t think that any weapons of explosive descent belong in Fortnite, as they take no skill or effort to use. It’s very easy to shoot someone’s wall immediately after you shoot RPG for an easy high damage hit or kill, especially with the ONE-SHOT deagle.. I constantly see hate being brought upon the deagle, but I never see anyone bringing up what really ruined Fortnite.. Turbo building basically made it so that everyone can get a chance, so that the casual player can stand a chance against good people, rather then Fortnite adding a ranked version of the game.. I think the way that this was all brought upon was awful.. I think Epic games used to listen to their core main audience and now they listen to nothing but corporate head offices.. The problem is that Fortnite created a large sum of money shortly and the owners took advantage of this.. Trying to appeal to people who aren’t hardcore fans of the game is the wrong way to go, making the game easier is not the way to go. What made Fortnite different was because it was different, now you barely even wanna get on anymore because you don’t know what kind of screwed up shits gonna happen to you today.. 

My suggestion?
Is to make this game more based upon skill level, rather then appealing to the everyday noob. I suggest getting rid of every single item I listed, and removing turbo building.. 
We want to see people be competitive, we do not want to see people spam rpgs and deagles at other players in huge Fortnite tournaments, we do not want to see people throwing stink grenades and spamming miniguns.

Imagine a Fortnite where the only explodes are grenades and smoke grenades are another counter. Where weapon skill and IQ truly came into play, where you’d have to think about building and what you would have to build before, rather then spamming your mouse or joysticks relentlessly. This would make the competitive scene much bigger, much more competitive and I truly believe would bring back the life to this game, would bring back the good feeling and smoothness that Fortnite once had. Right now this game is based on nothing but RNG, and who has the better load out, or if you have a plane. 

Fortnite also needs to add shield per every kill, and possibly some building material for kills, also increase the amount given from objects, not a single person is playing this game as a farming simulation to gather materials for half of the game. 
Many of you may agree with me, and many might disagree.. But if you’ve played since season 1 or season 2, you’ve seen the negative impact that these additions have added to the game. I think as a community we need Epic Games to fix this game that we all love, because it’s really, really getting out of hand. Thanks :)

If you suggest that they place players from different matchmaking divisions together to combat not having enough to fill lobbies, again you are wrong. The purpose of ranked mode is so that you can play people in your own skill level. A hypothetical gold player being shit on by a hypothetical platinum player is going to lead to a horrible feeling and incessant complaining about how poor the matchmaking is.

For the other divisions, I assumed a similar amount of players are playing this weekend in the share the love placement matches as the Winter Royale qualifiers. 9.2 million from both EU and NA played in the qualifiers. Assuming that NA and EU have a 50/50 split in players during the Winter Royale, that means approximately 4.6 million players from NA are playing in the cup this weekend. I have to note the lower point thresholds are inaccurate iirc the original post of the model. I think the post said everything below 10 points were extremely fuzzy. 

Champions - Top 0.02% - Top 1000 - 24 points

Contenders - Top 3% - Top 138000 - 12 points

We were running max points for a fair bit and were doing really well, until clear PC players just started obliterating us.

Late fights were dipping to what had to be sub 30 FPS, and was basically unplayable. At what point is all this changed.

I played a lot, I didn't win any games but I had 12 points in this particular match.

The game starts and I decide to land Shifty ( that's my place ) the bus wasn't that close to it, so it couldn't be considered a hot drop. As I glide closer to Shifty, I get a glimpse of what could be a blue pump ( fuck yeah ) so I land on it and grab it,   but as soon as I grab it, to my surprise I hear another player landing by me, and for my luck, some minis were also close to me, so I put em on and went lookin' for the early pick. I spotted the tryhard sweat noob on the houses nearby Shifty, he was a fake no skin, and had a TAC. I was already feeling confident that I would get this kill cause I farmed up to 300 wood before going after him. So I'm approaching this kid that was getting some mushrooms and I double ramp rush him so I could get a good shot on him, and this fucking idiot just RPGS my whole building, I end up taking fall damage, I tried building some quick 90s to recover myself but the building delay just fucked me over and Harry Potter'd myself so instead I decide to make a 1x1 and hold it down, applying all the strats I learnt in this subreddit, but this sweat noob retard just W keys me to oblivion until he gets inside my 1x1 and hits me with a shitty TAC shot that ends up killing me. Like, what the fuck Epic? How is it fair that he has an RPG at the start of the game and I don't, I literally spent all my mats so this w key kiddo just RPGs me and then humillates me with a TAC!? Like I had a blue pump and this kid just kills me with a Tac?!

Just after this happened, I was so stressed I smashed my keyboard right on my desk and all my Cherry switches went flying (I still cannot find the W key) I was so overwhelmed and stressed by how badly balanced is this Battle Royale, that I rushed into the bathroom just to puke bile. My dad heard all of this so he confiscated my computer and now I cannot play the fucking cup, making my chances of going pro almost non existent, and all because Epic shitty game.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me start out by saying this. I do agree that there are aspects of the game that make it difficult to play at times (i.e Deagle, RPG, Dynamite, Heavy Sniper, and unintentional Zip Line interaction.) I also agree that some of these items should have a slight nerf to them. However, it seems like everyone in this sub complains because the game is not 100% fair all the time. I wanted to say that this is what you signed up for. 

&amp;#x200B;

A BR is not meant to be fair all  the time but it is meant to be balanced. Right now I agree that the game needs some balancing work but in my opinion it does not need that much. Removal of planes is an obvious one but a nerf to the Deagle or Heavy Sniper isn't needed in my opinion. Here is an example: So someone with low mats can counter someone with a lot of mats with a Deagle. That seems to be the purpose and vise versa someone should not win the game just because they have a lot of mats. Luck of the loot does, and should, make A difference during a game not THE difference. If you didn't get a Deagle or RPG and the person/team you're fighting does well as Tim says, ""That's the way of the road."" 

&amp;#x200B;

RPG is good early and mid game but not much use during the end game with all of the quick building going on around you. It is too risky to use with the threat of blowing yourself up. Same with the Heavy Sniper. Late game no one has the time to reload it. The Deagle however has 7 shots before you have to reload and is very useful end game. As a ""fix"" they could lower the amount of ammo in a mag. My main point here is the abilities of these items should not be changed but the use of these items is where the ""fix"" needs to be.

&amp;#x200B;

If you take a step back from the consistent raging that is on here you might be able to see why certain items that are controversial, are also necessary. Fortnite has come a long  way and they still have work to do with bugs and balancing the game out but this community has also gotten a lot from Epic and never seems to be satisfied with what they give. Keep in mind that this is a free to  play game that has constant updates and generally listens to its community. Every now and then they do something that seems to make no sense but they take care of it. They gave us Pop Up Cups, Builder Pro/Custom binds for controller players to keep up with the competition, Tournaments with large prize money. Also keep in mind Fortnite has 78.3 million monthly players and there are 96.2k players in this sub. They have done a lot to cater specifically to 0.12% of its player base (assuming all comp players are members of this sub.) 

&amp;#x200B;

So moral of what I'm saying here is, please stop being so negative and if you don't like something stop taking shots at Epic and have faith that they will take care of the truly ""broken"" parts of the game even if it isn't an immediate fix the fix's always come.",FortniteCompetitive

Basically, Eric was asking the community for ways to accept explosive damage through walls. The statement we should be concerned about to nerf the Deagle is this.

&gt; Should all materials have the same damage reduction? That is, should metal have a higher mitigation than wood?

In other words, metal would have less damage dealt to it than say, wood. This is how we should nerf the Deagle. By making the Deagle deal less damage to higher tier materials, while keeping the same damage against wooden walls.

So, it should go like this. 

Wood- same damage (150)
Brick- Less damage (95)
Metal- less damage (100, 105)

It would still one shot wood, allowing turtles to be less effective. It will not one shot fresh brick or stone, and it instead would take another shot, allowing the person to recuperate.

And for safety, the Deagle should get a mag reduction to 5 or 6, just so it’s more linear with the pump shotgun.",FortniteCompetitive

1. I land paradise usually and 90% of the time I got killed off spawn, it was by someone who got 200 health and a blue pump in their first house and just rushed me. What am I supposed to do in that situation? 

2. After the first circle closed the most players I saw alive were 28. And the worst part was EVERY SINGLE ONE had a deagle. It’s so common and so broken to fight against. I don’t understand why I can box up on a mountain so I have good positioning for late game, and then one kid decides to use 50 heavy ammo on me and 10 rockets. Now I just get fucked for the rest of the game because one kid never stoped trying to deagle rpg me from 150 meters away. How is this a viable competitive strategy?? 

3. Why are planes still in the game? The people who sit in planes are actually the biggest cunts in the world. You try to shoot one down and it turns into world war 2 and every plane in the sky starts shooting at you. If you don’t shoot at them, you get third partied by them while outside of the zone. I just don’t understand how epic thinks that planes are good for competitive fortnite?

4. RPG. Do I really have to say more?

5. How do you counter campers? Let me explain. I just make it into zone after getting held in zone and I run into a building in lucky. I have zero mats because I had to fight in zone and couldn’t loot the guy in storm so I start farming the walls. Then a guy comes out from underneath the stairs and one pumps me for 220 damage. He had 200 health and was under the stairs for 4 minutes before he came out to shoot me. This was in a 20 point game so it wasn’t some random bot that hides in bushes all game. I just can’t think of a way I could counter that play style because he didn’t move an inch so there is no way to even hear him.

6. Rift to go. It’s broken op. Every game I won, I had 2 rifts in my inventory. It’s just a get out of jail free card only found by good RNG and I think it’s time it gets looked at by Epic. 

7. Pumps do too much body damage. Why reward someone for shooting me in the foot compared to shooting me in the head? It just doesn’t make much sense to me for them to have buffed the body damage by so much. It’s just another aspect of the game that takes less skill.

8. Ping is everything in this game and I don’t know how epic can fix it. I usually have around 40 ping and I can’t tell you how many times I have been fucked over by it. Enemies can replace my wall every single time, shoot through my turbo build, and phase through my turbo build and I can’t do anything to counter it. The honest truth is I have no idea how epic can fix this. 

9. Phasing is dumb and needs to be relooked at. Why should holding W on my ramp allow it to act as if it’s not there? In a game about building for cover, why is it that my enemies can just walk through what I just built? Floors are the worst offenders of this and it’s just so frustrating to die to. 

10. I love this game. I have poured hours into this game. I was level 100 EVERY season. I have literally been playing since day one and I remember waiting for the release because it was gonna be the first Battle Royale on console. I switched over to PC and learned mouse and keyboard so that I could be better at this game. I love this game so much and don’t want to see it fail.

With the 500 material mat cap, it can be difficult to get through a long end game at high point levels. However, a setting that helped make this more feasible was that your bonus mats on kill (around 150 I believe) were deposited directly to your inventory. So for example if you beam a guy from high ground with an AR in a scrim, you are still rewarded for the kill with a decent amount of mats even if you can’t loot the body. Now however, the only reward for kills is 50 shield and potentially points. Which is great until you run out of mats. It simply should just e reverted in my opinion. ",FortniteCompetitive

This would work perfectly if we were to spawn with 200hp.

A few things i need answered : 
 When you get the first 15 points in 1 sesh are you immediately fighting to get the next pin IN THAT SESH or do you have to wait for it to complete?

And if so (wait for sesh to end) how will that work out mathematically being that there is only 3 sessions total? Does that mean i can only earn 3 pins between these 2 days?

So it leads my other question when is the other sessions? It seems pretty clear cut that its only those 2 days.

If getting the first 15 points were to immediately open up a new event for you will you be able to immediately participate or is there a time for that new Division even, or is the next pin available within the first event just at later points 'Say, 20, 25, 30, 40

I think its pretty bad in terms of length, if it was 6 hours for 2 different tournaments it would be fine, but to stay concentrated for 9 hours without a real break, its pretty exhausting.

I think Epic doesn't think about the mental state that shit puts you in if it doesnt go into your favour, when I think back at the Winter Skirmish qualifier and the amount of time I spent to be at 27 pts for 4 different events, I was beyond mad.

I think Epic should really evaluate how long those events are going for because franky to me, and I bet some other players(if not a lot of them) 9 hours a day is just insane, that doesnt even factor in the warm ups you do before..

100% gonna be a repost but for those who haven't seen this I think it's hilarious. I wish the pro community was more competitive about early game drops, and instead of complaining they'd fight for their right to an area. For instance Nickmercs/Sypher and Zexrow being completely lighthearted about landing viking in scrims, and killing each other for the rights to an area. I mean I get it in certain scenarios such as Tfue scrims where you have to ban an area so that you don't get stream sniped repeatedly, and yes RNG makes early games a mess. I guess what i'm trying to say is i'd enjoy watching the pro community more if they played with balls. Like Nickmercs for instances. In his first encounter with Aydan at the Lan he was eager to try and get one over on Aydan after their encounters, and was entirely gracious about the experience. That's how an adult operates. A lot of these pros are just whiny. ",FortniteCompetitive

Epic doesn’t need to please us. The competitive players are not as big as the casuals, as in almost every game. So even if good ideas pop up in this sub (which they do), Epic will almost always look away. 

So I guess what I’m trying to say is that we (the competitive players) need to really change our mindset. Going forward, let’s stop being the most toxic Fortnite community.

401,IvoAlbino,1549629925,aog6g0,46,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/aog6g0/alternative_point_system/,1,Alternative Point System,"Some things we should question ourselves about current competitive point system: 

1. Does the current competitive system rewards different strategies? **No**
2. Does this system makes the game monotonous and predictable? **Yes**
3. Most important, does the current system gives the viewer the thrilling experience that other e-sports give? **No**

Imo, we need a proper algorithm for a competitive environment, that reward both kills and placements, allows different strategies and gives the game more action from start to end .

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

&amp;#x200B;

# Given that, we could consider the following algorithm for the points system:

&amp;#x200B;

**(KILLS \*** ***PLACEMENT FACTOR*****) + PLACEMENT POINTS**

&amp;#x200B;

**Kills:** 10 points per kill

**Placements:**

* **50th - 26th:** 10 points
* **25th - 21st:** 20 points
* **20th - 16th:** 30 points
* **15th - 11th:** 40 points
* **10th - 6th:** 50 points
* **5th - 2nd:** 60 points
* **1st:** 80 points

***Placement Factor:***

* **100th - 76th:** \* 1.5
* **75th - 51st:** \* 1.5
* **50th - 26th:** \* 1.6
* **25th - 21st:** \* 1.6
* **20th - 16th:** \* 1.7
* **15th - 11th:** \* 1.7
* **10th - 6th:** \* 1.8
* **5th - 2nd:** \* 2.0
* **1st:** \* 2.5

&amp;#x200B;

**Examples:**

* 1st place with 2 kills:
   * (20 \* 2.5) + 80 = 130 points
* 11th place with 5 kills:
   * (50 \* 1.7) + 40 =  125 points
* 29th place with 1 kills:
   * (10 \* 1.6) + 10 = 26 points
* 5th place with 0 kills:
   * (0 \* 2) + 60 = 60 points

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you think this is a viable system that would allow different strategies?** 

**Would it make the game more unpredictable?**

**Is this point system balanced?**",FortniteCompetitive

I really love the game, ive been playing for over a year now sinds season 1, and even though sometimes i didnt agree to the changes i atleast had the core game to enjoy.
As of right now im not sure if im trying to win or trying to not lose my mind when i play this game.  

My issues with the game:

WEAPONS: they get stronger and more OP to the point were it just feels cheesy to kill people and no longer feel like ive accomplished something.
PLANES: they are there for rotations and that is fine, the ramming and turrets are just an fun toy for someone who doesnt care about fortnite but just loves to spray everything down on there 1 hour of game time a week.
EXPLOSIVES: the blast radius and ability to destroy every wall within a 2x2x2 is just to much, aiming the gun is just unnecessary and is very lame. The nerf from unlimited ammo to 12 is just saying i know its unfair but dont worry he only has 12 if u dont count the ones in the gun and there teammates inventory!
BALLOONS: they are completely silent and promote camping A LOT, 
DEAGLE: the reason it got buffed was to make the item usefull but making it insta break everything is just to much, its a cheesy way to kill someone and doesnt take a lot of skill.
MATERIAL HP: back when a wall had a normal amount of health and u could actually use 1 wall to keep someone from shooting u i could actually use it to plan a counter attack, now that every wall is blown away by allmost every weapon its like i have to spam builds and i have to overbuild and turtle to not get hit. I cant counter because people keep spraying everything down.

Conclusion IMO:
Overpowered guns create a game were the danger of getting killed lies just around the corner in combination with Bad wall HP creates a camping/turtle meta that makes the game unenjoyable and unsatisfying to play. Please go back to your roots in season 8 because I fear that I and a lot of other people wont be having the patience to go through another bullshit meta that pushes us further from the fortnite we fell jn love with.

This gamemode is all about skill:

\- each player starts with the same loadout

\- Players can choose their loadout from the option menu of the gamemode, so the could match against players with the same loadout they chose.

The zone starts small, and begins to move after 2 minutes.

The winner will get 100 XP if he wins.

Last night I was playing duos with a friend of mine and we were discussing how this game must be for my brother who is new to Fortnite this season. My friend started in Season 4 and I started in Season 1. When I started, you were considered pretty decent if you reacted to someone shooting you by putting a wall up instantly and then stairs (extra good players would put walls up around all the sides too lol).

Now, if you can’t snake in the last circles and edit through your builds instantly while also being mindful not to overbuild while taking out opponents to replenish your materials, you’re considered below average and will have a hell of a time getting a win. This was the case last night where we had nearly 20-30 people in every game by the 5th circle. 

Epic has responded to the fact that their game is becoming quite unapproachable to new players by adding items and making changes that nobody wants. Even the bad players will eventually become good enough to realize how disruptive the “build counter,” items are.

I don’t know how we can make them realize that the solution to the skill cap problem isn’t making items that lessen the skill cap but rather making a mode where you can place players among players of similar skill levels. These two issues are always talked about in separate threads but Epic needs to realize that they’re both just different results of the same problem. ",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

But maybe it can, and I'll convince you it should.

&amp;#x200B;

During the edit cup formally know as The Architect Pop-Up Cup. Players were on opposite end of the spectrum. Some loved it. Others hated it. Each how had their own reasons. I'm here to bridge the gap. This is where The Purge comes in.

&amp;#x200B;

If you haven't seen The Purge, it's a film set in a world, where once a year every year all laws including murder are allowed.

&amp;#x200B;

If Fortnite adopted this same thinking, the edit cup may have been a smash hit.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how it would work. Instead of having the edit rules lifted for an entire match what if they were only lifted at certain times. Imagine this. It's end game. Everyone's boxed up. There isn't a wooden wall in sight. You're scrimming. Then the horn sounds. And for 30 second all builds are neutral. Anyone can edit anything for a period of time.

&amp;#x200B;

Is this a step in the right direction. Is this how we balance the edit cup?

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know.

Their initial reaction to Apex is to bribe the big content creators with more in the form of creator codes.  Instead of fixing the countless number of bugs, introducing a long awaited and asked for ranked mode and just the general polishing of their game this is the route they have decided to take and its also the route they have decided to take in the past.  The custom codes they will be sending out will no doubt be going to the biggest content creators in hopes to draw them back to Fortnite and bring the casual viewers with them.  They know that if the most popular fortnite players are playing a new game, talking about how the new game is fun, polished and has plans for a ranked mode that the casual players will start follow their favorite streamers.  Instead of polishing their own game, fixing the many bugs in their own game, creating a ranked mode in their own game, Epic has decided its easier to just bribe content creators to come back and stream Fortnite.

Epic has been doing this all along.  They have never really created a proper comp scene and all of their NA tournaments in the past have been a complete fuc\*\*ng joke by releasing updates right before them so they can promote new items in the game.  They have been offering huge prize pools for these tournaments which is basically bribing players/streamers to continue playing their game.  The players have known for a while Epic will almost certainly make some stupid ass update right before the tournament changing the entire meta without warning but the prize money is such a huge sum that they deal with the ass pounding anyway. 

This is how Epic has decided to treat the community and more particularly the most dedicated player base.  Buy off the large content creators and screw the rest.  I guess they have figured that its cheaper to do this than to actually polish/fix/balance Fortnite.

All of this being said i am still playing Fortnite for now.  I have downloaded Apex Legends and will start playing it tomorrow through this weekend.  I love Fortnite and it sucks that Epic is so arrogant and stubborn.  I really hope they decide to do the right thing and spend resources to fix bugs, polish their game and form a balance team.  If they think the casual players are going to stick around after the big content creators leave they are in for a world of hurt.

It’s been many moons where fortnite has had complete control over the battle royale community. And with the dawn of a new huge game that all the streamers and content creators are playing.

I feel like epic id kind of like the pubg devs at the height of their game. Hopefully apex legends makes epic realize that if they don’t pick it up they will lose LOTS of players.

[In the absence of an actual ranked playlist in Fortnite, i have decided to create an ideal world where this is a ranked playlist and this is the loading screen \(above\).](https://i.redd.it/ptszjnwqw4f21.png)

I have briefly outlined a scoring system and league brackets. Obviously whilst on ranked you would only match-make with people in your current league, there would probably need to be leagues higher than the brackets i have outlined but i think a concept similar to this would be perfect. It would be similar to that of Clash of clans.

Do not forget they put a sword in the middle of the map a day before the biggest NA tourney. A week before that added op planes and zip lines with no interact and changed the entire map.

Do not forget they are forcing boner cups instead of a proper ranked for almost 4 months and told us boners still be a better ranked even though it only operates at select hours.

Do not forget that every 2 weeks they added one click items to completely nullify the 100s of hours you spent learning building.    

Lastly, and I could go on and on do not forget that Epic devs never communicate intent and when they do communicate it's to try to frame themselves as something they are not: a dev that cares about players.  

They only care about top streamers and I say this as someone who made 20k in the last 4 months on fortnite tournaments half the time because I was an influencer.   

Let's keep this in mind going ward and stop jerking off the devs especially when you see how they've been withholding stuff weve wanted for so long.",FortniteCompetitive

I’ve been playing on pc for the past 3 seasons on my controller. I know, sucks to be me but 144 hz feels way better than my PS4. I tried in Season 6 to switch but honestly knowing the games mechanics for over a year and not knowing how to use them frustrated me. I’m determined to switch now that Creative mode exists and it’s the start of a new season with new players. Can I get any advice, tips, help, carries or maybe even some one on one to better myself?

Most fortnite players play on PS4 because of the graphics... At least everyone I talk to does... But I don't get why people care about graphics, if you cared more about your game play then you would use Xbox, if you care more about graphics, you use PS4. Why graphics? Because graphics make the game look better. I'm in no way trying to hurt or offend some people.... But why do you care about graphics? If you do play on PS4 and disagree with me, I don't really care. I play for gameplay... Not looks... ",FortniteCompetitive

The semi-finals today was pretty frustrating though. The event on West started right when the East was on their 1 hour downtime before Finals, so all of the East players were over on West. Mostly W-keying and greifing because they didn't care and wanted to stay warm for the top 3000 finals.

Then for the final hour of the event on West, the guys that didn't qualify for Finals on East (because all they do is W-key and never play for late game) just kept ruining everyone's game on West.

&amp;#x200B;

I just feel like if you're playing the tournament on East, you shouldn't be allowed to spend your 1-2hrs of downtime greifing on other servers and ruining everyone else's 10 games. endrant",FortniteCompetitive

**Make Sure You Watch The Videos As well As Reading The Tips.**

&amp;#x200B;

By The Way I'm Only Taking Out Tips That I Can Maybe Find Useful Or Other Average Players Not Nit Picking Every Detail.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[**How To Improve Your Movement Fortnite**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peiNgo8e80Y)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Don't **Jump** In Close Range Fights. Unless You Have Mats Or Can Get A Clear Head shot By Jumping On Top Of Him   
  And Getting An Good Angle.

. **Counter Strafe** Rapidly Instead Of Jumping Around. (Basically Crouch Spam And Also Strafe A Or D Erratically)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Practice Counter Strafing **Everywhere** And Always So You Will Be Harder To Hit For People Sneaking Up On You Or   
  Trying To Snipe You.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Never Expose Your Body **More** Then You Need To.

&amp;#x200B;

\- DON'T **Watch** Your Bullets To See If They Hit Or Not. Shoot Take Cover Repeat.

. When Sniping, Snipe Crouch Do A Quick 180 And W Key Back, To Quickly Regain Cover.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Abuse** Right Shoulder Peek Whenever You Can.

. Make Sure To **Counter Strafe** When Abusing Right Shoulder Peek.

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Abuse** Ghost Peeks And Crouch Peeks As Much As Possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[**How To Make Good Decisions (Fortnite BR)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUFcef3OJfA)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\- Use All **Tricks You Know** For Example Shoot Through Door Glitch, Side Jumps, And Other Situational Stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Always Keep **Moving And Building** To Keep Control Of The Fight And To Catch Them Off Guard.

. Try To **Abuse Shoot And Build As Well As Edit And Shoot** Early Game. A Good Example Of This Is Someone   
  Like MrSavageM.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Even Though The Previous Tip Is Very Important You Should Also Learn When To **Sneak**. Sneaking While 3rd Partying

  To Elimate When Someone Is Weak Can Help A Lot, Especially In Squad Fights You Can Coordinate With Your   
  Squad When To Shoot, How,  And When.  Maybe If You Are Weak You Can Also Try To Hide. Hope You Get The Point.   
  Sneaking To Surprise Kill Enemy Can Also Save Your Life.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Be **Patient** For Example If Someone Is Spraying Your Structure Wait Until He Breaks It Then Shoot Back, Or If   
  Someone Has The Blueprint Out And You Think He Is Going For An Edit Wait Then Shoot Him, And Maybe You Need   
  To Lineup A Head shot Take Some Damage And When You Have A Good Shot Blast Him.

&amp;#x200B;

\-  **Always Take Hard shots** If Your Comfortable With Your Health And Mats. If You See Someone Just Shoot Them   
   Unless You  Are Following A Specific Strategy To Win Or Some Challenge. Helps With Aim So Much Overtime As well.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Play Your Advantage As well If You Hit Someone For A Lot Of Damage Play Really Aggressive Don't Let Him Heal,   
  If Enemy Has Splodes Best Bet Is To Push And Engage A Close Range Battle Making It Risky For Him To Use His   
  Splodes, If Storm Circle Is Far Away **Avoid** Fights And Try To Get To Safe Zone, But If You See Someone Being Pushed   
  By Storm, Pressure Him Most Likely He Will Panic And End Up Leaving Him Self Exposed. **ALWAYS TRY TO FIND WHAT**   
  **YOUR ADVANTAGE IS.**

&amp;#x200B;

\- Actively **Think** About These Tips If Your Going For Kills Or Wins.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[**How To Improve Your Aim (Fortnite Br)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tygkw-CrkPc)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Learn Good Crosshair Placement Aim Head shot Level, Predict Where Enemy's Can Be, And Track Enemy's   
  Through Structures.  I Talked More About This In My Aiming Txt File. (Will Reveal Later)

&amp;#x200B;

\- **Take Time** When Shooting At Someone Far Away Don't Spray And Pray, Calm Down And Line Them Shots Up   
  Especially If They Don't See You. The Crouch Peek Shot Is Very Good For This As well As The Ghost Peek.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Practice Hard Build/Edit Shots As Much As Possible To Be Unpredictable And Get In Some Free Shots, They Require   
  More Mechanical Skill So Be Prepared.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Warm up With Aim Trainers Or 50v50

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[**How To Fight Multiple Opponents (Fortnite BR)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJepVnJvwQA)

&amp;#x200B;

\- If You Hear A 3rd Party Coming In Try To Distance Yourself From Your Current Fight And Take High ground.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Take Advantage Of Every Little Thing You Can For Example Try to Target The Low health Players, Always I   
  Repeat ALWAYS Take Shots At People With Anything Whenever You Can. For Example If You Got High ground And Your   
  Not Being Pressured And You See An Enemy Sprinting Out In The Open Do As Much Damage As Possible. In   
  Squads People Get Caught Off Guard Easily Because Of Everyone Fighting So Take Advantage Of It.

&amp;#x200B;

\- This Is Where The Tips About Sneaking Earlier Come In Handy, Try To Sneak Up On Some Of The Squad Members If   
  Your In A 1v4 Early Game, Try To Pick Them Off 1 By 1. By Sneaking Across Corners, And Getting Free Shots. Try To   
  Loot Them Afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Never Play Support Roles In Squads Don't Camp Back Shoot And Let Your Teammates Do All The Work, Good When   
  3rd Partying But Will Train Bad Habits For Regular Games. So Don't Be That Guy At The Back Doing No Work And   
  Stealing Kills.

&amp;#x200B;

\- 1v4 Late Game Try Your Best To Pick Them Off 1 By 1 And Always Keep Moving You Never Want To Be Caught With All

I play console(PS4) and am currently having issues upping my gameplay. I have hit or miss days (like everyone), and usually averaging about 5 kills per game (this is dying about halfway in, playing aggressively all the time).

I currently play on 6,6 sensitivity with 1.55 building sensitivity. No crazy stuff added to my controller.

I use Sandwich course to get used to the sensitivity, and another accuracy course, but I find difficulty translating what I do there to the in-game.

For those console players out there, I’ve seen crazy stuff. I want to get to that level. I want to drop my first 20 bomb (my record is 16). What methods/tips and tricks do you guys have to getting to that “beyond” level. I’ll spend days in creative if I have to. I just want to get güd.

Even then, in very legitimate lobbies, they were getting stream sniped like crazy. With large point counts, comes long queues, which means easy stream sniping potential. 

This concerns me regarding the World Cup, which I’m sure the vast majority of the major streamers will be broadcasting live. 

I’m not saying all of these names will qualify, but I just really want Fortnite to thrive with as much competitive integrity as it can. I am concerned that pros like Chap, Tfue, Cloak, etc. will stream and that their point counts will suffer from it. At first I figured that they‘d already know this, but — for example — Tfue favoring his stream over participating in Katowice, and Chap wanting to do the same, sets a concerning precedent. 

I understand that streaming comprises the majority of these players’ livelihoods, but — again — I just am really hoping for a competitive event with a lot of integrity, so I hope that they just won’t stream (or if they do, with significant delay). 

Interested to hear people’s thoughts about this. 

(TL;DR — Stream snipers could ruin pros’ World Cup qualifying runs, especially in high-point lobbies when queues are long. I’m concerned streamers will favor their stream over qualifying and still stream) ",FortniteCompetitive

The fact you now get points for top 12 instead of top 5, means you don’t have those games higher up where you play a 20 min game only to come 6th. Making a win give 3 points and the other placements 2 gives hat slight extra bonus for winning. Then finally, the system actually worked.

&amp;#x200B;

My proposed solution to this issue is to create maps which cater to around 30 players, each player has unlimited materials and a select ammo count. Each player gets to pick their loadout. Each map has pre-determined zone movements which would allow players to learn them by heart for the different maps, resulting in different points of contension/strategies which would be different for each map.

 This would eliminate all RNG elements from the game and result in a very solid, skill based competitive game mode for Fortnite. It would also mean that Epic have the freedom to add items to the base BR mode which are more orientated towards the casual community eg. Quad launcher, boom box ect. Another positive of this is that there'd be less competitive players in the base BR mode, making it more enjoyable for less skilled players to enjoy the game without getting shat on every game by Mr TTV.

&amp;#x200B;

Side Note - The loadout picking could be tweaked so as someone cant pick four rocket launchers and a pump. a pick / ban system could be implemented, or even have 5 - 10 pre-determined loadouts to choose from.",FortniteCompetitive

Well, I don’t know if this particular thing has been talked about before, but I think it explains scenarios like “my pump doesn’t shoot”.  
 So, for quite some time, I’ve been having problems with shotgun inconsistency. One time it would shoot, and another it wouldn’t. I didn’t know what was causing it, even thou that I knew it wasn’t the cooldown, since between my shots there was a significant interval of time. So since I didn’t know what was the reason for this I just got over it and blamed it on game inconsistency and hoped it didn’t happen in game since it was “random”.   
 But yesterday while I was trying something in Creative using a pump, it didn’t shoot 5 times in a row, so I knew that it wasn’t just a random thing caused by a game inconsistency.   
 What I did was just edit and then shoot. I repeated the process slower, because I wanted to understand what exactly was causing this, and the rate of which the shotgun is pulled out caught my eye. It just seemed TOO slow. I wanted to compare its rate to the rate of the rest types of the guns and it turned out that the shotgun one was significantly slower. In the clip you can see how obvious the difference is. Then what I do is just edit with my smg/shotgun, try to shoot and you can see the difference between their effectiveness. When I was doing it with my shotgun, it didn’t shoot because the pump hasn’t been pulled out yet and the shots didn’t register.  
 What irritates me is the fact that shotguns are the only ones with a different rate of drawing and they probably did this to counter edit shots.   
 So even thou they actually buffed building and vaulted items such as boombox and explosives to counter it, the game still punishes you in certain ways after you build or edit.  
 And this is kinda obvious after what I’ve wrote, but I just thought I’d bring it up.  
 When you are for example in a box and you are about to edit on someone, while the other person is not doing anything and just tracking your character with their shotgun waiting for you to edit so they can shoot you back, they have a significant advantage since they have already pulled out their gun and they are most likely to shoot you first…

Pc players(controller or kbm) have frame rate advantages, and we cant deny this is not fair for console players.

People would argue and say that someone on x points is put into that lobby for being skilled enough to compete against the x point level they are in. When you add that factor in, suddenly they may aswell be 10 points behind what they actually are(exaggerating to make a point)

Personally seeing pc players vs pc players makes sense to me, and seeing console players vs console players also makes sense since personally i dont want to have to purchase a pc just to have the same advantages as other players. Also i would highly prefer finding the top console players and playing against them. 

Discuss if you want, moan if you want, but if you want cross platform play then it may aswell just be in the game for good, across everything. I dont find the fun in competition play when im forced to have to decide to play against someone with an advantage or play casuals and stay bored. ",FortniteCompetitive

We are 7 hours away from the end of our first ever 24/7 ranked mode. Minus the server performance not being the best during certain times of the day, i am overall happy with how this LTM played out. Good point system and a good overall experience. 

One thing i learned for sure with this experience is that i can see BR games having a hard time implementing a ranked system due to the fact that the higher rank you are the harder it will be to find matches with 100 people at your level during certain times of the day. With this, should epic be matching high ranked players with lower rank players after x amount of minutes just to fill lobbies? What can be done? Or how can we go about this by making sure higher rank players get to enjoy the reward of being high ranked. Likewise for lower ranked players.

Just a few of my thoughts. Would like to also hear from you guys! So feel welcomed to through in some ideas!

I also made a (reworked) mobility map, with all the mobility spawns (vents, cannons, quads, boards, ziplines and rifts): [https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ays9hh/mobility\_map\_s8\_quadcrashers\_driftboard\_ziplines/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ays9hh/mobility_map_s8_quadcrashers_driftboard_ziplines/)

But since season 8 and world cup announcement I feel like it's forgotten about. Sure pretty much anybody can qualify for the final of the gauntlet, but what's the point when you're not on PC and have such a disadvantage? 

I laugh when I see PC players saying they're only getting 120 fps, if you guys played what console + switch have to put up with youd honestly quit. I am saving for a PC to be able to enjoy the things that most take for granted but not everybody can afford that luxury.

Cross platform was an amazing addition to the game and I dont for a second regret it, it allows anybody to play with their friends, but the huge drawback is that it sucks the fun out of tournaments for the majority of players competing because we have such a huge handicap.

A possible solution to this problem is to base a ranked mode off of average points per game (multiplied with quality of lobby), This way, a tiered system can be put in place with an ELO based off of average points per game in that rank. Once a player reaches a certain average points per match in that rank after 15 games, they either stay in the same rank for another 15 games, or are demoted/promoted based on their average points over those games.

**Point Calculation**

One thing that is pretty good from the gauntlet is the scoring system. My ranked mode would take that scoring system, but add a multiplier that fluctuates based on the quality of the lobby (how many players in your game are from your exact rank). A lobby full of players from your rank will have times 1 multiplier.

A multiplier slightly over 1 is added if you are placed in a lobby full of players from a higher rank and a multiplier of slightly less than 1 would be in place if you are placed in a lobby of lower rank players

*As always, this would only really happen in non peak hours because there will usually be enough players from your rank queuing.*

**Ranks**

* Copper
* Bronze
* Gold
* Emerald
* Platinum
* Diamond
* Champion

This way, players who are consistently getting high point values per game will be sorted into higher ranks, and players who can never reach end game or never get kills are not rewarded but are still playing players at their same skill level.

**Promotions**

Once a player reaches a certain average points per match in their rank over the span of a minimum five games (possibly more games at higher ranks), they are promoted to the next rank. *I don't have exact values here because it depends on the point system Epic uses.*

**Demotions**

Unfortunately with a ranked mode, you have to be constantly fluctuating up and down ranks. If a players' average point value drops to a certain threshold, they are demoted.  

**Epic should decide the promotion and demotion thresholds based on the point system they choose to implement),**

**Placement Matches**

Players will play five placement matches at gold rank to establish their primary rank. 

**Rank Reset**

My system would allow players to optionally reset their rank at the end of the season, so they don't get stuck in ELO hell.

**Smurfing**

To enter this ranked mode, you have to have at least 15 games played, to prevent smurfing at low levels.

**There are definitely some flaws with this system, but I'd like to hear your guys' feedback. I think this can truly be a perfect ranked mode.**",FortniteCompetitive

I've written a guide about positioning, see [https://www.dropbox.com/s/aif0jy1prxe0rjm/Heuristic%20about%20geometric%20positioning.pdf?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/aif0jy1prxe0rjm/Heuristic%20about%20geometric%20positioning.pdf?dl=0)

The goal of this guide is to give an explicit heuristic allowing people to judge what is a good or a bad position while fighting (to maximize damage output and/or to minimize damage taken). This should help people understand why some common tips are mostly false (like the so called ""take high ground"", ""protecting yourself behind a corner is better than standing in the open"", and so on). Obviously, most players have some relatively good intuition about positioning, but this intuition is never expressed explicitely. By expressing these intuitions formally and concretely, this guide allows for a conscious judgment of one's own positioning skills. Hence, even if what you read is something you understand intuitively, you should not judge it as trivial: this guide explains why something works or not, which is much more general than what your particular intuition would ever achieve.

It therefore benefits players at all skill levels, even the very top ones (believe me on that, most of them are very bad when it comes to optimize what I call their mechanical positioning, and I'm not even speaking of dodging skills here). 

It's mostly for FPS and not TPS, but the heuristic presented still holds true in the TPS case, so I'm sure that with some thinking, it's applyable there too. Enjoy.",FortniteCompetitive

You might remember me from this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/asa8vy/data_analysis_of_the_secret_skirmish_full/). This time I'm analyzing the results for the ESL Solo event. It was even harder to get the killfeed data for this event as I mainly had to rely on POV streams of players such as Chap, Ryux and Kinstaar. In total, it took me about 12 hours to collect all the data. Again, someone had to do it.

Once again, as a disclaimer, my native language is not english and I'm not a data science guy, but I try to present the data as best as I possibly could. Hopefully, you find it insightful or entertaining.

# Solo Event Results and Comparing Them to Secret Skirmish Results

First, we'll show the full detailed standings of all the players, showing their kills and avg. placement.

[Full Standings](https://imgur.com/a/Tueszkl)

One thing I noticed while creating this list was that my scoring didn't match the points shown in the ESL Website. Indeed, there was a scoring error from their part and I brought enough attention to get it fixed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/ax10jq/there_was_a_scoring_error_in_katowice_solo_event/).

Notable underperformers include Saf (65th), Aspect (69th), Chap (74th) and Poach (87th). Highest placing controller player: Kamo (27th). Viallinen was the only player not able to get a single point. 

[Teams sorted by Avg. Placement](https://imgur.com/GaODOT3)

[Countries sorted by Avg. Placement](https://imgur.com/mTn2sZe)

Note: I only count teams and countries with more than 1 player.

LeStream is the top performing team with all of their 4 players in Top 20 and an average placement of 12. USA is the country with most players in Top 20 (5). However, the best performing country in terms of avg. placement is the United Kingdom (23) with their 6 players placing relatively high. 

[Top 10 Avg. Placement](https://imgur.com/o0UEnCa)

As we can see, the format heavily rewards good placement in each match. High average placement is a good indicator of how well you'll do in this format. We visualize this in the following graph, and compare it to the results of the Secret Skirmish.

[Graph](https://imgur.com/mj8ZmBy)

We can see a strong correlation between average placement and rank, while for the Secret Skirmish, it's less linear. The ESL format definitely does a good job in properly rewarding placement. 

[Top 10 Kills](https://imgur.com/a/eRJeNug)

As we can see, emphasis on kills is very reduced in this format. 6 out of the top 10 killers did not make it to Top 20. Not even close. 

RizArt and Viallinen are the only players without a single kill. Vinny1x and Magin are the only players who make it to both of these lists, so their standings are well deserved. Interestingly enough, Magin was #1 in kills and #4 in avg. placement, while Vinny was #1 in Avg. Placement and #4 in kills.

We can take it a step further and see how the top 20 changes under Secret Skirmish rules. See if anything changes.

[ESL Top 20 under Secret Skirmish Format](https://imgur.com/TrbuXJI)

A lot changes. Magin takes it over Vinny, and Julez, Aydan, and Jarkos enter the Top 10 because of their kills. Aydan's aggressive early-game playstyle is completely invalidated by the ESL Format.

So, while the ESL format rewards avg. placement and consistency, the Secret Skirmish format rewards high kills and popping off. In my opinion, I would like to see a format that meets somewhere in the middle. One that equally rewards early-game slayers and late-game survivors in order to promote more variety in playstyle. But, that's just me.


# Winning Playstyles

We can try to infer the playstyles of the top 20 Players by looking at how their kills are distributed across early, mid, and late-game. In the following graph, blue dots represent kills and red dots represent deaths. Each box represents the distribution of kills for each player.

[Graph](https://imgur.com/CXxFkLt)

For reference, I consider early game to end around the 13th minute mark (2nd zone ends) and end game to start around the 17:00 minute mark (5th zone starts). 

Most of the Top 10 players had a lack of early and mid-game kills, focusing only on the end game plaement. For example, all of Vinny1x's 16 kills were towards the end-game. What separates him from the rest of the other players who played the same way was his high number of kills and top 50 placements in all matches.

We can actually see a lack of early-game kills and deaths across the whole Top 20. This emphasizes the importance of landing uncontested or disengaging from early game fights. One early death can mean the difference to make it to Top 20. You really, really have to play for end-game to rack up those placement points.  As we can see, the kills inevitably come as you reach the final zones. Try to think of kills as a measure to get resources and health, not as points. (All of this with storm surge under consideration).

We can still see other types of play styles. Players such as Magin, Hoopek and histtory did go for a lot of mid game fights and they payed off as they were able to win almost all of them. Go for mid-game fights if you're comfortable and certain that you can win, just know that it's risky for your overall placement. 

I know often times players are put into situations where they have no choice but to fight early. It's unfortunate as this is mainly due to a lack of mobility, getting contested, far away zones or psychopaths, things that are not always under a player's control.

It's also important to note that not a single Top 20 player got there because they ""popped off"" just one game. All of them have 3 or more great late-game finishes.

# Weapon Distribution

I was not able to get the cause of deaths for 35 deaths. It simply wasn't possible. The deaths I did record should still provide an accurate representation of the weapon distribution. 

[Weapon Distribution](https://imgur.com/iGAgkY1)

### Fun Facts

- Ghost Dmo got the only cannon kill, and it was on Ghost Kamo.
- Liquid Chap with the only Pickaxe kill on MarkiLokuras. This was off spawn.
- 72hrs died 4 times to storm.
- A total of 9 players had game crashes that didn't allow them to play a game. Nate's game crash was the only one that occurred mid-game (Funkbomb accidentally kicked Nate's power switch).
- Biggest rivalry of the tournament was Myth vs Noward. Noward was able to kill Myth 3 times off-spawn, while Myth only once.
- Farthest kill was a 226m snipe from Ryux to Bloodx.
- Ghost Issa was the most aggressive early-game player with 6 kills before Zone 2.
-  Secret_Milan is probably the unluckiest player getting 51st, 51st, 53rd, and 60th in 4 matches, just outside placement points.

# Match Pacing

Next, I created a graph visualizing the amount of players alive as each match progressed.

[Graph](https://imgur.com/oLXVzj1)

Deadliest zone was Zone #1 with 130 deaths. No surprise there. Not far behind, the second deadliest zone was Zone #6 (lasts 90 seconds) with 122 deaths.

I was actually more interested in how the pacing of ESL matches compared to the pacing of the Secret Skirmish games. I graphed the first 3 games of both tournaments.

[Graph](https://imgur.com/ze85i8T) 

Not enough of a difference to reach any conclusion, despite ESL's emphasis on placement. Perhaps, the Storm Surge does work in applying an upper bound of players alive each zone, leading to a very predictable quantity of players each zone.

# The End

Anyway, that's all the ideas I had. Hopefully I can do analysis of Duos. Depends if I can get the killfeed data for all the matches, which will be even harder. I accept any type of help! But anyway, let me know if there's anything else you'd like to see or if there's anything I got wrong.",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

It is pretty easy to survive until 50th, which is why you're rewarded with little points. But as the game goes on the harder it is to survive which means the higher placement points you should earn. Especially for high elo lobbies where making it to top 10 is very difficult and requires you to play all stages of the game better than most. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Eliminations:**

1 Elimination - 5pts

2 Eliminations - 7pts

3 Eliminations - 9pts

4 Eliminations - 12pts

5 Eliminations - 15pts

6 Eliminations -  20pts

7 Eliminations - 25pts

8 Eliminations - 35pts

9 Eliminations - 45pts

10 Eliminations - 55pts

Every elimination after 10 increases by 10pts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Early game eliminations are almost always based off RNG, especially if dropping somewhere hot. The player that gets the green pump, green smg, and two minis has to play with a lot less effort or skill than his opponent with a grey pistol and a scoped AR with 0 shields. This is why 1, 2, and 3 Eliminations are worth such little points compared to the others.

&amp;#x200B;

**Other Aspects of the Point System:** 

* Earning 12+ eliminations in a match where you're up against opponents of equal or above skill level is extremely impressive. Which is why 12 Eliminations would be equal to 75pts which is greater than 1st Place.
* If a player was to earn 100pts+ in a single game the next game they'll play will apply a x2 increase on either placements or eliminations, the player gets to decide. However, if the player does not choose they automatically get the x2 towards placements. Earning 100pts+ either means you do not belong in the division you are (smurfing) or you just happened to play super well. This mechanic kills two birds with one stone, gives the boost to players  that just happened to perform really well while also ensuring that smurfs do not stay in low elo for that long. 
* Losing points can be based on either placing poorly or through the bus fare system that's already implemented. However, I do believe players in D1 or D2 should not lose points for placing poorly, while players in D3 or D4 (More competitive players) should have a punishment for playing poorly. 
* Bonus Points will be handed out to players that perform well in a higher division or higher point lobby. If the queue times for D3 is high, and players have been waiting X amount of minutes the system will look for high scoring players in D2 (1900+). However, these players from D2 will not lose any points (From placements or bus fare) because they're being placed at a disadvantage due to facing off against better players. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ideal Situation to be in:**

Leaving early game you'd like to have anywhere between 2-3 kills, you have an elimination foundation to build off of. It's very likely that you'll be leaving your drop spot with fairly good mats (50 of each mats from each kill) and a pretty solid loadout and you've already earned yourself 7-9pts.

Leaving mid game you'd like to have 4-5 kills, now you're at a stage where if you earn a lot of eliminations in the endgame (Looking at you Tfue) you'll earn a lot of points. Because endgame IMO is the stage of the game where you see the most skillful players play the best. You deserve the high points you receive from eliminations because you've already built the elimination foundation from early-mid game. While if other players that are more passive decide to not fight as much early and mid game they will not be earning as much points as someone that decided to focus on eliminations and placements. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Different Playstyles:** 

Fortnite has two main playstyles with several different sub categories, aggressive and passive. In many of the bigger tournaments aggressive players have to play exceptionally better than the passive players just to have a fighting chance. Especially with the recent tournament ESL Katowice where one elimination was worth one point while placements gave you majority of your points. The main goal of Fortnite is to earn yourself the Victory Royale, but eliminating opponents is a key mechanic to earning yourself 1st Place which is why I made the elimination point system this way. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Three Types of Players:**

With this system you'll run into three types of players.

1. Those who are strictly playing for eliminations, usually end up dropping very hot and want to earn eliminations as quick as possible. Usually end up dying mid-game. These players will be earning less points than those playing strictly for placements. 
2. Those who are strictly playing for placements, usually end up dropping somewhere comfortable with minimum 2-3 other people dropping. Avoids fighting early/midgame and focuses solely on positioning, usually end up surviving until late and placing fairly well. These players will be earning more points than those playing strictly for eliminations (Unless Elim Player gets above 12 Eliminations).
3. Those who are playing for eliminations and placements, dropping either hot and earning a couple kills before rotating out to survive early or dropping at somewhat hot locations. These players will be earning the most points.

**Division System:**

The name of each division will vary depending on the season battle pass skins, to make it easier we'll use Season 8 battle pass skins.

In order to reduce queue times each division will require a large point gap to rank up. Another solution that this system has to reducing queue times is that the higher divisions have a bigger point gap and less divisions which means more players in each division. 

D1 needs a minimum of 80 players for the game to start.

D2 needs a minimum of 80 players for the game to start.

D3 needs a minimum of 70 players for the game to start.

D4 needs a minimum of 65 players for the game to start. 

**Division 1: Blackheart's Boat: 0pts - 1000pts:** This division will have most of the players and the shortest queue times, I suspect most players in this region will be between 0 - 1.5kd. 

**Division 2: Sidewinder's Snakepit: 1000pts - 2000pts:** This division will also have pretty quick queue times, I suspect most players in this region will be between 1.5 - 2.5kd depending on their playstyle. 

**Division 3: Peely's Paradise: 2000pts - 3500pts:** This division I believe is where most of the players in this subreddit will live. Especially the players that currently pubstomp but lack the competitive mechanics to push forward. 

**Division 4: Luxe's Lookout: 3500pts+:** This is where all the pros will be, but because it is 3500pts+ you will have some players who aren't considered pros still in the division. The best way to improve is to face off against better players and learn what they do to capitalize on your mistakes. You shouldn't be winning the games in this division unless you've earned the win, I believe these games will stimulate scrim/tournament like lobbies. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Ideas for Rewards:** 

* Different style for each division skin.
* Cosmetic Item
* Icon or Banner
* Highest point player in D4 receives something special. Trophy or something similar to the Challenger Jacket from League of Legends. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Notes:**

Any of these numbers given here can be changed or balanced. I'm completely comfortable with taking feedback and discussing my view on certain aspects of this system.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully this system gets the ball rolling and can be used as a chain reaction for other creative players to think of other ideas.

Some examples could be losing points for poor placement (100-50 lose points, 49-100 gain) or perhaps something else along those lines.

But the amount of venom I'm seeing people spewing at Faith, and the below the belt shots I'm seeing people take at her, are totally out of proportion to what she did. Especially since it is probable, although not certain, that Cowboy did in fact do these things based on what we know now (specifically that he was terminated from TSM on the basis that he breached his contract, which they wouldn't do if they didn't know he breached it since they could get sued, and Leena further stated that she spoke with multiple girls who corroborated it). People have called for Faith to be jailed (in spite of the fact that even if she was lying she didn't commit a crime... defamation is a civil claim), people have said that girls wanna get raped for attention (wtf), people are super angry at Faith for ""ruining Cowboy's career"" and ""stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from him"", people have called her too many rude and gross things to list out here, etc etc. You've all seen it.

It's depressing that it's 2019 and people don't seem to understand that IF one sexually harasses someone or sexually assaults someone and it ruins his or her career, it is his or her own fault. I'm still leaving room for the possibility that Faith made this up but as I stated earlier  based on what we know it looks more likely that she didn't make it up. People are upset that others are jumping to conclusions about Cowboys guilt but don't realize it is hypocritical then to jump to the conclusion that Faith is lying.

This is all obviously part of a larger social issue which I think is particularly relevant to gaming culture since it seems to be a fertile ground for sexism at times. In the grand scheme of things whatever happened between Cowboy and these girls doesn't seem too bad compared to someone like Harvey Weinstein so I don't wanna blow things out of proportion. But this is a microcosm of those larger issues in society....people who are outraged at what happened here are the ones who say the metoo movement is made up of liars and women who wanna get raped for attention....which we know because they said it in the threads about this incident. Why do people get so mad that a man's career is ruined if he sexually harasses or sexually assaults someone? ",FortniteCompetitive

He explained more and after a while he made sense, but I personally hate explosives in this game but that's a different topic. My idea was to make a brand new trap that goes on pyramids, it would be the first, that acts like a stink grenade would.

&amp;#x200B;

To further explain a person would be turtled and we would do that we normally do, go for wall replaces. What if though you were able to get the cone on top of him and you placed your ""stink"" trap on it and it created a rain of the stink gas just in that 1x1 from above. Therefore it forces that person to exit there 1x1's and engage the fight again. I could see this working in normal PUB's because the average person isnt that good at snaking so he will edit out and have a fight again and for scrims if someone had multiple then they could place cones all around their 1x1 so even if they snake they could just gas them again.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I thought this would be better then normal stinks, and I'm in no means saying both the trap and the bombs should be in the game at the same time, is because people arent forced to carry stinks now and it requires some skill because you need to be able to replace their cone which for good players means waiting till they heal and do it fast or trick them some way some how. I also dont think its too OP since you arent dying instantly and can fight out of it.

Im not artistic so I couldnt draw a potential look but I think this could be a counter for turtling this game needs. I was thinking the traps could be rare rarity and drops in stacks of 2 or something. What do you guys think?",FortniteCompetitive

Grenades bounce, and can explode mid-air which means that it requires way more skill than clingers which literally cling on to every structure you throw it at within range. 

Alternately, if they are gonna keep clingers, how about they come in a stack size of 2 with max carry limit of 4 per slot.

after epic added materials on elimination and increased the harvesting rate I think it's safe to say that having materials as floor loot is useless, I would rather get a grey pistol early game than landing on a house with materials only as floor loot...**¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯**
 
same concept goes for ammo floor spawn, we can increase ammo boxes spawn rate to 100% and remove ammo loot spawn from the spawn pool.
this should help early game fights be slightly more balallnced rather than who finds the only weapon that spawned in this house first gets an uncontested kill because the enemy only found ammo and materials as for floor loot.

The fact that you need to be in people face - at the risk of getting one pumped - while hitting for low damage might be the reason behind it.

Now as the title says, my suggestion is to vault the tac and bring back the heavy in lower rarities (Maybe uncommon and rare) 

The idea is to kind of copy how ARs (the only somewhat balanced section in my opinion) work:
The Standard AR is used because of its versatility, good FSA and ROF are the main aspects
Heavy AR is the Pump of the AR's, high damage but you can't spray and requires precise aim and good control of FSA
Silenced AR, similar to the standard but you lose some damage for the suppressor. 
Infrantry Rifle, kind of similar to the Heavy AR this one can be called the Tac of the AR's. Vault it aswell. 

With that in mind, Shotguns could be:
Pump, heavy hitter in close range, low fire rate and ability to one shot
Heavy Shotgun, Lower damage and higher range, decent fire rate.

I've been thinking about ways to break out of it but almost all of them I'm getting crapped on so want to see if you guys have a pick out of these options or your own advice. Let me paint the picture.

&amp;#x200B;

Console Controller Player. Around a 2kd and win about 5% of the solos I play. I actually only started playing at Season 6 so don't have as much time on the game but still hold myself pretty good thanks to playing CODs and the like my whole life.   


I don't land tilted and rarely hot drop. I go to main POI's at end of the bus (mostly Paradise and Pleasant) and land at same houses every drop. Get my 1- 4 kills and move on. I'll mostly play position from mid to end game and if people rush at me, I'm down but I play for the win I guess. I don't turtle up and pyramid edit look out like that but If I can get on high ground and snipe and just wait for next circle I will. Most of my wins end up being 5 - 8 kills depending on end game. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am almost always comfortable build fighting and rushing anyone when the situation feels right. (In Console lobbies) 95% of the time when I take a fight I either win or I hit enough damage to just think GG and move on. The other 5% are usually Gods who end up with 15+ kills and look like they play like Aydan. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is when I play in these Pop-ups and plugging in my controller to PC for harder lobbies, I get completely destroyed. Never got a pin in a pop-up (hovered around 10 - 15 in almost everyone.)  Couldn't get to 10 in prospect for some reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have a duo partner or anything to ""help me out"". I play with three different people and their KDs are .7, .5 and .1 (yes .1 guy irritates me a lot). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried landing tilted and don't really like it because of the (I feel like) heavy RNG and playing 10 games and making it out of Tilted alive once kinda makes me feel like I'm wasting my time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried Solo-Duoing/Solo-Squadding and just sucking it up to make me better. Half of the time I play with my squadmates I'm usually the only one alive at the end anyway so this kinda feels like playing with them but I still usually end up with 5 kills but dying to that one competent squad around my land spot. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've also tried playing in PC lobbies to make myself better and that was probably the worst. I know PC has bots and I'm not generalizing lobbies vs one another but in my own personal gaming history, I can't keep up with PC (hence why Pop-ups aren't good for me.)

&amp;#x200B;

End goal: I don't want to be a pro or anything and I don't expect to play like Aydan or Innocents but I would like to win about 10-20% solos with double digit kills, Solo-squad eventually on console and move up to playing on PC but not sure what could be the next action besides just playing more and probably rushing everyone I see. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm perfectly fine with doing something terrible that I don't like doing like solo-squadding and failing or landing Trump 50 games in a row. I just wonder if there's better options. I don't really play games to have fun, I play them to get better and progress. Kinda just feel like I'm in this weird spot where YT videos and guides don't really hit.

Are they allowing us to play as much as we can for the next 3 days and get as many points as we can? It doesn't really make sense because it seems like the people who are able to play more will get higher scores because there is no cap for games or time

UNLESS...

It's easy to rank up until you hit a high level where your skill will cap itself when getting into lobbies with harder people. Is this how it is? Once you get to higher level lobbies it's hard to even get points because of the -2 bus fare and people wont want to play because they will lose points rather than gaining points? Seems hard to believe that -2 points will prevent people from playing or gaining points when points seem easy to come by with eliminations and top 12 placement.

These tips can help you PLACE HIGH in the Gauntlet Cup. Any feedback is welcome!,"Hey guys!

So I recently created a video [(here's the link if you're interested)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d-Db_-2l4s) for tips/strategies that can potentially help a player improve at winning games in Fortnite... in terms of macro/rotations/decisions/evaluating options during a game. In this particular episode, I focus on playing proactively and taking opportunities when you CAN. It's super important to take low-risk opportunities that come your way that can provide you with the reins of the game.

**Summary of points in this video:**

* Why proactive play is the way to be CONSISTENT in an RNG influenced competitive game
* Discuss landing spot and why I choose to contest a somewhat popular spot (Dusty Divot)
   * High density of loot
   * Mobility access (in Season 8, this is the water geyser to the north)
* Taking in information, even little bits of information can help you immensely
   * Visual cues
   * Audio cues
* Don't always listen to gut instinct, sometimes taking a few seconds to actually THINK about your play will pay dividends
   * Is this play more beneficial to me than it is for my opponent? If not, don't execute, look for alternative
* Push players in a smart manner!
   * SIGNIFICANT hp advantage
   * Mat advantage
   * You can read the body language of your opponents to get hints on these \^\^
* Importance of extra shield during rotations
* Discipline to back out of plays when given INFO to do so.
   * Avoiding conflict if it's 50/50
* Studying the terrain on your surroundings, and making decisions based on that (Dusty crater, for example)
* Why playing on the side of a mountain is ADVANTAGEOUS
* Making fake turtles can give you more space to play with in condensed circles
* CENTER ZONE IMPORTANCE!
* Importance of threatening rifters when you control ultimate height
   * This is one of the ways you lose when you have aheight, if a rifter takes your height
* Kills give you 50 shield, look for opportunities. Just because you don't get mats on kill doesn't mean kills aren't important!
* Pay attention to surroundings constantly! (comes with practice)
* Mountains in ZONE = Rift buff
* Steal mobility when you can, saves your own.
* People on edge of zone are super vulnerable and predictable, easy kill opportunities
* Paying attention to (ALL AT ONCE):
   * Players left
   * Mat count
   * Ammo count
   * Storm time
   * Utility tools
   * Mobility tools
   * Audio cues
* How to close out the 1v1v1 situation in the endgame! (when you have height)
   * Third party the 1v1 below you, enter the fight once you suspect one person is about to die
   * Kill the third person from height, then challenge last guy in a smart manner (not like I did in the game, my method was risky!)

In any given scenario in Fortnite, there's always many decisions that one can take, but usually ONE is the most ""correct""/optimal play. I'd like to think that I'm an above average Fortnite player so I want to give back to the community, encourage discussion, and explain the way that I play so people can understand the game better, and ultimately improve. **Feel free to disagree and challenge my ideas too! I'm not perfect, I can be wrong as well.**

That's the whole point of the ""Inside the Mind of Zykoma"" series, where I think out loud, so that players can hear my thoughts vocally, and understand the thought processes behind my decisions and the reasons for why I'm playing the way I am, with the hope that they benefit from it.

I just wanted your guys' feedback on how I can improve the series in future episodes so that I can help the viewers the most. This can be anything from criticizing the format of the video, the video length, my voice is too quiet... etc. Anything goes.

Any positive feedback is appreciated too, so that I can continue focusing on that part of the series and work hard to keep it in the series! Also, if the video ended up helping YOU guys improve your Fortnite, let me know!

Appreciate every bit of feedback I get here :) I'll be replying to every single one!

&amp;#x200B;

Is there something im missing or not paying attention to or is just this how the competition is, pretty frustrating because I would play until 1-2am if I could but the tournament says its not running from those times, which makes it harder for me to get high pts as some other people who are EU or OCE.

&amp;#x200B;

Essentiallly this point system is just a race of who can play for longer and harder not ever allowing anyone that doesnt have 20 hours to play even a chance to catch up no matter how good they do. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently the top players are well over 100 some into 200pts... If they keep going at this rate they'll get to 1000+ points before this thing is over...

&amp;#x200B;

I'd propose that there'd be point thresholds where the points earned start to drop off the higher you get. 

&amp;#x200B;

Example:

&amp;#x200B;

0-100PTS

 Bus Fare: -2 Points 

 Victory Royale: +3 Points 

 2nd - 5th: +2 Points

 6th - 10th: +2 Points 

 11th - 25th: +3 Points

 Each Elimination: +1 Point 

&amp;#x200B;

0-200PTS

 Bus Fare: -2 Points 

 Victory Royale: +2.5 Points 

 2nd - 5th: +1.5 Points

 6th - 10th: +1.5 Points 

 11th - 25th: +2.5 Points

 Each Elimination: +.75 Point 

&amp;#x200B;

0-300PTS

 Bus Fare: -2 Points 

 Victory Royale: +2 Points 

 2nd - 5th: +1 Points

 6th - 10th: +1 Points 

 11th - 25th: +2 Points

 Each Elimination: +.5 Point 

&amp;#x200B;

and it could go on... now I litearlly just did that in two seconds and I don't really know if that would be the appropriate point scale, and point fall off rate... but the idea is simple.. the higher you get the harder it gets to get more points, this would give people who dont have time to grind for hours on end at least the slightest chance to catch up and potentially force their way into the next round.

It is -200 pts per match from the bus fare.

I assume that the extra 7 points is deliberate by Epic and that they have stats that show an average 7 players die from fall and storm damage each match, meaning matches will average 0 points in total given out. 

Unlike what many people here are saying, this means **it won’t work to grind all day every day to get points**. Once you get up to a point level where you start matching with players of similar level, you will be averaging 0 pts per game.

That said, for the very top-level players this isn’t quite true—they will never get to a level where they are the average player in the lobbies and thus will just continue to accrue points the more they play.

When competitive  Fortnite has had its time in the spotlight, the outcome has been embarrassing for esports fans who are used to established games and tournaments. Will the servers ever be able to handle the level of of building with the large numbers of players left in the late game? Maybe, maybe not. Epic seem to be trying to get to a place where there isn’t as many people in the late game with the storm surge and now better kill incentive introduced to try and reduce the player count end game.

IMO this is a positive step towards a less RNG based end game where everyone tunnels. I’d rather see players battle against each other in a large zone and showcases more than their building ability.

So what this is implying is that the system believes if you get top 25 in a game, regardless of kill score or anything of that nature, you ""belong"" at your current skill level. If you can get top 25 placement and nothing else consistently, you will maintain your average rank or climb small amounts of points slowly. 

Personally - as a relative bot who is better than the average pub player but rapidly starting to feel out of my depth about around 30 points, this system creates a weird situation for someone like me. I naturally prefer playing for placement than taking fights - and depending on zone and with how much everyone else likes playing aggro, getting top 25 is remarkably simple. Seems like if you can rotate into first circle and play second passively, you are almost guarenteed top 25. I went form 10-30 points in 10 games with a grand total of 3 kills doing this, just placing consistently top 25 and top 10 where i can. So just from playing ""smart"", ive ended up with what i believe is a hugely inflated score that i can maintain very easily, and possibly even climb higher, despite being a noticeably worse player overall than most others in my bracket currently. 

However as we are seeing with Pro players massive score numbers early on, going really ham on kills is clearly effective. If you can average monster KDAs like Zexrow, then this is definitely the best way to climb.  However this is clearly high-risk, high reward. If you are not averaging 5 kills a game at your ranking, playing passively like ive described is a much more effective way of maintaining rank. 

Thoughts? Do we just need to give the system time to work itself out, and players to filter through their ""placement"" games? Does the system over-emphasise passive play? Or have people just not adapted to the meta of the ruleset yet. ",FortniteCompetitive

1. The people who are in the lead will slow down a lot because they will be matched with players of similar skill so their kill count won't be so insane and will have a harder time winning.  This means your games at the lower end of the points will be easier for higher kills and easier wins. So as they slow up you'll be zooming forward.

2. They're que times will more than likely be the full 6-8 minutes because of how high their points are where you should have no issue trying to find a full lobby quickly.

While most people understand why there is a bus fare, some of us don't and others are wondering why it's 'only' -2 points. So the engineer in myself thought I'd explain it very quickly. TLDR at the bottom.

Imagine a game with 100 players. Everyone 'pays' the bus fare of 2 points at the start of the game. Thus, a total of 200 points has been 'paid'.

1 player wins, and 99 players were eliminated. In the case that everyone was killed (nobody died to zone/suicide), 99 points from eliminations are rewarded. 

25 players reach top 25, thus 25 players gain 3 points. A total of 75 points are rewarded to players for making top 25.

10 players reach top 10, thus 10 players gain 2 points. A total of 20 points are rewarded to players for making top 10.

5 players reach top 5, thus 5 players gain 2 points. A total of 10 points are rewarded to players for making top 5.

1 player wins, thus 1 player gains 3 points. A total of 3 points is rewarded to a player for winning. 

Total amount of points rewarded: 99 + 75 + 20 + 10 + 3 = 207 points.

A total of 207 points are rewarded, and a total of 200 points are paid. 

Considering the fact that a couple of players die to suicide or zone in each game, and therefore bit less than 207 points are rewarded, this evens out. Thus, there are almost as many points rewarded than lost. This results in as much players 'losing ranks' as players 'winning ranks'. Therefore, after a certain amount of games played, players will reach a number of points where they are facing players that are from their skill level. Hence, they will plateau and not gain more points. 

This is a solid point system where players are eventually matched against players from their skill level. That doesn't necessarily means that the point system is good. A point system that rewards w keying and doesn't reward placement could also even out like this point system does. A very simple example for this would be a point system where each kill is rewarded by 1 point, and dying is punished by deducting 1 point, without points for placement. This would obviously be a horrible point system, but it would also even out and match players against players from their skill level. However, the new scoring system that we have now, also does very well in that department. Each kill is rewarded as it should be, but the emphasis is placed on placement.

TLDR; this is a very solid point system that eventually matches players against other players from their skill level, while properly rewarding kills and placement. Props to Epic. ",FortniteCompetitive

A lot of other games have exploits as well that just enhance gameplay, take SSBM and CS:GO for example as well. Exploits are in general not a bad thing, it just depends on how broken it was. Which leads to my next point:

*DP was OP.*

During season 2, heck yea it was. At the end of season 4, it actually kind of wasn’t. People used pump-smg more than DP near the end of the season, and people started building more so it was easily countered. Season 2 tho no one built and it looks super op just shooting people who weren’t moving with high damage shotguns. Now, people actually build, so bring back season 4 DP and nobody would really use it competitively.

*It takes away the weakness of the pump, which is its slow fire rate.*

Now, that is the case. Pumps shoot super slow, but do high damage. But again, at the end of season 4, that wasn’t the case. Pumps didn’t do nearly as much damage as they do now, and that balanced out the fire rate of DP.

*DP deletes variety.*

It actually does quite the opposite(if balanced correctly). People could choose between pump-smg, Pump-ar, pump-deagle, Pump-heavy, pump-tac, DP, heavy-heavy(which was OP), and heavy-tac. It brought the game the most variety that it had at the time, but most people only used 2 shotguns since at the time it was OP because people couldn’t counter it well with building. Also most people used 2 shotguns mostly because of how fun it was, even if it wasn’t the most viable combo.

*It takes away the pump animation.*

Then we should remove pump-any other gun, shouldn’t we? The pumping process occurs around 0.8 seconds after the pump is shot, and if you switch to any other gun before that time, it cancels that animation. So if this was a valid argument, then that would take almost every weapon combo away.

Again, I’m not asking for DP to come back, I’m just clearing up confusion about it.",FortniteCompetitive

418,the_scientificmethod,1551838159,axtdy7,11,/r/FortniteCompetitive/comments/axtdy7/is_this_really_the_best_format_for_competition/,0,Is this really the best format for competition?,"Hi all, genuine question from someone new to competitive Fortnite: is standard Solo/Duo Battle Royale really the best format for competition? I'm only a (very) casual player these days but have been involved in other competitive games in the past. After trying to watch ESL Katowice, it seems like the format has a number of glaring problems.

1.    There's just too much randomness. Every solo round had a completely different top 3, with a single exception: TheVic finishing third and first in rounds 5 and 6… and he didn’t even crack the top 10 overall. On the other hand, the eventual winner didn’t make a single top 3 finish. I understand that placements aren’t the only determinant of score and that elims need to be rewarded to encourage offensive play. But this is detrimental to the spectator experience because the format guarantees that we’re all paying maximum attention to the last moments, so the final placements matter. My reaction to most of the later winners was “WTF, who is this now?”

2.    It’s difficult to pay attention to anything *but* the last moments. There’s simply too much going on for the commentators/observers to cover everything in the early and mid-game. What’s the point of encouraging offensive play if it’s impossible to show the vast majority of it? I get invested in a player who just pulled off a great kill, but then the camera cuts away from them and I never hear about them again.

3.    Despite the incentives, offensive play is still not feasible enough. The final circles still have like half the lobby in them. This is just insane. There’s no way a viewer can pay attention to everything that’s going on, and it creates even more randomness in placements.

4.    99% of fights seem to be two players camping in adjacent 1-by-1s trying to get a lucky replace or edit. I know there’s a huge amount of skill involved, but between two skilled players the actual outcome seems to be determined mostly by chance. So in addition to contributing to a chaotic endgame, the current meta is often kind of boring.

I really enjoy playing the game. It rewards a completely different skill set to most other shooters and has the potential to be a really interesting esport. But there must be a better format for competition.

Why not some variant of Team Rumble? Respawns alone would go a long way towards encouraging more offensive play. This would also reduce randomness by allowing for more engagements, so that higher skilled players can emerge more clearly due to the law of averages, rather than being eliminated after a single mistake. If we have to stay with standard Battle Royale, why not make the storm close in much faster at the beginning and more slowly in the mid-game? That would at least allow more time for commentators to cover the interesting mid-game battles, and allow more players to be eliminated before the endgame so it’s not quite as chaotic.

Maybe I’m just missing some obvious stuff because I’m new to this. If that’s the case, I’d really appreciate it if you guys could help bring me up to speed.

Thanks!",FortniteCompetitive

So using Katowice scoring, 5pts is for a kill: When there are too many players alive, it bumps kills to 10pts. After a certain time if there are still too many players it goes to 15pts, ect. Once enough people are killed, it drops back to 5. I'm not sure what the right multipliers should be. 

I also think this should start as early as zone 1. This could incentivize more early / mid game fighting if the kills were worth it. Because imo fights like vinny and zex vs aimhero and fox are much more skill and strategy based than pumping someone in the moving circles, and they should be worth more. ",FortniteCompetitive

In squads sometimes people will just gang up on one person and kill them in less than 10 seconds. Even when you find a weapon, you still may not win the fight if you can't get away from them fast enough or you get something as bad as the infantry rifle and lose quickly. It's like if the 30 damage with splodes through walls was still in the game.

We know that people will have to qualify for the world cup, but will there be invites as well? Excuse me if this is a dumb question, I'm just unaware if Epic has announced this yet.

But IN MY OPINION, there should be a mix of players that had to qualify, along with players that get invited by Epic. 

I have two reasons for this. One reason benefitting the player, the other benefitting Epic

1. In my opinion i think it would be really unfortunate if a player like Tfue or Cloak or 72hrs missed out on world cup because they had a bad time during qualifiers. Guys like them have proved that they're the best. They've earned enough respect and recognition around the community that they've EARNED a spot to compete in the World Cup

2. Leaving players out like Tfue, Nickmercs, or 72hrs would probably effect Epic's viewership of the event. Think about how many people follow Tfue and Nickmercs. And think about how many people watch these tournaments just because they're a part of them. Of course true fans of the competitive scene will watch regardless, but there's ALOT of other people that only watch these events because of their favorite streamer. 

(Btw, i'm not saying Nickmercs should get an invite. He's done okay in tournaments, but he's obviously not at the top, which he admits openly. I just mentioned Nick because of his big name recognition)

But what do u think? Should the world cup be qualifiers only? Or should certain players be invited as well?",FortniteCompetitive

I’m not here to whine about that I really just want to get better. 

That being said if anyone here is a good console player or any player for that matter I’d love to know what your sensitivities are or what if any remapped buttons you use, i very recently underwent complete sense and layout change (jump to L3, increased sense to .6, and scopes and ads to .25 ish, also changed edit to a and confirm to LT) and am still getting used to it but I feel like at least the L3 jump is helping (I don’t have a scuff or pro controller). I’m really struggling with the sensitivity, I feel like to be a better player I need higher sense and I’ve really felt it help in shotgun fights because I’m hitting shots I could never hit before while falling and dragging, but for the life of me every time I try to lock someone far away with an AR I can’t keep my reticle close or even steady. It could definitely be a symptom of me not calming down and taking it slow but I was just wondering if anyone had tips about that bc its been killing me not being able to hit my ar shots (I use aim assist and sometimes it works but the nature of it being that I have to move my reticle unscoped a lot I end up wobbling all over the screen uncontrollably). Is there some way to help this? I know I could go do practices on creative maps and what not but I just feel so out of control and watch nick Mercs who has laser accuracy on high sense. I want to keep using the high sense bc I do feel as if it makes me better and maybe it’ll just come with time but if anyone had tips about that I’d appreciate it.

Im struggling with editing and I have no clue if my remapped edits are good so I’d love feedback on what people use for that. I know editing takes time and comes with practice I was more or less waiting to get used to my new jump bind to learn editing so I’ll soon start practicing on that. If there are any specific edits I should learn first I’d love to hear them. 

I also feel like I’ve really been struggling with build fights too, I always lose high ground and i know that comes with practice too, I’ve been practicing 90’s but everytime I trynin game I almost always end up putting a stair over my head and getting jump fatigue. I recently saw something about using floors in 90’s to help with that so I will likely try that soon. I think I need to work on my ramp rushes too bc I am not great at putting floor wall and stair down effectively. 

This really seems like just a long rant and i dont know if that’s allowed here or what I’m new to this sub and I really really just want to get better at the game, I have a bunch of friends who all just started playing and i know they are struggling and I worry they won’t want to play soon, so if I could be good enough to carry them I feel like they’d enjoy it a lot more and want to play more. Overall if there are any good console players that have an tips I’d love to hear them I just want to improve my game. Thanks a lot for reading and taking the time to reply I really appreciate it i know this was very long. 

TLDR: I’ve played a lot of fortnite but don’t feel like I’m getting much better, would love any tips or things to practice or settings from good console players. Thanks!!",FortniteCompetitive

&amp;#x200B;

* The ESL team were amazing to the players. They were treated like gold, from full media shoots, catered lunches/dinners etc. Everyone had a blast, and I hope we get to see ESL put on another show later in the year.
* The scoring format was incredible, and with a couple of tweaks I think it should be the format for all events moving forward. The difference between 1st and 2nd-5th should be a little more significant, and perhaps kills should be weighted slightly more for a Solo event, but overall this was a massive step forward.
* In my opinion, events NEED to follow the 14 games/2 day format. This not only promotes consistency, but allows story lines to develop. Would Zexrow and Vinny maintain their top spot? Would some of the under performing teams show up in day 2 etc. It was a ton of fun, games were highly competitive and the whole series was engaging. Really do believe this will be look back on as the foundation of Fortnite as a true esport.
* The casters did a FANTASTIC job explaining/teaching the more casual fan about what was happening, provided the perfect amount of energy in exciting situations and did their best to follow the story lines set up in day 1. Really excited to see what a cast looks like come world cup, these guys all put in a ton of work and it's really showing.
* As a community let's all let up on some of the teams who didn't perform over the weekend. This was a very stacked lobby and A LOT of things went on behind the scenes that were out of the control of the players. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, it was an amazing experience and despite some technical issues I think this should be looked at as a very positive  experience for everyone involved. Looking forward to World Cup!

Just because one atom of your character is ""phasing"" through a build shouldn't prevent it from being placed. I have a fix for this and I think that it's 100x times better than the current system. Make phasing a 50/50. Lets suppose that you and your opponent are in the same 1x1 and you place a ramp. IF your opponent has 50% or more of his hitbox below the ramp, then he will be pushed below the ramp and vice versa.

TLDR: how do pros/competitive players get to the next level? Pure playtime and their approach to the game?

Putting it as best as I can, I feel like I’m somewhat decent at the game when it comes down to it, but I really feel like I can break through and get to a more competitive level. I’m not talking the next new pro, I am just a bit down as I feel like I’ve hit a bit of a stand still in my personal improvement though I know I can do better. I feel like my strengths are my building and my macro movement, as well as awareness / tracking. I feel like my weaknesses/stuff I need to work on are aiming, decision making being a bit lazy when it comes to a ramp push or putting an extra layer in my turtle.  Stuff like this gets me down because I feel like I beat myself a majority of the time. The good part about that is that I can improve myself. The only problem is I feel like I’ve hit a wall over the last month or 2, just constantly playing pretty decent but I can’t break out. I do playground every day for just like 10-20 min, play at least 5-10 games a day on average. Tho I’ll go a day w/o playing then one day play quite a few hours. I keep getting 9-12 kill games, but pros nowadays are banging out 20+ with ease it seems. I just don’t know how to get out of this little rut of improvement I’m in. I know I have more potential that I’m just not tapping into.

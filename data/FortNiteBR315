Now I can't even aim at my enemy because my frames drop from 60 capped to like 20 or less as soon as someone shoots or anyone is near or I run or just in general whenever I play this game.
Before season 3 I played on 1080, everything on far or high. And I had like a stable 120+ fps
Ever since I was forced to reduce to 720p and EVERYTHING on low + vsync on or else its literally unplayable.

new skin is called block buster right

the definition of a block is ""the area bounded by four streets in a town or suburb""

and in the leaked week 8 challenges it shows the new skin with a [giant missile](https://i.redditmedia.com/QANIGkICXa4FBK9QaQIKq9ycvBqq0UG4MvzjmAxhKZY.jpg?w=1024&amp;s=cb4cb583bc8999626c7f980481f6b125)

a missile designed to penetrate deep into the ground or rock before exploding is called a bunker **BUSTER**

and Tilted towers fits the definition of a block right ([paint image](https://gyazo.com/f4d145d2c6ef1f58b7962d5f20f6eb31))

so therefore the blockbuster is going to ""block bust"" tilted towers in season 4 or 5

The change however didn't hurt double pumpers as much as you wanted. It hurt single pumpers the most. 

I'm not going to lie, I like using double pumps. But because of this, I'm able to deduct that I don't really care about the 10 damage nerf. Double pump is more prominent now that before because the headshot ratio made it so you need to follow up on a good headshot.

My proposed change: reduce the magazine size of pump shotguns to 1 and have the reload time be equal to the pump cooldown. Along side this, revert the damage and HS ratio of pump shotguns (keep them one shot one kill while keeping the tac shotguns weaker (I'd revert the damage but keep HS ratio at 2.0)).

This change makes double pumping much less viable (2 shots on about 1.4 second cooldown), without making shotguns clunky.

We have grown to love this game and have been enjoying every minute of it for quite some time now. But with every great journey there is always an ending. 

Unfortunately, this ending seems to be coming much sooner then I'd like, but like that say - the good die young. 

If you have been keeping up to date with the game and others games that are coming out, you probably already have an idea of what I'm taking about. Let's first talk about the last few updates which essentially broke the game. Nerfs to resource gathering? Added in broken thermal scope? 

Players like ninja are starting to lose interest. You can see while they play how uninterested they are. You can tell the game has become old to them, and that epic's updates are just not cutting it for us anymore. The game is as stagnant as ever, with a small but non convincing glimmer of hope to maybe save it from plummeting. 

You can even notice on twitch, that the game is slowly declining. 

Beside the poor updates and tedium towards the repetitive gameplay, other games are being released right now and in the future that do what fortnite does, but better. An example of this would be realm royale. Realm royale already is a top 4 steam game. Yes it's free to play, but it's blowing up. A lot of fortnite players have quit currently to try out the new BR game. 

The last example of a game taking the crown would be the soon to be released cod battle royale in the new black ops. 

I know it may not be free, but the call of duty franchise are the ones that are the most revolutionary. They made the staple respawn shooter - level up/perk ideas. I doubt treyarch, infinity ward or whom ever is working on the next call of duty will let us down 

I'm not saying I'd want a game like call of duty, or realm royale to take the spotlight, but unfortunately folks, that is how it's staring to look.

What I love about Fortnite is the customability and the beautiful graphics. At first I wasn’t a fan of the cartoon style graphics but I’ve grown to love them. The building is also a nice little addition that really makes this game unique. Anyway, super stoked to join this Reddit and I guess I’ll finally say:

Yep, fornite is mainly a KIDS game where many kids are secretly using parents credit cards to buy skins and are causing issues with kids schooling. 

Me personally, I'm 29 and started playing at original release (stw) and now I've stopped playing. It's a cash grab and a half, you get roped into buying skins and the battlepass and overtime that's going to add up way more than an actually full price game and DLC.

I bought both battlepasses and multiple skins but not anymore, I finally got fed up with the updates and change in combat and added items.

On the other hand, we have this extra loading screen where we can see the blockbuster skin where (SPOILER ALERT) \[he looks like he's launching the missile\], but this loading screen has something different than the others. There's no battlestar.

So one thing is for sure, we won't get this loading screen from the challenges. Maybe it's the screen for a LTM just like the Thanos one where you had a specific screen for that mode, who knows.

One they backed off skill based match-making because they were afraid regular queues would turn into a try-hard fest, and two LTM’s were supposed to be limited so regular queues stay saturated.



Now that Reddit has whinned so fucking hard that Epic is considering putting in 50s permanent so “people can learn” is doing nothing but starting a downward trend to this games downfall in my opinion. 50s gameplay is nothing like any other queue in the game. Learning there only hurts new players honestly when and if they ever try to mitigate over to regular queues.



They didn’t want to add SBMM so matches wouldn’t become sweaty, yet that is exactly what happens when all the noobs are playing 50s for their “easy challenges hehe” and “I’m learning”.


When 50s is up the average player has two options and that is it, play casual 50v50 or get wrecked in regular queue by try-hards. Either way by the end of the LTM I guarantee the average player isn’t having fun playing the game anymore. Maybe I’m just irritated that 50s has now been up for 2 months worth of time this year already....",FortNiteBR

I am at level 53 now and with my work (13 hrs a day) and being a parent and all there is too little time for me to give away for the grinding so i would like to know from the experienced ones about how XP is earned and what mode gives it off the most. My favorite mode to play alone are the 20vs20 and 50vs50 seeing how action packed they are and the occasional duos when my buddy is online. 
I have also heard that each star after tier 100 on the battle pass = XP (i am at almost 75 i guess now), and the tiers are purchasable through the store, so does it mean that i can buy XP after i reach 100 on the battle pass?
Sorry for the long post and thank you in advance for the replies. ",FortNiteBR

I believe the concept of Realm Royale (the idea of spells and such) poses a strong threat to Fortnite when it comes to a potential competitive scene. The game style limits camping and meta’s such as turtling, leading to more engaging gameplay and fast paced matches. 

Obviously RR is still in it’s early days when it comes to game mechanics and graphics, however Fortnite was much the same only a short time ago.

In season 4 this has all changed.  Not only have the tactics changed but so have the players.  There are far less noobs for one.  Noobs who couldn't make the cut quit the game and the other noobs got good.  Good players got much better.  Now getting 4 kills is a decent game to me whereas before 4 kills wasn't shit. The most kills I have had so far in season 4 is like 10.  Personally I don't like turbobuild, as a player I was always more of a shooter than a builder.  It's not that I am a bad builder I'm a pretty good one but it's just not a playstyle I like I prefer focus on shooting.  How can I adapt to season 4 and what about my tactics and strategy do i need to change to get back to being as dominant as i was in season 3?",FortNiteBR

You build a ramp to let you and 4 teammates launch pad to get out of the storm. Some kid thinks of an EPIC MAEMAE TO POST ON REDDIT! He knocks down the ramp and downs 5 of his own teammates, emotes over and over and runs off to let them die in the storm.

Little Timmy sees his teammate is building a 1by1 under a loot drop. Little Timmy wants the loot though, so he knocks down the tower with C4 to make sure his teammate doesnt get the loot, damaging him 35 HP in the process.

9 year old Ricardo sees his teammate has a Scar. He screeches and yells into his mic, demanding he get it. His teammate mutes him and goes on top of high ground on a hill. Ricardo finds some impulse grenades and decides to knock his teammate off to kill him. He builds a 1by1 and waits for him to die, then takes his loot.

Most importantly, I feel like this game got too popular, maybe we're the ones killing it. Too many children making it look bad, as well as garbage YouTubers, the oversaturation of generic streamers, the game seriously lost all of the magic it had when it got popular.
That might sound like a pretentious thing to say but I really think that we need to go back and stop changing everything, change isn't always great... I remember when shotguns were balanced, building was fun to learn, camping as a noob was the normal way to play, but now it's just children and/or sweaty tryhards that are ruining the game.
There's nothing that epic can really do, but if anything I hope they go back to their roots in Season 5, stop adding a ton of new things that end up breaking the game more.
I know most early players agree with me that Season 4 was a little bit of a letdown, and it's much too easy to get to the final tier without even trying... and now with all of these battle Royale games coming out, I think it's safe to say that it can only go downhill from here unless Fortnite goes back to what it used to be.
Obviously some changes were great! 60fps, the map change added more unique places to land, and Season 3 was phenomenal! Season 4 so far is really lacking for me, nothing feels special and it's all just kinda boring.",FortNiteBR

- You build a wall right in front of somebody about to shoot their RPG, and it blows up in their face. Your wall caused them to die, but you don't get credit for it.

- You deal white damage to somebody who then dies from the storm.

- You deal white damage to somebody who then falls to their death (this is a major one, happens all the time in build battles).

- You deal damage to somebody, who then rage quits the game (this is more of a joke, but I had it happen to me once, lol).

In my opinion, if you've recently dealt damage to somebody who then ends up killing themselves, you should get the kill. Maybe make it white damage only for fall damage deaths or storm deaths giving kill credit, since shield damage doesn't matter in that scenario. ",FortNiteBR

I will try to explain the things i have completed, kindly comment any doubts regarding this breakdown.
Season 4 Duration - 70 Days
Stars everyday - 5

Breakdown for tiers to reach Omega.

Levels 100 

Level Breakdown:
1 TO 2 - 2 Stars
2 TO 3 - 2 Stars
3 TO 4 - 2 Stars
4 TO 5 - 5 Stars
5 TO 6 - 2 Stars
6 TO 7 - 2 Stars
7 TO 8 - 2 Stars
8 TO 9 - 2 Stars
9 TO 10 - 10 Stars
10 TO 11 - 2 Stars
*I haven taken the 10 to 11 quota also because you start at season level 1 and not 0, but while leveling up to do need go from 10 to 11, 20 to 21 etc. Hence this addition*

Total Stars for 10 level ups - 31 
Therefore till level 81 - 31 x 8 = 248

Meaning 24.8 Tiers from reaching Level 81

Weekly Challenges Breakdown :
One week - 60 Stars (50 from challenge and 10 from Blockbuster Challenge)
Total Stars for 7 Weeks - 60 x 7 = 420 ^Blaze ^it

Meaning 42 Tiers from completing weekly challenges

Total for only reaching 81 and 7 weeks - 66.8 Tiers.

Daily Challenges Breakdown :

For 7 weeks -&gt; 50 days 
There was a change for the weekly challenge from Tuesday to thurday and the week 7 will be active till 21st June, 2018. I have taken that into consideration.
50 x 5 = 250 Stars
Meaning 25 Tiers from completing daily challenges

Total for daily, weekly and season levels - 91.8

Additional Tiers Breakdown : 
Battlepass Promise (Season 3 Battlepass Owners only) - 50 Stars
Bugged challenge for watching a replay (was reviving teammates instead) - 5 Stars
Saved Challenges from previous season - 15 stars
Starter Challenges (Free for everyone) - 20 Stars
Therefore total Stars - 90

Meaning 9 tiers from additional events.

Total - 100.8

Mean you can get it on Tuesday of week 7 if you done everything mentioned above. 
Hope this can clear things up from the mention of getting full omega from my last post. 
Thank you for reading this and hope this helps clear confusion. ",FortNiteBR

Instantly killing an enemy in the face of defeat because you want the team to lose a player or two and make everybody unhappy by providing a disadvantage  and the dead players having to sit and watch. The whole idea of the full-killing, BMing, finishing, or whatever you and your friends call it mechanic is to provide a tactical advantage by allowing the player to get that better weapon, more mats/ammo/heals, or to prevent the enemy team from getting the rez off in the occasional down time during a fight. This “advantage” is situational. For example you down and enemy and then gain the high ground, but don’t where the enemies teammates are, but you see them crawling to safety to be rezed so you kill them. That creates an advantage because it prevents you from having to fight against four or two enemies making it a lesser amount. These tactical advantage situations aren’t used that frequently and instead it’s mid-fight finishing because the player is kill hungry and likes seeing that number go up or just wants to piss off a few people momentarily. 
Here’s some solutions:
1) take it out of the game and replace it a mechanic which makes it so when the enemy player is downed all of their loot is dropped, but you cannot kill the player. This allows for the advantage of getting the better weapon or more stuff for whatever fight you are in still a thing. However, this does take out the preventing the Rez factor. This would be beneficial for both parties. This makes it so if the enemy takes the loot you dropped, but your teammates wipe who’s left, you still get your stuff back and whatever better things the enemies may have had. It also allows for your teammates to better their loot for the fight they are in or get those extra heals. In addition, it also puts something else for enemy teams to fight over. Personally, this seems like a very nice fix. However, just like any other new thing, it would have to be tested in order to see the impact it has on the game. 

2) provide a grace period for the downed player. Basically, this is a 5 to 10 second period where the downed player is immune to all damage from weapons, but still takes the normal slow 2 tick health reduction. The player still would take damage from falling and the storm. After the time is up, the player is fair game to weapon damage identical to how it is in the current state. This keeps the advantages, but gets rid of the instakilling a downed enemy. 

3) some sort of combination of the two previously listed. 

As usual, any more ideas are welcomed. I would love to see this game mechanic geared more to providing the methodical approach to a fight instead of the annoyance it provides for all players. Thank you to all those who  took the time to read and consider all of this:) ",FortNiteBR

In solo or squad or whatever it can be over so quick. You get all looted up then; bam! It's over. You get little to no experience using the weapons and building and such. Half the time it's a quick shotgun death or something.

In 20v20 it's so much easier to stay alive and actually have an on going impact. If you stay with the group you'll be building all the time, taking long range AR and sniper shots, using explosives all time, and building huge forts. I actually get excited if I get some good items like a rocket launcher or a scoped AR since I know ill be using them.

My buddy got a Fortnite magazine that had almost everything you need to know about Fornite (BR&amp;StW). There was a poster in the magazine that showed the whole map along with descriptions of every location. I thought it looked sick at a glance then I started scrutinizing each location and noticed something different. The first thing I noticed was that Junk Junction was completely different (yes, one of my favorite spots is junk. Links to pictures of what I am talking about will be below).
After scanning every location, I found that there were multiple locations that were different. The main ones I noticed were Junk Junction, Pleasant Park, Greasy Grove, and Lonely Lodge. One thing I want to point out is that I understand that this poster definitely does not have the amount of detail like the in-game map. With that being said, there can be speculation on the accuracy of this poster-map.
But here is where it gets interesting. Some of the descriptions of the locations *do not* match what they currently are. Take a look for yourself:

*Junk Junction*
https://imgur.com/vOkEDDY

Make a 1st person LTM, doesn't need to be perfect. Or one with no building at all. Or even one where we have 20 inventory slots and infinite ammo, it doesn't matter. At the end of the day it's LIMITED TIME, so even if everyone hates it we just have to wait a couple days for something new.

With a Nintendo Switch release most likely coming very soon, it is probable that Switch/Xbone crossplay will happen, but not Switch/PS4. We as a community really need to show Sony that we want the ability to play with our friends regardless of what console they play on.

Heavy shotties do more damage but are far more rare, while pumps do a good deal of damage and are decently common. 1 single pump is far less viable than before since max damage is 170. Double pump/double shotgun became far more necessary from that because there is no real counter at all. 

This isn’t a hate post inspired by me being double pumped/not being able to double pump properly; I can consistently double pump and usually beat people using it, but this nerf to pumps made me need to carry double pump even more simply because the nerf made double pump more necessary. 

This has surely been said before (I personally haven’t seen it but I have no doubt that others have made this argument several times a day on this sub) but it just needs to be out there. A fix that I’d like for double pump would be to make pumping necessary. As it’s presumably coded right now, “pumping” is just a shooting delay. If the need to pump was added to the shotgun’s characteristics then it would make carrying two or more shotguns viable, but they wouldn’t be able to be used until that pump went through, even if they switched weapons.

This brings some interesting strategy to your loadout instead of being able to hoard a bunch.

Small bullets: pistols, smg, minigun
medium: revolver, lmg, AR/burst
Heavy: hand cannon, sniper, hunting rifle
Shotgun: pump, heavy, tac
Rockets: grenade launcher or grenade launcher

The idea to use the “playground” LTM to help noobs learn this stuff will help but would not help with how to play in real game situations. 

The idea is to have a separate queue for new players that have not won a game in the regular solos mode. Once a player has won a game in the regular solos mode the noob queue will no longer be available to the player. 

Other things can be done such as adding 10+ or 50+ win queues for better players. This would make for a more exclusive  competitive LTM. 

I think this will help new players find more enjoyment and keep them from getting frustrated and stop playing the game.

I play it everyday, I have fun everyday, I enjoy it everyday. Im not saying the game is bad, the game is incredible. Just wanted to get that out of the way. 

First, The Jetpack.  I know its leaving the game just a few hours from now, but to me, the addition of the Jetpack in the first place was horrible. Epic Games needs to do a better job of adding these gimicky items into the game by testing them better before theyre released to the public or by simply just not adding them in the first place. 

• The ability to sit 12 stories up knowing you wont take fall damage is incredibly advantageous. 

• The ability to lose highground and then just fly up and over and get angles on players that you wouldnt otherwise be able to achieve is incredibly advantageous.

• The ability to build a 1by1 10 stories high with Turbo Build + a Jetpack in under 5 seconds is again, you guessed it...incredibly advantageous. 

• My final point on the Jetpack is that its a Legendary rarity item &amp; the drop rate seems to be that of an Uncommon rarity. 

Secondly, the COUNTLESS nerfs to materials and farming in general. 

• 33% less Mats early game matters, period. Dropping the floor loot from 30 to 20 materials doesnt make remotely ANY sense to me whatsoever. 

• decreasing the amount of wood you get off of Trees in a game thats main mechanic is revolved around building again makes zero sense. 


Next, The Shotgun Nerf and the inconsistency with Shotguns in general. 

• Shotguns were already inconsistent. Players complained countless times about 8 damage, 9 damage Tac Shots. Some players just missed, some players hit people straight on, whatever side of the fence youre on, I would atleast like to believe we could all agree that Shotguns have been inconsistent since Day 1. 

• Tac Shotty was already incredibly weak, ESPECIALLY the Grey Tac Shotty, which in my humble opinion is the WORST gun in the entire game that is an absolute necessity (Shotguns in general that is.) now its even worse and Tac Shotguns as a whole are even worse. Let me get this straight. 

- Weakest Shotgun to begin with.
- Random Pellet Spread which leads to high inconsistency even at point blank. 
- Couldnt 1 shot people in the head before and it cant 1 shot people to the head now. (Shields involved of course.) 
- and lastly it lacks in medium range shotgun fights and long range shotgun fights.

Yet Epic Games thought it made sense to make them EVEN WORSE. Hmmm. 

The Pump Shotgun, This one I see from both sides of the fence. A highly skilled player outbuilds somebody, 1 pumps them in the head, moves on. Great. However, for new players or just straight up bad players, not even having a chance once you get pumped could probably get repetitive and boring. I have no sympathy for these players because with all due respect, I put in hours, you put in hours, if my building and shotgun accuracy is better than yours I personally believe I should be able to 1 pump you all day long. But I DO see it from both sides regardless of me not having sympathy for those players. 

Heavy Shotguns: 

• Add them to floor loot now that all the other shotguns have been nerfed to death.

• Dont have much to say other than its incredibly OP and wasnt needed AT ALL, the 400 damage radius was already strong, 600 damage radius is just overkill &amp; completely destroys entire towns. They should be reverted back to 400. 

Dusty Divot, Crack Rocks, Cosmetics and Season 4 as a whole: 

Dusty is getting better with the slight addition of the trees and I’m excited to see what it turns into when its all said and done, but in its current state its MASSIVE, only 20% of the MASSIVE area is lootable, and the other 80% is filled with Crack Rocks that ive become accustomed too but in my opinion they just shouldnt be in the game. (Another item that allows you to build WILDLY high without any risk of fall damage.) thats incredibly advantageous in certain situations. 

Season 4 Cosmetics: 

• This is totally an opinion thing, but I dont think any of them are good outside maybe 1-2 of the skins. The Twitch Prime and battle pass skins have been far better than any skin theyve released this season. 


They need to keep the core of the game the same &amp; with every update theyre trying to change meta, theyre changing flow of the game, consistency, etc. I dont agree with that at all. ",FortNiteBR

This is what I think epic should be working towards and this shotgun nerf totally backfires imo. The pump is nerfed for the 4th time (re-pump, swap delay, headshot damage reduced, damage reduced). I don’t understand why they do this. I think the pump was almost reasonably balanced in its high reward for headshot damage with its long reload time. It is the hardest gun to use in fortnite and yet again they nerfed it. The only positive thing I can say about heavy shotguns is their typically consistent with damage. This is what the pump and tac needed, not a nerf. The pellet spread needs to be more predictable. The same two shots with half the crosshairs on the target do different damage amounts as far as anyone knows and that’s how they need to fix the shotguns, not by taking away headshot multiplier. The same two shots as I just mentioned should be within 5-10 dmg of each other every time.",FortNiteBR

Now, how does this connect to the block buster skin in battle royale?

So far, every skin in this event has been previously released on battle royale. First we've got raven in the events tab, and we've got carbide as part of the quests. And  if I had to guess, this is either a skin coming to the item shop or the blockbuster skin. I mean like come on, it looks amazing and they can't not put it in battle royale. Not to mention the fact that it's literally called ""blockbuster"" and ""uncover the origins of a mythic hero"".

Might be wrong, but I'm hoping this is the blockbuster skin because imo it looks awesome. What do you think of my theory? is it good or is it too far\-fetched?

We've made some fairly substantial changes to the subreddit rules! Our subreddit is currently seeing 200,000,000 page views per month, around the likes of subreddit's with 18,000,000 subscribers! We've had a huge increase in traffic and both the game and the community are still growing at a rapid pace, and a part of our solution to remedy that was our recent addition of new moderators. We've recently launched a competitive subreddit (r/FortniteCompetitive) to allow for the competitive/esports scene to have it's own community to grow too! Last but not least, with the launch of r/FortniteBRMeta, we have seen a large amount of feedback that we have incorporated into the following rules update.

# [Rules found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/rules)

I want to go over the large changes with you all:

---


## Witch Hunting has been clarified:

I'd like to highlight the following addition to the rule: 

&gt; Posts on community figures and public organizations plus their employees are allowed, as long as the posts are civil and do not post personal/confidential information. Posts of clickbait social media titles are not allowed.

We have seen some community figures come under light, and the team has decided that if they chose to put their name out there as a community figure, it is not witch hunting to point out something in a civil manner. We will continue to monitor this and see how it progresses as the community and competitive scene continue to grow.


##Posts Should Be High Quality And Encourage Discussion

&gt; We want /r/FortniteBR to be the best source of discussion for the game online - and to do that we have to ensure that quality content isn’t drowned out by low effort or low-quality submissions. Content must be related to Fortnite. If your post contains a suggestion for the game, it must contain Fortnite elements.

We have done some significant changes to this section of the rules, this one included. We want to make what we consider relevant to Fortnite more clear, and have included specific guidelines in this rule, if you'd like to see, feel free to review the full rules page. If a post uses Fortnite elements (in game assets, similar looking style inspired by Fortnite, etc.) and is a proper, high quality original post, it is what we are looking for.

##Frequently Posted Topics

&gt; Please use the search before posting about something. Topics that become excessive and or redundant due to being posted with an abnormal frequency are subject to removal. “Breaking news” style topics are included in this. We will only allow one thread per topic, with Epic and Moderator threads taking priority.

We are introducing a new wiki page, called [Epic Plz](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/epicplz), this page will be a list of everything that the community has overwhelmingly posted in support of, be it any type of change. It will hopefully be a resource for everyone who visits our subreddit. If something is posted there, it will not be allowed without a new development or in depth assessment that approaches the topic from a new angle. It is not strictly forbidden, but keep in mind that a typical ""epic plz"" post in this wiki has already seen it's own plethora of discussion. 

This is also where we are moving duplicate topics into, Epic and Moderator topics regarding ""big hits"" will take priority, but the first well written post will be the one that stays. Nothing is changing regarding our stance on duplicate topics, we want to keep the subreddit free of reposts.

## Low-Effort/Low-Quality Humor Is Not Allowed.

&gt; ### Low-Effort/Low-Quality Humor Is Not Allowed. 

&gt; We all enjoy a good laugh, especially about Fornite! We have a high standard for humor; attempts at humor need to have some effort put into them so that the community can find more value in discussing and developing any humor created on our subreddit.

&gt; **Humor must be original/user created**

&gt; * This means that all humor must be created by you, and not a template, formula or something similar. Show off your creativity! 
&gt; * No low resolution, pixelated or [""deep fried""](https://www.google.com/search?q=deep+fried+memes&amp;client=firefox-b-1-ab&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwivmKj7oMXbAhUow1kKHV6JCRsQ_AUICigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=966) images, gifs or videos.

&gt; **Humor can't be simple ""pastes""**
 
&gt; * This means copy and pasting assets from Fortnite onto something non-game related is not allowed. If it took you a few minutes to make, it is likely not high quality.
&gt; * There has to be a minimal level of effort into creating something new.
 * If something was made in Paint and is noticeably done so, it is subject to removal.

&gt; **Humor posts can't overly saturate the front page**

&gt; * If the community is overwhelmingly jumping on board to a new meme/topic, and it becomes a trend that floods the subreddit, they are eligble to be removed as low effort/spam posts.
&gt; * If they become too commonplace as a trend they will be eligible to be removed as spam/low effort.

We wanted to approach how funny posts, memes and videos are allowed on our subreddit. We are still assessing these type of posts, but want to clarify this and separate our low quality posts from what we seek out of humor, this should hopefully make the rules a bit more clear on what type of meme-esque posts, and ""bandwagon"" joke posts we allow. These rules largely speak for themselves, but we would love to hear your feedback regarding it!

## Promotion &amp; Give-A-Ways

We have clarified our stance on give-a-ways and promotional content, this is to help improve the experience for everyone and prevent individuals from using the subreddit as an avenue merely for promotional content.

&gt; ""It's perfectly fine to be a redditor with a website, it's not okay to be a website with a reddit account."" - Confucius.

&gt; That inspirational and highly relevant quote was ripped straight from reddit's self-promotion wiki page. It's well worth a read. In order keep the subreddit free of advertisement, we enforce a strict 10:1 rule which states:

&gt; For every one promotional or giveaway post you submit, 10 high-quality comments or submissions should be non-promotional. High-quality comments must provide a meaningful response and may not be on your own posts.

&gt; All promotion posts must abide by our low-quality rules (No clickbait, no all caps titles, etc.)

&gt; Read our promotion wiki page to find out what we consider promotional content.

&gt; You also may also only make one promotional post every 3 days and any giveaway must be approved by the moderation team ahead of time.

## Other small notes

We've made wording changes, clarifications all around the ruleset. None remaining should be too impactful. Feel free to [review them at any time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/wiki/rules)",FortNiteBR

However, people who missed that season really want that skin. 

So how about they re-release skull trooper in October, but his design is different, like maybe he has glow in the dark bones. Players who have the original skin will be able to interchange between the two, like changing the armor on carbide, but players who didnt get the original one can still get a skull trooper, just not the ORIGINAL Skull trooper.

Nothing funny, random or helpful here. Just I’ve been trying real hard to get good at this game for months and months and sometimes I’m lucky to just get one kill. Been practising on 20v20s most of the day, and just played my first game with 4 kills, then immediately after I got 5 kills (7 knocked, 5 eliminated) I’ve only ever played GTA before this game and I’ve never been a great player, just along for the ride, but this was so much fun. I felt proud, and that I had achieved something after all the hours I’ve put into the game. I’m that much of a bad player I still play with the original controls! I’m just pissed you can’t watch the replays on the 20v20s Cos I wanted to show my bf. 

Anyway. Today was a good day. And if you’re worried you’re never gonna “get good” just try to have fun, and practice being super aggressive in the 50v50s/20v20s Cos there’s lots of people to practise picking off. I’d never have gotten so many kills in a normal mode! ",FortNiteBR

Ghost ramping,Shotgun nerf(Shotguns are broken and most of the time deal 8/17 damage), Ghost ramping, People killing me through closed doors/placed walls(I'm sure most of you encountered this one),Mats nerf(Which in my opinion was useless but i know most of you don't care what i think), FPS Lag(Since of the recent updates the game has be unrealistically laggy which makes it so bad for gameplay) and last but not least the useless items/things they are adding to the game(But that's understandable they want to expand their game and add new things to it)

Those are the reasons im quitting fortnite for now. If they keep breaking their game like that and not listening to their community they will lose alot of players. And i know you guys will say that no one cares about your opinion or some shit like that or that i can't play the game and that's why i'm quitting but yeah just wanted to give out my opinion. 

Good luck with the game in the future

I haven't touched normal modes because of the slow material gathering and just been playing Blitz because of that. Blitz feels way more fun, and competitive.

- Construction 🚧 

People through my wall and ramp ? WHY ? why Epics Game ? When I put a wall I want to block the ennemis that’s logic no ? delete the collision. 

- Items

Cart shopping is cool but for 1 or 2 weeks same for the jetpack. You can under the map with the Cart shopping so please put this items just for 2 weeks. 

-Mode 

Where is the 1v1 or 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 ? all people want this. That’s cool you can play funny with you friend and do some battle build. Please do that. 

I know Epics Game want to change something and add news to the game but please don’t change the mechanic because every seasons I learn the new mechanic and I’m really Tired.

Im not sure about anyone else, but I only rotate stairs when im going to try and get down from something, and 100% of the time I would like my stairs back to normal afterwards. This option would eliminate the need for people to rotate pieces back to normal.

Also even more importantly, this would make the automatic rotation glitch less frustrating. Once in a while my stairs will be rotated without my control, it would be so much faster to just switch to my weapon and back really quick and have it reset, then fumble trying to triple tap the rotate button while in a fight.

Around 70% of my fights end with a person dying from a shotgun, I understand its supposte to be a close quarter high power weapon but when it dominates so much the game like that theres a problem, i love the smgs (the silenced one not so much its doo doo) but it just cant compete with shotguns at close range and ARs at medium range, imo it also removes a certain skill out of the game when u can be super accurate with shotgun but still get 1 shotted because the opponent got the better RNG so limiting it to 180 damage which is 90% if your potential health is fair imo. 

I feel like all weapons should be balanced enough that we can choose whichever of them and still have a good chance of winning the fight


ps please increase material drops from harversting its extremley boring to mine trees all day and makes it very stale

another thing i would love seeing is the circle before ppl drop so in mid game theres more action since the mid game period atm is soo boring its like 5-6 minutes of running around doing nothing",FortNiteBR

So we decided that since epic are attempting to wash out the current meta we said maybe they did a another secret nerf on shotguns we didnt know about (we knew about 2.5× to 2.0× on headshots and shit)

We thought hmmmmmm.... what other good close range weapons are there? Revolvers... trash. Deagles... quite rare and quite unreliable. Pistols... clip is too small and spray and recoil is *IMMENSE*. Oh! Smgs. Silenced is better for medium range as theres not enough spray for point blank fights. Tactical smgs! The recoil isnt too bad (at least from what ive noticed. Or the recoil is consistent it doesnt keep jerking up like a pistol) the spray isnt TOO bad, it is perfect for close range because sometimes you need a bit of rng for them way-too-close fights and the clip is nice and **THICC.** 

we went into a match with it and im not sure if it just got better or it seems better cuz shotguns are dog sheit now but we came 3rd (cuz me and my friend are trash. Ironically we both got one pumped from 150 *hehe*) but my friend had 2 kills and i had 4 [which is above average for me tbh ;)] . Ever since that 2-hours-ago i have been refusing to pick up shotguns and i havent won a fight since.

Nah, honestly i think smgs are super good now and they ***MELT*** at point blank

P.S. i also went to loot lake and got 6 kills with a grey suppressed smg. I was doing the slow clap inside the cave under the main house just round the corner a valor came in with a shotgun and i shredded her and proceeded to do the slow clap once again. If you are the unlucky valor who got shredded by an elite agent a few days ago im sorry. Im sure ill find the person as it doesnt happen very often...",FortNiteBR

They keep on changing aspects of the game no one complained about like the shotgun damage decrease so you can no longer one pump someone. Here are some things I would like to see changed.

Change the pump and tactical damage to what they use to be 

Nerf RPGs and grenade launchers  

Nerf the amount of space C4s explode

Fix the bug when players can clip through your walls, stairs, ext.

Remove the Jet\-pack ASAP

Change the amount of materials that spawn on floors and chests to 50 instead of 20

Nerf the amount of damage a trap does from 150 to 100

Remove tilted or make it smaller

Make the tactical shotgun more consistent

And most importantly STOP ADDING STUPID SHIT TO THE GAME 

I've probably missed a fair amount of problems in the game so feel free to post your ideas in the comments also I still enjoy the game and think Epic are a great company and they are always looking at the community's ideas and feed back to make the game more enjoyable which I do respect as you don't see many developers do that anymore.",FortNiteBR

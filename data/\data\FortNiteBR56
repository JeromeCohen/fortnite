So, bring back the Siphon/Pop-Up mechanics, and make Arena/Tournament mode more appealing to pros, like getting rid of the Baller for those ridiculous end games, or when a new item is released, wait for a majority vote, like for the new explosive bow, wait for pros to give an opinion on it, and if (in example) people like it more than hate it, put it in Arena/Tournament, and vice-versa.

&amp;#x200B;

My response:

&amp;#x200B;

 Healthy for the game? they completed destroyed pub solos, he said sooo much bullshit in one vid that's crazy. Well I guess he is the same guy that just for some retweets and so more money he immediately forget his ""word"" and ""honor"" about not buying again skins and the rest of the turnarounds he has made.. Just because he is the top streamer now  doesn't mean he is always right kids. And a guy who's word or honor is subject to 100k retweets or whatever isn't to be taken seriously. Yeah right dummy Tfue , Dakotaz ,sypher,tim, ninja etc they all want Fortnite to die and you are the one that wants to salvage Fortnite, but i forgot we casuals should make fortnite our 9-5 job like you in order to enjoy a shield-less and no mats game or not play aggro at all in case our shield gets taken away or be third partied even worst than before . Honestly his arrogance and hypocrisy went above any limit on his last vid.   Great player for sure but his attitude with the success has changed tons. (Even made made his past broadcasts as i saw for subs only, damn that sweet dollars really show the true colours of a man)

Sorry for bad formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile

1. Make stinks purple again and then lower the max stack count to 3. If you have 6 of them you can literally just choose a person to kill. It‚Äôs kind of overpowered in my opinion and provides an unfair advantage since I get 6 of them the more often than I should. I get my fair share of kills with them but I can see they are very annoying since there really isn‚Äôt a counter besides run away or push the guy after taking 15+ damage at least.

2. Remove the heavy sniper completely from arena. A weapon that can one shot people as well as walls has no place in competitive since it is used mostly within 100m and has basically no bullet drop. Not to mention if you‚Äôre a duo and you both have them you can easily double snipe someone with it.

3. Add guns next to all bullet spawns. It‚Äôs rare but it does happen where I will land and find literally 4 bullet spawns and then some bandages before I run into a guy with a blue pump.

4. Lower dynamite cap to 6. 9 dynamite is honestly stupid. The other day I had a game where a duo close to my box threw like 7 dynamite and 6 stinks on top of my box. Probably the most annoying thing I‚Äôve ever experienced on the game. I was left at 65 health after the whole thing went off. There‚Äôs no counter really besides maybe jump padding.

5. remove balloons, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen then used in my 50+ arena games.

Bonus: make mats on kill be delivered into your inventory so if you kill someone late game but he dies in the storm because he got downed you can pick up those 15 extra builds and gain an advantage for picking up that kill. 

That‚Äôs all I can really think of for now but any other suggestions that are good down below I will definitely add up here. Arena and pubs should be viewed differently and therefore should have different loot pools. I think arena mode is definitely a huge step in the right direction for competitive Fortnite but the system can always be improved.

No, this is not an april fools joke or something, what happened to Team Rumble, where's the teamwork? Where's the bots?
Honestly worse than normal games.
I played 4 games today, in every one of them, my team lost with 20 points less than the other team
And this isnt only today, every match I've played yesterday, and the day before and before, I had to kill 20 people to win, when my team mates got from 0 to 5 kills each.
I did this with a friend, we won every match instead of one, in all of them, we had to get 40 kills together.
How does that make sense?

This game is almost a year and a half old.

Twitter screenshots on the other hand are another level of low effort. This sub looks down on Twitter because they steal suggestions for likes. But this subreddit it doing the exact same thing when they screenshot streamers tweets and say stuff like ‚ÄúI agree with Daquan, Dakotaz, Lachlan, etc.‚Äù The only difference however is that the sub actually credits the person who said it but I digress.

Personally, Fortnite lost my interest simply because they keep changing the game. I appreciate updates and think they allow games to stay fresh, but there comes a time when leaving certain things alone is just as good as an update. 

If something isn‚Äôt broke, don‚Äôt fix it. We all know this saying. But it seems like the devs listen a little too much to the community and don‚Äôt rely on what got them here in the first place.

Im remember back then only John Wicks were able to build this fast but today even Noskins build a fitty feet tower in like 5 seconds. They ascend in lightspeed to the top duh while im not even able to build my first little square box.

I saw they reverted the changes and was disappointed but figured eh whatever we played for a year like that and it was fine, hopefully everyone is still enjoying being back. I get home yesterday and no one was on fortnite, I asked why... they all said the game is boring af again. So I convinced them to get on and after a few matches everyone was like, yeah ok who wants to play apex.

I have been playing this game since season one and I can confidently say this game is going downhill. So let‚Äôs discuss. I have some Major concerns about the state of the game at this point:
Weapon Variety
Turtling
Bugs in the game
State of Ranked and Casual.
The World Cup


Weapon Variety:
The state of Assault Rifles is fine in my opinion. A player can use even a grey AR and be very successful don't meddle in something that is good. However I will like to see a Golden version of the Heavy AR.
Pump is the only viable shotgun. If two equal skilled players fight and one person use a Pump and the other uses a Tactical shotgun 90% of the time the person with the pump will win. No one can deny this. In my opinion The Tac needs a huge buff. It needs to do at least 100 body damage and needs to have the potential of 200 damage (Not a very high chance of it). It also needs to get a slight accuracy buff and be given severe drop off. Another solution might be to increase structure damage but i am not sure how that will work out.
SMGs are perfect the way they are but I think it might need a little buff. (Later discussed on State of Turtling)
Pistols need to be buffed so that they can compete with SMGs to give variety to the META and give more options for people to use. The pistols (If they are in the game. Not sure) needs to increase their ammo capacity and needs reduced bloom. It also needs massive structure damage buff. The Flintknock is the only viable pistol in my opinion and the handcannon needs long range damage buff or no damage drop off.

Turtling:
Turtling is way too overpowered at this state. If a good player is in a box they will be almost unstoppable. They need to add more anti turtling weapons. This is why stink bombs are quite good in this Meta. The only way to counter turtling at this point is explosives, stinks and minigun and most people wouldn't be happy to carry stinks, dynamite over heals so they need to add another inventory slot. (Not my idea Tfue‚Äôs)We need a new inventory slot for grenades so they can carry maximum 3 tactical items and all grenades needs to be classified as tactical items. The tactical items should be tools to take a turtle out of a box so I don‚Äôt care if miniguns and explosive weapons are removed from ranked but explosives should remain in casual modes. This will also fix people carrying too much grenades.

Bugs in the Game:
They need to have a patch which is dedicated to fixing bugs once a month. This needs to happen. They need to add no new weapons in this patch and just have this to fix issues in the game. This patch should be used in tournaments rather than the latest patch and arena mode needs to run on this bug fixing patch until the next bug fixing patch. Then competitive integrity will be kept. The new guns they add throughout the month can be added to ranked mode in the bug fixing patch depending on the feedback from the COMPETITIVE community.

Pros vs Casuals:
The casuals and the Pros need to be split. The arena mode is a step in the right direction but they need to add squads for arena mode. The siphon mechanics need to go into the casual mode again. The real reason for this change was to stop casuals from leaving and create a safe space in which casuals can have fun but changing core mechanics in the game between modes is not the way to do it. If you want to fix casual modes add respawning which you have been working on. See the community feedback and add it to the ranked mode if you want but respawning needs to be in the casual gamemodes.The main resin you removed siphon was to reduce thirsting but it still happens. To counter thirsting add respawning vans. Outright copy apex legend if you want to. The differences in ranked and casual should be simple. The loot pools should change. Just like MonsterDFace said in this his new video the players should spawn with a new grey shotgun which does 50 damage to the body and 100 damage to the head at extreme close ranges and this gun should break after shooting 10 times. Maybe even spawn with 50 wood. The casual mode should be used as the testing grounds before adding new guns to the ranked mode as discussed in bug fixing section. Only balanced guns should be in ranked and casual can have all sorts of silly guns but competitive integrity should be saved. Casual mode needs to be a place to have fun and be silly and competitive needs to be a place to win. The mobility available to casual and ranked mode needs to change. Casuals can have all sorts of fun mobility but reduce mobility in the game overall if you want to slow down gameplay of casuals. The ranked mode needs to have only the most balanced mobility and at this point only the quadcrasher. Ranked mode needs to have 100% gun and chest spawn rates to reduce RNG as much as possible and even add set storm patterns and bus patterns for competitive which pros can memorize. Do anything to reduce RNG and increase skill. 


The World cup:
This needs a huge overhaul. All streamers from organizations from each region should fight in custom games and top 25 needs to be selected. There should also be online qualifiers for each region which will also accept 25 players from each region. This will be the qualifiers and pros who qualified shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to fight at the online qualifiers. Then the the pros who won the custom games from each region needs to have a lan fight and the top 50 from these people need to go to the finals. The online qualifier winners from each region should also have a LAN fight and that top 50 players also needs to qualify into the finals. This will be semifinals. The Pros and the online qualifiers needs to fight it out and the winner gets the price.All the custom games needs to be streamed by fortnite and the LAN should be a live event for both online qualifier and pros who qualified. This is a far superior approach because people like to see their favorite competitive org to fight. And if the online qualifiers get into the top 25 from each region they will get good publicity. The point system also needs to reflect consistency and not player who pop off only in one match to be put down by the more consistent player. 
The world cup at this stage doesn‚Äôt reflect consistency so in my opinion the game is not ready for the world cup.
Content they add to the game:
Please stop adding useless items. Add more innovative ones like the flintknock with interesting skill gap and also try to innovate building and editing rather than just adding guns.

Please share this with everyone and make sure epic sees this. The game needs to be saved.
If you have any opinions comment and I will respond. Please be very open minded in the comments.

How fun would it be to partake in battle as Kyle, or AC, or Ken? Being able to use emotes with EVERY STW hero would be a very, *VERY* welcome change.

[Here is a playlist I created of every STW hero doing BR dances](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcrCEFJcsaroQfV0gXuWehNRsTg7khw-K). Barring extremely minor clipping issues, and props not always lining up correctly, every STW hero is capable of dancing without their model breaking.

It's high time Epic added the rest of the STW cast to BR. ",FortNiteBR

3. Slide should come back as an LTM. That was fun as hell.
4. Vaulting of Thermal and Scoped Revolver. Why keep them, thermal is useless and scoped is literally a worse hand cannon and scoped ar combined.
5. Return of bouncers. Why‚Äôd they go?
6. Changes to arena mode to help meet the pro‚Äôs standards. 20 minutes to get into a match is absurd. I suggest an AI of some sort. More of a long term thing.

All I'm saying is as fun as it is to play Arena for 3 days, get to 300 points, then wait 30 min to play professional level games as a causal player, I'd much rather have fun with my not-so-good friends in regular squads and duos. Yes, this is THEIR game and they can do what they want. But when at the very least 75% of the player base is frustrated, you have to at least make a comment about it.",FortNiteBR

WAIT...

***My Intentions:***

The ai, is going to take the data from all the challenges and do them

The ai, is going to look at the map, the storm, the circle, the time till the storm closes, and how far he is from the circle to predict the best time to go into the map

The ai is going to look at its own health and shields to se if he needs to heal up(Same with mats)

The ai is going to look at its inventory, and the loot on the ground to determine which is better(Thats the easiest)

(Know for the hardest)When the ai is in a fight it will determine all of the opponents possible moves based on data he has already gathered and find the best way the kill him.

When the ai is playing duo or squads, it will see their teammates health and shields and give them stuff based on it. And if teammate is downed, it will find the best way the revive him depending on where he's at (Either sneaking or attacking)

Oh, and it will take the vechiles using its storm and enemy data, and see if the vechiles would be good at the situations.

2) A smaller skill gap.  Everyone pools into the same lobby but Epic designs the game so low level players still have a chance at getting kills/winning.

Looks to me like something really, really shady is going on, and not from Epic. The artist ""drew"" that ""OC"" two times, with quite a time gap between the two. Now of course that alone doesn't really mean anything, but I looked through the artist very, very extensive gallery over all of his accounts and only 2 of his drawings are watermarked, the 2 of his design ""stolen"" by Epic. Now, that again is just a coincidence again, maybe the artist just went back and put the watermark because of what happened.

Now for what is the best case against it, the dates, they speak for themselves right? The artist made the first drawing a whole 2 years before the first leak so there's absolutely no doubt that Epic should be burned at the stakes right? Well I guess most of you (Like me) have never used deviantArt before, well there's a feature in deviantArt that allows you to edit your pictures information, but also the whole picture itself! And there's no edit history or even a little quip that says ""Edited"" anywhere on the page. For proof, here's what someone (@forceinunison) did on twitter

https://www.deviantart.com/cyphrusffxi/art/Karate-Kick-138054274

That's the Taro render, but look at the date? It was posted in 2009? That's a bit crazy, how did this man get the Taro render 10 years before the skin was released?

That's all I guess, does that mean Epic is innocent? Not really, those are merely observation and I could be totally wrong, but the only thing we can go on to say that Epic has stolen is the word of a 13 years old kid, that's it. Ask yourself some question people, what does epic have to win with this? The design isn't even good. And the hard evidence is nothing but rubbish (Literally the only thing people go on off is the date)

So let's all cool ourselves a little bit and think about it and wait for an official word before throwing that much shit towards Epic (Specially on Twitter, those people are more than ready to make a thousand hit piece without looking at all the facts)",FortNiteBR

People keep posting polls from streamers‚Äô twitters, or pointing out how this subreddit disagrees with it as an argument as to why this update should be reverted. In reality, Reddit / Twitter is the huge minority of Fortnite players.

Fortnite has around 250 million players. Nick eh 30 recently posted a poll where 109,000 people voted for the update to be reverted. What you guys don‚Äôt seem to realize is that, first of all, these streamers have a huge following that will agree with anything they say. That 109k is literally 0.000436% of Fortnite‚Äôs playerbase, and that 0.000436% is the ‚Äúsweaty‚Äù minority that actually watches streamers and play competitively.

Yeah, there are definitely a few million more who don‚Äôt like the update and didn‚Äôt vote on this poll, but the number of casuals/noobs far outweighs the people who are so against this.

Most people are either glad its changed back, or don‚Äôt give a shit. The company is obviously doing what the majority of its fanbase wants. They don‚Äôt mind too much about upsetting the streamers, because they won‚Äôt stop playing. It‚Äôs how they make money, they‚Äôll play it whether they like it or not. Most of them probably reached a point where they were sick of playing fortnite and got bored of it, but they kept playing anyway. This is the same situation.

Now my biased opinion: Streamers and ‚Äútry-hards‚Äù (only using that for lack of a better word) are salty because they can‚Äôt recklessly go on a killing spree without being punished anymore. Why should you get a reward/bonus for playing recklessly with no strategy?",FortNiteBR

It would save so many people from getting insta thirsted, ( if thirsted, the player gains no other extra health aside from what you gained while next to downed player)

Less action.

If you ask me, downtime, risk analysis, and tension are key components to Battle Royale.  You're supposed to have quiet moments, you're supposed to question if combat is the right choice, you're suppose to have tense moments of barely being able to heal, you're supposed to worry if someone else is right around the corner to 3rd party you.

If all you're doing is running from fight to fight and not thinking about if you're prepared enough or are in a good place for a fight, then its just death match, not battle royale.",FortNiteBR

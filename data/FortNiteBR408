I then emailed epic and heard nothing back for a week. 

On a whim I decided to send one more email in last night and this morning I checked my emails and I got a response they then asked for my account details etc which I filled in 

30 minutes later I get a response and what do you know they said they put 2000 on my account because of the delayed response and I got to keep the v bucks 

This is now my favourite games company and I will keep supporting them for years to come

Stuff like this happened on other games (friend reset my cod rank on April fools) treyarch did nothing they never responded and all I got was a confirmation email saying they would get to it ASAP 
 
Please do not do what happened to me to try and get free v bucks just buy them and support epic for being the most supportive to their community

Edit - it seems like people can’t read I said I bought it by accident last Monday and sent an email in and got no response I didn’t want it refunded after a week",FortNiteBR

Debated for a few minutes if I wanted to do it. I hate the experience of teammates placing markers on 4 different spots on the map. Nevertheless, I went in.

All 4 teammates dropped at fatal fields. Good start. 2 died and 1 got downed due to no weapons but I took out the other team and revived my teammate. Finished looting and had to bust it to the next circle with my last teammate. 

On the way I realized he had a mic. Young kid (10-12 would be my guess), talking to his little brother. Little brother keeps asking questions: LB-“what is that purple wall”
BB -“oh no! That’s the storm, I need to run”

LB-“why can’t you run?”
BB-“I’m stuck in the lake water, I’m going to die in the storm”

I built a flat platform out to my teammate to help him across. He got downed from the storm right on the edge. Just as I’m reviving we got flanked. Took out those two guys and finally my teammate starts to talk to me.

Next thing I know, there’s 8 left. I build a tower for us to use. Teammate is low on health so I run to a neighboring hill near PP to pick up some bandages I see for him. We have to wait it out because of our poor loot pool. 

6 left. Team of 4 and us. teammate gets excited because he’s never made it this far and his school bus is coming any second and he can’t miss it. Pressure is on. Two on a hill. Two flanking us. I sniped one on the hill. He’s down. Other teammate pushes down. Our base gets destroyed as I take out that second opponent. Other two flank us and kill my self and teammate. I felt bad I couldn’t get him his win. 

Regardless, he was really appreciative of my help and going back to save him 2 times and get bandages for him. Thanked me profusely. 

I hope he caught his school bus in time!

TLDR: helped teammate to second place, his highest finish, before his school bus came.

Call of Duty honestly has the best killfeed I remember a game having.

It shortens the killfeed to important info only with no extra flourishes, telling you who shot, with what, and who died. With the addition of kill distance for snipers, it'd actually be kind of cool if they just implemented that across all weapons. This would bring excitement/salt levels to new heights when you realize how far away that guy was that hit you with a crazy revolver/white SMG shot.

Epic needs to turn the friendly fire back on. I was playing a round of squads with my friends the other night. We were all in a party communicating and executing everything together. We got down to the top 20 and decided to push another squad's massive fortress. We ended up sneaking around the back without being noticed. I had an orange RPG with ~20 rounds. As my three squad mates rushed inside, I leveled everything with the RPG. We annihilated the squad in less than 10 seconds. While cool to just destroy everything like that, the lack of friendly fire just let me mindlessly throw 'splodes everywhere without any regard to my teammates' safety. The removal of FF has  removed the need to be tactical in these kinds of situations. With FF, I most definitely would have downed all of my squad mates during the exchange and as a result, would not have thrown 'splodes and the fight would have been a little more interesting. For the sake of competition and the tactical aspect of the game, the FF needs to come back.",FortNiteBR

I was thinking that maybe they can add 3 LMGs to the game. They would work like this: Either spawn a lot more heavy ammo around the map or make a new bullet type between medium and heavy bullets. LMGs would be SUPER strong for destroying walls BUT would make you run really slow while running with it out, strafe slow, and would take a long time to reload. I was thinking the basic level LMG that could spawn frequently could be like a RPK that spawns in common and green. Then a Stoner 63 that spawns in green, blue, purple. Then a M60 that spawns in purple and gold. Opinions? Also these would be super nice in squads for cover fire when rushing or reviving a team mate. ",FortNiteBR

It's fast, it's smooth, and if you're skilled enough (and your bullets don't go through people and if you don't have high ping), you'll probably win most of the gunfights you encounter. I understand that the big thing that makes this game stand out from all the other games is the building, and that's fine!

I've read Epic want's to push visual fidelity over ""frame-rate"" but this is a shooter. First-Person or Third-Person shooters should always choose ""frame-rate"" over visuals. ESPECIALLY ones that are high paced like Fortnite BR. The Xbox One and PS4 are perfectly fit to run this game at 1080p(PS4) and 900p(Xbox One) at 60fps. Turning ""Uncapped Frame Rate"" on can show it's more than possible. It seems to run around the 40-60 mark easy. While holding 60 when out of combat.

I know how Epic loves to show off UR4's Post Processing but come on. If my laptop with NO dedicated Graphics Card or even a GPU to begin with, can run this game at 1080p, w/ 720p Rendering Res. at 45-60fps, the consoles can hold an easy 60. ",FortNiteBR

To the people claiming the current mechanic is harmful to the game, how you would address the argument that having one less inventory space due to the second shotgun is balanced? While popular streamers may use this effectively, I believe their inventory space is less important than most players since their encounters often leave them with most of their health. I couldn't justify using a second shotgun over a spot for heals/sniper/rpg. Again if this is mainly a problem for PC, then that's a different discussion entirely.",FortNiteBR

I play on a PS4 won twice only had the game a few weeks. I constantly find myself in the top 5 however getting a win is still pretty elusive for me as I’m not a great builder and panic sometimes while trying to build while I’m being shot. I just don’t have it down yet but I practice so hopefully in the future I’ll get it down. So not the best player yet not the worst either kinda middle if you ask me. 
      Now on to the issue. Here I am playing the game went from white weapons to some purples and some blues. Currently doing the shotgun challenge for the day. I end up playing my butt off and getting 11 kills. Long story short I make it to the small circle. Just me and one other person. I have full shields and full health with my purple shotgun. This is where the problem starts. There’s nobody else. I destroy all trees there weren’t any bushes the circle is only a few feet wide I look up and nobody is there. This phantom guy doesn’t exist. Did the game not count my last kill as a final kill? Well now the circle is gone and the storm is at 100% and my health is going down fast! I die! The message says I killed myself and so and so is the winner. Only he’s nowhere close to where the final circle was nor did he take any damage from the storm he’s just dancing in it. I go to report him but as I’m not killed by him it didn’t have his name. There was no player list, he wasn’t on my players Met nothing. I feel cheated. I know it’s an issue on PC but I never thought PS4 would have issues. Maybe I’m Naïve but really doesn’t fair fight auto ban hackers ",FortNiteBR

If you have a damage reduction while in bushes you can have a chance to do at least something after the first shot instead of just dying on spot from a sniper shot. I can't think of any negative.

Edit: To clarify I'm talking about people hiding in bushes doing less damage with long range weapons with like snipers, or maybe the bush being destroyed when you take a shot.

The castle and mansion, the bridge connecting them, the forest surrounding the area and the ruins, it seemed like the next best thing to Tilted Towers.

This is why I was suprised to see when I was gliding towards Haunted Hills for my first time on the map, that there was not another player heading towards Haunted Hills either. When i finally landed I realized something pretty quickly, and that was that there was virtually no loot inside of the castle(if you can even call it that).  

I also realized it wasn't really on a hill, nor was there a bridge connecting the castle and the mansion, and there was just one chest inside the ""mansion."" I looted the entire place in probably 100 seconds, didn't find very much, and didn't see other players.  

For me this location is far worse in loot then junk junction, which is a shame since it would have been nice to have another stunning place in the west of the map to take away some of the people going to titled towers, but for me and for it seems most players there is little reason to ever head towards the Haunted Hills, ill stick to Snobby shores and junk junction.

The most disappointing thing for me is that the location is nothing more then some low loot ruins, and they complete ignored the redditors art design, i hope they change this location in future patches but until then i have no reason to go there",FortNiteBR

2) I switch from shotgun to pickaxe and when swapping back I end up on my sniper and switch to my scar.. it should have been on my shotgun and switch to grenades.

3) You can see when switching from floor to stairs how it jumps back to floor. If I had build too fast a floor would have been build.

Pls get this upvoted so epic can see it and sort it out.
Not sure how number 2 happend.. never happened before but completely threw me off.

I find myself so many times expecting to see a killcam of my opponents play and strat of how he outplayed me, that i perpetually become surprised and disappointed when i don’t. As a player who is always trying to learn from my mistakes, i can easily say not seeing my killcam after death is one of the most triggering aspects of this game. 

p.s. i know epic you probably already have this in the works, just thought i let you know my thoughts and importance of this feature.

You can choose to win however you want. You don’t need to be gung-ho about everything and get the highest kills. I see nothing wrong with sitting in a bush at the edge of the storm. I get that it seems cheap and not fun but there are easy ways to kill a camper and I like the feeling of sneaking around with a bolt action sniper on a hill waiting for some unlucky person to run below me. My friends keep berating me over how I play. I win about the same amount of times as my friends though.

It provides an unfair advantage/handicap to whomever is lucky enough to find the large potion.  9 times out of ten if you come across someone at full shield and your not at least at 50 yourself it’s a death sentence.   (If the person with full shield has any type of skill at the game).   By lowering max to 50 it still provides the advantage and the desire to go looking for a shield but it’s not a death sentence if you happen to come across someone with a shield and you have nothing.   You could even say max 75 with the slurp juice, now people will have to make a choice to use juice to buff to 75 or hold onto it for health benefits.  The extra 100 health is just too much IMO, and the current mechanic just makes shields too op.  There  should be an advantage if you have a shield as its part of the core gameplay to go scavenging,  just not this large of a disparity between full shields and no shields.

*side note* I have plenty of time and wins in this game so the “git gud” comments please keep to yourself.  Curious as to how experienced players view this. 

*edit* people seem to be missing my point.  I don’t want to take away the advantage of having a shield.  I’m saying the advantage you get at a full shield over someone who hasn’t been lucky enough to have found a shield yet is too much.  Keeping the max at 50 still gives you an advantage but it takes away the “necessity” of obtaining a shield.  No other item in the game feels like a necessity to have.  It’s nice finding rare guns but in no way does it feel like a necessity like it does for finding shields. ",FortNiteBR

Chest delays have returned in full force.

Picking up weapons/ammo takes ages (if it even works at all)

Building takes longer than it used to, pressing circle, triangle x2 quickly to get steps, often just places the flat panel.

Cycling between traps or building material is incredibly slow.

But the worst thing is being shot through walls after you've built them. It used to be that as soon as you built a wall it would absorb incoming bullets. Now theres at least a second where bullets go straight through your wall (is this intentional?). This one for me is absolutely game breaking, the amount of times I've died through my walls is incredibly irritating.

Epic, i'd love an official comment on the being shot through freshly built walls, wether or not its intentional and if you are looking into it?

Thanks!

2. Reduced the audio when close to chests

Anyone else found other hidden things they've done? The XP change happened during the Silenced Pistol update, which is a week after Battle Pass hit. My guess is that they realized how fast people were climbing, and maybe wanted to get some money off of it. I'm not judging, but at least tell us.

The shimmer audio from chests' radius has been reduced as well. An example is the iron bridge between [Salty Springs and Retail Row](https://i.imgur.com/sE5uwIe.jpg). There is a chest spawn in the small structure below the bridge on the left side. The chest would be audible standing in the middle of the stairs leading to the structure, but not anymore. The audio from chests in Save the World was a lot less audible than in Battle Royal. I'm thinking they've made the same audio range to complement eachother.

Any other hidden changes? I can't bother to document these, but looking at old Fortnite footage does show a difference in both XP and Chest audio. I'm just curious as to why it wasn't shown in the patch notes.",FortNiteBR

It is unmatched like any other company. They have probably thought about some of these but I have a couple suggestions

-5 Tier Start

Don’t get me wrong I like the idea and the incentive to buy the battle pass before season end but I feel it’s nothing special. The first 5 tiers have nothing that cool or fan driven to unlock so I thought they should make the 5 tiers to be used as a personal decision.  Whether you wait until Tier 65 or use at the end of season I think this gives a bigger incentive to buy the battle pass. Not only that but you will get the people who forget to use the 5 Tier boost -&gt; advantage Epic. 

-Wins

I see why Epic maybe does not want to add a win incentive but I think it’s necessary. I would love to see a win equal a star or if that’s too much maybe every 3, 5, or something. Maybe do 

Solo win = Star
Duos win = .5 star
Squad win = .25 Star 

And split the star between the team but I feel the need for an incentive 

-Challenges 

I think the challenges are great but I would like to make them better. More challenging and maybe the idea of a Battle Pass Challenge. Something that you have the entire battle pass season to accomplish and the reward could be a pickaxe, skin, you name it.

Does anyone else think the cheapest bucks option is a bit pricey lol like seriously. 

Hear me out. Giving a 4.99 option for 500 vbucks would be a great addition to Epics Marketplace. 
Give no incentives to buy that option tho.

Most the time i want something I'm only like 200 vbucks away. Having a 500 vbucks option would solve that issue

And make the 9.99 option 1000 vbucks with an extra 200 vbucks incentive. That way blue skins cost exactly $10 since theyre 1200 vbucks purple skins would be $15 since theyre 1500 vbucks. 

You'd buy both the 4.99 and 9.99 option and have 1700 vbucks spend 1500 on a purple skin and have 200 vbucks left over for a glider or clap emote.

And the epic skins would still remain at around the $20 price point. 

In my opinion this gives more incentive to buy skins, gliders and axes. It's better for the community especially those like myself that can't afford to shell out $10 everytime we want a skin or such. Giving a option at 5 dollars helps the little people and big people all together. 

And like I said, it would probably turn out to be in epics favor because 1. They're still making money and 2. It's cheaper for the consumer thus more purchases to the merchant.


If you guys think this is a good idea plz upvote it. I'd like to get that 4.99 option in the game. 🙏🙏

However, as time has passed and people have invested countless hours in to the game, the lethality of RPG's has been brought to the forefront. 

More than ever, last fights are now decided by which squad has the RPG, or which squad has more rockets. The massive one-hit-kill radius (unless you are shielded up) makes the use of most guns trivial by comparison, especially when the enemy will be building walls anyways. From my last 2-hour play session, our squad lost at least 3 final fights due to the enemy squad having a plethora of RPGs to fire our way; you can build and run, but eventually one will hit you, especially on console where you can't build nearly as fast as on PC.

This problem has been exacerbated by the map update, which added many more POI's and with them, chests. It now seems like almost every final fight is an RPG(or grenade launcher) slugfest, and if your team was unlucky enough to not find one, you lose. In my opinion, this significantly lowers the expression of skill in the game. Yes, if you are good with building, you can play around them, but it's not nearly as fun as nail-biting shotgun showdowns with each team frantically building walls and stairs.

The solution? I propose either A) A decrease in RPG drop rate, to at the very least scale back the RPG drop amounts to pre-update, or B) A decrease in the damage that the RPG does to enemies, while keeping damage to forts the same. It's splash damage would still be useful against groups of enemies bunkered in forts, but it wouldn't be so frustrating to play against.

I’m fairly new to BR and have never really played an FOS game regularly at all. Was able to snag two wins on PC within my first few days of playing and then moved to PS4; have not won since. I feel really good about map awareness and loot routes, but combat seems to be holding me back a bit. 

I’ve tried the double pump strategy, but I’m not sure when that is best used. I generally prioritize AR/Pump/Tac shotgun when looting, but I don’t really have a good grasp of why those tend to be best other than that shotguns are great for short distances.  

What makes certain weapons “good” in fortnite other than simply doing more DPS (or not, subs seem pretty unpopular but have high DPS free my experience)?

But one of them can not resist shoting at a player once he sees them no matter the range or where my other friends and I are located. So we could be on a hill scouting for enemies and he'll run off in a direction without telling us what he's doing. Then he will say something like ""oh shit, I see a guy"" and before I can suggest to regroup and take them on together or even figure out where this enemy is and decide if it's smart to engage he is already unloading on the enemy and his squad. So now my other teammates and I have gotten into a fight we arnt close to and sometimes dont even know the location of. This can turn a lot of different ways like winning the fight and getting a lot of loot followed by my trigger happy teammate thinking that engaging was a great idea, wining and then getting destroyed by other squads atracted by the gunfire, but most often its my teammate getting downed because he can't take on a squad alone and then getting finished off by the enemies for his loot and then him getting mad at the rest of the group for not saving him.

Ping plays a big role in Fortnite BR as it affects how fast you can build, how fast you can swap weapons/building objects, and the overall responsiveness for console.  With my current ping there is a major delay when switching to build and when swapping between weapons/building objects.  

Please prioritize the plan of spinning up more data centers for better average ping as mentioned in the State of Development V2 posted 3 months ago.

With less cities and more open space, I felt as though there was more opportunity to determine your playstyle. With more space between cities, people who preferred to play passively could traverse with little conflict. With fewer total areas, aggressive players were likely to come across many players if they landed in a landmarks.

Now, with so many landmarks, I feel as though both ends of this spectrum have been tapered off. With much less space between cities and standalone houses, it is much more difficult to avoid high traffic areas. However, because there are so many landmarks, high traffic areas no longer have the amount of players that they used to. Instead of 5-10 people landing in a city, there seem to be only 2 or 3.  By giving the players so many options, each area becomes less populated.

Even though the second game 6 of my kills were due to a very clever trap I placed in Tilted Towers (4 insta killed, 2 injured and then I eliminated them). 

The main problem I have on pc is just how potent building is combined with peeking with 1/64 of you head showing. I saw a good player (circle on water in loot lake) build a 6 story tower in legit 15 seconds. I went to shoot out the bottom (no explosives) and boom instantly dead (sniped).

Many reports and [even a few memes of the audio issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7rdlss/sound_design_in_fortnite/?st=jcmqq4e1&amp;sh=d28552a4) are out there. 

A source of many of these audio problems is likely this: 

***The audio direction and location is not based on your character but your camera position.***

What happened that made me realize what was going on was this.

I was standing below a chest on a 3 story stair case in the shipping container yard. I looked down, and the chest got louder, so I went down. The chest wasn't there and got quieter.

My teammate went above and opened the chest and it hit me.

The reason why the chest got louder was because my CAMERA was closer to the chest, not my character. So when I moved my camera away from the chest, it obviously got quieter.

I only realized this today, and realized that there was another older game with an option that handled this issue. It's game engine also handled audio based on camera position, but it also had an option to make sound Character Based. If you flipped the switch you'd only hear audio based on where your character was standing and looking. So no matter where your camera is, your audio would be based on your character's head PoV position.

*Fortnite does not do this, instead your audio Point of View is positioned on the camera's location in the game.*

You can test this out yourself too. Go find a chest and look at it, then look away from it and look back again. The chest gets louder when you look away from it because your camera is closer to the chest.

Here is a Video Demonstration: https://streamable.com/hhyh3

When playing a First Person Shooter, this isn't a problem because we're all used to camera based sounds because we are playing from the character's point of view.

But in a 3rd Person Shooter, we assume the same position, except we are looking at our character, but we still perceive audio the same way. We want to hear audio based on the Character's perspective. 

We do this automatically and subconsciously, it is natural for us to expect and assume the position of the character.

This is why there is confusion on location of players in the game, because were looking in a direction and getting a counterintuitive and incorrect feedback based on this audio system.",FortNiteBR

But right behind that is the ABSOLUTE lack of skill that shotguns require. They aren't aimed, they are shot and prayed that your pellet spread hits more than the other persons pellet spread while the 18 tick server tries to calculate the hitboxes of each character as they jump around like maniacs spamming shotgun shots.

ADS? No need with shotguns, just jump around like an idiot.
Actual aiming involved? Nope, just aim somewhere around the person and hope the Server registers more pellets than the other guy.
Crouch to Aim better? Not with shotguns, go ahead jump off that building the bullet trajectory is not affected by movement.
228 damage headshot if you get lucky? Absolutely, why would we want this gun to do less?


Seriously, I have lost more games more recently to dumbass Bunny Hopping shotgun fights that aren't skill based at all, it's two people not aiming, not crouching, not doing anything remotely good at the game just trying to dodge pellet registry from the other person and at that point it's a fucking 50/50 coinflip. 

It's not fun, its not good, and my god when the new combat update comes in and shooting the AR / Pistols get harder I hope shotguns are addressed or they will be WAY more abusive than they are now and they are already the worst part of the game outside of Rocket Spamming. 

**EDIT:** To put it in more simple terms I want to feel like I am out aiming the other guy, that I out shot him. This is why EVERYONE generally LOVES the feel of sniper shots. Because hitting them feels like you AIMED and out skilled the other player. Smashing shotguns at each other has never felt rewarding in this game. Most streamers AVOID finishing games with shotguns, because they don't feel like they require ANY skill at all to use, or win with. Using them isn't rewarding and losing fights when some guy is jumping mid air hitting 200dmg headshots vs your pellets registering for 30 damage criticals, feels like ass. Hey I hit his HEAD, but the server only registered 2 pellets. Wonderful! That guy jumping around managed to hit 7 pellets all on my head, no penalty for being MID-AIR.

That doesn't feel good, Sniping someone feels good, because it requires AIM and skill, Hitting a long range 1 tap with a pistol or revolver FEELS good because it feels like you had to really try to hit it. Shotguns feel like ass, and the worst part is they are used in 90% of battles. I hate them, and it's making me hate the game. ",FortNiteBR

I haven't enjoyed gaming this much since the release nearly MW2. This is just a list of ideas I have thought of or seen all in one place that could be used to make Fortnite even better than it is now! Not all of these changes are neccessary, however, it would be nice to have Epic see this list so they are aware of some of the things that might need changing in future patches. If I have not given people credit, I apologise, the list is too long for me to go find the OP's of some of these ideas. 

*  First off the spectate mode needs a serious overhaul. I understand that they don't want teammates to be massive helpers but seriously, there is no reason we should be forced to spectate with no HUD, no map, no crosshairs, no teammates names. One really annoying thing is not being able to see damage numbers coming off enemies in spectate mode. This needs to be updated so I can actually enjoy spectating. 

* Now that there is no more friendly fire in squads and duos, going into your inventory screen should also show you your team mates inventories.

* Be able to spectate your friends while they are in a game and you are in the lobby. I again understand that this may be not wanted due to the previous argument listed, but when I see a friend that is in a game with 10 alive, I want to watch and gee up so badly. - maybe have a 1-minute delay on the spectate? 

* You should be able to continue running whilst in the inventory. Controls for this should be the right-stick or d-pad. It would be much easier to make inventory changes on the go, especially when running from the storm.

* I think that bushes (item and map-bushes) are a good meta in the game; they offer the chance to win to almost anyone. They cater to people who enjoy the stealthy playstyle. That being said, it is far too difficult to see or notice whether someone is in a bush or not, I shouldn't have to shoot a bush to see if someone is in it. Ideally there would be something that would indicate that someone is in it; maybe make it shake/ shimmer every [designated time] or have a different colour, or feet just poking out the bottom very slightly. Also, after using the bush item, there should be some way to remove the bush. It seriously takes up half your screen and if someone is standing 5-10m in front of you in a close fight you legitimately cant see them.

* If your bandages stack over 15 when picking up some more, it should not drop your weapon, but rather pick up the exact amount to get to 15 for one stack. No one ever needs more than 15 bandages.

* Mini-shields, bandages and grenades should auto pick-up if you already have some in your inventory.

* When in spectator mode other teammates should have a glow around them that is visible through walls, eg. CS:GO. This one can maybe be skipped, as it is a bit gimmicky and takes some skill out of the game. I do think that it is fair enough just for the fact that when you're in your forts, sometimes its a clusterfuck trying to find which level people are on and what not.

* Console players should be able to bind their own controls. It's surely not too much time or effort to allow this to happen. As well as this, players should be able to switch the order of their building/ assign buttons eg. R1, R2, L1, L2. Also, at the moment there is a bit of delay on console after pressing the build button to being able to rotate through your build options. The delay is really slight, but when I am in a hectic close encounter fight and want to build, I know that I just have to press circle, R1, R1 to get my ramp. So I smash it really quickly but instead of taking me to my ramp, I will instead change a gun and only move one step across to the floor due to the delay. Please change this.

* Kill cams. Final kill cam at least. So many times I think I'm in the all clear and just get killed out of knowhere. It'd be nice to know how you died. 

* After you win the game, give 10 seconds of running around/ emote time to celebrate your win. It would be funny to see all the creative celebrations people would do after winning. Allowing building in this time would be cool too. I saw an idea to even pick an emote that will automatically play when you win. There should 
also be a ""podium"" shot almost of you and your squad doing a victory pose or whatever like in COD:WW2
* There should be some challenges or achievements which give you awards. Even if its as simple as a different colour umbrella for amount of wins. Green - 5, Red - 10, Blue - 20, Purple - 50, Gold - 100. [This post](https://i.redd.it/p6pyqohwema01.png) on the front page of this subreddit is a good idea for it. Maybe have a different texture for each of solos, duos and squads. I understand that this is a free game and we shouldn't ask for much when they already give us so much, But I do think wins should be more meaningful and have more use than just padding your stats. At the moment I have 34 wins over all my game modes. Winning now isn't the best feeling cause I don't really get much out of it and there is no goal for me to strive for. You should at least get a battle star for a win with a limit of 5 a day.

* Another post I saw recently was allowing us to build a tombstone by unselecting all of the squares in edit mode except for the bottom middle one. This would be fun for the disrespect to both team mates and enemies after their deaths.

* Add a leave as party option. If I am in duos and one of us dies early, sometimes we leave party to speed up the games. Leaving the game removes you from party, and then sometimes I accidentally ready up and get into a que for solos because I didn't realise I had left the party.


* I feel like explosives are too strong against players, especially in the end game. They are neccessary for the game since building is an option, my suggestions are to either add a blast shield type deal that gives special shield just for explosives, or just lower the actual area of the explosives deal damage to. The explosives are meant for breaking Forts. It's extremely sad to lose a game due to a guy just spamming RPG's at you.

* The end of the game stats should show a the line that you traveled over the map and highlight the kills along the way. Idea taken from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/7r716g/suggestion_when_you_finish_a_match_die_or_win_the/)


Bugs

* The weapons not picking up glitch has been happening so much more recently. Not sure if something has changed but this needs to be fixed eventually. 

* I'm not sure if the sniper and shotgun glitches are real or not, but I have definitely had times with each which have made me think WTF after shooting through him. If this is a bug then it needs to be fixed.

* Recently I had a glitch that so far I have not been able to recreate. It is a bit difficult to explain so I will give it a go. I was in a fort and I was looking at another guy in a fort about 100m away. I was moving back and forth on my ramp to pop my head out and take cover. It was either my wall or his wall that was a bit broken, but when I moved back and forth passed my wall, I would see a split second shadow/silhouette of his full body through the wall. Made it really easy to snipe him.

* If you are switching to a bandage or shield and spamming R2 to use the item, sometimes a 'fake shot' comes from your gun. The gun sounds and feels like it just shot, giving away your position to enemies, but not actually firing the bullet.

* Sometimes, when building, your building rotates to try to fit the terrain and then  stays locked in that rotation. Can lead to annoying deaths. 





Additions

* I think the Fortnite combat system is seriously fucking fun. When I play, I often just jump to the most popular areas and run around killing as many people as I can, rather than actually trying to win. There should be some ways we can play this game without having to play a survival based game mode. I think that some form of either 1v1 duels, 2v2 or 4v4 duo and squad battles that take place in various POI's of the map. This could be similair to a counter strike search and destroy type mode, or even a straight out deathmatch. Some people argue ""this is a battle royale survival game, dont try to change it"". That argument is silly IMO. Why limit the enjoyment we can have with this great unique combat system and force us into one game mode. With 40 million players atm I think that there would be no issues with ""stealing"" some of the player base to these other game modes. If they were to create some of these game modes, it would ensure so much more longevity to the game. I'm not sure how long I will be able to continue just with the battle royale mode for a year or so.

* Similar to the last point, I think that the ability to create custom matches would be a very solid addition to this game. First off, there needs to be a sandbox/practice mode to practice building and to an extent shooting. It should just be a small portion of the loading island with some resources, guns and target dummies. Being able to create a private match with 1 mate just to test certain things out would be really beneficial, and it would also be fun as fuck to be able to 1v1 your friends.

* For limited time game modes, I think that a Snipers/pistols or snipers/shottys game mode would be an enjoyable addition. I saw a good idea of having it as a 'Wild West' type mode with only snipers, revolvers and pump shotties.


Edit:

More things on the list


* Duos on OCE all the time! Having duos only online from 4-11:30 is seriously shit. After 11:30 all of squads is just duos that cant play anymore cause the servers have shut. I get that Epic wouldn't want to restrict their players from playing with each other, but how often do you have 4 people who can play at the same time not during peak times? I think duos should always be available as it is much more competitive.

*  Although I love the new map so far, I feel like we might have just gotten too many POI's. I used to think that the east side had maybe 1 too many, but now the west side has probably more POI's than the east. I feel like it just spreads out the population base too thin for there to be exciting games from all of the players. An idea might be to have rotating POI's so they can make the most out of the POI and the models, but reduce the amount lf drop locations for players.


If there is anything you feel that I have missed or should be added, let me know and I will add them on.

Since about 2 patches ago i've been getting the error shown in the screenshot. It goes as follows: I click on launch in the launcher, the game starts, the loading screen loads to about 95% of the bar on the bottom of the screen and then the error happens.

The weird thing about it is that the error doesn't happen ever single time. If i restart the game anywhere between 5 - 10 times, the game launches normally.

Ofcourse this is an extremely irritating error, and having to restart super often is getting too annoying. I've tried googling and i've seen many people experiencing the same problem posting on the epic games forums. I haven't seen a solution or a response from Epic themselves which is why im posting this here.

Anyone experiencing the same or found a solution? I've tried running in administrator, clicking verify in the launcher, reinstalling the game. Nothing has fixed it.

1. A hang glider: A one time use hang glider that takes up one spot in your inventory. You bring it out, say on top of a mountain, and glide down to your destination.

2. Gas/ Storm grenades: Grenades that produce a smoke similar to that of the smoke grenade but do 2-5 damage per second similar to being in the storm. The storm grenade can be effective against only shields, and the gas grenade against only health. Together they can be a lethal combination.

3. Trip wires: a bit harder to see, the trip wire can be a trap that does about 50 damage if taken directly and head on.

4. Giant bear traps: these giant bear traps should be able to be placed anywhere on the ground, including outside, without needing a true support platform. IT can be made so it somewhat blends in with the ground depending on where placed (if placed outside) and should do about 75 damage.

5. Claymore mines: These are self explanatory as far as traps go. Place them down, they go boom. Damage should vary.

6. Bows/ crossbows: The ultimate silent weapon. Both taking the same ammo, arrows, they would be very slow to reload but would do a great amount of damage if hit head on, making almost no noise. so for those bush wookies, they would never see it coming ;)

7. C4: throw it with your shooting button/ key, and detonate with your aiming button/key. one direct hit with these should do the same damage as a direct hit with a grenade, but they could be used for blowing up walls in a base easier than with grenades that bounce off in every single direction.

8. Melee weapon options: We already have the pickaxe used to destroy things and get supplies, but what about actual melee weapons? i sometimes find myself in uncomfortably close combat usually involving shotguns if a bit later in the game. Why not whip out that sword, or nunchucks, heck, even brass knuckles, and beat them to death with it for around 40 damage a hit?

9. Grappling hook for buildings: trying to get up to a tall building like in tilted towers? have no materials? well whip out that grappling hook and toss it up there! careful though, the climbing is slow! and don't miss, you only get one shot!

10. motorcycles/ mopeds: though these would probably be a bit controversial, you could make them work. they would only work for about 10 seconds and then break. they could be the difference between you making it to the circle alive and not! they would be blue/purple loot of course, and would take one slot in your inventory. Just imagine the sick tricks you could do off a mountain in one.

11. Robot dog: find a robot dog as a blue or purple loot and it would take up 1 space in your inventory. this robot dog when used can attack a player within say, 10-15 meters of it and would only have about 50 health.

Being located on the edges of the map would make vehicles very useful for transportation to the circle. Vehicles would have an average amount of health (200-400) depending on size to prevent them from being too tanky. Smaller vehicles like a golf cart, dirtbike or motorbike (with 2nd seat on the side) match the tone and aesthetic of fortnite. The driver of a vehicle would be restricted to using small guns (pistol, smg) and grenades, while passengers could use any weapon. The golf cart would seat 4, with the dirtbike seating 1 and the motorcycle fitting 2. The golfcart would only be about 1.5-2x the sprint speed, while the other vehicles would be slightly faster. When balanced, vehicles could become a very useful tool to travel quickly while the storm is nipping at your butt, but would not be too common as to significantly change the gameplay of fortnite.

For example there was a time I went on my favorite streamers stream(cdn) and said that he inspired me to make YouTube videos and start my own channel and I get flamed. I get that it’s the internet. In reality it doesn’t cost you anything to tell someone they have a decent video and keep up the good content in which it is. But it costs you energy to hate on someone and belittle them because they’re starting a channel. I encourage others that are starting a channel to keep creating new content, and ignore immature folks within the fortnite community. I’ve noticed that people who do hate don’t actually have channels or videos. It’s like if making videos and getting viewers is hard and they can’t do it... Why should they support you and help the process?

I can't tell you how many times I have been top 5 in solos and had a coupe of different people shooting at me. They aren't teaming, but for some reason, they shoot at me/my base and wait to shoot each other till I have been dealt with. It's almost as if the people think ""Oh, a dude with an expensive skin/high level skin, I better deal with him before focusing on anyone else"".

If bloom is removed the game will become competitive where if you are not good at the you have 0% chance to win. I am all for removing bloom. 99% of the shots I miss are from bloom but that’s what keep the game fun.

I would like it if the system would automatically switch and place the next highest value structure automatically if it detects you don't have enough of the currently selected material.

So if I try to place a metal but I don't have enough metal then it just places a brick wall, or a wood wall if I don't have brick either.

Or if I have 200 wood and 200 metal but only 8 brick when I try to place a brick wall, it automatically places metal and switches to the metal ui.
